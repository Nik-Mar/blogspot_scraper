{"title": "10 years of That Extra Level!", "date": "01/02/2024", "text": "That’s right, dear fellow gamers: my modest little blog hit the big 10last december! I was planning to write a celebratory post at that time, whilemaking my grand move to a different hosting site and launching thatextralevel.com.Unfortunately, life derailed that plan by throwing me not a curveball,but the frigging Demon Core itself. I won’t enter details; suffice it to saythat late 2023 was nasty, and that dust is barely beginning to settle onthe battlefield.  This made me realize something I may or may not have touched upon: thatmy gaming activities are a very telling barometer of my mood, and of whatever sh*tis happening in my life at any given time. Long story short: when I’m neck-deepinto problems, I just cannot play games for the life of me, let alone writeabout games. And even if I force myself to play and write at such times, forthe sake of escapism or not giving up on something precious to me, I cannot findjoy in it — heck, I sometimes cannot even muster enough energy to focus on my playingand writing!  The reverse is also true: when things get better, my desire to indulgein all things gaming comes back, often with a vengeance. This is exactly why I’mposting this right now, and why I’ve been gaming again these last weeks. I playedit safe at first, treading on familiar territories: a PokemonScarlet solo run, followed by a revisitation of Sonic Rush, SonicRush Adventure and Sonic Colours. I skipped the final boss battlesin all these runs, because easy ride wanted — and very much needed. Now I’min the mood to get myself some meatier stuff, and to give That Extra Level!some TLC. Stay tuned for more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers, and keepdoing your thing! ^^"},
{"title": "Otome and Gal Games: The Fallout. Kinda. But there’s still hope! ", "date": "18/12/2023", "text": "It’s beenroughly two years and nine months since I last played an otome game; and you’dbe forgiven for thinking that I ditched the genre entirely. Truth be told, Igenuinely didn’t feel like indulging in the genre for all that time; but acouple of weeks ago, the otome itch came back with a vengeance, begging to bescratched immediately. Ni une ni deux, I purchased a bunch ofSwitch otomes and started playing with gusto… only to be slapped in the facewith two unexpected issues.   The firstissue is the content of the involved games. I played Lover Pretend,Charade Maniacs, Radiant Tale, Winter’s Wish and Birushana;and I ditched them all before clearing a single route — sometimes beforeclearing the first chapter. I ditched them all for the exact same reason: thesegames lack a solid story, a compelling game world and endearing and relatablecharacters. They are really just good ol’ romances, taking place between paper-thincharacters in a papier mâché décor. Do I really have the nerve to blame otomegames for featuring romance, you may ask? Nope; I’m just saying thatI don’t fancy such a pure, unadulterated focus on romance.   I realisenow that all the otomes and gal games I dig — Bad Apple Wars, OurWorld is Ended, Norn9, World End Syndrome, Nightshade — are really just solidVisual Novels with some romance on top. More precisely, the romance in thesegames is not handled — and handed — like emotional porn; instead, it is used toadvance the story and underline narrative elements, and it’s always presentedin a way that respects the characters — and thus the player. The romance servesthe story and the characters, not the other way around.   I keptploughing through my pile of Switch otomes, hoping to encounter a gem of thevariety described above; and joy and glory, I finally found it in OlympiaSoirée! No kidding: this game totally has the potential to become a CultClassic of mine. And yet, I ditched it at the beginning of the 3rdroute; and I ditched it for no other reason than my second current issue withotome games, i.e. the way I play them. Or more precisely, the very direadmission that I don’t play them my way, and I haven’t played them myway for a very long time.   Rewindall the way to my first otome game: Amnesia:Memories on the Vita, wayback in November 2015. I had a blast with that game; and one of themajor reasons I enjoyed myself so much is the way I played A:M. I playedit by ear, so to speak: I just picked the paths that seemed interesting, andthe answers that suited my real-life personality best. Heck, I played that gamelike a ‘Choose Your Own Adventure’ book: laughing, gasping and marvelling atthe twists and turns the game threw at me, and being just a good sport thatdidn’t take things too seriously. That light-hearted and playful approachdisappeared pretty quickly though, to be replaced by a typical gamer’s mindset.   Basically,I wanted to win these games, which in my mind translated as gettingthe good endings — preferably while avoiding the bad ones, and without awalkthrough to top it off. This narrow focus on winning nearly made me swearoff Bad Apple Wars, just because the good endings didn’t feel rewardingenough. This focus also made me play the entirety of the mindfuck that is Piofiore,just because I wanted to be that smartass who escaped the game unscathed. Thatdarn stupid focus made me play some otomes entirely and suffer throughshitty routes full of crappy fellows, instead of just zeroing in on the routesthat truly resonated with me. And heck, that royally sucks. However, I’mnot gonna dwell on it any longer: instead, I’ll change my way of playing otomesand gal games and bring the fun back. Right now, I need a break from thegenre in general; but watch out for my grand return! 🤩"},
{"title": "Gaming musings: The backlog pressure", "date": "17/12/2023", "text": "Backlogpressure can take many forms, and mix various subtle feelings. My own backlogpressure feels like a persistent grinding (how ironic) on my gamer’s mind; it’snot overwhelming, but it’s nagging enough to dampen my gaming enjoyment attimes. It often translates as guilt — but not just any guilt. One mightthink I feel guilty every time I purchase a new game — because dear Arceus,there are so many waiting already! — but NOPE! No matter how many games I own,I always get this delicious kick when I get my greedy paws on a new game. Myguilt is all about the way I play my games — or don’t do so. I feelguilty about not playing games I bought ten years ago, about playing a game indepth at the expense of others, about tackling a Nth Pokemonsolo run when there are so many unplayed games waiting in line.   For manyyears, I was totally immune to the backlog pressure; I was happy and proudabout that immunity, and even paraded a bit and flaunted it at times. So whattipped the scales and allowed backlog pressure to worm its way into my gamer’smind? Ithought at first that the sheer accumulation of games was the main factor,which prompted me to devise the New Classics Project. Now that the deed iskinda done, I realise that the situation is more complex. See, as I wasdiscarding games like my life depended on it during the New Classics Project,the backlog pressure didn’t abate like I thought it would. Bet you didn’texpect that plot twist, hey!    After abit of soul-searching, I’ve come to realise that all my backlogging woes can beblamed on a single factor, which is none other than loyalty. More precisely,an excess of it; or an extension of the concept in places where it shouldn’texist. See, I feel a duty of sorts towards my games. I feel that I shouldgive them all a fair chance to shine, and that I shouldn’t discard thembefore giving them said chance; and I just as strongly feel that I contractedthat obligation the very moment I purchased them.   The wholething is just over-the-top, and completely out of place. Loyalty is fine inrelationships with fellow humans, or living beings as a whole; but loyaltytowards objects is just plain unpractical and pointless. I’m basically chainingmyself to stuff, and creating obligations for myself out of thin air! Whenone considers the timing and rationale behind every gaming purchase and realisesthat circumstances may have changed wildly since said purchase, this clutchingto loyalty becomes all the more absurd and counter-productive. Case in point: Ipurchased Tactics Ogre for the PSP back in mi-2013, at a time when I onlyowned the PSP, the DS and 20-or-so games. Ten years later, I own six systemsand hundreds of games, and I’ve come to realise that I don’t fancy SRPG thatmuch. Forcing myself to play Tactics Ogre despite all that was acomplete waste of my loyalty.  But wait,I hear you say, didn’t you want to play Tactics Ogre? What aboutyour gaming instinct? Well, that’s the trick: that loyalty of mine towards everygame I welcome into my Collection superseded my gaming instinct. Or, moreprecisely, my gaming instinct operated inside the confines of my loyaltytowards my games. It speaks volumes that in all these years, I never did any sort of background maintenance ofmy collection: it’s been the same since the very beginning, just growing everlarger. It would have made sense to, let’s say, ditch this game I bought on a completewhim, or that game that belongs to a genre I don’t fancy; but such naturaloccurrences never happened. They never happened because they couldn’t happen:until I uncovered that blinding, binding loyalty of mine, I was simply unableto ditch a game before playing it. Hence the darn backlog pressure.   Does this mean that I am now able to ditch a game without playing it first? I honestly don’t know at that point. Identifying the cause of mybacklog pressure certainly removed a lot of said pressure; the consequences ofthat epiphany on my Collection remain to be seen, and will probably take sometime to unfold. One thing is abundantly clear, though:the New Classics Project is now officially defunct! My gaming instinct will runthe show from now on; and it will do so without being hindered by my overbearingloyalty. This will be some sort of permanent maintenance, like a softwarerunning in the background; and I just cannot wait to see how my gaming instinctwill fare ^^  One lastquestion for the road: what does make a game a Cult Classic? For me, it’salways a natural and effortless gelling between several elements. It’s the waya game scratches just the right itch, while inserting itself perfectly into mylife at that moment and generating tons of emotions and memories. This issomething that cannot be engineered, nor reproduced at will; it can happen withperfectly crappy games, and not happen with undeniably excellent ones. The NewClassics project reminded me that you just have to breathe, relax, and letthings happen. Just play it your way, baby! 🤩"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Lucario Solo Run", "date": "01/12/2023", "text": "Let’s behonest: I’ve never been dying to run solo with Lucario. However, years ofhaving a Lucario forced on me by Korrina in X&Y slowly but surelymade me amenable to the vulpine creature; throw a mega Evolution on top, andyou have a very interested little me. Ofcourse, I wasn’t going to wait for Korrina’s Lucario. I bred and hatched Riolusin my dedicated X cartridge, until I found the perfect critter. The Lucario line normally boasts higher Attack than Sp.Attack, whichdoesn’t quite align with its learnset that mixes Physical and Special moves;however, my Riolu was blessed with a Rash Nature, which meant boosted Sp.Attack— and thus making the most of the line’s learnset.    One tradeand a few steps later, my little Jaspe was all hatched, and ready tocruise Kalos! Riolu’s evolution being based on Friendship level, I couldn’tknow when Jaspe would evolve; as it turns out, she evolved at lv. 34, right atthe end of the fight against Grant. In terms of levels, it’s way later thanwhat you’d expect; that kinda makes sense though, given that I had a double XPboost thanks to the combination of the Lucky Egg and Two Hearts in PokemonAmie.    For thatlast Gen VI run of the summer fall, I decided to spice things up a bit — and man,the Lucario line was more than willing to humour me! We’re talking about themmoves: in all my years of Pokemon solo runs, I don’t think I’ve everwielded combinations such as Normal-Fighting-Ghost-Ground, orPoison-Fighting-Steel-Dragon. So very exotic! Talking about Steel: asyou can see below, Flash Cannon became part of my arsenal. How could that be,when Flash Cannon only becomes available after the credits roll? Simple answer:I cheated, folks. I sent Jaspe to my dedicated breeding Xcartridge, taught her the move, and sent her back to Y. A seldom-usedmove, with a STAB boost cherry on top — sweet! Never mind that I had tocheat, it was totally worth it.  My ultimate Elite Four move pool. After a whole run of delirious one-shooting and glorious blazing through Kalos, it's time to talk about the Elite Four! That final showdown was allthe more thrilling as it was pretty much the only time I used Mega-Evolution,bar the Lysandre fights in Team Flare’s Secret HQ in Geosenge. Why not use itmore, you may ask? First, because regular Lucario is badass enough already;secondly, because using ME would have required dropping the Lucky Egg, and Ireally wanted Jaspe to hit the big 100 before the end without extra grinding.That plan succeeded beyond my wildest dreams: not only did Jaspe reach thatcoveted Lv.100 right on time for the Elite Four, but she reached it during the VictoryRoad fight against Veteran Gilles — a.k.a. the very last trainer before the PokemonLeague. Talk about pitch-perfect timing!  With that said,on with the report of a most interesting Elite Four showdown!  —     Malva: Aura Sphere for all bar Chandelure, which got a nice serving ofDragon Pulse. Needless to say, everybody went down in one clean, devastatinghit.—     Wikstrom: I unleashed Aura Sphere on Klefki, which left me with a nasty caseof Torment as it bit the dust — talk about spite! I had to use Dragon Pulseagainst Probopass, who stomached the hit comfortably and survived with half ofits HP. Fair enough, I finished it with Aura Sphere. Aegislash got a serving ofDig, Scizzor got a serving of Aura Sphere, fight over.—     Siebold: Despite ME, things nearly went south against Clawitzer. Iunleashed Flash Cannon on a whim, only to discover that it wasn’t veryeffective; that allowed Clawitzer to lash back at me with a critical hit,nearly wiping Jaspe out. Siebold produced a Full Restore, forcing me to redo thewhole thing; fortunately, a single Aura Sphere got me rid of the armoredshrimp. Gyarados went down with two Dragon Pulse — but not before Siebold spenthis two remaining Full Restores on it. I was actually uber lucky, because Gyaradosused Dragon Dance on the first turn instead of taking advantage of my depletedHP bar and finishing me with an offensive move. Super effective Aura Sphere onBarbaracle, two serving of Aura Sphere for Starmie — and I was lucky onceagain, as the latter used Light Screen instead of taking advantage of my stilldepleted HP bar. —     Drasna: Flash Cannon, one-shot for all. Nuff said! Actually, no: using aSteel move on Drasna’s posse wasn’t the most strategically sound option,because none of her dragons are weak to Steel. Had I really wanted tosteal the show, I should have used super-effective Dragon Pulse; but hey, noneed to kick a mon when it’s down.  —     Diantha: Critical Flash Cannon on Hawlucha. Flash Cannon on Goodra, which survived with a microgram of HP and retaliated with an offensive move thatLucario skilfully avoided; Diantha’s Full Restore did nothing to help, asGoodra went down the next turn with Dragon Pulse. One-shot Tyrantrum with DragonPulse. Tried to one-shoot his evil twin fellow Aurorus with Dragon Pulseas well, except it survived; Diantha didn’t use a Full Restore, which allowedme to finish Aurorus with Flash Cannon. A single Flash Cannon on Gourgeist, anda glorious single Flash Cannon on Mega Gardevoir.  Them final stats. Not sure I've ever had a mon with equal Attack and Sp. Atk at lv. 100 🤩 The timerat the end of that thrilling showdown indicated 9:50, which is totally one ofmy shortest times — if not the shortest time — ever for an X&Ysolo run. I’ll sure try that again, baby! Until next time, dear fellow gamers,keep doing your thing and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Ruby: The Flygon Solo Run", "date": "30/11/2023", "text": "Gettingan extra serving of Gen III, just because I can! I became fully aware of theFlygon line’s existence as I was cruising through the Desert on route 111 andstumbled upon a Trapinch right as my Repel stopped working. The thing is, I alwayscross the Route 111 Desert on Repels; and this was probably the first time everI encountered a wild Trapinch in Hoenn. My curiosity aroused by this creature,I looked for its evolutions on Bulbapedia — and the rest is history.    My littleBloodstone — which, to quote Wikipedia, is an “opaque green jasper withred inclusions of hematite” — boasted an Adamant Nature, which I deemed perfectas the line’s learnset is overwhelmingly physical. I cheated a bit by sendingthe Dragonbreath TM from my breeding Emerald cartridge, along with the LuckyEgg; but apart from that, I dutifully stuck to the line’s normal learning path. Scroll down to ckeck the evolution of my move pool — and let’s pause to appreciate the subtle irony of a Mon wieldingEarthquake while being totally immune to Ground Moves thanks to Levitate. It shouldsurprise no one that my run was a blazing festival of one-shooting, with littleto no obstruction. I reached the Elite Four at a measly (by my standards) Lv.90, which didn’t prevent me from mopping the flour with basically every Trainerand Mon. In a nutshell: I one-shot everything bar Dusclops, Claydol,Cradily and Armaldo. I spent the whole showdown spamming Flamethrower andDragon Claw, using Earthquake solely for Sealeo and Walrein and not usingReturn at all. Strange fact: Steven sent Metagross in third place, whichI didn’t even know was possible — didn’t do anything to help his case, though. A coupleof other queer things happened during that run. First, my team of Zigzagoonspicked up an uncannily low number of Rare Candies — roughly ten over the wholerun, which is definitely the lowest performance I’ve seen on that front.Incidentally, I also gave them names this time around; and I couldn’t help butfeel paranoid about a causal link — even though I was probably just unlucky,and we were dealing with a correlation.    Secondly, and more sinisterly: as I booted my GBA one fateful day, the cartridge informed me that I haderased my save data, and presented me with a New Game opening screen. I feltthe blood drain from my face, and stood there frozen for a couple of seconds —before using the tried-and-tested trick of rebooting my GBA. This time, my savefile appeared as normal, and I uttered a giant sigh of relief. A bit ofresearch revealed that this is a documented occurrence; it might be due toconnectivity issues, or to the cartridge just plainly getting old and startingto fail. Well, be it; I’ll write another day about the obsolescence of allpieces of kit, and the impermanence of gaming as a whole. For now, I’m sailingtowards new and exciting runs, of Pokemon or else. Take care, dearfellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sapphire: The Delcatty Solo Run, Part 2: Harder, better, faster, stronger", "date": "29/11/2023", "text": "Let’scruise again with Delcatty, baby! A bout of pre-trade breeding in Emeraldlanded me a Skitty with a Quiet Nature, which was tailor-made to make the mostof Delcatty’s late-game move pool. This time around, I also had the Lucky Eggat my disposal; and I was gonna use it, as it was part of the point of redoingthat whole run. I didn’t only send the Lucky Egg to my Sapphire cartridge, mindyou; I also sent a Moon Stone, as I wanted to make that run a fullDelcatty run. Of course, that choice came with the massive sacrifice of renouncingany new moves until I could get my paws on TMs; but I was ready to risk beingstuck with Tackle for eons, for the sake of stat boost and satisfying myscientific curiosity.    And so,my Cherry Pie got to evolve as soon as he stepped out of its shell. Youread that right, dear fellow gamers: my feline lone ranger was male this timearound, which significantly reduced the hassle against Roxanne. Both of herfemale ‘Mons made the fatal mistake of using contact moves and became infatuatedwith my adorable kitten, wasting a couple of turns as a result. Factor in theoomph granted by that early evolution and a couple of Battle Items, and you getthe easiest Cat-vs-Rock battle of all times. Fun fact: these two Infatuated each other during the fight. Love can bloom on a battlefield indeed! 😂  As Iwanted to keep things smooth and easy, I decided to apply a trick I hadrecently discovered, namely to skip Brawly’s Gym. My initial plan was to tackleit after Norman’s Gym, during that long swimming stretch between Petalburg andSlateport; but surprise surprise, I discovered that my deadbeat Dad won’tengage me if I don’t have four Gym Badges! How dare you make demands of me whenyou barely qualify as a father, old man? Anyway, as Mr. Briney was stilllounging in Slateport, I had to backtrack all the way there to sail to Dewford.After all these vexations, it was only fair that I made mincemeant of Brawly,before going at Daddy with a vengeance and mopping the Gym floor with him aswell.    Thistime, I wanna talk about my early move pool. My former Skitty Run reports mayhave given the impression that I went from zero to hero, but reality is morenuanced: I went through a subtle yet palpable increase in power over the firsthalf of the game, despite being unable to learn anything through levelling-up. BeatingWattson brought Shock Wave into my arsenal; and on my merry way to Fallarbor, Isnatched Secret Power on Route 111. Going through the normal evolution routefor Gen III Skitty (i.e. evolving after getting the Moon Stone in Meteor Falls)would add Faint Attack, Covet and maybe even Double Edge to that pool and makeit even more efficient and varied.   I won’texpand on the second half of my run, which was a complete one-shootingfestival; let’s jump straight to the elite Four showdown, and find out if theLucky Egg worked its magic! Let’s end the suspense here: alas, my kitty didn’thit the big 100. Not only that, but I had to rely on a bunch of Rare Candies tocrack the 90 mark! The Lucky Egg is awesome; yet Gen III is no Gen VI, and youstill have to fight every single Trainer in Hoenn to unlock your lone ranger’sfull potential.    Anyway,the Elite Four is always a cakewalk with a Delcatty armed with Thunderbolt,Shadow Ball, Ice Beam and Return. Sidney: one-shoot his whole team withsuper-effective Shadown Ball. Phoebe: one-shoot her whole team withsuper-effective Shadow Ball. Glacia: one-shoot her whole team with more thaneffective enough Return. Drake: one-shoot his whole team with super-effectiveIce Beam. Last but not least, our boy Steven: take down Skarmory withThunderbolt and Claydol with Shadow Ball, get rid of Aggron, Cradily andArmaldo with whatever works, and eradicate Metagross with Shadow Ball. And reapyour well-deserved laurels for cruising with the most unassumingly badasskitten of them all. Skitty is a true Gen III hidden gem, a ‘Mon that isdesigned to fit its turf perfectly and treat you to a delicious sense ofprogress as you scale Hoenn.    Skitty’sempowering prowess makes me wanna tackle a variety of Gen III challenge runs.Like, how about a Skitty run using only Double-Edge? Or an early move poolSkitty run? Let’s shelve these ideas for a more masochistic time, dear fellowgamers; and see you soon with more gaming goodness!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Ruby: The Delcatty Solo Run, part 1: Five days of kitty-ness", "date": "28/11/2023", "text": "I’mchanging my run report format for once, going for a day-to-day record of myrun’s highlights. Without further ado, let’s get started! Day 1: Bred a bunch ofSkittys in my Emerald cartridge, hatchedthe eggs to check Natures, reloaded save from a couple of minutes ago, andsent the fittest kitty of the bunch to my Rubycartridge — still comfily nested in her egg. A bit of running around later, Iwas the proud Trainer of Sakura, a lv.5Skitty with a Rash Nature; not very useful in the early stages, but bound to workmiracles in the late ones. Thanks to an extra trade, the Dawn Stone also landedin my inventory, ready to be used at will.   I reachedRustboro and Roxanne’s Gym with the crappiest Move pool — namely Tackle,Double Slap, Tail Whip and Attract. Attract was basically useless due toRoxanne’s ‘Mons being female, and Tail Whip was pointless due to said Mon’spropensity to use Defense Curl and Harden. I had to make do with Tackle andDouble Slap, as many X Attacks and X Defends I could purchase with my meagrefunds, a hefty dose of luck and the patience of a saint. Oh, and grinding, obviously; I didn’t even standa chance until lv.18.    Day 2: Sailed to DewfordTown to engage Brawly, who turned out to be nearly as tedious as Roxanne. Iknew this from my Skitty run and from basic Type matching, mind you; but playing it was actually a whole other canof worms. I was still levels away from Faint Attack, a Move that wouldn’t havechanged jack sh*t anyway as far as Brawly’s Fighting ‘Mons were concerned; andso, I threw in the towel and used the Dawn Stone on Sakura. That gave me thenecessary extra oomph to overcome Brawly, and I could sail unhindered towardsnew shores and easier Gyms.    Day 3: Blazed through Gymslike wildfire! Overlevelling did the trick at first, and then my awesomerevamped Move pool took over. I got Return right before Gym n°4 in Lavaridge, IceBeam after Gym n°5 in Petalburg City, Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball after Gym n°6in Fortree City — and the face of my run was changed forever. Once again, I knew what to expect from my Skitty run; butit’s always a blast to play it.    Day 4: Gyms n°7 and n°8were mere formalities thanks to Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball — awesome Move poolis awesome! I polished off Victory Road unhindered, and reached the PokemonLeague at lv.80. That wasn’t enough to my taste; so I ran around a bunch with asmall army of Zigzagoons to reap enough Rare Candies to reach the big 100. ThenI realized I had forgotten to pick up the Silk Scarf in Dewford Town; I made aquick detour to retrieve it, pondered if I should get a Spell Tag from Mt. Pyreas well, and decided to abstain.     Day 5: It’s show time, baby! I invested a smallfortune in Battle items before entering the arena — only to discover that Ididn’t need them after all. One clean hit was enough to get rid of mostopponents; and none of them required more than two hits to bite the dust. Whatabout Steven’s Metagross, I hear you say? Well, that was the most glorious andbeautiful run-wrapper of them all: Steven’s Metagross was sent home crying witha splendid critical hit. Glorious,I’m telling you!   My runclocked in at 12 hours, which is still a tad too long for my taste. Not only that,but I kinda soiled the experience by not letting my Sakura evolve right fromher first step out of the egg. Now I’m wondering: what if I tackled the samerun, only with a Delcatty armed with a Lucky Egg? How much could I shrink myrunning time? I’m totally gonna do just that, dear fellow gamers; and so, staytuned for the second part of that Delcatty solo run experience!"},
{"title": "Pokemon RSE & FRLG: Pimping my ride — a.k.a. the craziest epopee of them all", "date": "27/11/2023", "text": "Back in august 2018, I performed a Skitty solo run that turned out tobe one of my most pleasant and memorable Pokemonsolo runs of all time. The run itself was great, because it was smooth andfulfilling as heck; but the environment also played a part. I was holidaying ina dream spot, with no shortage of sun, vistas and lovely quiet afternoons spentplaying some Pokemon with home-brewedice tea by my side.  My lovelymemories of that Skitty runresurfaced that summer, making me feel all warm and mushy; and hot on the heels ofthat feeling came the desire to indulge in Ruby& Sapphire again. I didn’t have the same dream setting, sure; but Istill had home-brewed ice tea, and quiet late afternoons to play some Pokemon. Before I knew it, I wasplaying Ruby with abandon, blazingthrough Hoenn with a Delcatty at the helm — run report to come soon! Soundsrad, doesn’t it? Well, my initial plan was even radder than that. I’ve slowlybut surely learnt to appreciate Gen III’s merits over time: I dig the swiftpacing of RSE, the sheer grindinessof FRLG, and the refreshingsimplicity of both. Gen III’s entries are just perfect for short’n’sweet soloendeavours; and I wanted to refine that perfection by bringing the Lucky Egginto the fold. More like two Lucky Eggs, actually: one for my dedicated Emerald breeding cartridge, and anotherfor my dedicated LeafGreen breedingcartridge. Little did I know that this simple idea would turn into the mostconvoluted Pokemon epopee of themall; an epopee so impossibly long that it nearly qualifies as a full-blown run.   I was a bit miffed to learn that the Lucky Egg cannot be found anywhere in Hoenn; not only that, butthe sole way to get it in Gen III Kanto is through wild Chanseys, which have a5% chance of holding one. That sounds like a crappy rate; but do you knowwhat’s even crappier? Chansey’s location in FRLG,and its popping-up rate there. Super-elusive Chansey only roams the Safari Zone, with a 1% rate in theCentre Area and a 4% rate in Area 2. Gee, whiz, these are teeny-tiny numbers; Iwonder what are the probabilities involved! Well, I’ll tell ya: the probabilityof encountering a Chansey holding a Lucky Egg is 0,05% in the Centre Area, and0,2% in Area 2. And then, you have to actually capture the thing; I decided from the get-go to avoid baiting,which left me a 10% chance of catching Chansey. I don’t know how to calculatethe probability of catching a Chansey holding a Lucky Egg; but suffice it tosay that the chances are very, very slimindeed.  Do you think that made me falter? Heckno! I eagerly took up the gauntlet; I daresay I was even a bit thrilled,because I’m a sucker for ludicrous challenges like that — blame it on a uncanny blend of masochism and arrogance. A no lessuncanny amount of time later, I was the proud Trainer of not just one, but two Chanseys holding Lucky Eggs.    I thoughtthe deed was done; imagine then my dismay when I innocently tried to send oneChansey to my Emerald cartridge, onlyto be slapped in the face with a cryptic message claiming that trading withfaraway regions was not yet possible — period. The absence of any in-game hint in a2004 Pokemon entry supposed to enabletrade with older games from the same Gen is a pretty nasty move — but nevermind that, it’s 2023 and internet wisdom can get us out of such binds! Noamount of internet wisdom could save me from the hassle of actuallytaking the crap ton of required steps to enable Trade between RSE and FRLG — namely: —     Rack up atally of 60 caught ‘Mons so that I could get the National dex from ProfessorOak in Pallet Town. As far as my cartridge was concerned, that involved fishingand running around in various locations to get my paws on 20-or-socreatures.—     Sail toOne Island, talk to Celio at the Pokemon Network Centre, and retrieve the Rubyfrom Mt. Ember. —     Give theRuby to Celio, get a Rainbow Pass from him and sail to Four Island.—     Get intothe Icefall Cave at Four Island, retrieve HM07 Waterfall, reach the bottom ofthe cave and fight a bunch of Team Rocket grunts with Lorelei.—     Sail toSix Island and enter the Dotted Hole by using Cut on the door. Retrieve theSapphire from the depth of the cave — only to have it taken from you by TeamRocket scientist Gideon.—     Sail toFive Island, scour the Team Rocket hideout and whoop Gideon’s arse.—     Give theretrieved Sapphire to Celio in One Island. I’mexhausted just writing this, seriously! But the deed is done now, and I can send my Chansey and her uber-precious LuckyEgg to Emerald. Not only that, but Ialso unlocked the Day Care in the process; and you can bet your sweet life I’mgonna take up residence on Four Island and breed lone rangers like it’s goingout of fashion. Stay tuned for Gen III run reports, dear fellow gamers — andtake care!"},
{"title": "Etrian Odyssey III: One step forward, two steps back", "date": "26/11/2023", "text": "“7 hours,34 minutes and 50 seconds; 12th floor barely reached — and I’mcalling it quits.EOIII is not horrendous; but as the title implies, it’s not quite as goodas EOII. The latter’s strata themes clicked with me in the most effortless way; EOIII’s stratathemes, on the other hand, feel a bit off — and clearly underexploited. Forinstance: despite being an absolute sucker for marine depths, I felt absolutelynothing when roaming the Undersea Grotto. No sweet wanderlust, nosoothing immersion; that stratum felt more like a papier mâché décor than likea real ocean floor.” This iswhat I initially wrote, and it was perfectly true at the time; in fact, I still stand by it regarding the subpar execution of the strata themes. The part aboutquitting, though, is outdated; for lo and behold, I dove back into EOIIIwith a vengeance and finished it in one fell swoop!    The firstorder of business was to extract myself from the maddeningly labyrinthineUndersea Grotto. I found myself stuck because of some currents, and quicklyreasoned that I was facing a headache — in every sense of the word — similar tothe Elevator situation in EOI’s fifth stratum. Being a wise gamer honedby decades of gaming the way a fine blade would be, I knew obstinacy was asvain as it was futile; and thus, I quickly ran to the internet and let thewisdom of other fellow gamers enlighten me! The way out of that darn secondstratum proved ridiculously arcane and convoluted — like, ‘80sPoint-and-Clickers levels of convolution. But nevermind, I got myself out thismess and could soar ahead — as much as one could soar in a subterraneanlabyrinth, anyway.   Yeah,about that: after the liberation of climbing of a giant tree in EOII,we’re back to the oppression of diving into an abyss. This is alreadygalling enough for claustrophobic little me; to make matters worse, the marinesetting and the Deep City stop reminded me unpleasantly of Made in Abyss— and I just DON'T wanna think about Made in Abyss, EVER. Erm, anyway!Another thing I mourn from the awesome EOII are the no less awesome one-wayGeomagnetic Poles, which were present every two or three floors and enabled directteleportation from town to the given floor once activated.  Back to the strata: theMolten Caves were as graphically dull as any other lava level from any othergame; as for the Abyssal Shrine, it was so unremarkable that I genuinely cannotremember what it looks like as I’m writing this. However, they were bothstimulating to crawl, and they single-handedly rekindled my interest in thegame. Then came the true jewel in the crown, a.k.a. Porcelain Forest. Gosh, theperfection! Splendid crystalline graphics, epic “the end is night” music,clever and challenging gimmicks: all this made for delightful crawling, and avery happy little me. Then came the pre-final boss — namely the Automaton Kingand Olympia, as I had chosen the Armoroad Route. Disposing of them was a matterof a couple of turns and minutes… and led me straight to the credits roll,leaving me gaping at the screen and thinking “wait, is it already over? Justlike that?” Not gonna lie, that ending was kinda… anticlimactic. Sure enough,the Cyclopean Haunt was there for the crawling after the credits; however, thatqualifies as postgame to me, and I don’t do postgame.    I rank EOIIIhalfway between EOII and EOI. The second entry remains my absolutefavourite of the original trilogy; however; I can see myself replaying thethird — and not just for the sake of clearing all endings and getting more of thestrata I liked. The weapon system, for one, was a real treat: not only werethere more weapons available than in both EOI and EOII combined —both in terms of types and volume — but characters could also equip a varietyof weapons instead of being stuck with a mere one or two types. This made forinteresting variations in fighting dynamics, especially once the Class systemwas factored in — a.k.a. the game’s second saving grace as far as I’mconcerned.    Here'show it goes between me and class systems in RPGs: I hate single-class systemsbecause they’re too darn restrictive for no good reason, but I lovedouble-class systems because they allow for endless permutations. As youguessed already, EOIII’s class system belongs to the latter variety —and gosh, was it an absolute treat! My party became a roaring force of rampageas soon as the second class became available, and the enjoyment I derived fromthe game skyrocketed. So did my crawling speed:I polished off the three remaining strata in a puny five hours, making my runclock in at 12 hours, 20 minutes and 14 seconds.    At anyrate, one thing is abundantly clear: as far as the original EO trilogyis concerned, the Origins Collection is the real deal for me. I can thus partwith the DS original games and 3DS remakes without a care in the world! I’dnever thought the Switch would come to host so many past glories and hiddengems, bringing them to a wider audience; but that’s a development I’m more thanhappy about, and I’ll be the first to celebrate it. We need more games fromgenerations past on the Switch, yes please!"},
{"title": "Dragon Prana: Here we go again", "date": "25/11/2023", "text": "You mightthink Dragon Prana is related to (the awesome) Dragon Sinker, andyou’d be totally right. While not being a direct sequel to Sinker, Pranais a spiritual successor of sorts starring a crap ton of similar features —from the game world to the ever-squabbling four fantasy races, from the sheergrindiness to the breaking glass animation of vanquished foes in battle,without forgetting that delightful fat pixel-y art style. Oh, and the titulardraconic baddie.    Still, Pranais not a pure copy-paste: think of it more as a fancier, more elaboratedversion of Sinker. The map is much larger and features more variedlocales, the side quests are more abundant, and the story is significantlymeatier. Last but not least, there is a crap ton of character development andassociated dialogues. Sinker had this slightly humorous thing going onbetween party members: they squabbled at first, yet learnt to respect and likeeach other over time, with a bit of tsundere antics in-between. but Pranatakes it to a whole new level — a level so high that dialogue actually becameoverbearing and intrusive after a while. I never thought I’d have to skipdialogues in a Kemco RPG; and yet I did towards the end, because I justwanted to kick the big baddie’s arse and was tired of reading about fantasyrace politics and formerly intolerant NPCs turning over a new leaf.     Now,would I recommend Prana over Sinker? Nope, because each part ofthat dyad will scratch a different itch. While I was initially disappointedthat Prana was not an exact copy-paste of Sinker, I realised nowthat it needn’t be. Sinker exists already, and I can replay it at willif I want a straightforward grindy treat; should I want a no less grindy butlushier and swisher treat, I can roll with Prana. I'll see you soon with more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers; until next time, take care!   Lagaarddone and dusted! My run clocked at 12 hours, and was infinitely more satisfyingthan my EOI run. The reason could be summed up in one word: refinement.Every feature at work in EOI was polished and honed in EOII,creating a game that improves on its predecessor on virtually all fronts.    As Icrawled in Picnic mode again, my main focus was exploration and dungeonlayouts. I can safely claim that EOII fares much better than its prequelon that front — although it’s hard to pinpoint exactly how and why. I’d saythat the overall dungeon design is smoother and more intuitive, so tospeak; it feels more organic, less contrived than in EOI. Sure, you findthe exact same dungeon features as in EOI — conveyor belts, shortcutsthrough walls, floating platforms, you name it — but they’re much better implemented.My roaming time should be abundant proof of that betterment in on the dungeondesign front: I polished off the whole labyrinth, final boss et al., in a mere12 hours; in comparison, I needed 14 hours to reach EOI’s 24thfloor, while knowing a good part of the labyrinth from before.   On apersonal note, I dug Lagaard way more than Etria. First, the notion ofascending a giant tree rather than diving into an abyss was more pleasant;secondly, the strata’s themes sat better with me. I was immensely fond of theFrozen Grounds because winter, and Petal Bridge was nicely unexpected —I’ve not encountered a Sakura blossom-themed dungeon since Touhou GensoWanderer. The final dungeon, Heavenly Keeps, was a bit lacking on thevisual front; however, it made up for it by offering clever floor designs.Really, my only pet peeve with EOII’s dungeons is the infuriatingoccurrence of harmful dungeon events. Dungeon events in EOI were few andfar between, and as likely to be positive as negative; they’re at every cornerin EOII, and way more likely to produce bad outcomes. After my preciousAriadne Thread was taken from me three times (insert murderous eyes) insuch dungeon events, I learnt my lesson and avoided them like the plague forthe rest of my run.      Dungeon events aside, that run was a grindy monument of crawling perfection. The second it was over, I launched Etrian Odyssey III and dove into it with the dopamine-fueled enthusiam of a gamer who just finished a glorious run. I expected EOIII to be just as good, if not even better, than EOII; but was it? Let's find out in my EOIII report, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: A Random Save File", "date": "24/11/2023", "text": "Followingthe New 2DS XL stealing debacle, I set out to purchase another copy of PokemonY. It so happened that my usual game store has a second-hand copy in stock,which I eagerly secured and proceeded to play immediately; but before that, Iwas treated to that most wondrous experience of discovering the resident savefile. You know what I’m talking about, dear fellow gamers: that sneak peek at astranger’s gaming intimacy, which makes you feel like a voyeur and a detective.It’s exciting, troubling, and even slightly disturbing at times, but it’salways interesting.   Myfreshly bought Y cartridge was not freshly played, that’s forsure. It hosted the save file of a certain ‘Miranda’, who started playing onthe 20th of January 2017. Miranda hadn’t progressed much in thegame, as they had barely reached Route 6 and still had to retrieve the PokéFlute from Parfum Palace. Pretty standard fare, shall I say; what wasconsiderably less standard, not to say kinda uncanny, was Miranda’s party.  See,Miranda’s roster was made of a single Mon; but not just any Mon. We’re talkingabout a Lv. 23 Wingull called Wendy, which wielded Fly, Water Pulse, Roost andBrine. Such a setup would be impossible at that point in the game, so that birdwas obviously traded from another cartridge. Wendy’s data page confirmed thatshe had hatched on the 27th of November 2016, i.e. a good two monthsbefore Miranda started playing. Also, Wendy was visibly traded as a hatchedWingull: the data page mentioned that her egg was received from a Day-CareCouple, and that she hatched on Route 7 — places Miranda has yet to reach afterdisposing of Snorlax.   One canonly speculate about Miranda’s goal for creating such a setup — and quittingplaying so early on. The most likely explanation is that they attempted aWingull/Pelipper solo run, and slapped powerful moves on Wendy before tradingit just to get an easy ride; alas, her performance was less stellar thanexpected, and Miranda lost steam and quit. (I should know, because the exactsame thing happened to me with Goomy.) Anyway, I spared a though for Miranda andtheir aborted Y run as I deleted their save file to make room for mine. Runscome and go, and so do games and pieces of kit — but that’s a story for anotherpost, folks!"},
{"title": "Etrian Odyssey I: Still crappy after all these years", "date": "23/11/2023", "text": "Way backin early 2018, I performed a solo run of the original EO. The wholeendeavour was as exhilarating as it was torturous; it eventually turned plain tedious, and I finally threw in the towel atthe end of the 4th Stratum. In myfinal post, I wrote that sentence: \"EO is like that new pal you meet and click instantly with, thinking you're gonna be mates forever — only to realize after a few weeks that they're a bit of a prick after all.\" That description was pitch-perfect back then; but does itapply to the ‘Origins’ version of EO? It pains me to say that, but itstill kinda applies.   Thingsstarted auspiciously enough, thanks to the combination of Picnic difficulty anda five-member crew. I could progress at breakneck speed, beyond my wildestexpectations: while my initial aborted run clocked at 70-or-so hours, that newrun lasted a puny 14 hours. Now we’re talking, game! Despite these good points,I didn’t finish my run, calling it quits right before the 25thand final floor. I couldn’t figure out how to access said final floor, and Ididn’t care enough about the game to keep trying to figure it out.   Anotherthing I wrote in my parting post with the original EO was \"stupidly hard for the sheer sake of being stupidly hard\". And well, my experience with the Origins version onlyconfirms that statement. Once EO’s sadistic difficulty is removed, youfully realise how utterly uninspired the labyrinth layouts are; these floorsare not designed to give you an exploration kick, but rather to accommodatestealth sessions where you play hide-and-seek with FOES.  Actually,the whole game’s balance is structured around its tough-as-nails difficultylevel; remove that difficulty, and nearly everything falls apart. Classes andteam balancing become meaningless because FOES bit the dust in a couple ofturns, and everything else in one turn. The precarious money balance issuevirtually disappears, as you always have enough to get the best gear available.Last but not least, the whole thrill of overcoming seemingly impossiblechallenges evaporates entirely as everything submits to your will. Still,I don’t think it was a mistake to introduce more forgiving difficulty modes:the original experience is still very much alive for the masochists amongst us,and people who want an easier ride can now partake in the fun as well.   I feelI’ve given the original EO its fair chance to shine. It turns out thatthis game and I aren’t meant together: even on Picnic mode, it remains a bit ofa frustrating experience that’s definitely not on par other favourite FPDCs ofmine. That’s not to say that subsequent entries won’t please me, though; as amatter of fact, I dove into EO II hot on the heels of dropping EO I.Stay tuned for the upcoming run report, dear fellow gamers!"},

Sure, I failed to clear the first instalment and haven’t touched the second and the third, and I own all of themalready on the DS; but the prospect of enjoying the initial trilogy on mybeloved Switch Lite was just too alluring. Just a couple o’ extra ports andremakes, and I can ditch all 7th generation systems without regret —but hey, that’s a story for another post ^^  Anyway, Originsbrought more than a visual revamping of the DS original games and a couple ofnew character models. We’re talking quality-of-play improvements, folks: stufflike being able to tweak battle and animation speed, or being offered threelevels of difficulty right off the bat. Let me tell ya, dear fellow gamers:I’ve taken up enough gaming gauntlets to be able to relax now. And so, Iproudly rolled with the ‘Picnic’ difficulty — and with a full five-rangers crewwhile I was at it, because I wouldn’t tackle a solo run of EO again even if mylife depended on it.   But wait;I’m getting kinda ahead of myself here! The plan was simple: as soon as I gotmy greedy paws on my copy of Origins, I was going to play it withabandon. I went as far as to preorder the thing from Play-Asia, and I fullyexpected to be lost in the labyrinths by the end of June; however, my orderwasn’t due to be sent before July due to production delays regarding othergames I had ordered at the same time. Then I had to cancel my order and placeit again due to other reasons; when Origins arrived somewhere at thebeginning of August, the Pokemon Summer Season was in full swingand capturing all my gaming attention. Fast-forward to late September: as Ifinally polished my last Pokemon run of the summer, I was finally readyto give Origins the attention it deserved.    Nomystery here: if I have the strength to do so, I’m gonna play all three gamesback-to-back. I just need ample amounts of intense grinding &crawling these days, and Etrian Odyssey is the perfect series to scratchthat itch. I wanna explore and fight until I feel lightheaded and slightlydelirious — so give it to me, baby!

{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Male Meowstic solo run (redux)", "date": "21/11/2023", "text": "Well,look who got another serving of Gen VI! After polishing off a run withFemale Meowstic, cruising — again — with Male Meowstic felt like the naturalthing to do. A bit of breeding later, I was in possession of an Egg hosting aMale Meowstic with a Lonely Nature, which I deemed perfect for the deed. Fromwhat I remembered, Male Meowstic’s learnset was way shallower than his femalecounterpart’s; and thus I needed to make the most of every single move it couldlearn, including Physical moves.    One tradelater, I was blazing through Kalos with my Chat-nel — no need to changesuch an awesome name! As for the word ‘blazing’, I used it intentionally. MyChat-nel was already able to one-shoot the opposition by the time we reachedSantalune City; this has become a delicious pattern in my X&Y runs,and it’s all thanks to what I dubbed the Boost XP Combo. See, I’ve refined my X&Ypower routine to perfection by not only sending a Lucky Egg along the Egg dujour, but also by raising my newly hatched Mon’s affection in Pokemon Amieto two hearts before even setting foot in Viridian Forest. I can thus reap themaximum amount of sweet XP right from the start, which leads to stellar results— like, Grant is still the b*tch and first real roadblock he’s supposed to be,but he hurts way less than he should.   Talkingabout Grant, I fought him as a fully evolved Lv. 30-or-so Meowstic. I hadlearnt Light Screen earlier, planning to keep it precisely for Grant — or, tobe painfully precise, for his Amaura’s deadly Aurora Beam. But when Psyshockrolled in, I questioned the logic of keeping a move slot occupied for a movethat would literally be useful a single time — and maybe not even necessary tobegin with, dang it! Being the hothead I am, I finally ditched Light Screen;and that’s how I ended up in front of Grant with Psybeam, Psyshock, DisarmingVoice and Return. Not too shabby, methinks! Now, was this the right decision? Youbet, b*tch! Amaura opened with Thunder Wave, Take Down and Rock Tomb, whichleft me ample room to use my two X Sp.Atk and heal from paralysis. I never gotto know if Amaura would have used the dreaded Aurora Beam on the fourth turn,because I one-shot it with Psyshock. Poor Tyrunt didn’t get to use a singlemove, biting the dust after another deadly Psyshock.   I gavemale Chat-nel the same Pokemon Amie pampering as his female counterpart, goingall the way to BFF forever. I also managed to go all the way in the mini-gamesrankings, scoring Five Stars in Head It’s Unlimited Mode for the first time ever;following that prowess, I was treated to some extra-fancy ‘Supreme’ Poké Puffs!I’ve been playing X&Y for nine years, and I still discover quirksand hidden features to this day, to my utter delight.   My mightyplan of making Chat-nel a mixed attacker didn’t come to fruition. Despite hisLonely Nature, his Attack was always substantially lower than his Sp. Attack;and as Male Meowstic can learn the exact same TMs as Female Meowstic, I decidedto go full Special. Also, I thought for some reason that Male and FemaleMeowstic had different stat distribution, with the former leaning on thedefensive side and the latter on the offensive side; however, they have the exactsame stats. Turn out that the only real difference between them, apart fromlooks, is their levelling-up learnset; this makes the line far more malleablethan you’d think — and that’s how I could end up facing the Elite Four with aSp. Attack cracking the 200 ceiling.   As theFemale Meowstic showdown was still fresh in my mind and in my gamers’ pride, Idecided I had nothing left to prove and was going to take it easy this timearound. ‘Easy’ meant using the Zap Plate and the Meadow Plate to face Malva andSiebold respectively, gobbling a couple of X Sp. Attacks against Drasna,Wikstrom and Diantha, and muching on Leftovers between each turn. This was acakewalk, and I was crowned Champion after 11 hours of delightfulKalos-cruising.   Althoughthe summer is not completely over yet as I’m writing this (edit: in early september), I’m done with X&Yfor the time being! Other games are tickling my fancy, and I must heed the call ofthe gaming instinct. Take care and see you next time, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Pokemon X: The Female Meowstic solo run (redux)", "date": "20/11/2023", "text": "After the summer’s many false starts, I was going to take my sweet time enjoying Kalos.Leisurely exploring locations I usually rush through, such as Viridian Forestand the Battle Chateau? Check! Strolling around in Lumiose and changing myTrainer’s outfit every playing session? Check! Scouring the Kaloswilderness to collect TMs I usually never bother getting? Check! Raising my Oneand Monly's affections in Pokemon Amie until we’re BFF? Check!   Beforeindulging in all these delicacies, I had to breed the perfect Meowstic. Icouldn’t leave things to chance this time around, given that I specificallyneeded a female feline; and I was going to pick the best combination of natureand ability while I was at it. The lucky winner was a Mild female Meowstic withthe Infiltrator ability. Keen Eye is great overall; but Infiltrator is bettersuited for a Mild Mon, as it means that Light Screen won’t do jack sh*t inbattle. Cherry on the cake, the hidden ability Competitive would neatlycompensate renouncing Keen Eye, as any stat reduction would boost my Sp.Attack. With such a combination, I had no qualms about going full Special withmy Chat-nel. I’m uber-proud of that name, en passant: it’s a pun on Chaneland the word chat, which means ‘cat’ in French and is pronounced thesame way as the cha- in Chanel.   By theend of my run, the gap between my Attack and Sp. Attack was a whopping 103,with the latter peaking at a no less whopping 245. It should surprise no one tolearn that after an early run spent wielding Disarming Voice, Psybeam, Psyshockand Return, I ditched them all in favour of more powerful and varied SpecialMoves. Said Moves were Extrasensory, Shadow Ball, Thunderbolt and Signal Beam,which I gleefully spammed during the second half of my run. I revamped thatcombo right before the Elite Four showdown: I replaced Signal Beam,Extrasensory and Shadow Ball with Energy Ball, Dark Pulse and Psychic, and usedall my PP Ups on these moves.   Myinitial plan involved running with Espurr for as long as I could; in practice,“as long as I could” meant Grant’s Gym in Cyllage City. I was Lv. 30 when Ifaced him, and his darn duo of Fossils gave me trouble. After a couple offailed attempts, I suddenly got pissed; I fed my feline a Rare Candy I had instock, went at Grant with a vengeance, and mopped the Gym floor with his nowpowerless Fossils.   My runafter I crossed that evolutionary Rubicon was pretty much a one-shootingfestival. Although the Elite Four never posed a real threat given Chat-nel’slevel and stats, they offered me a wide and interesting range of Type coveragesituations. I had virtually no super-effective Move against Drasna’s dragons,bar Psychic that made short work of her Dragalge; on the other hand, I had theluxury of choosing between super-effective Energy Ball and Super-effectiveThunderbolt to dispose of Siebold’s marine creatures. Lounging in the middlewas Malva, whose fiery crew I destroyed with normally effective Psychic.Wikstrom provided the smoothest and slickest fight of them all, a fight thatgave me the feeling of being a master strategist:  —     Klefi: I opened with Psychic, which was a major mistake as Klefki resiststhat very type. It survived the first hit, and was able to use Torment againstme before going down with a second Psychic. I was ready to reset, but I finallydecided to forge ahead and see if I could turn the tables. —     Scizor: One-shooting with normally effective Thunderbolt.—     Aegislash: I used Energy Ball on the first turn, while it was still in ShieldForme. That paved the way for a serving of super-effective Dark Pulse on thesecond turn, while Aegislah was in Blade Forme and thus more vulnerable. —     Probopass: Two-shooting with normally effective Thunderbolt, once Wikstromwas done spending all his Full Restores.  Then cameDiantha: after using a X Sp. Atk on the first turn just in case, I took downHawlucha with Psychic, and Tyrantrum and Aurorus with Energy Ball. Then Dark Pulsemade short work of Gourgeist, Goodra and Mega Gardevoir, putting a glorious end to myrun just shy of 11 hours.  Longstory short: Female Meowstic is just as badass as I remembered, and I finallymanaged to get my yearly dose of summer Gen VI fun.

{"title": "Pokemon X&Y: A rocky Summer 2023 Season", "date": "19/11/2023", "text": "Let me set the scene, dear fellow gamers: Augustwas coming to an end, and I still hadn’t polished off a single run of X&Y.Was I suddenly not in the mood to indulge in that beloved summer habit of mine?Oh yes, I was most definitely in the mood, and I did try to get myself some X&Y;but bad luck, destiny, the Universe, whatever, conspired to spoil these runs.Time to bring in the popcorn and listen to my X&Y woes, dear fellowgamers!  I firststarted a Honedge solo run in Pokemon Y, way back in July. Cruising inKalos again was as delightful and heart-warming as ever, and Honedge proved tobe a stellar lone ranger. I was on my merry way to the fourth Gym, when theunthinkable happened and doom crashed upon me. Picture this: as I exited thelocal post office with a parcel, I needed to rearrange the contents to my bagto fit said parcel. My black&blue New 2DS XL was part of my bag’s contents;I put it on the side along other stuff, and shove everything back in the bagwith the parcel — or so I though. Because, lo and behold, I actually forgot myprecious New 2DS XL on the curb. That fateful moment of inattention was boundto have dire consequences: by the time I realised what I had done and hastilybacktracked, Paris had already swallowed my piece of kit!   That fauxpas was costly, let me tell you. Not only did I lose a great save file starringa great ‘Mon, but I also lost my Y cartridge, my black&blue New 2DSXL, its matching pouch, and the UltraSun and Aqua Sapphire cartridgesthat were tucked in said pouch. Most of this can be purchased again; as for myHonedge run, it can obviously be tackled again. Still, that event put a dent inmy desire to play X&Y; I decided a brain refresher was in order, andturned to Gen III (more on that in upcoming posts).  Afterpolishing off two back-to-back Delcatty runs of Ruby and Sapphire,the time was ripe to play some X&Y again. For that second try of thesummer, I decided to cruise with local dragon Goodra, a ‘Mon I had been curiousabout for the longest time. Goodra being a pseudo-legendary and a Dragon typeto boot, I expected some epic fighting prowess from the whole line; however,Goomy sorely failed on that front, and routinely failed to one-shoot theopposition. As I reached Cyllage City, I started to worry: my Lv.25 Goomy gotutterly destroyed by Fisherman Shad’s Lv.20 Shellder, and I struggled mightilyagainst the Gym Trainers. Then came Grant, whose lv.25 Amaura usedsuper-effective Aurora Beam on the first turn. My Goomy got obliterated— along with any illusion of smooth progress. Being able to face Amaura wouldhave required insane amounts of grinding, luck and strategizing; all things Iwas not in the mood for.   Thatevent allowed me to realise that I wanted a slick and smooth run, which wouldallow me to blaze through Kalos effortlessly. I also wanted some Frenchness,somehow; as I was spending the whole summer in Paris, I wanted to bathe in allthings French, and crank the French Cliché meter to eleven. And then came theepiphany: I was going to cruise again with female Meowstic, a.k.a. themost badass yet Chanel-esque feline of them all, the perfect mix ofclass&grit. That run led to other runs; needless to say, I wrote run reports for them all, which I'll post here in the next days. Stay tuned! ^^"},

{"title": "Boxxle: A lifelong obsession that needn't be", "date": "06/08/2023", "text": "As I’mstruggling on Boxxle’s 59thpuzzle (out of 100), the time is ripe to take a break from the game — and writea post while I’m at it!  Boxxle came to Europe in1990; it was part of the very first batch of games released alongside theshiny, brand-new Game Boy, and I remember seeing some screen captures in paperads. Just like basically any screen capture from early Game Boy titles, thesenuggets of gameplay became deeply embedded in my young gamer’s mind, andhaunted me for decades to come.   The thingis: despite being eager to play that game at the time, I never managed to getmy paws on it — until one month ago, that is. A lack of funds are probably toblame for my not purchasing Boxxleback in 1990, mixed with potential unavailability in local shops. I tried toget my paws on it later, to no avail. This time, lack of funds orunavailability were not to blame; this was entirely my memory’s fault. See, Iremembered the game’s name as Boxedinstead of Boxxle; and that confusionprevented me from locating copies for years. Only recently did I manage touncover that mistake and secure a copy, as my drive to play that game suddenlypeaked for reasons known by my gaming instinct only.  You mightthink that I’m writing an awful lot about my history with that game, and thatI’m trying to avoid talking about the gameplay; and you’d be totally right. Boxxle’s gameplay is really not thatinteresting to write about, and it’s only marginally more interesting to play. Completing a puzzle in Boxxle implies moving boxes around in aprecise order; the sequence of events is crucial, as puzzles allow only alimited number of move combinations. There is no ‘eureka’ moment in Boxxle; just careful observation,patient strategizing and endless trial-and-error.  Thatdeliberate puzzle-solving is pleasant and soothing in the early stages, butturns frustrating as the game progresses. Puzzles become bigger and morecomplex around the 40 mark; trial-and-error then turns to a slog, as you haveto restart from scratch every time to try every combination you can think of. Boxxle would really benefit from a‘rewind’ system, which one could activate by using points gained through puzzlecompletion — à la Free to Play. Butalas, these were the early 90’s, and a gamer’s precious time was not valuedyet. And believe me when I say Boxxleis HARD. Forget about going the whole 100 in an evening; you will spend days,maybe even weeks, toiling on these puzzles.  Boxxle’s only savinggrace, and the sole reason I managed to go that far, is the convenientpossibility to access batches of ten puzzles at once through the Passkeysystem. Should you be desperately stuck on one puzzle, you can always move onthe next, or the one after that, until you’ve polished off the whole set.Interestingly, Boxxle’s gameplay isway too deliberate and complex to induce the famous Tetris effect; on the other hand, it’s also too messy and scatteredto induce some out-of-game obsessive strategizing.  Longstory short: Boxxle is really just aslow, hard, not exactly thrilling puzzle game that I may or may not finish overtime. I’m glad I could play it at last, though; not only could I scratch anitch from a distant past, but I had some genuine moments of fun with somepuzzles. Until my next pick, keep doing your think and take care, dear fellowgamers!"},
{"title": "Blacksmith of the Sand Kingdom: A digest", "date": "02/08/2023", "text": "We’redealing with an Atelier-lite Kemco RPG, which you can get physicalcourtesy of Limited Run Games. Now, unlike other LRG releases of Kemco stuff, BotSKcomes alone on its cartridge; this means that you have to forkout 40 bucks or more to get your paws on a Kemco budget RPG. I freakin’ loveKemco budget RPGs, and I’m sure I’m not the only one; still, aless-than-hardcore collector may balk at the thought of investing that much insuch a game. That’s where I step in: by kindly telling you what to expect (ornot) from BotSK, I’ll help you decide if it’s worth a purchase. Don’tthank me, I’m kind like that! ^^  SecureBlacksmith of the Sand Kingdom if: — Youdig old-school RPG tropes. Palette swaps from the second dungeon to thelast? Check! Gear progression that goes from iron pieces of kit toorichalcum ones, without forgetting gold and good ole mithril? Check!Vertiginous difficulty spikes at the beginning of each dungeon? Check!   — Youreally love grinding. Like, really freaking love it. Believe me when I saythat despite the word ‘blacksmith’ in the title, that game is 75% fighting.  — Youenjoy repetitive gameplay. BotSK features two main gameplay loops: thein-game day loop and the dungeon loop. The former is bound to repeat itself anuncanny number of times, and way too much to count at any rate; as for thelatter, you’ll have to clear it ten times in a row if you wanna finish thegame.   — Youlike navigating menus — or at least don’t mind it too much. A significantpart of BotSK’s gameplay involves going back and forth between somewhatarid-looking menus. When I say “significant”, I really truly mean that youcannot dispense with it, and that it will happen much more often, and forlonger, than you’d wish.     Steerclear of Blacksmith of the Sand Kingdom if:  — Youwant some solid and complex crafting. There is not a shred of strategizing,talent or even depth involved in BotSK’s brand of crafting. You cannotfail whatsoever, and arcane features such as item quality and traits arecompletely absent. Heck, you’re not even treated to close-ups of the many itemsyou forge! Also, forget about grids: blacksmithing is just a matter of navigatingmenus and pressing the A button. Were you maybe expecting a QTA or a minigame ofsorts in the forge? No such luck baby, we’re dealing with a Kemco RPG!   — Youwant a solid story. Or a story, full stop. Narrative is at its barest here— so much so that Asdivine Hearts feels like a full-blown epic incomparison. The ending is kinda nice; but it’s certainly not worthtoiling through 35 hours of grinding, dungeon crawling and menu navigating.   — Youwant fancy graphics and imaginative dungeon layouts. BotSK’sdrably coloured and poorly designed dungeons are really just an excuse to forageand fight; in fact, I’m pretty sure Rideon Inc. would have implementedmenu-based foraging and fighting, if not for the fact that the whole game wouldhave become a giant menu navigation fest in the process. I’m pretty toleranttowards shitty dungeon design; but even I have to admit that BotSK’sdungeons kinda suck.   — Youwant a quick ride. Kemco RPGs are short as a rule, and you’d be forgivenfor assuming that polishing off BotSK will a swift affair; but as itturns out, that particular Kemco RPG is on the long-winded side. I didn’t wantto believe internet wisdom, which claimed that 30 to 40 hours were required fora full run; but after spending a whopping 35 hours on my own run, I can safelytell you that 30 hours is a minimum indeed.   Well,that covers it! In a nutshell: Blacksmith of the Sand Kingdom is asimple and forgiving, if somewhat repetitive, take on the Atelierformula. Just like every Kemco RPG, it’s perfect to scratch a retro itch andprovide some stress-free gameplay. Until next time, take care andkeep doing your thing, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Harvestella: The end is here", "date": "30/07/2023", "text": "After 85 hours of play, I’m done with Squeenix’ take on thefarming-meets-RPG genre. I was barely starting to feel a bit of gaming fatigue;I could probably have gone on, had I not reached the ending and experienced theusual concomitant drop of will to play.   The money balance got better in the late stages, to my utter delight;and it would probably have gotten even better over time. From what I’ve seen,it follows an somewhat exponential progression: the early stages are unbearablyhard and slow, but money starts to roll in after certain steps are taken, andkeeps rolling faster and faster.    As far as I’m concerned, the turnaround happened after I cleared theAstrum Helix Research Facility. I harvested a lot of Promised Fruit Saplingsfrom foes and foraging spots and could create a big fat orchard. PromisedFruits can be harvested every other day and all year round, which allowed me toproduce a crap ton of jams and get plenty of decent money by sellingthem. I invested in pens, woolums and cluffowls; the latter produced milk andeggs on a daily basis, which I transformed and sold. I bought more saplings,woolums and cluffowls with my earnings, produced more transformed goods, andreaped more money; and I could easily have kept that loop going, earning alwaysmore and cramming my farm to max capacity.   Long story short: Harvestellais not a perfect game by any means, but it’s a game that I really enjoyed. It’sgorgeous as heck, and it offers a unique ethereal atmosphere and a slow pacingthat’s deeply soothing. And now, on to the next one!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Engage: I love it, but not right now", "date": "25/07/2023", "text": "The titleis self-explanatory, I guess. I really like everything about Engage, from the colourful cast to theno less colourful character design; and don’t even get me started on theinventive battlefields or the many player-friendly innovations. Yet despite allthat love, I don’t feel like indulging in Engageright now.   The thingis, this is not a game you can drop for days, lest you forget everything aboutyour crew; yet at the same time, it’s not exactly conducive to binge-playing. Iguess a good way to enjoy it would be to play one battle a day, plus a bit offluff; alas, this is not a play style I can pull off right now. And so, I haveto shelve Engage until I can give itthe time and attention it deserves.    I have tothank Engage for introducing me tothe wonderful Mika Pikazo and her eye-popping art, which I instantly became asucker for. I went as far as to purchase the Divine Edition and pin theincluded poster in my office — yeah, we’re cool like that where I work.   Anyway! Engage is not my jam now, but I’ll playit sooner or later, that’s for sure. And now, on to the next one!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Engage: Now we’re talking", "date": "22/07/2023", "text": "Well, guess who just reached chapter 11? Looks like I managed to make Engagework for me, baby! It took a full restart and a new run, but that was worth it.The best part is that this change of fortunes only took minor changes — namely:  — Storybattles only: During my first run, I tackled all extra battles and spent alot of time doing stuff in the Somniel; as a result, I lost my focus andhad trouble focusing on the main battles. For my second run, I decided to shearall that fluff and to zero in on said main battles — and that worked miracles!Not only do I enjoy the ride way more, but I also perform way better in battle.Win-win!  — Matchmakinggalore: You can play Fire Emblem without pairing units, but whywould you? Making love bloom on the battlefield is fun as heck, and I enjoy Engagemore now that I'm keeping my eyes peeled for potential chemistry. Alear istotally going to end up with Alcryst, just because I say so; I’ve not yetdecided for the rest of the roster, but that will come soon enough.   — Myfavourite units: During my first run, I felt compelled to keep units Ididn’t fancy in my force, just because they were strong or story-relevant. Thatwas obviously a bad move; this time around, I decided to focus on my veryfavourite units. Engage introduces a lot of units over a short period oftime, which forced me to choose very quickly; as of chapter 11, my main forcecomprises Alcryst, Framme, Clanne, Vander, Alfred, Etie, Diamant, Jade andLapis. The last three potentially have their heads on the chopping block, as Imay remove them for fancier units; the rest of the team should be assured tostay until the very end, unless they start sucking spectacularly on thebattlefield.    Thatsecond run feels effortless, and much more fulfilling than the first: not onlydid I reach Chapter 11 after a mere 3:38 hours of play, but battles flowsmoothly and painlessly. Talking about battles, I found a nifty way to dealwith being outnumbered as a rule: instead of scattering my units, I keep them clumpedand end my own turn early, thus letting foes come to me. It’s a bit cheap, but itworks great! That trick wouldn’t cut it with perma-death on, as I lose a coupleof units still every battle; but it’s perfect for casual play. I’ll see yousoon with a proper progress report, dear fellow gamers! Take care!"},
{"title": "Harvestella: Playing it like there’s no other game waiting", "date": "12/07/2023", "text": "As I’m reaching the 60-hours mark and the end of chapter 6 (out of 9),I feel the time has come to sit down and commit my Harvestellaimpressions to paper. But first, you may wonder: why am I even playing thisgame at all, after dismissing it in my Switch New Classics reviews?Well, my gaming instinct just wouldn’t forget it, and started pinningfor it again after some time. That’s pretty weird, but not unseen before — somuch so that I actually wrote a post about that phenomenon. For now, suffice itto say that I was right to cave in and get my paws on Harvestella again,as I’m enjoying it tremendously.  That’s not to say that Harvestella is a great game, or that I’deven recommend it to any fellow gamer. In fact, Harvestella is bristlingwith flaws; and I can safely say that I’m enjoying it despite theseflaws. I’m not talking about minor stuff such as the bizarre design of the malecharacters, but rather about serious gameplay shortcomings. Lets’ break down myHarvestella experience, shall we?   Fighting system: I lovereal-time combat as a rule, but Harvestella’s take on is too complex forits own good. The main issue here is that you cannot indulge in melee combatwithout taking copious amounts of damage, because a) foes can attack you from adistance, and b) they can attack you no matter what you’re doing. As a result,you’ll take damage every step of the way: while you approach foes, but also whileyou’re unleashing combos and skills, moving around or even dodging.   How do you alleviate that issue? Well, there are two ways. You can godown the intended road, by using the Job system: switch party members and Jobson the fly, to target opponents’ weaknesses and dispose of them quickly andneatly. Or you can go down the road I chose, by grinding so much that youbecome overlevelled and can take attacks without batting an eyelid! Now thatI’ve reached that state, I can honestly say that I relish fighting; but I canjust as honestly admit that it was an absolute chore in the game’s earlystages, when I had to keep an eye on my HP bar at all times.   Dungeon crawling: It shouldsurprise absolutely no one that this is my favourite part of the game. Harvestella’sdungeons are gorgeous, well-designed and full of appetizing secrets, and I havea blast not only exploring them, but also revisiting them on a regular basis.Indeed, there’s always a good reason to revisit dungeons in that game — to fulfil side quests, to forage, to defeat previously overpoweredfoes, to access previously locked areas metroidvania-style, you name it.   Thenagain — and once again — things were not that cosy in the early stages. The timemanagement factor frustrated the life out of me at first, as it forced me toexit dungeons and scurry back to bed just when I was getting into the groove ofcrawling. However, I quickly realised that Harvestella’s dungeons arefiendishly designed to enable another type of crawling groove, which I’d dub‘iterative exploration’. Instead of losing yourself in long crawling sessions,you stack up much shorter ones; yet each of these short sessions gives you a palpablesense of accomplishment and allows you to progress a bit further, until you’vemade the whole dungeon your b*tch.   This ismade possible thanks to a clever in-dungeon bypass system: as you progress, youcan unlock shortcuts and teleportation points that allow you to skip alreadyexplored sections. This design provides neat intermediate goals, as well as afulfilling sense of progression; and I can honestly claim that I get a blastout of Harvestella’s brand of crawling.   Farming, cooking and crafting: The weakest link! Okay, I’m exaggerating a bit here; it would befairer to talk about ‘missed opportunities’. We have a farming, cooking andcrafting system that could have been awesome, yet ends up being merelypalatable due to a number of questionable design choices. The crafting systemsuffers from the teeny-tiny number of available items —at that point, it would have been just as convenient to make said itemsavailable in shops. The cooking system is hampered by the rarity of someingredients, which makes many dishes unavailable for some infuriatingly longtime — I mean, do you know how long it took me to finally harvest that darnQueen Leaf and be able to brew Tea? Some 45 hours, that’s how long!   But theseannoyances pale compared to the crippling flaw that maims the farming system;and that crippling flaw is none other than the money balance. To put itsimply, all farming-related purchases, from mere seeds to fancy farmimprovements, are ludicrously expensive; yet at the same time, money isridiculously hard to come by, despite the fact that there are a ton of items tosell. Foraged items sell for a pitifully low price — including stuff that shouldcommand high prices, such as gold ore or super-rare materials. Crafted andtransformed goods are no better, as they sell for a price that’s way too low tojustify the hassle of mass-producing them in order to gain money.    Take theSudor Pepper life cycle, for instance: a single plant retails for 265 grillas,and can be harvested five times in a row with a growing period of four days forthe first harvest and three days for the subsequent ones. Grown Sudor Pepperssell for 265 grillas as well; it can be transformed into Black Pepper, whichsells for 335 grillas. This means that a single Sudor Pepper plant will grantyou a benefit of 1410 grillas at most, over a period of 16 days — not exactly adream rentability, methinks.   Thesepoor rates of return directly — and direly — impact farming, and the enjoymentthat can be derived from it. Instead of sowing, harvesting and expanding yourfarm like it like it’s going out of fashion, you have to scrape by andcarefully consider each purchase. Harvestella packs some great farmingpotential; but one must accept that years of game time — and dozens of hours ofactual play time — are mandatory to unlock that great potential.   Story: In true Squeenixfashion, we have a meaty and convoluted story to back up the crawling and thefarming. Whether that story is good or not can be debated; I can honestly say Idon’t expect much from it, which means that I probably won’t be disappointed inthe end. It so happens that I tackled every single side quest, for the sake ofgetting precious money and items first and last; yet some of these questspacked truly moving developments, which was a plus. In fact, I daresay thatthese secondary side quests stories are more touching and interesting that themain story, which is often too ludicrous for its own good — and poorly told to boot.   Forinstance (spoilers!): how long are we gonna keep pretending that Ariacomes from a distant future, when it’s actually painfully obvious that shecomes from a distant past? I started suspecting this a few chapters agoalready; and as I’m inching closer to the end of chapter 6, the hints havepiled up so much that they might as well be the Everest. Surely it should beobvious by now that Aria was absorbed whole by the Seaslight, fell into a comaof sorts and remained in stasis until she was discovered by Ein at thebeginning of the game, right? How come the whole crew is still clueless aboutthe whole thing, despite seeing the revealing footage in the Astrum Helixfacility? I cannot help but think that this is very poor exposition indeed — orthat Harvestella is geared towards young players that haven’t consumed alot of fiction yet and won’t see the plot twist coming from a mile away (endof spoilers).   As yousee, I’m not exactly lavishing praise on Harvestella; and yet, I’ve beenplaying it for 60 hours, and I firmly intend to get myself more of it. Harvestella’ssaving grace can be summed up in one sentence: that game is more than the sumof its parts. Taken separately and on their own merits, the story, farming anddungeon crawling sides feel too weak and would undoubtedly fail to hold theplayer’s attention; yet once put together, they gel and complete each otheramazingly well. There is no shortage of things to do in Harvestella; notonly that, but the game is blatantly designed to generate a flurry of activity.Focusing solely on one side of the game — whether it be farming&crafting,dungeon crawling or side questing — quickly feels boring and tedious; it’s muchmore thrilling and rewarding to switch between these sides on the fly, from oneday to the next or even over the course of a single day.   I’m on aroll now; the game is nearly playing itself, and I could go on effortlesslylike that for many more hours. And talking about this, it’s time for my dailyplaying session! I’ll see you soon with more gaming goodness, dear fellowgamers; in the meantime, keep playing and take care!"},

Time management has always been my ownpersonal kryptonite; and although I’m trying to fix that, progress is slow tocome.

{"title": "Asdivine Hearts: Back to business! ", "date": "24/05/2023", "text": "A looong time ago, I started Asdivine Hearts, and polished offa good half of the game; and just a couple of days ago, my gaming instinctclaimed the other half. I obviously complied, because who am I to say no to thegaming instinct?    Ten hours later, AH is done and dusted. Or not so much,actually; I only witnessed Stella’s Ending, and didn’t feel the need to reloadClear Data to watch the other outcomes. I’ll be honest: the harem element leftme cold, and even annoyed me at times. As far as the narrative is concerned, Idefinitely prefer Bond of the Skies, whose story and characterinteractions were both less intrusive and more touching.    Fortunately, AH is entirely redeemed by its huge focus ongrinding, and its overall grinding-friendliness. Gosh, does this game know howto make a grinding fiend happy! Not only does it give you excellent reasonsto grind, but it also gives you convenient ways to grind:   — Thereasons: Apart from the thrill of reaching L.99, the main incentive to grindlike a beast is the Magic system. In a nutshell: Magic comes in three forms,namely Light, Shadow and Void. Party members learn one of the three“naturally”, and the other two by equipping specific crystals; this means thatyou can have all characters master all types of magic. But wait, that’s notall: wielding all three types at once grants you access to specific spells thatinclude party heal, meaning that your whole party can be potential Healers. Ifyou put in the grind, that is!    — Theways: Luckily, AH gives you everything you need to grind painlessly. Thegame world kindly provides two spots (see pictures below) teeming with metalfoes that, in true Dragon Quest fashion, give you a crap ton of XP. Youcan also max up the effect of your grinding sessions by using Hearty Peels andHearty Fruits, two items that double the amount of XP and SP reaped from afight. Then you have the ultimate grinding facilitator: the Attract Jewel, whichtriggers a battle for every step taken. Perfect for your late game grinding sessions!   Grinding becomes really tedious in the late stages, as theamount of XP needed to gain levels becomes absurdly enormous; but fortunately,reaching the big 99 is by no means necessary to beat the final boss in easymode; although I peaked at Lv.95, that final showdown was a cakewalk. Do Iregret grinding so much? Why, not at all! Grinding is a pleasure in and ofitself for me, you know dat.  Long story short: I spent a lovely time with Asdivine Hearts,and I totally don’t regret buying the Asdivine physical collection forthe Switch. And thus my love story with Kemco continues!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Engage: Should I play or should I pawn?", "date": "01/05/2023", "text": "After some five hours spent on Engage, I’m really torn aboutsoldiering on or not; so much so that I shelved the game under further notice — or, in that case, a firm decision from my gaming instinct. Thereare many things I love in Engage, but there are just as many things Idespise; and I’m gonna try to sort out these feelings by jotting them downhere.   TheGood: — Theart style! Not gonna lie: the character design and cover art were the firstthings that caught my eye, and they immediately made me immensely partialtowards Engage. I cannot find words to express how much I love thatcombination of blue, red and white in Alear’s design (I’m French, so obviouslythat specific mix is gonna tug at my heartstrings), and how much I dig the sheer brilliance ofMika Pikazo’s work on colours. Art direction very seldom plays a part in myliking a game, but it totally does as far as Engage is concerned.  — Hugefocus on battling! Now that’s something that plays a huge part in myliking a game; and Engage is more than happy to indulge me. First, nocutscene is sacred in that game, as they can all be skipped. Secondly,enemy phase in battles can be bypassed entirely, and battle animations can beturned off. Thirdly, non-battling gameplay elements can be cut to a bareminimum. For instance: after every battle, you get to chat with your units onthe cleared battlefield, and reap ‘Bond Points’, an in-game currency, as you doso. Say you’re in an Elvis mood and want a little less conversation, a littlemore action please? Feel free to exit the scene and move on to the next battle,as the game will kindly grant you every Bond Points you’d have reaped throughchit-chatting!   TheBad: —  Grinding is too tedious! Engageoffers optional battles for the level-grinders amongst us; but these battlesare routinely harder than story battles. That’s not how it should work,dang it! This is a breach of all non-written grinding rules since the dawn ofRPG!   — Battlesare too strategic! Am I really blaming an SPRG for being strategic?Err, not really. What I’m saying is that Engage’s battles are simply toochallenging for me — even in Normal mode. For one thing, the number offoes on each map is simply astounding; you’re outnumbered as a rule, in everysingle battle. For another, battles are really just plain hard. Take thechapter 8 battle, for instance: you have to use a ballista and quellwaves of Pegasus Knights coming at you every turn! It should surprise no onethat I threw the towel at the beginning of that battle, and haven’t touched thegame since.   Thebottom line is that Engage doesn’t accommodate my tried-and-tested wayof playing Fire Emblem. I usually grind as much as I can, rollwith the strongest units, and go at opponents without worrying too much aboutstrengths and weaknesses and unit type complementarity; and it turns out thatthis way of playing is difficult to pull off in Engage. Here, you haveto worry about weapon and unit type complementarity and plan every movecarefully, lest you be swarmed and overpowered by the opposition.  Yup, I really love my girl Alear. Thequestion now is: can I find a way to make Engage work for me? There is alot of goodness to be salvaged in that game, and I must admit it’s still kindapulling at me as I’m writing this. If only I could find an efficient way togrind, and maybe strategize more… I mean, some players are soloing the game inMaddening mode; surely it shouldn’t be so hard to wrap my head about whateverstrategizing is needed to progress smoothly in Normal mode, should it? At any rate, Engage is shelved until my gaming instinct decides its fate."},
{"title": "Gaming, a Lady and I", "date": "16/04/2023", "text": "Hullo, dear fellow gamers! Way back when I launched ThatExtra Level, I also started following a couple of gaming blogs that struckmy fancy. I still follow them to this day; one of these blogs is LadiesGamers,then known as A Lady and Gaming. LadiesGamers changed a lot over the years,going from a cosy, tiny blog to a huge site full to the brim with content andactivity; one thing that never changed, though, is the presence of Lady YvonneVan Geloven at the helm. It’s now time to invite her for a revealing gaminginterview!   Hello, dear Yvonne! I’m so glad to have you here, afterall these years! First thing I must ask you is: how did your gaming journeystart? The more details, the better!  Thank you for having me, Isleif! It’s been quite some timesince we first met on the internet highway, when I found your blog had linkedto my blog. Isn’t it special, how we never met in real life, but kept incontact? It’s all based on our love of gaming, apparently a strong love whenyou find it late in life, like I have.  So, you asked how my gaming journey started… Talking aboutthat, I always feel like Sophia from the Golden Girls. Picture this…. It wasthe year 2006. I was 42 years old and had a little girl of 7 years old. We hadgotten her a Nintendo DS, at first with Nintendogs, the Spring before.But now it was summer holiday and she was free from school. As there was onlyso much time she could spend with her virtual dogs, I promised her a newgame.  I didn’t know anything about games though. She had a coupleof Gameboy Advance games of the platforming kind, that didn’t interest me inthe slightest. And I had played Zelda Windwaker with my husband on ourGamecube, but I was very much content to watch him play. It never occurred tome to be interested in a game for myself. Anyway, back to the store. Knowingnothing about games we picked her new game purely based on the cover: AnimalCrossing Wild World.  As we are Dutch, English isn’t our first language, and mydaughter couldn’t read it. This made for some lovely mother-daughter time,sitting on the couch playing together. We started the town, met Tom Nook andgot all kinds of chores. After a while, she got a bit bored at picking upshells and planting flowers, as there’s only so much you can do in the firstdays. So, she went off to go do something else and I did what so many mothersdo: I decided to work on it, for her.  Yeah…right…that ended up not being so much for her. I lovedit, couldn't stop playing. And when she went away in the weekend for asleepover I missed the town (and the DS) so much! That’s when I decided to splurgeand buy a device and the game for myself. And that was the beginning of it all!The town of Bearpath was born, and it kept me glued to the screen for 1,5years. Every single day, as you have to keep on top of it in Animal Crossing.And what made Animal Crossing even more brilliant? Playing online, visitingeach other’s towns and chatting together in a group especially for grownup fansof AC.   What does gaming bring to your life? Do you feel it’ssomething unique that nothing else can provide?  That’s a difficult question. When I was younger, before Ihad my daughter, I was very much into reading and gardening. Had my own littlegreenhouse and watched every episode of Gardeners World on the BBC. Thegardening centre was my favourite place to be, but in hindsight I can see I wasmainly drawn to the sense of discovery. Finding new plants, growing my own fromseed, making arrangements in hanging baskets. Trying to find a special speciesthat Gardeners World had shown. Of course, seeing them in my own garden was thebest feeling, but even then I wasn’t much into the constant weeding and tidyingthings. And somehow, it never seemed to turn out like Alan Titchmarch had shownon tv. Weeds were a constant, and no matter how diligently I tried to subduethem, they always won in the end.  I gave that up when my daughter was born. As every motherwill recognize, I had a serious lack of time to spend on hobbies, especiallysince I also had a job. The only pastime that stayed was reading, as it’seasier to do for half an hour before you turn off the light at night. Readingabout other people's lives, unravelling mysteries and losing myself in a goodfantasy story was always lovely.  Gaming gives me that same feeling of adventure, ofdiscovery and exploration, finding new things and meeting new characters.That’s what I love the most. In a sense, games are my books turned into visualadventures. It’s the right hobby for the right time in my life. And it providedme with friends all over the globe. Something my other hobbies haven’t done forme. Maybe that’s what is most unique about it: finding like-minded people andkeeping the contact going. Turning from talking about just games to becoming apart of each other’s lives.  What’s your favourite gaming era? Is there a specificsystem, type of game or gaming period you’d like to explore more? My favourite gaming era is always the last era. I’m notinto retro gaming, and I honestly don’t know why I’d settle for lesser graphicswhen games can be so beautiful these days. For example, I never went back toolder Animal Crossing games. I always play the last one on Switch, neverreturning to Wild World or the GameCube version.  You could say my main draw in a game is the graphics, butit’s a combination of my favourite genre and the graphics. I can honestly enjoythe scenery in a game like Atelier Ryza or Breath of the Wild somuch. Just standing at the top of a hill in Hyrule while the sun is coming upand a wistful tune plays….talk about a special moment! What do you think of the current gaming landscape?  I think there’s never been a better time to be a gamer. Thelandscape is diverse, my favourite genres are finally getting the attentionthey deserve. And gaming isn’t something for young adult males onlyanymore.  What is your favourite gaming genre, and what do you lovein that genre? Well, there are several. I love simulation games likeAnimal Crossing, farming games like Story of Seasons and turn based RPG likethe Persona games. And what’s even better: combinations of those farming,crafting, RPG sims. I don’t like pressure in games, timers and action-basedfighting where I need to be on my toes constantly. Relaxing while playing isimportant to me, and I love me some cute colourful graphics as well.  I’ve mentioned Breath of the Wild already: normallyI’m not a big Zelda gamer, I always have trouble finding out what to donext in the normal Zelda games. But the open world and the vastness ofthe world really struck a chord with me. I think I must be the only gamerthat’s enthusiast about the game for all the wrong reasons! I never evenmastered the flurry attack or beat the big monsters. Could you tell us a funny anecdote related to your gamingcareer? It can be anything!  Before COVID struck, I had the good fortune to be invitedto the pre-E3 events of Nintendo Benelux. Representing LadiesGamers of course.Though I was very chuffed to be included, and went there straight from work. Asluck had it, it was across the road where my office was, where I work in mydaytime job. I don’t think I have ever felt so out of place. Can you imagineme, an older lady in my business attire straight from the office. And then theother people: young, very casually clothed, some with colourful hair orpiercings and tattoos. Or just what you would expect in a stereotype nerdy gamer.And aside from me feeling out of place, I could clearly see that the otherswere thinking what on earth I was doing there. The next time I went I broughtmy daughter with me and made sure I was dressed to fit in just a littlemore!  Last but not least, can you tell me five of your favouritegames, and why you love them?   My absolute favourite of all times is Animal Crossing.And as the last instalment has so many improvements, New Horizons is the bestat the moment. The laid-back gameplay, there’s so much to do and to collect andthe way you can get as creative as you want to be. It looks amazing, and I’vealways loved how for example all appliances really work. But the reason I lovethis series best is the way you can share in the fun with friends. It hasgotten me some very good friends across the globe over the years. My second choice is the Atelier series, and heretoo, I’d like to recommend the last instalments best. Atelier Ryza 2 isabsolutely amazing, as is Atelier Sophie 2. Combining the best ofsynthesizing, exploring, gathering and turn based battles is absolutely perfectfor me.  Third must be the Story of Seasons series, and thelast game Pioneers of Olive Town. Farming, mining, crafting, socializingwith the characters in town. I love it, though I must confess that there’salways a moment where I feel that enough is enough. When I feel like I’mturning into a production factory, it’s time to step back.  The Legend of Zelda - Breath of theWild isfourth. Maybe a title you wouldn’t expect on my list, but this game reallystole my heart. Sometimes you just have to hear the music making you want todive right back in. I’m awful at the fighting, I’ve never managed to get togrips with the Flurry Attack. But the feeling of climbing the next mountain andstanding there watching the sunrise to the beautiful music score is so verypowerful. I love it for its exploration! Fifth place is a hard choice for me. I feel that I shouldmention indie games in general. Over the years of reviewing them for LadiesGamersI feel there are so many gems made by small studios. Not the big blockbusters,but passion projects that ask us for funding on Kickstarter to help make theirvision of a game come true. I’ve backed quite a few, and it’s been a nicesurprise every time one was ready for release.   Now that covered the gaming side, let’s move on to theblogging! Can you tell us what kickstarted your blogging journey? Every detailis welcome! When I was younger, I had dreams of someday being apublishing writer. I even started my own book but didn’t get much further thana couple of chapters. When I found my gaming passion and couldn’t really talkabout it with people in real life, the writing about it came easily. After all,if I wanted to chat about my passion to friends and family, they all looked atme as if I’d lost my marbles. Writing about it was easier, and there were acouple of good friends I’d found online who were willing to read what Iwrote.  It started out with thoughts about my latest game I wantedto put onto my computer screen, so I’d have no trouble picking the game upagain if I returned to it in the future. With that, the first version of myblogging adventure started. All this led to my A Lady and Gaming blog that Istarted in 2014.  We all know blogging requires a lot of dedication andendurance, even when you love it. Were there ever times when you consideredtaking a long break, or even stopping? If yes, how did you manage to overcomethese roadblocks?  This may sound very strange but no, I never had thathappen. The thing is, I don’t put any pressure on myself. Especially in thosefirst years when I filled the pages alone, I wrote because it gave me positiveenergy. If I didn’t feel like writing, I didn’t. No problem and no need to feelbad. But most of the time thoughts about gaming jumbled about in my head andthey wanted out. Maybe because in real life I had a very different job as afinance controller. Much more down to earth, analytic, logical and some wouldsay boring. Writing about my hobby could be done anywhere, even during my lunchbreak at work! So in short, no pressure and just letting the words flow wheninspiration hit!  LadiesGamers sure changed a lot over time! What made youwant to bring new writers in? Do you plan more evolutions for yourbaby? Can you tell me five of your favourite gaming blogs, and why youlove them?  You’re right, it has changed. A fellow writer I met throughblogging, who sadly passed away a few years ago, asked if I would review somegames for him. He had gotten some review codes, but hated reviewing gameshimself. We agreed he would publish the reviews first, and my renamed site,LadiesGamers, could publish it a while later. Eventually though the codes keptcoming and I couldn’t handle it alone. This made me think I needed to invitepeople to write with me and in 2017 the first writer joined me.  Nowadays, LadiesGamers is going strong and grows everyyear. At any one time, we have a team of 8 people who all work on reviews andarticles as a hobby as LadiesGamers doesn’t have any source of income. I saywe, as Paula, who I’ve known since 2016, has joined me in managing the site. Itreally is too big now to run alone, as I also have a full time job. Plus, it’smuch more fun working on it together. We try to keep the site advert free and have a Patreon pageto generate a bit of income. And I hope, in future, that we can keep it advertfree and a safe, restful and colourful haven. Aside from keeping an eye on your blog, I don’t follow manyblogs anymore. Only Matt’s Nintendobound. Yours are the only two that remained,somehow most of the blogs that I followed when I started out have stopped! A question to sum them all up: do you feel gaming andblogging made your life better, and how? ^^ It certainly did! It gives me positive energy, I’ve madegood friends because of it and I hope I’ll keep on playing and writing foryears to come."},
{"title": "Gaming musings: Fleeting Firm Feelings ", "date": "08/04/2023", "text": "Heythere, dear fellow gamers! Hope you’re doing fine, and doing your stuff likethere’s no tomorrow. As for me, things are clearing up at long last; the tricky situation that was robbing me of my beloved autonomy is about to be resolved, which should grant me some welcome time and energy tofinish the New Classic project and start the building of my website. On top ofthat, I’m gaming like the wind and enjoying it tremendously, and plenty ofappetizing games are hitting the shelves. But enough with the pleasantries;let’s tackle this post’s main subject! As youknow, my gaming instinct is a reliable compass that never failed me, a beaconthat guided me flawlessly through my many decades of gaming. Still, even themost perfect tool can falter sometimes; and it so happens that my trustworthygaming instinct isn’t 100% right in all circumstances. This is precisely what Idubbed ‘Fleeting Firm Feelings’; that’s an explicit enough name, and it meansthat my gaming instinct’s initial feelings about a game are sometimesoverturned — by none other than my gaming instinct itself.  Inpractice, 3F unfolds in three main ways:  — FromGood to Gone: I have a massive crush on a game, only to forget it entirelya couple of days or weeks later.— FromFair to Good: I deem a game merely acceptable, only to have it grow on meover the next days or weeks.— FromGone to Good: I dismiss a game entirely, only to have it coming back andhaunting me a couple of days or weeks later.  As youmay imagine, the New Classics project is the perfect ground for 3F; the veryact of playing a short time and relying solely on my gaming instinct’ immediateimpressions generated a number of occurrences of 3F already — and will probablygenerate some more before I’m through with the whole endeavour. One of theseoccurrences is none other than a Switch game I’m currently playing and lovingto pieces, a couple of weeks after swearing it off in my New Classics reports —but more on that particular game later! For now, suffice it to say that my subcollectionsare not quite set in stone yet; before I start pawning my discarded games, I’llcheck carefully for any Good to Gone or Gone to Good occurrences. Jeez, acollector’s work is never done indeed!  On a moregeneral note, I’m seriously starting to wonder if I won’t simply keep nearlyall my games — New Classics as well as rejects. The thing is, I’mrealising now that the New Classics project was first and last a matter ofsetting priorities and freeing my mind from backlog pressure; now that the deedis nearly done, getting physically rid of games that didn’t make the cutdoesn’t feel as urgent. Keeping most of the rejects won’t take a lot of room,as I got rid of all plastic cases years ago; and pawning my games won’t bringme a lot of moneys anyways, as we’re dealing with loose cartridges and UMD. Ofcourse, some games will be disposed of, and that would be thegames I really loathe — I don’t think any amount of time will make mefall in love with the Disgaea series, for instance.  Longstory short: I wanna keep all my options open, and my beloved Collection ascomplete and replete as possible, for the sake of my gaming pleasure andfuture. I may end up never touching the rejects I keep, but that doesn’tmatter; what matters is to gain as much freedom to play as I want, whilebeing firmly aware of my gaming preferences and favourite games. Tackling theNew Classics project was absolutely vital to my gaming enjoyment; I feel atpeace now, and I can keep playing and collecting in a more relaxed, carefreeway. Happy gaming days ahead!"},
{"title": "Dabbling in Demos: GrimGrimoire OnceMore", "date": "07/04/2023", "text": "GrimGrimoire OnceMore is aSwitch remaster of a PS2 game co-developed by Vanillaware and Nippon IchiSoftware. That makes two potential reasons to dislike it; namely Vanillawareand NIS, as most offerings from these two didn’t click with me at all (more onthat in former New Classics reports). Still, Vanillaware and NIS pale incomparison to my main, and actual, reason to dislike GGOM. We’re dealing with an RTS game; and as you know, I really don’t fancy RTS.    I canacknowledge the sheer originality of a 2D side-scrolling RTS, and howground-breaking it was to get such a game on a console back in the days;however, I’m long done playing as a gaming historian. I play now as a gamer whowants to have fun, and I don’t have fun playing GGOM. It’s not a horrible game, mind you; the controls areserviceable, the graphics are gorgeous, cutscenes can be skipped and action canbe sped up. I tried the tutorial earnestly, and even kinda enjoyed it at first;however, I was quickly overwhelmed by the number of tasks to manage at once. By‘quickly’, I mean right from the second battle; I had to summon Fairies andmove them to attack foes, while keeping an eye on my already deployed Fairiesand Elves; and that proved too much for the multitasker I am not.  Apartfrom my not fancying RTS, I’m seriously starting to wonder if I don’t have aninstinctive dislike of all things PS2. I mean, this is the fourth PS2 remake Idislike, after Okami, Psyvariar Delta and Dragon Quest VIII; and you know what they say — once ishappenstance, twice is coincidence, etc. Given how remakes of games from formergames are flooding the Switch now, I may encounter another PS2 remake sooner orlater; if/when this happens, I’ll check the game carefully, or play the demo ifit exists. And since I’m mentioning demos — onto the next one!"},
{"title": "Dabbling in Demos: Bayonetta Origins – Cereza and the Lost Demon", "date": "31/03/2023", "text": "This gameis the work of Platinum Games, and it stars a younger version of Cereza, theuber-badass and gorgeous Umbra Witch from Bayonetta; yet anybodyexpecting anything even remotely close to, well, Bayonetta, is in for asore disappointment.   That’snot to say that Cereza is a bad game; in fact, it’s a truly excellentgame, and it’s on its way to becoming a welcome addition to The Collection — anda New Classic of mine, providing that the gameplay remains as fulfilling as inthe demo. I won’t elaborate on the splendid graphics and unique atmosphere,because anybody with a functioning pair of retinas can plainly see all thegoodness Cereza has to offer on that front; instead, I’ll rave about thegameplay, the controls, and the character chemistry.  So,gameplay: we’re dealing with an action-adventure game, and a rather deliberateone at that — told you this was no Bayonetta. Little Cereza starts thegame on her own, but is soon joined by the titular Lost Demon, who winds uppossessing Cereza’s stuffed cat toy Cheshire. Both Cereza and Cheshire boastunique abilities, and can combine them in various ways to progress; as you mayguess, that combination of abilities forms the core of Cereza’sgameplay. You have to move the characters sometimes together, sometimesseparately; this could have been a recipe for controls disaster, but it’sdiabolically well-handled and ends up being incredibly satisfying instead. Welldone, Platinum Games!   HandlingCereza and Cheshire together doesn’t just feel fulfilling in terms of controlsand physics; it also creates a unique emotion I've never felt while playing a game. The pair literally cannot progress without eachother; and that common vulnerability is echoed in the player’s experience —because you cannot progress either as long as you don’t find the rightway to combine their abilities. As a result, the bond between them is not justa narrative element; it’s also a gameplay element that you get to experienceover and over. I can only imagine that bond growing more and more potentand tangible, as the gameplay becomes more intricate and you get to deepen yourmastery of Cereza’s and Cheshire’s abilities.  Longstory short: I loved that first bite of Cereza, and I very much wannaplay the full thing. And now, on to the next demo! ^^"},
{"title": "Atelier Firis DX: My life as an explorer", "date": "26/03/2023", "text": "Or not somuch, actually. After 15 hours of intense and satisfying play, I’m done withthe grand alchemy test I was given as a goal at the beginning of the game; andincidentally, I’m done with the game as well, even though unroamed areas andunfulfilled side quests are still aplenty. I knew this would happen, mind you;and I started playing while anticipating that I would lose all will to playafter I was done with the test. I did lose all will to play all right — with abit of help from Gust, who decided to make the credits roll after the test. Youknow that ‘rolling credits’ means ‘next game please!’ to me; and that pavlovianconditioning didn’t fail to trigger this time around.    I played Atelier Firis in a trance, over a grand tally of fourdays and as many playing sessions. I would be hard-pressed to chastise it aftergorging on it so shamelessly — and yet, this is exactlywhat I’m gonna do. See, that game’s subtitle shouldn’t be “The Alchemist andthe Mysterious Journey”; it should be “Cognitive Dissonance Much?”, or “Look atthat Yummy Cake yet Don’t You Dare Taking a Bite!”.   Here’sthe problem in a nutshell: Atelier Firis gives you a whole world toexplore, a wealth of material to forage, plenty of characters to get close to,a myriad of quests to fulfil… along with a super-stringent, non-negotiabledeadline that forces you to keep an eye on the passing of days at all times andto run towards your objective at breakneck speed. Forget about losing yourselfin alchemy, exploration and fighting; you can do that all right, but only afteryou pass that darn alchemy exam.   I cannothelp but question the logic of that whole design. What’s the point of havingsuch a wide and enticing game world, only to curtail the player’s ability toexplore it to their heart’s content? I know I would have played AtelierFiris very differently without a time limit — in fact, I would probably beplaying it still, not writing about it. I would be exploring every nookand cranny of every single area, fighting like a beast, and synthesizing likethe wind… (wistful sigh)   Mind you,the alchemy test is not even that thrilling of a goal either. I went there totest the waters, and ended up passing without really trying. The first part ofthe test is a multiple-choice quiz about all things alchemy; my haphazardanswers landed me a tally of 11/20. Then, I had to synthesize the best item Icould; I went with a mere Bomb, because it was the only item I had craftedenough to get a Platinum Star synthesis level; my toiling at the cauldronproduced a Bomb with a quality value of 53. Then, I had to damage a Puniwith 9999 HP; I threw a Lightning Crystal at it, and did 149 damage. Then, Ihad to fight Ilmeria; and as I was a puny lv.15 against her lv.25, shethoroughly mopped the floor with me.   I thoughtfor sure I would fail miserably after such a lacklustre performance on allfronts; but colour me flabbergasted, I actually passed! Did Mom’s lovinglyhand-sewn outfit boost my luck, or did the exam committee take pity on me? Oris that alchemy test just really easy, a mere formality to mark the end of themain game? I don’t know, and I don’t really care right now.    Technically,Atelier Firis wouldn’t make the cut as a New Classic on its own. I had ablast playing it, that I cannot deny; but I had ten times more of a blastplaying Sophie, which I deem better on all fronts bar the openness ofthe game world. But it so happens that I own Firis as part of theAtelier Mysterious Trilogy Deluxe Pack for the Switch; it’s on thecartridge anyway, which saves me the hassle of deciding whether I keep it ornot. And I can always replay it later if my gaming instinct claims it —win-win!  I cannot say for sure if I'll ever replay Atelier Firis; what I know for sure, on the other hand, is that I've written enough about it for now. I'll see you soon with more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers; keep doing yourthing, and take care!"},
{"title": "Dabbling in Demos: Gal Guardians – Demon Purge", "date": "24/03/2023", "text": "I don’treally know why I downloaded that demo, to be honest. I mean, I’ve never founda Metroidvania that suited me; and the only reason I’ve not yet renounced thegenre as a whole is my hopeless, never-dying gaming optimism. Still, I didn’thave much hope for Gal Guardians; in fact, I fully expected to getbored upon a few minutes of play.   As youmay have guessed already, things didn’t turn this way at all. Not onlydid I polish off the whole demo, but I was also left seriously hooked andcraving for more — so much so that I actually replayed the whole thing severaltimes! Needless to say, GG joined my Coveted Game List faster thanyou can say ‘vade retro’.   So, whatmade me so utterly smitten, you may ask? Why is GG the firstMetroidvania ever to touch my jaded gamer’s soul? First, the physics aretop-notch; and you know how crucial that element is to me as far as Platformersare concerned. Secondly, the party dynamics are absolutely amazing; neverbefore have I handled a pair of MCs that so perfectly complement and complete eachother. Thirdly, the music, graphics and overall atmosphere are downrightsplendid. Last but not least, the progression curve is darn satisfying: GGis challenging without being unfair, and I could feel myself gettingstronger, sharper and better as I replayed the demo.   Well,that’s a New Classic all right! Not many games can claim that honour beforethey even hit the shelves; but that’s the beauty of pre-release demos for you.Talking about demos, I have a couple of them downloaded on my Switch and readyfor the testing; they may or may not generate a couple of crushes and futurepurchases — but they’ll sure generate some posts. Stay tuned, and take care! ^^"},
{"title": "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon – Rescue Team DX: Here we crawl again!", "date": "21/03/2023", "text": "I totallymeant it when I swore that game off last year; deep in my gamer’s soul, I wasabsolutely convinced that I would never, ever want to play it again. Yet hereI am, with a second run under my belt, all happy and sated! This goes to showthat my gaming instinct is a fickle yet loyal beast; and that it’s wiser notto discard a game I love, lest I find myself forced to purchase it again tosatisfy the reawakened urge to replay said game.  As far asRescue Team DX is concerned, I went above and beyond the call of duty:not only did I replay the game, but I also replayed it with the exact samecharacters — Skitty as my MC and Pikachu as my partner-in-crawl — and gave themthe exact same names as during my first run.   However,that’s as far as similarities between my two runs go. I ended up with differentMove pools and Rare Qualities without even trying, but that’s only the tip ofthe iceberg; the most important change is that this time around, I didn’t fallprey to the Early Endgame trap. I knew that main story dungeons were fewand far between, that the Sky Tower was the last dungeon, and that it wouldcome much sooner than expected, because huge postgame; and so, I tackledmissions to my heart’s content between each main story dungeon, and wentthrough a massive grinding spree right before the Sky Tower.    Iactually ended up over-levelled as a result, with Sakura boasting a hefty lv.55and Pika-Cute a no less hefty lv.45. This made the Sky Tower a cakewalk, andfinal boss Rayquaza a pushover; however, I didn’t mind. I was playing that gameto crawl and grind like a beast, and that’s exactly what I did. Ah, to tacklebatches of missions in these lovely dungeons! I had forgotten how gorgeous RTDXlooks, with its hand-drawn art style and bright colours.   Longstory short: I had a blast replaying that game for 20 delightful hours, andit’s not going anywhere. Good thing I hadn’t sold it before my gaming instinctclaimed it again!"},
{"title": "The New Classics: Progress report #8", "date": "12/03/2023", "text": "Heythere, dear fellow gamers! Hope you’re doing fine, and indulging in whatever makesyou happy. I said I was going to play some games in earnest for a change in mylast New Classics progress reports, and that is exactly what I did — andwhat I’m still doing 🤩 Gosh, Ihad forgotten how amazing it feels to dive into a game and lose oneselfin it completely. I’m done replaying PMD: Rescue Team DX, and about towrap up a run of Atelier Firis DX; Fire Emblem Engage is next,alongside another game whose identity I’ll keep hidden for suspense’s sake. Igot back into beloved gaming habits of mine, such as racking up evening playingsessions with my favourite TV shows in the background and munchies within reach— and boy, was it incredible.  How is myindulging in full runs of games related to the New Classics project, you mayask? Well, it was a bit of a wake-up call, which reminded me that I’m a playerfirst and that collecting is only a mean to that playing end. It also remindedme that I want to write about playing games, not about sorting them out;and so, I’m gonna streamline my New Classics input from now on. First, I’llfinish the whole thing: then, I’ll deliver synthetic posts including the listof happy winners, along with my feelings about the testing process and the revampedstate of my collection. I figured out that there is no need to list the gamesthat didn’t make the cut; should anyone be interested, these games can be deducedfrom my initial New Classics Contenders List anyway. Now,regarding the PSP situation. As I proceeded to put my PSP library to the NewClassics test a couple of weeks ago, I discovered that half of my PSP backup units were virtually dead,with battery packs no longer charging and holding power. The other half willprobably die soon enough; I could try and purchase replacement batteries, butthey’ll probably be dead on arrival as well. I already had doubts about theperennity of the PSP due to the flimsy UMD drive; and that battery issue onlymade me more suspicious, and soured my feelings towards the PSP as a piece of kit.Still, I’m not gonna throw the baby out with the bathwater and get rid ofeverything PSP. Instead, I’m gonna:1-     Put my PSP collection to the NewClassics test as planned, using my still-alive-and-charging PSPs.2-     Get rid of my faulty PSPs and gamesthat don’t make the cut.3-     Hold onto my still-alive PSPsand games that make the cut; AND emulate the latter on one of my Vitas, just incase the former die on me. If I own the UMDs, I should be safe on the legalfront, right? Perfect plan!  With thatsaid, I’ll see you soon with actual run reports, dear fellow gamers! Take care,stay tuned, and keep doing whatever makes you happy! ^^"},
{"title": "The New Classics: Progress Report #7", "date": "26/02/2023", "text": "Hellothere, dear fellow gamers! Hope you’re doing fine, and indulging in whatevertickles your fancy. The New Classics project is progressing mightily fine,as I’m done putting ALL my subcollections to the test bar the PSP. Yay, me! Thecompanion reports will come eventually as well, I promise. I cannot write as much as I’dlike these days due to other matters; but I very much want, and firmly plan, towrite them. In the meantime, here are a couple of insights from the New Classicepic: — About SRPGs: I changed my stance on the matter — again! It turns out that I don’tactually dislike all SRPGs, nor the genre as a whole: I just dislike SRPGs thatare too slow and/or complicated. Fast-paced and/or simple SRPGs, on the otherhand, are right up my alley! Case in point, a couple of them passed the NewClassic test with flying colours. Now, what do I mean by “complicated” and “simple”,you may ask? I could write a whole essay about that, but I won’t; I’ll just saythat it all boils down to the level of intuitiveness. If I can grasp thegameplay in a flash without any tutorial, then the game is ‘simple’; if I fumbleand struggle even with the tutorial, then the game is ‘complicated’. As far asmy gaming instinct is concerned, Disgaea 5 is complicated, while SummonNight 6 is simple.   — Aboutmy Japanese games: I decided to put them to the New Classics test as well,although I said I wouldn’t at first. This seems pretty logical, thinking of it:regardless of my understanding of the language, I have to determine if the atmosphereand whatever gameplay I may grasp tickle my fancy. I only own Vita, DS and PSP Japanesegames, and they’ll be dully listed in myreports.  — Aboutgames I love yet don’t wanna replay: I used to be pretty sure about my notwanting to replay a game I had played and loved; however, a recent turnaroundregarding one game I swore off in such a way made me reconsider. Also, I was pretty relaxed about the whole thing, thinking that I could always re-purchaseany previously pawned game; yet a quick price check revealed the harsh truth, namelythat many of my games from former gens are now much harder to find and/orcommand much higher prices than when I (first) purchased them. I cannot becareless, and let go of gems I may wanna replay later! I’ll thus give thesegames a new round of testing, in which I’ll replay them and re-examine myfeelings about them; then I’ll decide which ones can stay in the collection,and write a report about the whole process while I’m at it. Because I don’thave enough posts in the pipeline already, you know.   — Aboutmy PSP collection: I actually started testing it a month ago; however, I quicklyrealised that I had opened a serious can of worms. I’ll expand on the hairinessof that PSP situation in due time; for now, suffice it to say that I cowardlywisely decided to retreat and to save the testing of that collection for thevery end of the New Classic adventure.  Thatshould mean right now; but it so happens that I wanna play some games inearnest for a change, and that’s exactly what I’m gonna do — in fact, I’ve alreadystarted. My gaming instinct suddenly wanted to replay Pokemon Mystery Dungeon:Rescue Team DX a couple of days ago, even though I previously swore it off; fortunately, I hadn’t pawned it yet, and I could dive intoa new run with abandon and gusto. I also very much wanna play Atelier Firis,although not to scratch an alchemy itch. When I first played Rescue Team DX,I played Atelier Sophie at the same time, and really loved the combinationof the two; I wanna recreate that vibe, just because I can. I alsocaved in and purchased Fire Emblem Engage, because my gaming instinct desperatelywanted to play it, right now.  Thismeans that I’ll stop posting New Classics progress reports for now: instead,you can expect posts about Fire Emblem Engage and Atelier Firis,as well as reports about my subcollections. I’ll see you later with all thatgaming goodness, dear fellow gamers; in the meantime, keep doing your thing andtake care!"},

Asfor me, I’m progressing faster than I ever thought I could through the NewClassics project. This is the result of my unwavering focus, but also ofunfavourable IRL circumstances that require compensation. I won’t enter details;but suffice it to say that some key parts of my life are beyond my controlright now — I’m the captain of a vessel sailing out in the wrong direction,trying to steer the darn ship towards a better place. That situation is boundto end soon enough, so no worries; but in the meantime, I need to gain afeeling of control and autonomy from somewhere — and what bettersomewhere than my still-uncharted-yet-not-for-long video game collection? ^^ Longstory short, I've put my whole Vita collection to the New Classic Test, and I shouldbe done with my Game Boy collection in a few days. I’ll post theWinners&Losers Lists soon enough, along with the still-unposted W&LLfor the 3DS — but more on that below. This means that I kinda crossed thehalfway mark, as I only have to explore my PSP, GBA and DS sub-collections now.Hooray! I’m really proud, let me tell ya 🤩 As for my3DS collection: I announced in last week’s report that I was going to postmy already written impressions about the few games I played; but all thingsconsidered, I really don’t feel like doing so. These impressions are mostlynegative, and I don’t wanna b*tch about games I won’t play anyway. Ranting aboutgames can feel liberating sometimes, and I’ve indulged in it more than once onthat very blog; but right now, this is the last thing I wanna do. Instead, I’llroll with the W&LL — with commentaries et al. Stay tuned, dear fellow gamers,and take care!"},
{"title": "The New Classics: Progress Report #5", "date": "05/02/2023", "text": "Dearfellow gamers, I’m proud to announce that I’m done putting my whole 3DScollection to the New Classic test! I triedwriting down my feelings about every single game, just like I did when I testedmy Switch collection; but somehow, the whole thing felt dreadful this timearound. I realised that writing about the games that didn’t click with meactually made me feel like sh*t: I was basically bitching, andsquandering my precious time and energy. As for the games I liked, I didn’t wantto write about them; I simply wanted to set them aside, until I could play themin earnest and write about them extensively.  Then camethe epiphany: if writing about every single game now feels boring, then I can,and should, dispense with that task! What I should do instead is come up withmy final list of winners and losers, along with my feelings about the wholeprocess and the revamped sub-collection du jour.  Still, I wroteabout a couple of 3DS games already, and I don’t wanna let that work go down thedrain; so I’ll post it in the next days, along with the list of games that madethe cut. Stay tuned for more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers, and takecare!"},
{"title": "The New Classics Sessions: Switch, Session 6", "date": "25/01/2023", "text": "Ender Lilies – Quietus of the Knight: Although the box art and the notion of ELQK being an ARPG really piqued my interest, I balked at thethought of purchasing it for quite some time. I was afraid the platformingaspect would prove irritating, and the dark-ish aesthetics depressing; butthose reservations were shattered during a visit at my favourite video gamestore, when I spotted ELQK andsuccumbed to its lure. And guess what? I was a million times right to do so. ELQK’s atmosphere is properly unique,and quite amazing: “depressing” doesn’t do justice to that mix of melancholy,delicateness, menace and broodiness. The physics are stellar beyond belief,with the heroine moving in an impossibly graceful yet deadly precise way. Thegraphics are splendid, with a lovely parallax effect and a striking contrastbetween the heroine’s white, glowing sprite and the layered darkness of thedécor. Do I love that game? Ooooh yes I do, folks!   Harvestella: It looks really darn pretty, that I must admit; and the characterdesign is right up my alley. Alas, combat is too slow and clunky for my taste;and the farming simulation drags on too much to keep me focused. There is asubtle difference between contemplative and boring; and this game crosses theboundary into the latter as far as I’m concerned.  Bloodstained– Ritual of the Night: There is not much missinghere, honestly. I like everything about that game, from the badass MC to theatmosphere, without forgetting the Metroidvania element; but alas, the controlsare just a bit too unprecise for me, and the physics just a bit too slippery. Isuck so much at Platformers that I simply need perfect controls andphysics — not only to enjoy myself, but also to be able to play the darn game atall.   Tasomachi– Behind the Twilight: Here’s another weirdJapanese indie developed and published by entities no one ever heard of — notthat it’s a bad thing at all, mind ya. That being said, Tasomachisuffers from the blurriest graphics this side of a cold sea fog, as well asfrom very approximative hitbox management. There seems to be no gameplay apartfrom wandering around while collecting items to reach the next zone — rinse andrepeat. But it so happens that I love Tasomachi’s atmosphere topieces; so much so that I actually bought it based on gameplay picturesalone, without even bothering to check the type of gameplay. Guess that meansany gameplay could do, right? Well, it turns out that Tasomachi’scontrols and physics are just tight enough for my taste, which makes wanderingaround a real delight. Happy retinas, happy fingers: I don’t need more towelcome a game in The Collection!    SonicFrontiers: This game seems to have a lot to offer,if the reviews are to be believed. But alas, I couldn’t even sneak a peek atall that goodness, because the darn game halted my progression and forced me toreplay its first level, until I racked up a number of arbitrary goals. SonicFRONTIERS indeed, ha-ha-ha! You know I just hate when a game playscoy or hard-to-get, and makes me jump through hoops to gain the very right to playit; and so, SF has to go.  DarkSouls Remastered: So, we have slow movement andclunky controls, paired with deadly foes that somehow seem much faster than us— despite operating in the same world, and presumably experiencing the samephysics as our MC. Some call this a thrilling challenge, and more power tothem; I call that fake difficulty, and to the pawn shop DSR goes.   Bayonetta3: After my immediate crush on the second entry, Iassumed the third would pass with flying colours; alas, it’s not so simple.First, I’m really not fond of the gloomy apocalyptic setting; secondly, the‘transforming into demons’ gimmick makes combat too fussy for my taste. I couldget used to all this, mind you; but I actually don’t need to, nor do I wantto.   BlazBlue– Cross Tag Battle: Flashy characters, greatphysics, smooth and not-too-technical combat, many ways to play, and a neatcrossover element to boot; I really don’t need more to welcome a fighting gameinto The Collection!   Omega Labyrinth Life: I knew I’d lovethat one before even playing it. I mean, a Roguelite with bright colours, cutecharacters designs, lovely tiny dungeons and a healthy dose of hilariousfan-service? My jam exactly!   Brigandine – The Legend of Runersia: This is not a brand-new IP, but a sequel to anobscure 1998 PSX game; and it’s also a game I shouldn’t want to play at all,because it’s an SRPG. And yet,something prompted me to give it a try — that‘something’ being: a) the gorgeous character art, and b) the honeycomb-shapedbattlefields. I kinda liked the little I played; and although I still havereservations, I definitely wanna see — and play — more of Brigandine. Prinny Presents NIS Classic – Volume 1: Namely, we’re dealing with Phantom Brave and Soul Nomad,two PSP RPGs. Not just mere RPGs, mind you: SRPGs.Very clunky, old-fashioned, molasses-like SRPGs. I don’t think I need toexplain why that duo won’t join The Collection.    RPG Maker MV: The Switch Lite screen is a bit too tiny for that kind of RPGbuilder, which would feel more at home on a big fat TV screen. On top of that,controls are sometimes unresponsive, and the gameplay isn’t intuitive at all. Iwould have loved to design my owndream budget RPG, but it won’t be on that particular builder.   Eastward: The art style instantlyrubbed my retinas the wrong way, and the indolent and unfocused start onlyincreased my aversion towards that game. It’s just not meant to be in TheCollection, period.    Digimon Survive: Heresy! I was fooled! Okay, I wasn’t: it’s actuallymy fault for not doing my homework, and for assuming (wrongly) that every Digimon game sported classic turn-basedfighting like Hacker’s Memory. I didn’t think the anime’s knackfor reinventing itself would extend to the games; and thus I didn’t expect Survive to be an SRPG. Now, do I wanna play an SRPG just forDigimon’s sake? No, I don’t.  Sayonara Wild Hearts: Even the most hardcore, masochistic gamer needsat least one casual game to unwind; and well, SWH is now my official casual game. It’s easy and relaxing — and gorgeous,flashy and dreamy to boot. And a full run is roughly one-hour long — pure perfection!  Touken Ranbu Warriors:It’s absolutely gorgeous, and it boasts perfect physics and splendid fightinganimations. Why, of course it deserves a spot in The Collection! One can neverown too many great Hack’n’Slashes, especially when one is little me.   Airoheart: An open homageto 16-bit Final Fantasy and Legend of Zelda had to catch my eye;however, the uber-slow gameplay — from the walking speed to the non-tweakabletext slowness — failed to catch my fancy — and my thumbs.  The Legend of Zero – Trails from Zero: The first of the Legend ofZero Switch remakes to hit the shelves, and a seriously stellar start thatgives me great hopes for the next entries. TFZboasts lush revamped graphics that still manage to retain the original PSPcharm, a smooth tactical fighting system with tweakable speed, a rich andcomplex game world and a story full of intrigue and high stakes. Last but notleast, TFZ offers a blessing calledHigh Speed Mode. As the name implies, activating that function makes the whole game run on steroids, witheverything being considerably sped up — running, combat, dialogues, you nameit. Thanks a million for that, Nihon Falcom!"},
{"title": "The New Classics Sessions: Switch, Session 4", "date": "25/01/2023", "text": "Stardew Valley: I wandered around for a couple of minutes,cutting trees and chatting with people; then I realised I was not enjoyingmyself — not to mention that I didn’t have a clue aboutwhat to do. I don’t like games on rails, but neither do I like a total lack ofguidance. On top of that, Stardew Valleyis famously open-ended, and I know I have trouble dealing with that.  Cross Code: Okay, now: I completely forgot I was supposed to test that game, andI started playing it in earnest. I forgotthe New Classic project, the world around me, and even time itself: the only thing that matteredwas Cross Code — its brilliantpuzzles, its dazzling combat, its amazing addictiveness. There is something intoxicating about that game: I’veseldom been sucked in so quickly, and so deep. That addictive quality wasmentioned in reviews, so it’s not just me — it’sthe game, mate.  Ni no Kuni – Wrath of the White Witch: I couldn’t get past the slow, mundaneprologue-meets-tutorial. Maybe an amazing RPG is waiting beyond; but I haveother amazing RPGs that are amazing rightfrom the first second. Not only that, but my gaming FOMO is now dead andburied; even if I do miss something amazing, it doesn’t matter, because TheCollection is full to the brim with amazingness already.   Children of Morta: I was instantly mesmerized by the striking atmosphere, and wanted nothing more thanto keep playing. However, fighting quickly doused my enthusiasm. Not only arethe controls on the stiff side, but foes require way too many hits to kick thebucket. No matter how much I love a good, thick atmosphere in my RPG, I won’tput up with a fighting system I dislike just for the sake of atmosphere.   Hyrule Warriors – Age of Calamity: It’s time to admit a truth I had never quiteperceived until now: I don’t really like the Zelda vibe. Sure, I love Link’s Awakening to pieces; but that game is famously not quite a classic Zelda game. What am I trying to sayhere, you may ask? Well, simply that while I enjoy HW’s combat and physics, I dislike everything else — the colours, the aesthetics, the character models, the lore, thestory, you name it. And since I already own musougames with great combat andatmospheres I like, HW has to go.   Sonic Forces: I learnt about the existence of that game only lately, as I wasreading a 2018 French book about the Sonicsaga. A little research revealed that SFgarnered some hype prior to its release, before proving a resoundingdisappointment upon said release. Research also revealed that players were muchmore forgiving to the game than game journalists, which may or may not meanthat SF is not such a complete pieceof crap after all. Of course, I hadto see for myself how SF fared — and guess what? I reallyliked it! Creating my own shitty friend was fun, running at breakneck speedthrough revamped zones was fun, and the lush graphics and bright coloursenchanted my retinas — and heck, I just want more.  Team Sonic Racing: I bought that game hoping to relive my Sonic Drift Racing days; unfortunately,that didn’t happen. Sonic Drift Racingwas simple and clear-cut, with straightforward physics and short thematictracks; Team Sonic Racing has iffyphysics and long tracks with little to no discernible themes. Sonic Drift Racing this is not indeed — and I don’t quite like what it is.  Saviors of Sapphire Wings / Stranger ofSword City: Two ExperienceInc. FPDCs for the price of one! How did we get so lucky? Seriously though, I’moverjoyed. I’ve wanted to play the former — known inJapan as Students of the Round — sincemy fellow gamer and blogger Kina wrote a series of mouth-watering posts about it; as for the latter, I’ve wanted to play it since I purchased the Vitaversion. Yup, I bought SoSC twice,and I’m not even salty about it. Take my money, Experience Inc! Nexomon – Extinction: If that game were a person, I would dropeverything in a heartbeat to follow them to the end of the world. These lushgraphics! These vibrant colours! Those adorable starters! That heart-warmingatmosphere! This is too much! Mygamer’s heart is throbbing with giddiness and happiness, and I just cannot waitto go back to NE for good.    Vambrace – Cold Soul: Did someone say ‘winter theme’? I’m sold!Seriously though, that game has atmosphere in spades and a promising gameplay,and my gaming instinct wants more of it.  KILL la KILL – IF: The anime piqued my interest back in the days,but let’s be honest: I’m not an anime aficionado, and I’ll probably never watchit. On the other hand, I can get the next best thing: a brawler featuring the KlaK crew and a piece of story! Andsince that particular brawler boasts some particularly stellar physics andgorgeous graphics, I’d be crazy not to indulge in it.   I am Setsuna: I’m a complete and total sucker for wintry & snowy settings andatmosphere — so of course, I had to have a complete and total crush on Setsuna. The fighting system ain’t half- bad either, and thecrawling is promising — really, no complaints at all here.  Kowloon High-School Chronicles: I expected a Point&click with strong VN elements, taking placein a modern Korean setting. What I got instead was a first-person dungeoncrawler with a strong emphasis on puzzles — and a much unexpected Egyptiantemple setting. I was too disoriented by that mighty plot twist to sort out myimmediate feelings about KHSC; butI’ll be damned if I don’t give every FPDC that crosses my path its fair chanceto shine.   Moero Crystal H: It’s moreof the same delightfully bonkers and risqué GenkaiToki fare — only better than in Moe Chronicles. We have smoother roaming in better-looking dungeons with a morebalanced encounter rate, faster and more efficient fighting — and maybe flashiercharacter designs? We’ll see —because that game is here to stay!   Okami HD: A PS2 and Wii cultclassic that’s been ported to new machines over time — yet somehow nevermanaged to be a commercial hit despite garnering critical acclaim. I’ve wantedto try that game for years; yet now that the deed is done, I’m a bitunderwhelmed. Is it the weird, stiff camera angles? Is it the ever-so-slightlyclunky controls? Is it the fact that we’re dealing with a 6thgeneration game that maybe didn’t age gracefully? Or is Okami just a half-baked game, all style and no substance, thatsomehow managed to fool reviewers into granting it their eternal blessing? Idon’t know, and I certainly won’t start a debate here. What I know is that Okami left no imprint in my gamer’ssoul, and that I don’t feel the slightest desire to touch it again.   Diablo III – Eternal Collection: I had to try the king,the boss, the granddaddy of Hack’n’slashes sooner or later; and heck, Diablo III didn’t disappoint at all.Super-addictive combat, pitch-perfect physics, gorgeous graphics, atmosphere inspades — I’m yours, game!  Trials of Mana: Oh heck no. Trials of Mana is another one of these Seiken Densetsu remakes that completely squandered the original’sappeal in the process. No RPG series is defined and identified by its art styleas much as Seiken Densetsu; removethat signature art style, and you obtain a game that is not quite an SD game. And even if I turned a blindeye to the butchering of the SDcharm, I couldn’t turn another blind eye to the poor pacing, the lifelessenvironments and the overabundance of cutscenes.  Collection of Mana: Nowwe’re talking, Squeenix. I never played MysticQuest or Secret of Mana, and thatcollection is the perfect opportunity to do! As for Seiken Densetsu 3… look, I booted the game; and I just cannot describe the wave of sheer,intense nostalgia that crashed over me upon hearing the music and seeing thecharacter selection screen. I know I wrote a slightly critical post about it 8years ago, but man… If the firstscreen alone can elicit such powerful feels, maybe I’ll play it again afterall. Actually, I didn’t say I would neverreplay it back in 2014, did I?   Rune Factory 4 Special: Ihave a long and convoluted history with this game. Rewind all the way to 2014,when we learnt that Europe wouldn’t be granted a physical release of RF4. I didn’t buy digital games at thetime; yet I wanted to play that one, badly.That desire prompted me to cross the Rubicon and have a second-hand North-American3DS and a physical copy of RF4 crossthe friggin’ Atlantic Ocean, rightinto my greedy paws. Having gone to such lengths to secure a single game, youwould think I’d play it right away, wouldn’t you? Heck, no! I left it untouched for the next 8 years, until I finallydecided to get rid of it in favour of the Switch version. The ultimate ironywould have been to hate RF4 rightfrom the first second of play; but fortunately, I was actually hooked, andeager to play more.   Dragon Quest XI – Echoes of an ElusiveAge: Let’s be honest, I was sold upon seeingthe first frames of the retro mode. Full-force gaming fernweh for the win!"},
{"title": "The New Classics Sessions: Switch, Session 2", "date": "24/01/2023", "text": "Shantae – Half-Genie Hero: The physics are tight and solid enough, whileremaining simple and intuitive. Add to this a zesty atmosphere, all brightcolours and funny animations, and you get a Platformer that’s tailor-made forlittle me.  Bayonetta 2: Wow! Just wow, seriously.The most badass, stylish and drop-dead gorgeous protagonist of them all,physics so stellar they might as well be the Milky Way, and sleek animationsand camera angles that make you feel like you’re a friggin’ anime character orDC movie hero. What more can you ask for? Well, just more.   Persona 5 Strikers: The impossibly loveable Persona 5 crew and a kickass Hack’n’Slash fighting system? Don’tsay more, I’m sold. Or more like: I’myour b*tch, game!   Moonlighter: The setting is quite dreary, and the controls are pretty clunky andunintuitive. I could probably master them with practice — but I have nodesire to do so when games with better controls are already comfortably nestedin The Collection.   Bladed Fury: Any Hack’n’slash featuring a tight, intuitive and overall excellentfighting system is bound to please me; and a Hack’n’slash that allows suspended mid-air slashing deserves myeternal love and gratefulness. The awesome atmosphere is a bonus, and one I’llcertainly enjoy.    Trails of Cold Steel IV: Same overall atmosphere and fighting system as ToCS III. I accepted III into The Collection, and so I’llaccept IV as well. And hey, did Ispot Estelle and Joshua in the first battle? Nice to see these two together,and to handle them again!   Oninaki: Combine a unique, ethereal atmosphere with a tight real-timefighting system, and you’re sure to have a hit with me. Nuff said!  Zengeon: A cute little Hack’n’slash that is serviceable, yet not stellar — and didn’t manage to touch my gamer’s soul. Since I have tons of better Hack’n’slashes inThe Collection, Zengeon has togo.    Atelier Lulua – The Scion of Arland: The Arland brand of alchemy isn’t my favourite;however, Lulua’s world is simply too enchantingto give that game a pass. I wanna roam these splendid crystalline pastel zones,until my retinas explode with happiness!   Atelier Ryza – Ever Darkness & theSecret Hideout: I love Ryza’s sassinessand looks, I love the vibrant aesthetics, I love the Myst-like ambiance — in a nutshell, I lovethat new atmosphere, which is a distinct departure from the ethereal vibe atwork in the series since the Arland days. However… something just doesn’t click. I don’t know what theproblem is; I just know I cannot get into that game despite liking everythingabout it, and thus I must give it a pass.  Atelier Ryza 2 – Lost Legends & theSecret Fairy: Same baseelements and mood as in the first Ryza; but this time around, it inexplicably works better — it works, full stop. Is it the whole ‘loneranger roaming the world to pursue a personal quest’ theme, which I’m a suckerfor? Is it the glorious, sun-kissed, bustling city that serves as the game’sprimary hub, and which reminds me of Barcelona — one of my favourite citiesever — for some reason? I don’t know; but one thing I do know is that Ryza 2 ishere to stay."},
{"title": "The New Classics Sessions: Switch, Session 1", "date": "23/01/2023", "text": "Gun Gun Pixies: It’s cute, zesty and full of humorous vibes;however, it’s not nearly memorable and thrilling enough to join The Collection.Plus, it involves stealth gameplay, and the beast I am doesn’t dig suchsubtlety.   Shin Megami Tensei III – Nocturne: Not gonna lie, the early stages were verypromising in terms of atmosphere. However, this is a canon MegaTen game, featuring canon MegaTengameplay — which Idon’t fancy, as we know now.   Fire Emblem – Three Houses: Oh lord, Ilove it! I do! Fast battles!Great atmosphere! Gorgeous character designs! Gimme more! Somehow, it seems the only SRPG series I can not onlytolerate, but also enjoy in earnest is FireEmblem — and well,that’s mighty fine by me.  Cadence of Hyrule: I love the pristine graphics, the remixed musicand the vibrant atmosphere; however, the rhythm thing ruined all the fun forme. Mind you, you don’t actually have to move to the beat of the music;but not doing so feels so tedious and disjointed that it’s basically pointless. Off with yer head, mate!  Little Dragons Café: Too slow, too clunky, too handholdy — and last but not least, plagued with a hellish amount of loadingtimes. If I want some clunky, hard-to-tame shop owner simulation game, I’drather roll with my beloved HometownStory, which comes with sweet memories on top.  Fairy Fencer F – Advent Dark Force: Great dungeon crawling, fast and thrillingfighting, and a certain je ne sais quoi thatmakes me wanna get more of it. You’re in, buddy!  Megadimension Neptunia VII: HN isand will always be my jam; and I love that entry’s wider, more openenvironments. It’s pretty obvious that MNVIIwas primarily designed for a home console, and I won’t miss that opportunity todiscover a new take on the HN formula— all the less so as dungeon roaming is thrilling andfighting is as intoxicating as evah.  Caladrius Blaze: Eye-popping colours and flashy effects up thewazoo, tight and responsive controls and exhilarating music; I really don’tneed more in my shmups!    Fate/Extella Link: I knew I was dealing with a game packing strongVN elements; I was thus mightily surprised to start the game (bar skippedcutscenes) with an epic fighting scene that would totally feel at home in a musou game. Well, who am I to say no tosome sweet hack’n’slashing? ^^ Plus, the crew is dressed to kill, and I wannasee more of that. And who knows, thestory may even be amazing!  Bravely Default II: I played the demo first and didn’t quite enjoyit; but when I tried playing the actual game, I had a really nice time andwanted to keep playing. I’ll chalk this up to the fact that the demo doesn’tshow the beginning of the game, but rather some kind of faux save file thatmakes you feel like you’re playing someone else’s Switch. I don’t like that,but this is the Squeenix way; and since I liked the real thing, I’ll hold ontoit."},
{"title": "The New Classics: Progress Report #4", "date": "22/01/2023", "text": "As promised, here comes my first 2023 weekly progress report for themighty New Classic Project! Can you feel the hype, dear fellow gamers? BecauseI sure can. I spent the whole week putting games to the (New Classic) test, andit was awesome. Ah, to play like the wind again, with my gaming instinct as thesole compass! Before we dive into that new report, here are links to my first,second and third progress report, in case you may want to refresh your memory.  And now, let’s ride! I’ll tell you a little secret: I hardly playedanything between late august and last week-end. Namely: my four X&Yruns, a bit of Persona 5 Royal, a bit of NieR Automata, and afull Pokemon Violet run (posts to come about the latter). That gamingdeprivation was mostly the result of unfavourable circumstances best left in2022; what matters, though, is that it ultimately proved very fruitful. Mygaming instinct is now sharper and more astute than ever, and can passjudgement on a game within minutes, with no fear or doubt.   That newfound acuity coincides with a shift in the New Classic focus. Myinitial goal was to find my own cult classics, games I could adore and replayfor all eternity; then I realised that some games I adored could beonce-in-a-lifetime experiences. And thus comes my revamped goal: to spot thegames I really want to play — once, or a million times.  That sounds like a no-brainer of a goal; but let’s face it, I had toovercome a number of roadblocks to reach such a level of clarity andconfidence. I got rid of my gaming FOMO, I put to rest the fear of scarcityinherited from my early gaming years, I eradicated the sunk-cost fallacy andthe need to recoup all my gaming investments, I reined in my tendency to over-adaptand ‘find some good’ in every single game; and most importantly, I learnt totrust my gaming instinct, fully and completely.   With that new focus come two adjustments: — Puzzlegames à la Professor Layton are now officially out of the New Classicoperation. The reason is simple: although I’ve never, ever been disappointed bya puzzle game, I’ve also never, ever felt the need to replay a single one ofthem once the deed was done. From now on, all puzzle games are ‘games I wannaplay once’ — and I’m gonna play them for sure, and pawn them once I’m done.  — VNs andotomes will get the New Classic treatment as well, contrary to what I announcedin the early stages of the operation. Over time, I’ve come to realise that myliking a given VN/otome has an awful lot to do with its atmosphere. Ifit clicks with me, I’m sure to have a great time, no matter how half-baked thestory is; if not, I’m in for a crappy ride, no matter how excellent the storyis. As a rule, I envision VNs and otomes as breathers; and when I decide to getmyself such a breather, I wanna know what to expect. It’s thus perfectlylogical to apply the New Classic treatment to all my VNs and otomes. I’lldedicate a special session to these games, and go over all of them at once, regardlessof their host system.   As for the current state of affairs: I’m proud to announce that my wholecurrent Switch collection has been put to the New Classic test! I’m currently going through my 3DS collection, and progressingfast; you’ll get the reports in due time — namely, once I’m done unleashing mySwitch reports onto the world. Said unleashing will follow that report; I’llwrap things up with a celebratory post of sorts, and I’ll do the same for everysub-collection once I’m done with it.  But wait,I hear you say; isn’t the New Classic operation still a work in progress as faras the Switch is concerned? Yeah, about that… As unlikely as it may sound, I’mcurrently not feeling the slightest need to purchase new Switch releases. Icannot promise it won’t happen at some point this year; but for now, my gaminginstinct is dead-set on the New Classic operation and doesn’t feel likepursuing new titles. That’sall for that 4th New Classic Progress Report, dear fellow gamers! The companionposts will follow in the next days, and I’ll see you next week with my 5th report.Take care, and keep doing your thing! ^^"},
{"title": "The New Classics #72: NieR: Automata – The End of YoRHa", "date": "21/01/2023", "text": "The backstory: I would lieif I claimed I’m a fan of Yoko Taro’s universe and themes de predilection;on the other hand, I can safely claim I’ve always wanted to play Drakengardand NieR. So, imagine my joy when NieR: Automata suddenly poppedup on the Switch! I swear, that console made so many of my port&remakedreams come true that I’ll soon build a shrine to it. Maybe Drakengardwill grace the Switch on day as well? (Insert twinkling, starry eyes)  The game: Anybody whoplayed NA knows that it starts with an in medias res introductionthat lasts roughly one hour. You cannot save during that intro; on the otherhand, you get to fight and explore a lot, before the game wraps things up withan epic boss fight. Then, you’re sent to the main hub, and to the game per se.   I couldsay that this intro is one of the best video game introductions I’ve everplayed, and that would be totally true. But that’s not all: that one-hoursequence is actually one of the best games I’ve ever played.   Look: I’mgonna spill my guts here, and I’m gonna spill them hard. NA’sintro awed me all the way through with its grandiose vistas, its masterfullyhandled cinematography, the very scope of its game world. I felt reverence,wonderment, astonishment, and all sorts of raw emotions I cannot put into words. I gaped atthe screen, I squealed in delight; I shook with fear, I shivered withexcitement; I beamed, I teared up — and I felt sheer joy, from beginningto end. There were times I was utterly in control, bristling with power; andthere were times I was overwhelmed, facing my own lack of skill and prowess —and both feelings were amazing. Never before did I feel such an intense,complete immersion in a game world; never before did I feel so much that I wasthe MC, that the game world was real. It doesn’t matter that I onlytouched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to mastering the controls: I was fullythere, body and soul, alone with the game and my feelings — heck, I was thegame.   Do youthink this paean is a complete emotional mess, dear fellow gamers? I totallyagree. NA’s introduction did things to me; it roused my gamer’ssoul in a way no other game ever did, and awoke emotions I had never feltbefore while playing.   I wasstill basking in these glorious emotions when I cleared the intro and accessedthe main hub. I saved there, and kept playing. Then, something mighty weirdhappened: I enjoyed myself less. That magic I felt during the introduction wasgone, and gameplay suddenly felt more… tedious, somehow. Not only that, but Iexperienced my first Game Over!   So, whathappened? I honestly don’t know. Maybe NA is a game tailored for short playingsessions; after all, its gameplay is quite demanding, and can be taxing despitebeing immensely fulfilling. It could also be the fact that while NA’sintroduction is quite linear, its first core section is much more open,requiring more exploration and finding one’s way. It could also be that thecore game is actually harder than the intro — I mean, why else would Ihave landed a Game Over?   I’ll letyou on a little secret: I was initially planning to play the whole thing in onego after my immense crush on the intro, writing raving posts as I went on. However,my experience with NA’s first core session made me reconsider. And so, Ijust wrote that New Classic post about it; and I’m gonna leave it at that fornow.     The verdict: I’ve notplayed enough to pass a fair judgement on Nier: Automata’s coregameplay, so I’ll abstain until further play. I know one thing for sure,though: I absolutely adored the introduction, and I consider it afull-blown game. I mean, it has a narrative arc, a game world, plenty ofrunning around and fighting, a middle boss and an epic final boss — I don’tneed more in me RPG, folks! That introduction alone is worth replaying over andover, and is enough to grant NA a spot in The Collection — regardless ofmy future feelings about the rest of the game. That’s a pretty weird situation,I must admit; but the gaming instinct wants what it wants, baby!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #71: Persona 5 Royal", "date": "20/01/2023", "text": "The backstory: Rewind allthe way to summer 2019: I received Persona Q2 – New Cinema Labyrinth in themail, and proceeded to play it fresh off the wrapping. I had oodles offun despite a few setbacks, and vowed to play the original Persona 5 on PS3. Fast-forward to late 2022: Persona 5 Royal is gracing the Switch, to universal acclaim; andit’s lounging in my Switch spot, hopefully for many hours to come.    The game: I knew thatrecent Persona games were story-heavyaffairs; however, I hadn’t anticipated that the cutcenes/gameplay ratio wouldbe so skewed in favour of the former. I got to fight a grand total of threebattles in thirty minutes of play, and had to sit through a mountain ofcutscenes of various lengths to reach these three fights. Sure enough, someRPGs won’t even let you fight at allduring their introduction sequence; and obviously, P5R will let me fight more at some point. However, this is the NewClassic era: and stuff like ‘not so bad’, ‘could be worse’ and ‘will get betterlater’ don’t cut it anymore.    Granted, P5R is not all about battles, and thereare other gameplay elements in the early stages; however, these gameplayelements don’t qualify as worth playing as far as I’m concerned. Running frompoint A to point B while being interrupted by cutscenes is not my idea of fungameplay; and I swear I nearly threw a hissy fit — and my Switch through thewindow — when the game asked me to commute.As in, ‘go to school using public transportation, and change lines while you’reat it’. Are you friggin’ kidding me, Atlus? Now, excuse my French — but I docommute IRL, and that’s the last bloody thing I wanna do in a darn video game.   Sureenough, I was glad to be reacquainted with P5R’ssplendid character design, and with its flashy, slightly campy aesthetics; butthat is honestly not enough to keep me hooked. I’m thinking that I might aswell purchase the official art book if I wanna feast my eyes on the P5 crew on a regular basis.   The verdict: I cannot goagainst my gaming instinct: although I’ve been pinning for P5R for three years, I ultimately don’t like it. That’s slightlydisturbing, and I’m honestly a bit sad; but I won’t dwell on it. For one, thereare plenty of other great games out there; for another, I still have Persona 5 Strikers to try, and thusanother chance to handle the P5 crew!Now, this raises another burning question: is the canon Persona series even for me at all? That’s something I’m gonna haveto verify, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #70: Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late [cl-r]", "date": "19/01/2023", "text": "The Backstory: Here is a game that’s been tweaked, updated and rereleased on a slewof platforms since its arcade debut in 2012 — leadingto that stupidly long title, no doubt. It seems to come from the same mold as GuiltyGear and BlazBlue: a 2D fighting game / visual novel hybrid,featuring a crap ton of impossibly stylish characters with outlandishbackstories that beg to be uncovered as you kick butts. My Samurai Showdowndays left me with a soft spot for fancy characters and not-too-technicalfighting, and I fully expected to have a field day with UNIB (there’s noway I’m typing that darn title again, ever).   The Game: Endless tweaking of UNIB brought more than a barely writabletitle, fortunately. The amount of playing mode is staggering, and guaranteesthat you can punch it your way no matter what. Local online, worldwideonline, offline; score attack, time attack, training mode, regular arcade modewith story, single match in a selected location — you just have it all, and the playing possibilities are virtuallyendless.   And that’s without even factoring in the wholeposse of fighters, folks! Of course, they all look drop-dead gorgeous, and theyall come with their own unique set of skills, strengths and weaknesses — and glorious fighting poses and animations to boot. You can bet your arse I’m gonna try andmaster every single one of them, just like I did with the SamuraiShodown IV roster back in the days.   Shameless eye-candy is all well and good, but howdoes the butt-kicking fare? Pretty darn well indeed. UNIB is obviouslydesigned for casual players, who want to enjoy some frantic ass-kicking withoutspending hours mastering the technicalities of a fighting system. I have nodoubt that UNIB fights can get pretty deep and technical in the righthands; but they also work perfectly at base level —read: in the lazy hands of a fightinggame noob like me playing in easy mode against the CPU.  The Verdict: No surprise here, we have a New Classic! I’m sad no more UNIB gamesexist; on the other hand, BlazBlue is waiting, with a crap ton of gamesreleased on systems I own. Happy butt-kicking days ahead, yay!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #69: Darksiders Genesis", "date": "18/01/2023", "text": "The Backstory: The whole Darksiders series was recently ported to the Switch,allowing us portable aficionados to discover it at long last. I was drawn in bythe lush graphics and the Hack’n’slashy gameplay; and while I managed to resistthe urge to purchase all four entries at once, I sure hoped that my experiencewith Genesis would prompt such a purchase.  The Game: That’s a gorgeous game allright, full of vibrant colours and lovelydetails. That being said, it’s also very obviously a game that was designed forhome consoles and PCs — in other words, for fat, widescreens. The MC sprite occupies the tiniest part of the screen — a screen that,in the Switch Lite’s case, is not that huge to begin with. I have top-notch eyesight,and yet I found myself bothered by that lilliputian sprite.   I could have gotten used to it, mind you; but other things botheredme as well. Things such as the confusing layout, which had me going in circles,or the MC’s speed, which was a little too low for my taste and made crossingareas a chore rather than a thrill. Talking about this, the ratio between thesize of environments and the size of the MC sprite is way too skewed in favourof the former for my taste. Also, enemies are too few and far between, meaningthat you spend too much time running around and trying to find your way and notenough time hacking and slashing.   The Verdict: Although I was really intrigued at first, it dawned on me after abit of playing that I was simply not enjoying myself after all. I’m a bitdisappointed, because Genesis has a lot of things going for it; however,not all is lost. The things that bother me in Genesis may be absent fromits predecessors; and so, I will check other Darksiders entries beforeswearing off the whole series — and by ‘check’, I meanstudy them through pictures, gameplay videos and reviews, and commit to apurchase if I like what I find. Greedy little me is becoming sensible, hooray!"},

I can't stick to a self-inflicted stringent schedule ; but I do very well in a morerelaxed format.

If I don’t manage tocreate the site myself during that time, I’ll simply enrol a professional. — Regardingthe New Classics: I’ll post a progress report every week, alongside gamereviews. That routine will start next weekend; until then, I’ll deliver acouple of remaining posts from last year.  That’sall I have to say for now, dear fellow gamers.

{"title": "The New Classics #68: Psyvariar Delta", "date": "21/12/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Psyvariar — now that’s a weird series if I ever saw one. The word ‘series’ is noteven relevant, as we’re dealing with a single game that’s been revised andexpanded over the years since its initial release in 2000. Psyvariar Deltais no exception, as it’s still the same old game repackaged with various enhancements.Not that I care that we’re dealing with a rehash, mind you; the only thing thatmatters to me is whether P-Delta is worthy of joining The Collection.  The Game: Okay, now. P-Delta looks amazing, with only the faintest hintof phone game plastic-ness — but the bright colours arehere, and so is the flurry of neon bullets and laser beams. It plays veryneatly as well, with solid physics, fulfilling speed and a delightful splash ofbullet hell frenzy. It could have been a perfect shooter in my eyes — and hands— if not for one glaring, deal-breaking detail: the god-forsaken player interface.  Why, Success? What compelled you tosqueeze all that eye-popping, frantic action into such a ridiculously tinydisplay — a mere rectangle that barely amounts to one third of the Switch’sscreen, with both sides occupied by pointless crap? I don’t care that this is aclassic, tried-and-tested display style for vertical arcade shooters; we’re notdealing with an arcade cabinet, but with a Switch screen that begs to befully exploited.  As a result of that choice, the bullet hell sections become a realchore, an exercise in frustration, claustrophobia and gritted teeth. The lasttime I felt constrained by a screen was when I played my Game Boy back in thedays — needless to say, that’s not something I was eager to experience again.   The Verdict: No surprise here, Psyvariar Delta is no New Classic of mine.I have enough stellar Shoot’em ups already to dispense with the ones that are,well, less than stellar. Guess I’ll have to find my bullet hell heaven inanother shooter!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #67: Legend of Mana", "date": "17/12/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Way back in 1999, Legend of Mana marked the series’ move tothe PSX — and toSony’s pastures — after three back-to-back entries released on Nintendo systems in amere five years. LoM also marked theseries’ first incursion into spinoff territory —ironic, knowing that the original Seiken Densetsu game wasmarketed as a Final Fantasy spinoff — and thus into new, unchartedgameplay. I would never have played that game if not for the 2021 Switch remake— now, is that a good or a bad thing?  The Game: LoM is not as, well, legendary as Secret of Mana andSeiken Densetsu 3. This is not due to a loss of the Managraphical style or atmosphere — which was at its strongest in that first PSX entry — but rather to thedisconcerting new gameplay. Many critics at the time panned the gameplay’s lackof focus, and the absence of a ‘red thread’ that made the whole experiencecohesive and fulfilling.    You’d have thought that Squeenix would fix thatlack of direction in the remake — all the more so as itseems to have been the original’s only real flaw. But if what I’ve played isany indication, Squeenix didn’t fix jack sh*t. Worse, they didn’t eventry to alleviate the gameplay’s looseness by, say, squeezing in a handytutorial that could allow unsuspecting players to grasp the game’s logic. So,you can tell the player to use the left stick to move in FFXII, but youcannot guide them through the first uber-nebulous stages of LoM? Gimme adarn break, Squeenix.  Mind you, I tried to play the thing. I ranaround in the first town, talked to people, and apparently nailed a quest andan ally; then I wanted to go fulfil said quest, and couldn’t figure out whereto go. Look, game: I’m really trying, but you have to do your part — like, let me play you.   The Verdict: If there is one thing I despise more than a game bristling withhandholdy tutorials, it’s definitely a game that plays all coy and hard-to-getand expects me to move heaven and earth to penetrate its arcane gameplay. Look,b*tch: I literally  have hundreds of games at my fingertips, and I’m not gonnalose precious hours of my life with a game that so obviously doesn’t want to beplayed."},
{"title": "The New Classics #66: Pawarumi", "date": "14/12/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Pawarumi doesn’t have its own Wikipedia page, but isroutinely described as a “modern Shoot’em up set in a retro futuristic sci-fipre-Columbian universe”. It’s also the main work of Manufacture 43, ateeny-tiny French developer based in Bordeaux, home of other indie game studiossuch as Motion Twin (of Dead Cells fame) and Asobo Studio. Manufacture43 cleverly teamed up with publisher EastAsiaSoft to release 2000 physicalcopies of the Switch version — one of them headed to my precious collection.   The Game: Pawarumi is a generous Shoot’em up that gives you a lot towreak havoc with: three types of weapons, each as deadly and flashy as thenext. There seems to be a clever colour combination system that can grant youbenefits, but I’ll admit it: I was too busy shooting at stuff to pay attention.   I was also very busy gazing at the splendidvistas, which are the most beautiful and evocative ones I’ve flown through thisside of G-Darius HD. In fact, the whole game is splendid: from thehighly geometric and choreographed formations to your ships’ supremely stylishlaser beams, everything in Pawarumi is a feast for the eyes. Add to allthis eye-candy some perfect physics, smooth and speedy at the same time — and nearly liquid in their slickness — and you get thecrème de la crème of Switch Shoot’em ups.   The Verdict: Not gonna play it all patriotic here, but the French sure know how tocraft some good sh*t when they want it! Also, Pawarumi is most definitely a New Classic of mine — can’t wait to discover more of that French-madeNeo-Aztec goodness!"},
{"title": "Pokemon X&Y: The 2022 Solo Runs", "date": "11/12/2022", "text": "Did you think I had missed my usual summer round of X&Ysolo runs, dear fellow gamers? No way! I played them alright, and they were ablast. I racked up no less than four back-to-back runs in September, for atally of roughly 50 hours. I didn’t write about them in due time, as I wasstarting a new job that absorbed most of my time and energy; and unfortunately,I currently don’t remember enough about these runs to write individual postsabout them. But I still wanna make a run report of sorts; and so, I’m gonnalump all them together here, and deliver whatever I can remember about them.   Carbink: I honestlyexpected the worst from that cute little rock. I mean, a Rock/Fairynon-evolving ‘Mon, with high defensive stats and passable everything else? Why,that sounds like a sure recipe for solo run hell! But surprise surprise, my Crystallinedidn’t struggle all that much. Sure enough, I needed a little help from BattleItems and Ancient Power from time to time; but overall, Carbink turned out tobe a pretty reliable lone ranger. This is the Boldore and Pachirisu story allover again, where a seemingly crippled ‘Mon proves to be a force to be reckonedwith — and man, I never get bored of such plot twistsin my solo runs.  Clawitzer: As a bornSpecial Attacker with well-rounded other stats, that crustacean ‘Mon is perfectsolo material. Add to this a kickass, near-exclusive learnset and anability that strengthens said learnset, and you get a perfect weapon of ‘Mondestruction. No surprise here: with Moves in the +80 Power range and a SpecialAttack boosted by her Mild Nature, my Water Cannon obliterated thecompetition. Also, did you know that Dragon is weak to Dragon? I sure didn’tknow that, and it was sweet as heck to discover it while spamming Dragon Pulseat the Elite Four showdown.   Dragalge: Poison/Dragon—now that is a seriously interesting combination, with somestellar design to boot. Stats distribution is a bit weird, but didn’t hinder mein the slightest—Dragalge packs a punch despite being a slow defense-oriented‘Mon. I mean, my Coral Reef boasted a respectable 192 Attack by the endof my run, despite her Bold Nature! Factor in Poison Point and a stellarlearnset, and you get some darn good solo run material.  Gogoat: You know, Ialways love when a Grass ‘Mon is blessed with sky-high HP and offensive stats.I love it even more when said Grass ‘Mon looks as cute as Skiddo and asbadass as Gogoat. Seriously: the latter now stands proudly in my Gen VI Top Five.Took me long enough to run with it, but that was worth the wait! Great looks, high Attack and Sp.Attack, and a varied and destructive learnset: Gogoat ticks allthe boxes to qualify for perfect solo run material, and my BK wreakedhavoc through Kalos. In case you’re wondering about that name: BK sounds a lotlike “biquet”, a French word that means kid—asin, a little goat. I’m quite proud of that one, honestly ^^   My summer rendezvous with X&Y have been going on for sevenyears now; at that point, I’ve probably played the pair enough already for alifetime. I’m not done yet, though! For once, there are still a number of Kalos‘Mons I wanna run solo with—I have my eye on ya,Hawlucha, Dedenne, Goodra, Aromatisse, Doublade and Noivern. Then, I might wantto reacquaint myself with with Gen VI favourites of mine, such as Meowstic; andon top of that, I can always very much cruise Kalos with ‘Mons from other Gens.Long story short: Kalos and Gen VI ain’tgoing nowhere, and my love for X&Y burns as bright as ever!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #65: Streets of Rage 4 ", "date": "10/12/2022", "text": "The Backstory: I didn’t play the second, nor did I play the third; but the veryfirst Streets of Rage was a major highlight of my childhood andteenage gaming years — so of course I had to buythat unhoped-for Switch entry!   The Game: Back in the days, Blaze was the go-to character: she was fast, shejumped high, and she was hawt to book — allthings that perfectly compensated her lack of punching power. Things aredifferent now: not only because Blaze has been rebalanced in SoR4,making her a bit less OP, but also because my fingers are not as nimble as backthen and I cannot bear to mash buttons for hours. Axel thus became my newgo-to character, a powerhouse that can reduce the number of button inputs — andthe strain on my fingers. Just like Blaze’s, his redesign is awesome, givinghim a faux air of Chris Hemsworth’s Thor. I’ll probably try all characters indue time, once I get reacquainted to SoR’s brand of fighting.  Said brand of fighting involves two enduring points, which werealready at work in the original game and are still alive and well in thatfourth entry. For one, it’s easier to scour the eponymous streets of rage witha fellow player than on your own; for another, fighting is highly technicalbehind its apparent simplicity, and you can soon fight yourself overwhelmed ifyou’re not fast enough and/or if you don’t master the controls. I’ll admit it:without its (blessed) save system, SoR4 would be too frustrating for me.Young me could spend whole afternoons trying to reach Mr. X, but older me hasplenty of other things to do — and is thus perfectly fine with being able toplay one level of SoR4 and come back to it the next day.   Despite the 29 years between them, SoR4 feels and plays a lotlike the original SoR. It wasn’t long before all my SoRautomatisms came back to the surface — grabbing foes from behind, landing onyour feet while being thrown in the air, jump-kicking, you name it. The gamecleverly opens on a recreation of SoR’s first level — those gritty,dirty streets, which are just as iconic to a SoR fan as Green Hillto a Sonic fan — yet quickly enriches the experience by adding nifty,atmospheric new elements such as a subway wagon.  As for the novelties, they’re mostly on the cute,cosmetic side — but not only. You can now choose what kind of food you’ll find lying around — I had to pick up croissants, obviously — as well as access brand-newspecial attacks and combos. And then you have the missing elements, which areno less important than the new ones. Gone is the possibility to call yourfellow coppers to clear the way; and I was pretty miffed not to findmulticoloured Noras strutting their stuff and cracking their whips.   The Verdict: Sure, Streets of Rage cannot be as cultish to me as it usedto be; but I’ll be damned if I don’t hold onto that fourth entry and make themost of it. I’m sure the game has plenty of nifty surprises in store for me — and hey, I need a good Beat’em up in my collection anyway!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #64: Ys IX – Monstrum Nox", "date": "05/12/2022", "text": "The Backstory: The Ys series has been running for a staggering 35 years, onmore platforms than you can count. Although they’ve always been ARPGs, theformula has been tweaked over time — you’d be hard-pressed to find anything close tothe good old ‘bump attack’ system in recent entries. On the other hand, mysteriousand demure Adol Christin is still there — although he’sgetting more talkative as games go by. Anyway, we’re in for a major stretch, asthe last (and only) Ys entries I played are the 7thgeneration remakes of the first two episodes. Will the gameplay change be toomuch to bear, or will I slide effortlessly into modern Ys?   The Game: Skippable cutscenes and in medias res introduction that lets youplay right off the bat always make for a great combo. So do stellar physics anda slick fighting system that includes the genre’s best staples (tweakable aiming that automatically transfers to the next foe,variety of attacks and combos) as well as some neat novelties (a ‘zapping’feature that brings you right next to a faraway foe, to mention the one I coulduncover during my limited playtime).  Indeed, a good chunk of Ys IX’s gameplay is based on usingthe various abilities of your posse of characters to your advantage. Becauseindeed — again — you don’t solely handle good old Adol Christin, but rather sixdifferent characters you can switch between. From what I understand, that newplaystyle was introduced in Ys VIII, and is hailed as the series’ best thingsince bumping attack by some fans and as absolute rubbish by others. As for me,I don’t care either way — as long as I can slash at stuff, I’m good!   Talking about slashing at stuff, I couldn’t do it nearly as much asI wanted. After that glorious intro that let me claw my way out of a sordidprison, I was introduced to a slew of cutscenes and some quieter gameplay bitsinvolving exploration and item-finding, and… it was kinda boring. Still, I playedthese bits and skipped cutscenes like it was going out of fashion; next thing Iknew, I was thrown into a hectic battle with a bunch of CPU-controlled allies. Icould barely spot Adol amidst all that chaos, and… it wasn’t really fun.    The Verdict: As much as it pains me to admit it, Ys IX is no New Classicof mine. Bar the initial bout of dungeon-crawling, I had no fun playing it; andnothing about it feels moreish. I cannot lie to myself —but I don’t have to either; as I said, I don’t have to love every singleinstalment of every single series!"},

Notonly does it feature distinctive character art by Satoshi Urushihara, who wasubiquitous at the time, but it also had its heyday on a slew of 16-bit and32-bit platforms, from the Megadrive to the Saturn —without forgetting incursions on the Super Famicom and the PC Engine. I knewnothing of Langrisser before remakes of the first two entries popped upon the 3DS and the Switch; but being the greedy curious gamer I am, Iobviously had to give it a go.  The Game: Well, curiosity kills the cat sometimes —and empties the wallet. Look, I’m not gonna beat around the bush: I knew rightaway that things were not going to work. This is an archaic SRPG that evenupdated character art and a thick layer of phone-gamey shine cannot makeenjoyable to my finicky palate. It’s slow as heck and complicated to boot; andwhile I have no doubt that an SRPG aficionado with a perverse taste for retrowill lap it up, I couldn’t bring myself to even finish the first battle.  The Verdict: Well, that was fast! Instant dislike of a game can be a thingindeed, just like instant love. More time saved for potential New Classics,hooray!"},

Let’s find out if that newest Axe will become aNew Classic of mine, shall we?   The Game: I went straight for Easy Mode, because I like my Hack’n’Slashes onthe cushy, fulfilling side — especially when they’reretro. The metallic, gritty Megadrivey music grated on my ears and was quicklyshut down, leaving me free to concentrate on the gorgeous 16-bit-ish graphics —think Seiken Densetsu 3, only with smoother edges and softer hues.   As for the gameplay, it’s the most deliciously regressive piece of bloodymessiness I’ve seen this side of Mortal Combat. Geysers of blood!Explosions of fleshy bits! All this at the slightest touch from your sword!I’ve never been one to relish gore in a game; but such cartoonish, over-the-topgore is right up my alley.   B-Axe can be as short or as long as youwant, which is also right up my alley. You can go for a quick carnage fix bypolishing off the four levels of the Arcade Mode, or treat yourself to anall-you-can-eat buffet by diving into the Infinite Mode and its virtuallyendless string of levels.    The Verdict: Gory retro goodness is totally something I can use — all the more so as there is nothing quite like Battle Axein The Collection.

I had to secure that thing of beauty; and after unpacking it anddiscovering all the high-quality feelies included, I was more than eager to seeif the game itself was as much of a gorgeous work of love.  The Game: For once, I didn’t mourn the fact that the introduction sequence isnot skippable — because HLD’s intro is simply one of the most mesmerizing preamblesI’ve ever witnessed in a video game. It’s just a couple of pictures and a themetrack, with no text whatsoever; but these elements manage to create anatmosphere so encompassing that you just want to know more.   Once that splendid intro is over, you’re letloose in the game world. No briefing, no tutorials, no explanations whatsoever;you’re just left to your own devices, free to figure out the gameplay andprogress at you own pace. In-game menus and gameplay hints are kept to a bareminimum to enhance immersion; factor in the mesmerizing graphics and theriveting music, and you get an incredibly absorbing gameplay experience. When Ifinally emerged from my session, I had an Inception-like feeling ofcoming back to the surface — like I was returning fromsome deep, out-of-this-world place.   I could rave about the great physics, the inspired puzzle-litegameplay, the lush graphics and the haunting soundtrack; but for me, HLD’smost memorable aspect is first and foremost its immersive quality. It’s a gamethat pulls you in like few games I’ve encountered — not thanks to its gameplay,but thanks to its atmosphere. Gameplay in itself in remarkably simple —activate switches, kill foes, collect stuff — but the allure and mystery of HLD’suniverse lends even the most basic act some meaningful weight. You’re not justa player pushing buttons: you’re a lone soul — the titular ‘drifter’ — tryingto escape an unfriendly environment and to make sense of what happened to you.   The Verdict: Why, of course Hyper Light Drifter is a New Classic! It’sabsolutely splendid, and it totally deserves my love and my playtime — and a spot in The Collection. Maybe Heart Machine will see fit toport upcoming sequel Hyper Light Breaker to the Switch — fingerscrossed!"},

The Tales game I really,really wanted to play was Berseria;but as it’s not available on the Switch, I have to make do with Vesperia. The title is nearly the same,and it even has a pirate theme — the next best thing, indeed.   The Game: It’s a Tales game, soobviously things were not going to go smoothly. First thing first, I don’tfancy the MC, who unpleasantly reminds me of Luke Fon Fabre in Tales of the Abyss; and I fancy evenless his throwaway canine sidekick, which looks like a cheap version of RedXIII from FFVII. In fact, I have anissue with the game’s aesthetics as a whole. I don’t like the character models,which stand in a disturbing uncanny valley halfway between chibi and realistic;and the cell-shaded effect grates on my retinas.   Cutscenes are nicely skippable, and I like that;what I like less is the fact that these skippable cutscenes fill you in with somenecessary intel — like, where you have to go and what youhave to do. I vainly searched for a mission briefing in the menu, beforethrowing in the towel and resorting to running around aimlessly. Talking aboutthis: I absolutely hate when RPGsopen in a town hub and have you run errands for an uncanny amount of time.Look, Bandai Namco: if I wanna stroll through busy streets to perform a mundanetask, I’ll just go on with my daily life. Let me roam and fight, damnit!   The Verdict: That’s a great many things I don’t likeright of the bat, and it should surprise no one that I turned off my Switchbefore fighting a single battle. Now here’s my quandary: I have to decide if Iwant to sift through long cutscenes and potentially irritating character anticsto get — maybe — to some good gameplay. As plenty of games I loved right fromthe first second are sitting proudly in my collection already, I’m afraid Vesperia is doomed!"},

Why do I mention this, you may ask? Well, to highlight the fact that Ididn’t expect much from Sparklite,despite its honourable 75 score on Metacritic.   The Game: From gazing at gameplay screenshots, I knew about the vibrantcolours and the gorgeous environments already; what I didn’t, and couldn’t knowabout, were the tight controls and stellar physics. This is 2D Zelda on steroids: the MC slashes stuffwith that abandon I’ve always wanted, yet never quite got, fromprime-and-proper Link. There is some great dynamism at work there, so much sothat you get the impression the MC is flying rather than running — and yet you’re in full control, with none of the floatiness thatcan pop up when handling a speedy sprite. And mind you, you’ll need all thespeed and the full control you can muster, because some foes out there are realb*tches with tricky patterns.  While Sparklite looks andfeels like a crossover between 2D Zeldaand 16-bit Seiken Densetsu, itactually plays like a Rogue-lite.Here’s the gameplay loop in one sentence: you explore procedurally generatedzones to collect the titular sparklite, a type of gem that allows you topurchase all sorts of upgrades, in order to get stronger, go further and gathermore sparklite. That’s a very self-contained loop, quite phone-gamey in itssimplicity; but such loops usually go straight to my gamer’s heart, and thisone was no exception.   The Verdict: I played for roughly 30 minutes: enough togain some nifty upgrades and realise that Sparkliteis probably a short and sweet game — and that I want much more of it!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #58: Trails of Cold Steel III", "date": "17/11/2022", "text": "The Backstory: The Cold Steel subseriesstarted on the Vita way back in 2013 and graced Sony’s legacy piece of kit withtwo entries, before moving on to the PS4 in 2017 and to the Switch in 2020 — fully showcasing NihonFalcom’s patience and dedication to their craft. I kept securing those Cold Steel entries all these years — without playing a single one of them, and thus without knowing ifI even loved the series at all. As the 4th game is supposed to bethe final one, the time is ripe to check if I have a glorious epic at myfingertips — or a quartet of pawn-shop-headed cartridges.   The Game: Most Switch RPGs I’ve played lately feature skippablecutscenes — and ColdSteel III is no exception, to my utter delight. Once the skipping was done, I was let loose in adungeon with a full crew of characters, free to roam and slaughter stuff. Youknow I really love my in medias resintroductions in RPGs, dear fellow gamers; and I like them even more when the in medias res factor spreads all theway to the gameplay.   Talking about the gameplay, it was mostly combat — which I obviouslylapped up. I was let free to tinker with the controls and explore the fightingsystem at will, and no nosy tutorial came to interrupt me. That’s how Idiscovered three types of offensive moves with different ranges and mechanics,party member combo dynamics and devastating uber-powerful attacks — all that ina mere three battles, thank you very much! ColdSteel III’s fighting system is nicely approachable yet quite deep, theperfect vehicle to fight it your way.Cherry on the cake, it offers plenty of eye-popping animations and the possibility to skip them on thefly.      The Verdict: I didn’t push very far, as: a) I didn’t want to spoil myself, and b)I had seen enough to know that I definitely wanted more of Cold Steel. It offers some polished and stylish fighting, which isalways a must in RPGs; and a saga that spans over four games has to be interesting,even to my jaded, ‘I-don’t-care-about-no-story-in-my-RPG’ eyes. Until now, Iwas afraid I might not enjoy modern Falcom games, which would have been a blowto my gaming morale; but my stint with ColdSteel III reassures me — now I can peacefully waitfor all these Legend of Heroes Switchremakes!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #57: Poison Control", "date": "16/11/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Do I actually like Nippon Ichi Software as a developer? I’m notsure. Half of their titles were a miss with me (Cladun,Cladun Returns, Criminal Girls 2), a quarter were a hit (Criminal Girls, Labyrinth of Refrain, The Princess Guide), andthe last quarter I have yet to play (Disgaea,Labyrinth of Galleria, The Longest Five Minutes). Let’s findout where Poison Control stands inthis mess!  The Game: PC is bound to be deeplypolarizing, simply by virtue of its aesthetic choices. Love it or hate it, theviolent, eye-piercing pink colour palette is a bold choice, and one that makesthe game instantly memorable. Another memorable choice is the trippysoundtrack, which is the most atmospheric and un-gaming thing this side of Sonic R. Needless to say, I lap up these bold choices — the more stylised a game, the better.    Other things I’m less enthusiastic about are the controls andphysics, which could definitely use some tightening up. The former areconfusing, with similar button combinations that you’re bound to mix up sooneror later; as for the latter, they can be a bit unprecise — aiming doesn’talways work, to quote only a point of contention.  Talking about aiming, the gameplay mixes third-person shooter andpuzzle elements, to create a surprising yet enticing mix that gels right away. Longstory short: you have to shoot at roaming foes, while purifying corrupted areasby running over them — all this to unlock stories of personal woes andstruggles à la Persona. It can take abit of time to find your groove: while I love both halves of that gameplayloop, I didn’t manage to combine them gracefully during my playtime. Thenagain, said playtime was under the 15-minutes-mark — no doubt I will find mygroove if I play longer.  The Verdict: you know where this is headed, dear fellow gamers: me cutting downthe New Classic allotted time means that we dohave a New Classic at our fingertips. I’ll gladly welcome Poison Control and its pink decadence into The Collection!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #56: Ni no Kuni 2", "date": "15/11/2022", "text": "The Backstory: I’ll admit it: I am kinda wary of Level-5. Although they shouldforever be praised for developing my beloved Dragon Quest IX, they arealso responsible for personal un-favourites of mine such as Yo-kai Watch and Fantasy Life. My suspicion only grew when Ni no Kuni 2 presented me with a licensing agreement rightof the bat. That screamed corporate;and unfortunately, it was a harbinger of things to come.  The Game: Look, I’ve seldom encountered a game as trite, flat and soulless as Ni no Kuni 2. It looks and feels like abad Disney movie — down to the nondescript cartoonish aesthetics,the utterly transparent characters and the plodding, uninspired soundtrack. Youeven have a bunch of anthropomorphised foes, just because — and even though it makes no sense at all and clashes withthe presence of human characters. To add insult to injury, these foes are notlions or eagles; they are rats. Canyou make it any more cliché, Level-5?   Worse, NNK2 feels childish — and not in a charming,heart-warming way. Not only is the story perilously simplistic, but gameplay objectivesare also chopped up and simplified to an absurd point. The game can — and will— literally ask you to run to the next door, before interrupting you with acouple of cutscenes — rinse and repeat. Maybe the gameplay changes later, forall I know; but I just cannot play until it does. A game that doesn’t manage tohook me right away has no business in my collection — or in my Switch’s slot.   The Verdict: This is not just baby’s first RPG; it’s literally an RPG forfive-years-olds. Such RPGs can perfectly exist — buthey, not in my collection!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #55: Dusk Diver", "date": "13/11/2022", "text": "The Backstory: You’d be forgiven for not having heard about Dusk Diver until now. It’s a Chinese Hack’n’slash with a 54 scoreon Metacritic, who sailed to our shores courtesy of PQube — I adore Pqube, but noresounding success has ever come from their overflowing drawers of niche games.They did a lovely job with the DayOne edition, granted; nonetheless, I fully expected not to be blown away by Dusk Diver.   The Game: Maybe these low expectations were precisely the reason DD actually blew me away — but honestly, I don’t think so. I think it has more to do with thesupremely clever in medias resintroduction, which allows you to get a feel of combat for as long as you fancy— before rewinding and launching the story from thestart. It also has a lot to do with the charming cast of characters, the trippymusic and the gorgeous aesthetics — all flashy neon colours and sharp lines.   Last but not least, my being blown away has everything to do withthe fighting system and the physics. The latter are top-notch, with just theright density and bouncy resistancefrom foes; as for the former, it offers the whole real-time shebang— aiming,weak & strong attacks, dash, jump, special attacks, you name it. Theredoesn’t seem to be much gameplay apart from, well, fighting; but who cares when fighting feels so good?   The Verdict: There’s nothing I love more than to have a huge crush on a game,especially when I expect the exact opposite — and well,Dusk Diver humoured me. I luv it, and it’s definitely joiningThe Collection!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #54: Mary Skelter Finale", "date": "11/11/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Despite not liking the series’ second instalment, I never questionedthe logic of buying that (supposedly) final one. For one, it’s much moreaffordable than its predecessor; for another, it’s a first-person dungeoncrawler, and I’ll be damned if I don’t give every single game belonging to thegenre its fair chance to shine.   The Game: I knew right away that my tolerance and perseverance would berewarded big time. Not only are cutscenes nicely skippable, but the yuckinessthat bothered me in the second entry is entirely absent. No more decaying andsickly hues, no more repulsive body horror displays: in lieu of all thatgrossness come dungeons choke-full of light and bright colours and a cute castfrom the whole series.  Even better is a feature that I cannot rememberencountering in any FPDC: namely, the possibility to switch between teams ofcharacters — and get some crawling and story progression under your belt as youdo so. MSF is obviously meant to be achoral game, in which every character gets to be handled and to shine; andwhile the switching feels a bit jerky and not entirely natural, it works greatnonetheless, and really brings something new and fresh to the FPDC formula.  Last but not least is the fighting system. Ididn’t fight enough to witness the game’s specific features in that department— blood splatter,Licking, Massacre and Blood Skelter states — but I sure fought enough to notice that combatis impossibly fast-paced and enthralling, and that I very much wanna get more of it. Mary Skelter being MarySkelter, I had to encounter a Nightmare — i.e. thelocal version of F.O.E.S. from EtrianOdyssey — in the first fifteen minutes of play; but I managed to escape thething without breaking a sweat. Either I grew desensitized to suchmonstrosities in FPDCs, or Compile Heart toned down the stress factor — eitherway, it only makes things better.  The Verdict: I very much wanna get more of MarySkelter Finale — New Classic, yes please! Cherry on the cake, I can also let go of thesecond entry without a second thought, and explore the first without worrying."},
{"title": "The New Classics #53: Shovel Knight – Treasure Trove", "date": "07/11/2022", "text": "The Backstory: No need to present ShovelKnight: that runaway success has been making Yacht Club Games’ fortunesince 2014, and keeps doing so as it’s ported to every platform under thegaming sun. I toyed with the idea of purchasing the physical 3DS edition someyears ago, but balked at the thing’s ludicrously high price. My hesitation ultimatelyproved fruitful: not only does the Switch edition kindly offer all three extracampaigns along with the original game, but it also comes with a much gentlerprice tag — and noregion lock hassle, b*tch. The Game: SK’s graphical influences areobvious: 8-bit home console Platformers, from Alex Kidd to Castlevania.Quite precise, I know — but the filiation is undeniable. That may have proved a little too retro for me, if not for twoimportant elements. For one: although I didn’t play the NES or the masterSystem, I’m familiar with overall 8-bit aesthetics thanks to my stints with theGame Boy and the Game Gear. For another: I don’t give a crap about graphics aslong as the gameplay is stellar.    And SK’sgameplay is stellar indeed! A lot has been said about the Ducktales inspiration, and most especially about the pogo jump; yetI quickly discovered that the titular Shovel Knight is not Scrooge McDuck when it comes to handling his stick. The crucialdifference is this: while the latter keeps pogo-jumping as long as you pressthe jump button, the former does so only if you land on something with a hitbox— namely, a foe. This makes things more complicated,but also more rewarding — I cannot describe how amazing it feels to chain jumps on a moving opponent. The Ducktales influence is much moreblatant, and untarnished, in the constant collecting of shiny gems — kindaregressive, but deeply enjoyable.  Contrary to its venerable model’s, SK’s physics are pixel-perfect — like, literally. You can flirtwith chasms and stand a mere pixel away from your death — all this while retaining total control. SK’s brand of Platforming is a perfectmix between the Super Mario and Sonic blueprints: deliberate and preciseas the former, easy-going and smooth as the latter. Handling the MC feelsdeeply fulfilling, no matter what you do; and since the game kindly gives youinfinite lives, you don’t ever have to worry about an untimely Game Over.  The Verdict: I stopped playing right the first level, because:a) I got a nice feeling of completion, and b) said first level’s awesome themetrack was looping in my head already, and I needed a break lest it stayed stuckin my head for the next seven days. Still, there is no doubt I wanted to keepplaying, which led to an bittersweet epiphany: back in the days, my dislike ofPlatformers had nothing to do with the genre as a whole, and everything to dowith the fact that my motor skills were — and still are — not good enough to master less-than-perfectcontrols. But hey, better late than never: I can now revel in 8-bit Platforming35 years after the facts, thanks to ShovelKnight — which is very much a New Classic of mine!"},

Sophieis the third one, after Iris on thePS2 and Ryza on the Switch. Why Sophie and not any other entry, I wonder;but as I enjoyed the original game, I’m certainly not gonna complain.  The Game: Giving Sophie 2 the NewClassic treatment was actually more a mere formality than a real test. As Isaid, I love the original game; and I don’t doubt for a second that I will loveSophie 2 just as much, if not more.Playing it was just a matter of testing the waters, and finding out if Ienjoyed the setting and introductory mechanics.  I couldn’t find much about the latter, because Sophie 2 features a lengthy,non-skippable intro. I could have been pissed off, if not for two importantdetails. For one, the story is actually quite promising, with mysteries by thetruckload right of the bat and a tried-and-tested isekai formula that piqued my curiosity. For another, that intro gave me a glorioussneak peek one of the most impossibly gorgeous game worlds I’ve ever had thejoy of gazing at.  I’ll say it: Erde Wiege (Earth Cradle, if GoogleTranslate is to be trusted) is totally one of the main reasons I’ll play Sophie 2. These impossibly bright andlush shades of green enraptured my retinas and pierced my gamer’s soul like noother videogame colour palette since the oceanic blues in Ecco the Dolphin. And mind you, it’s not only a matter of colours;I’ve seldom seen a game world as vibrant and alive as Erde Wiege. Yet at the same time, it has a dreamy,elusive, nearly unreal quality thatperfectly fits the game’s overall theme of dreams and parallel universes. Craftinga game world — or anywork of fiction, for that matter — that feelslike a dream is no easy feat; yet Gust pulled off that tour de force with gusto.   The Verdict: I adore Sophie 2’s settingindeed; and although I have yet to discover combat, foraging and alchemy, Ihave no doubt I’m going to enjoy them as well. New Classic, yet please!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #51: Sakuna – Of Rice and Ruin", "date": "03/11/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Here comes the second work of Edelweiss, a developer that isbasically a two-men team. Their first work, a Shoot’em up named Astebreed,reaped stellar reviews and enviable scores; and so did Sakuna. It’s hardto score a hit with your first game, let alone with two games in a row; thatobviously made me curious, and I purchased the pair. Astebreed willwait, as it is a digital-only game; but Sakuna can, and must, be put tothe New Classic test.   The Game: I honestly have trouble believing that such a solid, hearty game isthe work of two developers only. The goodness starts right away with thesplendid character art, the humorous dialogue and the zesty story, and keepsgoing with the tight physics and the slick gameplay. The tutorial alone is amasterpiece, as it tells the story while pulling you in and teaching you thecontrols. Talking about ‘em controls, they take a bit of getting used to,especially when it comes to climbing walls — but maybethat’s just me, as I’ve had issues with that particular move in various gamesalready.   I must mention something important: the game looks much, much betterin motion than in screenshots. I was honestly surprised at how ugly my screencaptures look, all the more so after enjoying the splendour of the real thing.Beyond that beauty in movement, Sakuna’s gameplay provides a unique feelthat can only be experienced when playing it yourself: it’s some kind of fluid,nearly liquid impression that I cannot remember encountering in anyother game.  Sakuna is also one of these (rare) gamesthat manage to tickle my gaming fernweh. I swear my breath caught in mythroat when I saw the vista below: I immediately wanted to dive into my Switchscreen, and explore that place myself. Not only that, but the feeling stayedwith me and kinda grew stronger with time; thinking back on it, my gamer’sheart is filled with a sweet, dreamy wanderlust, and I want nothing more thanto play again.   Talking about playing, I actually didn’t play long enough to reachthe farming simulator section; but I have no doubt it will be just as excellentand polished as the rest of the game. In fact, I stopped right after the firstlevel, for a simple reason: cutscenes are not skippable, and I didn’t want tospoil myself. Anyway, I had seen enough to determine Sakuna’s destiny.Namely…  The Verdict: For a great many reasons, Sakuna is indeed a New Classic ofmine! I can only hope that Astebreed will be just as enchanting, andthat Edelweiss will release more lovingly crafted games. As for me, I’m movingon to the next potential cult classic — a gamer’s work is never done!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #50: Nights of Azure 2 – Bride of the New Moon", "date": "01/11/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Another graceful and subtly fan-servicey offering from Gust, of Atelierand Blue Reflection fame. I was miffed that the first one remained a PS4exclusive on our shores, to the point where I actually imported the JapaneseVita version to get a taste of the series. I shouldn’t have bothered — or maybe it’s goodthat I did: because if that second entry is worth the New Classic title, thenI’ll definitely want to play the first.   The Game: I had virtually forgotten all the Yoru No Nai Kuni art I sawover the years; but I was quickly reminded of it upon diving into NoA2.Like, there was that special edition featuring the crew feeling each other up,and… But I digress: what I wanted to say is that the yuri is strong with thatseries. But while it’s blatant in the side art, the game itself handles theyuri-ness in a much more subtle, delicate, nearly romantic way. It’s all amatter of tell-tale looks, well-chosen dialogues and facial expressions, andgenerally instilling some potent erotism while not showing anything untoward. I swear I found myself nearly blushing at times; some otome outthere could definitely take a leaf from NoA2’s book.   As troubling as NoA2’s lingering erotism is, I didn’t let itdivert me from my main focus — the gameplay, baby! While thenon-skippable cutscenes bothered me a bit, I was more than convinced by thefighting. Granted, I’ve seen more stellar physics out there; but NoA2’scombat remains perfectly enjoyable, with a smooth yet dynamic quality and solidcontrols. The game features a sidekick system: a so-called ‘Lily’ lends you ahand and complements the MC in battle. This is more than mere fan-serviceycosmetics, as you can tweak the strategies involved and have your Lily performin various ways — and hey, they work.   The Verdict: I own some great Hack’nSlashes already; but given my appetite forthe genre, I can always make room for more of them in my collection. Plus, Ilove NoA2’s aesthetics and erotism, and the story has me intrigued. Moreplease!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #49: Dragon Star Varnir", "date": "31/10/2022", "text": "The Backstory: I secured the physical version of that title from Limited Run Games,based on the cover art and gameplay pitch alone. Then, I learnt that it was anoffering from my most beloved Compile Heart, and I knew I was in for someserious gaming goodness — I mean, have Compile Heartever disappointed me as a developer?   The Game: Although the battle system is its own thing (more on that verysoon), DSV is as close to an Hyperdimension Neptunia game as itgets without actually being an HNgame. It sports the same pint-sized dungeons, the same roaming foes and thesame possibility to attack them with a ‘Symbol Attack’ and gain the upper handin battle. Last but not least, it sports the same delightful and skimpy in-battletransformations and attacks, replete with gorgeous, eye-popping animations.  There are also some major differences that youcannot miss — starting with the atmosphere and artstyle. While HN is all flashiness and bright colours, DSV is onthe more sombre and subdued side. And yes, we have to address the elephant inthe room here: the graphics are horrendous. Not only are they dark tothe point of actually hindering navigation lest your Switch brightness becranked up to the max, but they’re also washed-out and fuzzy as all heck. Now,do I care? Nope, I don’t.  Last but not least is the fighting system. Longstory short: it’s awesome. I’m sure you want more details though — so here goes! It’syour classic yet efficient turn-based fare, made more strategic by an aerialelement that allows you to move vertically and choose the area you’ll target;while it’s not always relevant in random fights, you’ll definitely get to useit in boss fights. Then you have the jewel in the crown: the possibility to‘devour’ foes in order to assimilate their abilities and unlock new skills foryour crew. I find this a million times better than an actual recruiting system:it preserves the surprise effect and the thrill of getting flashy new skills,while dispensing with the hassle of training new additions. The best of twowords, yes indeed!  The Verdict: No suspense here, that little gem is here to stay! It was actuallydifficult to move on to the next game, as I wanted nothing than to keepplaying; but I’ll get back to Dragon Star Varnir soon enough. Untilthen, we keep hunting!"},

Had I known that the gameplaywas similar to Valkyria Chronicles, Imay have balked at the thought of playing it; however, I needn’t have worried,because I didn’t even reach my first battle!   The Game: So what happened? First, Re:Zerosuffers from a dire, atrocious case of badly handled exposition. Imagine an in medias res introduction, featuring acharacter who proceeds to hastily explain everything that happened during thelast weeks as well as the game’s base concepts, and you’ll have a good idea ofwhat RZ’ exposition feels like. Irealise that this introduction is probably meant as a quick recap for peoplewho know the novels, who may in turn be the game’s primary target; but theexperience feels deeply unpleasant for a player who’s new to the series.   Still, that poorly told introduction alonewouldn’t have been enough to deter me from playing. As it turned out, my mainproblem with RZ is this: I don’t careone bit about the characters, nor about whatever may happen to them. To makematters worse, the game keeps holding your hand way longer than necessary,telling you exactly what to do andhow to do it. I could have tolerated that hand-holding if I had fallen in lovewith the crew, or given said crew a chance to win my affections if I had beengiven more freedom to operate — but tolerating both is more than I can bear.  Indeed. The Verdict: Yes, Re:Zero reaped anenviable Metacritic score of 75; and yet, it left me completely cold. Thisproves once more that the gaming instinct rules supreme, and that I don’t needany other compass to guide me through these uncharted lands of still unplayedgames!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #47: Marchen Forest – Mylne and the Forest Gift", "date": "29/10/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Marchen Forest is a portof a phone game, and the last one of that batch of Asian games I snatched fromPlay-Asia. Internet wisdom describes it as an adventure game mixing alchemy androguelite-ish dungeon crawling, a mix that sounded pretty nifty to me. Surelynothing could go wrong with such a sound gameplay premise, right?   The Game: A lot of thing actually went wrong — and very quickly at that. First, MF is slow as all heck, and not just when it comes to loading times:everything drags on, from the transitions between scenes to the scenesthemselves — to the point where I thought the game hadglitched and frozen a couple of times.  As annoying as it is, that slowness pales in comparison with MF’s utter and unmissable weirdness. What exactly is weird in thatgame, you may ask? Well, everything.The camera angles are completely bonkers and switch constantly, going from sideviews to aerial ones with no rhyme or reason. The gameplay logic is outlandish: you’re sent on a mission to collectingredients in the great outdoors — only to be stoppedby an NPC blocking the way out of your garden, and forced to collect stuff insaid garden. Why not simply instruct me to, well, collect stuff in the garden, instead of using a random roadblock?Later, you have to get rid of that obstructing NPC by feeding it a donut youfind lying in that same garden: no challenge, no fun, just fake longevity atits best.    And since I’m mentioning NPCs, the whole crew ofcharacters looks and feels queer as well. Mylne herself could be cute if notfor her puke-green hair — yet she’s honestly the best-looking of the bunch. Everybody elselooks disturbing, from Mylne’s eyeless grandfather to that useless penguindelivering tutorials at random. Maybe it’s just a matter of taste, and maybethat posse feels like the pinnacle of character design to some eyes; but my ownretinas just cannot bear the sight of them any longer.   The Verdict: I very seldom dislike a game; but I genuinely dislike MarchenForest. It’s supposed to get better during late stages, as dungeon crawlingkicks in; however, I cannot wait, nor play, until it happen. I’d rather playsomething that lets me roam dungeons right away — andmakes me feel good while we’re at it."},
{"title": "The New Classics #46: Final Fantasy XII – The Zodiac Age", "date": "28/10/2022", "text": "The Backstory: The late-’90s entries of the series didn’t click with me at all; butI reasoned that maybe the Noughties entries would fare better — and that I may aswell give that remake a try since it was in my collection anyway. I know littleabout that game, except that the fighting system generated some controversyback in the days because of its ARPG influences. Now that sounded pretty good to me; and I was eager to reach my firstfight and see for myself how that infamous fighting system fared.     The Game: FFXII humoured me bykindly letting me skip every single cutscene, which is something I genuinelydidn’t expect from the series. However, any good impression I may have garneredfrom that player-friendliness started to evaporate as I discovered thetutorial. Not only does it bother explaining uber-basic actions such as ‘Movewith L’ and ‘Press A to talk to NPCs’, but it’s also delivered during gameplayby your captain (or whoever that guy is). Talk about clumsily breaking immersionand ruining your carefully crafted inmedias res introduction, game!    Lack of narrative flair aside, the existence ofsuch a hand-holdy tutorial really worried me. Was I actually dealing with a(shiver) casual RPG? That certainlydidn’t bode well for whatever was to come, oh noooo precious. I didn’t have towait long before my first battle, and… oh, lord.    FFXII’s fighting system is called ‘Active Dimension Battle’. I reckonthis refers to the fact that exploration and combat are no longer separate; butstill, the word ‘active’ is a hilariously poor choice to describe combat in FFXII. Here’s how it works: upon meetinga foe, you open a menu and input a command — let’s say, ‘attack’. You then haveto position your character so that said attacks can land — i.e. right next tothe foe. You can change the active command at any given moment, and retreat abit to heal. Now, can you actually slash at things by pressing buttons? Nope,you can’t. The only two things you can do are: a) input commands, and b) movearound so that the commands can execute.   I swear I was left literally speechless after that first battle —like, I couldn’t believe what I was playing. I fought a couple of extra battlesfor good measure, and realised that I simply couldn’t go on. Now, I could comment on the monochrome greyishaesthetics, or the unexpected European medieval atmosphere; but I feeleverything would be pointless after that fighting system debacle.   The Verdict: I’m very tolerant towards fighting systems in RPGs; but as I saidbefore, automated combat is where I draw the line. FFXII’s combat is not fully automated, as you still play animportant role; but I don’t fancy that role. It’s too passive, yet toodemanding: you’re denied the ARPG thrill of slashing around and the turn-based RPG joy of watchingyour commands unfold after input, and end up with the worst of both worldsinstead. Well, that’s a miss again for FinalFantasy — next please!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #45: The Princess Guide", "date": "27/10/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Here’s yet another title that made the move from the Vita to theSwitch — and to our shores as well. The premise soundsinteresting, the cover art looks good — heck, what are we waiting for? Let’sride, baby!   The Game: The Princess Guide opens with a tutorial, and let me tellyou: you better take screenshots of that darn tutorial, because the buttoncombinations are so outlandish that they’re nearly impossible to remember. DidI take screenshots? You bet I did!   Actually, the whole game has an outlandish feel.Take the animated story sequences, for instance: why do the characters jiggleso darn much? You have to see it to believe it, I swear. The dispatch mechanicsare also counter-intuitive as all heck — the worst partbeing that I cannot even explain why they are. They just don’t feelright; play the thing, and you’ll see immediately what I mean. Also, thegame doesn’t let you save at all times; yet I didn’t manage to figure out thelogic behind the timing for saving. I could go on and on, but the bottom lineis this: the whole gameplay is kinda offbeat, and feels like it’s been designedby something out of this world.     The titular princess training part is muchlighter than I expected, consisting only of optional prompts in battle and atraining/upgrading option between missions. It suits me perfectly as I’m nosimulation game expert; however, I can imagine a veteran of the genre beingthoroughly disappointed. As a matter of fact, TPG is surprisingly hollow;at its core, it’s really just a string of linear real-time battles loosely tiedup through the training theme. Even that bunch of soldiers cruising with youseems to be a mere cosmetic choice: so far, I have yet to them do somethinguseful in battle — or do anything at all, for that matter.   The Verdict: Although The Princess Guide is a flawed game that lacksdepth, I really like it. Combat is entertaining, and the aesthetics aregorgeous and memorable — and well, that’s enough for meas far as that game is concerned!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #44: G-Darius HD", "date": "26/10/2022", "text": "The Backstory: One of the (many) reasons I love the Switch is the abundance ofShoot’em ups in its library — at least compared to otherportable consoles. An interesting pattern is emerging when it comes to thegenre: a developer releases a remake of a beloved game in their flagship series,along with a new and exclusive entry. Success did it with Cotton, and sodid Taito with Darius; we’re now dealing with G-Darius HD, theSwitch remake of a 1997 arcade release.   The Game: I’ll admit it: something felt weird during my first secondswith G-Darius HD. It was a feeling of foreignness of the controls, anuncanny valley of sorts in the graphics — at any rate, it nearly made me turn off my Switch on thespot. But I forged ahead, and the weirdness quickly dissipated.    In its place came one of the most inventive andsatisfying shoot’em ups I’ve played so far. First, I must rave about thescrolling, which is just my wildest dreams come true. To put it simply, thescreen carries you around, at a speed that is just pitch-perfect — enough to be thrilling, yet not too challenging. With yourmovement taken care of, you’re free to shoot at stuff and gaze at the gorgeousvistas. The concept is brilliantly exploited in boss battles: bosses kindlypresent their vulnerable parts to your line of fire, in what can only bedescribed as some splendid battle choreography.    Talking about splendid, I must also rave about the game’saesthetics. The marine theme comes completely out of left field in an aerialshoot’em up; and yet, it works beautifully. These mechanical fishes are adelight to look at — and just as much of a delight to shoot at. Thepointy polygonal graphics immediately reminded me of the 3D phases in SonicRush — needless to say, that association put me in a very good mood andmade me very partial towards G-Darius HD.  Then I discovered the game’s unique gameplay mechanics, and therewas no turning back. Being able to capture enemy ships and use their firingabilities is just brilliant, and so is the game’s trademark laser. Then youhave the branching paths, which add plenty of replay value, and the automaticsaving at the beginning of each stage. And do you know what is even better,dear fellow gamers? Complimentary infinite lives. Yes, that’sright: should you want to, you can keep your life count filled up at all times— or not.   The Verdict: There’s no suspense left here, I guess: I love thatgame, I wanna keep it, and I’m very much planning to purchase the newestexclusive Switch entry!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #43: Undernauts – Labyrinth of Yomi", "date": "20/10/2022", "text": "The Backstory: At thatpoint, I was seriously afraid I would never live to see another originalfirst-person dungeon crawler from Experience Inc. Their last such release was2017’s Students of Round 2, an Xbox One title released only in Japan;since then, they’ve focused mostly on the Spirit Hunter trilogy. But loand behold, Undernauts is here to prove that Experience Inc. didn’tforget their strongest suit indeed. Well, colour me relieved!   The Game: Aridity is thyname, game. Forget about lush environments and anime aesthetics à la DemonGaze; Undernauts is all about Wizardry-like dryness, fromits realistic character art to its no-frill dungeons. It’s very much a designchoice, and it’s a highly cohesive proposition. It starts from the dry yetcomplex MC creation interface, keeps going in the story told through fixedscreens, gets stronger in the arid dungeons that don’t even bother trying tolook good, and culminates in the non-animated battles.   Obviously, all that dryness doesn’t bother me in the slightest: I’mhere to explore every nook and cranny of every single dungeon and kill stuff,and Undernauts provides ample amounts of both. Exploration is madesmooth and nice by items that allow you to create shortcuts, as well as anauto-move option that is just perfect when you wanna go back to base. Asfor combat, it’s definitely on the smooth side as well: random encounters arefew and far between, and foes are visible in the field and can be engaged atwill — or not.   Anotherthing that screams old-fashioned FPDC is the absence of handholding in allthings fighting and character creation. You soon get to create a bunch of crewmembers to accompany you; and there are just so many awesome character models,both exclusive and hailing from former Experience Inc. games, that you mayeasily forget to balance your team. Then you may end up in battle with a bunchof characters that just cannot act, because they have melee abilitiesand you put them in the rear line. Too bad, so sad — your mistake, b*tch!Another modern game would have informed you of your poor choice, but not Undernauts:that game lets you figure things out on your own. And guess what? I luv it.   The Verdict: First-persondungeon crawler, Experience Inc. and a retro approach to game design: really, Idon’t need anything more to be on board. Welcome to the collection, buddy!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #42: Hades", "date": "19/10/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Ihonestly didn’t think I’d live to see a rogue-lite get rave reviews, universalacclaim and an unexpected-yet-prompted-by-success physical release — but I sure as heck won’t complain about it. Everything has beensaid about Hades, and the only thing left to do is add my two cents —let’s roll, baby!  The Game: I won’t waste toomuch time raving about the lush graphics, the gorgeous colours and thesumptuous character art; instead, I’ll jump straight to the gameplay — and to the point for a change. Look, the physics are stellar, thecontrols tight as a drum, and handling little Hades is pure delight right fromthe first second. Then you have the progression loop, which is typical of arogue-lite: you can feel yourself get stronger and better every loop,and you can go a bit further as a result, without the punishment and the ‘eventhe tiniest mistake could be your deadfall’ factor of hardcore roguelikessuch as Shiren. I tackled a couple of gameplay loops, and I reapedsomething every single time: currency to purchase upgrades, knowledge of enemypatterns, better weapons and abilities — you name it.  Havingsaid that, I’ll admit something: I expected Hades to be a bit moreaddictive, and maybe even… better, in a way. I mean, it’s a reallysplendid rogue-lite, but… I’ve played other rogue-lites that felt just as goodand addictive, such as Sorcery Saga, RemiLore or Touhou Genso Wanderer. I realise that Hades is the first ever rogue-lite to reachsuch a wide audience, and that most of the hype is due precisely to that— the gaming community discovering the appeal of rogue-liting. But I knew thatappeal inside out already, and thus the infatuation is kinda lost on me.      The Verdict: AlthoughI’m not as delirious about Hades as reviewers and newcomers to thegenre, I won’t deny that it’s a great rogue-lite with fantastic potential. NewClassic, yes please!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #41: Monark", "date": "18/10/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Thelatest offering from Lancarse, who also developed Lost Dimension and ZankiZero. Those guys sure seem to excel at crafting original gameplaysdelivering a lot of replay value; and well, Monark is no exception. Itmixes position-based combat à la Hyperdimension Neptunia, an explorationof the crew’s woes à la Persona, a really thicc atmosphere and anintriguing stat system involving an introductory quiz —and the seven deadly sins. Well, colouredme interested!  The Game: The MonarkWikipedia page, as well as some reviews, describes the game’s fighting systemas ‘tactical’. I’m not sure I would have used that term; for me, ‘tactical’automatically means ‘grid-based SRPG’ — but maybe I’mwrong, as gameplay styles constantly evolve and terms are being redefined on a regular basis. One thing I amsure about, on the other hand, is that I love that fighting system. It’sno new proposition, neither for the genre nor for Lancarse themselves; but itworks great all the same. My only pet peeve is that you have to keep pressingthe ZR button to speed up combat; I would really have preferred a Toggle on /Toggle off option. Actually, that ZR issue is a bit of a thorn in my side. It’s a motifthroughout the gameplay, with dialogue sections using the same trick — no skipping allowed, except for the cinematic cutscenes. I don’tlike that; but as I’m planning to read dialogues if I replay the game, it mightnot be a big issue after all. What might be a big issue is the fighting /narrative ratio — that is, if it remains the same as in the early stages. Look,there is not nearly enough combat so far for greedy little me; and the storyhas better be fascinating if it keeps being that overbearing until thecredits.   Actually,and although I’m complaining, I’m really hooked on Monark’s atmosphere.As usual in such cases, I cannot tell exactly why I like it — but I suredo. And heck, the MC’s fighting outfit is properly awesome, and I’mreally a sucker for such details. Actually, even the cutscene that introducessaid outfit to our starry eyes is awesome — see for yourselves by checkingthese gorgeous screen captures below.  Last butnot least, you have the Ego system, which paves the way for a lot ofreplay value. To sum it up, an introductory quiz allows the game to determineyour main deadly sin, which in turn determines other stuff I couldn’t reachduring my limited play time. Values for other sins can be raised as wellthroughout the game, no doubt for increased benefits of all sorts. I earnestlyanswered the quiz, and let me tell you: that thing is absolutely spot-on.See for yourselves the description below: doesn’t that fit little me to a T?The +500 games in my collection are collectively screaming “yes it does,b*tch”.   The Verdict: Well,that’s a hit! I actually played the demo, but I ordered the real thing before Ieven started writing that post. Welcome to the collection, buddy; and now, backto the hunt we go!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #40: WitchSpring3 Re:Fine", "date": "15/10/2022", "text": "The Backstory: I hadnever heard of the WitchSpring series before purchasing that Switchremake of a 2017 iOS game; but from what I understood, said series sports some Atelier-litegameplay with heavier emphasis on combat. I was mighty fine with that, andeager to see if the dreamy, ethereal atmosphere conveyed by the cover art was athing in the game.   The Game: That dreamy,ethereal atmosphere is a thing indeed in the game. It’s made of gorgeous fadedcolours, subtly blurred graphics, delicate character art, minimalistic soundtrackand SFX and the titular witch’s wistful, melancholic voice; and whether you likeit or not, it’s striking and bound to leave an imprint on a gamer’s soul.   As much as I love atmosphere in RPGs, I never forget the gameplay. Andwell, I’ll say this: I find WS3RF pretty deep for a mobile game. MaybeI’m just being too indulgent, or maybe I’m out of touch with mobile gaming; butthere is more than enough in that game to keep me busy and involved. Grinding,roaming, harvesting, forging, synthesizing, training, and a bit of story on top— what more can you ask for?   I am especially fond of the fighting system, which is lifted straight from SeikenDensetsu 2&3. You engage enemies directly on the field, and you chooseactions from a wheel popping up on the screen while movement is suspended; thewhole affair is quite snappy, yet kinda smooth as well. I am equally fond ofall the gorgeous little animations: some are graceful, some are funny, butthey’re all eye-candy. Last but not least, the instant teleportation to basereally made my day — thanks a million, G Choice!   The Verdict: Welcometo the collection, buddy! You ooze charm, and your gameplay is simple yet quiteengaging as far as I’m concerned. I’ll play more of you with great delight!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #39: Abyss of the Sacrifice", "date": "13/10/2022", "text": "The Backstory: A Switchremake of a 12-years-old PSP game, and yet another one of these weirdEnglish-supporting Asian games I snatched from Play-Asia. I’ve tested three ofthem so far, and two proved disappointing; will AotS even up the ratio?On paper, it sure could: it’s a Point&Click with puzzles, adventure and VNelements, and I usually love such cocktails.  The Game: Graphics are asbarebones as they come, with no charm or style whatsoever — I felt like I was staring at one of these ‘Draw your own manga’tutorial books. It’s a bit of a pity, but it’s something I can live with.Likewise, the music is insanely irritating, and I wanted to claw my ears offafter a few loops; but again, this can easily be taken care of by shutting thesound down.   One thing that cannot be alleviated, on the other hand, is thegameplay. There seems to be a thrilling story at work there, and the promise ofmany a tricky puzzle; however, I couldn’t see any of it, because I didn’tmanage to get out of the first room. Let that sink in: I cleared MystIII without a walkthrough back in the days, yet I couldn’t solve AotS’very first puzzle. I don’t know if this was a glitch or if I was just not doingthe right thing, but I didn’t manage to use the items at my disposal; yetbeyond that, I couldn’t even figure out where to use them. Mycharacter’s leg was stuck under a pipe, and I had to get out by using a needle,a screwdriver and some hose hanging from the ceiling —not exactly intuitive, methinks.  I finallyresorted to running to a walkthrough, betting on the fact that it would help meunderstand the game’s logic and/or that subsequent puzzles would be moreobvious; that’s when I discovered, to my utter dismay, that no English walkthroughcurrently exists. That pretty much sealed AotS’ fate; as much as I lovePoint&Clicks, mystery and huis clos, I just won’t play a game whose innerlogic I cannot fathom.  The Verdict: Abyssof the Sacrifice won’t even out the aforementioned ratio — nor will it be granted a spot in the collection. I lovePoint&Clicks, but I won’t allow them to waste my precious time — or worse,make me feel like I’m dumb as a brick."},
{"title": "The New Classics #38: Wing of Darkness ", "date": "09/10/2022", "text": "The Backstory: That oneis a weird beast indeed. It’s the work of Production Exabilities, a developerthat’s so utterly unknown that you cannot find a single piece of data about iton the internet. And when I say “the work”, I mean ‘THE work’, as WoD isthe only game ever developed by (whatever is) Production Exabilities. Wing of Darkness totally flew under theradar (no pun intended), with only a handful of reviews on the internet and noWikipedia page whatsoever. Now, is this the result of poor advertising anddistribution, or is there a more sinister reason at work?   The Game: We were off to areally good start when WoD offered me an uber-easy difficulty settingcalled “smooth sailing”, before ushering me in a gorgeous mountainous fightingarena after a beautiful skippable cutscene. This was actually the tutorial; andafter a bit of fumbling with the controls, I cleared the whole thing withoutbreaking a sweat. And then… a glitch occurred, and the screen went totallyblack while dialogue went on. (Wing of Darkness indeed, hahaha!) I waited abit to see if it would get back to normal, but no luck —that’s a soft reset for ya, mate!   Fortunately,the game had saved my progress, and I could proceed from the beginning of thefirst real mission. Gorgeous landscape again, but a hefty 50 targets to takedown. I got rid of 49 of them… and then, the lock-on aiming suddenly stoppedworking. I don’t know if this was another glitch or just the way thegame operates; one thing I know, though, is that I was royally pissed off.  A title with a stellar gameplay could have gotten away with this; but WoD’sgameplay is barely palatable. It’s a slower, clunkier version of Azur Lane’sgameplay, with more confusion added and all the fun sucked dry. The controlsare unintuitive and unprecise, the physics are wobbly and unreliable; and360-degree movement, which would be awesome with great controls and physics,only makes things more tedious and complicated.    The Verdict: That wasa very honest try, from a developer that obviously used all its resources doingso; but not matter how you slice it, Wing of Darkness is a broken,imperfect mess of a game with few redeeming qualities. I usually have someunhealthy fondness for such games; but being able to play is where Idraw the line, and WoD crossed it with its weird glitches."},
{"title": "The New Classics #37: Monster Hunter Stories 2 – Wings of Ruin", "date": "08/10/2022", "text": "The Backstory: althoughthe canon series never clicked with me, I had good hopes I could enjoy thatspinoff. We’re talking quests and classic turn-based combat; surely thingscannot go wrong with such sound basics, right?   The Game: One thing thatalways bothered me with the Monster Hunter series is its stiff, oh-we’re-so-seriouspresentation. Over the course of my gaming career, I’ve only encountered asingle other series that takes itself so seriously; that series was FinalFantasy, and that encounter didn’t go too well. I expected morelight-heartedness from WoR — to no avail, alas. It’s not as stiff as thecanon MH games, but it’s still way stiffer than I’d like.  The environments are drop-dead gorgeous, that cannot be denied. Still,another thing that cannot be denied is that they feet just a tad too bigfor my taste. That is the Monster Hunter style all through andthrough, and I cannot blame WoR for emulating it; but I cannot forcemyself to stomach it either.  Not that I will ever have to, actually. Things unravelled completelyright from the first battle, when I discovered the fighting system. It’sturn-based allright; but it’s also based on some rock-paper-scissors mechanicsthat feel more tedious than thrilling. There is no real strategy involved, as youjust have to pick up the type of attack that will deal damage against youropponent; once you make your way through trial and error and nail that damagingattack, it’s just a matter of spamming it until the end. Why not allow me tospam attacks right of the bat, Capcom? The way I see it, this is just a failedattempt at jazzing up what is ultimately some very basic turn-based fightingsystem.  The Verdict: Alas, woeand misery, Monster Hunter spinoffs fare no better than canongames as far as I’m concerned. It’s time to stop torturing myself, and to ditchthe series entirely — hunting for prehistoric monstersis definitely not my cup of tea."},

Since I know little to nothing about these games’ gameplay, eachone is a complete surprise. Forward to the Sky, which was also part ofthe bunch, was a really bad surprise; will Aria Chronicle be a betterone?     The Game: Although I nevertouched a browser game in my life, I’ve always be drawn to their battledisplays for some unfathomable reason. Wonder why I’m suddenly mentioning this?Well, it’s because AC’s battle display screams ‘browser game’. Ididn’t expect this at all, and I nearly squealed with delight upon fighting myfirst battle. See for yourself below:  I also beamed with sweet nostalgia upon discovering the Riviera-infuseddungeon navigation, all fixed screens and arrow pointers. I can’t remember if Rivierahad a stamina system during navigation, but AC sure does: each move toan adjacent screen consumes 1 point of a gauge containing 70 — get too low, andyour crew start acting out. Fortunately, stamina management is not toostringent — just like inventory management, whichallows you to accumulate some serious loot before your pockets burst. I canvery well envision these two elements becoming trickier as dungeons get bigger,though — but we’re not there yet, and I’ll run to maps on the internet if thecrawling gets rough.  These two features alone had me sold, honestly; yet that kind gamecouldn’t help but throw more goodness at me — splendidsoundtrack, gorgeous sprites, lovingly detailed dungeons, interesting sidefeatures such as forging and recruiting mercenaries, and an overall lovely andmellow atmosphere I couldn’t get enough of.   The Verdict: Well, AriaChronicle sure was a pleasant surprise through and through. It’s quitederivative, but it manages to combine borrowed elements quite gracefully — and anyway, I luv it, and I don’t care one bit aboutderivative as long as me gaming instinct is thrilled. You’re allowed in thecollection, mate!"},

Utter lack of objectivity aside, the cover art alone gave me goodvibes, as well as the evocative title. I knew little about that game beforeplaying it, apart from the fact that it’s a console port of an Android game andthat the featured girls are moe interpretations of WW II ships. But who needsto know more when the gaming instinct claims a game? Let’s ride, baby!  The Game: Okay now, colourme in love. ALC swept me off my feet right away with its lushsoundtrack, splendid character art, zesty dialogues and bright colours. Thencame the gameplay, and there was no turning back: by the end of the firstbattle, I was definitely the game’s b*tch.   After a bunch of skippable cutscenes and a smoothest and most pleasantbit of navigation on the world map, I was thrown into my first battle — which was over in aminute, as I cruised in easy mode. But that minute was enough to get a massivecrush on the fighting system, which is unlike anything I’ve played before. Apicture being worth a thousand words, you can see above what the whole affair lookslike. Man, I just love that horizon view! Gimme more! I got morealright, in the form of a boss battle that was over in two minutes. Easy modereally is easy in ALC; maybe I’ll roll in normal mode when Ireplay the game. Ooops, did I spoil you already? Not quite, I guess; I spilledthe beans right from that section’s first sentence.  The Verdict: When Ihave such an instant crush on a game, I tweak the New Classic policy and don’tplay the allotted two hours. I don’t think anything that happens later canovercome that massively positive first impression — and hey, it frees up some precious time for othercontenders!"},

Here’s the story: I played thedigital Vita version some years ago, got bored in a flash and ditched the wholething. Fast-forward to 2022; I bought the second entry, read Kina’s postabout Overdose, got itchy and put CE2 to the test, and ended uploving it. There I was, happy and sated, browsing one of my Switch Unikeepbinders to select my next game — when I suddenlyspotted Overdose. How? When on earth did I buy that game? I sureas heck don’t remember doing so — which is not surprising at all, given theridiculous number of games I purchase. Anyway, I reasoned that since I ownedthe thing, I might as well put it to the New Classic test and see how it fared.  The Game: Well, colour meshocked: Overdose is much uglier than its sequel. I don’t think I’veever seen graphics that fuzzy and washed-out; needless to say, the vividcolours and overall stylishness of number 2 are nowhere to be found here.Although the difference is shocking, it’s by no means a deal-breaker; all thatfuzziness and these pastel hues combine to create some unique and recognizablegraphical style — that, or I’m suffering from a seriouscase of gaming Stockholm syndrome. Anyway, I wasn’t there for the graphics; Iwas there to see if the simulation phase was unskippable in that first entry.  I uttereda giant sigh of relief upon discovering that simulation can be skipped indeed — and should totally be skipped if you play ineasy mode, because it’s basically useless. Once I verified that most importantpoint, I was let free to roam a giant dungeon with many nooks and crannies anda crap ton of foes. I obviously had to slaughter every living being in sight;and it wasn’t long before I was seriously over-levelled, engaging lv.30 foeswith my lv.10 team of three — and winning without breaking a sweat.   I didn’tpolish off the first dungeon this time around, because I basically didn’t needto; however, I like the fact that dungeon roaming and socialization seem to becombined in Overdose. That school dungeon was teeming with fellow highschoolers I could talk to; that alone was enough to give them relief, and noneof them had the impudence to send me running errands like in their CE2fellows.   The Verdict: AlthoughI nearly had a fit upon seeing Overdose in my Switch binder, thingsfinally turned out pretty well. I like that game, and I’m very much gonna keepit in my precious collection. It offers the same Caligula Effectgoodness as its sequel, only with a very different atmosphere. That’s the DeathEnd Re;quest story all over again, and some series could well followthat trend — I’m looking at ya, HyperdimensionNeptunia canon line!"},

HMDA is a console remake, which appeared first on the Vita in 2016before making the move to the PS4 and the Switch in 2020. All I can say is thatI’m glad I didn’t get my paws on the Japanese Vita version on a whim back inthe days — and let’s face it, we all know I could totally have done so.    The Game: As you start arun and get acquainted with the unfamiliar gameplay, you’re bound to let alifetime of RPG experience and reflexes run the show — which will invariably lead to a resounding fail.Crafty little me didn’t spend a dime during my first run, and spent the wholetime fighting, chatting with NPCs and exploring the world map. Needless to say,I didn’t get anything done; still, I wasn’t miffed, because I saw this as oneof the game’s greatest strengths. You’re free to spend your time the way yousee fit, and I always love freedom in a game — as wellas a healthy and fulfilling die-and-retry loop, which is totally what HMDAoffers.   I couldn’t help but see the game as a metaphor of life itself — you will end up waning and passing away, so you’d better make themost of your precious time before it happens. Masuda got the gameplay loop’sconcept from watching his father slowly deteriorate from cirrhosis; but unlikemany indie developers that shove their message down your throat, he managed tokeep it subtle — yet moving and thought-provoking. It’s not long before youditch your RPG automatisms and zero in on your main goal at the start of a run— get your former teammates back, fight the big baddie, solve local issues, you name it.   My onlyreal issues with the game are the lacklustre dungeon roaming — although it’smade easier by the presence of a map, it’s still tepid — and the lack oftime-skipping and dialogue-skipping options. I read something about the gamebeing designed to emulate commute play, meaning that you play a single loop ata time; still, I really think the console remake should have sported skippingoptions. Well, guess I have to play it the intended way then!    The Verdict: I’m gladto say that the importing hassle was worth it this time: HMDA is verymuch here to stay! I can envision smooth and satisfying runs once I master thegame’s inner workings; and anyway, sweet and short games are always welcome inmy precious collection."},

Then came the VN segments, all cracking dialogues and sharpdevelopments; add a bit of point-and-clicky action, and you get a multi-layeredgameplay that can totally claim complete originality.   The story promises a lot of mystery, as well as potential plot twistsand mindfucks; but the jewel in Yurukill’s crown is most definitely thecast of characters. Their stylish introduction sequence alone is enough to makeyou wanna discover them more; and if they are all as twisted and zany as MCSengoku, then I’m sure gonna have a blast cruising with them.   With all that goodness, it kinda doesn’t matter that the graphics arebarebones, and that the purple ornamentations around the dialogue boxes clashvigorously with the overall aesthetics and feel completely out of place.

What better opportunity, then, to get a taste of both?Let’s ride, baby!  The Game: I actually playedthe demo, but with a New Classic perspective in mind. I thus don’t know if theuber-fast introduction I witnessed is also a thing in the main game — but I sure dug it!I was let loose on the battlefield after a mere two minutes, free to slaughtermilling masses of foes to my murdering instinct’s heart’s content.  The combo system is awesome, and controls are as tight as they come.Graphics are a bit on the fuggly, no-personality-whatsoever side; but I canlive with that. I didn’t play enough to comment on the story or characterdevelopment, but what I’ve witnessed so far is promising. Really, my only pet peeveis the physics, which are not completely to my liking. I know I’mseriously nit-picking here; but I’ve been spoilt lately by awesome real-timegames with heavenly physics such as Deedlit in WL and Neptunia vs. Senran Kagura, and anything that doesn’t feel as tailor-made for selfishlittle me is bound to disappoint me a bit.   As to what bothers me exactly in FEW3H’s physics, I’d say it’sthe lack of density. Seeing waves of foes being knocked back is deeplysatisfying; however, it would be even more satisfying if said waves of foesdidn’t feel so light. Slashing at nearly weightless opponents kindabreaks the immersion, and reminds you that you’re dealing with a mere coderather than with flesh and blood foes. However, I’m fully aware that suchphysics are typical of the musou genre, and that I’ll certainly end uplapping them up before the credits roll.   The Verdict: Despitemy reservations about the floaty physics, FEW3H is very much here tostay. Not only is it fun and exhilarating to play, but it may also be my savinggrace, the only way I may manage to discover and enjoy the Three Hopesuniverse.

Cherry on the cake, the Frenchdialogue is especially well-crafted and seriously hysterical; so much so, infact, that I’ll most definitely replay the game in French.    Oops, did I spill the beans already?

{"title": "The New Classics #29: Cotton Reboot!", "date": "23/09/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Back inthe ’80s, some developers grew bored of dark and serious Shoot’em ups, anddecided to shake things up and bring a breath of fresh air to the genre. Thuswas born the Cute’em up subgenre, bringing some much-needed glitz and wackinessto the mix. The Cotton series is oneof the subgenre’s luminaries, along with FantasyZone and Parodius; as for Cotton Reboot, it’s a remake of theoriginal game released in 1991 on a slew of platforms. I love Shoot’em ups, andI adore flashiness; wouldn’t that be a match made in heaven?   The Game: Okay now, I had ablast right from the first second. Cotton is all smooth physics,exhilarating speed and colourful sparkliness — andinstant controls appropriation! It’s also not too technical — meaning that youcan shoot at random and still clear the way. It’s obviously meant to be a gameyou play by instinct, and to have fun without timing your every move.   The ‘TimeAttack’ mode is perfect for getting small bites of shooting — two or fiveminutes, precisely. Then you have the main remastered game, which I obviouslydidn’t complete, and the original X68000version (screenshot above). Now that’s a really interesting addition: not only is it a valuablepiece of gaming history, but it also allows the educated gamer to realiseeverything modern console capabilities bring to the series. The X68000 version,while being quite colourful compared to shooters of that era, remains much moresubdued than the remake. You clearly get the feeling that the series is onlynow reaching its full potential, and will only get better with time.  The Verdict: Nosuspense here, I just discovered myself a New Classic! Now I just wanna make the ultimate stretchand buy Cotton Fantasy: Superlative Night Dreams, the series’ newestcanon exclusive entry. It’s a sure shot, honey!"},

Still, I had good hopes that the sequel would fix these issues — despite a lower Metacritic score than the original. But hey, whocares about aggregated scores when the gaming instinct rules supreme?   The Game: SO DARK! This iswhat came to my mind after a bit of playing. First, I had to crank up mySwitch’s brightness all the way up, because I couldn’t see a darn thing.Secondly, the tenebrous atmosphere hinted at by the cover art is a thingindeed, as most of the action takes place at night or inside shadowy corridors.Last but not least, the story is seriously grim (SPOILERS!), with the MC murdering her father two minutes into thegame and being held at knifepoint five minutes later (END OF SPOILERS).   While I’m not exactly fond of such gloominess, that alone won’t determe from enjoying some good gameplay. And boy, is RQ2’s gameplay good indeed! It doesfix the positioning issues of the original, making combat much smoother andsleeker. The immensepotential strategic depth I spotted in the original entry is very muchalive and well, and levelling-up is just as deliciously fast. Fighting as awhole is a thrilling bit of business,and it wasn’t long before I was murdering everything in sight.   Everythingelse is fun as heck. The game letsyou roam dungeons at breakneck speed and delivers plenty of secret passages,which you can search for yourself or locate thanks to an in-game hint system.The MC is a badass without even trying, the supporting characters are zesty andzany, and everybody looks gorgeous and stylish. Last but not least, the storypacks plenty of intrigue, suspense and dark thrills, and I cannot wait to readit without the Skip mode on.   The onlylow point is the graphics: not only are they too dark for their own good, butthey are also ugly as heck. The first dungeon looks like a ’90s flash game, andthe whole game bristles with pixels so enormous they could pierce your retinas.But being the retro whore I am, I don’t care one bit about crappy graphics —and I care even less when gameplay is thatgood.   The Verdict: NewClassic, yes please! I had good hopes for RQ2,but I didn’t think I would like it thatmuch. Sure, I preferred the sunny andopen vistas of the first game; but I definitely prefer everything else in thatsequel, from the pull-no-punches story to the splendid combat. I secretly hopefor a third entry that would mix everything together; but for now, I’ll enjoythat redeeming second instalment."},

I reasoned that since I owned it, Imight as well play it, and see if itfared better than its 3DS predecessor.  The Game: Of course, I had to have a giant crush on theimpossibly stylish and gorgeous MC. My dream anime character would look a lotlike that — down to the dazzling blue colour palette.Still, I never played a game just for its MC, and I don’t intend to starttoday; so, let’s talk atmosphere and gameplay!  Theformer is not exactly my cup of tea. It’s all the more surprising as the gameopens with a desert setting, and I’m usually very fond of such settings; but SMTV’s arid vistas feel curiously emptyand soulless. In fact, the whole gamefeels empty and soulless, from the menus to the dialogues. I’ve played many dryand barren games, and I’m usually unfazed by such starkness; but SMTV is more than stark — it’s totallydevoid of passion, liveliness and charm.   From whatI’ve understood, this is a staple of sorts of the series: while Persona games are all about glitzinessand memorability, MegaTen games areabout not lifting a finger to charm the player. I’ll take this as a deliberatechoice and move on to the gameplay — and start by saying this: we’re in 2022,and instant save should be mandatory.No exception, no excuses — save points need to die, period.   I somehowexpected a miracle — and there was none. MegaTenis like Dragon Quest: sticking to aformula despite all odds, for the sake of a loyal and grateful fanbase. Everysingle thing that bothered me in SMTIVis alive and well in SMTV, from thestupidly hard battles to the elemental affinity system. A mere two battleswere enough to deplete my MC’s MP bar, and hits would routinely take away aquarter, if not a third, of his HP bar — allthat while playing in easy mode, b*tch. You know I lap up a good challenge,dear fellow gamers; but to me, this qualifies more as an utter loss of time.    The Verdict: MegaTen is such a legendary series thatI was reticent to admit my true feelings at first. But the truth must be faced:SMTV is no New Classic of mine, and Idoubt a canon MegaTen game will everbecome a New Classic of mine. We’ll see if the spinoffs fare better!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #26: Nelke & the Legendary Alchemists", "date": "20/09/2022", "text": "The Backstory: That Atelier spinoff got a lot of flak forstraying from the series’ classic formula andfor being too simple and repetitive. I personally have no issue with a spinoffnot emulating its series’ core gameplay — I mean,that’s the very point of spinoffs — especially when said series happens to be Atelier. As for simple and repetitivegameplay, I like it as a rule — providing that the loop is satisfying. Andanyway, my gaming instinct claimed Nelkedespite the lukewarm reviews, and that’s the only reason I need to play a game.  The Game: Atelier fan service for the faithful isthe name of the game here, as Nelkestars a coterie of famous alchemists from all entries and their sidekicks. Iwouldn’t notice this, though, because: a) I skipped all cutscenes, and b) thenumber of Atelier games I’ve playedcan still be counted on the fingers of one hand. I have to question the logicof that decision, though: is a spinoff the best place to pay homage to a seriesby bringing its full cast? Why not create a dedicated celebratory game starringthe whole crew and the trademark Atelier gameplay? The way I see it, Nelke is trying to appeal to Atelier aficionados with its cast, whileshooting itself in the foot with a gameplay that is bound to sit poorly with any long-time Atelier fan.    Talking about the gameplay, reviews led me to believe that explorationwas entirely automatic, with no input whatsoever from the player. Well, I’mglad — andrelieved — to tell youthat it’s not (entirely) the case. Foragingis now automatic: instead of scouring every corner of wild areas, you watchyour crew run on a path and pocket stuff at random. I can understand the ire ofAtelier fans, and why such adeparture from the classic formula would feel like complete heresy; however, Imust admit that new style doesn’t bother me in the slightest. I actually like it: it’s fast, efficient andsynthetic — the Atelier basics in a nutshell.  Combat, on the other hand, is still fully controlled by the player. You canimagine how overjoyed I was, as fighting is one of my favourite features in Atelier games; but then again, Iunderstand how Atelier fans could beroyally pissed off. So you keep something that appears in basically every RPGunder the sun, yet you oust something that is intrinsic to the Atelier formula? Weird choice indeed,Gust.   But then again, we’re technically not dealing with an Atelier game. It’s not called ‘Atelier Nelke’, but simply ‘Nelke’; and Nelke is not an alchemist,she’s an urban developer-meets-mayor. The player walking in her snug boots issupposed to organise everything and assign tasks to lackeys helpers,rather than do the deed themselves. This gives Nelke’s gameplay a dry, nearly abstract quality very reminiscent ofmanagement games; yet the sheer speedand slickness of the gameplay loop screams ‘phone game’. All in all, Nelke is a weird mix, a game thatdoesn’t know which audience it wants to grab — now, does it grab me?   The Verdict: Well,colour me surprised: I actually like that game! My gaming instinct is playingsmug and chuckling ‘I told you so!’; but honestly, I wasn’t so convinced atfirst. I won’t claim I had the mightiest crush on Nelke; but I certainly like it enough to hold onto it and play moreof it later."},

I alreadyplayed a game boasting such a mix, and it wasn’t great; however, Maglam Lord is developed by Felistellaand published by PQube, which means that I hadto get my paws on it.   The Game: The first major — and pleasant — surprise was how great the characters look, both indialogue and combat sequences. We’re dealing with a rare beast here: a game inwhich the in-game character models look betterthan on the cover art. The female MC is particularly gorgeous and styley — which is exactly why I chose her over the male MC.   Thesecond major (and just as pleasant) surprise was how great combat feels. It’s slick, smooth and intuitive, and it wasn’tlong before I was racking up deadly combos and whirling through the battlefieldlike a deadly wind. Talking about the battlefield, the choice of switchingbetween 3D dungeons and 2D fighting arenas is unusual, and disconcerting atfirst; however, I got used to it real quick. Fighting can be a littlerepetitive, and there is just a tad too much button-mashing involved — butdefinitely not enough to make me swear off the whole thing.  I didn’tplay long enough to uncover other major surprises; but from what I’ve seen, theromance is extremely promising, and the story seems wacky and entertainingenough for my taste. Like many other games I’ve played recently, ML features skippable cutscenes, whichmeans a very happy little me. There shouldbe a law or something that forces developers to make all cutscenes skippable,first play or not!   The onlydownsides I spotted during my play are: a) the fugliness of the very firstdungeon, which looks like a giant pool of vomit, and b) the boring ’20 BearsAsses’ sidequests. However, later dungeons show more promise, and sidequestsare optional — in other words, no biggie.   The Verdict: Maglam Lord is not my gaming crush ofthe century; but it’s definitely a game I wanna play more of, and that’s allI’m asking for. You’re allowed in the collection, buddy!"},

But had I beenin the mood to forge ahead, I would probably have given up later upondiscovering the drawn-out battles. The fighting system as described by my fellow gamer Kina sounds absolutely horrendous, and I braced myself forthe worst upon booting up the sequel — while still hoping that Aquria fixed things insaid sequel.   The Game: I quicklydiscovered that Aquria did fix thefighting system: while the simulation phase still exists, it can now be skippedentirely. Combine this with the Easy mode, and you can just mash buttonswithout ever having to worry about strategy. Needless to say, I lapped this up;in fact, the whole fighting system and combat atmosphere really clicked withme. Fighting is a swift, stylish and addictive affair that quickly got mehooked and put me in the sweetest trance.   Needless to say, this made the very first dungeon — reached quickly after skipping all cutscenes — a delicious pieceof crawling and grinding that left me sated andcraving for more. I left no foe standing, no item unharvested and no cornerunexplored — in a word, I made that dungeon my b*tch, without ever feeling thelassitude mentioned by some reviewers. Sure, that subway rendition wasseriously huge; but it was easy tonavigate, and there were enough things to do there to keep me busy.  I wasless convinced by the following phase, however: roaming an open area full ofNPCs to fulfil Fedex sidequests is not exactly my idea of fun. I’ll be honest:if I cannot find a way to make these phases more palatable (read: skipsidequests entirely), then there is just no future at all for me and CE2.  The Verdict: I adore CE2’s fighting and dungeon roaming, butthe socialization breathers ruin my fun. I should play more to find out if Ican ease these tedious phases; however, I already gave the game its two hoursto shine (that dungeon was hugeindeed). So, here’s my decision: I’ll hold onto CE2, for the sake of crawling & combat. We’ll see in due timeif the rest of the game proves a deal-breaker; but for now, I just cannot let go of that delicious dungeondelight !"},
{"title": "Fuga – Melodies of Steel: Can a digital-only release ruin a game’s career?", "date": "14/09/2022", "text": "After playing Solatorobo, I got curious about the Little TailBronx series it hails from. A bit of research revealed the existence of a veryrecent game in the series: a 2021 release called Fuga: Memories of Steel,which acts as a prequel to Solatorobo and garnered highly favourablereviews from critics and players alike. More research revealed some potentiallyinteresting gameplay mixing elements of SRPG, shooting game and roguelike, aswell as a complex narrative and rich universe. Even more research uncovered thefact that Fuga cost a whopping 2,5 million euros, and was yet notprofitable in December 2021, with sales reaching only a mere million euros.  Such a combination of events was a mystery to me. How could a highlypraised game released on virtually every gaming system available at the timeperform so poorly? While pondering that mystery, I proceeded to purchase Fuga;my interest was piqued, and I wanted to secure it after my short yet glowingexperience with Solatorobo. I quickly discovered that no physicalrelease existed, neither for the Switch nor for any other system; and thus I headedto the Nintendo eShop. But once there, my purchasing impulses were eradicatedon the spot by the game’s price tags: Fuga requires you to fork out 40euros for its normal edition, and no less than 60 euros for its deluxe edition — with no demoincluded, b*tch.   We’re basically talking about a digital game that costs as much as aphysical game — not just on the Switch, but on every platform it’s been released on. Sucha setting is pretty common; however, it mostly applies to major games that alsohave a physical version — with physical being the main release channel. Digital-onlygames tend to be cheaper as a rule, and for good reason: not only are theyoften simpler than games that get a physical release, but they also usually don’ttarget the same audience. And here, I think, lies the main reason Fugasells so poorly: CyberConnect2 simply chose the wrong distribution channel forit, and missed on most of its intended target audience by doing so.   Let’s check the facts, folks: we’re dealing with a game belonging to aconfidential series, with an original and potentially complex gameplay and adeep, heavy story that clashes with the overall cutesy graphics. This is a veryniche proposition; and typically, niche gaming aficionados also favour physicalgames. This is not an absolute law; yet the correlation is very strong.Look no further than yours truly to find an example of it: I’d have secured aphysical version of Fuga in a heartbeat, but I’m balking at the thoughtof buying it digital. And mind you, I’m not the only one: some fellow gamersexpressed the same sentiment in comments in the article I linked above.   There is no doubt that Fuga lost some sales because of itsdigital-only release, and is probably still losing some as we speak. It’simpossible to tell how many; but it may be enough to hurt its career and legacyon the long run. Incidentally, no physical release means less visibility, whichonly makes matters worse. At that point, the best thing CyberConnect2 could doto salvage Fuga would be to release a physical version, and to advertiseit the best they could; otherwise, I’m afraid this game will simply fly underthe radar and disappear quietly.  I’d really, really like to play Fuga. There’s a 25% discount onit as I’m writing this; but is it enough to convince me to cross thedigital-only Rubicon? I’m not sure, honestly. I still have a couple of days toponder the matter; but regardless of my final decision, my hesitation speaksvolumes about the impact of the distribution channel on a game’s sales. Had Fugabeen granted a physical release, the cartridge would already be in mycollection — and mymoney in CyberConnect2’s pockets; instead, I’m agonizing about whether or not Ishould buy it, and I may end up not doing so. That’s a pity, as I love nothingmore than to support little-known developers producing niche works of love; buthonestly, CyberConnect2 kinda shot themselves in the foot with this one."},

A crossover between two series Iadore had to join my preciouscollection upon release, and had tobe played as soon as I got my greedy paws on it!    The Game: Knowing bothseries, there is certainly a ludicrous and over-the-top story to justify themix; however, I skipped cutscenes like it was going out of fashion to get tothe gameplay. I was introduced to a sabre-wielding Neptune wearing Senran Kagura apparel and to a gorgeousatmospheric dungeon, which was already pleasant enough; but then I started to play, and there was no turning back.  Look, that game is the pinnacle of ARPG-meets-Hack’n’Slash.

The game offers an Easy Mode that is just tailor-made for lazy little me— see, Ilove my ARPG on the swift and smooth side, with quick fulfilment and no carpaltunnel syndrome. Handling Neptune felt deliciously effortless and amazinglyintuitive, both in and out of combat; I knew right after five minutes ofrunning and slashing around that I wanted to play much, much more of NxSK.   Such gameplay perfection was neither granted to guaranteed, mind you.Real-time combat in a 3D game world can easily get hairy for a million reason — bad cameramanagement, crappy aiming or wobbly hitboxes, to quote only a few. But NxSK manages not onlyto avoid these pitfalls, but also to deliver some of the most brilliant anddazzling gameplay I’ve ever been treated to. You did it again, Compile Heart!   I didn’t push forward much after that, because I didn’t need any moreconvincing; however, the little I discovered after that — deadly specialskills, convenient aiming, gorgeous animations — onlyserved to convince me impossibly more.

The initially planned Vita release was cancelled by Atlus in2018, and the game remained a PS4 exclusive until it suddenly appeared on theSwitch two months ago. The question is: was it worth the wait, and the pinningfor?   The Game: I quickly noticedsomething I was not aware of: namely, that 13Sis a mix of Visual Novel and RTS. More precisely, it’s a VN with chunks of RTSfighting, which means that the story is the primary focus. That shouldn’t be aproblem given that I love VNs; however, it ended up being a big problem indeed.  The VN segments’ gameplay instantly bothered me. See, I rant every now and then about the lack of interactivity in modern gaming,and about how games shouldn’t forget to give the player agency; and well, it’slike Vanillaware heard my rants and translated them way too literally. Toadvance the plot, you have to: a) walk around and talk to people, b) checkkeywords obtained in dialogue through a dedicated menu, and c) talk to the samepeople again to get more dialogue and keywords — rinse and repeat. This gameplay loop feelsforced and unintuitive, and it comes across as more tedious thanempowering.    I had another, bigger problem: the atmosphere and story didn’t clickwith me at all. See, I love Vanillaware’s signature style as a rule; but 13S’ crepuscular graphics and vistasfailed to please my retinas. I’ve seen enough school settings in games to becompletely blasé about them; and the few narrative developments I witnesseddidn’t whet my appetite.   13S’ combat sessions are perfectly competent and could havesingle-handedly salvaged the game — that is, if I actually fancied RTS. Recent experiences prove that I don’t; and so, 13S’ destiny is pretty much set.    The Verdict: We’retalking about a game that reaped the enviable total of 88 on Metacritic, withuniversal acclaim and scores ranging from 70 to 100; and yet, that game left mecold, which proves one more time that my gaming instinct is the only compass Ineed.

It was one of very fewmanga titles available in Europe in the mid-’90s; yet for some reason, I nevermanaged to get my paws on it. It was also my first introduction to the Elfkind, long before I tackled The Lord of The Rings — and my, what anintroduction that was! Deedlit is easily one of the most recognizable Elves inthe manga/anime realm, despite not being the main character of Lodoss.Although I never got into the series, I couldn’t ignore its mystique; and when Deelitin Wonder Labyrinth appeared, I knew I had to buy it. Yes, it’s aPlatformer, and a Metroidvania to boot; but my gaming instinct claimed it, andthere’s no discussing the gaming instinct’s decisions.   The Game: Oh, boy.Are you kidding me, Ladybug? DWL boasts some of the best physics andcontrols I’ve ever encountered in a Platformer — or in any game, for that matter. I kid you not:the appropriation was instantaneous. Within seconds of first handlingthe titular Elf, I had her whirling around like I’d done that my whole life.The controls and physics are so perfect and impossibly intuitive than the mereaction of moving Deedlit around is enough to make me happy.  Of course, the game offers plenty of other things that make me happy. Lovinglypixelated looks, engrossing atmospheric soundtrack, stimulating puzzles, combatyou never get bored of; and, last but not least, epic boss fights. Look, my firstboss battle in DWL had me hooked right from the first second.  First, the mammoth boss sprite left me gaping at the screen; then, theperfectly handled boss attack patterns made me beam in sheer joy; and finally,the whole boss fight had me enraptured and left me fulfilled like few other bossfights before it. It was the purest essence of what a Platformer boss showdownshould be: a fight where you can use all of your MC’s abilities without feelingforced to, a fight where your reflexes and motor skills are challenged everysecond without ever being overstrained. I honestly cannot wait to discover morebosses — or more ofthe game, for that matter.   The Verdict: It’s notoften I have a crush on a Platformer; but when I do, I usually fall hard.And heck, I fell real, real hard for DWL.

Felistella and/or CompileHeart are always involved one way or another; the series explores several RPGsubgenres through dedicated threads; and, last but not least, each and everyentry proudly boasts outrageous amounts of fan service. Another thing I know isthat these games ooze charm despite being technically imperfect, and that I’vetried to secure as many of them as I could over the years. I was pretty miffedthe original Seven Pirates entrynever made it to our shores; so when the sequel graced the Switch with Englishincluded, I immediately pounced. Shut up and take my money, Compile Heart!   The Game: You know, I just lovewhen games go straight to the point and let you play early on; and boy, did 7PHhumour me indeed. After a skippable introductory cutscene, I was let loose inthe game world, free to slaughter respawnable foes to my heart’s content. Oh,the absolute joy! Once I was sated, I proceeded to advance the game; a merehour later, I knew all the main gameplay mechanics and had more than half of mycrew recruited. Now that is some serious speedy efficiency, folks.   Going fast is all well and nice, but how does the gameplay fare?Pretty well indeed. The gameplay loop is simple, yet quite complete andaddictive. On top of tiny dungeons à la Hyperdimension Neptunia andbasic turn-based combat with (beautifully animated) super-skills, the gameoffers side quests, harvesting and crafting options and, last but not least,the series’ trademark — a fan-servicey stat-raising feature! There is also a story in there — although Iwouldn’t know, because I dutifully skipped all cutscenes. I may well follow thething once I play the game for real, though; Moe Chronicle’s pervy storyturned out to be surprisingly thoughtful and touching, so maybe 7PH’sstory packs some pleasant surprises as well.  One thing I didn’t expect from that game, and got nonetheless, is amodicum of strategic depth. The very first boss battle — which happens roughly five minutes afterstarting the game, en passant — is hardly winneable unless you unleash your super skill. Said superskill becomes available one the associated gauge reaches 200; the best courseof action is thus to fill up the gauge to roughly 190 through random battlesbefore proceeding to the boss fight. It’s a simple trick, yet quite rewarding.With extra party members come more strategic choices. Like, should you have thewhole crew gang up on the boss, or should you let only one or two units attackswhile the rest defends, in order to rack up points for triggering super skills?It all boils down to your playing style, really. 7PH seems to be an easygame, as fan-servicey titles should be as far as I’m concerned; I may be wrong,but I don’t think this game will ever punish you for not sticking to a veryprecise course of action.  Last but not least, 7PH is a heart-warming game. Not only is itvisually appealing, with its bright and vibrant colours, but it’s also lively, saucyand zesty. It doesn’t take itself too seriously, and it’s obviously intent onmaking the player happy; I love such intentions, and I’d be more than enjoysome quality time with 7PH.   The Verdict: I had aninkling I was going to love that game; however, I didn’t anticipate how friggin’ much I would love it.

Given that I lovecute little roguelikes and physical games, I had to secure Crown Trick;and when my gaming instinct claimed it for immediate play, I obeyed with goodgrace.   The Game: Hello darkness my old friend! With itsnightmare theme, its barely lit dungeons and gloomy soundtrack, CT sure isn’t bound to put a gamer in abubbly mood. I prefer bright colours and mellow atmospheres as a rule; so thatdark-ish artistic direction left me unimpressed. I’m not fond of cartoonishlooks in games either; I mean, if I wanted to feat my eyes on some cartoon art,I’d just watch cartoons. Gimmethem pixels! But there is more to a game than mere aesthetics, especiallyin this gamer’s eyes; let’s talk gameplay, folks!   Well, it’s certainly a roguelike. I was confused at first by reviewsdescribing the game as a mix of SRPGand roguelike — that is, until I realised that the ‘SRPG’ mention mostly meant thatthe game operates on a turn-based system, with grid-based battle areas. It mayalso be a reference to CT’s carefuland deliberate brand of combat, which is very reminiscent of your average SRPG.Now that didn’t sit well with me, folks; as you know from recent reviews, I’vebecome somewhat allergic to molasses-like fights in RPGs.   I have nothing to say about procedurally generated levels and therandomness of weapon and item drops, because these are lovely staples of thegenre. On the other hand, I have a lot tosay about the controls and physics. See, both manage to be at once stiff and slippery, which is quite a featindeed. As a result, I always felt on edge when playing — and not for theright reason. The thing is, roguelikes are so tough as a rule that they requiretight, pitch-perfect controls and physics; no roguelike player needs an addedlayer of fake difficulty on top of the real thing.   The Verdict: I can’tsay I hated my time with Crown Trick:I mean, I gave the thing its two hours to shine, and I sure didn’t get boredduring that time. However, now that I turned my Switch off, I don’t feel likeever coming back to that game. No matter the hype and the stellar reviews, CT and I are simply not meant together."},
{"title": "The New Classics #18: Heroes of Mana", "date": "08/09/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Just likeSolatorobo, Heroes of Mana was part of my very first batch of DS games, and canbe spotted on my logo picture. I ordered it alongside Children of Mana; but while I played the latter way back on 2012,before I even started that blog, HoMstayed untouched until now. Same sending, different destinies! And talkingabout destinies, will HoM join CoM to the pawn shop?    The Game: Right off thebat, I was disappointed by the atmosphere — or lack thereof. The Seiken Densetsu signaturegraphical style was present, but not enough.Character portraits lacked sharpness and detail, colours lacked vibrancy andvividness, and the whole thing lacked that unmistakable Mana zest and zing.  Still, that wouldn’t have been enough to deter me from playing, hadthe gameplay been stellar. But again, things unravelled pretty quickly — namely, the verymoment I realised I was dealing with anRTS rather than with an RPG. Now, I’ve seen enough fellow gamers play RTSon PC to know that the genre is not for me; and HoM only cemented that perception. This is the very antithesis ofwhat I love in gaming: fast-paced action, red-hot combat and sweet repetitionthat puts you in a trance. After watching my units crawl along the first mapfor 20 minutes to gather a handful of resources, I knew for sure HoM and I were not meant to rolltogether.      The Verdict: Nosurprise here, Heroes of Mana is no NewClassic of mine. At that point, I should probably ditch the series altogether;but I won’t. Instead, I’ll give every entry I own the New Classic treatment; andhopefully I’ll find something that will redeem the series in my jaded eyes."},

FFTA2 also happens to be one of the very first RPGs I purchasedfor my brand-new DS, back in 2012; and just like Tactics Ogre, itremained untouched for a good ten years. Now FFTA2 got it chance toshine, and we’ll see if it did.   The Game: Oh gosh, thatgame is absolutely splendid. I could honestly stare at these gorgeousgraphics all day; the very first foe, that big fat birdie, left me gaping atthe screen with stars in my eyes. I was also really fond of the uber-faststart, which catapulted my MC straight into a red-hot battle after a short andsweet introductory cutscene.  Actually, take that back: ‘red-hot’ is not exactly the appropriateword. More like not at all, really. Combat is slow as molasses — even slower than TacticsOgre, which was already painfully slow. As much as I love the graphics andoverall atmosphere, I just cannot stand that sluggish gameplay.   The Verdict: Nosuspense here, FFTA2 and I are not meant together. I’m honestly a bitsad; but given that I already had trouble reaching the end of the first battle,there is no way in heck I can stomach more of them just to get some eye-candy."},
{"title": "The New Classics #16: Tactics Ogre", "date": "05/09/2022", "text": "The Backstory: TacticsOgre was the very first game I purchased for my brand-new PSP, way back in2013. I remember everything: how I spotted that game in the appliance store andthought the cover art looked insanely neat and tempting, how I secured thething and went back home, happy to have started my PSP collection… And how Ileft the game untouched for nearly 10 years after that. Mind you, it would havestayed untouched for even longer if not for my fellow gamer Sieg’s prompt toplay it; now the deed is done, and here come my impressions.  The Game: Not gonna lie,the art and character design are pure eye-candy. Indecently and jaw-droppinglygorgeous would be closer to the truth; Yasumi Matsuno sure masters his craft, andknows how to make a gamer swoon and drool over a mere picture. However, I’m notone to play an RPG just to gaze as character portraits, no matter how splendidthey are. So, how does the story fare?  Pretty well, shall I say. We sure have a deep and engaging storythere: I can spot from afar meaty character development, complex relationshipsand intricate politics by the truckload. It might actually be a tad tooconvoluted of a story for me, as I got a bit lost already in the earlystages; but I’m confident I could follow it if I put my mind to it. Now, I’mnot one to play an RPG just to follow a story, no matter how fascinating it is.So, how does the gameplay fare?  Oh boy, oh boy. Let’s be honest here:everything unravelled right from the first battle. Why, oh why, does fightingneed to be so painfully slow? I realised I’ve been seriously spoiled by Fire Emblem and its quality-of-play acceleratingoptions and resulting fast-paced battles, and that I just cannot stand to watch combatprogress at molasses-like speed. I was already screaming for mercy by the endof the first fight, and I couldn’t imagine going through another one — let alone another 50.   The Verdict: I gave TacticsOgre an honest try, and it boasted some goodness I genuinely loved;however, this is definitely not the game that will save the genre for me. I’m abit sad, because I would have loved to adore my first PSP game; but this willbe a Game Boy case instead. At least, I won’t force Tactics Ogre onmyself and let it scar me for life like friggin’ Super Mario Land — and so: thank you,next!"},
{"title": "All the games I adored, yet won’t play again", "date": "04/09/2022", "text": "I promised it not so long ago, and here it comes! I thought thesegames were Cult Classics of Mine, because I enjoyed playing them so darn much;but I realise now that they were actually once-in-a-lifetime experiences — which is mighty fine too. And so I’ll part with them, with a fewwords as a heartfelt goodbye! Final Fantasy Legend II: That spinoff was oneof my most memorable Game Boy runs — a feat made all the more memorable by thefact that I didn’t play it as a starry-eyed kid in 1991, but rather as aseasoned RPG aficionado in 2014. It was a mad challenge that I totallyrelished; but I also remember that it roughed me up like crazy, and that I camevery close to quitting a couple of times. I didn’t complain at the time; but Isure as heck don’t want to relive the whole thing either.   Shiren the Wanderer: I had the most amazing time withthe first Shiren entry. It was an epic ride full of elation and despair,joy and sorrow. The highs were deliriously high, the lows were soul-crushinglylow; and I can safely claim that very few games I’ve played were such arollercoaster of feels. Any second run of Shiren would pale compared tothat first one — and heck, I really don’t want to endure such brutality again.   Legacyof Ys – Books I&II / Ys I&II Chronicles: Playing that pair delighted both the gaming historian and the ARPGaficionado in me. However, I have to face the truth: not only have I forgottennearly everything about these games, but they also cannot hold a candle toother ARPGs and Hack’n’Slashes that are Cult Classics of Mine.    Final Fantasy: The original Final Fantasywas a delirious grinding fest from beginning to end, and I completely lapped itup. However, as far as grindy turn-based RPGs go, I can think of a thousandtitles that I’d rather play — starting with my whole posse of Kemco budget RPGs.   Popolocrois: I absolutely adored that game back in thedays. It was lovely and heart-warming, with a sweet nostalgic atmosphere thatstayed with me long after I finished it. Playing it made me feel good, and Icannot remember a single thing that bothered or annoyed me. For the longesttime, I kinda wanted to replay it; but that desire is now gone, and I don’tthink it will ever come back.     Riviera– The Promised Land: Just like Popolocrois,Riviera really charmed the pants off me when I played it. It wasabsolutely unique back in the days, and still is; I loved every minute of it,and I don’t have a single negative thing to say about it. I wrote an amazinglylong post about that first Dept. Heaven offering, and it still has plenty tooffer me; and yet, I never felt even the slightest urge to replay it once myrun was over, and I still don’t.    Astonishia Story: Man, I owe a lot to that game.It was the first game to awaken my gaming ferweh after my Second Coming of Gaming, and one of very few modern games that awoke the raw emotions I usedto feel when I started gaming (other such games being Legend of Legacyand Arc of Alchemist). That first run was truly magical; and I’mafraid any subsequent run would feel more mundane, and only serve to revealsome flaws while bringing nothing of value to my gamers’ soul.   Trails in the Sky: I should have hated that game forits slow, strategy-infused combat, its indolent pacing and its emphasis onstory; and yet, a miracle somehow happened, and I ended up adoring it. Like,really friggin’ adoring it. I still feel mushy just thinking of it; but I alsofeel just as strongly that I shouldn’t ever come close to it again.   MoeChronicles: I had some darn good fun withthat game. However, and despite my undying love for FPDCs, I don’t feellike replaying it, ever. I’d gladly lose myself again in The Lost Child,Dungeon Travelers 2 or Demon Gaze; but Moe Chroniclesleans more on the Class of Heroes side — an acquired taste that I canlive without.  Bravely Default: Definitely one of the most intenselyoriginal and memorable RPGs I’ve played, boasting what is probably my favouriteclass system of all times (coming from someone who dislike class systems as arule). Unforgettable aesthetics and atmosphere, and the most insane boss rushI’ve ever tackled. Heck, just writing all this makes me wanna play BravelyDefault again; and yet, deep down, I know I’ll never get down toit.    Legend of Legacy: Playing that game was a deeplymoving experience for me: it offered me acompletely unique mix of feels, impressions and emotions I neverencountered in any game before, or since. And yet, something is lacking;something that could make me wanna play Legend of Legacy again. The oldme would have tried to analyse what that ‘something’ was, but the new me knowsthat it won’t change jack sh*t — and so, I’ll just accept these feelings andmove on. That’sall for the time being; but who knows, maybe other games will join that club,as I realise over time that I don’t wanna replay them despite loving them topieces. At any rate, I’m happy I can now feel that way about a game: it meansthat I’m finally reaching a place of solace in my gaming career, and that I’mdone with the need to cling obsessively to every single game I love. Some are meantto be lifelong companions, some are meant to stick around for a while, and someare meant to be cameos — and hey, it’s mighty fine that way!"},
{"title": "Dabbling in Demos: Monster Hunter Rise – Sunbreak", "date": "03/09/2022", "text": "My first foray into the legendary monster-slaughtering series didn’t go well. I steered clear of it after that, only daring to purchase a couple ofspinoffs I have yet to play; but for some reason, my gaming instinct suddenlywanted to try the thing again after seven years. I know better than to fightthe gaming instinct’s flights of fancy; however, years of gaming purchases havemade me wiser, and I reasoned than a demo would be more than enough to satiatemy gaming instinct’s curiosity. A few hours later, I found myself playing the demo for the newest Riseextension — which you can play without owning Rise,surprisingly enough. I picked a randomcharacter that looked good — fickle gamer is fickle —and proceeded to find the beast I was ordered to slaughter. The game describedthat hunt as a mission for beginners, and I was fully confident I could do thedeed.  Twothings immediately blew my mind. The first is that you can go absolutely anywhere,and you don’t die from high falls — I’m rolling my eyes at you, Breath ofthe Wild. I don’t like open worlds as a rule; but I have to admit that360-degree roaming is a thing of beauty and awesomeness. It’s not like reallife, it’s better than real life, because real-life physics won’t letyou perform the kind of stunts Sunbreak allows — like, I was sure asheck that reckless jump down a waterfall would kill me; but I landed safe andsound, and could run right away like nothing had happened.   The second thing that blew my mind is how darn sluggish thephysics are. Are you kidding me, Capcom? Am I really supposed to hunt wildbeasts with such slow reflexes? My character felt like a ten-tonne truck — or, more precisely, it felt like what it actually was: acreature trying to run while decked in a full set of armour and carrying a hugesword on its back. The thing is, I hate when developers play itrealistic with some parts of a game’s physics while making other partscompletely bonkers. This is the Valkyria Chronicles 4 story allover again; why on earth implement no-damage jump, if you’re going to ruin itwith impeded sprint?    Rantingsabout physics aside, it took me five real-life minutes to reach the beast ofinterest. I don’t fancy running around for minutes in RPGs — and I fancy iteven less when I get knocked out cold after thirty seconds of tedious fighting.Why, thank you, game! I blame my resounding defeat on the aforementionedsluggish physics — even though deep down, I know my shitty motor skills and exclusivelove for lightning-fast real-time combat are to blame. I have neither theability nor the desire to master Monster Hunter’s deliberate and leadenbrand of physics — as a matter of fact, I didn’t even give the mission a secondtry.  The end! MonsterHunter Rise is a gorgeous game for sure; but justlike its predecessor, it’s clearly not made for me. I have good hopes that the Storiesspinoffs will suit me better, though — good thing I have them lined up for theNew Classic test! I’ll see you later with plenty of gaming goodness, dearfellow gamers; in the meantime, keep doing your thing and take care!"},

Thecover art alone had me sold, along with the mysterious and evocative title; sowhen Crystar popped up on the Switch, I pounced and secured a copy withno delay. And since I had been pinning for that game for so long, I proceededto put it to the New Classics test as soon as the plastic was removed.   The Game: My retinas becameCrystar’s b*tches right from the first second of gameplay. Thesegorgeous colours! This dreamy atmosphere! Moar! At least the cover artis not lying (I’m looking at you, Cogen) and the in-gameaesthetics are totally consistent with said cover. Then you have the strikingin medias res story, which is bound to leave you heartbroken before thefirst half-hour is over. Not gonna spoil anything, but I get some strong Izanagi& Izanami vibes from that story, mixed with a whiff of Made in Abyss; and with such a slap-in-the-face start, I’m morethan eager to make it to the last floor.   Graphics and story are all well and nice, but a game lives and dies byits gameplay. And boy oh boy, is Crystar lively in that department. Adelicious hack’n’slashy fighting system with automatic positioning and aiming?Now you really wanna make me hooked, game. How can I resist, when I like everythingabout you? Well I can, because I’m in a New Classics frenzy and plenty of othergames are waiting.  The Verdict: Nosuspense whatsoever here, Crystar is here to stay. I haven’t felt such amassive and instant crush for a game for quite some time, and I’ll be more thanhappy to dive into Crystar again in due time. Thanks a lot for bringingthat sparkling gem to the Switch, NIS America!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #14: Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles", "date": "01/09/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Do I needto present Castlevania? Of course I don’t. What I need to mention, onthe other hand, is that CDXC is my very first foray into that mythicalseries. It seems that all the legendary Platformers of the ‘80s and ‘90s passedme by for some unfathomable reason — said reason not being my enduring dislike ofPlatformers, given that there was little else to play at the time. But Idigress; will CDXC mark the beginning of a new burning love story, orwill it join the graveyard of Platformers that failed to click with me?   The Game: Although I hadyet to touch some Castlevania before booting up CDXC, the series wasnot completely unknown to me. I’ve watched a number of playthroughs ofdifferent entries on Youtube over the years; and so, I kinda knew what toexpect in terms of atmosphere and gameplay.  Let’s start with the former, shall we? I’ll be honest: I totallydislike the whole vampire-meets-goth shebang. I thus knew that if I ended uploving Castlevania, it would be despite the vampire theme and notbecause of it. And well, there was no miracle: I indeed disliked what I saw.What I expected to like, on the other hand, was the soundtrack; not only is theseries immensely famous for its music, but I really liked it when I watched Castlevaniavideos on Youtube. However, once I played the game, I found out that thesoundtrack grated on my ears, and even prevented me from focusing efficientlyat times. And mind you, I needed all the focus I could muster to make it throughthe game. Although CDXC is not nearly as tough-as-nails as I feared, itremains difficult enough to give me trouble. It’s just as stiff as I expectedfrom watching gameplay videos; and while cracking the whip is really darn fun,there are just way too many booby traps and foes all over the place for mytaste. Said foes move constantly, and they move fast; getting rid ofthem requires precise timing, which in turn requires good motor skills — which I totallydon’t have, as we all know.  Boss battles, on the other hand, are nearly too easy. I fought adragon with uber-predictable attack patterns, which moved so indolently that Inearly fell asleep on my PSP. All the thrill you normally expect from a bossbattle was totally absent; I swear I struggled more with the knight throwingaxes in level 2 than with that dragon boss.   The Verdict: CDXCis a perfectly decent game with a reasonable difficulty level, a game I couldsee myself finish given how I managed to progress… But alas, I have no interestwhatsoever in progressing more, let alone in actually finishing that game. Ican understand the series’ appeal, but I cannot feel it in my thumbs andmy gamer’s soul."},
{"title": "The New Classics #13: Knights in the Nightmare", "date": "31/08/2022", "text": "The Backstory: The DSversion of that game was one of the first additions to my then buddingcollection, back in 2012 — if you check my logo picture featuring a space invader sprite createdwith DS games, you’ll spot it amongst the crew. The cover art and the title immediatelystruck my fancy; and my interest only grew when I fell in love with Sting afterplaying Riviera, Hexyz Force, Pandora’s Reflection and Dungeon Travelers 2.Yet, my gaming instinct never compelled me to play that game — but things aredifferent now. My fellow gamer Sieg suggested it in The List’s comments; andsince I promised to play all games suggested by my fellow gamers in thatcontext, KitN’s time has (finally)come.    The Game: I first rolledwith the PSP version; however, I quickly realised things were not going towork. Not only did the constant loading times piss me off, but the controlscheme instantly ruffled my feathers. It was deeply counterintuitive andclumsy; and I couldn’t help but think right away that KitN’s gameplay just screamed“touchscreen controls”. I thus booted up the DS version; and joy and glory,everything felt perfect right away.With no loading time whatsoever and a deliciously intuitive and slick controlscheme, I was on a roll.   Or not quite, actually. KitN’sfirst entry on the title screen is called “Teachings”, which speaks volumes:we’re dealing with a game sporting a complex gameplay that cannot be explainedin a single tutorial — nor in two or three, for that matter. Said complex gameplay must beapprehended before diving into the game, and mastered to some extent. Thisbothered me: given the number of tutorials, I wasn’t sure I could clear themall and play some main game in two hours or less. And yet, I had no choice: Itried launching a new game, and couldn’t figure out a thing in battle. I neededto play these tutorials no matter what; and so I did.    I read and played the whole tutorial section not once, but twice. Oncethat was done, I was left with two thoughts: a) that’s some seriously meaty andhairy gameplay we have here, and b) I totally wanna play more of it. I launcheda new game, cried in joy upon discovering that cutscenes could be skipped,skipped them all thinking I’d come back to them when I played the game proper,fought my first battle… And got my arse completely handed to me. Crestfallenmuch? You bet! But I tried again, and everything clicked when I figured outsomething important I hadn’t fully understood despite the mass of tutorials.(For those who know the game: I though dragging a weapon over a Knight wasenough to equip said weapon, and didn’t realise you had to hold the weaponthere to charge Skills. I was thus attacking with the base weapon and dealing 2points of damage, and couldn’t finish a single foe.) I was delighted; and asthe two-hour mark was drawing close, I decided to stop there.   The Verdict: I’ve seenand played enough of Knights in theNightmare to know that I wanna play much more of it. I wanna fight morebattles, get myself more of that sweet bullet hell and work my magic with thestylus. I wanna read the story, recruit plenty of Knights, and learn more aboutthe strikingly mysterious Armoured Maiden. Last but not least, I wanna see moreof these splendid graphics, and bask in KitN’sunique atmosphere. This is the first time I encounter a game that manages to bedark and colourful, grim and light-hearted at once; I can’t fathom how Sting’sProduct team A managed to pull that one off, but I sure wanna honour their workby playing much more of it. The PSP version sadly has to go, because I cannotstomach the loading times and the controls; but the DS version is very muchhere to stay."},
{"title": "The New Classics #12: Shin Megami Tensei IV", "date": "30/08/2022", "text": "The Backstory: ANorth-American-only physical release, which I imported way back in the days.I’ve long overcome the need to recoup every single game investment; and so, Ican allow myself to be fully honest towards that game. I kinda knew the series’basic gameplay mechanics, which are supposedly similar to the ones at work inmy beloved The Lost Child; and so, I fully expected to have a blast withSMTIV.   The Game: I certainly had ablast at first; I liked the game’s quick introduction and short tutorials, andI liked even more the fact that I was let loose in a dungeon after fifteenminutes of play. I wanted nothing more than to roam that dungeon to my heart’scontent; however, the game was not exactly ready to humour me.   See, SMTIV is hard. Like, ‘save every 30 seconds’ hard;like, ‘every battle could be your last’ hard. Mind you, I’m perfectly fine withthat, as long as the game does allow me to save every 30 seconds — which SMTIVnicely does. However, it doesn’t stop there; it’s also ‘you need to strategizeevery step of the way’ hard. Foes are so powerful, even in the early stages,that using the elemental complementarity system to the fullest is kinda mandatoryto win battles — or to survive them, for that matter. And guess what? I don’t likethat, oh nooo precious.   What I like even less is the fact that recruited demons evaporateand disappear from my party when they are knocked out cold. I don’t rememberthis happening in my beloved The Lost Child, which means that: a) fainted demons mercifully don't disappear in TLC, or b) TLC is so easy that my demons didn’t faint evenonce. In SMTIV, it takes a mere two blows to send a demon packing; andas recruitment is a bit tedious, you can’t replace them on the fly as smoothlyas you’d like.     The Verdict: I wasleft a bit disoriented and unsatisfied by my first foray into the MegaTenseries. Combat feels kinda tedious, the demon collection gimmick really doesn’tresonate with me, and the game’s brand of ‘hard’ is not my cup of tea. Mindyou, I’m not swearing off the series yet; now that I know what to expect, I’llgive each entry a quick try, and see if some of them strike my fancy. At anyrate, SMTIV is no cult classic of mine; and as it’s a North-Americangame, I’ll gladly let it go."},

The first ever Dragon Questentry, which has been ported on so many platforms that I own two versions of italready. Of course, I had to decide which version to play first; and since I’min a bit of a retro mood, I choose the North-American Game Boy Colour versionknown as Dragon Warrior. Upon booting up the cartridge, I noticed thatthe battery was depleted; yet that could easily be fixed, as my favouritegaming shop offers battery changes. But first, I had to determine if the gamewas worth said change; and so, I polished off my two hours of play in one go.    The Game: Oh joy, oh glory!Right from the first frame, I was immerged in that retro goodness I love somuch. The graphics were so deliciously Game Boy, and the music… Look, Inearly cried with happiness upon hearing these splendid chiptunes. It certainlydoesn’t hurt that the melodies are pure ear-candy — especially the overworld theme, which I couldlisten to for hours.   I kinda did, actually. I was let loose in the game world after the shortestbriefing from the resident king, with nothing to halt me bar the levels ofroaming enemies. Oh, to be free in an RPG again! I could explore the world atmy own pace, and I first settled on a clear-cut objective: to get the funds topurchase the Copper sword. That goal was reached slowly but surely throughslime eradication, and I could finally get that coveted sword and progress abit further on the game world.  I wanted nothing more than to keep exploring while pursuing suchnicely simple goals; but alas, the two allotted hours came to pass, and I hadto bid my run adieu. My next goal regarding that game is most definitely to geta new battery; and the next goal after that is to play the whole thing.  The Verdict: Nosuspense here, we have a New Classic on our hands! I’ll obviously hold ontothat Game Boy Colour version; and I’ll also keep the Switch one while I’m atit, because why not. I’ll play you again, Dragon Warrior!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #10: Forward to the Sky", "date": "28/08/2022", "text": "The Backstory: I bought Forwardto the Sky based on its graphics and title alone, without knowing anythingabout the gameplay. I just had a crush on the sky vistas, and the title soundedinspiring enough; upon booting up the game, I was introduced to the notion ofclimbing a tower to reach the big baddie, and that concept instantly clickedwith me. Whether we’re dealing with a tower or an abyss, I just love thenotion of making your way through millions of floors.   The Game: I fully expected FttSto play like a dungeon crawler; however, I quickly realised that despite thefloor gimmick, it’s actually much closer to an action-adventure game à la TombRaider. You have dungeons puzzles by the truckload, booby traps, fullyobvious traps, platforms, and a couple of foes lounging around for good measure;and you have to climb your way up, ever up.    That’s a simple enough concept; and I usually dig simple concepts. Thefirst level was really pleasant: I ran, jumped and climbed around, makemincemeat of the resident foes, solved nice puzzles, collected a ton of prettyblue crystals, and generally enjoyed myself. I was ready to holler ‘NewClassic’ and keep climbing; however, the second level destroyed my enthusiasmbefore I was even done with it.  Indeed, the cracks showed very blatantly in that second level. Thewobbly physics and the awkward camera angles made me fall prey to some vicioustraps I could have waltzed around with better physics and camera angles; andcombat fully revealed its half-baked and inept nature as I was confronted withstronger foes. After plunging to my death a dozen times, losing a ton of healthto enemies whose hits landed every time while mine didn’t seem to make contact,and solving a couple of boring puzzles, I called it quit and turned of thegame.  The Verdict: Nosuspense here: not only is Forward to the Sky no New Classic of mine,but it’s actually a pretty bad game overall. The two existing reviews onMetacritic produce an average score of 35; and unlike my beloved Arc ofAlchemist, I feel FttS fully deserves that low score. Next please!"},
{"title": "The New Classics: Progress Report #3", "date": "27/08/2022", "text": "The unthinkable just happened, dear fellow gamers: I’m done putting my whole Switch collection to the New Classictest! (‘My whole Switch collection’ means all my physical Switch games, barvisual novels; and it represents a good 80% of all my Switch games.) If I dosay so myself, that’s one serious mammoth achievement.  Shameless self-praise aside, this first major New Classics sessiontaught me a number of important lessons, such as: —     I don’t like SRPGs. Discoveringthe genre through isolated games such as Luminous Arc and Stella Glow was nice enough; but SRPG gameplayas a whole really turns me off. The only SRPG series I genuinely enjoy is Fire Emblem — but with perma-death off,please.   —     The New Classic modus operandiis just perfect to save some time. I kinda enjoyed some games while playingthem, and I thought they could be worthy of the New Classic title; however, amere couple of days — sometimes hours — were enough for them to evaporateentirely from my gamer’s soul. Had I kept playing these games instead of justtesting them, I would ultimately have lost precious playing hours, because theywould have left no imprint whatsoever once the run was over. In fact, my gamingcareer is full of such games, from Rhapsodyto Suikoden Tierkreis; I have no moretime and energy to devote to such fleeting, half-hearted experiences. —     Some of mypotential New Classics may not be New Classics after all — meaning, I might play them once and enjoy them tremendously, andyet never feel like touching them again after that. The perfect example of sucha situation is Trails in the Sky: Ihad a blast playing it, I’m immensely glad I did, and I’ll never forget my runof that game; yet at the same time, I’m starting to realise that I’ll probablynever replay it — I feel it, deep inmy gamer’s soul. I’m accepting that new category gladly — and you can totallyexpect an upcoming post lining up all the games I adored yet won’t play again.  —     I’m finallyreaching a more peaceful stage of my gaming career. After my Second Coming of Gaming, I spent literal years makingup for all the lost time, for all my accumulated gaming frustrations, in whatcan only be described as a manic frenzy of collecting and playing. I needed that phase to heal my gamer’ssoul — and hey, it was mad fun to boot! I’m serene andcontent now, and I can take it easy — or easier, if you will. I can stoppurchasing every single RPG under the gaming sun, I can stop trying my hardestto enjoy every single game I purchase. I don’t need to love all entries in my favourite series, I don’t need to finish every game I start. Just let the gaminginstinct do its thing, baby!    As for the next steps, they’re pretty clear: to apply theNew Classic treatment to every sub-collection of mine! Next in line is the3DS/2DS, just because my gaming instinct says so. Kinda unrelated, but did younotice that I published every evening for the last couple of days?

{"title": "Dabbling in Demos: Kirby and the Forgotten Land", "date": "26/08/2022", "text": "Hullo, dear fellow gamers; hope you’re doing just as fine as me, andgaming like the wind like me! I have my hands — andfingers — full with the NewClassics project; but that won’t prevent me from dabbling in other gamingpursuits. See, I’m sometimes curious about some games, but not nearly enough tocommit to a purchase; and that’s where demos neatly and conveniently come intoplay. I just discovered the sheer abundance of Switch demos, and I’m totallyplanning to make good use of it; and along that good use comes a brand-newfeature, which is bound to reappear regularly on that blog.   So, let’s get started! I replayed the original entry lately, and I wasquite curious to try the latest — 30 years is quite a stretch, ain’t it? Not gonnalie: the bright colours and gorgeous vistas totally wowed me, and won me overimmediately. I was further won over by the controls, which are just asdeliciously intuitive as the controls from the original game. That series sureknows how to lure players in! To crown that goodness, I was treated to Kirby’smany delightful transformations — I swear I laughedaloud when the creature transformed into a soda vending machine spitting cans.   I had thetime of my life handling Kirby in the titular forgotten land… for exactlyfifteen minutes. Then, I suddenly felt I had seen, and enjoyed, everything thegame had to offer me — cue that lastword. This is a great game; but fifteen minutes of Kirby is all I need to be fulfilled. That is roughly the time Ineed to clear a full run of Kirby’s DreamLand, King ‘fake longevity’Dedede not included; and that is why KDLremains the ultimate and unsurpassable Kirbyentry as far as I’m concerned. Until the next demo, dear fellow gamers, take care andkeep doing your thing!"},
{"title": "Ducktales: It’s a rich duck’s world", "date": "25/08/2022", "text": "Aaah, Ducktales. My thirdGame Boy game, which came to join my budding collection right after Super Mario Land and Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle. A game thatfeatures one of my favourite cartoon characters of that era, a character I’mstill quite fond of — if only because of sheer nostalgia. A game that, just like Kirby’s Dream Land, is giving me thatsweet feeling of completion I cannot get from the New Classic sessions.   Or not quite, actually. The thing is, I cannot reliably polish off Ducktales,even after all these years and runs; there is simply no telling whether I’llfeast my eyes on the final boss when I boot up the game. See, Ducktalesis really not that easy. One reason is that just like its MC, this gameis real stingy: there is no Continue whatsoever, extra lives are a precious fewand viciously hidden, and you start with a measly three lives and three HPpoints. You can reap two hidden HP points over the course of your adventure,and the game is a tad more forgiving if you play in Easy Mode; however, thatain’t enough to guarantee a smooth run, let alone a successful one. Indeed, there is a worse hindrance at work in that game: the jumps,folks. Ducktales boasts pretty tight and reliable controls overall — which makes theviciousness of the jumps all the more blatant. These jumps are designedto be deadly, to act as run-enders; and man, do they excel at that nastyjob. Not every single jump in Ducktales is potentially fatal, mind you;just a chosen few of them — which makes them all the more horribly memorable. Every level has atleast one series of such jumps: the Flagada Jones ride in the Amazon, the wagontrip in Transylvania, the chasms in the African Mines, the crevasses in TheHimalayas — and lastbut not least, the blocks on the Moon. Oh gosh, those blocks. Manya hope of a successful run died on these blocks back in the days, and theysingle-handedly destroyed a couple of promising recent runs — that is, until Ihad an epiphany and suddenly remembered the existence of that secret passageat the right of the remote control room, which allows you to bypass thoseblocks entirely. And gosh, the way that memory emerged from the deepestrecesses of my mind was so darn satisfying.    Did the jumps in Ducktales kinda traumatize me? You bet! Butfortunately, there is more to that game than nasty jumps. There is a kickasssoundtrack, an awesome atmosphere, and great controls; and last but not least,there is the thrill of collecting diamonds and treasures all around the world àla Indiana Jones. Ducktales is not stingy with items, that’s for sure:the whole game is full to the brim with stuff hidden everywhere — in safes andblocks, but also in scenery elements, and even in thin air. Hitting tree stumpsand graves with your walking stick produces diamonds (and sometimes foes), andjumping around can make items pop into existence. The whole treasure-searchingtheme is so ingrained in Ducktales that the usual score is replaced by amoney count, which increases as you greedily pocket gems and treasures;not only does is that design choice more engaging that a mere, abstract score,but it’s perfectly consistent with the game’s MC and the series’ spirit. Cherryon the cake: if you collect ten million dollars, you’ll be rewarded by a finalscene showing Scrooge McDuck jumping with joy next to a giant safe overflowingwith diamonds — needless to say, I lapped up that scene as a kid.  And I played an extra run just to see that scene again. Long story short: I loved that game back in the days, and Istill do. It’s not as easy as I’d like, and it still roughs me up more than I’dwish; but I have a fondness for it, a fondness that will probably endure untilmy dying day. It’s an unforgettable part of not only my gaming career, but alsomy childhood; and it remains my favourite licensed game ever.I’ll see you again, Scrooge McDuck — and so will I see you soon with more gaminggoodness, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #9: Death End re;Quest", "date": "24/08/2022", "text": "The Backstory: I wantedCompile Heart and Idea Factory to bring the Switch version of Death Endre;Quest to our shores. They didn’t; but Limited Run Games did, and that’show I got my greedy paws on a physical version. I didn’t really know what toexpect: the game’s pitch describes it as ‘a JRPG and Visual Novel’ hybrid,which can mean pretty much anything.   The Game: Playing DErQfor two hours didn’t really enlighten me more about the way it mixes JRPG andVN elements. However, this is entirely my fault: I skipped every singlecutscene to focus on combat and exploration, and missed a ton of important datain the process — including tutorials and major explanations about the game world. Iended up being stuck as a result; and since I had little else to do, I proceededto fight and obliterate every living thing in sight.  I didn’t have to force myself at all, mind you: combat in DErQis incredibly fun and intoxicating. The fighting system is similar to the HyperdimensionNeptunia one, as each party member can move around in a fighting arena andhas a defined attack range; however, the emphasis on turn-based and strategyelements is much stronger than in HN. You can choose three actions foreach party member at the beginning of a turn; you then position your characterthe way you want, and unleash the three actions. I’ve not gone beyond chainingregular attacks during my two hours of play; but the strategic potential isobvious. Add to this a pool-like mechanic (that involves knocking back foesagainst each other or against the arena’s boundaries) and special ground tiles that can beused to trigger transformations in party members, and you get a deep, complexand engaging fighting system that begs to be mastered to the fullest.    Oh, and did I mention that levelling-up is uber-fast? You gaina level every two to four battles, depending on the number and levels of foes.By the time I hit the two-hours mark, my team of two boasted a pretty decentLv.20. — just asgood as Emboar reaching Lv.30 after three hours. I’m totally aware I wouldn’thave reached that level after a mere two hours of play if I hadn’t skipped allthe VN elements; however, it means that the grinding potential is there.    Still, that sweet grindiness doesn’t make me blind to the game’s flaws.For one, being stuck because I skipped a cutscene and some tutorials isa serious downside, and a potential deal-breaker. For another, I don’t fancythe setting and the overall atmosphere. Shina’s world feels utterly generic,the kind of game world you’ve seen in a million budget games before; and sodoes Arata’s modern day Japan, which could have been lifted from basically anyVN. Lily Hopes reminds me a lot of another RPG character, but I cannot pinpointwhich one; and positioning in combat is sometimes a real chore.   The Verdict: I love DeathEnd re;Quest’s combat; however, that alone is not enough to declare it aNew Classic. I know I bought that game from LRG, and I know that I reallywanted to get the opportunity to play the series… Still, I cannot lie tomyself, and I cannot ignore my gaming instinct’s conclusion: DErQ doesn’thave what it takes to stay in my collection. Still, not all hope is lost forthe series and for its amazing fighting system: I own the sequel, which seemsto sport a more distinctive atmosphere — and hopefully a couple of quality-of playimprovements. We’ll see how it fares in due time!"},
{"title": "3DS/2DS: Getting my act together ", "date": "23/08/2022", "text": "It’s been roughly two years since production of the Switch’s oldersister stopped for good — and when I say ‘for good’, I cannot help but mean it a bit literally. In hindsight, the 3DS tenure now feels like an absolute purge.A part of my gamer’s soul is still vomiting the system; and the Switch Liteera, all amazing games and absence of region lock, only makes my disgust morevivid. Collecting for the 3DS/2DS was an absolute hassle, whether you considergames or pieces of kit themselves. It’s not just the hateful region lock; it’salso the console’s late-life iterations, such as the New 3DS, the 2DS and theNew 2DS. I bought what feels like a million 3DS and 2DS, only to end up withthe third smallest of all my sub-collections — beatenonly by the GBA and the Game Boy.   I love the New 2DS, that much is sure. I own a couple of them, and Iwouldn’t part with them for all the money in the world; however, I now realiseall the rest has to go. And by ‘all the rest’, I mean all my European 3DS, mytwo North-American 3DS, and that Japanese 3DS I bought on a whim to play 7THDragon III — right before learning it would belocalized. Needless to say, all my Japanese and North-American games have to go as well. For one, thereare more than enough good games out there, and I don’t need to clingdesperately to every single title; for another, I really don’t own that manyNorth-American and Japanese games to begin with. See for yourselves: —     Code of Princess (NA): part of the New Classic rejects—     Moco Moco Friends (NA): same thing—     Rune Factory 4 (NA): I own the Switch version.Nuff said!—     The Alliance Alive (NA): same as above.—   Shin Megami Tensei IV (NA): didn't pass the New Classic test. —     Etrian Mystery Dungeon 2 (JP): The first entry should beenough to satiate me. Not only that, but that sequel may well pop up on theSwitch one day.  —     Lord of Magna – Maiden Heaven (NA): I said before that I wanted to keepit; but I honestly don’t want it enough to keep a dedicated 3DS just forit. —     Langrisser Re:IncarnationTensei (NA) : I don’t even really wanna playthat game to begin with — especially since I own Langrisser I&II onthe Switch. —     7th Dragon III –Code VFD (NA&JP): I own the European version,so obviously I don’t need that pair. —     Reve Unitia (JP): I don’t even know why I bought that game, honestly. An SRPG Talesspinoff? Let’s get real here, there is just no way I’ll ever play that thing.—     Dragon Quest XI (JP): There is obviously no need to keep that game now that Iown the Switch version.—     Fire Emblem Warriors (New 3DS/2DS exclusive): A game that is tied to a very specificversion of a given system is just a giant thorn in a gamer’s side. If I wannaplay Fire Emblem Warriors, I’ll just buy the Switch version, which comeswith a very gentle price tag.   I’m notdisowning these consoles and games, though; on the contrary, I’m respectfullyacknowledging their importance in my gaming career. They belong to a time whenmy collecting impulses couldn’t be fully satisfied by games and systems I lovedin earnest; I just had to redirect them somewhere, and the purchase ofNorth-American and Japanese 3DS and games was the result of that rerouting. Thefact that I’m able to discard them now means that the gaming times are better,and that my collecting impulses don’t need to roam weird avenues to befulfilled. On a side note, seeing how tiny my 3DS collection is really makes mewanna to put it to the New Classic test without delay — just imagine how goodit’ll feel to have a whole sub-collection sorted out! I’ll get to that soon,dear fellow gamers, and you’ll be the first to know about it. In the meantime,keep doing whatever makes you happy, and take care!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #8: Kitaria Fables", "date": "22/08/2022", "text": "The Backstory: A kawaiiARPG featuring an anthropomorphic cat as MC had to catch my eye; whetherthe Rune Factory-lite gameplay could captivate me was another matter. FantasyLife, a 3DS game with similar gameplay, failed to entertain me back in thedays; yet I dove into KF with an open mind — all the more so as it was published by my dearPQube.    The Game: After an hour ofplay, my main lingering impression was that Kitaria Fables could as wellhave been called Vanilla Fables. Everything is decent enough, butnothing is extraordinary. The stylised graphics are cute, but not memorable;the story is interesting, but not captivating; combat is serviceable, but notintoxicating; the physics are pleasant, but not stellar. On top of that, thegame starts quite indolently, and takes its sweet time to build things up.    More annoying is the fact that gameplay is not exactly intuitive. Ioften found myself kinda lost, just because the game dictates that certainthings must be done in a certain order. Places of interest are hard to find,even in secluded spots: I roamed the main village like an idiot for fiveminutes, searching for a specific house and finding all houses but that one. Itfelt like one of those stupidly frustrating dreams where we try to find something and fail — except that it wasa game trying to earn its way into my collection. I’ll admit it: I nearly gaveup after that first hour of play. However, something prompted me to keepplaying, and to give the game a chance — and its legit two hours to shine.  With hindsight, this was the right thing to do. That second hour ofplay allowed me to discover most of the gameplay, explore new areas, and develop a fighting technique that made combat really enjoyable. Last but notleast, it allowed me to bask more in the game’s sweet and heart-warmingatmosphere. I was all ready to give KF a spot in my precious collection;however, by the time I got down to writing that post, I had virtually forgottenthe game. Ouch.  The Verdict: KitariaFables is most definitely not a New Classic of mine. It started off bad,got a bit more palatable, and ultimately left no lasting imprint whatsoever inmy gamer’s soul. A feline MC cannot single-handedly save a game; andso, KF has to go. I really wanted to love that one, but I cannot lie tomyself."},
{"title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 3: The spree that never will be", "date": "21/08/2022", "text": "The title is explicit enough, I guess: although I really wanted to enjoya glorious, once-in-a-lifetime summer binge of XC3, that dream scenario won’tbecome reality.  I could have dealt with the dreary opening area, especially knowingthat prettier, more colourful places waited ahead. I could also have dealt withthe (infamously) bad narrative and clumsy storytelling, because cutscenes canbe skipped and I (famously) only care about the gameplay in my RPG.   One thing I cannot deal with, on the other hand, is combat — which thus becomesa deal-breaker. Automatic attacks — which are the base of the series’ fightingsystem and are used to fill up gauges giving access to harder and flashier attacks — don’t feel satisfying. They are neither fast nor aggressiveenough for my taste, and I don't get a kick out of watching them. There isn’t much missing,mind you — but that little bit of missing dynamismchanges everything as far as I’m concerned.  Xenoblade Chronicles 2 had this perfectlynailed. Automatic attacks boasted an ideal tempo andintensity, to the point where you could nearly believe they were notautomatic — because they unfolded exactly theway manually-input attacks would. Do you know where this is headed, dear fellowgamers? Do you know how I’m gonna solve that quandary? I’d rather die thanreplay XC2, but I can play something else; something thatreprises the XC2 fighting system, only on a much smaller scale. Heck, youguessed it: it’s Torna – The Golden Country — a game of reasonable sizethat doesn’t require XC2 to be played, and can be bought physical toboot. Not only can it satiate my current Xenoblade craving, but it canalso satiate any such craving I may experience in the future. Goodbye XC3 — here I come, Torna!"},
{"title": "The New Classics: Progress Report #2", "date": "10/08/2022", "text": "Hello, dear fellow gamers! The New Classic project is progressing justfine — so fine, in fact, that I should be done with theSwitch branch of my precious collection by the end of August. I didn’t darehope for such a swift pace; if I keep going like that, the entirety of mycollection could be done and dusted, New Classic style, by the end of the nextsummer.  Or maybeeven earlier, actually. My gaming instinct is becoming more honed by the game,and it takes less and less time to come up with a sharp judgement regarding agame’s destiny. The average time I play a game before knowing if I wanna getmore of it or not is now down to 15 minutes, which allows me to put severalgames in a row to the New Classics test.  Why isplaying time suddenly so important, you may ask? Two reasons: a) the faster theNew Classic project goes, the more fulfilling it feels; and b) I’m actuallyitching to play some games for good, and thus I wanna wrap up the New Classicproject as swiftly as I can. Another gamer might pull off both at once, but notsingle-minded little me: I have to select my New Classics before I can indulgein playing them for good. Somechanges are also afoot when it comes to my New Classic posts. I currently have70 of them lined up; and while I’m totally planning to publish them, I alsohave to admit that the formula is getting a bit stale by now. I need to shakethings up a bit, and I’m gonna do so by writing more synthetic posts that willcover a batch of games at once. New Classics will be covered again anyway, andrejects don’t really deserve my precious writing time to begin with — win-win!  Well, the next update will come when I’m done with my Switchcollection — bar Visual Novels, which are a bit of aspecial case.

{"title": "The New Classics #7: Sonic Mania Plus", "date": "27/07/2022", "text": "The Backstory: We’redealing with the latest 2D, side-scrolling Sonic instalment; a game thatwas nearly single-handedly developed by Sonic fan game programmerChristian Whitehead, and reaped the most raving reviews since the Megadriveentries. I think I played it at some point in late 2017 or 2018; however, Ihave nearly no memories of it. I might not have been in a Sonic mood at the time; a second try was in order, just to makesure I wasn’t missing on a potential New Classic.  The Game: I guess youcannot go wrong with Green Hill and Chemical Plant as openers; whether you canimpress or surprise is another matter entirely. I’ll admit it: I was a tad disappointed.Sure, these two zones sport new gimmicks; however, they look and feel way toomuch like their original versions — which hold no secret for me whatsoever. But thencame Studiopolis, and my interest was piqued. Then Flying Battery, one of myfavourite Sonic zones ever, with a ton of delicious new gimmicks; by thetime the superb Press Garden rolled in, I was the game’s b*tch. I confess: Icleared the entirety of SMP in twosettings, over the course of a single day. And I might have played a bit more than two hours.   This is probably the first Sonic game ever in which I loveevery single zone. Even Oil Ocean, which I loathed in Sonic 2, was acomplete delight! Granted, I made the game conveniently easier by wiselypicking up Tails; but I don’t think another character would have drasticallychanged my feelings about SMP. Playing with Sonic wouldn’t have made themix of old and new zone gimmicks less stellar, or the physics less fantastic;and playing with Knuckles wouldn’t have made the boss battles less inventiveand thrilling, or the atmosphere less captivating. Cherry on the cake, the newzones are quite complex while remaining perfectly navigable; I alwaysinstinctively knew where to go, and I didn’t get lost a single time. And thegimmicks… Look, SMP sports some of the best gimmicks in the entire series.I could write a whole raving post about these gimmicks; that’s how good andabundant they are.   The Verdict: Let’s endthe suspense right away: I fell hard for SMP. I’ve not felt thatway about a Sonic game since Sonic 3&Knuckles in the mid-90s;even the Rush games, which I love to pieces, didn’t make me feel thatmix of wonderment, delight and giddiness. The whole game had me beaming andenjoying myself; without question, Sonic Mania Plus is a New Classic ofmine. Thanks a million, Mr. Whitehead!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #6: Super Neptunia RPG", "date": "15/07/2022", "text": "The Backstory: As araving Hyperdimension Neptunia fan, I obviously had to get my paws onthat 2.5D spinoff — despite its ridiculously uninspired title. Not only does said titlesound like the name of a vanilla SNES game, but it’s also quite misleading.B*tch, all canon HN games are RPGs; if you wanna point out whatmakes SNRPG different from the rest of the crew, NeptuniaSidescrolling Galore or Super Neptunia Platformer would have beenbetter suited.   The Game: Indeed, thePlatforming is strong with this one. I have nothing against some platformaction in my RPG, as my love for Astria Ascending proves; unfortunately,SNRPG’s brand of platforming is far from being as stellar and deliciousas AA’s one. The physics are wobbly at best and unreliable at worst — and when I say‘worst’, I mean jumping. It’s unprecise as heck, with jumps being eithertoo short or too long. Not only that, but platforms have some slipperinessaround the edges that makes jumping even less reliable. I cannot count thenumber of times I fell from a platform because I landed too far on it andslipped on the other side, or because I tried to run and jump at the very edgeand slipped.   Platforming is all nice and well (or not so much in that case), buthow does the RPG part fare? Well, let’s say it’s complicated. ArtisanStudios wanted to inject some exploration by allowing players to progress leftand right, but also up and down between side-scrolling sections — think Stage 1 of Platoonon the NES. Alas, that noble intent backfires on the player; with sectionsbeing very samey and dungeon maps very unprecise, it’s all to easy to getconfused and lost. Mind you, the side-scrolling sections are obviously notmeant to be labyrinthine; they just end up feeling that way, because ofpoor level design.   Combat could have been the game’s saving grace — and let’s behonest, it was at first. Hitting the A, B, X or Y buttons at precise times totrigger one of the four party members’ regular attack was something I had neverencountered before; and it felt both nicely simple and pleasantly hypnotic.Flashier skills and better attacks were obviously on the way, and I expected anice roll with that fighting system; however, my enthusiasm died on the spotwhen the game forced me to use break attacks to get rid of an HP bag boss.Break attacks are triggered through the Break meter, which has to be filled byusing regular attacks; and it takes forever to fill it. It took me fifteenfriggin’ minutes to clear that fight; fifteen minutes of hitting a foe thathealed every turn to fill my Break meter, being hit by attacks that dealt 3-4points of damage, healing when my HP got too low, and finally releasing a BreakAttack after what felt like a million hits. Zero challenge, total boredom. Thisis the complete antithesis of canon HN combat — all flashy skills, endlesscombos and fast-paced battles.    The Verdict: We allknow where this is headed, dear fellow gamers: Super Neptunia RPG is byno means a New Classic of mine. It lacks everything I love in canon HNentries; and the things it brings are definitely not to my liking. Next please!"},

Things happenjust as planned! Well, that was easy enough, ain’t it? Taking the piss out ofmyself aside, this is the best — and probably only — way I can commit to a course of action. And so,here are my Summer 2022 Gaming Plans for your enjoyment — and mine!   July:  —     Start publishing some NewClassics posts. I have roughly 40 of them lined up, and it’s time to deliverthem to the world! I'm gonna roll with a pace of 2-3 posts a week, and we'll see how things evolve from there.  —     Put together some sharedfeatures with fellow bloggers, starting with my dear Yvonne ^^ —     Answer comments! Gosh, I’m solate it’s not even funny :/ —     Fix errorsin my World End Syndrom walkthrough — and replaythe game while I’m at it. If there ever was a VN that was meant to be read inthe summer, it’s definitely WES!   August: —     Play Xenoblade Chronicles 3.I know, I know; how can I ever think of playing that game after my tumultous love/hate relationship with XC2? The thing is, I love the Xenoblade combat and atmosphere. What I’m gonna do is play XC3 in easy mode — and play it asingle time. No perennity or replaying pretence here; this is the type of sprawling gamethat is meant to be played once (and for all), and that’s exactly how I’m gonnaplay it. —     Tackle Pokemon X&Y soloruns starring Clauncher and Carbink. I’ve been itching to run with these twofor years, and I’m gonna get down to it.  September:  —     Startgetting rid of the games that didn’t get a spot in my precious collection. Thepawn shop is the easy way out; but I’m also seriously thinking of giving away thebest ones through that blog. I’ll see how I proceed when September comes; inthe meantime, dear fellow gamers, don’t hesitate to put an option on any gameyou’d like to get! ^^ —     Take the firststeps to make That Extra Level! its own website. I mean it. FOR REAL.Well, that’s all for now! I’ll make sure all of this is done — and I’ll keep makingsuch quarter plans from now on. It’s both relaxing and stimulating — and it gets things done!

The good news is that time flies so fast because I’mcurrently busy living my very best life; and the even better news is that I’mreaching a still excellent yet quieter phase, where I should be able to playand post more. Hooray!  While I was away living my best life, amazing things happened in the gamingrealm. I obviously have to talk about the upcoming Pokemon pair,whose existence I couldn’t believe at first. The games’ names may be a bituninspired, but the starters… Man, I just luv ’em!!! The very first thing I’lldo when I get my paws on the pair is play a solo run with Sprigatito, which isjust the dinkiest little kitty this side of Skitty. Knowing GameFreak, they’llprobably slap a bipedal evolution on the thing — and recent leaks seem to confirm that shittyscenario; however, I don’t care. I’m already overjoyed at the existence of thatcute creature, and it will give me a perfect excuse to attempt a challenge runstarring Sprigatito and/or whatever his middle stage evolution will be. Andmind you, Fuecoco and Quaxly look pretty neat as well, and I’ll sure run solowith them as soon as I’m done with the Grass kitty cat. To stay in the Pokemon realm, my estival X&Y itch isback; I just have to select my lone ranger, and I’m good to go. Feel free to suggestideas in the comments, dear fellow gamers! I might also play some HyperdimensionNeptunia as part of the New Classic project, as I love playing this seriesin the summertime. I polished off the three canon games already (reports here and there); however, a ton of spin-offs are waiting for the opportunity toshine, and I’ll be more than happy to indulge them.  And how about the New Classics project, you may ask? Well, it’s goingjust fine. I have many posts lined up for publication, and they’ll all appear onmy blog before the end of the summer.

The New Classics project is progressingjust fine — althoughyou wouldn’t know it, because I cannot seem to post regularly enough; and Icannot seem to do that because I can’t handle time management even if my lifedepended on it. But the runs are there, and so are the reports; and once Imanage to sort things out a bit, you’ll get these sweet reports.  I’ve put roughly 30 games to the New Classics test so far; and notonly was it tremendously entertaining, but it also helped me figure out what Iwant my precious collection to look like. As I was busy playing — and lapping up — a game I’ll postabout soon enough, I realised something important: I love grinding. Like,I really, really love it. More like I absolutely adore it, hotdamn!  Well, ain’t that old news, you might ask? It sure is; but the thing is,I might have lost sight of that important fact over the years. I might haveforsaken that engrossing trance, that tantalizing never-ending mountain toclimb, that sweetest of the sweet activity that gave this blog its very name,in favour of other gameplay styles. I did that for curiosity’s sake, and it wasa blast; but after ten years of non-stop gaming, my curiosity is quitefulfilled, and it’s time to go back to the basics and concentrate on what Ilove most. Namely, good old grinding.  This led me to a most ominous decision: all SRPGs will vacate thepremises, without being put to the New Classics test. It’s time to admit thatsuch RPGs are just not for me, and that I’ll just never enjoy strategizing asmuch as freedom & grinding. The only SRPGs I’ll hold onto are Fire EmblemEchoes, because it’s short and I love the hack’n’slash sections too darn much;and Sting’s Yggdra Union and Gungnir — because Dept. Heaven, b*tch. I will amend TheList soon enough; but the decision is taken, and it’s taken for good. No FOMO tobe found; I’m actually relieved, and glad I went back to my RPG roots.  Another important decision I’m going to enforce is to batch-test RPGseries. The very fact that I do own full series I have yet to try at allis absolutely ridiculous; I should have bought a single entry, played it, and purchasedthe rest only if I liked that first entry. Well, what’s done is done; and sinceI own these series, I might as well give them a try. Here’s how I’m gonna roll:I’ll try the very first and the very last entry of each still unplayed series Iown. If I like any of them or both, I’ll give everything in the middle a quicktry to determine what I keep; if I like none, I’ll pawn the whole thing. Lastbut not least, I’ll write a single report for the whole series once I’m done givingit the New Classics treatment. That’s all for now, dear fellow gamers; I’ll see you soon with allsorts of gaming goodness! In the meantime, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Game & Watch: The Legend of Zelda", "date": "21/04/2022", "text": "Let’s start with a disclaimer: I own Link’s Awakening DX, and I have no interest in playing the Nes Zelda entries. So why did I purchasethat Game & Watch, you may ask? First, I owned a couple of G&W as akid, and I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to get my paws on such anostalgic item. Secondly, and most importantly, I never quite liked LADX, and always considered the originalto be the superior version. As far as I’m concerned, not only does colour bringnothing at all to the game, but it actually detracts from its charm and magic.I find the pure, clear, kinda liquid monochromatic graphics of theoriginal ten times more evocative and attractive than the garishly recolouredgraphics of the remake. Back when I purchased my GBA, I tried to secure theoriginal for a decent price and failed, and made do with DX; but deep in my heart, I always regretted not possessing theversion I grew up with. I now have it secured on its own nostalgia-inducingdedicated handheld, and I couldn’t be happier.   I was genuinely surprised by how tinythat piece of kit turned out to be; obviously, it was bigger in my childhoodmemories — and hands.But it wasn’t long before I completely forgot that detail and lost myself inthe game, playing with abandon and polishing no less than three back-to-backruns. I had nearly forgotten how much I love that game, and how goodit feels to be able to dive straight into gameplay and get a lot done in ashort time. LA’s gameplay feels tight and compact, and displays some densityand purposefulness I was missing without realizing it.   I was tempted to chalk this up to the gameplay style of the 90’s,before I remembered that games of that era were choke-full with fake longevityand that I spent a considerable amount of time being utterly stranded during myfirst run of LA (I was so stuck and desperate at some point that I triedhitting all the walls with my sword in the hope of discovering a hidden room withsomething that could help me progress — heck, I even tried to get rid of the beachmonkey in the hope of triggering a miracle, to no avail obviously.) Instead,these pleasant qualities of the gameplay come from the fact that I know thegame like the back of my hand after playing it a million times. This bodes verywell for the future of my gaming career: once I’m done finding my Cult Classics,I can replay them again and again and get that same feeling of sharp, condensed,razor-like mastery.   I don’t have much to add about LA, since I already wrote aboutit here and there; but since I was at it, I gave the original NES Zeldaa try. And, well… Maybe I’m missing something here, but I totally failed to seethe appeal. I crossed many monster-infested screens, trying to find a dungeon;but the only thing I found were three shops I couldn’t do business with, wobblyhitboxes by the truckload, and a general feeling of wasting my time. It didn’thelp that this opening entry stands beyond my own Retro Tolerance Horizon (a concept I’llexpand on later): to put it simply, it’s too barren, too graphically primitive,too ‘where-do-I-go-next’ and generally too ancient to appeal to me. Thatdoesn’t matter, though. Loving the original Zelda would have been theicing on the cake; but the cake was always LA, and it remains utterlydelicious — and Idon’t fancy icing that much anyway. I’ll see you soon with more gaminggoodness, dear fellow gamers; until then, take care and keep gaming!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #5: Cogen: Sword of Rewind", "date": "11/04/2022", "text": "The Backstory:Platformers are not my cup of tea; yet I canenjoy them under the right circumstances, as my undying love for 2D Sonic games proves. Cogen’s gimmick ofrewinding time after death seemed like a dream come true, a player-friendlyinterpretation of die-and-retry that could make level navigation easier andless stressful. I just had to try Cogen,and I did so by downloading the conveniently available demo on the NintendoeShop.  The Game: Not gonna lie:the dark and empty levels were a harsh let-down. I wanted these gorgeouscrystalline blues, whites and greys featured on the cover art, darn it! Fromwhat I’ve understood, the first levels are tutorials of sorts; and an internetsearch revealed that more detailed environments appear later. Yet, I’ve notencountered a single picture featuring the colours and feel of the official art; instead, everything seems to be on thedark and gloomy side — both in terms of colours and general atmosphere. Have you heard offalse advertising, Gemdrops?   Let’s forget about the graphics, and focus on what brought me there:the gameplay, folks. Once again, not gonna lie: the Rewind gimmick rocks. Here’s how it works: death isinstant in Cogen, as there is nohealth bar. Once you die, the screen freezes, and you’re given the possibilityto assess your situation and rewind the action up to three seconds. This isperfect in the context of a tough Platformer — which Cogenis — because itallows you to relax and rush through levels instead of trembling at every step.In fact, cautious progression is not advised in Cogen; from what I’ve played, going fast and reacting on the flyworks much better than treading ground carefully.  Now, I have a serious issue with Cogen’sphysics. They are really good; however, they’re not perfect. Jumping in particular can be tricky, especially when wallsare involved; and I could never shake that nagging feeling of not being fullyin control of the MC — which means that Cogen’sphysics require some getting-used-to. A talented Platformer aficionado couldcertainly handle these physics without breaking a sweat; however, a reluctantPlatformer player with crappy motor skills such as me needs highly reliable and easy-to-master physics.     Last but not least: as much as it embarrasses me to admit it, Cogen remains too hard for me. Save points are too few andfar between, and the levels’ demands in terms of reaction speed are simply toochallenging. Even the Rewind gimmick cannot save me from my lack of motorskills misery; what I would really need is save states — or an easier game.   The Verdict: Cogen lacks the things I need to enjoy aPlatformer — perfectphysics, a pleasant atmosphere, and a reasonable difficulty level. But mostimportantly, playing it doesn’t feel good. Sure, it kinda gripped me in withits constant challenge, and I enjoyed the couple of times I managed to executea perfect series of moves and progress fluidly; but once I turned off mySwitch, I was left with a feeling of frustration, restlessness and emptiness. This is the most telltale sign thatCogen and I are not meant together; and so, I’ll quietly erase the demo andmove on to the next potential cult classic. Too bad, so sad!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #4: Solatorobo: Red the Hunter", "date": "03/04/2022", "text": "The Backstory: We’retalking about a game featuring anthropomorphic cats and dogs, which alreadymakes me very partial towards Solatorobo. Despite generating laudingreviews, Sky & Robots — the title’s literal translation — is not exactly well known. It might be becauseit came at the very end of the DS’ tenure, in 2010/2011; it might also bebecause it belongs to a confidential series. Also, funny and unrelatedanecdote: I remember standing in the custom office, while the parcel containingthe game was opened by a custom officer to determine how much I would have tofork out in custom fees. Aaah, unsweet memories.   The Game: Solatoroboboasts one of the best introductions I’ve played in a long time. That inmedias res sequence manages to mix intriguing narrative elements,fulfilling gameplay sequences and shorts yet explicit tutorials — and to firmlyplant the atmosphere to boot. After going through that intro, you just wantto play the game, and to discover that gorgeous world you got a glimpse of.  Said gorgeous world only gets more fleshed out as you enter the gameper se. It’s a very vivid and vibrant universe that leaves a deep impressionright away — to thepoint where I’m honestly surprised no anime series was ever derived from Solatorobo.And obviously, I had to love the French interjections that pepper thedialogue scenes. Ooh là la, Sapristi, Etvoilà, voyons, Nom d’un chien — MOAR! The latter, “nom d’un chien” is deliciouslyfitting: it could be translated as “for pete’s sake”, but it literally means“in the name of a dog”, which is just perfect given that Red is, well, a dog.   But enough about the game world and its undeniable potency, animepotential and delicious frenchness; let’s talk gameplay, folks! Solatorobooperates on a mission system, which makes it the perfect game for short burstsof play. Story segments unfold between each mission, which seems to indicatethat the game is gonna be heavy on narrative; but since the game world is socaptivating, I really don’t mind. Plus, these story segments are told throughfixed screens in which you progress through the dialogues with the A button,which I find more involving and less frustrating than animated cutscenes you haveto sit through.  As for more technical aspects of the gameplay, we’re dealing with anaction-adventure game with light RPG elements. The real-time combat system isdeliciously intuitive and easy to grasp; the physics, while not outstanding,are perfectly serviceable. The only real issue I spotted is the fact thatperforming diagonal movement with the DS’ D-pad is kinda tricky; however, aquick try of the game on my 3DS revealed that the analog stick could neatlysolve that issue. This is a game I’ll definitely play on the 3DS when I replayit. Oops, did I say too much already?  The Verdict: Let’s endthe suspense already: Solatorobo is indeed a New Classic of mine — so much so that Iactually wanted to keep playing. There is something refreshing andheart-warming in that game, something that harkens back to simpler gamingtimes. It’s also a game that feels very DS: it boasts that distinctive mix of simplicity,enthusiasm and freshness that shines in most DS games and came to define the DSera; and I genuinely couldn’t imagine it on any other system, nor would I wantit remade. Solatorobo is perfect the way it is; and although I’m takingFrench leave for now, I’ll go back to it without fail. Je reviendrai, c’estpromis!"},
{"title": "Kirby’s Dream Land: Warm and fluffy", "date": "26/03/2022", "text": "I’m in the mood for shorter playing spells now, which squaresperfectly with the New Classics project. However, I have to admit that I kindamiss the feeling of completion; andno matter how you slice it, playing the early stages of a game for two hoursjust cannot provide that feeling. Andso, I turned to some oldies goldies to get myself some of that sweet fulfilmentonly the rolling of credits can provide. First in line is Kirby’s Dream Land, the original Game Boy entry and kickstarter ofthe whole series. I chose the pastel colour palette on my GBA to honour Kirby’soriginal Japanese design, and I dove into that cult classic of my teenage yearswith gusto. I hadn’t played KDL for aserious number of years; yet it was just as heart-warming, mellow and pleasantas in my memories. It was easy back in the days, when I spent a whole springplaying it in a loop at the tender age of fourteen; and it only got easier as26 years and dozens of games went by. Yet sometimes, easy is just what you need; you may even need easy and short, which is exactly what KDL provides. In its basic form, anyway; there is still theso-called ‘Extra Game’, which can be accessed by pressing Down, A and Start onthe title screen after finishing the game once. It’s a less forgiving versionof KDL sporting extra foes withtrickier attack patterns, harder bosses and more traps; I tried it, and got mybutt severely kicked in the first level. I’ll probably tackle that mode one day— but nottoday. Not in the mood for challenge, baby!   Fun fact, by the way: back in the days, I never managed to launch theExtra game. I didn’t understand you had to perform the button combination on the title screen, upon starting a newrun. I always did it on the screen that informs you of said button combination;and obviously, nothing happened. Ah, to be older and wiser! Another thing Idiscovered by complete happenstance is the configuration mode, whichcan be accessed by pressing Down, A and Selecton the title screen. That mode allows you to tinker with Kirby’s HP bar andnumber of lives, and to listen to the game’s soundtrack through a sound test. Asound test… Gosh, this is so ’90s it hurts.    Another thing that is very ‘90s is the scoring obsession. I hadforgotten how important score was inthat era; the legacy of the arcade was still alive and well in the consoleworld, and every single Platformer sported a dedicated ‘score’ line in theplayer interface, somewhere between the HP bar and the stage count. (I’mspeaking figuratively here: in terms of actual position, the score line usuallystood proudly on the top of the interface.) Every single action inflated yourscore: disposing of foes, picking up items, destroying breakables, polishing ofa level in record time, you name it — and you reaped those sweet points. KDL sticks to that trope to a T, and Iremember very well going out of my way to gobble every single foe and hinderingblock and collect every item back in the days. However, now that the scoringobsession has deserted both games and gamers’ collective psyche, that way ofplaying is losing its appeal. Most of the foes in KDL can be avoided, most of the items can be ignored, and mostblock can be left intact; it’s nearly like the level design was created as anincentive to high scoring rather than as a challenge.   Other things didn’t age gracefully in KDL. The power-ups are laughingly useless, and the boss rush iskinda pointless: the game is so short and easy that fighting all bosses againright before the final showdown delivers no sense of increased power andmastery — not tomention that you’ll probably be done beating these bosses a couple of minutesago already. And talking about the final showdown, it’s a bit of a let-down aswell. King Dedede could as well have been called ‘King RNG’; depending on howhis attack patterns unfold, the fight can be over swiftly or drag on endlessly.It’s more a matter of luck than skill, and it’s boring. To this day, I still don’t manage to manipulate Dedede’sbehaviour reliably enough to make consistent use of the ‘hammer strike’ stars;if somebody knows a trick, I’d be more than glad to learn it. That final fight’sonly saving grace is the kickass music, which is simply one of the most epicboss battle themes I’ve encountered in my gaming career.    All in all, I still love that game despite its flaws. I dig therazor-sharp, perfectly reliable physics; I love the splendid graphics andsoundtrack that make the most of the Game Boy’s capacities; and last but notleast, I adore the lovely atmosphere and the comfortable easiness. KDL is one of a precious few PlatformersI enjoy and can replay without ever getting bored, and I’ll keep cherishing it — needless to say,this is a Cult Classic of mine. I’llsee you soon with more gaming goodness, new or old; take care, dear fellowgamers!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #3: Blue Reflection: Second Light", "date": "21/03/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Back in2017, Koei Tecmo’s decision to leave the Vita version of Blue Reflectionin Japan left me seriously salty. I purchased a Japanese copy that got lost inthe mail, which I took as a sign that BR and I were not meant together. So,imagine my joy and surprise upon discovering that the Switch sequel would graceour shores! I can at long last get myself some Blue Reflection,after five long years spent pining for the original. Good things come to thosewho wait, indeed!  The Game: You know I’m atotal sucker for atmosphere in games, especially when said atmospherehappens to be dreamlike; and boy oh boy, does BRSL has dreamy atmospherein spades. The crystalline colours, the delicate character design and theethereal soundtrack went straight to my gamer’s heart and bore a serious holethere — heck, abit of my soul is still lingering in the game.    Do you know what else went straight to my gamer’s heart? The skippablecutscenes. (Insert eyes teary with happiness.) Not to say that the story doesn’tsound interesting, because it actually does; but it’s such a relief to knowthat I can dispense with it and focus on exploration and combat if I fancy it.Now of course, this is exactly what I did during my two-hour session: the storycould wait, but the gameplay couldn’t. Speaking of which…  Side quests, relationship building, farming and crafting, exploration:BRSL boasts all the trappings of a decent RPG. But that alone wouldn’thave been enough to make me fall in love with that game: the key point was combat.It took me a while to wrap my head around the fighting system, because itdoesn’t really play like anything else I’m familiar with — and the milliontutorials left me more confused than enlightened. In a nutshell: it’s an ATBsystem that gives you a button prompt when a character can act; upon hittingsaid button, time is suspended while you choose your action. As far as I’mconcerned, this is totally the best of two worlds, as it mixes the thrill of real-timecombat and the deliberation of turn-based combat. Even better: since actionitself is suspended when you nail a button prompt, this means that you oftenend up with the whole team doing their thing at once, making for a glorious andexhilarating flurry of on-screen activity.   As far as battle systems are concerned, tweakable difficulty level isa must, and sweeping camera moves are a plus; and wouldn’t you know, BRSL’sbattle system has both. What a fighting system doesn’t really need are transformations;but gosh, is it lovely to have them! From Mega-Evolution in Pokemonto Hard Drive Divinity in Hyperdimension Neptunia, in-combatmetamorphoses never fail to delight me. BRSL’s brand of magical girl-ismis made even better by the fact that you don’t trigger it yourself; it happensupon fulfilling certain conditions, which makes it both a surprise and areward. (No, I absolutely didn’t squeal in delight when I witnessed my veryfirst transformation.) And then you have wonderful details, such asthe fact that Rena’s skills have French names and Ao’s skills haveIcelandic/Old Norse names; being a French-born gamer who dwelt many years in Iceland, this was bound to please me.   The Verdict: BlueReflection: Second Light gives meplenty of feels already. Add to this the (still untouched) story and therelationship building, which many reviewers describe as the game’s best assets,and you totally have a game with cult classic potential. No surprise there, thatunhoped-for sequel is totally here to stay!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #2: Pokemon Legends: Arceus", "date": "15/03/2022", "text": "The Backstory: Thelatest Pokemon offering, which I obviously had to buy uponrelease. Although it was presented as a tie-in game and a prequel to the BD&SPpair, I can very well envision PLA kickstarting its own spinoff seriesif it turns out to be a success. Now, was it a success in yours truly’s eyes?Let’s find out!   The Game: Let’s cut to thechase here: PLA is basically an offline MMORPG with a Pokemontheme. It boasts all the trappings of the genre: the mission-based progression,the wide areas, the quest markers, the farming & crafting, the Fedex and20-bear-asses quests, and probably others I couldn’t find out during my twohours of play.   Most importantly, this is a game that revolves around hardcorecompletion. Although completion has always been a running theme in the series,it’s been taken to the extreme in PLA. Capturing all the Hisui ‘Mons is presentedright away as the game’s ultimate goal; but the completion galore doesn’t stopthere, oh no precious. See the screenshot above? It features the kind of missionsyou’ll have to tackle to fill up a ‘Mon’s Pokedex entry. I have nothing to addhere; anybody can figure out the bottomless grinding that will ensue, and howmuch of a time sinker PLA can be. Now, will it be a time sinker for me?  The Verdict: Let’s getreal here, dear fellow gamers. This is a very nice game, and I must admit Ijust love Hisui’s gorgeous vistas… However, I’m a Pokemon solorunner. I don’t want to capture the entirety of hisui’s fauna, I don’twant to catch the same ‘Mon 30 times in a row, I don’t want to battle‘Mons over and over to witness a random Move, and I don’t want toperform any other crazy completion feat FLA has in store. This game ishilariously, painfully, definitely not for me. I’m sure it will rekindlethe Pokemon flame for many a gamer; but it will become neither a Pokemonfavourite nor a cult classic of mine. Thank you, next!"},
{"title": "Crossing the 500 posts mark! ", "date": "10/03/2022", "text": "Hullo, dear fellow gamers! I think the title is prettyself-explanatory: I published 503 posts on That Extra Level! — counting this one.I wasn’t planning to write a celebratory post about this milestone at first; ThatExtra Level! will be ten years old in 2023, and I wanted to wait untilthat milestone. But then I thought that: a) I don’t know if I’ll stillbe blogging in 2023, or even if I’ll still be there; and b) I want toreminisce and look back on my blogging and gaming journey right now, asI’m entering a brand new, fresh and shiny phase of my gaming career.     Like 99% of blogs of that era, TEL! was born out of impulse inlate 2013. I was playing Avalon Code at the time, and loving it so muchthat I just needed to share the love; incidentally, I was also living ina matchbox appartment to save money, and I just needed some escapism. These twoneeds combined, and voilà! That Extra Level! was born.  Not only has TEL! become inextricably tied to my gamingactivity, but it also mirrors the evolution of my gaming career over the pasteight years. The early days were a flurry of giddiness and enthusiasm: I wasdiving back into gaming, and there was no shortage of post ideas and featureconcepts. I used to play RPGs extensively at the time, leaving no stoneunturned and no extra boss alive; and my posts were massive walls of text, inwhich I tried to tell everything about a game — from its developer to the effect it had on me,without forgetting that minute detail that struck my fancy. I honestly cannotre-read posts from that era: they are too enormous, even for me.     Then came the middle days — a.k.a. ‘The Honeymoon is over’. There were recurrentschedule issues, and gaming was losing its freshness and becomingbusiness-as-usual; and my blogging reflected that. I officially declared TEL!was over at some point, before coming back some days later with second thoughtsand the will to work things out. Following that low(est) point, I trieddifferent blogging avenues to jazz things up. I started writing about mycollecting, backup systems and special editions; I launched new featuresthat didn’t stick, such as ‘Bits and Tidbits’ and ‘Play in progress’; and Igenerally tried my best to stay afloat, waiting for the storm to pass and formy gaming & blogging mojo to come back.  It did come back all right; and that comeback launched the late(st) era ofboth TEL! and my gaming career, a.k.a. ‘The Glory Days’. I realised thatplaying games only brought me happiness, and that I should really make it afixture in my life and proudly claim my love for all things gaming.Coincidentally, I reached a new level of mastery in my blogging: I found my ownstyle and cemented it, and I became able to commit my feelings about a game topaper faster and more smoothly than ever before. I have no reason to stopgaming nor blogging now; both feel totally natural and effortless — not to mention deliciouslyfulfilling.    A new phase is opening right now, as I’m tackling the New Classics project. Switching between games at such a fast pace is incredibly refreshing,stimulating and entertaining; allotting two hours maximum to each game promptsme to get straight to the crux of the matter and to sort out my feelings rightaway. As a result, my posts also are getting shorter, sharper and more condensed— and givenhow verbose I tend to be, this is totally a blessing.  Long story short, I’m on a roll right now. My next major move may be togive TEL! its very own URL and domain name; it’s been on air so longthat I think it deserves it — and so do I. At any rate, I’m incredibly happy of what I accomplishedalready; there were highs and lows, but that blogging journey was incredibly funas a whole — and stillis. It’s not over yet, oh no precious; there is much, much more to come! Thankyou for following my modest blog all these years, dear fellow gamers; hopefullywe’ll keep cruising together! Take care, and see you soon with plenty of gaminggoodness!"},
{"title": "The New Classics #1: Astria Ascending", "date": "07/03/2022", "text": "The Backstory: AstriaAscending is one of my most recent acquisitions, being claimed by my gaminginstinct upon release. Everything drew me to it, from the splendid cover art tothe evocative title; and learning that it was the result of the unlikely meetingof a virtually unknown French developer and two Final Fantasy luminariesonly fuelled my interest.    The Game: AA couldas well stand for ‘Amazing Atmosphere’. It’s been a long time since Iencountered a game with such a vibrant and mesmerizing aura, and I wasinstantly sucked in. The vibrant colours, the gorgeous soundtrack and thesplendid graphics and character sprites all combine to create a superbambience; and then you have the story, which is told in the most clever andefficient way you could imagine. The game starts with a cinematic intro thatpresents the game world’s captivating and poignant lore — in a very elegantand poetic way to boot. From then on, story progression is handled throughshort and sweet bits of dialogue, and characters’ personalities are fleshedthrough their postures, animations, battle interjections and lines in theaforementioned bits of dialogue. Let me tell you: AA’s atmospheremanages to captivate and enthral me just as much as Xenoblade Chronicles 2’s— with aglorious economy of means compared to the latter.    Atmosphere is all well and nice; but what about the gameplay? Well, I’mglad to say it’s stellar as well. My breath hitched when I discovered theexistence of 2D platforming sections, which could easily have ruined the wholeexperience for me; however, my apprehension quickly turned to utter giddiness. AA’splatforming is actually some of the best platforming I’ve handled in mywhole life. The physics are out of this world, smooth and precise andtotally delightful — I swear, I’d be the most hardcore Platformer aficionado of them allif all Platformers boasted such physics. Combat didn’t totally convince me atfirst, because battles were a tad too hard and slow for my taste; however, I neatlysolved those issues by tweaking the battle speed and difficulty level, and Ijust couldn’t get enough of fighting after that.   AA also scratchesanother itch I didn’t expect it to scratch at all. See, the game in general,and battle screens in particular, totally looks like one of these browser gamesI’ve been dying to try for years — Granblue Fantasy and the like. The crewboasts the typical stylishness of browser game characters — only without thegacha element, and with automatic levelling-up for characters that don’t takepart in battle. That’s totally the better of two worlds, methinks; and AAwill totally become my very own offline browser game.   The Verdict: This gameis an absolute work of love, and that love shines through in the mostmoving and enchanting way. Total and utter Cult Classic potential here!"},
{"title": "Tales of the Abyss: See you, so long, goodbye, hooray", "date": "23/02/2022", "text": "Tales of the Abyss: a namethat, even years after the facts, rouses powerful emotions in my gamer’s heart.Not only was it my first Tales game, but it was also my first JRPG — in the modernsense of the word. Make yourself comfortable and bring out the popcorn, dearfellow gamers: for this is the story of my tempestuous relationship with a gameI’ll gladly part with now. I played TotA during the summer 2013, a couple of months beforelaunching That Extra Level!. That was roughly nine years ago; and yet, Iremember everything with vivid clarity. The red vintage armchair in which Ilounged while playing, the TV shows I listened to on my computer sitting on thecoffee table next to me, the summer light filtering through the blinds, thewhole atmosphere and feel of the 35 hours I spent on TotA.  One word perfectly sums up my experience with that game: obsession.My feelings for TotA were beyond such trivial things as love and hate — although I didfeel both in turns. I felt compelled to play it by a force greater than my gaminginstinct; it fascinated me and revulsed me all at once, and yet I couldn’tstop. I cannot think of another game that awoke such powerful and conflictingfeelings in my gamer’s heart — and I’m glad there is no other, honestly. Why did TotA make such an impact? I could try to pinpoint anumber of reasons. First, this was my first encounter with an RPG in which thenarrative and the characters were so paramount — i.e. a modern JRPG. I’ll be honest: I don’t evenlike the cast of TotA, and yet they wormed their way into my mind andstayed with me weeks after I finished the game. I was not readyfor this: I came from a place where heroes were mute lone rangers and gameplayreigned supreme. But the TotA crew… Man, they were not mere RPGcharacters; they were friggin’ anime characters. Their woes and innerconflicts were all over the place, and you couldn’t escape them even if youwanted to. (SPOILERS!) Luke behaving like a spoilt kid to hide his destroyedpsyche, Tear displaying some maturity beyond her years yet being a sensitiveand shy young woman at heart, Guy concealing his murderous intents behindover-the-top optimism and cheerfulness and warming up to Luke in earnest, Jadebeing cool and caustic yet genuinely caring about his younger charges, Nataliabeing deeply dependable and duty-oriented despite her petulancy… (End ofSPOILERS) Gosh, I still remember all this, and I don’t even want to! And then you had the gameplay. Look, I’ll bare my heart here: TotAis one of my worst RPG gameplay experiences. My memories are kinda hazy; but I stillremember dark labyrinthine dungeons full of tedious puzzles, a stealth missionin a defile that sucked dry my will to live and nearly made me (rage)quit, aridiculously convoluted fighting system whose full mastery always seemed toelude me, a lot of backtracking, interminable trips between locations, and ageneral feeling of not enjoying myself. And yet, I couldn’t drop that darn game:as tedious as its gameplay was, it was also new and fresh, something I hadnever experienced before. Not only that, but I was still in the early stages ofmy Second Coming of Gaming: you could have thrown the worst RPG ever at me, andI’d probably have lapped it up anyway. Oh, and let’s not forget that I wascoming out of literal years of videogame deprivation, and that dropping a game wassimply unthinkable at the time.  Why, I didn't remember decking up my team in bathing suits. Naughty, naughty me! ♠And there you have it, dear fellow gamers: my own private Tales ofthe Abyss story. I don’t think I’ll ever quite understand why I played thatgame to the bitter end, or fully grasp the depth and complexity of my feelingstowards it. But I know one thing for sure: I don’t ever wanna play itagain, and to the pawn shop it’s headed! Somehow, I feel better after writingthis; I guess I needed to spill my guts about TotA, once and for all.I’ll see you soon with more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers; in themeantime, take care and have fun!"},
{"title": "The New Classics: The Contenders, a.k.a. The List", "date": "15/02/2022", "text": "AfterI’ve revealed the rejects, it’s time to list the games that will be put to theNew Classics test! Not only will this list refresh my memory and give me a goodoverview of the job, but it will also allow for an interesting bit of gaminginteraction. Here’s the plan, dear fellow gamers: should you spot in my list agame you’re curious about, just let me know and I’ll play it. This should spicethings up, and make the whole endeavour stimulating for all of us. ^^Here's a quick recap of the New Classics modus operandi: I play each game for two hours at most. Based on the fact that my favourite games have always been games I loved immediately, this should allow me to separate the wheat from the chaff with great efficiency. (For the interested, the full description of the New Classics project can be read here.)Before Imove on to the list, here are a couple of points I wanna mention:  — VNs andpuzzle games won’t be a priority during the New Classics phase, because oftheir inherent low replay value. As a result, they won't be listed here. — The fewJapanese games I own will be kept aside for now; I’ll get to them once I’m donewith the Westerners. — Digitalgames won’t be listed. Not only is most of my remaining digital library made ofKemco games, which I love as a rule, but digital games cannot be pawned anyway.So I might as well keep them, and play them if/when I feel like it. — I’lllink the games’ names to their respective post as I progress; so this list canbe used as an entry point into the upcoming jungle of New Classics reviews. — In casesimilar versions of a game exist on more than one system, I’ll only list theversion I own (or plan to play in case I own several). Like, Atelier Firisis available on both the Vita and the Switch; but I own the Switch version, so thisis the one I’ll roll with. On the other hand, if we’re dealing with remakes ordifferent versions, I’ll list all the versions and try them all. — Lastbut not least, I’ll keep the games sorted by alphabetical order and by series;and if a game’s name starts with “the”, I’ll ignore that and take the followingword into account.

I encountered gamesI didn’t even remember owning, while other instantly brought in a mass of sweetmemories and a strong desire to play them. I’ll play them all no matter what,don’t worry; but this goes to show that my collection formed in a prettyhaphazard way over the years. Some entries were highly anticipated, whileothers were merely the result of me desperately wanting to buy something — anything. I’m also quite surprised that I ended uppurchasing full series — spinoffs et al. — before even trying a single instalment to see ifit was my thing — case in point, Kingdom Hearts (which I have yet to play) and FinalFantasy (which I dislike overall). This was the result of my immense greedand lust for games, and I can vaguely remember that it made perfect senseat the time; but it is not something I could see myself doing nowadays — case in point, theYokai Watch Averted Binge. Well, live and play and learn — and pass it on ifit doesn’t tickle your gaming fancy.  But what about the Switch games that will be released in 2022 andbeyond, you may ask? Yeah, about that… I may claim that I won’t get my greedypaws on a single new game until I’m done with the New Classic phase; but such aclaim would be hilariously unrealistic, and we all know it. Knowing that everynew game will have to pass the New Classic test to remain in my collectionanyway, here’s what I’ve decided: I’ll buy all the games my gaming instinctclaims, and add them to the list on the fly. Just in case you’re wondering, theList (with capital L from now on) currently comprises 404 games — a super-stylishnumber, but one that probably won’t stay put for long.  For the posts themselves, I’m going to use a fixed layout, with nointro or outro. Each post will comprise three parts:  The Backstory, where I’ll present     how I got the game as well as any interesting trivia about it;The Game, where I’ll expand on my     impressions of, well, the game;The Verdict, where I’ll reveal if     the game is granted a spot in my precious collection. That’s pretty much all, dear fellow gamers. We’re in for a thrillingride for sure, and I hope you’ll enjoy it as much as me! And remember: if a game featured on The List tickles your fancy, just let me know and I'll play it ^^."},
{"title": "The New Classics: The Rejects", "date": "12/02/2022", "text": "The grandest overhaul of them all has started, dear fellow gamers!First thing first, here’s an exhaustive list of the already played gamesthat will soon exit my precious collection, conveniently sorted out by system.  Game Boy / GBA:— Tetris:Even though I made my peace with it, Tetris isn’t, and will never be, a cultclassic of mine. — Pokemon Blue & Pokemon Yellow: Now that I own FireRed, LeafGreen and Let’sGo Pikachu&Eevee, I have absolutely no reason to hold onto these games. — Tales of Phantasia: It wasn’t bad at all, but it’s certainly not a cult classic ofmine. Heck, I had to restart it twice, and I have yet to finish it — that saysit all, doesn’t it? — Golden Sun: It was lovely, and it brought me some retro goodness I really craved at the time; however, it failed to leave a lasting imprint in my gamer's soul. I’m still holding onto the two sequels for now, though; we’ll seeif they’re more memorable.— Swordof Mana: The only reason I might want to play that game again is the SeikenDensetsu signature graphical style. Given that said style can be found inother games I own, to the pawn shop Sword of Mana goes. — Shining Soul: I absolutely hated it, and it should have left my precious collectionlong ago already. Look for the expression “to overstay one’s time” in thedictionary, and you’ll totally find a picture of that game.    PSP: — Class of Heroes: Let’s face it, I’ll never touch that game again. Not only do I ownmuch better FPDC, but I also own Class of Heroes 2, which boasts ahigher Metacritic score and is probably better by sheer virtue of being asequel. — Adventures to Go: Nice grindy treat, but no cult classic potential there.— FinalFantasy II: As far as grindy 8-bit remakes go, I’ll have Final Fantasy I overits little brother any day of the week. Also, there’s no way I’m ever tacklingthat darn final dungeon again.    DS: — Rhapsody– A Musical Adventure: It wasn’t memorable back in the days, and it’s even moreforgettable now that I have tons of better RPGs under my belt. — DragonQuest V: I know, I know; but I cannot lie to myself. DQV is one of themost revered DQ episodes, and a cult classic turn-based RPG; but it’s nocult classic of mine, alas. I’d rather go back to DQIX if I need a DQfix, or to any other entry that makes the New Classics cut.— Etrian Odyssey: I’m surprised myself, honestly. Or maybe not so much, actually:although my EO run was an amazing epopee, it was also tedious as allheck. Not only that, but said run unfolded right along an unpleasant time in mylife; the two memories are now linked in my brain, which makes me stray awayfrom EO. And heck, I own the brighter, more player-friendly 3DS remakeanyway; so it’s not like I’m parting with that game forever, is it? — Children of Mana: I have the fondest memories of that game, but let’s face it: Iprobably won’t ever feel like playing it again. Especially now that I have waybetter Hack’n’Slashes at my disposal.  — FinalFantasy Fables – Chocobo Tales: A cute, and ultimately totally forgettablegame. Nuff said.—Lifesigns: The one run I cleared will be enough for the rest of my life, thankyou very much.— Suikoden Tierkreis: The plot twist was neat, but the gameplay was tepid at best. We allknow I’m here for the latter first and last, which dooms Tierkreis tothe pawn shop.   Vita:— Conception II: I had a serious blast with it when I played it; still, it didn’t leave anyreal imprint in my gamer’s soul. A cult classic of mine this is not.— Utawarerumono– Mask of Deception: Let’s face it, I’ll never replay that game. I fanciedneither the story nor the cast, and the gameplay is too anaemic to justify areplay. The sequel will probably face the same fate once I’m done playing — itif I ever get round to playing it, that is. — Criminal Girls 2: No need to keep that sorry sequel when I like the original way more.—Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3: I love the series to pieces, but thatepisode has to go. Way too much of a good thing, indeed.— Tales of Hearts R: I loved the first twenty hours, that much is undeniable; still, Idon’t think I’ll ever want to replay those 20 hours again. In fact, I have yetto encounter a Tales game I wanna replay; if that game actually exists, Talesof Hearts R it is not. — Psychedelica of the Black Butterfly: I can hardly remember anything about that game today,which speaks volumes. Off with its head! — Psychedelica of the Ashen Hawk: Although I still love the art and the atmosphere, theunsatisfying endings and the many loose ends ultimately soiled the game for me.Too bad, so sad.— Code : Realize:  Sure enough, I managed to enjoy that game after giving it a second chance. But we're beyond giving second chances, trying to recoup gaming investments and toiling to find redeeming qualities in each and every game now. This is the New Classic era, folks; only the very best can stay, and CR does not qualify as the very best. I've found otomes I love way more since, starting with my beloved Nightshade; on top of that, the only route I like in CR is Victor's route, and that doesn't justify holding onto the game.  3DS:— Moco Moco Friends: I own enough Pokemon clones — and Pokemon games,for that matter — to dispense with that half-baked title. — Return to Popolocrois: A game I dropped nearly as soon as I started it is obviously no cultclassic of mine. — Code of Princess: It was bad then, and it’s worse today. Also, MC Solange cannot hold acandle to Blaze from Streets of Rage or to the Senran Kagura castwhen it comes to sheer badassery.   — Fire Emblem Awakening: I really loved my run of it, that much is undeniable; but Ialso feel I’ve had my fill of that game for a lifetime. As far as FEgoes, Echoes is most definitely my ultimate jam. — Persona Q2 – New Cinema Labyrinth: I loved it, but let’s face it: it was all aboutthe cast and the fighting system, and I can find them both somewhere else. Thecrawling was frustrating, the dungeons were ugly, and it’s another game tied tounpleasant IRL memories. One run was enough; if I wanna get myself some PersonaQ again, I’ll roll with the prequel, thank you very much.— StellaGlow: With hindsight, the plot twist severed all ties between me and this game.Trying to shove twenty extra hours of play down my throat was a betrayal Istill cannot forgive to this day; and so, Stella Glow has to go.— Tales of the Abyss: For the longest time, I thought I would replay that game one day;but I know now that it won’t ever happen. Still, I wrote a parting postabout it, if only to acknowledge its importance in my gaming career. Indeed, myfirst Tales entry left an indelible imprint on my gamer’s soul — forbetter or for worse. Switch:— Café Enchanté: I loved it, I really did; but I don’t think I’ll ever want to read itagain. It’s too harrowing, too heart-breaking — and it’s not like I’ll forgetthat soul-wrenching story any time soon anyway. — Robotic;NotesElite&Dash: It was a fun ride, but not one I’ll tackle again any time soon.Especially when my precious collection is full to the brim with much betterVNs. — Kotodama:The farthest thing from a cult classic you could ever imagine. Nuff said.— Piofiore: Fated Memories: I won't deny I had an absolute blast playing that otome. However, I realise now that nearly all the fun came from the danger factor and the thrill of trying to make it in one piece through the routes. Now that the deed is done, PFM's appeal simply evaporated. — AnimalCrossing – New Horizons: Let’s face it: the Animal Crossing series iscompletely an acquired taste as far as I’m concerned. I can enjoy those gamesif I try hard enough, that much is sure; but they’ll never, ever be cultclassics of mine. — Pokemon Mystery Dungeon – Rescue Team DX: It was a nice ride all right; but with hindsight, that niceride was ultimately quite forgettable. Should I get a sudden PMD itch,I’d rather run to Explorers of Sky or to Gates to Infinity, whichtouched me way more and left a deeper mark in my gamer’s soul. — Is it Wrong to Try to Pick up Girls in a Dungeon: This is the last time I’m typingthat game’s stupidly long title. It was nicely entertaining, but I have tons ofbetter ARPG at my fingertips. There youhave it, dear fellow gamers: the tried-and-tested games that will have tovacate the premises and make way for the real cult classics. That first examinationof my collection was pretty interesting, I must say: some games I kindadisliked back in the days, such as Lord of Magna, finally made the cut,while others I rather enjoyed finally failed to impress on the long run. We cannow move on to the meatier part, namely the tryin’n’testing of my many stillunplayed games. Until then, dear fellow gamers, keep doing your thing and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Brilliant Diamond: The Glameow Battle Report, a.k.a. How Roark made me cry tears of blood", "date": "06/02/2022", "text": "When I set foot in Oreburgh City, little did I know how hard it would prove to get out of it. Sure, my little Stormcloud was not thestrongest of ‘Mons, even with her boosted Attack; and she wasn’t armed with thebest Move Pool, wielding only Moves that were not very effective against Rock.Still, this wasn’t my first Rock Gym under rocky (ha-ha) circumstances, and Iwas confident I could make it. Surely Glameow couldn’t struggle more thanVivillon, now could she? Ooh yes, she sure could. And boy, she did.  I started panicking when I discovered that my Lv.10 Stormcloudcouldn’t beat Worker Colin’s Lv.7 Geodude and Onix in Oreburgh Cave. Now, whatis Roark’s team made of? A Lv.12 Geodude and a Lv.12 Onix, with a Lv.14Cranidos on top. Two ‘Mons with stellar Defense and one with stellar Attack,all armed with pretty decent offensive Moves. I went to theGym to test the waters; and not only did I get my arse handed to me by Roark’sGeodude, but I couldn’t even get past the Junior Trainers’ Lv. 8 and Lv.10Geodudes. In a nutshell: I was in deep, deep trouble.  I needed level-grinding, that much was obvious. However, brutelevel-grinding alone wouldn’t do the trick; I also needed a strategy. The mainissue was how little damage Stormcloud dealt; combined with her measly Defense,she would invariably get knocked out before her opponent. Thus, I needed to: a)boost my Attack, and b) find a way to take less damage. The first part of thatplan was carried out by grinding in the grassy patch on Route 207, untilStormcloud reached Lv.17 and learnt Aerial Ace. Not just grinding on any ‘Mon,mind you; grinding exclusively on wild Machops, in order to get precious AttackEVs. For the second part, I resorted to a combination of three elements: Growl,Hypnosis and the X-Defend I picked in Oreburgh Mine.   And now comes the battle report! I opened the fight withHypnosis to put Geodude to sleep, resetting until it worked; otherwise, Geodudewould use Defense Curl or Rollout, making things harder for me. Once Geodudewas asleep, I used my X-Defense and proceeded to pummel that darn rock intooblivion with Aerial Ace. I did the same thing with Onix, using Hypnosis againwhen it woke up to put it back to sleep and do my thing unhindered. Rinse andrepeat with Cranidos, with a couple of Growls on top to ensure it wouldn’tdestroy me with Headbutt or Bulldoze if it woke up before I was done. Not gonnalie: there was a fair bit of luck involved, and it took me a couple of tries toget the right combination of successful Hypnosis, long naps, critical hits and convenientmisses. But! I finally made it past Roark, and it’s all that matters. I’m notthe best Pokemon strategist out there; but I’m always happy and proudwhen I manage to put together a viable strategy, even if it involves luck — which is almostalways the case. Let’s say this is just my very own strategic style, shall we? 😜 Take care and see ya soon,dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Brilliant Diamond: The Purugly Solo Run", "date": "02/02/2022", "text": "Purugly, and by extension its youngish form Glameow, is many things atonce. She’s one of the rarest regional cats in the whole series: not only does shesolely appear in Pearl in her home region, but she can also only befound in the wild in White 2 and AS&OR beyond that — and inridiculously elusive locations to boot. She’s also, according to my personaltheory, a hilarious and over-the-top Pokemon translation of thereal-life phenomenon that sees sparkly teenagers morph into grumpy housewives overthe years (Diggersby being the just-as-hilarious-and-over-the-top male versionof that phenomenon). Last but not least, and that’s the point we’ll be focusingon here, she’s the most exaggerated version I’ve handled so far of the regionalcat trope — that is, acute and weak kitty evolving into a badass full-grown feline powerhouse.     I’ll say it: cruising with Glameow for 38 levels was horrible.I’ve handled a number of frail kitten ‘Mons over the years, from Skitty toPurrloin to Litleo to Litten; and none, none of them performed as poorlyand struggled as mightily on the battlefield than my Stormcloud. The first Gym was the most epic roadblock of them all, a bastion so formidable that it deserves a dedicated post; yet even after that, my poor kitty was not out of the woods. She took so much damage and failed so invariably at one-shooting that I resorted to a combination of Fake Out + another offensive Move while holding the Metronome to take down foes and escape battles unscathed.  The weird thing is, Glameow really shouldn’t have struggled so hard,at least on paper. She boasts base stats similar to Skitty’s, with a highertotal than the latter to boot; on top of that, my Stormcloud boasted evenhigher Attack thanks to her Lonely Nature. Glameow is also blessed with apretty decent learnset including Aerial Ace, Thief, U-Turn, Shock Wave andThunderbolt — all MovesStormcloud came to learn before evolving. Last but not least, she had Own Tempo, which prevents Confusion and blocks Intimidate. So how come I struggled so mightilywith her, while I managed to clear a full run with a Skitty? I have noexplanation at hand other than the regions themselves, really. Maybe Hoenn isSkitty-friendly, while Sinnoh isn’t Glameow-friendly. Maybe the remakes alsoramped up the difficulty, how knows? What I do know is that for the first timeever, I skipped the Junior Trainers in a Gym, and I carefully avoided allHikers until I hit the much-awaited Lv. 38.Indeed, things changed for the better after that. Purugly is sturdierand hits way harder than Glameow, while remaining uber-fast; this means that Icould at long last one-shoot the opposition, and withstand damage whennecessary. Not only that, but Stormcloud also got to wield sweetly powerful Movessuch as Slash, Body Slam, Shadow Ball and Shadow Claw. Combined with Stormcloud’s nifty Lv.80 and the Metronome, my ultimate Move Pool featured above should haveguaranteed an easy ride against the Elite Four… Except it didn’t. I hit a wall,just like in my Jirachi run; and only endless trial-and-error and the copioususe of Battle Items ensured my final triumph. That final showdown was neitherfun nor fulfilling, that’s for sure; but somehow, it also didn’t feel right.Yep, it sure doesn’t feel right to have a hard time with the Elite Four afterhours of smooth sailing. And not just once, but twice… Hey, do you know what itfeels like? It feels like a difficulty spike! A difficulty spike teeming withWake-up Call Bosses, which I cannot remember encountering in Gen IV.   And you know what? I won’t bother checking that assumption, even forthe sake of scientific curiosity. Following that post’s convenient advice, Isnatched myself two Lucky Eggs, which I’ll use in future BD&SP runs.It’s not just a matter of making thing easier and smoother for lazy little me,mind you: I just dig the feeling of reaching Lv.100 by the end of a run, as itreveals my lone ranger’s full potential and gives me a nice and neat sense ofcompletion. As a matter of fact, this may become an unwritten rule for futuresolo runs — but hey,that’s a story for later.  Anyway, that’s two BD&SP runs under my belt! That’s abirthday gift well enjoyed, methinks ^^. I’ll let the pair rest for the timebeing; but when I’m done playing them more, I’ll write a post about my overallimpressions. For now, suffice to say that I was not disappointed at all, andthat I deem these remakes a worthy addition to my Pokemon collection.Until I see you soon with more gaming goodness, take care of yourselves, dearfellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Shining Pearl: The Jirachi Solo Run ", "date": "29/01/2022", "text": "So here’s the story, dear fellow gamers: after getting the latest Pokemonpair as a (most fitting) birthday present from my sister, I immediately proceeded to dive into the updated charms of Gen IV. For that first tripthrough shiny revamped Sinnoh, I picked Chimchar, a Starter I had yet to runsolo with. However, I quickly developed mixed feelings about that choice: notonly did I kinda dislike Chimchar’s new sprite, but I also couldn’t shake off the thought thatit would be more interesting and scientifically accurate to cruise with thefire ape in Platinum. I was still mulling over the whole situation whenI reached Floaroma Town and innocently talked to that nice gentleman standingnext to the town’s entrance; and lo and behold, said gentleman rewarded mysocializing efforts by offering me a Jirachi.  I didn’t know yet that having a Sw&Sh save file on yourSwitch was the key to obtaining that Jirachi, and I was left gaping at thescreen in sheer disbelief; but as I recovered, the face of my run was changedforever. Pray tell, when would I get again such a golden chance to run with afriggin’ Legendary ‘Mon? Maybe never, that’s when! (Turns out that BD&SPactually offer not just one, but two other such chances; but that’s a story foranother time.) And so, I instantly proceeded to dump my Chimchar into thenext Pokemon box and to hit the road with my lovely Citrine.    Legendaries have stellar Stats as a rule, so no need to expand on that;let’s just say that one-shooting was our bread and butter from beginning to end— or nearlyso; but more on that soon. I usually love double Typing, and Citrine’sSteel/Psychic Type didn’t disappoint — nine resistances, one immunity and no double weakness,baby! As for Moves, I used two main pools, which you can see above. The interestingthing is that Citrine only reached Lv.70 at the end of my run; and so, I missedentirely on the three last Moves in her arsenal, namely Double Edge (learnt atLv.77), Last Resort (learnt at Lv.91) and Doom Desire (learnt at Lv.98). DoomDesire wouldn’t have been a great fit for a solo setting; but boy, would I haveloved to wield the other two!   In fact, I would have loved to reach Level 90-or-so overall beforethe final showdown, interesting Moves or not. The BD&SP Elite Four features ‘Mons with levels rangingfrom 55 to 66, holding all sorts of annoying Items; and, well… My Lv.70 Citrinestruggled. Not overly so, but enough to force me to use a couple of BattleItems for the first time in my run. That somewhat anticlimactic ending dampened my spirits ; combined with the missing Moves thing, it nearly makes me want to tackle a Jirachi run redux. The question is, can I get another Jirachi? It should be possible, especially considering that I own two Switches; but that's a bridge I'll cross if/when I get to it.  Anyway, did that run change the way I view Legendaries? Ooooh yes, it suredid. I used to mourn the fact that these ‘Mons were forever out of my reach, andfantasize about their utter awesomeness; but I don’t anymore. Not only was Ifinally blessed with a Legendary Solo Run, but I also realised that these ‘Mons,as stellar as they are, are not invincible. They have their weaknesses like anyother ‘Mons; and I’ve cruised with a number of regular ‘Mons that perform ashonourably as Jirachi in a solo setting — think Absol, Tyranitar, Zangoose or Charizard. Nowdon’t get me wrong: that was an awesome run still — much smoother and easier than the one thatfollowed it. I’ll see you soon with the report for that run, dearfellow gamers; until then, keep gaming and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Let’s Go Pikachu: Sweet electric", "date": "12/01/2022", "text": "Hullo, dear fellow gamers! Let’s not pretend to be surprised that Ifinally purchased Let’s Go Pikachu after swearing blind that I wouldstick to Let’s Go Eevee and move on straight to the run report, shallwe? I needed something sweet, cute and comforting after polishing off DragonSinker, and LGP filled the bill perfectly.  My cute Spark of Joy was the most adorable female Pikachu youcould imagine; and fill my heart with joy did she indeed. Her utter lovelinessmade me forgive her lacklustre prowess on the battlefield, as well as hershallow learnset; however, it wasn’t enough to make me forget them entirely. Everytime I took damage because I failed to one-shoot something, I was reminded thatPikachu have always been, is and will forever be crappy solo run material.  Having said that, Partner Pikachu is still the best version of allavailable Pikachus — i.e. regular Pikachu, Alolan Pikachu and Starter Pikachu. For one, itgets a lovely stat boost, similar to the one granted to Partner Eevee. My Sparkof Joy’s Modest Nature made her the perfect mixed attacker, which in turnallowed her to make the most of these three exclusive Let’s Go Movesother Pikachus could only dream off. We have Zippy Zap, an 80 power Physical Move,Splishy Splash, a 90 power Special Move with a 30% chance of paralysing, andFloaty Fall, a 90 power Physical Move with a 30% flinch chance. I completedthat awesome trio with Brick Break, and got what is arguably the best PikachuMove pool ever.  Brick Break, a Move Pikachu didn't wield in Yellow, was obviously an ace in the hole. It make short work of Pikachu’s main kantonian foe, namely Giovanni, and generally saved me fromtrembling with fear at the sight of a Geodude or an Onix. Spark of Joy was much betterequipped to handle Kanto’s challenges than her Yellow counterpart, fromBrock’s Gym to the Champion himself.   I don’t have much to add, really. It was a lovely run, and it gave me whatI needed, namely easy grinding and pleasant feelings. I don’t regret purchasingthat game after all; although I definitely prefer Partner Eevee, I may wellwant to cruise again with Partner Pikachu one of these days. I’ll see you soonwith a bit of extra Pokemon goodness, dear fellow gamers; until then,keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "The 2022 Blueprint", "date": "07/01/2022", "text": "Hello and Happy New Year, dear fellow gamers! I wish us all the bestfor 2022, in gaming as well as in other areas! ^^  2022 means a lot to me, and not only because it’s already shaping upto be much better than 2021. For one, it marks the 10th anniversaryof my Second Coming of Gaming, which unfolded over 2012 as I had just turned30. For another, as you guessed already, it marks my entry into the glorious 40s— hooray! Imade it there! And boy, am I glad to leave my 30s behind. They were an incredibly fast-pacedand rocky decade, full of tremendous delights and heart-wrenching sorrows. Thehighs were very high, the lows were very low, and each year brought more changesand plot twists than I could handle — which is probably why my mind folded at the endof those ten chaotic years. What I want for the next ten years is kindness,appeasement, and generally enjoying life at my own pace. And last but notleast, I want to play games.  Yes indeed; my passion for gaming is still burning as bright as ever. I realised over the course of bitchy 2021 howimportant gaming is to me; it fills a niche that nothing else in my lifeoccupies, halfway between meditation, escapism and endless provider of reward feelings.And lo and behold, gaming was even at the centre of a turnaround point in myrecent recovery process. I was in bed playing a game I’ll write about soon; andas I played, I felt a sweet mental tingling, a hunger for more, that Ihadn’t felt for a long time. That game was my beacon of joy for the followingdays, and it opened the door for more feelings of excitement and anticipation overother things.  Long story short: I wanna play games in 2022, and probably beyond. Butfor now, let’s focus on the former, and end the suspense: not only is the NewClassics phase definitely going to be a thing, but it has started already! Iwasn’t even meaning to, mind you: I found myself playing a game my gaminginstinct vehemently demanded, and loving it to pieces… Before said gaminginstinct decided it was enough for now and claimed another game after a meretwo hours of play. I think those last two years of not playing much are finallycatching up to me, and my gaming instinct is coming back with a vengeance — and anunquenchable thirst for new gaming horizons.  So, here’s the plan for the next weeks: first, I’ll write and post thereports for the runs I finished recently; and then, I’ll move on to the NewClassics reports. I’ll tackle games in no particular order, just following my ever-dependablegaming instinct. Boy, I have an inkling this gaming year is gonna be funindeed. Until next time, dear fellow gamers, keep doing your thing, and takecare!"},
{"title": "Dragon Sinker: Pint-sized Dragon Quest", "date": "22/12/2021", "text": "This Kemco offering was the first game I tackled after the reasons formy recent tiredness were uprooted. It’s a sweet and simple game, and it’s astraightforward grinding fest — exactly what I needed at the time.  The ties with Dragon Quest should appear immediately to any RPGveteran. From the MC’s horned helmet to the graphical style, which faithfullyemulates DQ’s first Famicom entry, without forgetting the story that has youvanquish an uber-powerful dragon, everything screams Dragon Quest. Butfor me, the most blatant and deliciously nostalgic tie lay in the class system,which conjured sweet memories of my DQIX solo run.   If you remember well, I mastered all classes during the 200-or-sohours of that run; and lo and behold, Dragon Sinker gives you the possibilityto do just that — only in a much, much shorter time. The game offers 16 classes tied to16 secondary characters on top of the MCs’ three exclusive classes; and these16 classes can be mastered by all 16 characters. One can immediately see thepotential for bottomless grindiness here — and how totally apropos this game's name is. You can obviously stick to the basicsby having each character keep their respective class and leave it at that;but you can also go crazy completionist and have each character master eachclass. Factor in the tweakable difficulty level, and you can get the mostinsane grindy epopee of them all. As for me, I went with the former option in Easy Mode. Mastering all16+3 classes took roughly 17 hours, and I reaped a mighty bunch of ClassScrolls as a reward for my efforts. Class Scrolls are nifty little items thatallow you to teach a class’ passive ability to any character; as I had rolledwith MC Abram for the whole game, it felt natural to use them all on him. Thatturned him into a powerhouse — and final boss Wyrmvarg into a total pushover: it took the grand totalof one turn to obliterate its first form, and two turns tosend its second form packing. That might have been a bit too easy; on the otherhand, I was tired at the time, so that was probably the final showdown I needed.  Long story short: Dragon Sinker is a sweet grindy treat that youshould totally play if you’re a sucker for all things 8-bit RPG and classsystems. I’ll see you soon with more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers; takecare, and Merry Christmas to you all!"},

Turned out that I wasn’tjust being tired: I was actually suffering from a bout of burnout-ishdepression, caused by a nasty combination of too much pressure and too little pleasureover 2021. That was a nasty b*tch of a year for me; and as I’m getting betterby the day, I fervently hope that 2022 will be kinder.   Anyway, I was ordered by my doctor to perform pleasant activities on adaily basis, as part of my recovery process. To keep gaming was a no-brainer insuch circumstances, and I did. It was hard at first, as I got tired reallyquickly; but I soldiered on, and managed to clear three runs in the last sixweeks. I’m gonna post run reports in the next days/weeks, as I keep gaming on adaily basis. I’m still a bit too weak to tackle the New Classics phase rightnow; but it will most certainly be a thing in 2022.

{"title": "Pokemon Ultra Sun: The Vikavolt Solo Run", "date": "18/10/2021", "text": "I tackled that run with a single purpose: to pave the way for futuretrade-related Breeding in my dedicated UltraSun cartridge. Of course, this was also a perfect opportunity to discover akickass Gen VII ‘Mon — preferably an early one. Lucky me, Grubbin was ready forthe recruiting on Route 1! A Bug ‘Mon with a three-stage evolution and a never-played-before Type: what wasnot to love, seriously? The Vikavolt line turned out to be one of the mostinteresting Bug lines ever created since the dawn of the series. It’s not justthe creature’s double Bug-Electric Type, mind you; it’s also its ridiculouslyhuge learnset and its ever-changing Stat distribution, which made for constantsurprises and delights.  First, them Stats. The Vikavolt line boasts highly unusual Stats for a Bug ‘Mon, but also overall. It starts with well-roundedStats as Grubbin, then drops Speed in favour of high defensive Stats andsky-high Attack as it evolves into Charjabug. Stellar Attack for amid-evolution Bug ‘Mon is already unusual enough, but there’s more: uponevolving into Vikavolt, Charjabug gets a complete reversal of its offensiveStats. Its Attack plummets and crashes, while its Sp. Attack goes through theroof and beyond. This means two things: first, the Vikavolt line rocks at one-shooting (and I totallymade the most of it); second, a drastic Move pool overhaul had to be planned asmy Foudre crossed the ultimateevolution stage. Which leads me to…   Second, them Moves! The plan was simple: to go all Physical withGrubbin and Charjabug, and all Special with Vikavolt. It was easy enough topull off at first, and Foudre boasted two perfect sets of Physical Moves:Spark, Bug Bite, Bite and Vice Grip as a Grubbin, and Spark, X-Scissors, Crunchand Acrobatics as a Charjabug. A super-heavy Bug ‘Mon wielding a Flying Move —let that sink in. Pokemonlogics for the win! Anyway, things became hairy as soon as Foudre became aVikavolt. She learnt Thunderbolt upon evolving, which was neat enough; but Ihad to sweat to put together the rest of my 100% Special Move Pool, let me tellyou that. I had to scour Alola to get my paws on Flash Cannon, Energy Ball anda Ground-Type Hidden Power; but the worst offender by far was bloody Bug Buzz.I obviously wanted a Bug Move, because STAB; and it so happens that Bug Buzz ispart of Vikavolt’s levelling-up learnset. But wait, there’s a catch: Vikavoltlearns Bug Buzz at lv. 31. Foudre was beyond that level when she evolved; andso, a Move Reminder intervention was mandatory to gain access to that Move. Doyou know where the Alolan MR is? At the Pokemon centre of the game right beforethe bloody Elite Four, that’s where.(Insert murderous eyes) But hey; better late than never, right?  Anyway, it’s not like those Move diversions prevented my Foudre fromone-shooting every living thing. I’ll say it: the Vikavolt line is one of themost badass Bug lines ever created. It starts off strong, and only getsstronger with time and evolutions. Interestingly enough, I still had a coupleof tough-as-nails fights — most notably the Fire Trial and the showdownagainst bloody Necrozma, which required grinding and a hefty dose of strategizing and luck. Look, I said it before,and I’ll say it again: Gen VII is savage.It’s slow, it’s hard, and it’s borderline unfair when it pits your team leaderagainst two ‘Mons in Trials. I deem it the hardest Gen out there, period.   Playing UltraSun after myrecent discovery of Gen VIII made me realize how much of a transitional gamethe former is. With its morally ambiguous story and its villain team that’s notreally a villain team after all, Gen VII’s last entry is very much a harbingerof Sw&Sh. Another instance of GenVIII foreshadowing is Ultra Sun’ssluggish pace, which I could very much have done without — all the more so asunlike Sw&Sh, US doesn’t include uber-fast candy-basedlevelling-up.   With that said, my current Pokemonadventures come to an end, dear fellow gamers. I’ll dive into the series soonenough, though: the Gen IV remixes are on their merry way, and I’ve not touchedthat Gen for a whopping two years. I’ll gladly mop the floor with you again,Barry! See ya soon with more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers, and takecare!"},
{"title": "Pokemon X: The Florges Solo Run", "date": "09/10/2021", "text": "This run has been a long time coming, ooh yes precious. I’ve wanted tocruise with that most delicate of Fairy ‘Mons since my very first run of X&Y;yet mysteriously, I never managed to do so — until now. I wanted to cruise with a WhiteFlower Florges for fickle reasons understood only by my gaming instinct; thismeant that I had to recruit awhite Flabébé after the first Gym. Given its 1% appearance rate, I feared Iwould spend one hour running around before getting a glimpse of thecreature — cue mySkitty run of Sapphire; but low and behold, a white Flabébé was kindenough to appear and join the crew after a mere five encounters. My pretty Moonlight boasted a Bashful Nature, which allowed meto experience the purest version of Florges. And well, that purest versiondidn’t exactly dazzle me at first. The thing is, both Flabébé and Floette arepainfully weak and fragile, making them very much unfit for a solo setting andforcing me to have healing items at hand at all times. Not only that, but theirlearnset sucks: Disarming Voice, Fairy Wind, Razor Leaf, Magical Leafand Vine Whip don’t amount to much in the hands of Flabébé and Floette, let metell you. And pray tell, why on earth does a Fairy ‘Mon know so many GrassMoves? Heck, the Florges line actually learn more Grass Moves than FairyMoves while being pure Fairy — which means no STAB, which sucks. If I wantedto wield a crap ton of Grass Moves, I’d cruise with a Grass ‘Mon, thank youvery much.   Anyway; Ineeded a killer Move pool for the late stages, and I proceeded to assemble itas soon as I could. A visit to the Move reminder allowed me to learn Moonblast,and I got my paws on Energy Ball and Psychic right before and after the 8thGym. Very late indeed; but still better than never, and right on time for theultimate showdown. With Florges being much stronger than its pre-evos, thingswent pretty smoothly, with only the Steel arena requiring a bunch of BattleItems to be conquered.   Long story short: the Florges line is kinda mismatched, and takes anawful lot of time to reveal its full potential; but that the end of the day — and the run — it’s stillperfectly decent solo run material. My revisitation of X&Y is overfor now; but not my Pokemon endeavours, as I still have to unveil my ultimate run report of the summer. Until then, take care,dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Diggersby Solo Run", "date": "22/09/2021", "text": "Follow me in my annual summer revisitation of X&Y, dearfellow gamers! I've not gone overboard this year: just a pair of runs, one in eachgame. Opening this 2021 Pokemon Summer Season is none other than Diggersby, a‘Mon that piqued my curiosity lately. Not only does the Kalosrabbit belong to a type I’ve never cruised with, but its very, erm, specialcry and its metamorphosis from cute little critter to old fart with a beer gutis the stuff hilarious moments are made off. This is the Purugly story all overagain, and that called for a special narrative: I decided to rename my Bunnelby‘Burpee’ as soon as it crossed the evolutionary rubicon — or she, asit turned out. Yup, my Bunnelby was a female, which made the whole situationeven more impossibly hilarious. Let me tell you, I had some serious funin Pokemon Amie.   My Burpee was fun to cruise with indeed; but how did she fareperformance-wise? Let’s say things were interesting. She was very much atank, which is not surprising given her Ground Type; however, her Lonely Natureshook things up a bit, making her more fitting solo run material. She was not aone-shooter by any means, mind you; however, she revealed her true potential inthe Elite Four showdown by taking down all five Trainers without breaking a sweatnor Battle Items.   Of course, such a sweetly epic conclusion wasn’t much of a surprise — because indeed,who wouldn’t bulldoze the Elite Four with that Move pool you see above?It took some time to reach such Move awesomeness, but it was totally worth thewait. Diggersby’s learnset beyond these fab four is nothing extraordinaryindeed: Bounce has potential but is too fiddly to use, Grass Knot doesn’t getto shine much in Kalos, Dig has too little PP and Rock Tomb can miss.  Long story short: Kalos is still as lovely to cruise as ever, my runwas a smooth affair that clocked at exactly 12 hours, and Ground Typecan shine in a solo setting. I still have to try a pure Ground ‘Mon, mind you;but that first foray was encouraging, and makes me wanna explore the Type more.I’ll see you soon with my second Kalos revisitation of the summer, dear fellowgamers; until then, take care and keep gaming!"},
{"title": "The New Classics", "date": "09/09/2021", "text": "Let’s face it, dear fellow gamers: I own way too many games.  I knew it already, mind you; but that knowledge was kinda abstract,and didn’t compute with its real-life consequences. Said consequences beingthat there is no way in hell I can manage to play and enjoy all thegames I own in the rest of my lifetime.  Mind you again, I probably could if I wanted to: by followingthe OWOG system to a T, six-or-so years would be enough to play all thegames in my precious collection. But the thing is, I’m curious about a millionthings besides gaming, and I’m a serial game replayer to boot. This means thatthose six years are a totally unrealistic estimate; twenty to twenty-five yearsseem much closer to the mark. Not only is such a time requirement stupidly enormous, but I mightactually end up spending an uncanny amount of time playing games I onlymarginally enjoy, instead of replaying games I adore. That is a glaring issuebecause a) I tend to only want the best as a rule, and b) I don’t know how muchtime I have left, and I’d rather spend it playing my own cult classics over andover rather than plod through barely likeable games.      Something’s obviously got to give; and that something is none otherthan the very size of my precious collection — that decrease in size being directly correlated to an increase in quality. The master plan is pretty simple, dearfellow gamers: to shear my collection until only my very own cultclassics are left standing — hence this post’s title.    I have to balance that grand undertaking with my gaming curiosity, aswell as with my limited gaming time; but lucky me, I have devised the perfectsystem to do so. That system is a variation of the ‘One-Hour-Review’ systemcreated by my fellow gamer and blogger Kina — mighty shout-out to her! See, I’ve noticed onecrucial thing over the years: the games I like the most are always gamesI like immediately. With that axiom firmly in tow, I’mgoing to sift through my entire collection and sort things out.    Practically, I’ll take a two-hour bite of every single game in mycollection starting now. If that bite dazzles me, the game will begranted the cult classic status and remain in my Unikeep binders, for alleternity. If that bite leaves me cold, the game will be pawned to my favouritevideo game shop, to be rightfully enjoyed by another fellow gamer — take a pieceand pass it on, to quote the Red Hot Chili Peppers.   Of course, therewill be a short and sweet review of each and every two-hour session, for yourenjoyment as well as mine.

Geddyand other favourite gaming bloggers of mine have been posting less and/or branchingout lately; and even though I seemingly didn’t change my posting pace, Iactually paid less attention to gaming these last months. That semi-departure from gaming was forced on me by externalcircumstances; nonetheless, it helped me determine exactly which place I wannagive gaming in my life. No gaming at all would be an aberration I cannot evenenvision for the life of me; on the other hand, treating gaming as a part-timejob of sorts is definitely a ground I don’t wanna tread again.

{"title": "Why I may never stop playing video games ", "date": "18/08/2021", "text": "I friggin’ ADORE video games. You know it, I know it, it’s no secretwhatsoever.Love being pretty much this mysterious thing that cannot berationalized, I never bothered trying to analyse the reason I love video gamesso much. It was an intense coup de foudre, friggin’ love at first play,and it’s been a burning passion ever since. There has been teary,heart-wrenching breakups and reconciliations in the process, and the loveis now burning brighter and fiercer than ever before. (For the interested, thefull story can be read here and there.) On the other hand, it’s no problem writing down how playing videogames make me feel. I’m not referring to the fact that gaming makes meall giddy and happy, because that’s a no-brainer. We’re dealing with moresubtle and complex feelings that can be encompassed by three words: discovery,escapism and freshness. Discovery: Each andevery game is a trip through unknown and uncharted territories. Sure enough,there are tropes and gameplay mechanics that pop up on a regular basis; but theway they are used, and the coating around them, is always unique. A game isalways tied to a specific, one-of-a-kind atmosphere, and basking in thatatmosphere is something I relish and never get bored of. Cherry on the cake,knowing a given game like the back of my hand doesn’t erase that discoveryfactor; on the other hand, each replay adds new emotions and atmosphereelements to the mix. Escapism: I love the realworld to pieces, that much is sure; but gosh, do I also love to dive intoparallel universes through gaming. Gaming worlds act as breathers: they arewelcome diversions that take your mind away from your personal life, only tolet you go back to it with a relaxed mind. Some say that gaming sessions areakin to meditation to them, and I fully subscribe to that view ofthings.    Freshness: Last butnot least, gaming act as a refresher. I kid you not: gaming resetsthe world for me. Every time I start a game and think of my run the nextmorning, I feel a wave of freshness in my mind, as well as a surge of giddiness;and that sprightliness suffuses the rest of my life, makingeverything else feel new and sparkly. And just like Discovery, this happens evenwith games I know already, providing that I haven’t played them for long enoughto erase most memories of my last run.  We’re now coming to this post’s title. Not only do I love gaming, notonly does it make me feel happy and giddy, but it also gives birth to thesedeeper and more layered feelings. Mind you, I could probe even further, andexpand on even subtler ramifications — such as the fact that my dreams routinely gotmore complex since I started gaming again, or that gaming has taught me values I use IRL. An activity that generates such a vibrant latticeof delightful emotions, feelings and mental constructions is bound to last, andto take an ever-stronger hold on my life as runs and memories pile up. I restmy case, dear fellow gamers: gaming and I are meant to roll together indeed!See ya soon with more gaming goodness, and take care!"},
{"title": "The Pokemon Sword & Shield Report, Part 4: The ultimate overview", "date": "06/08/2021", "text": "After three posts of shameless praise and vibrant declarations of loveto Galar, it’s time to wrap up my S&S report on a more general, yethigher than ever, note. I think you’re well aware by now that I friggin’adore Galar indeed, dear fellow gamers; and here are a few extra reasons Ilove that newest of Pokemon regions so darn much.   The first thing I have to get out of my chest is: Galar is the absolute best interpretation of a real-life region, ever. I’d bet myarse that it’s because GameFreak dared ditch many Pokemon tropes at longlast, in favour of a more faithful recreation. Listing all the things thatscream Britain in S&S would be way too long and tedious forall of us, so I’ll just quote one of these things: the football tie. Heck, thisis absolute genius, pure homage brilliance. Not only is the link with Britainobvious even to a non-football fan like myself, but it also fits perfectly intothe grand scheme of Pokemon things. Indeed, it makes perfect sense that Pokemonbattles should be a sport people pay to watch, and not an arcane activity practiced byonly a few, in Gyms no one can enter but Pokemon Trainers. I can only wish GameFreak will keep that trend going, and offer usmore regions deliciously faithful to their real-life inspirations.  Anotherthing I have to praise vigorously is the fact that your Trainer occupy theirrightful place — namelycentre stage. As the player, you’re in the game again — or maybe like never before, actually. No moreattention-whorey friends and rivals stealing the spotlight from you, no morePokemon Professor treating you as a lackey, no more villain team trying toconquer the world: the game is very blatantly about you and your questto clear the Gym Challenge, and everything else is treated as a distraction youshouldn’t bother with. Heck, the game goes as far as to have Leon and Soniarepeatedly tell you that they’ll take care of Macro Cosmos issues and that youshould focus on your own goals. Wait, is that crew actually handling thingslike the adults they are, and letting me be a regular 14-year-old? Blimey,that’s certainly a first in a Pokemon game!   Next, I wanna elaborate on the brand-newgrindiness. Does mandatory grinding create an unbalance of sorts in thelevelling-up dynamic, as one could rightfully fear? Well, not quite: with themandatory grinding factored in, you’ll reach the same levels as in old games bythe end of a run. Even the levelling rate is preserved: fast-levelling ‘Mons doreap more benefit from levelling Candies than slow-levelling ones, making theformer stronger by the end of a run. Old games had you reach high levelsthrough fighting everything in your way; S&S, on the other hand,does so through grinding and farming. Is it better or worse? It’s up to every Pokefanto answer that, I guess. My only pet peeve is the fact that Route Trainers arenow way too weak compared to wild ‘Mons; but that’s only a minor balance issue that can easily be fixed in next games.  Interestingly,whilst I love Galar to pieces, I cannot occult the fact that it robbed me ofthe thrill of rushing breathlessly through a region and seeing my One and Monlybecome a powerhouse as I did so. That has always been my main pleasure in Pokemonsolo running; and with mandatory grinding and farming stops and Trainers beingsuch pushovers, that sweet bulldozing rush is now gone. However, S&Streated me to something really sweet in exchange: the thrill of grinding andfarming into oblivion, and seeing my One and Monly literally gain 30 levels intwo minutes — and my, that isn’t abad trade at all.    Icould probably go on more; but as I’ll have many more occasions to probe Galarand expand on it in exquisite detail in future run reports, I’ll take French leavefor now. In more ways than one, actually — but more on that soon. If my burning passion for S&S made you itch to play thepair, or love it even more if it was your jam already, then I’ll consider mywork done indeed. Take care of yourselves, dear fellowgamers; and keep playing through thick and thin! You can find the rest of the report here:Part 1: The Most RPG-ish Pokemon Game of Them AllPart 2: Say Goodbye to the TropesPart 3: My Own Private Pros & Cons"},
{"title": "The Pokemon Sword & Shield Report, Part 3: My own private Pros & Cons", "date": "31/07/2021", "text": "The title says it all, really; I’m here to list the (many) things Ilove to pieces in S&S, and the (very few) things I don’t quitefancy. Without further ado, my dear fellow Pokefans, let’s get to it! The Pros: Hop. Man, I lovethat chap, like the little brother I never had. The relationship between Hopand your Trainer is simply the deepest and most touching relationship in thewhole series — heck, Hau and Lillie wish they could be just as close to yourTrainer. I spy with my little eye, something beginning with S- all over theinternet — some serious shipping, with Gloria and Victor. That mosttouching and fulfilling relationship is woven into the story through the Two Heroesof Galar theme, which could have been a bit stifling; fortunately, the build-upis really slow and careful, and Hop is not forced on you like Lillie was in S&M.Also, take some time to scrutinize his facial expressions at the end of hisfinal fight with you: they’re so subtle, so nuanced, so deep and haunting thatit hurts. Strategically, the guy is dope. He doesn’t just engage you overand over again with stronger versions of his ‘Mons, like all rivals before him.He revamps and tweaks his team constantly, going as far as to fight you with a completelynew team at some point. Yet when all is said and done, Hopand your Trainer are a perfect combination of Brains & Brawl, asacknowledged by the ultimate morphing into a Champion and Pokemon Professorduo. That’s some seriously good character development there, and it goes muchdeeper than your usual Pokemon rivalvry.  The Galar League. They lookawesome, both as a team and separately. I’ve never really paid attentionto Gym leaders before: the only one that ever stuck in my mind is Olivia from S&M,and that was more due to her skimpy outfit than to her personality. But man, Iwon’t forget the Galar Gym Leaders any time soon: from their designs to theirpersonalities and attitudes, everything about them is memorable — and mesmerizing.  Gyms Leader Fights. The GalarLeague is awesome enough already; but boy oh boy, do fights against them ooze effortlesscool and badasseness. I’ll say it: those fights riled me up like no other GymLeader fights in the series. I lapped up everything about them, from the sleekand smooth camera angles and moves to the impossibly bouncy and stimulating GymLeader theme track.  Raihan — a.k.a. S&S’sresident slut, and the hunkiest, sexiest, hottest character to ever grace a Pokemongame. Not only is the Dragon Trainer the first ever Wake-up Call Boss in thewhole series, but he’s also the first character to ooze genuine sultriness andallure through every pore. Raihan, baby, what did you do to me? I’ve not beenfanboying like that over a cool and strong character since Trunksin DBZ, hot damn. And heck, I’m not the only one: try googling “Raihanis…”, and the first suggestion that pops up is “Raihan is hot” — true story. Notonly that, but the internet is swarming with fan art showing the residentDragon Trainer in various stages of undress, as well as pairing him withbasically everybody in Galar — from Kabu to Nessa to Milo, without forgettingVictor&Gloria, Piers and, of course, Leon himself. Oh yeah, right:there’s a wild theory floating around the internet about the latter and Raihan,a theory that claims that the two are canonically rivals and boyfriends.Long story short: Raihan is hawt indeed, and the whole Universe wants toget into his shorts — heck, even yours truly wouldn’t be quite against it. The whole cast of main characters. They’re all delightfully unique and incredibly well fleshed out,with very distinct and nuanced personalities. Cherry on the cake, they’ve allbeen granted their own exclusive battle theme — and boy, do these songs fit them to a T indeed,from the giddy trepidation of Hop’s theme to the vicious restlessness of Bede’stheme (big up for Marnie’s theme, which can worm its way into your head fasterthan a Europop track). I have to give a special mention to the many differentways that crew throws their Pokeballs, which is always consistent with theirpersonalities on top of being riveting to watch. I’ll say it: this isabsolutely my favourite cast of characters ever in a Pokemongame. And baby, the internet agrees: S&S shipping is all over theplace, with crazy good fan art and heaps of fanfictions. The Pokemon designs. Look,some of them are my favourites in the entire series. Morpeko? BestPikachu clone evah, cuter even than its venerable model. Centiskorch?The coolest and most badass Bug ‘Mon ever created. Carkoal? The creature’ssnarky smile is irresistible, and its design fits the England theme soperfectly that it hurts. Alcremie? Everything Slurpuff wishes it couldhave been. Dragapult? Impossibly hilarious and kickass at the same time. Andmy, the local forms! Alolan forms were a nice try already, but Galar honed theconcept to perfection. Sirfetch’d? So Arthurian! Galarian Weezing? SoIndustrial Revolution! Galarian Slowbro? So New Wave! Galarian Ponyta? So Goldfrapp-meets-EpsomDerby! I could go on and on, but you get the picture: I absolutely adoreGalar’s fauna, and I’m itching to cruise with nearly all of them. The Cons: Leon’s style — or lack thereof.What were you thinking, GameFreak? Look, I’m a mullet lover, and youknow from my Sun&Moon run reports that my sense of style is acomplete insult to la mode; but heck, even I cannot swallow Leon’sstyle. He looks ridiculous, period. No skip feature for cutscenes. Skipping movies is not nearly enough; I wish I could have skippedall narrative parts. Please GameFreak, make this come true in the Gen IVremakes. Dynamax. Let’s face it,it’s a bit repetitive, and not nearly as interesting as ME. It doesn’t helpthat Trainers always Dynamax their very last ‘Mon, killing any surprise elementin the process. Granted, Dynamax probably offer more strategic depth when youplay with a full team and have to choose carefully which ‘Mon to Dynamax; but ina solo setting, it’s only a matter of choosing when to Dynamax your loneranger. I’ll admit it: it got me out of a bind a couple of times, as IDynamaxed early in the fight to get rid of some troublesome opposition; andheck, Dynamax can really put on a show when you turn on the battle animations.  Spikemuth. I dig theStreets of Rage-inspired layout and the place’s hair metal-meets-punk infusedatmosphere; but why on earth can’t I enter houses there, just like in anyother bloody town in the game? I understand what GameFreak wanted to dohere, the way they tried to create a low-fi, gritty vibe — and totallysucceeded; but gosh, Spikemuth should have been just a little livelier and morefleshed out. As it is now, it feels like it’s been added as an afterthough,which is just a pity.  I’m sure you can feel my burning passion for Galar now, dearfellow gamers; not only do I have way more pros than cons, but I managed tofind some good even in my cons. You might think that after three posts, I’veraved about Galar enough already; but nope, I haven’t got my fill yet. Thereare still some things I wanna say; and I’m gonna say them in the fourth and last part of my S&S report. See ya there! You can find the rest of the report here:Part 1: The Most RPG-ish Pokemon Game of Them AllPart 2: Say Goodbye to the TropesPart 4: The Ultimate Overview"},
{"title": "Aqua Kitty UDX: It’s a sure shot, honey", "date": "11/07/2021", "text": "Dreadnought Mode nearly done and dusted, baby! There’s only thegigantic and uber-hard final level left before I can claim full mastery of thething, and let me tell you: I’m gonna take all the time I need to clear thatone level, just like I did with its predecessors.   Man, what a crazy ride that was. Levels went from straightforward toincreasingly mazey, with a pitch-perfect difficulty curve; I could really feelmyself getting stronger, faster and better. I swear my visual acuity and visionfield genuinely increased, just like my reaction speed: I now feel likeI have eyes everywhere, and I can effortlessly dodge shots that would have foundme defenceless three weeks ago. Also, I see AKUDX laser beams when Iclose my eyes, which is a surefire sign that the game is totally ingrained inme mind — and alsothat I play it way too much for my own good. But who cares, when it’s so darn fun?   AKUDX only got better asstages rolled, with the three last ones being my favourites. Not only are theydelightfully complex and challenging, but they sport what I deem the best trackin the whole game — a.k.a. Roll Tide. Man, I fell hard for that track the first time Ilistened to it. It boasts this loopy, slightly obsessive quality I fancy in myvideogame music; and each phrase adds something subtle to the mix while leavingthe piece’s essence untouched. But the best comes at the end: after a bridge ofsorts that builds up a sense of anticipation, the track suddenly shifts gears at3:25 and turns into a Jan Hammer-esque synth coda that would totally feel athome in a Miami Vice episode. I didn’t see it coming at all, and my jaw dropped and my heart swelled a little when I heard it for the firsttime. When I play the last levels, I always try to stay alive until that coda;once I’ve heard it, I can die happy. Like, literally.      Heck, even the regular Aqua Kitty gameplay got better thanks to myDreadnought adventure. I now rush and glide effortlessly through the shallowwaters of the original mode, shooting at everything with abandon. Honestly,EastAsiaSoft: just shut up, release a physical version and take my moneyalready. I probably won’t write a final post once I’ve beaten the last level,because everything is pretty much said; on the other hand, I’m very muchinclined to write a ‘Tips and Tricks’ post — for myself as much as for the next shmup noob.See ya soon, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "The Pokemon Sword & Shield Report, Part 2: Say goodbye to the tropes", "date": "27/06/2021", "text": "Let’s face it, dear fellow Pokefans: although we love the seriesdearly, we’ve all wished GameFreak could ditch a couple of Pokemontropes along the way. Well, guess what: they finally obliged, and harder thanwe’d ever thought they would. As the saying goes: be careful what you wish for,you might just get it — heck, some of us Pokefans will definitely get more trope ditching than we’ve bargained for. Brace yourself, for here comes the ominously long andmeaty list of all the tropes we have to bid adieu.  The Rival. We maytry to convince ourselves otherwise, by claiming that the Rival role is splitbetween four characters in S&S, or that Leon was our true rival allalong. Yet at some point, we’ll have to man up and face the truth: namely thatthe Rival as we know it, all riling up and antagonizing and taking our veryexistence as a personal insult, is now a thing of Gens past. Sure enough, thereare people we fight on a regular basis; however, it takes more than repeatedfights to make a Pokemon Rival. Rivals were our frenemies, frustratedlittle b*tches who branded us as the roadblock standing in their way togreatness and wanted to make us pay for it at every turn; and no matter howhard we look, we won’t find that in S&S. We may find bits and piecesof past Rivals here and there — like, Bede’s snarky and overconfident streak screams good old Blue,Marnie’s standoffish and aloof attitude emulates May and Calem, and Hop’szestiness and bounciness are more than a little close to Barry’s. And ofcourse, you have the deep, intense thing going on between Raihan andLeon, which is definitely a reboot of the burning Red and Blue rivalry. Ifanything, the Leon/Raihan dynamic proves that GameFreak didn’t forget how to dorivalry over the years, and that not giving us our own personal Rival in S&S was very much a conscious choice.    The Villain Team. Thattrope had been shaken a bit already in Gen VII, where we had a Villain Teamposing as good guys as well as a laughing stock parodic Villain Team; but thistime around, it’s really dead and buried. Team Yell introduce themselves rightaway as a bunch of Marnie supporters, whose only flaw is their overzealousness;as for Macro Cosmos, they oppose you only once in the game, and over amisunderstanding of sorts to boot. No Villain Team means no Big Baddie; andindeed, you’d be hard-pressed to find such a thing in S&S. Sure, Oleana iskinda shady, and Rose is more than a little ambiguous; but neither one of themboasts openly and actively nefarious intentions like Villain Team Leaders ofGens past.  The Pokemon Professor.Yes, there is a Pokemon Professor in S&S; however, there’s nodenying that Professor Magnolia is here just to pay lip service to the trope.You meet her twice over the course of your adventure, and she has no influencewhatsoever on your endeavours beyond crafting your Dynamax Bracelet andconvincing Leon to endorse you for the Champion Cup. Not only that, but shepasses the baton to Sonia before the end of the game; and as Hop himselfexpresses an interest in becoming a Pokemon Professor, we can safely claim thatthe cliché of the Pokemon Professor who rules over a single region yet enrolsteenagers to gather data for him is no longer a thing indeed. It says a lotthat the Pokedex is explicitly given to you for your own enlightenment, withthe Champion Cup in sight, rather than to play lackey to a lazy PokemonProfessor.   The Hall ofFame. If you thought the absence of celebratory Hall of Fame pictures inmy S&S run reports were an oversight on my part, you’re wrong indeed;those pictures are missing because there is simply no Hall of Fame in Galar.The game closes on a picture of Leon acknowledging his defeat by throwing awayhis cap; and if you leave the Switch untouched for long enough after thecredits are done rolling, you’ll be treated to a view of your Trainer and histeam standing proudly on the pitch. But apart from that, there is no glitzycelebration of your victory, no record of your exploits, no rubbing of your egolike in previous Gens. It feels weird indeed; but I’d wager I’ll get used to itover time and runs.  The HMs. You might saythat no more HMs was a thing in Gen VII already, and you’d be totally right;but Gen VIII takes things further, by removing nearly all HM-related obstructions.No more bushes to Cut, boulders to Rock Smash or Strength away, or darkness toFlash — let thatsink in. As for Flying and Surfing, they’re handled respectively by a loadingscreen and a Bike upgrade. Cruising around a region has never been smoother andeasier; and to cement that Rubicon crossing that’s hopefully bound to stay, allformer HMs have been turned into TMs.  The Move Deleter,Move Reminder and Name Rater. No morerunning around the region to find those guys: all that deleting, reminding andrenaming business can be safely and conveniently handled at the next PokemonCentre. Thank Arceus for that, as it allows one to experiment more freely withMoves and change their ‘Mons’ names in every town if they wish to.  The “OMG Whata Surprise!” Champion. The game tells us, right away andin no uncertain terms, who the resident Champion is. I’ll admit it: theincognito Champion trope in so ingrained in my mind that I first assumed thatthe game would go all plot-twisty on us, and that Leon would turn out notto be the genuine Champion after all. But nope; he was the one and onlyChampion alright, and all guessing games were pointless.  Return. I had to saygoodbye to that beloved fixture of my solo endeavours; however, Return is butthe tip of the iceberg when it comes to Moves that got axed from Gen VIII. Wehave to part with no less than 77 Moves in S&S. Seventy-sevenfriggin’ Moves — let that sink in. The complete list can be found here, and itincludes venerable entries such as Hidden Power, Pursuit and Embargo.   Let’s face it, dear fellow Pokefans: we’ve been ushered in a new Pokemonera, for better or for worse. The fact that I, for one, love Galar and S&Sshould be obvious enough by now; but I’m pretty sure I can make it even moreobvious by writing a lively, meaty list of my very own Pros&Cons. And thusI’ll see you soon with the third part of my S&S report, dear fellowgamers; in the meantime, keep playing and take care! You can find the rest of the report here:Part 1: The Most RPG-ish Pokemon Game of Them AllPart 3: My Own Private Pros & ConsPart 4: The Ultimate Overview"},
{"title": "Mary Skelter 2: Yes, but not really", "date": "20/06/2021", "text": "We’re talking about a super-elusive game here; a game which, unlikeits prequel and upcoming sequel, was not granted a wide physical release on ourshores. That game happens to belong to one of my favourite subgenres under theRPG sun, which should have warranted an immediate and brainless purchase… Andwould have, if not for the fact that this same game’s price tag ranges from 125to 350 bucks on Ebay for the Limited Run physical edition — shipping notincluded, b*tch. Even a serial collector like me had to balk at purchasing such anexpensive game. Not just an expensive game, mind you; an expensive gamesandwiched between two much more affordable entries. And so, I settled for thenext best thing: to purchase MS2 digitally, and to try it right away tosee if it was worth the investment.   As you guessed already, the answer after a couple of hours of play is notquite: I won’t pounce to grab a copy of MS2 on Ebay, neither now norever. Heck, I’m not even sure I’ll ever play the thing beyond that firstforay, which I actually cut short — a first for a FPDC. The reason is pretty simple:although MS2 sports some perfectly decent FPDC mechanics, it grossesme out. The yucky factor is strong with that game: from the foul colours ofthe dungeons to the vile fuzziness of the graphics, the whole thing screamsdecay and gloominess. And when you add the grotesque aesthetics, the bodyhorror elements in the story, the (heavily censored but still kinda disgusting) blood-splattering gimmick in combat, the repulsive SFX, thediscordant soundtrack and the stressful pursuit by foes, you get a game that Idon’t quite fancy playing. If I fancied being stressed or nauseated by a game,I would play survival horror, thank you very much. Long story short: MS2 and I are not meant together, I’m afraid.I won’t go as far as to erase it now that it’s on a memory card; but I’mhonestly not sure I’ll ever feel like playing it again. Also, I’ll check thelevel of grossness carefully before committing to a purchase of Mary SkelterFinale. See ya soon, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "The Pokemon Sword & Shield Report, Part 1: The most RPG-ish Pokemon game of them all", "date": "15/06/2021", "text": "When I first played S&S back in January 2020, I couldn’timmediately write about it. I remember being completely disoriented by thatfirst brush with Gen VIII: Sword felt sorta foreign to me, yet italso felt kinda familiar. How was that even possible? One year and a couple ofruns later, I finally nailed down the reason, and it’s encapsulated in thisvery post’s title: of all the series’ entries, S&S are the closestthing to a regular RPG and the farthest thing to a true-blue Pokemongame. A bit of elaboration is in order. Technically, Pokemon games areRPGs, and I’m fully aware of that; yet, they always sported their very own setof tropes, while leaving other long-running RPG tropes completely untouched. Butlo and behold, S&S finally embraced the latter, and incorporated RPGtropes that have been around forever yet never made it into a Pokemongame before that — hence that nagging feeling of mixed familiarity and strangeness I gotfrom my first run. Without further ado, here are the tropes in question: Boss Rush. Althoughthe Elite Four showdown has a slight Boss Rush quality, it was never atrue-blue Boss Rush. For once, there were simply not enough bosses; foranother, they were all brand-new foes. This time around, we have no less thansix opponents we’ve fought before, coming at us with revamped and strongerteams. Now that’s a real Boss Rush; and if you fancy adding the fightsagainst Oleana, Rose, all the Macro Cosmos Grunts and Eternatus that you alsohave to tackle before you engage Leon himself, you totally get the grindiestfinal stretch you’ve ever fought in a Pokemon game. Mandatory Level-Grinding. I’veplayed three runs of Sword already, and I needed to level-grind in everysingle one of them. You know what they say: once is happenstance, twice iscoincidence, and three times is definitely friggin’ mandatory grinding. The momentI needed to grind was different every time, but it always happened. I cannotstress enough how much of a departure this is: never before have a Pokemongame forced grinding on me so consistently. And if I have to grind in a solosetting, then I’d wager everybody has to grind in S&S indeed.  Wake-Up Call Boss. Therewere never such bosses in Pokemon games; just Gym Leaders that were more orless challenging, depending on your team’s make-up. But this time, there’s nogetting around it: it’s pretty obvious that Raihan was designed to be acomplete b*tch and a giant thorn in everyone’s side. As master Yodasaid: you will falter against him — and if you don’t do so during the first fight,you’ll do so during the pre-Leon reprise. Not only does the guy have a fullteam of overpowered Dragon ‘Mons at his beck and call, but he’s bringing the infamousGen V Weather Wars back with a vengeance. Let me tell you: never before have I struggledso consistently against a Dragon Trainer in a Pokemon game — heck, I used tohandle Dragon Gym Leaders so effortlessly that I always wondered what the fussabout Dragon ‘Mons was about. Well, now I get it — painfully. Grinding Patches. I knowwhat you’re thinking there: Wild Area! And true enough, the Wild Area is indeeda giant grinding patch — or more like a grinding field at that point. But the Grinding Patchtheme runs a bit deeper than that. For the first time ever in the series, wild‘Mons are routinely stronger than Trainers’ ‘Mons, which totally screams‘grinding fodder’. Also, look closely and fight often on Routes, and you’llundoubtedly find at least one spot teeming with wild ‘Mons that are perfectly weakagainst your team leader. Route 7 hosted both my Cinderace’s and Inteleon’sprivate grinding patches, while the entirety of Route 9 was my Rillaboom’splayground.  Exit Dungeon Spell. Hey,that’s a minor thing, but it’s still an RPG trope, ain’t it? No more disposableEscape Ropes, baby — Galar is recycling-friendly! You get one single Escape Rope, that canbe reused to your heart’s content. I never though reusable Escape Rope shouldbe a thing in Pokemon games; but now that I have it, I’m quite contentwith it indeed. Exploration Thrill. This isless of a trope and more of a running theme in regular RPGs; and for the firsttime ever, it’s also a thing in Pokemon. Exploring every nook and crannyof the Wild Area, the Isle of Armor and the Crown Tundra is a most delightfulactivity indeed, and I’ve been pouring more hours than I thought I would insaid activity. But apart from the actual exploration, S&S also havea way of kindling wanderlust in a gamer’s heart. Something in Galar’s distantviews and open, faraway horizons makes me wanna step out of bound and discoverthose places. That’s my good old gaming fernweh coming back full forcefor you; I’ve not felt that way, that strongly, for a very long time — let alone in a Pokemongame, of all places. The only instance of gaming fernweh in the entireseries took place in Explorers of Sky, and it was mild compared to theway I feel about Galar. Man, I’m lusting hard after those Galarianvistas; and I feel a sweet, wondrous ache every time a bush or a fence stops medead in my tracks.  Now, should we be delighted or miffed that Pokemon is moreclassic RPG than ever? That’s most definitely everyone’s call; as for me, I’mmighty fine with that evolution. This is certainly the most major departurewe’ve ever seen in the series; this time around, no one can blame GameFreak forbeing allergic to change. And mind you, the changes go even deeper than beingmore RPG; S&S is also decidedly less Pokemon, as we’ll see inthe second part of my report. Until then, dear fellow gamers, keep playing andtake care!  You can find the rest of the report here: Part 2: Say Goodbye to the TropesPart 3: My Own Private Pros & ConsPart 4: The Ultimate Overview"},
{"title": "Aqua Kitty UDX: Here we go again", "date": "05/06/2021", "text": "Well, well; what do we have here? Me buying a game I swore off acouple of years ago, that’s what — and buying it freakin’ digital to boot! Now, didI change my mind and finally realise Aqua Kitty’s awesomeness after allthese years? Nope, not quite. What happened is that I stumbled upon an AstroAqua Kitty track on Youtube, liked what I heard, and immediately proceededto purchase the whole soundtrack on Bandcamp. There, I was given the opportunityto purchase an Electric Café package, and gladly accepted — all the moregreedily as I spotted four brand-new Aqua Kitty tracks. I listened tothem, was utterly blown away (more on that later), and decided that I couldn’tlive another day without shooting with abandon to the beat of these sonic gems — and the rest is history, and me scurrying to the Nintendo eShop topurchase AKUDX. A couple of shooting sessions later, I regret nothing. I came for themusic, yet ended up staying for the gameplay, a million times over. Not justany gameplay, mind you: the brand-new Dreadnought Mode. Look, I’ll bare myheart here: Dreadnought Mode is the sh*t. Had it been includedin the original Vita version of Aqua Kitty, I’d have purchased theLimited Run physical edition in a freakin’ heartbeat. And you can betyour sweet life that if any publisher releases a physical version of AKUDX,I’ll get my greedy paws on it faster than you can say meow. The Dreadnought Mode basically gives me everything I wanted,yet didn’t get, from the original AK. It gives me epic dashes throughtreacherous waters infested with milling masses of foes, it gives menerve-wracking yet deliciously challenging boss battles, it gives me a palpablesense of progress and, last but not least, it gives me the much-needed andhighly enjoyable possibility to strategize and shoot it my way. TheDreadnought Mode could actually pass as an entirely different shooter from therest of the game — a much deeper, layered and challenging shooter. It’s basically agiant boss rush — think Monster Hunter meetsLevel 2-3 from Super Mario Land, with a whiff of Titan Souls.It’s a super-addictive mix, and one I fancy much more than the regular AKgameplay. Long story short: I totally dig the Dreadnought Mode, from theoverall gameplay to the quirkiest details. Like, I always wiggle with joy when me eyes catch the wonderfully sweet name of ‘Meowiana’ in the mode’s pitch, and Ialways shiver with delight when hearing the deliciously threatening sound ofthe core activation. I burst out laughing upon discovering one of the dreadnoughts was called friggin' Fissionchips — heck, I'm still giggling a bit writing it. The grateful mreow of the freed kitties is aslovely as before, and the soundtrack is better than ever. What more can a shmup lover ask for? Well, how about a juicy physical edition sporting both Aqua KittyUDX and Astro Aqua Kitty? I would buy it in a millisecond, I swear. (Edit: Limited Run Games did release that juicy physical edition, and I did buy it in a millisecond ^^) And now, on to the next shot!"},
{"title": "Arc of Alchemist: It’s a true love story", "date": "28/05/2021", "text": "I’m done with AoA after 15 lovely hours, and let me tell you: Ilove this game more than I ever thought I would — or could. See, it’s all about unmet expectationsand getting more than I bargained for — in the most delightful and delicious way. Upon reading reviews, and knowing Compile Heart’s record, I bracedmyself for a minor game with cute aesthetics; something in the vein of Stella Glow, with tiny environments, anime-ish storytelling and an endearingbudget quality. What I got instead was a wonderfully evocative andbreathtakingly atmospheric journey of discovery and wonderment that feltchallenging and comforting, epic and homely at once. AoA’s scope is muchwider than I expected at first, and its production values much, muchbetter. It feels like no other game I’ve played, and yet it sports plenty offamiliar elements from games past. But the bottom line is that AoA tookme faraway, away from my Switch and my daily routine, and offered me anexperience of escapism and reverie that only videogames can provide.  Although AoA sports a fair bit of hack-and-slashy goodness,it’s really, at its core, a game about exploration. It nearly qualifiesas a running simulator of sorts, in which racing through open areas whiledrinking in your surroundings is part and parcel of the experience. The map,which auto-fills as you progress à la Xenoblade, only enhances thedesire to explore — heck, I have to confess that I didn’t leave a single cornerunrevealed, and that it felt mightily satisfying. Soaking in the atmosphere isalso a must, all the more so as the progression in that department is epicallysweet. From the warm softness of the golden sands to the achingmelancholy of the star-studded desert night, from the sweet loneliness ofthe green-bathed plateaus to the haunting emptiness of the desertedcomplex, you’re in for a stunning journey through landscapes & feels.  For the record, I played with the default party of Quinn, Axel andMicah until the end. They rocked together, so I didn’t feel the need to changeanything; but I’ll gladly experiment with other combinations when I replay thegame. I developed my base a reasonable amount — enough, at any rate, to get my paws on the lethalJuggernaut weapons and the gorgeous Elite uniforms. Last but certainly notleast, I really dug the story’s twists and turns (SPOILERS!), fromGareth’s untimely death to the plot-twisty reveal that the crew are children ofthe Moon, all the way until Quinn’s meaningful sacrifice and days ofloneliness, before a heart-warming reunion years later (True Ending all theway!). (END OF SPOILERS)  When all is said and done, I honestly cannot fathom how AoAgot such a low aggregate score. 36 should be given to a game that’s completelybroken and/or a total offense to gaming, which AoA is certainly not. Iknow I won’t single-handedly turn the tides for that most maligned CompileHeart offering; but if I can at least deliver a positive, tried-and-tested viewon it, then I’ll consider my job done. I’ll see you soon with fresh gaminggoodness, dear fellow gamers; until then, keep gaming and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sword: The Boltund Solo Run", "date": "23/05/2021", "text": "I said I was going to stop playing S&S after my StartersRuns — well,guess what? I lied! Or not exactly, actually. I was totally planning to let thegames rest, until my gaming instinct was stirred by a completely unrelatedevent. See, I was listening to some Lana Del Rey; and as the chorus of ‘BodyElectric’ shimmied in my ears, a though struck me like a lightning bolt fromthe blue (ooh yes indeed): I had to tackle a solo run with a Boltund,and I had to call the creature Body Electric. And I had to do allof that no later than immediately, because that flight of fancy just wouldn’tleave my brain. What’s a gamer to do but listen to the gaming instinct,hey? My BodyElectric turned out to be that lone Yamper that pops upin the middle of Route 2. It’s a non-respawning Wanderer, which made it uniqueand precious; and it became even more precious to me when I discovered that itwas blessed with a Brave Nature. Now that’s the perfect hook to start ravingabout Boltund’s stats, which are some of the most friggin’ perfect I’veever seen. Tell me of another ‘Mon that boast sky-high Attack and Sp.Attack, paired with even higher Speed and perfectly serviceabledefensive stats and HP? Boltund might seriously be one of the most well-rounded‘Mons when it comes to stats, with great assets and no crippling weakness.  And the electric canine’s assets don’t stop there, ooh no precious. Wehave to talk about them Moves — because holy moly, is Boltund well-endowed inthat department indeed. When I saw BodyElectric learn Bite and Crunch upongaining levels, I was afraid Boltund would be the canine version of Luxray,namely a would-be Electric/Dark ‘Mon with the design to match; however, myfears blessingly dissipated as I discovered the full extent of the dog’slearnset. On top of a crap ton of Electric Moves, Boltund has access to Fire,Fairy, Ground and Psychic offensive Moves. Granted, we’re talking about asingle Move in each one of these extra Types; still, that’s more than enough toput together a kickass Move pool with intense coverage. After a bit of fooling around with Swift, Façade and Spark, Iproceeded to assemble said kickass Move pool. BodyElectric knew Crunch and PlayRough already, and I wanted to get my greedy paws on Psychic Fangs and ElectroBall. I favoured the latter over Wild Charge for obvious reasons: not onlywould Electroball spare me the recoil damage, but with Boltund’s Speed beingthrough the roof, I was assured to wreak havoc on the battlefield. A couple ofDynamax Raids yielded those much-wanted TRs, along with Hyper Voice as a bonus.I hadn’t planned on getting a Normal Move; but I reasoned that wielding aSpecial Move maybe wasn’t so bad, especially a Move with 90 Power. When all wassaid and learnt, my whole Move pool boasted 85-and-beyond Power — which, let’s faceit, is truly dazzling for an Electric ‘Mon.  Actually, Boltund as a whole is dazzling. Heck, it’s electrifying,that’s what it is! I know that’s a super-easy pun to make — butheck, it’s friggin’ true. Boltund is simply one ofthe best Electric ‘Mons ever created, if not the absolute best. It mademe fall in love with the Electric Type even more — and mind you, I loved that Type a helluva lotalready. (Now that I think of it, I should totally write a post about myTop 5 Favourite Types one of these days.) That run was pure pleasure frombeginning to end, and I’m glad to part with S&S on such a high note — again. I’ll see you soon with fresh gaming goodness, dearfellow gamers; in the meantime, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Arc of Alchemist: The Gargantuan Killer Battle Report", "date": "16/05/2021", "text": "As adejected reviewer rightly pointed out, each and every boss in AoA is aMont Blanc-sized difficulty spike, and a Wake-Up Call Boss in and out ofitself. Now, why zero in on the Gargantuan Killer? Well, although Imay well craft a full Boss Eradication feature one of these days, I have tostart with GK and expand on that fight. Not only was the progressive way I figuredout how to beat that boss deeply satisfying, but the stages I went throughperfectly matched that whole pattern of wonderment and discovery I have goingon with AoA.   Stage1: Okay, now I’m quitting When Ifaced GK for the first time, it took exactly five seconds for my wholeteam to kick the bucket, leaving me gaping at the screen and trying tounderstand what the heck just happened. I went at it again a couple oftimes, and finally managed to understand how fights unrolled. GK shoots uberpowerful long-range laser beams at me, whilst a hive of minor foes fire blastershots in every direction — all this while puffs of icy air are hanging aroundthe place and eating away at my team’s HP. A tough predicament all right, that! So tough,actually, that I seriously thought of quitting. I had already entertained suchthoughts upon facing the preceding boss, the Laser Tank; but it was much strongerthis time, as the apparent gap between my team and GK was much, much wider.But then, forgotten feelings from my younger gaming years awoke: a mix ofpowerlessness, puzzlement and excitement, giving way to an intense desire tobeat the crap out of that seemingly indestructible pest of a boss. In anutshell, I was riled up, and I vowed to eradicate GK if that was the lastthing I did. Stage2: Let’s grind, shall we? My firststrategy was simple, and very true to myself: to grind, folks. It had workednicely with Laser Tank: whilst I struggled at first, a couple of extra levelsallowed me to beat the thing comfortably. I proceeded to use the same trick,and grinded until my whole team was Lv. 60.  I’d liketo claim that it made all the difference in the world; but the harsh truth isthat it didn’t change jack sh*t. My team was sent packing just as fastat Lv. 60 than at Lv. 50, leaving me thinking that a couple of extra levelsweren’t going to do the trick this time. I’d probably need to grind 20 to 30more levels before being able to resist GK’s deadly attacks — and heck, even myserial grinder’s mind balked at the thought. Those 10 levels were alreadytedious enough to gain, with areas being so wide and foes not respawning;racking up 30 more levels would totally have terminated my love story with AoA. Stage3: Broadening my strategies If levelsweren’t enough, I had to find ways to alleviate all the issues I had with thatfight. First was that darn cold air that sapped my HP; surely there was away to get rid of that annoyance, right? I had already spotted another area inthe Abyssal Valley sporting those same puffs of cold air, and I decided to experimentthere. A survey of the place revealed suspicious-looking structures that lookedlike empty braziers; I Lunageared them with the Fire Orb, and bingo! The coldair was suddenly gone, leaving my HP bar in peace. I had spotted the samebrazier-like contraptions at the boss arena; and so, the cold air issue wasvirtually solved.  Thesecond issue was GK’s cursed long-range laser beam, which was a sure-fire fightender. I reasoned that the best course of action was to stay mobile at alltimes, and to stop solely to unleash Fire Lunagear shots (GK’s elementalweakness) and special attacks before dashing again. Then, I would have to makedo with my healing items, and try to stay alive long enough for my item use andspecial attack gauges to refill.   Stage4: The money shot Armed with that newfound understanding of GK’s showdown, I went at itagain. I first dashed at the braziers and Lunageared them, before turning myattention to GK. As one fateful dodge brought me literally at its feet, Idiscovered something mightily unexpected: its shooting range didn’t include its own personal space. Its laser didn’t bend towards the ground beyond a 45-degreeangle, which meant that I was totally safe as long as I stayed glued to it. Acouple of Fire Orb shots and combos later, GK was no more, leaving me free toreach the next area at long last. Mind you, that fight was still no walk in thepark: my crew survived with a mere quarter of their HP bars, and I hurriedlyretreated to the base to heal and save my hard-earned progress.  I just love how utterly clever and logical that whole setting was. Itmakes perfect sense that a laser beam should have limited firing angles, andone should be able to reason that a foe that rock at long-range attacks has tobe less competent at melee. Yet at the same time, the fight is set in away that makes you want to stay as far from GK as possible. No matter howprepared you are, you will be obliterated in a matter of seconds uponentering the arena for the first time; that will instantly cast GK as aformidable and deadly foe that you certainly don’t want to get up close andpersonal with. Approaching GK enough to realise his glaring range shortcomingsis either a matter of trying any tactic you can think of, or a matter of pureserendipity; and yet, once you’ve done so, you realise that said shortcomingswere totally predictable all along.  It’s been a long time since an RPG boss fight has been such arollercoaster of emotions — from the initial daze and near-despair to the riling-up and plotting,up until the intense relief and satisfaction of victory. This is thetrue essence of an RPG boss fight: to stumble, to be challenged, to despair abit, and to rack your brain and switch tactics until you finally emergevictorious. Now, I’d lie if I said I wanted every single RPG boss to deliverthat kind of hardcore experience; but to get it once in a while is mighty fineby me. I sure didn’t expect AoA, of all games, to feature such a fight;and I can only hope that the game will surprise me more before I’m done withit. Until I come back with more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers, keepplaying and take care!"},
{"title": "Random Gaming Thoughts", "date": "09/05/2021", "text": "Hullo, dear fellow gamers! Hope you’re doing mighty fine, and gaminglike it’s going out of fashion. I feel like rambling a bit about this, that andother gaming matters today; and I’ll start with no less than a first debrief ofmy now tried-and-tested OWOG system.  According to plan, I should have played 18 games already. Did I?Nope, not even close! The OWOG system is not at fault there, though. Theculprit that makes my gaming schedule derail on a regular basis is none other thanmy darn real life, which leaves little to no time or energy for gamingthese days. Whole days pass without me getting the opportunity to lay my thumbon a D-Pad, when it’s not a full darn week. I’m mightily miffed, all themore so as when I can pull off the OWOG system, it works like a charmand feels really fulfilling. However, I don’t fret too much over this: my busyIRL schedule is purely circumstantial, and not bound to last on the long run.It sure overstayed its welcome already; still, things will cooldown after some time, and then I’ll be able to indulge more in sweet, sweetgaming. So hot, so hot, you're on my radar ♥I cannot game as much as I’d like these days, but I can sure buy asmany games as I want. And oh boy, do I have games to covet and get my paws onindeed: the first half of 2021 was littered with appetizing releases, andmore yummy titles are piling up all the way to the end of the year. And ofcourse, I have to welcome the brand-new dark blue Switch Lite in my preciouscollection sooner or later — unless I keep it as 2021’s Official Christmas Gift from my lil’sister, of course. But wait! Maybe Ninty will deliver a limited edition Switch Lite along Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl — and my, wouldn't that be the perfect gift. And yep I notice you, you're on my radar too ♥Let's move on to these upcoming GenIV remakes, whose names alone make me drool with anticipation. I vowed to neveragain take part in heated internet gaming debates after beingforced to eat a big piece of humble pie upon playing (and loving) Let’s GoEevee, and I’ll keep that oath. Suffice it to say that I’m extremelyhyped about these games indeed, and impervious to the controversy surrounding them. So the art style is deemed too primitive for Gen VIII entries? Please b*tch, no art style is too primitive for a gamer who started their career in 1990. My last Diamond&Pearl fix was two years ago already, and it will be pure joy to dive into revamped versions of the pair. Heck, I'm even itching to be reunited with my little chap Barry, and to see if Vintage 2021 Barry is as excitable as Vintage 2006 Barry. My sole worry lies in the factthat these remakes are being handled by external developer ILCA rather than by GameFreakthemselves. On the other hand, GameFreak are not exactly the most outstandingdeveloper out there, and I’m pretty sure the games will be quality-controlledinto oblivion; so why worry? Let the hype take over, baby! What else? I played a bunch of demos lately, which led to some welcomesavings as I didn’t fancy them enough to purchase the games they hailed from.Here’s a quick recap:   — Blaster Master: Instant & utter dislike. I managed to last exactly 30 seconds,before exiting the demo and erasing it from my memory card. Heck, justremembering these 30 seconds of abject old-fashioned platforming makes meretch.  — Cris Tales: The art style kinda offended my retinas, and the gameplay was notstellar enough to make me forget what I saw. Also, I dislike games that looklike cartoons as a rule, as well as games that sell themselves as homages to agenre that’s still alive and kicking. B*tch, if I wanna get myself some JRPG,I’ll go and play some Tales or some Dragon Quest, not some indie that poses as a JRPG homage yet looks like a Disney movie.   — R-Type Final 2: The plasticky art style was not to my retinas' liking at all; butanyway, the game had lost me before that, when it forced some kind of cinematicintro on me. The original R-Type, although I didn’t fancy it, had atleast the decency to let me shoot stuff right away.  —  Sea of Solitude: I liked it at first, actually. Very intuitive gameplay,mesmerizing setting, splendid art style, and a really haunting atmosphere.Alas, that excellent first impression was tainted by the demo’s handholding andpatronizing, which kinda spoilt the joy of discovery and exploration. But thereal dealbreaker came when I realised that SoS, like so many indiesthese days, has a message to deliver; and so, it just won’t letme project my own thoughts and fantasies into its world, which really bothers me. (I didn’t go far enoughto unveil the message in question, but I’d bet my Switch that the whole game isa metaphor for depression or the like.) Still, I haven't written off SoS completely yet; it's still tugging at my gamer's heart ever-so-slightly, and I may well give it a second chance — if only because the gameplay was so darn smooth.   That’s all for my ramblings du jour, dear fellow gamers; I’ll see yousoon with my freshest run report, or any other kind of gaming goodness. In themeantime, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Arc of Alchemist: Breathtaking", "date": "28/04/2021", "text": "There’snot a shred of irony in that title, dear fellow gamers; and I’m not gonna writethat AoA is so bad that it robbed me of my breath, or anything likethat. I am totally sincere here; for the third time since I started thatblog, I find myself loving to pieces a game that was slandered in reviews.The first two were Hometown Story and Astonishia Story; but with AoA,we’re breaking a new record when it comes to the gap between my own feelingsand the general perception of the reviewing community.  See, we’re talking about agame that can claim the horrendous score of 36 on Metacritic, and thedubious honour of being the 6th lowest-rated Switch game on thatsame site since the machine’s release. Heck, the reviews were so insanely scathingthat I gave AoA a hard pass at first, despite the fact that my gaminginstinct was very interested by that game. I thought I was done with AoAthen; but lo and behold, my gaming instinct roared to life lately and claimedthat game, and wouldn’t be swayed by no bad review. I know better than to goagainst the gaming instinct, folks; and that’s how I found myself ordering acopy of the game, to be played upon receipt.  Two and a half hours of play later, I’m deeply in love with AoA— andseriously in awe of it as well. I didn’t choose that post’s title randomly: AoAreally took my breath away, leaving me a bit shuddery and disoriented — in a most pleasantway. First thing first, I dig sandy vistas just as much as wintery vistas. Infact, you could say that I dig all barren, arid, open-horizon vistas,whether they be cold or hot: from the Gobi Desert in Terranigma to theLand of Dusk in Ayesha, those landscapes stir something deep within my soul.AoA’s ergs and regs are no exception, and running through them makes mygamer’s heart flutter deliciously. I genuinely emitted a cry of delight uponentering the darkened pass in the Abandoned City for the first time and seeingmy characters silhouetted against the gushes of sandy wind. Heck yeah,Compile Heart — do you know I love you more by the friggin’ game?  Beyond my being a sucker for all things desert, AoA reawakened thatwondrous feeling of wonderment already roused by games such as Legend ofLegacy and Myst III: Exile. Once again, I felt like an explorer inan unknown world, left free to piece things together and try to understand whathappened. I cannot describe that sweet, puzzled awe that grips my heart everytime a contraption pops out of the sand, reminding me that I’m cruising a worldfull of mysteries. Who built that stuff, and what for? I don’t even want theanswer by the end of the game, to be honest; just wondering, and fantasizingabout that world, is more than enough for me — especially when it’s backed up by such asplendid soundtrack. Oh boy, that soundtrack! It’s heart-wrenchinglysplendid, pure ear-candy that complements the vistas to pure perfection. Let metell you: I ordered the Japanese PS4 Limited Edition just to get my greedy pawson the OST CD, and I don’t regret it one bit. Compile Heart is totallydeserving of that purchase, and more, for giving me so many feels through asingle bloody game. But what about AoA’s glaring flaws, the ones that had reviewersseething and raging? Sure enough, that game is far from being perfect; but it's not that horrendous either. Combat, in particular, is much better than reviews would have led me to believe. It can be a hot mess — that is, if you're too lazy to use the dodging and target-locking features like I am most of the time. When you take the time to use them properly, you gain much tighter control over the flow of battle, and you can enjoy the fulfilling physics and dazzling animations to the fullest. The in medias res story is totally fine by me,because a) I don’t care about stories in RPGs, and b) I kinda like what I’mwitnessing so far. I’ve already gone all mushy seeing Jester awaken to emotionsthrough his cat, and I have an inkling I’ll end up shipping Quinn x Gareth andAxel x Micah before I’m done with the game.  I didn’t quite notice the framerateissue everybody rants about; either I’m very tolerant when it comes toslowdowns in games (which is highly likely anyway), or the game runs better onthe Lite than on the regular Switch — and let’s face it, it’s probably a mix of both.What else? I don’t mind the general fuzziness, the lack of detailed backgroundsand the endlessly beige landscapes, because they come with the territory — meaning both the desert setting and the budget game one. I don’tmind the general simplicity and lack of depth of the game, because I fancy asimple and straightforward game as a refresher on a regular basis. Last but notleast, I don’t mind the lo-fi graphics, because I’m a complete retro whore, andwe all know it.  Longstory short: I adore Arc of Alchemist. It makes me feel things Idon’t feel so often in games these days — wonderment, wanderlust, awe, and thegeneral feeling of being nine years old and taking my first steps into theworld of videogaming again. Heck, it makes me feel, full stop; and anygame that does that is more than worthy of my undying love. So, what does myloving a nearly universally vilified game prove? Well, it proves that onegamer’s trash is another gamer’s treasure indeed, and that my faithful gaminginstinct is the most reliable compass I could ever dream of. I won’t go andrecommend AoA still, for fear of making my fellow gamers lose theirhard-earned money; but heck, I won’t deny my vibrant feelings for that game,and I totally own them. Until more gaming goodness comes, dear fellow gamers,keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sword: The Rillaboom Solo Run", "date": "17/04/2021", "text": "Herecomes Galar Grass Starter’s time to shine — and my, did Rillaboom shine indeed.To boast the highest base Attack of all Grass Starters with a whopping 125 isalready stellar enough — but wait, there’s more: Rillaboom does actually boastthe highest base Attack of all Starters. Like, all Starters since thedawn of the series — let that sink in. My own little Verdure was blessedwith a Lonely Nature, which I instantly deemed the best possible stat-alteringNature as far as the Rillaboom line is concerned: Defense being the grass ape’ssecond-highest stat, it could certainly tolerate a bit of lowering. As you cansee below, my Verdure’s Defense was more than decent enough by the end of myrun.  Enoughabout stats already; let’s talk about Moves, shall we? And my, Rillaboomgot ‘em Moves indeed. Heck, it has the widest learnset of all three Galar Starters,hands down! I took a screenshot every time I got a new Move, with the idea ofposting them; however, there were soon so many of them that I gave up on saididea. They said a picture is worth a thousand worth, but a good ole list isdefinitely more palatable than half a dozen pictures: GrassMoves: Branch Poke, Razor Leaf, Drum Beating,NormalMoves: Double Hit, Slam, BoomburstFightingMoves: Brick Break, Drain PunchDarkMoves: Knock Off, Brutal SwingBugMove: U-Turn (first time I use the stuff in a solosetting, and it works just fine: with a one-Mon team, your lone rangerjust stays put.) Rightabove, you have my ultimate Move pool, the one I used to wipe the floor withLeon and his team. I’ll admit it: I was seriously afraid of his Charizard —heck, Grass Type and Gigantamaxing weren’t bound to end well, now were they?However, it turned out that I needn’t have worried at all: two neatly placedDrain Punch took care of that most frightening of final ‘Mons, whileconveniently refilling my Verdure’s HP bar to boot. If that is not a mostsatisfying way of wrapping up a solo run, I really don’t know what is. Not only didthat run deliver me some mighty fine cruising with a kickass Grass ‘Mon, but it alsointroduced me to what will be known from thereon as the Great Galar Grinding Galore.If you’ve played S&S already, you know where this is headed: to theWild Area, folks. The Wild Area, which I roamed for a good hour and a half,plundering Dens like it was going out of fashion. I’ll admit it: I completelylost myself in the grinding and forgot everything — Motostoke, the GymChallenge, and the very fact that I was playing a Pokemon game. Igrinded so hard that by the time I finally emerged from the Wild Area, dazedand sated, my Verdure was boasting an outrageous Lv.49. Sure enough, hisEV training was lacking, since those levels were gained solely through thegobbling of Rare and Experience Candies: but my oh my, was that grinding andfarming breather insanely good. I think I found myself a new Pokemonkink, and I really cannot promise I won’t make more early stops at the WildArea in runs to come. Now’s thetime to deliver my final thoughts: Rillaboom is the single greatest GrassStarter created since the dawn of the series — yeah, I said it. He boasts thebulkiness of Venusaur with a much faster growth, the offensive oomph ofChesnaught with much better looks, and a learnset that’s the stuff of solo rundreams. Rillaboom is a kickass Starter, a kickass Grass ‘Mon, and a kickass‘Mon full stop. I’m glad to part with S&S for the time beingon such a fulfilling run; I’ll see you soon with more gaming goodness, dearfellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sword: The Inteleon Solo Run ", "date": "11/04/2021", "text": "Here comes my second Galar run report, starring the resident Water Starter.RNG granted me a female Sobble, which I gladly took in; I deem Inteleon moreconsistent with a female-heavy distribution as far as looks are concerned, justlike his Sun&Moon counterpart Primarina.  Upon discovering that my little Aquavista boasted a Calm Nature,I started devising plans to make her a mixed attacker. Those plans came truefor a while, as I put together a Move pool made of Water Pulse, Sucker Punch,U-Turn and Liquidation. However, I didn’t stick to that pool: Sucker Punch istoo iffy to use overall, U-Turn was a bit too weak, and Liquidation couldn’thold a candle to Scald, Snipe Shot and Hydro Pump. That watery trio became my ultimateMove pool, along with Shadow Ball for extra coverage — all Moves above 80 power, perfect to drown allopposition. I’ll say it: as far as Galar Starters are concerned, the Inteleonline has the most kickass and powerful offensive Moves.  You might think that three Water Moves was a surefire way to putmyself in hot water (indeed); however, I breezed through the game’s late stagesmuch more easily than I did with Cinderace, and at lower levels to boot. Theonly real roadblock was Rose and his team of Steel ‘Mons — not that Water isparticularly weak against Steel; the problem there was undeleveling catching upto me. It should have caught up to me earlier, mind you (more on that later);but the late fight distribution is so darn favourable to Inteleon that I couldprogress much more swiftly than with Cinderace and Rillaboom. Long story short: Inteleon is awesome, and completely on parwith broken Water Starters of Gens past such as Empoleon and Primarina. Hisdesign is very much a hit-or-miss thing; but should you hate it, you’d stillhave to tip your hat to the brilliant James Bond inspiration. (For the record, Ifriggin’ dug it that design myself, despite the bipedal factor.) I’llsee you soon with more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers — Pokemon-relatedor else; in the meantime, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "   My Very Own Favourite Developers", "date": "05/04/2021", "text": "The gaming industry lives and dies by its developers indeed. I’vetalked a lot about my favourite games over the years, but I’ve never really givencredit to their developers beyond the occasional impromptu shout-out at theturn of a paragraph. It’s time for a more substantial declaration of love; andso, dear fellow gamers, here is my own private paean to the developers that routinelyrock my gaming world.  Nihon Falcom: Nosurprise there, we all know I’m a complete Nihon Falcom wh*re. Bar the,erm, not exactly stellar Brandish, every single Nihon Falcom game I’veplayed was an instant hit with me. I've rooted for Estelle and Joshua harder than for any other RPG couple, and Ys managed to become one of my favourite ARPG series with two instalments only. I like Nihon Falcom's breath-taking attention todetail, I love the fact that they take all the time they need to develop gamesyet keep their series running over literal decades, and I adore the uniqueatmosphere of their titles. Nihon Falcom games are timeless yet deeply original;they’re instant cult classics with a dark horse quality, if that makes sense.And my, I still deem the Silver Anniversary Edition of Ys: Memories ofCelceta the best special edition to ever grace us collectors — and the onlyspecial edition that I actually held onto when I transferred my preciouscollection from their bulky and old-fashioned plastic cases to their sleek andfancy Unikeep binders. Kemco: Yeah, I friggin’ adoreKemco. From childhood favourite Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle to their endlessstream of splendid budget RPGs, with detours to unexpected hidden gems such as Raging Loop, I’ve had a most fulfilling ride with Kemco over the years. Sometimes, I’m nottoo far from thinking that maybe Kemco RPGs are my true calling in gaming, andthat I could be happy just playing them and nothing else. Of course, I won’t dothat, because why would I — still, the very fact that I can entertain the thought says a lotabout the grip Kemco has on my gamer’s heart. I bought a dedicated SD card justto store the RPGs they were kind enough to release on the Switch, and I’dgladly purchase more, much more if could. In a nutshell: shut up and take my money, my sweet Kemco, and throw more games atme. Compile Heart: I never,ever claimed to have good taste, neither in gaming nor in other areas. I like what I like — if it happens to be fancy, then it’s mighty fine;if it happens to be tacky, then it’s mighty fine too. And well, my undying lovefor Compile Heart, a developer that’s been ridiculed at best and vilified atworst, is the very proof of my gaming instinct’s unruliness in all thingstaste. CH and I were off to a stellar start indeed, as I had an instant crush on their very first release; since then, every game of them I’ve played has delightedme. Hyperdimension Neptunia? One of my top 5 Vita RPG series, b*tch. SorcerySaga? My very first Vita game, safely nested in my top 5 FavouriteRoguelikes ever. The Moe FPDC? Heck, I squealed like a little girl whenI learnt that Moero Crystal was coming to the Switch. Theonly thing Compile Heart could do to make me love them impossibly more would beto bring the Agarest and Death end re;Quest series to the Switch(wink wink, nudge nudge).   Experience: Adeveloper that specialises in one of my favourite subgenres under the RPG sun,and that rocks at it to boot — why, of course I had to love those guys topieces. Demon Gaze was one of my most fulfilling and memorable FPDC rideto date, and I have no doubt that their other FPDC will sweep me off my feet aswell. I’m also really eager to tackle their Spirit Hunter series and seehow they fare in the VN department. Ray Gigant’s heavy-duty emphasis onnarrative showed that they harboured VN inclinations, and it’s great to seethose inclinations turn into full-blown games rather than keep pollutingperfectly good FPDCs.  Atlus: I discovered that iconic developer back in 2012, as their glory days were coming to a closeand they were slowly retreating from developing games and refocusing on publishing.Now, am I sad that I missed their halcyon days, the time when their very namewas the epitome of uniqueness, edginess and coolness? Well, not really.I can play and enjoy their games even though their prime is over — and I certainlydon’t shy away from doing just that. My brushes with the Persona and Etrian Odyssey series were deeply fulfilling already; and I’d be surprised if Ididn’t end up loving their Trauma Center and Shin Megami Tenseiseries just as much.  Sting Entertainment:When it comes to niche games and general originality, Sting can morethan easily rival Atlus. They have a way of effortlessly delivering outlandishconcepts in well-crafted packages, and most of their games are little hidden gems. Their Dept. Heaven series could give wet dreams to themost blasé RPG veteran, despite missing more entries than the original StarWars saga. I sure as heck enjoyed pretty much every single game of theirs I’ve played — Riviera, Dungeons Travelers2, Hexyz Force, Utawarerumono, Pandora's Reflection, you name it — and I’m pretty sure I’ll love all the games Istill have to play.   Honourable mentions: Otomate: Okay, let’s get real here: I’ve played and enjoyed enough of Otomate’s input to acknowledge theirimportance in my gaming career. They're the king of the otome hill, and few can do thegenre justice as masterfully as them; and I’m sure gonna keep purchasing theirstuff upon release without the slightest shred of shame.  PQube: That London-basedteam is technically more a publisher than a developer; but as I own asubstantial portion of their input already, I had to give them a heartyshout-out. There’s some juvenile energy and authentic passion in their frenzied release activity, and I can only commend them for bringing delightfully niche titles toour shores. I’ve played a couple of their offerings already, and I ended up loving them all — so much sothat I developed a pavlovian response that makes me hit the purchase button assoon as I see their name in a game’s description.  Quintet: That crew has been dormant for so long that they're probably defunct by now — heck, they've not released a game since the PS2 days. Their resume is far from being impressive, with only 16 games released between 1990 and 2004, most of them completely unknown. However, they created the so-called 'Soul Blazer Trilogy', which are arguably some of the most memorable ARPGs ever released on the SNES. Terranigma is an absolute cult classic of mine, a game that haunted me like few RPGs before and after it; and just for that, I had to tip my hat to that Sleeping Beauty of developers.It goes without saying that I totally encourage you to share your own favourite developers in the comments, dear fellow gamers; as for me, I’ll seeyou soon with more gaming goodness. Take care!"},
{"title": "The Pokemon Sword & Shield Report: The Blueprint", "date": "28/03/2021", "text": "Hullo, dear fellow gamers! Hope you’re doing mighty fine, and gaminglike the wind. I’m currently busy preparing a massive S&S report; somassive, in fact, that I’ll publish it over the course of a few weeks, withposts about other games in between. Still, the blueprint is there already — and all ready — andso this report will unfold as such: Part 1: The Most RPG-ish Pokemon Game of Them AllPart 2: Say Goodbye to the TropesPart 3: My Own Private Pros & ConsPart 4: The Ultimate Overview An appetizing four-course menu, if I do say so myself. And sureenough, there will also be run reports as side dishes! As a matter of fact, I’mdone polishing off runs with all three Starters, and reports for my Inteleonand Rillaboom runs are in the pipelines as I’m writing this. I can alreadydeliver my own personal ranking for the Galar Starter trio: as far as battleprowess in a solo setting is concerned, Inteleon is the absolute sh*t;Rillaboom comes close second, while Cinderace brings up the rear with a bit of lag. Still, all three Galar Starters are dope indeed — heck, they’reprobably the most kickass trio of Starters this side of Gen I.  For the record, I've already decided that I’ll exclusively play as Victorin Sword, and as Gloria in Shield. It does feel right and perfectto me, just like playing solely as Selene in Sun and Elio in Moon does. Not only that, but I already settled on names I’ll probably use everysingle time: Victor will be known as Durandal, and Gloria as Priwen — and yes, those are totallya mythical sword and shield. For some reason, I really feel the need to createa fixed narrative in my S&S experience: my Ones and Monlies can andwill change, but my Trainers have to be the same over and over again. Heck,I’ll probably even go with the same hair and skin tones every time: for me,Durandal must be the lower right corner type, whilst Priwen can be noneother than the lower left corner type. That’s my S&S Trainer customjam, and I’ll stand by it ‘til the day I get bored of these games — which will probably never happen.   Indeed, I mentioned in my Cinderace run report that I couldn’t getenough of S&S; and well, this feeling is only growing stronger bythe run. I feel an intense thirst for all thing Galar, a thirst thatseems unquenchable; and I wouldn’t be surprised if S&S became myabsolute favourite Pokemon games over time. Those games havesomething magical, a certain je ne sais quoi I’ve never feltbefore in any Pokemon title; and yet, I was missing that magicwithout even knowing it. I realise I don’t sound too rational and clear here,but this is exactly how I feel about S&S. I feel like I’vebarely scraped the surface of that lovely pair, and that they have so, somuch more to offer me. And well, I’ll be mightily glad to take it. As much as I’d love to keep gorging on S&S, I won’t do soright now. Not only would it be boring to go for another Pokemon rampageso soon after the last one, but I feel like I need to let the dough rest, so tospeak. I need to digest my three Starters runs, and proceed my budding feelingsfor S&S; and heck, other games are tugging at my gaming instinct’sstrings. My dear fellow gamers, I’ll see you soon with my many S&Sreports, and fresh gaming goodness as well; in the meantime, take care and keepplaying!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sword: The Cinderace Solo Run", "date": "20/03/2021", "text": "Dear fellow gamers, now’s the time to talk about Sword&Shield.I have a lot to say about that pair indeed, and I’ll do that soon enough in a seriesof dedicated posts; for now, suffice it to say that I friggin’ lovethose latest of canon Pokemon offerings, and that I somehow can’t getenough of them.  The opener of my S&S roll is none other than the resident FireStarter, which I would totally have nicknamed ‘Bend It Like Beckam’ if not forthe annoying 12-letters limitation. The link with England’s most beloved sportis pretty blatant in Cinderace’s design; and despite my utter lack of interestfor said sport, I’m extremely fond of the fiery rabbit’s looks. The fact thatwe’re dealing with a bipedal ‘Mon doesn’t bother me in the slightest this timearound, because we’re not running with the overdone wrestler theme. And thankArceus, Cinderace is pure Fire Type! I was dreading the usual Fire/Fightingcombination, or another uninspired mix that would have smothered the creature’sflame; but GameFreak blessingly let Fire burn bright and unhindered this timearound.  ‘Mons with sky-high Attack and Speed are always stellar solo runmaterial, and Cinderace was no exception. My own Firecracker was blessedwith a Brave nature, which meant an even delightfully higher Attack; and well,his other stats weren’t too shabby either. Cinderace’s only real crappy statbeing his Sp. Attack, making my Firecracker a pure Physical attacker was ano-brainer. The thing is, I quickly realized that I wouldn’t have much to workwith. Cinderace’s ‘natural’ learnset is kinda shallow, and infested withlow-power Moves to boot. Let me tell you: I was stuck with Flame Charge, FireFang, Headbutt and Double Kick for roughly three quarters of my run. Those areMoves under 70 Power, folks! I needed a pool with a little more oomph;and so, I went out of my way to snatch Fire Punch (75 Power), Iron Head, LowSweep and Zen Headbutt (80 Power). Upon the last fight, I replaced Fire Punchwith Cinderace’s signature Move Pyro Ball, and finally got an uber-powerfulMove. That’s 120 power for you; combine that with a boosted Attack and aCharcoal, and you get a Move that can burn everything to a crisp. The onlyreason I didn’t use Pyro Ball sooner is its ridiculous 5 PP, which istotally unfit for solo run purposes.  As limited as Firecracker’s Move pool was, it worked incredibly wellin Galar. I destroyed Team Yell’s Dark ‘Mons over and over again with DoubleKick, I obliterated Hop’s Corviknight and Rillaboom with my Fire Moves, and Igenerally made mincemeat out of everything. That’s not to say there weren’troadblocks, starting with Nessa’s Water Gym and Raihan’s Dragon Gym (I’ll have moreto say about Raihan, trust me); but in the end, it was still a smooth andfulfilling run. I spent 13 hours cruising through Galar; that’s a mighty fineplaying time as far as I’m concerned, and I have good hopes of going under the12-hour, or even 10-hour mark, with fast-leveling ‘Mons and a better knowledgeof the region. Long story short: Cinderace is a kickass Fire Starter, and Icannot wait to cruise with Inteleon and Rillaboom and see if they’re as dope ashim. I’ll see you soon with my own private paean to Galar, dear fellow gamers;until then, keep playing like the wind and take care!"},
{"title": "Lily of the Hollow – Resurrection: A challenge", "date": "13/03/2021", "text": "The aforementioned challenge is twofold, dear fellow gamers. The firstpart of it was to play the game until the (bitter) end; the second part is tofind something to write about it. I cleared the first part already; so, Ishould manage to clear the second part and squeeze a couple of words about thatgame out of my brain.  Mind you, I came very close to giving up on the first part of thatchallenge. The reason is pretty limpid, and should be known to anybody whoheard about LotH already: the text, folk. The retina-stabbing,grammar-forsaken, atrociously translated text. It’s not Google Translate bad;it’s much, much worse — believe me when I say that anything GT spouts sounds like Shakespearecompared to LotH’s wordy abominations. I swear, that text doesn’t soundlike it’s been translated by a human being — or anything from that galaxy, for that matter. Icould rave on and on about the mind-boggling crassness of all things textual inLotH, but the bottom line is this: it makes the game nearly darn unplayable.  Should you choose to suspend your grammatical common sense and powerthrough like I did, you’ll quickly notice that bad text or no bad text, thestory is rushed and painfully lacking in all areas. Romance build-up is justglaringly absent as world build-up, making for a very unfulfilling VNexperience; anybody who’s played LotH certainly won’t blame me forditching the game after polishing off Claudia’s route.   That’s a lot of flaws for a single VN; yet, not only didn’t I hate LotH’sguts, but it actually left a positive imprint on my gamer’s soul. 70% of thatpositive imprint is the work of the snowy landscapes in which the whole storyunfolds. You know I’m a sucker for such landscapes, dear fellow gamers; and LotH’spristine alpine vistas are some of the most gorgeous I’ve ever feasted my eyesupon in a VN. The remaining 30% can be proudly claimed by the splendidcrystalline soundtrack, which perfectly complements the aforementioned vistasto create a most mesmerizing wintry atmosphere.  Still, I cannot recommend LotH at all, even to the mosthardcore VN aficionado. It would feel like daylight robbery even if it werefree — let alonewith an outrageous 5,99 euros price tag. Shovelware is strong with the NintendoeShop indeed; and I’ll roam those uncharted territories with great vigilancefrom now on. I’ll see you soon with more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers;until then, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Asdivine Hearts: Just as purrfect as I hoped", "date": "07/03/2021", "text": "My gaming instinct desperately wanted to play Asdivine Hearts, soI played Asdivine Hearts. And blimey, do I mean it when I say“desperately” — which, incidentally, is also the reason I’m playing AD on mySwitch rather than on my Vita. See, I own the Limited Run physical version of ADfor the Vita, and that’s the version I should logically be playing; but forsome reasons I won’t bother detailing here, my whole Vita collection is stuckat my family’s place, 500 km away from my own den. With no hope of retrievingsaid Vita collection before a couple of weeks, what was an avid gamer to do toplay AD? To purchase the Switch digital version, of course! That’s mygaming instinct’s needs covered right here and now, and a little more money formy beloved Kemco. Pretty neat arrangement, ain’t it? After that digression that serves no purpose beyond proving I’m aslave to the gaming instinct, it’s time to talk about my lovely first hourswith AD. Beyond offering good ole RPG tropes such as ‘One village, onedungeon, one problem’ and ‘Update your gear in every settlement’, AD isfull to the brim with neat gameplay features that may or may not have beeninspired by older games. The Jewel system reminded me nicely of my beloved Childrenof Mana mixed with a bit of Tetris; as for the battle formationsystem, it's a deeper and more satisfying take on the 'Front Row/Back Row' system that's a fixture in FPDC. Talking aboutbattles, I can simply never get bored of how lovingly detailed thebattle sprites are. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a high level of detail onbattle sprites — let alone in a budget game. It makes every fight a feast for theeyes, with every new foe making me utter awed wows and gees. My,Kemco, how do you always manage to rock my world? I swear, I’m loving you moreby the game.   Talking about love, AD has some neat little romance going on.As MC Zack, I have no less than four ladies fawning over me: tsundere childhoodfriend Stella, yandere ladyboy Uriel, ice queen onee-san Celine and, last butnot least, potty-mouthed furry Felix. I’ll be honest: Felix is totes my waifuhere. Not only is she a cat, but she’s the most interesting and lesscliché of the four. She’s lively, witty, hilarious at times yet serious anddevoted when needs be — and she has that great fluffy, chunky body to boot: what’s not tolove, seriously? Jokes aside, I’ll probably try to get all romantic endingsnonetheless, just for curiosity’s sake.   That won’t happen right now, though. I’ve set foot in Reveria andcleared the story’s first arc; and so, it’s time to take a break and sailtowards new gaming pastures. I’ll be back to AD sooner or later, that’sfor sure; and when I do, I’ll probably be overjoyed to be reacquainted with themany things I love in that gem of a game — or with that gem of game, full stop. It’s one ofthose RPGs that make me happy: the mere thought of it makes me allgiddy, and actually playing it makes me all mushy and mellow. Until I dive intoAD again, let’s meet again with fresh gaming goodness, shall we? Untilnext time, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Final Fantasy VIII and IX: Not in this lifetime, baby", "date": "01/03/2021", "text": "This is it, dear fellow gamers: I’m officially renouncing late ‘90s FinalFantasy entries, for now and for all eternity. I renounced FF VII long ago already, and I gave up on FF Xafter two failed attempts at tackling it; yet I had good hopes that I couldstill enjoy what’s in between. VIII and IX are more subdued, lesscult classic-ish FF entries that still have their aficionados; and I thought Icould become one of them. Alas, that was not meant to be, and I don’t thinkthat ever will.   I didn’t manage to play the pair long enough to give detailed runreports; I’ll just say that FF VIII didn’t let me fight quickly enoughfor my taste, and that FF IX’s ATB system killed all the battle joy forme. But the main turnoff was this: I absolutely loathe the way these gamestake themselves so darn seriously. They come with a whole universe thatthey try shoving down your throat right from the first flashy and overdonecutscene, and they present that universe with such hieratic,‘oh-we’re-trying-so-hard’ rigidity that it becomes utterly off-putting. I’m notsaying I want meta-irony and fourth wall breaking on a regular basis in myRPG; what I do want, on the other hand, is a bit of humility and the awarenessthat RPGs are not movies and never will be.   This is not just about FF, mind you. The late ‘90s are my mosthated gaming era precisely because of their pretentious, over-the-top attempts at cinematicstorytelling. The industry was going allGeorges Lucas on itself, nipping and tucking and trying to shove in everythingthey couldn’t afford until then because of a lack of technical means. There wasno insight about the specificity of gaming, about its deeply interactive nature; and hindsight about it was yet to come. That lack of awareness gave us a number of overdone titles that didn’t age quite as gracefully astheir simpler, more game-y predecessors. Not sayin’ FF VIII and IXbelong to that category, mind you; but heck, they’re definitely trying too hard for my taste.With late ‘90s FF instalments out of the picture, I have fewcanon ones left to play. That would be FF III and IV on the DS, FFV and VI on the GBA, FF XII on the Switch, and FFXIIIon the PC. Being a complete retro whore, I’m quite confident I’ll love IIIto VI; and since I’m also a total ARPG and dungeon crawler whore, I’llprobably enjoy XII and XIII as well. With that said, I’ll see yousoon with fresh run reports, dear fellow gamers; until then, keep playing andtake care!"},
{"title": "Nightshade: The Route Report", "date": "17/02/2021", "text": "Since Nightshade offers visual love clues and an affectiongauge, I had no problems landing on my routes of choice and snatching the bestending right away. Since all routes are available from the get-go, I couldindulge in playing them in the order I wanted. I saved the best for last, asusual in such cases; and so, dear fellow gamers, here’s my very own routereport for your enjoyment.  Chojiro: My my, what ahardcore opener that route was. All your friends die a painful and cruel death,you’re played like a puppet by your own scumbag of a father, and you have todeal with the guilt of lusting for your first cousin. Is that the writers’not-so-subtle way of saying that incest is bad? Anyway, both Enju and Chojirohave to overcome a ton of mental and practical hurdles to get together; andblimey, I cannot help but think that they completely deserve romantic happinessafter that. Chojiro is the resident ice queen, and you know I usually don’t fancythat trope (cue Dante, Van Helsing, Yanagi and Shidou) ; but this time around,I really enjoyed it. I’d wager it’s because you can see the heart beat underthe ice in Chojiro’s case, which makes you anticipate the moment said ice willbreak. It does break allright, in a sober (ice cannot transmute into fire,after all) yet sweet and fulfilling way. Thank you, writers, for reconciling mewith the ice queen trope — if only for a single game.    Hanzo: Nighshade’stake on that most famous shinobi reminded me nicely of my lovely man Kaze inFE Fates; needless to say, that made me very partial towards Hanzo. Hisroute didn’t disappoint me: the way he both protects and lifts Enju up is thestuff wholesome relationships are made off, and Enju herself brings him somemuch-needed peace of mind by helping him come to terms with his torturouspast. Hanzo being the sombre, hardly expressive type, his route could easilyhave been brooding and boring. But the writers, them geniuses, managed to avertthat obvious trap by sneaking in cute little digressions about Hanzo’s smileand hairstyle, as well as a nicely steamy yet not overdone Huddling for Warmthsequence. Those moments remind us that Hanzo is human first and foremost,before Hanzo himself remembers it and chooses Enju over his shinobi duties atthe end of the route.   Goemon: With his strategicallyrevealing clothing, his sultry smile, his bedroom eyes and his libertine label,Goemon is totally the game’s sexy b*tch. He’s really a libertine in nameonly, as he only has eyes for Enju from the moment she enters her field of view;but let’s face it, his slutty persona is quite masterfully handled. It doesn’thurt that he’s also pretty hunky as far as otome beaus go; not only does thathunkiness really show in CGs, but there’s also a steamy narrative thread thatinvolves Enju drooling over his large hands. On top of being lascivious, Goemon is playful, cheerful and a sheeroptimist; factor in the happy ending that sees all of Enju’s friends make italive, and you get the most light-hearted route of the whole game. Still, Goemon’sroute boasts more than enough suspense and tension to keep one on their toes. I’mobviously referring to the whole ‘He betrayed me, he betrayed me not’ arc, in whichGoemon regains the lead of the Fuuma clan. As it happens quite late in thestory, one cannot help but pray Goemon still has Enju’s back, and that thewhole thing is but an elaborate setup whose purpose will be revealed soon. That’sa pretty basic narrative trick, but it works beautifully nonetheless; and boy,was I relieved when Goemon finally put Enju’s mental agony — and mine — to rest.    Kuroyuki: My meagreJapanese knowledge tells me that ‘Kuroyuki’ can be translated as ‘black snow’.If that’s the meaning the writers went for, then it’s true genius; becauseKuroyuki is indeed a pure boy who’s been stained beyond repair by his gruesomeupbringing. Man, that route hit me hard. Granted, I fully expectedKuroyuki’s chirpy personality to be but a mere mask; but I really couldn’t haveguessed how much despair and pain were hidden underneath. The description ofKuroyuki’s ordeal was chilling, and my soul wept for the poor boy.I have to commend the writers (again) for creating an obsession-themedroute that doesn’t feature a complete psychopath. Sure, Kuroyuki is no angel;but his ruthless killings are justified by both his shinobi work and histwisted training. He also ditches his manipulative ways as soon as he realisesthat he doesn’t need them to gain Enju’s affections, and it’s pretty clear thatsaid ways were only a mean to an end and not a core part of his personality. (Andheck, can you really blame a shinobi for being manipulative?) Kuroyuki is the resident childhood friend, and he’s probably the bestone I’ve ever seen in an otome. You can feel the bond between him andEnju; I swear, the description of their childhood antics reminded me of my own childhoodantics with my cousins. There’s a sweet, endearing, childish complicitybetween them, and it’s unique to their relationship. Not only that, but theirlifelong bond actually serves the story instead of being a mere fan-serviceytrope: it makes perfect sense that Kuroyuki should remember Enju and only her, becausethey’re the exact same age and have basically never known life without eachother. Gee, the intensity!   Gekkamaru: Kuroyukiwas intense enough already; but oh my, does his aniki Gekkamaru top him off.Look, I’ll bare my heart here: I kinda fell in love with Gekkamaru myself, andhis route can now claim the honour of being my favourite otome route ever.Gekkamaru’s route has everything: the mutual devotion, the tenderness,the lust, the gallantry, the suspense, the thrill and most importantly, thepure, unadulterated love. Heck, we’re even treated to a poignant ‘Ai shiteru’from the boy! And jeez, that Moon and Sky quote was stupidly intense — I swear, it made meblush a little. The plot twist was stellar, and the way Gekkamaru overcame thetwo spells battling for the control of his mind through his deep, genuine, homegrownlove for Enju made me all mushy inside. But the jewel in the crown of that route is the physical chemistrybetween Enju and Gekkamaru, which roars to life as soon as they hug each otherfor the first time ever. That very sequence is already ardent enough as such,with all those mentions of melting into each other and becoming one — heck, you canreally feel the chemistry taking over here. But the fact that the two arereeling with the desire to do it again as soon as it’s over really did me in, asI’m a massive sucker for all things Repressed Lust and Can’t Keep my Hands to Myself in fiction. Gekkamaru’s and Enju’s interactions are deeply erotic,yet also wholesome as heck; and their intense, fulfilling love is most definitelythe stuff canon routes should be made off.    Long story short: I loved every single route in Nightshade, somuch so that I actually went for a second helping and replayed them all.The fact that all routes share the same core structure and tell similar eventsdidn’t bother me in the slightest, because I loved that whole Battle Royale affairthe game had going. Not only that, but having a similar story for all routes neatlyemphasizes the differences between the beaus and Enju’s relationships with them.That game is a pure, dazzling gem to my eyes; I wouldn’t take anything out ofit, and the only thing I’d add to make it more impossibly perfect would be alove story between Ennosuke and Kyara. I shipped these two hard, and I’mpretty sure I’m not the only one. Anyway, my work here is done; I’ll see yousoon with fresh run reports, dear fellow gamers. In the meantime, keep playingand take care!"},
{"title": "The Great Vita Digital Blowout", "date": "14/02/2021", "text": "Hullo, dear fellow gamers! Hope you’re doing fine, and gaming like thewind. I am myself; and if you’re wondering how the OWOG system is working out,I’d say it’s working mightily well. Yet you cannot see it because alas, I canhardly find some time to write my weekly gaming reports these days. Thingsshould settle soon enough; in the meantime, I’ll try to keep posting as oftenas I can. Stay tuned! ^^For now, I’ll treat you to a meaty, many-for-one play report. See, Ifinally got round to taking care of all my Vita digital games once and for all.Many of these titles have been purchased on a whim during PSN sales, and mostof them have been sitting in my gaming library for years. As I have more gamesto play than ever and don’t give a crap about digital stuff anyway, I decidedto give them all a chance to shine before ousting them from my memory cards.There were many casualties, and few survived the ordeal. Without further ado,here are all the games that didn’t make the cut so far, and why they didn’tmake it.   Romancing SaGa 3 & Romancing SaGa 2: I gave the former the motherof all college tries, as I promised to do many posts ago. I picked Katarina this time, andthings started auspiciously: the whole stealthy sequence in the castle was greatfun, and Katarina’s tale was nicely engaging. Alas, things unravelled as soon asI was allowed to fight. I’m sorry, but SaGa 3’s combat is just too darnslow for my taste; and RSG 2, which I tried right after, suffers fromthe same issue. I really cannot get over those molasse-like fights; maybeI’ll try my hand at the original SNES games one day, but the remakes are acomplete no-go. Neko Buro – Cats Block: Puzzle games are usually not my cup of tea,but I thought the kitty factor could make this one palatable. It did for awhile; however, I quickly grew bored and ditched the thing without regret. I’drather replay Aqua Kitty DX to get my fill of cute felines, thanks verymuch. Dragon Fin Soup: I could deal with the oversized sprites, theapproximative physics and the gloomy colour palette; however, DFS lost mewhen it started punishing me for destroying breakables. What sort of darn c*ckteasing is that, game? Heck, it’s like setting a plate of macarons under mynose and slapping my hand when I try to take one. Keep yourdestructible-yet-not environments; as for me, I’ll take my mashing urges toanother ARPG. Sumioni – Demon Arts: It looks great, it plays great, it’s a greatgame overall. But it’s a Platformer, and Platformers are anathema to me — especially aPlatformer in which I have to draw the darn platforms myself. Heck, it’salready complicated enough to land on them, let alone to draw them!Multi-tasking is not my forte, and that game requires ample amounts of it.Drawing platforms, jumping on them, fighting enemies, unleashing specialattacks; my hands and brain begged for mercy, and I was more than glad tohumour them by dropping Sumioni. Spectral Souls – RotEE: A.k.a. the Loading Times from Hell. Now lookeehere, game: you’re actually running on my Vita from a digital file, not on myPSP from an UMD; so you have absolutely no excuse. And since you also look likea giant turd full of shitty shades of brown, I had no qualms about ditchingyou before the end of the first fight. Undertale: That indie title is so critically acclaimed that I grewcurious, despite the fact that I fancy neither indie games nor games that tryto deliver a meta-message about gaming. Undertale is both, and it boredme stiff after an hour of play. Not only is the gameplay tedious as heck, butthe guilt-tripping is seriously annoying. The last thing I want is a game thattries to patronize me — b*tch, I’ve had mixed feelings about killing foes in games since Istomped on my first Chibobo in Super Mario Land. I’m acutely aware ofthe ambiguity of gratification through eradication in games, and I fully acceptit nonetheless. Cladun – This is an RPG! & Cladun x2: The series' last instalment hadfailed to enthral me already, and those first two did as well. I really cannotdescribe precisely what I don’t like in the Cladun games; they justdon’t click with me, period. I could tell you I don’t like the over-pixelatedgraphics, or that I get that persistent feeling that those games are trying toohard to be meta and witty; but really, the bottom line is that I cannotget into Cladun no matter how hard I try. The 3rd Birthday: The PSN description promised me an ARPG;yet what I got was much closer to a Tomb Raider-y action game,and a seriously gloomy one at that. Combat systems that require actual motorskills are the ban of my life; and so, it should surprise no one that I gave upon that game after the first (failed) fight. Croixleur Sigma: I actually liked that Hack 'n' Slash at first, for its greatphysics and frantic fights; yet it’s so repetitive that I dropped it after acouple of stages. Mind you, I like repetition and mindless A-buttonmashing in my real-time combat; yet even I couldn’t help but grow bored of those tinycircular fighting arenas that all look the same. That game has nothing to offerbut waves after waves of pesky foes, and it gets old very quickly. Hatoful Boyfriend: Budget otome that tries way too hard to be edgy,and forget to tell a good story — or a story, full stop. That game is little morethan a bunch of VN and otome tropes mashed together; alas, the final productnever quite gels. It could certainly do a fine job as Baby's first otome, but it's clearly not meaty enough to satiate a veteran. Brandish – The Dark Revenant: With its fiddly physics and yuckygraphics, that relic should have stayed safely tucked in the ‘90s where itbelongs. It’s an historical curio, that much is sure; but it’s better studiedfrom afar than played. Sorry, Nihon Falcom: I’m totally your b*tch, but I won’t suck upeverything with your name on it. Elminage Original: An old-fashioned FPDC à la Wizardry. Beingthe total FPDC whore I am, this game could, and should, have made the cut. Alas for EO, I already own a crap ton of prettier, more modern, physical FPDC — starting with a much better series with the same initials.    That’s all for the rejects, folks! As for the ones that made the cut,I promise to play them seriously in the upcoming weeks. Here’s the list forfuture reference:  Monster MonpieceDanganronpa 3Trails of The Sky SCFinal Fantasy VIIIFinal Fantasy IXUtawarerumono: Prelude to the FallenCorpse Party: Blood Drive Let me tell you: I feel mightily better after settling those games’cases for good. This kinda shows that as far as shearing one’s backlog goes,the feeling of being done with a game is crucial, and totallyindependent from the actual playing time. With that said, I’ll see you soonwith fresh run reports, dear fellow gamers. Until then, keep playing and takecare!"},
{"title": "Nightshade: The Love Story That Nearly Never Was", "date": "07/02/2021", "text": "Indeed, I came dangerously close to missing on that game entirely; andmy, what a pity that would have been. This is simply one of the bestotomes I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing, a game that ticks all the boxesto qualify for perfect otome in your truly’s eyes.    I’ll come to these boxes in a minute; but first, I have to explain howand why Nightshade nearly didn’t join my precious collection. See, mytepid experience with the Hakuoki series made me wary of all thingsFeudal Japan; add to this the fact that I’m not fond of works based onhistorical facts as a rule, and you’ll understand why I was very reluctant toimport a copy of Nightshade. Oh wait, did I forget to mention this? Theonly way to get Nightshade physical is to import the Japanese version,which supports English. That’s a good thing as a rule, and I can only wish moregames would emulate this; but in Nightshade’s case, it was yet anotherreason not to bother with that game. So why did I change my mind? Well, let’ssay the glowing reviews and the splendiferous, gorgeous-beyond-belief artswayed me.  One Ebay order later, I was playing Nightshade — and falling freakin’hard for it. And now’s the time to mention all the Perfect Otome boxesticked by that game. To quote Britney Spears (again), the gripping Battle Royale-ish story is a must, and Teita’s dazzlingcharacter design is a plus;and so are the lush soundtrack, the stellar voice acting and the convenientaffection meters and clues. But most importantly, Nightshade is an otome with wholesome romance. It’s not an Otomate offering, which means no confinement route, nofruitcake and no wolf in sheep’s clothing — and my, is it relaxing not to have toworry about the MC’s fortune (and your own sanity) for a change.    Talking about the MC, I really fancied her. Not only does she havevery memorable looks, but she’s nicely fleshed-out and undergoes some verysubtle and well-handled character development. It’s worth noting that saidcharacter development is partly influenced by the guy she wounds up with, whichis both very believable and highly interesting. I have to admit I don’t quiteagree with the many reviews describing her as your typical damsel-in-distressand mourning her lack of agency and badasseness. Far from being a helpless crybaby, she's a humble and mature young woman who's aware of her limitations and tries to overcome them whenever she can. Not only that, but her attitude is perfectly consistent with her background. Sure enough, she’s a shinobi; but she’s also been sheltered andprotected her whole life, and she has to face an ordeal that would basicallybreak anyone. Can you really blame her for leaning on someone in such circumstances?Not only that, but she’s no Rey Skywalker, i.e. a natural prodigy whose innatetalents come from her blood; her parents were regular shinobis, which meansthat she has to work hard like everybody else to progress. And pray tell, howmuch progress can she expect to make during a couple of weeks on the run? Notmuch indeed; and yet, she does manage to progress still in most routes. Talking about the routes, I’ll see you soon with a dedicated report. After that, I’ll sail away from VN shores for a while; not only do Ihave my fill for the time being, but my gaming instinct now craves more engagingofferings. Until next time, dear fellow gamers, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Everdark Tower & Archlion Saga: Lovely RPG quickies", "date": "30/01/2021", "text": "Sometimes, an RPG veteran just craves a quick and easy treat;something that can be polished off in a single evening, while still deliveringa healthy dose of grinding and a sense of accomplishment at the end of the run.And lo and behold, the two Kemco offerings mentioned above provide exactlythat.  I’m lumping these two games under the same post, because they boast the exact samestructure, only with different sprites, skills and story. That structure goesas such: —     An averageplaytime of 3 hours for full completion, i.e. reaching Lv. 99 and beating thefinal boss.—     Fivechapters with a progression bar, and automatic save after each random fight andmenu opening.—     First-personturn-based combat à la Dragon Quest, with a common HP and stat pool forall allies and another for all foes. —     A boss rushat chapter 5, complete with mandatory grinding before the final boss.—     No postgameor side quests whatsoever, but the possibility to start a New Game + with yourlevel and money from the previous run.  And that’s the gist of it. Somehow, these two games manage to tick allclassic RPG boxes under three hours, and that’s quite a feat; cherry on thecake, they boast lovely nostalgia-inducing 8-bit-ish graphics and theme tracks,and they offer simple yet engaging stories. Combat is neatly balanced, and eachtitle sports its own unique party dynamic, which leads to game-specificstrategies. I’d say that Everdark Tower is easy in the beginning andtougher in the late stages, while Archlion Saga is the opposite. At anyrate, both games are totally worth playing, as they provide differentexperiences under a similar visual and aural coating.    I had a lovely time playing that pair, and I’ll certainly play themagain when I crave a grindy quickie. Trust Kemco to provide the very essence ofRPG in a pint-sized package! Talking about this, I finally caved in andpurchased all digital Kemco RPGs currently available on the Switch. That makesa whopping 20 titles, which will certainly be joined by others before the endof the Switch’s tenure; they’re all safely nested on a dedicated SD card, readyto be played at leisure. With that said, I’ll see you soon with my gaminginstinct’s next pick; in the meantime, dear fellow gamers, keep playing andtake care!"},
{"title": "Aokana: The Route Report (Spoilers!)", "date": "24/01/2021", "text": "Aokana’s route system isas straightforward as they go: forget about affection meter and hidden flags,landing on your desired route is determined by a single — and pretty obvious —dialogue choice. The common route comprises a whopping six chapters, while thegirls’ routes comprise two to three chapters; while this may seem a tadunbalanced, it actually works perfectly, as you get to know the whole crewbefore diving into romantic entanglements. I’ll lay down the routes in theorder I played them, which happens to be the order suggested by internetwisdom; without further ado, let’s get to it!  Rika Ichinose  Rika is the goody-two-shoes of the crew, a highly focused girl who works hard to improve her game; while that seriousness and dedication of herare commendable and would get her far IRL, they do little to improve her casein a gal game. She’s a complete stick-in-the-mud with — excuse my French — areal poker up her arse, a killjoy who takes everything literally and seemsaddicted to getting embarrassed and apologizing. Yet she’s also quite touchywith a bit of an angry streak, and she’s highly territorial when when it comesto FC. I’ll admit it: Rika is my least favourite girl by a very long shot.Her personality didn’t click with me at all, and her dull looks did little toimprove her case. Still, I have to admit that said dull looks are perfectlyconsistent with her serious personality, and commend the writers forintroducing such an unflashy character and sticking with her to the bitter end.She’s the perfect embodiment of the Japanese gaman, and I’m pretty sureshe has aficionados out there. As for me, I tried to focus on her story rather than on her looks andpersonality, and I ultimately enjoyed her route enough not to regret playingit. Sure, her story keeps in character by being the most uneventful of thebunch; still, it was heart-warming to see her get out of her comfort zone,learn that enjoyment and dedication can go hand in hand, and save herself andher childhood friend while remembering that FC is darn fun.   Mashiro ArisakaA.k.a. the resident tsundere. Tsunderes are usually not my cup of tea;but Mashiro is so zesty, cheeky and generally hilarious that she made it work.And of course, it also helps that she actually hides a much deeper, layered andnuanced personality under her tsundere coating. Her dedication to all thingsMisaki masks a desire to belong and an intense fear of being left stranded withnothing to hold dear; and it’s not long before the veneer cracks and sherealizes that my oh my, it’s not love that she’s feeling for her senpai.  Mashiro’s torturous relationship to FC can be summed up in four words:feeling like a fraud. She initially took on FC because of Misaki, yet ended uploving it in earnest; yet she remains quite average at it, while beingsurrounded by uber-talented people in the club. We can probably all relate tothat feel of being kinda out of place despite genuinely liking what we do —which is why it’s immensely pleasant to see Mashiro finally overcome herinsecurities and make peace with herself and her limited FC abilities.   Misaki Tobisawa All hail my favourite lady! Darn, Misaki Tobisawa is the sh*t. She’sfun, witty, quirky, and so similar to MC Masaya Hinata that she could basicallybe a female version of him. Not only that, but Masaya and her have a commonFC-related past, and learn to overcome their limitations and fears togetherwhile falling in love with each other. I swear, Misaki’s route totallyhas ‘canon’ written all over it. Yet that’s not all, folks. Misaki’s route fascinated me because ittouches on the deeply interesting and interwoven problematics of innate talent,improvement through hard work and fear of failing. Both Masaya and Misakicannot bear the thought of losing against FC players more talented thanthemselves; yet at the same time, they’re reluctant to work harder to improveand overcome their limitations. Claiming that they reached the natural limitsof their abilities and giving up on FC entirely is a convenient way ofprotecting their ego, while saving themselves the hassle of training and therisk of further failures. Yet that protection comes at the cost of theirpassion for FC itself; something’s ultimately got to give, and that somethingis (fortunately) their fear of failure. Shindo Kazunari shows them what inborntalent backed up by consistent training can do, and he becomes a model toemulate for Misaki and Masaya — and the reader as well.   Asuka KurashinaAsuka kinda has a tie with Misaki in my heart. I dig her infectiousgood mood and stubborn positivity, and her burning love for all things FC is socontagious that it makes me want to dive senseless into my own hobbies. Beyondall that, I’m fascinated by her monstrous innocence when it comes to FC.She’s the only player who can keep enjoying matches in the face of loss,cheating and physical abuse; that passion borders on a total lack of moral andlimits, and it makes her kinda terrifying in her fellow FC players’ eyes. Asfor me, I completely relate to that side of her: she’s a good sport with aconsuming passion, and that’s totally something I want to emulate IRL. Beyond offering a positive and highly loveable role model, Asuka’sroute explores the transformation of a sport — and by extension of any industry— as it slowly leaves the amateur sphere and reaches professional levels. SakiInui represents the frightening, fun-devoid side of professional practice: she’sall about winning, even if it means renouncing the very spirit of FC andeverything that makes it enjoyable. Asuka fortunately manages to overthrow her,and to expand FC competitive horizons through clever use of shoe settings whileshe’s at it; yet the threat of schism remains looming, as Irina is not quiteready to renounce her ‘true FC’. As a gamer who’s followed the evolutions of the gaming industry forthe past 30 years, I cannot help but spot similarities. Just like FC, gaming wasoriginally an amateur affair that was all about fun and experimenting, beforemorphing into a full-blown industry as it aged. Fun now has to share the stagewith business; yet as long as it endures, the essence of gaming will bepreserved.  Mai waifu!Aokana is much more thana mere romantic romp, and that’s what makes it so awesome. This is a deep andnuanced story about the levels of involvement in things we hold dear: beinggood but stiff, feeling not legit yet wanting to progress, being talented yet reluctantto work, being passionate and wanting to progress no matter what. I don’t havemuch more to ask for, really: just a mere fandisc that lets me romance mybeloved Reiko Satouin, a.k.a. the girl that should totally have been a romanticoption in lieu of Rika Ichinose. With that said, I’ll see you soon with my newgame of the week, dear fellow gamers; in the meantime, keep playing and takecare!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire: My thoughts exactly", "date": "19/01/2021", "text": "Back in my Delcatty run report, I promised to expand upon my feelingsabout Gen VI Hoenn. These feelings could be summed up in three words: it'scomplicated. On one hand, I really love how revamped Hoenn feels like abrand-new region while retaining Gen III's specificities, from the geometriclook of rocky areas to the sheer wilderness of the whole region. I absolutelyadore the quality-of-life improvements offered by the second screen features —starting with the map, which allowed me to fully undertand at long last theexact layout of the aquatic routes. Speaking of which, the aquatic routes andunderwater areas look breathtakingly gorgeous in ORAS — so much so thatI explored them all just for the sheer pleasure of it.   On the other hand, I just cannot get over how utterly sluggish theseremakes are. I felt like I was walking through mud my whole run: as much as Itried to speed things up, I could never generate that sweet, intoxicatingfeeling of rush I like to get from my solo runs. I reckon this is due to anunfortunate combination of factors, including the long battle intros, theoversized areas and the many cutscenes and interruptions. This doesn't make thegame unpleasant, mind you; just supremely slow. Well, I guess that's adifferent experience, to be enjoyed for what it is; I'll definitely go for ORASwhen I want a chill, mellow solo run.   Another annoying thing is the nerfing of the Zigzagoon line, whichmakes the Pickup hack much more difficult to pull off than in Ruby/Sapphire.For once, the line now has Gluttony as well as Pickup, forcing you to filteryour recruits; for another, levels now affect pickup items and rates. AZigzagoon/Linoone now cannot reap Rare Candies at all under Lv. 20, and onlyhas a 4% chance of doing so betwen Lv. 20 and 40; compare that to the 10% ratefrom Lv. 1 in RS, and you'll see why I'm severely miffed. On the otherhand, Gen VI gives you the Lucky Egg much more readily, so this compensatesthat. I've played both Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire at thatpoint; and I solemnly declare that Alpha Sapphire will be my go-to halfof the pair, from now on and for all eternity, for reasons utterly futile yetvery important to yours truly. For once, I fancy blue more than red as acolour, and the blue palette during battle reminds me nicely of Ecco theDolphin; for another, I like Team Aqua's looks and outfits better than TeamMagma's; and, last but not least, SHELLY! Gosh, I could stare at her all runlong. Thank Arceus GameFreak didn't give her the Samus treatment by changing heroriginal curly red mop into a vanilla blonde ponytail, and went for a wholemass of dark wavy (how suitable) hair instead.  Well, that's it for my thoughts about revamped Hoenn. The fact that Ihad yet to put ORAS to the test was kinda nagging at me, and I'm glad tohave them under my belt at long last. Now I just have to dive senseless into Sword&Shield,and I'll be up to date when it comes to the main series. For now, dear fellowgamers, I'll see you soon with my next Poke-report; in the meantime, keepplaying and take care!"},
{"title": "Aokana - Four Rhythms Across the Blue: Super wholesome", "date": "15/01/2021", "text": "I’m notcompletely done with VNs yet — all the less so as I’m going through an uber-busy patch IRL, withlittle to no energy to pour into complicated RPGs. Things should settle soonenough; but in the meantime, I’m gonna polish off a couple of VNs, startingwith Aokana.    Since Ialso have little to no time to write, I’m gonna cut to the chase: Aokanais an absolute gem of a VN, full to the brim with loveliness and wholesomeness.Not only is the in-game art a million times better than the cover art, but theartistic team managed to pull off the impossible: to tell a highly dynamicstory about a high-velocity aerial sport through screenshots, and to do so in avery convincing and engrossing way. I won’t go into details about the clevertricks used to achieve that feat, from SFX to camera scrolling to movementlines; suffice it to say that they are a great many, and that they do the deedperfectly. To crown that festival of goodness, the OST is absolutely stellar,with a crap ton of tracks that all manage to fit the mood perfectly. I don’tthink I’ve ever played a VN with that many musical themes, and they’re all soexcellent that I’m seriously itching to import the OST.     Aokana’s production values are top-tier indeed; but a VN lives and dies byits story, and Aokana doesn’t have to worry about the latter. It offersone of the most impossibly wholesome stories I’ve ever had the joy of playing,a story that’s both adorable and riveting. It also stars one of the mostloveable cast I’ve ever had the pleasure of rooting for, a cast you just cannothelp but love to pieces. Now, it wasn’t long before I learnt that Aokanawas originally an adult VN rife with steamy scenes — that is, before it was made safe for workupon reaching our shores. Dare I say that I have mixed feelings about that choice, and that I kinda regret not being madeprivy to the crew’s intimate activities? Yup, I’ll say it. I’m not especially afan of adult VNs, especially adult VNs involving protagonists that are barelyadults; but in the case of Aokana, I strongly feel that steamy sceneswould only have crowned the game’s wholesomeness and made the story absolutelyperfect. It would have been the cherry on the cake, a way to emphasize that onecan have everything in life — the competition thrill, the friendship, thelovey-dovey cuteness and the red-hot lust.  Still, Aokana is awesome as it is, and I totally encourage allmy fellow VN fans to play it. It rekindled the youngish enthusiasm I used tofeel when reading shonens 20 years ago, and have not felt for nearly as long;if it had this effect on jaded old me, then I’m confident it can have thiseffect on everyone. I’ll see you soon with a run report, dear fellow gamers; inthe meantime, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon: Nice little crawly treat", "date": "10/01/2021", "text": "Let’s start with a double disclaimer, dear fellow gamers: first, I’llspare us that game's full title; and secondly, that same game will be referred to as‘DanMachi’ from now on, because even its acronym would be too darn long. Withthat said, let’s talk about DanMachi, shall we?  I actually have to insert a third disclaimer here: until I was halfwayinto DanMachi, I didn’t know it was part of wider franchise. Based onits title alone, I thought DanMachi would be a VN with bits of dungeoncrawling and dating sim elements; and it turned out to be a dungeon crawlerwith chunks of story in-between dungeons and a dating feature as a postgametreat. That sounds close enough to my expectations; and yet, it’s actuallyquite far from them. For once, I expected the dating element to be part andparcel of the main game; for another, I expected the story to beself-sufficient. Alas, it’s not: not only is it very poorly told, but itblatantly assumes that the reader is already familiar with the DanMachilore. This is a tie-in game through and through, made for — and by — DanMachiaficionados.   Now, was I disappointed by that turn of events? Not in the slightest,dear fellow gamers. A VN with bits of crawling would have been fine, but adungeon crawler with bits of story is even finer. And heck, that’s some mightyfine dungeon crawling we have here, with stellar ARPG physics, loot bythe truckload and convenient stat customization. That being said, I’m not gonna lie: thisis totally Baby’s first ARPG. Tiny dungeons, few pieces of gear, limitedcustomization and a whopping two skills per character: this is the bare minimumas far as the genre goes, and it might be seen as a complete rip-off or as arefreshing return to basics. Being the complete ARPG whore I am, Iobviously went for the latter; and greatly enjoyed the 10-or-so hours I spentslicing stuff in DanMachi’s dungeons.  All in all, DanMachi was a nice surprise. It wasn’t what Iexpected, but it turned out to be something just as good, if not better. Itprovided me with a nice variety of dungeon missions, while remaining shortenough not to tire me; I’ll definitely get back to it when I want to indulge ina short 'n' sweet hack’n’slashy dungeon crawler.

As I alreadylaid down my gaming plans for 2021, let me instead present you with the secondpart of my very own gaming epopee. We parted on a cliffhanger, and it is timeto end the suspense. Enjoy!   2000 - 2006: The Days of Emulation After the Sega drowning fiasco, I entered the new millennium bereft ofgaming systems; and it wasn’t long before I found out that none of the current consoles fitted my playing needs and wants. See, what I wanted at thetime were pixels, vivid colours and lovely, wholesome brand-new games. The GameBoy Color was reaching the end of its life and couldn’t provide the latter, andneither could the agonizing Dreamcast. As for Sony, I hated them withsuch a passion for flooding the gaming landscape of the late ‘90s withpolygons, shitty shades of brown and disturbing games that the mere though ofowning one of their systems was anathema. To my utter dismay, I was leftstranded with no console to call my own; and as neither retro gaming norinternet shopping were yet a thing, I couldn’t even secure another trustyMegadrive or a Super Nintendo. This was the beginning of the longest dry spell of my gaming career. Those days were dark, let me tell you that;my forced parting from regular gaming was painful indeed, and left me withintense feelings of loss and frustration. I wouldn’t get over these feelingsuntil a whole decade later; in the meantime, I tried to alleviate my loss andmaintain an ever-so-tenuous connection to gaming by diving into the buddingemulation scene. I secured all my favourite cult classics on my desktop, andproceeded to replay them on a regular basis for the next five years. An annualsummer gaming marathon with gallons of green tea by my side was mandatory, aswell as several smaller spells all through the year.   Still, this wasn’t enough. I needed some new gaming material aswell; and I quenched my thirst by spending long, delightful hours watching mysister play the Tomb Raider games on her laptop. We all know thatwatching someone play can sometimes be as fulfilling as playing ourselves, allthe more so if the player in question masters the game more than we do. Indeed,I totally suck at all things Tomb Raider, while my sistermade Lara Croft her b*tch long ago; and boy, did I get a kick out of seeing herblaze effortlessly through the games. While she was getting engrossed intocollecting Universal Fighting System cards, I discovered the SamuraiShowdown series on a Neo Geo emulator, and played the heck out of SamuraiShodown IV — to the point where I managed to make mincemeat of final bossShiro Amakusa with all characters, in all settings. 2007 – 2011: Coming back on track After six years of that regimen, I was seriously itching to play newgames. Not just any new games, mind you: RPGs, folks. Having to survivefor six years on Landstalker and Link’s Awakening alone made mecrave new adventures like crazy — and lo and behold, the Game Boy Advance, theDS and their meaty RPG library were right there to humour me. But at thatpoint, I was so disconnected from gaming trends that I didn’t even think ofchecking the current pieces of kit. Emulation had become my one and only way toplay, for better or for worse; and thus I missed on those amazing handheldsentirely. I would fix that oversight later, as you all know; but in themeantime, I turned to emulation once again to unearth RPGs. First to quench mythirst was the mind-blowing Terranigma, soon followed by other cultclassics such as Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 3, Illusionof Time and A Link to the Past.     As I indulged in these RPG gems, my desire to own a dedicated gamingsystem grew stronger by the year, until it culminated in 2011. I toyed with theidea of making my gaming comeback with the DS: I had handled it some time agoat my cousins’ place and utterly relished the feel of it in my hands. Iconveniently used Amazon and its fiendish ‘You might also like’ feature to findDS RPGs, and it wasn’t long before I had a list of potential purchases — andthat sealed the deal. The rest is history: the most glorious Second Coming of Gaming finally happened in Christmas 2011, making me a full-blowngamer again.  2012 - 2020: The Halcyon Days  Youkinda know the story from there on, dear fellow gamers: I’ve invested in otherhandhelds, I’ve become a full-blown collector, and I’ve played with abandon andnever spent more than two months away from D-pads since then. Most importantly,I am at long last completely and utterly happy as a gamer. Until 2011,the joy of gaming always came with a healthy dose of frustration: either Ididn’t have the funds to purchase coveted games, or I couldn’t find thosecoveted games, or there were no consoles or games I fancied — heck, there was alwaysa killjoy. Those bittersweet days are done: I’m now the proud owner of sixhandhelds and hundreds of RPGs, I’m always a mere click away from getting a newaddition to my precious collection, and I’m basking in the joy of gaming likenever before. I’m truly living my Halcyon Days of Gaming, and I pray thatthey’ll last long — hopefully as long as yours truly.  Hereends my gaming epopee — boy, what a ride that was! Those 30 years of gaming were amazingindeed, and it felt good to reminisce and see how far I’ve come since I firstlaid my thumb on an A-button.

{"title": "1990 – 2020: 30 Years of Gaming (Part 1)", "date": "25/12/2020", "text": "Merry Christmas, dear fellow gamers! I hope you’re enjoying delightfulmoments with your loved ones and gorging on delicious food. My own Christmas2020 is very special, as it marks the 30th Anniversary of my first genuineforay into gaming. Three decades of gaming, folks! This is a highly meaningfulmilestone indeed, and I decided to celebrate it by looking back on my wholegaming career. Make yourselves comfortable and bring the popcorn, dear fellowgamers: this is the epic, convoluted and ultimately happy-ending story of myvery own gaming journey. Christmas 1990: The GenesisLet's set the scene: back in late 1990, I was nine years old, andvideo games were not a fixture in my life by any stretch of the imagination.Sure, I wasn't a complete video game virgin either: I had owned twoGames&Watches already, as well as dabbled in a Space Invaders cloneon my father's Macintosh 128 K; but this was nothing compared to thestorm that was about to descend on my young life. That storm was unleashed by none other than my neighbour: thatinsanely lucky kid had gotten a brand-new Game Boy upon release, andimmediately proceeded to show it (off) to the whole neighbourhood. My sisterand I were instantly mesmerized; we just couldn't take our eyes off that GameBoy's screen, even though said screen only had primitive early GB titles suchas Tetris and Prince of Persia to boast. The next step wasobvious enough: to run to our parents and beg for Game Boys as Christmas gifts.Upon seeing the price of the thing, my father was not exactly enthusiastic;however, we were so adamant that he finally relented — under the strictcondition that we would participate by investing whatever pocket money we hadin our piggy banks into that new toy. We gladly accepted; and three monthslater, we had our shiny new Game Boys — one for each of us. Oh, the joy!  1991 - 1995: A Whole New World I had no intention to stay long on a Tetris diet; and so, Iproceeded to expand my game library as soon as I had enough pocket money saved.One single GB game amounted to five months of allowance; needless to say,careful choice was required if I didn’t want to be stuck with a turd for monthson end. A fateful visit to the local toy shop later, I was the proud owner of SuperMario Land; that was the beginning of both my collecting career and acouple of months of torturous play, which I already retraced here. An expansionof my collection was required; after another couple of months and diligentsavings, my budding collection boasted Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle andDucktales, which quickly became little darlings of mine. Then came the ultimate cult classic Link’s Awakening, whichgave me my first intense emotions as a gamer; Kirby’s Dream Land, whichI borrowed from a schoolmate and loved so much that I ended up purchasing it; Tom&Jerry,which my cousin gave me because he hated it; Mr Nutz, a European GBclassic that temporarily reconciled me with Platformers; Star Wars,which was tough as nails and an overall disappointment to the Star Wars fanI was; and a couple of others borrowed here and there. I would have owned manymore titles if I could have; alas, I was limited by both a lack of personalfunds and a lack of purchasing options in my little town. I remember dreamingthat I went to the local toy shop, only to find all current games butthe one I wanted to purchase — jeez, I was kinda obsessed, wasn’t I? Those GB years were amazing indeed. But gamers, especially young ones,are fickle creatures; and after five years of an exclusive GB diet, I was eagerto try new systems — preferably new systems boasting non-monochrome screens. Atepid experience with a turd named Titus the Fox was the last straw thatprompted me to ditch my GB for good; and after selling it to a schoolmate, Iwas ready to move on to the next stage of my gaming career.  1996 - 1999: Lust for GamesNot only did I move from spinach-green non-lit screens to full-colourbacklit ones, but I also changed sides in the ‘90s console wars by moving on toSega machines. I started with the Game Gear, which nobody wanted anymore in1996; games were dirt cheap as a result, and I could splurge on brand-newcartridges and build up a nice little collection. Sonic, the LionKing, Ecco the Dolphin, Tail’s Adventure, Ristar, Landof Illusion, The Excellent Dizzy Collection, Sonic Triple Trouble,Sonic Drift Racing: I got them all, and I could have gotten even more ifnot for the Game Gear being discontinued in 1997. As Game Gear gamesdisappeared from shops seemingly overnight, I used the opportunity to move onto home consoles by purchasing a second-hand Megadrive in a local pawn shop. Ihad tried and tested the thing already by indulging in Streets of Rageand Sonic sessions at my neighbour’s place — obviously, those were thefirst games I purchased for my lovely Megadrive.I didn’t know it at the time, but that Megadrive would be the onlyhome console I’d ever own. But boy, did it leave a deep imprint indeed: I spenthours toiling on the Ecco games, I polished off Landstalkera million times, I kicked hundreds of arses in Streets of Rage in co-opwith my sister; and last but not least, I became a Sonic whore likenever before. Oh, those lovely winter afternoons playing Sonic3&Knuckles with my sister expertly handling Tails! Alas, my Sega days were bound to end in a bittersweet and anticlimacticway. As the millennium was drawing to a close, I stored my Megadrive and GameGear under my bed right before the holidays, thinking they would be safe there.Little did I know that a pipe would explode in the family home during thosefateful holidays, drowning the whole place in 20 cm of water and destroying myprecious consoles.Another entirely different phase would take place after that; I’lltell you all about it, and more, in the second half of my gaming epopee. Untilthen, dear fellow gamers, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Café Enchanté: The Route Report (SPOILERS!)", "date": "21/12/2020", "text": "Man, I really need a catharsis after playing that game; and that run report will be exactly that. Here, I can expand on everything that shook and shocked me and made Café Enchanté the rollercoaster of emotions it turned out to be. I'll lay down the Routes in the order I played them; without further ado, let's get to it!   Canus EspadaWell, colour me surprised: I sure as heck didn't expect Canus' route to be the sweetest and more wholesome of the bunch. Both Canus and Kotone are better off together than they were on their own: Canus is free from his burdensome fate, Kotone made precious new friends, and both are in love and gained a second country to call their own. What more can you ask for? Well, maybe a darn head for Canus? I swear, that route would have been perfect if only the man didn't look like he had an unfortunate encounter with a guillotine. As it is, it remains a bit off-putting, even though the game implies that Kotone can see a bit of Canus' face after her interaction with the World Tree. For once, no head means no kissing scene, which is disappointing in an otome; for another, one can picture all sorts of freaky scenes under the sheets, which kinda soils the wholesomeness of the route. Oh, well; this is still one of my favourite routes, and it would certainly be my absolute favourite if Canus had a head on his shoulders.   Ignis CarbunculusI really liked the fact that Ignis dropped the tsundere act so early in his route, revealing his more complex personality in the process. What I didn't like much, on the other hand, was the psychological torture he had to endure for most of said route. Learning that he slaughtered his whole village back in the day and that the guy he saw as a little brother was actually a traitor was bad enough already; so pray tell, was it really necessary to have him also literally feast on Kotone and endure an excruciating episode of mental torture in a prison cell? I swear, that avalanche of nastiness became seriously unsettling after a while. That aside, the All-Devouring Wolf God theme was pretty interesting, and reminded me nicely of my beloved Raging Loop; and Ignis ultimately ends up in a better place, making all the angst somehow worth it.   Kaoru Rindo Rindo being a sexy beast and the only human beau, I fully expected a steamy romp that would give Kotone some much-needed sense of normality — and boy, how utterly wrong I was. Rindo's route ends up being deeply disturbing, as it veers towards body horror in a most unexpected and brutal way. The 'loss of humanity' theme running throught the route brought back unfortunate memories of the Mitty/Nanami arc in Made in Abyss, and that's really not something I wanted to remember — more like I'd erase it entirely from my memory if I could. Not only that, but Rindo ends up worse off that he was on his own: his beloved sister's dead, and he became a non-human. Sure, he has Kotone now; but one can seriously wonder if the trade-off was really worth it. I'll admit it: I didn't get much from Rindo's route beyond a deep uneasiness and a heart-stabbing sadness. That route's only saving grace was Akira Mikado, who ditches his cliché mad scientist guise to reveal his immense fortitude, kindness and patience — and ends up being really touching and mesmerizing doing so. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if the guy were made romance material in a future fandisc.   Il Fado de RieThe Kaori Yuki vibes are strong with this one, and I felt like I was reading an Angel Sanctuary fanfic through and through. It's not just the angel motif; from the sadistic god to the torture of angels, without forgetting the ban on love and emotions and the whole fallen angel shebang, that route's overall themes could have been lifted straight from Angel Santuary. Not that it's a bad thing, mind you; it just made Il's route a tad boring for me, as I was already familiar with all those leitmotifs. Still, there was more than enough shock value to keep me on my toes: Il's extreme deshumanization was genuinely harrowing, and the plot twist was truly genius, as it gave a totally new perspective on the whole story. Watching Il (re)learn to feel emotions was truly touching — heck, you know I'm total a sucker for the whole 'learning to feel and be human' shebang. And my, was it lovely indeed to be treated to a happy ending after all these struggles.   Misyr RexOh boy, oh boy. Where do I start with this one? This is the real deal, folks. Misyr's route is (very blatantly) the one and only canon route, and it runs the gamut of the CE mindf*ck: from angst to body horror to fates worse than death, it gives you everything — and it pulls no punches. I'll say it: the things Misyr and Noah went through are absolutely bone-chilling. The discovery of their fate stirred strong and unknown emotions deep within me; I seriously feel that my very soul has been touched, and I can safely claim that I've never, ever been struck so vividly by a narrative development in a otome. This is absolutely on par with terrifying classics such as I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream — heck, it's actually a textbook, perfect And I Must Scream! And don't get me started on Kotone's ultimate fate, which is truly horrifying yet unexplicably manages to retain a modicum of sweetness and wholesomeness. How on earth did the writers pull that off? I swear, Misyr's route will go down in my personal history not only as one of the most chillingly memorable otome routes I've ever played, but also as one of the most haunting fantasy stories I've ever read.   With that said, here's the thing, dear fellow gamers: while CE's overall story is splendid and truly a masterpiece, CE's routes kinda fail on the romantic front. The issue here is that far from improving everybody's lives as you'd expect, Kotone getting closer to the beaus always results in appalling events, for both her beau du jour and herself. Even Canus' route, which is by far the most mellow, has its fair share of angst, betrayal and body horror before everything is settled. It's nearly like the game is advising strongly against relationships between human and non-humans; and knowing the overall Japanese stance on binational relationships, I wouldn't be surprised if the Otomate writers had indeed wanted to convey a not-so subliminal message on the matter. At any rate, the romance in CE is so contrived and painful that it certainly doesn't feel fulfilling; the overall story, on the other hand, is the stuff cult classics are made of. With that said, I'll see you soon with yet another VN report, dear fellow gamers; in the meantime, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Café Enchanté: Baby, don't hurt me no more", "date": "19/12/2020", "text": "I hesitated between this title and \"Don't phunk with my heart\"; but really, the meaning is the same, namely that Café Enchanté roughed me up and tore my heart apart like few otomes before it. That game is savage; and it's all the more savage as it masquerades as something light-hearted when it's actually anything but.   Here's what I, and probably many other players, expected from CE: a sweet, cheerful, possibly slighty corny romp about coffee shop regulars. I also expected an strong fan-servicey factor due to the presence of non-human beaus, as well as some crossover fanfic vibes. Last but not least, I expected to be given long lectures about coffee and latte art as eye-candy. What I got instead was a brooding and meditative saga about Darwinism and the hardships of binational love, replete with copious amounts of angst, body horror and fates worse than death. And forget about coffee lectures and latte art; instead, I got a taste of other worlds so utterly foreign and unwelcoming that they made shivers run down my spine.   I sure as heck didn't expect CE to be so utterly brutal, which made its impact all the more violent. But make no mistake, dear fellow gamers: I absolutely adored that game. For all its brutality, the story is undeniably top-tier; and it's backed up by splendid Art Deco-inspired background art, gorgeous character designs and a lush, evocative soundtrack. The interface is stupidly enchanting (indeed), and the french sentences sprinkled through the game are all delightfully right when it comes to grammar and choice of vocabulary — I swear, they are totally things a native could say. Not only that, but the writers went as far as to play upon the double meaning of the word enchanté in French. As a character points out, it means 'delighted to meet you'; but it also means 'enchanted', which nicely ties with the game's overall theme — now that's a linguistic coup de maître if I ever saw one.   Long story short: Café Enchanté is one of Otomate's most outstanding efforts, and it fully deserves to be played. Just know what to expect, brace yourself, and take breaks if need be — heck, I took a two-day pause myself before playing the last route, just to breathe and recover from all the messing up before the final push. I'll see you soon with a route report, dear fellow gamers; in the meantime, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Robotics;Notes Double Pack: Unpolished but sweet", "date": "15/12/2020", "text": "I have this complicated relationship with the Science Adventure VNs. Saying I love the series would be an exaggeration, but saying I hate it would be as well. The truth is that between both swings my heart, as the French say; and so, I continue playing its entries in the hope of finding THE game that I'll either fully love or hate.That game won't be RNDP, that's for sure. I could have hated it, mind you: of all the Science Adventure titles I've played, this is by far the most half-baked. First thing first, I must comment on the utter silliness ill-inspired choice of telling a story about giant robots involving epic fights with a limited budget: something's obviously got to give, and that something is said epic fights, which suffer from a serious case of 'Tell, don't show'. On the graphic front, the digitized character models look wooden as heck, and sorely lack the charm and warmth of good ole hand-drawn ones; and the rather dull background art only makes matters worse. The route triggers are infuriatingly hard to pinpoint in Elite, forcing me to run straight to an FAQ; they're easier to figure out in DaSH, but — too little to late, alas. Then you have the annoyingly grandiose and arcane chapter titles, which teeter the fine line between cleverness and silliness — typical Science Adventure fare, I'd say. And pray tell, why are the Elite QTR sequences such a snoozefest? They don't pack an ounce of challenge, and might as well not have been there for all they bring to the game. Despite that long list of flaws, I had a really sweet time with RNDP, and most especially with DaSH — confirming that we do indeed have a pattern of yours truly loving VN sequels more than original games. Not only does the awesome Itaru Hashida join the fray in DaSH, but many characters that annoyed me as heck in Elite are granted some lovely character development. Cherry on the cake, the tone is deliciously humourous and light-hearted this time around, and there's a plethora of gorgeous hand-drawn CGs. Also: Frau Koujiro is totes my waifu!!! Gee, I friggin' love that girl. As far as perverted ladies with their mind in the gutter go, Asano in OWIE was a nice specimen already; but boy, does Frau crank the hentai factor up to eleven. To shove a hardcore fujoshi into a gal game was a very bold move indeed, and I can only commend Chiyomaru Shikura for taking up the gauntlet on that one. And since I'm mentioning this, we do indeed have a new inclusive trend when it comes to fanservice in games: many VNs and niche RPGs I've played these last ten years offer shotacon/lolicon and yaoi fan service on top of the usual tits&arse. I'd dub that the Three-Course Fanservice Menu; and I'm really glad it's all the rage these days, as it keeps fan service nicely fresh and varied. Not sure it's the French gourmet or the hentai lover in me speaking on this one; but the more fanservice for everyone, the merrier! And with those words, my praise of RNDP comes to an end — but not my VN roll, as my VN itch has not yet been thoroughly scratched. I'll see you soon with my next run report, dear fellow gamers; in the meantime, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Our World Is Ended: I just love it", "date": "12/12/2020", "text": "I'll admit it: I went into that game expecting the absolute worst. Most reviews lambasted the horrendous fan service, with some writing off OWIE entirely because of it. Still, there was no way I was gonna miss a VN with such vibrant chara design and vivid colours — hence the stance I took: to turn a blind eye to the fan-service and keep playing good-naturedly. As I did that, something mightily unexpected happened: I grew intensely attached to OWIE's motley crew. Sure, they are darn irritating at first, with their behaviour that's way too cliché and their private jokes that are spammed way too often; yet after a few chapters, I found myself caring about them and worrying about their destiny in earnest. In that sense, what happens at Judgement 7's is very similar to what happens in real workplaces, where you're annoyed by your colleagues' quirks at first yet end up being really attached to them. Those teammates of mine provided me with a rollercoaster of emotions: I laughed at Ikura's grand declarations and Asano's old man behaviour, rolled my eyes at Natsumi's tsundere antics and Sekai's hentai ones, teared up in earnest when Natsumi confronted Yuno after the latter's past was revealed, and let out a satisfied sigh at the final outcome.   Cherry on the cake, the fan service wasn't even that horrendous. Sure, it's pretty heavy-duty at first, and seriously crass to boot; but it's not long before it receeds into the background and lets the story take center stage. Not only that, but I daresay it's quite decent as far as fan service goes, because there's something for everybody: after delivering a healthy dose of tits&arse, the game moves on to shotacon, then dives straight into yaoi. Unfortunately, many players may be so put off by the initial bombarding of over-the-top, breast-focused lewdness that they'll give up long before the story gets to shine and the fan service changes gear. That would be kinda ironic, 'cause they'd do exactly what they blame the game for doing: focusing only on outer appearances, and ignoring the heart of gold that beats under all the bosom display.   This game has its heart in the right place indeed, and it surprised me with many Persona-like stories of psychological struggles. Each character gets their dedicated time under the spotlight, and their own private issues are pleasantly varied when it comes to depth and intensity. After all, not everybody can have a gruesome past, right? (SPOILERS!) The drama and anxiety factor runs the gamut: from pretty light with Iruka, who uses the products of his overactive imagination to embellish his often disappointing reality, to cranked up to eleven in Yuno's story of bullying, depression and suicide attempt. Then you have Sekai who unwinds and deals with loneliness through crazy hentai fantasies, Tatiana who suffers from being valued only as a genius child, Asano who turned to shotacon because she's afraid of adult men, Natsumi who can't accept her weak and flawed self, and Reina who has trouble processing her own death and renouncing Judgement 7. Even the player, as the MC, will have to go through a psychological journey of sorts — from being a passive, somewhat reluctant spectator to being deeply involved in the whole crew's destiny. (END OF SPOILERS)I played the mandatory normal end, as well as Iruka's bromance end; others will have to wait until next run — because there will indeed be a next run! Gee, I love that game too much not to replay it one day. And now, I'll move on the next VN in line — because indeed, I'm still totally on a VN roll. Until my next run report, dear fellow gamers, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Raging Loop: Oh what a ride", "date": "09/12/2020", "text": "Well, my beloved Kemco never ceases to amaze me. I knew they could do Platformers and RPGs; but Visual Novels as well? Now that's a surprise — and a good one at that. Just a couple more lovely surprises from them, and they'll definitely join my Favourite Developers Ever Shortlist!Until they're granted that honour, let's focus on Raging Loop, shall we? I'll admit it: I was not impressed at first. RL was originally released on Android and iOS; and well, it kinda shows. With heavy reliance on text rather than pictures and a serious case of 'Tell, don't show', that game just screams budget — or lack thereof. Here are a couple of such 'Tell, don't show' screenshots that are so extreme it's nearly laughable:   I was rolling my eyes and snickering at first; but it didn't take long before I realized that for all its cheapness, RL was actually an awesome VN. That game is a true labour of love: you can totally feel that Kemco really did their absolute best with whatever limited budget they had, and it's really heartwarming. And my, did they indeed sublimate that limited budget into an engrossing, gripping, fascinating gem of a VN. RL is the real deal: a genuine choose-your-own-adventure experience that has you slowly descending into horror and madness. Add to this an excellent soundtrack, spot-on SFX and stellar voice acting, and you get an harrowing yet riveting package that I just couldn't drop until the very end.   Talking about the end, well... Dare I say I was disappointed upon discovering it? Yup, I'll say it. The narrative side left me unsated; however, your mileage may vary on that one. (SPOILERS!) See, the main issue I have with RL's outcome is the fact that seemingly paranormal occurrences are ultimately explained by the existence of an elaborate setup. This is akin to learning the workings behind a magic trick, and I find this painfully anticlimactic. It's all the more regrettable as the story does retain a number of supernatural elements, and heavy ones at that; going supernatural all the way couldn't have hurt that much, could it? Oh, well; whatever floats your boat, Kemco. I still love ya, y'know. (END OF SPOILERS) Beyond the narrative itself, I was disappointed simply because witnessing the ending couldn't compare to the sheer joy of navigating the story. RL is a most glorious case of the journey mattering more than the destination; and I'm pretty sure that any ending, no matter how stellar it was, would have been a letdown by sheer virtue of putting an end to that thrilling ride.   Underwhelming ending aside, I have a serious issue with the game's localization. In a VN so heavily reliant on text, translation has to be flawless; alas, RL's translation is anything but. Apart from the occasional clumsy wording, some key terms and concepts are not nearly explicited enough, forcing the reader to connect the dots themselves. I'm pretty sure I didn't fully grasp some plot points due to the poor translation, and this is nothing short of a capital sin as far as VNs are concerned. On top of that, the usual 'Lost in translation' issue is painfully blatant in RL. I'll quote the most glaring example: \"kami\" being translated as \"god\". It's pretty obvious that the game's 'kami' is supposed to refer to a wide range of phenomenons that all fall under the 'spirit that inhabits an inanimate object' umbrella; alas, the word 'god' in its western acception cannot convey that richness of meaning, forcing the reader to redefine it on the fly.   Still, I had an awesome time playing RL. And mind you, that awesome time could have been even longer: there is a neat New Game Plus feature that adds new scenes to nearly every chapter, giving you the perfect incentive to replay the whole game. I kept that treat for next run, though; replay value in a VN is rare and precious enough to be preserved at all costs, and other VNs are waiting in line. Until I meet you again with my gaming instinct's next pick, dear fellow gamers, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Kotodama - The 7 Mysteries of Fujisawa: Fun but dispensable", "date": "05/12/2020", "text": "The title says it all, really. Kotodama is a cute and fun little game that offered me a couple of lovely playing hours; and yet, I forgot it as soon as the cartridge was out of my Switch, and I could totally have lived without ever touching it. Heck, it left so little imprint on my gamer's soul that I actually have trouble finding something to write about it! If I had to find one word to sum up that game, it would be 'half-baked'. There's some potential in all areas, but that potential is mostly squandered through lazy and/or uninspired design decisions. Like, why is the perfectly decent story ultimately full of loose ends? Maybe there's a sequel in the pipelines; but that's no excuse to butcher Kotodama's main story. Why doesn't Satsuki Kujo have a secret of his own despite being one of the seven main teenage characters? Seven mysteries for seven characters would be perfect, wouldn't it? Well, the developers obviously thought otherwise. Why do nameless characters have faces for a change, yet look so much creepier and freakier than your usual faceless VN grunts? Jeez, I think I prefer blank face models after all. Last but not least, why is the resident puzzle game so shockingly simplistic? I'm no expert in that field; but even I can see that any free puzzle game is ten times deeper and more complex than Kotodama's barebones take on Candy Crush.   And that's not all, folks: the production values are crappy as heck (coming from Piofiore, this was really a shock for my retinas), the soundtrack is quite forgettable and the art style is utterly vanilla. But there is worse: to hide the fact that Kotodama is really a very short game, the developers injected it with a copious amount of fake longevity. Once you've gone through the story once and landed a totally unskippable bad end, you're faced with a crap ton of minute key dialogue choices. And let me tell you: while there is little to no leeway regarding the right, good-end-delivering choices, most of those choices are so prosaic and pedestrian that there are no clues whatsoever to guide you. Here's an example: as you meet one of the seven main characters for the first time, you're given the choice between \"Hi, I'm MC\" and \"You like animals?\". Only one answer will lead to the good end; but good luck figuring it out. Let's face it: most of the 'right' choices are completely random, and exist solely to make you play longer than you should.   Reading all this, you'd think that I totally hated Kotodama's guts; and yet, as I mentioned earlier, I had a really good time playing it. Despite its many flaws, Kotodama ultimately oozes a pleasant and heartwarming atmosphere; it's a zesty little game that doesn't take itself too seriously and cheerfully pokes fun at VN and fan-service tropes. Since I mention this, I was genuinely surprised to see the indignation generated by Kotodama's fan-servicey bits: while I saw these as innocuous and more humorous than lewd, many reviewers saw them as utterly filthy. To each their own, I guess; suffice to say that I was not bothered in the least by the stripping sequences — all the less so as my eyes were usually glued to the grid.   Well; looks like I finally managed to write something about Kotodama, now didn't I? I'm honestly not sure I'll ever touch that game again; but it will go down in my gaming history as a pleasurable experience. Now, do I recommend it? Not quite. Unless you're a hardcore VN aficionado, want to own every VN ever released or harbour an extreme Japanese school life fetish, there's really no reason to own that particular game. On the other hand, I liked it despite being none of these things, so... Well, it's up to you and your own gaming instinct, I guess. With that said, I'll see you soon with my gaming instinct's freshest catch, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Gaming 2021: A Blueprint", "date": "29/11/2020", "text": "Hello there, dear fellow gamers! As that most rocky year 2020 is drawing to a close, I hope you're doing fine, in gaming as well as in life. 2021 will hopefully bring better things on all fronts; but since we're talking about games here, I'm gonna focus on my gaming plans for that upcoming year. And let me tell you: there are mighty changes ahead, oh yes precious. Here's the situation in a nutshell: after a few years of general quietness and uneventfulness, my life has picked up the pace and is now busy as heck. Concurrently, my beloved game collection is larger than ever, and still growing by the month. I'm no math buff; but even I can plainly see that things are not going to add up. Something's got to give: and that something is the average time I spend on any given game.This neatly squares with another recurrent issue of mine, which is none other than Long RPG Run Fatigue. While I tend to favour short and sweet RPGs, the current gaming scene is in no mood to humour me: the general consensus seems to be that 50 hours of play is a bare minimum, and that any RPG that offers less should cower away in shame. You know I can pour 50 hours into a game if I love it, dear fellow gamers; but you also know that I much prefer to keep it at 15 hours and move on to my gaming instinct's next pick. And so, here's my plan: starting 2021, I'm going to operate on a 'One Week, One Game' basis. What I formally dubbed the OWOG system will be pretty simple: each week, I'll choose a game, play it as much as I can or want during that week, blog about it, and then put it back into its case when the week is over — rinse and repeat. If I cleared the game by that time, good for me; if the last boss is still prancing around, it'll just have to wait until next round. This system will keep my gaming nicely fresh and varied, while giving me lots of momentum and motivation. Not only that, but it may actually be the ideal way to play games as far as I'm concerned, since I'm a serial game replayer that usually enjoys latter runs much more than first runs. And don't get me started on all those times I picked up a game, only to start a second run after a couple of hours and enjoy it ten times more than the initial run. Heck, I really should have implemented the OWOG system years ago, now shouldn't I?Well, better late than never, as they say. December will be all about VNs, as I have a serious VN itch to scratch and a ton of titles reading for the reading; and after that, we'll roll with the OWOG system. I'll see you soon with my next run report, dear fellow gamers; in the meantime, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Piofiore: Me against the Mafia - The Routes ", "date": "25/11/2020", "text": "Before I dive into the Routes, I have to rant against the prologue. What were you thinking, Otomate? Why did you make the prologue so darn hard to navigate? In most otomes, landing on your route of choice is merely a matter of hitting the right flag, or simply choosing your wooing material; but not so in Piofiore. Here, you have to hit a character flag and give very precise answers to a bunch of questions. After I tried and failed to get my routes of choice a half-dozen times, I finally gave up and ran to an FAQ — pretty ironic, knowing that I navigated the rest of the game without resorting to an FAQ. With that rant out of the way, let's move on to the Routes, which I'll lay down in the order I played them. Just for the record, I renamed the MC Monacia Orezza — a name I didn't create, and which I totally encourage you to google just for curiosity's sake. With that said, on with the show! (Giant SPOILERS ahead!) Nicola Francesca — Smooth OperatorNicola's Route is by far the easier to snatch, which is why I landed it first. It was bound to leave a deep imprint by sheer virtue of being my first steps into Piofiore; but even after playing the whole game, it remains my second favourite route. The feeling of danger is strong with this one, and my breath hitched more than once as I was faced with tricky choices over and over. Nicola may look kind and charming, but he's probably the most treacherous of the bunch: he's a liar through and through, and he'll lull you to complacency and bad endings if you don't pay attention. It should make sense that his Attribute is Honesty: only through sheer, blunt frankness can you melt his armour of lies and deception. With such a clear-cut Attribute, the best answers were easy enough to figure out — like, when you're busy baking dolce for Dante and Nicola pops up asking whom you're baking for, should you answer 'Dante' or 'Nicola'? With Honesty firmly in tow and a crap ton of vigilance, I landed the Best Ending on my first try, which made me feel like a million. Mafia survived, yay! I enjoyed the fact that the main source of danger and obstructing factor to the relationship was good guy Roberto de Feo — all the more so as his slow descend into madness was riveting to watch. Last but not least, Nicola is one of the most deliciously fleshed-out characters in the whole game; his deep and intense relationship with Dante is the stuff yaoi fanfics are made of, and it gave him very believable motivations. In fact, Nicola is probably the most 'human' and relatable beau: his goals are nicely sentimental, and it was sweet to help him reach them while keeping myself alive and winning his affections. And talking about winning his affections: after a whole lot of denial, the guy is ultimately forced to face his own feelings for the MC, which leads to a very steamy kiss. I cannot express how much I friggin' dig that trope, as cliché as it is; repressed love and lust really makes for the hottest, most intense make-out scenes ever.   Dante Falzone — Hot as IceThe game's poster boy boasts the dubious honour of being my least favourite route. This already happened in Collar x Malice and Sweet Fuse, so we definitely have a pattern here; and it makes perfect sense, given that Dante is very similar to Yanagi and Shidou. He's an ice queen-meets-tsundere, a man of great principles and coldness whose facade breaches ever-so-slightly once in a while yet never quite cracks. Warm feelings that never show are akin to no warm feelings at all; and it should surprise no one that Dante's Route is the chilliest, dreariest and most uneventful of them all. Heck, you hardly ever meet the guy during the first half of the route! To make matters worse, Dante's Attribute is by far the murkiest and hardest to pinpoint in the whole game. It's supposed to be Respect, but it's really just a mix of deference, gratitude, propriety and aloofness that varies depending on the circumstances. A typical example would be this: you're taking a stroll with bodyguard Leo Cavagnis and encounter Gilbert Redford, who asks why the heck you're cruising with the Falzone posse. The choice is between \"Things have been happening\" and \"Leo's my friend\"; and the best, Respect-raising answer is the latter. Not mightily obvious, methinks. Mind you, this didn't prevent me from snatching the Best Ending upon my first try — Mafia survived again, yay! As for the main obstruction, it was none other than Nicola, still as cousin-obsessed as ever — except that this time, I was clearly on the wrong side of his attentions. He was not happy at all to see me hover around Dante, oh no precious; I had to fend off his barely veiled animosity and keep it in check — and I totally lapped up that tricky balancing act. Dare I say that I enjoyed it more than the Dante-related business? That would be a bit exaggerated — but not by much, really. Dante's long-suffering, reluctant-Mafia-boss leitmotiv didn't touch me quite as much as Nicola's devotion-filled, anything-for-my-cousin one.   Yang — Sir Psycho SexyWell, colour me surprised: once in his natural environment, Yang is not nearly as insane and unsufferable as his behaviour in other routes may indicate. He's actually pretty lively and witty, and his route packs a good amount of welcome jest; not only that, but the whole Lao Shu posse is much kinder than expected, leading to some pretty light-hearted scenes. We're still dealing with the Mafia though, and with a seriously nutty boss to boot; so one must stay on their toes at all times, no matter how kind Yang may (wrongly) seem. Wisdom is by far the easiest Attribute to figure out, as the answers are really clear-cut: in most cases, you'll have to choose between a shrewd and sharp answer and a dumb and breezy one. That should make Yang's route a complete walk in the park; alas, it's anything but, due to a specific feature I'd dub 'delayed paybacks'. In VN, branching bad ends independent from affection levels usually unfold pretty fast after picking the wrong choice; but not so in Yang's route. Here, the branching bad ends are slapped in your face two or three chapters after picking the wrong choice. Worse, the main endings themselves operate on that system; this is absolutely infuriating, as it means that you can get them even with a perfect Status screen. Of course, I had to fall prey to that vicious trap: I first got stranded in both the Bad Ending and the Good one — just because I foolishly trusted Yang at the wrong time, or because I failed to realize that now was the time to give him my body after fighting to stay chaste the whole route. Sure, the Bad Ending was not nearly as gruesome as I had feared, and the game was kind enough to give me convenient hints about my failures; and so I finally managed to snatch the Best Ending from the jaws of repeated defeat. Still, this kinda soured my feelings towards what could have been one of my favourite routes, making it merely my second least favourite instead. And the ecchi factor was so nicely strong with this one, too! Jeez, what a pity. Orlok — Diamond in the RoughAll hail my favourite Route! Orlok pierced my heart, and instantly became one of my favourite otome characters ever. It's not just the fact that he's intensely kind, sweet and loveable despite being a more skilled assassin than all the Mafia bosses put together; it's the fact that you spend his whole route teaching him what it means to be human, to feel and to love. The combination of sheer ruthlessness when it comes to fighting and total cluelessness about everything else is a very potent one, bound to make Orlok a memorable character no matter what. I'm still trying to wrap my head around him to his day. Like, how can his route be so darn lovely and touching despite the fact that he slaughters the whole Burlone Mafia — bosses et all — by the end of it? And how can he feel so sensitive and vibrantly alive despite his cold demeanour and hardly expressive face? Well, the latter may be because he's not an ice queen, but rather a genuinely repressed boy learning to feel. Orlok's Attribute is Tolerance; but really, it's just plain old kindness. Be as nice as possible to the guy while being just and fair, like the holy figure you are in his eyes, and everything should work just fine. It did for me, and I sailed straight into the Best Ending with a piena fiore to boot. Orlok's route was a real breath of fresh air that could have belonged to a totally different otome; and boy, did it feel good to allow myself to be just gentle and affectionate with the beau du jour for a change. My only regret with that Route is the fact that Orlok and the MC don't get down and dirty at any point. Of course, that's fully understandable given Orlok's life story; and it'll probably make for real juicy fandisc content, when the boy will finally wake up to his long-dormant sexual urges.   Gilbert Redford — Golden BoyThis is by far the most mellow and relaxed route, the one in which the 'Survive the Mafia' factor is at its lowest. See, Gilbert is such a wholesome and charismatic character that everybody loves him and bows down to him — including his fellow Mafia bosses. This route sees everybody collaborate to save Gilbert himself, and by extension the whole town of Burlone, from a nasty framing scheme. Landing the Best Ending requires not only raising Affection and Trust, but also being at the right place at the right time to gather intel and evidence. While I managed to perform the latter just fine, I failed to pull off the former; despite my many experiments with answers, my flower plateaued at the second stage below piena fiore, which led me straight to the Good Ending. That ending was nice enough, with Gilbert and Monacia being both alive and an item; since I was starting to feel a bit burnt out with the game at that point, I decided to take it easy and jump straight to chapter 6 with high Affinity and Trust in order to land the Best Ending. While Gilbert's Route was quite entertaining, it sorely lacked the jeopardy factor present in other routes, that whole 'fight-for-your-life' thrill; and Gilbert himself is one of the most one-dimensional and superficial characters of the cast. Still, it remains my third favourite route, if only because it was so light-hearted and gave me such leeway to act.  Finale / Henri Lambert — Filler TimeLet's cut to the chase: that extra route feels like it was shoehorned into the game. Not only does it branches out of Gilbert' route at the halfway mark, meaning that you can literally spend hours looking for it (disclaimer: I used an FAQ to reach the starting point), but it adds nothing of value to the story. The Finale Ending is pure fan-servicey pandering, delivering a harem ending of sorts that's both cliché and completely improbable in the grand scheme of things; as for the Henri Ending, it doesn't provide enough character development to be truly satisfying, despite Henri being a genuinely haunting character. (So haunting, in fact, that I prefer his Route to Yang's and Dante's despite the fact that it's truncated.) My guess is that the writers wanted to tone down the gruesome overall tone of Piofiore through the inclusion of that light-hearted Finale Ending; as for the Henri Ending, it seems to be there solely to provide a 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' kind of character. Pretty unnecessary, methinks; there are already enough fruitcakes in the main Routes — but hey, whatever floats your boat, Otomate. As for myself, I navigated those extra Routes just fine, despite the growing Piofiore fatigue I was feeling at that point. And I have to commend them Routes for giving me the most meaningful choice in the whole game; a choice that didn't lead to a bad end for once, and could instead kickstart two vastly different outcomes into existence. And it was delightfully straightforward, too: either I could forgive Henri and I ended up with him, or I couldn't and I didn't. Pretty simple, ain't it? Sure, there were obstructions and pitfalls after that; but I liked how plain logical that choice was for a change.  There you have it, dear fellow gamers: my deeply enjoyable and fulfilling experience with Piofiore's Routes. Navigating the Piofiore shoals was not nearly as difficult or gruesome as I had feared; in fact, the deeper I went into the game, the more the danger factor evaporated, both out of my playing experience and out of the game structure itself. I especially enjoyed the story's simplicity, as I prefer games with simple yet sound premises; letting the heroine opt out of her destiny was a nice touch, and saved us from the bore of a canon route. I enjoyed even more the fact that characters that were allies in one route turned into foes in another; relationships were thus based on character dynamics rather than on mere personalities, and it was a nice change from your usual otome where everybody fawns over the MC no matter what. Now I wonder if the planned Piofiore fandisc will ever make it to our shores; but I'd wager it will allow us to romance Roberto de Feo, Leo Cavagnis, Lee Hsi-shan and Oliver Haas — and probably get into Orlok's pants at long last too. And now that I successfully survived the Mafia, it's time to sail towards new gaming shores. I'll see you soon with my gaming instinct's next catch, dear fellow gamers; in the meantime, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Piofiore: Mama I'm in love with a criminal", "date": "20/11/2020", "text": "I don't know what's most shocking here: the fact that I managed to quote Britney Spears two posts in a row, or the outrageous, indecent delight I derived from playing Piofiore. No otome since Amnesia:Memories has challenged me so hard, making me feel deliciously on edge. I had to work to get those good endings, and I relished every minute of it. It certainly doesn't hurt that all that challenge is backed up by stellar production values: I swear I could play that game solely to gaze at its gorgeous vistas and listen to its lush soundtrack. And my, the food descriptions! Gosh, I was salivating just reading them. Last but not least, there is that unique Piofiore atmosphere, which cannot be described in words yet sweetly grips my heart every time I think of the game.  All praise aside, I can now proudly claim full mastery of the Status screen's inner workings. It obviously indicates the state of affairs between the MC and the beau du jour; and alas, it's not nearly as clear as Amnesia:Memories' convenient metric gauge. After playing all five Routes, here are my conclusions: the raising of Affinity is indicated by the colouring of the flowers on the left, while the lowering of the Attribute is indicated by the grey stains appearing from the top right. The Attribute actually represents a quality that the player themselves should display as the MC — of course, it kinda makes sense that your resident perfect otome heroine should be Honest, Respectful, Wise, Tolerant, Trustful and Cooperative, on top of being a virgin with a mysterious birth mark on her chest. The Attribute gauge is somewhat filled upon starting a Route, and can deplete if the player fails to manifest the Attribute in their choices. Here are the four possible combinations of Affinity and Attribute: High Affinity / High AttributeLow Affinity / Low AttributeLow Affinity / High AttributeHigh Affinity / Low AttributeLanding the Best Ending requires colouring the flowers and keeping the Status screen clear of stains. Fortunately, Piofiore is not completely ruthless: you neither have to fill up the flowers entirely nor to keep the screen totally clean to land the Best Ending. From my experience, I can safely claim that the game will tolerate plateauing at the stage right below full flower (i.e. Piena Fiore), as well as one stain in the right-up corner, and still good-naturally deliver the Best Ending.  And since I'm mentioning the stains, it's crucial to keep the Attribute gauge as maxed out as possible, because some mandatory choices do lower it no matter what. It then becomes a matter of choice between bad and worse, with one option lowering the gauge by one notch and the other by two notches. I had to endure a bit of staining after such choices in most of my runs; and although I managed to wipe the Status screen clean later on, I swear it was darn uncomfortable while it lasted. And since I'm mentioning runs, I'll see you soon with my very own run reports — and they'll be juicy indeed. Until then, dear fellow gamers, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Ruby: The Exploud Solo Run", "date": "16/11/2020", "text": "Well well, what do we have here? I know, I know: the Pokemon 2020 Summer Season has overstayed its welcome already, stretching long into the autumn; however, I felt like I needed just one last shot of Gen III before I bade the series adieu for the time being. It was thus gloriously fitting that my Whismur should be named Encore — in homage to the sound theme running through its line and to the fact that he is the star of my last run of the season. Although I knew fairly well of Whismur and Loudred, I don't think I had ever encountered a wild Exploud before that run; and if I stumbled upon a Trainer with one, it totally failed to register. I was quite thrilled to cruise with a another three-stage Normal 'Mon that wasn't pink and cute, and I fully expected a stellar performance from my Encore — a performance that would crown the Pokemon 2020 Summer Season in the most dazzling and fulfilling way. The Exploud line didn't disappoint indeed. All three forms are perfectly balanced mixed attackers with the learnset to match, and they offered me a smooth and most satisfying cruising experience. I decided to tweak their evolution rhythm by alloting each form 33 levels to shine; and by a slick coincidence, each form ended up wielding its own unique Move pool. Whismur had Stomp, Uproar, Pound and Astonish; Loudred had Secret Power, Uproar, Astonish and Shock Wave; last but not least, Exploud had Return, Ice Beam, Shadow Ball and Earthquake. I sure didn't expect a Normal 'Mon to be granted not just one, but two Ghost Moves; Astonish certainly came in handy in the Rustboro Gym, saving me from many tedious turns of gnawing at Rock Mons' HP bar with non-effective Normal Moves. Once I was done with Dewford's Fighting Gym with a bit of welcome help from the Silk Scarf, the rest of the Pokemon League swiftly submitted to my Encore's badassness, granting me the glorious season ending I so craved.  And so, the Pokemon Summer 2020 Season officially comes to a close — and boy, was it an awesome season indeed. It was all about Gen III and VI, with other Gens not even standing a chance. That being said, I'm currently feeling the faintest itch to play Gens VII and VIII; and with the recent release of the second part of the Sword&Shield Expansion Pass, a Pokemon Christmas 2020 Season may well become a thing indeed. But for now, dear fellow gamers, let's sail together towards new gaming shores!"},
{"title": "Piofiore - Fated Memories: Me against the Mafia", "date": "12/11/2020", "text": "I've been warned against that game, by both my fellow gamer Kumiko and the official reviews on Metacritic; however, my gaming instinct was dead set on playing it, and you know how my gaming instinct operates — once it decides something, there's no swaying it. Not only do I really feel like playing VNs now, but the Italian setting is very much to my liking. See, I revealed my French roots already on that blog; and it's now time to unveil the fact that my great-grandfather hailed straight from Italia, which obviously makes me partial to all things Italian. I must add that I have yet to set foot in the country to this day — which is exactly why Piofiore's over-the-top, highly romanticized version of Italia is right up my alley.But beyond those fickle yet perfectly valid arguments, my gaming instinct was drawn to Piofiore for another major reason. One review on Metacritic compared it to Amnesia: Memories; and once I read that, there was no turning back. If you remember well, Amnesia: Memories was my first foray into the world of otome; and it remains one of my most memorable otome experiences, even to this day. It wasn't just an otome game: somehow, it was also a survival game, in which I had to navigate my way through dangerous shoals and make it alive to the Best Ending shores. Gruesome endings were aplenty, douchey guys with murkey motivations abounded, treacherous dialogue choices were everywhere, untimely deaths were a dime a dozen — and I lapped it all up. If Piofiore offered something even remotely similar, then there was no way I would pass on it.  So here's my goal with that game: to survive my entanglements with the Mafia, and make a beeline for the Best Endings — because if I do succeed in surviving the Mafia, then I might as well do it with a beau in my bed. Lofty goals indeed, if the reviews insisting of the delicate balance of dialogue choices in Piofiore are to be believed; but I'm confident I can make it. I won't bother playing the Normal Endings, let alone the Tragic ones; not only have I witnessed enough of Otomate's blood-chilling outcomes for a lifetime already, but I have a crap ton of other VNs ready for the reading. Instead, all Endings but the Best will be treated as Game Overs, proof of my glaring unability to navigate the Piofiore shoals. In order to make surviving that game even possible at all, a bit of homework was in order. Perusing reviews taught me that all characters have two gauges, and that both need to be filled to get the Best Ending. One of those gauges represents Affinity, and the other represents a secondary attribute specific to each character. Since the latter are nowhere to be seen at the beginning of the game, it's safe to assume they're revealed after finishing one route. Now, do I want to play extra-fair and play a crash test route for each character, just for the sake of unveiling Attributes? Why, not at all! Although this may be the intended way to play Piofiore, it doesn't square with my goal at all. And pray tell, doesn't it smell a mite like fake longevity — mixed with a whiff of fake difficulty to boot? I'm having none of that, I'm telling you; and so I'm starting the game with clear knowledge of all Attributes, courtesy of the all-knowing internet.  From now on, my path is clear. Just like I did in Amnesia: Memories, I'll monitor every single choice, comparing the Status screen after both options and choosing my path accordingly. In case a choice doesn't land me an Affinity increase, I'll go with the answer that best fits the character's Attribute. This means that I'll have to rely on my own judgement on a regular basis, which is a thrilling prospect. Now, will I be enough of a shrewd operator to make it unscated through the game? Wish me luck, dear fellow gamers; I'll see you soon with a run report!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sapphire: The Shedinja Battle Report", "date": "08/11/2020", "text": "Of course, a 'Mon as special and unique as Shedinja deserves its own dedicated battle report. The least I can say is that the whole run was full of surprises on the battle front: I blazed through Gyms I envisioned as massive hurdles, and was stopped dead in my tracks by roadblocks I didn't see coming at all. Without further ado, dear fellow gamers, I present you with my Unakite's battle prowess!We're actually starting from Dewford's Gym, because I took down Roxanne while my Unakite was still a cute little Nincada. The junior Trainers' 'Mons all went down swiftly in one neat hit, and Brawly wasn't much more of a challenge. I didn't manage to one-shoot his Makuhita, which in turn destroyed me with Knock Off; however, a lucky Fury Swipes did the trick, and I could sail to Slateport unhindered. I fully expected Slateport to be a mere formality; however, it was anything but. Instead, I was faced with my first major obstacle: an unassuming Team Aqua grunt in the Oceanic Museum. More precisely, an unassuming Team Aqua grunt with a Carvanha. You know where this is headed, don't you? Carvanha has Rough Skin, meaning instant fainting after one-shooting for my poor Unakite if the Move made contact. And oh, horror: all my four Moves did make contact. In a nutshell: I was in deep, deep trouble.The thing is, this major obstacle could have not existed at all, had I chosen to cruise in Ruby rather than Sapphire. Team Magma grunts have Numels instead of Carvanhas, which would have spared me the Rough Skin headache entirely. I'd like to claim that I picked up Sapphire for my Shedinja run on purpose, because it offered the highest challenge value; however, the truth is that I didn't factor the villain team's 'Mons at all. I had just cruised in Ruby a couple of times already, and I wanted a change. Pretty hilarious!  Anyway, I needed a non-contact Move to get out of this mess. It so happens that Shedinja can learn such a Move: that Move is Shadow Ball, and it would offer me some welcome STAB on top of saving me from contact fainting. Cherry on the cake, because Shadow Ball is a Physical attack in Gen III, it would take advantage of my Unakite's sky-high Attack. There was just one teeny-tiny problem: Shedinja learns Shadow Ball at Lv. 38, and I was Lv. 23. Making a Erratic-leveling 'Mon gain 15 levels solely through random battles would have been pure torture; so instead, I resorted to the Zigzagoon Rare Candy Pickup hack. I backtracked to Granite Cave and fought wild 'Mons until I managed to reap enough Rare Candies to raise Unakite to Lv. 38. My five Zigzagoons also snatched a bunch of most welcome Proteins in the process; and with Shadow Ball in my arsenal and an Attack higher than ever before, my Unakite finally managed to make mincefish out of that darn Carvanha. Goodbye Slateport, hello freedom!  The Mauville and Lavaridge Gyms were a complete cakewalk, with every single 'Mon going down with a clean Shadow Ball. I though I would struggle against Flannery's Torkoal, but it didn't resist Shadow Ball more than anything else before it. I was on a roll, and I fully expected the Petalburg Gym to submit just as willingly; however, I was in for a sore wake-up slap. Things went just fine until Norman; and then, I failed to one-shoot his first Slaking with Return, and it destroyed me with Faint Attack. Yes, his whole team wields bloody Faint Attack! I was in deep water again, and my run grinded to a complete halt. Once again, I would have to grind my way to victory. I backtracked all the way to Fallarbor to get the highest-level 'Mons available, and proceeded to reap Rare Candies. For the record, I was so unlucky with my pickups that I actually managed to gain two levels solely through battling! I tried Norman again at Lv. 62, but failed to take down his first Slaking by one pixel. A quick visit in Dewford to pick up the Silk Scarf later, I was back at it — and still failed to take down his first Slaking by one pixel. How on earth was that even possible? Slaking doesn't have Sturdy, and Focus Sash wasn't a thing until Gen IV; the only explanation was that Norman's first Slaking boasted ridiculously high Defense. Not wanting to grind again, I resorted to a more luck-based strategy: to open with Confuse Ray, let Slaking hurt itself in confusion, and then finish it off with Return. It took a couple of tries, but it finally worked; after that, both Vigoroth and the second Slaking went down with a single Return. Daddy destroyed, freedom again! After that, it was smooth sailing until Fortree's Gym. Mind you, nearly all the 'Mons there fainted with a single Shadow Ball or Return; however, my progression was halted by Winona's final 'Mon Skarmory. Not only did it refuse to go down in one hit, but even hurting itself in confusion plus Return or Shadow Ball didn't do the trick; and it wasn't long before I was destroyed by a nasty Aerial Ace. With confusion-induced self-damage being so random and Winona wielding Full Restores, it would have taken a million tries and an insane amount of luck to make it; and so, back to da grind it was! A couple of Rare Candies later, I went back in at Lv. 73 to test the waters. As I unleashed a Return on Skarmory to see how much damage it would dealt, I got a critical hit — and down crashed Skarmory. This was not the most honorable victory of them all, but I gladly took it nonetheless.Next in line was the Mossdeep Gym, which I actually feared. The issue there was the final double battle against Tate and Liza; if both of their 'Mons had super-effective Moves and if their second 'Mon took my Unakite down while I got rid of their first, I would be in deep trouble again. However, there was no need to worry, as only Solrock knows a super-effective Move; all I needed was to hit Solrock first, and the battle was pretty much over in two swift turns. Next came Wallace — or rather powerless Wallace, as none of his 'Mons wielded a Move that could hurt my Shedinja. And with that laughingly easy victory, the appetizers were over; now came the pièce de résistance, the final showdown that would make or break Shedinja as viable solo run material.  Once again, I was in for mighty surprises. I engaged Sidney with the Silk Scarf and started well despite his Mighthyena's Intimidate; however, I failed to one-shoot his Sharpedo with Shadow Ball. I tried again with the Spell Tag, and it worked just fine. I'm so, so glad I took the time and effort to get that item! En passant, you know your 'Mon's Attack is stellar when it manages to one-shoot a foe with a non-effective Move, which is exactly what my Unakite did to Sidney's Sharpedo. Phoebe's Ghost 'Mons were destroyed by my Shadow Ball, after which I switched the Spell Tag for the Silk Scarf and one-shot Glacia's whole team with Return. Then came Drake, and the first roadblock in the person of his Salamence. Not only did that darn dragon lowered Unakite's Attack with Intimidate, but I failed to one-shoot it with Return, leaving it free to destroy me with Crunch. Shadow Ball and the Spell Tag didn't do the trick either, and I knew I had to resort to the Confuse Ray strategy again. A single self-hit would suffice, as Return with the Silk Scarf only left Salamence with a few pixels of health; after a few infructuous tries, stars finally aligned and I could finish Drake's Altaria with one clean, smooth Return.  I switched again to the Spell Tag before Steven, and was immediately stopped dead in my tracks by his opening Skarmory. Shadow Ball only emptied 50% of that bloody bird's HP bar, and boosted Return even less. Yet I alsolutely needed a one-hit KO against Skarmory; otherwise, I'd be the one to go down with Aerial Ace. The Confuse Ray stategy wasn't an option: not only would Skarmory need to hurt itself three or four times in a row, but Steven would undoubtedly heal it at some point. My only option was the cheapest and most shamelessly luck-based strategy of them all: the Lucky Critical, folks. (Special mention to my fellow Pokefan Sieg!) A few tries gave me that much-needed crit, after which Claydol, Cradily and Armaldo went down in one smooth Shadow Ball. Aggron survived Shadow Ball; unfortunately, the poor thing didn't have a single Move that could hit me, and it was reduced to desperately trying to survive on Full Restores while I pummeled it to death with Shadow Ball. Finally, a single Shadow Ball was enough to take down Metagross and land me the Champion title. A bug one-shooting a pseudo-legendary: let that sink in for a moment. Anyway: well done, you! I've now proved that Shedinja is viable solo run material indeed in its home turf, and it was mightily fun to boot. That's another pair of Gen III Bug 'Mons under my belt; and my, do I love these indeed. Now I just have to tackle Volbeat & Illumise, and I'll be done with the Gen III Bug pairs. Those runs will have to wait for next summer, though; the Pokemon 2020 Summer Season has lasted more than long enough already, and it's time to put an end to it. Thanks for following my Poke-adventures, dear fellow gamers; until next post, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sapphire: The Shedinja Solo Run", "date": "05/11/2020", "text": "Here it comes, dear fellow gamers: the most insane, challenging Bug 'Mon run of them all. Did I manage to do the deed? You'll have to wait for the official battle report for the answer — let's keep the suspense alive! For now, let's line up the many specifications of that most unique run. A Shedinja run automatically doubles with a non-damage run — do or die indeed. I would have to worry about Flying, Fire, Rock, Ghost and Dark Moves, but also about Poison, Hail and Sandstorm damage. I would improvise on the spot regarding the latter category; as for the former, I decided to raise my one-shooting chances by picking up the right Nature for my Nincada. The only important stats were Speed and Attack: with only 1 HP, literally nothing else would matter. I needed a boosted Attack and a untouched Speed, i.e. a Nincada with a Lonely or Naughty Nature. I finally got the former, and it didn't disappoint: once leveled up all the way to the big 100 and after gobbling a dozen Proteins reaped by my crew of Zigzagoons, my little Unakite boasted an healthy Attack of 264. Pretty good for a Bug 'Mon , shall I say, and probably one of the five best Attack stats ever boasted by my One and 'Monlies.  High Attack was all nice and well, but it wouldn't be enough: to make it, I would also need powerful Moves that would guarantee one-shooting. Since Hyper Beam and Solar Beam were out because of their two-turn activation, my only realistic options were Return and Shadow Ball; and lo and behold, I spent nearly all my run spamming that duo. The other two slots were occupied by Thief, which I kept for a plan I'll detail in the next paragraph, and Confuse Ray, which came in handy in a couple of situations I'll detail in the next post. As mighty as Return and Shadow Ball were, I had an inkling their raw power wouldn't be enough against some 'Mons — I'm looking your way, Steven's team. I needed even more oomph to be sure to make it alive — to make it, full stop — and that extra oomph would be provided by none other than Type-boosting items. The Silk Scarf was easy enough to snatch in Dewford; the Spell Tag, on the other hand, was a whole other can of worms. It was only available at Mount Pyre, where Shuppets had a 5% chance of holding one. I went there and started spamming Thief at all the Shuppets I encountered; and wouldn't you know, I still didn't have a Spell Tag after 60 Thief in a row. I decided to change tactics and throw Ultra Balls instead; and this time around, it only took a dozen Shuppets to land me a Spell Tag. Was my Thief bugged, or was I simply supremely unlucky? Guess I'll never know, but I got my Spell Tag all the same. It came in handy indeed, as you'll see very soon.Indeed, I'm done with the preliminaries; I'll meet you again in the battle report, in which you'll finally learn if my Unakite made it all the way to the Champion and beyond. Until then, dear fellow gamers, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "World End Syndrome: Tips, tricks and a Route Walkthrough (spoiler-free!)", "date": "01/11/2020", "text": "Writing walkthroughs is not something I fancy doing; but I felt it was totally mandatory this time, to spare me the hassle of playing the game seven darn times again before tackling the Routes. And since I went through the trouble of writing and proof-testing that walkthrough, I might as well publish it for all my fellow gamers to use — all the more so as WES walkthroughs are indeed quite rare on the internet. I'll include the links to the individual Routes at the end of that post; but first, let's start with a bunch of tips, tricks and useful info about the game. Enjoy!Routes and endings: WES operates on a flag system, with no affection meter whatsoever — neither visible nor hidden. Clearing a route is entirely a matter of hitting the right milestones, and there is but a single ending per character. This makes seven endings total: the five character endings, the true ending (which is actually separate from the main story) and the so-called \"Worst End\", which will pop up every time you're not engaged on a character route. Once you polish off all five girls' Routes, you'll be automatically set on the Miu Route if you restart the game from the 'Chapter' point. If you want to revisit any of the other Routes, just replay said Route as usual — but AVOID going to school until the AM Club Meeting on the 05/08, even if your girl of choice lounges there. You won't miss any flag doing so; on the other hand, it will kick you out of Miu's Route, leaving you free to replay your Route of choice.The Aura Meter: Although it may look very much like an affection meter, it's not. As a matter of fact, you can fill it entirely while witnessing regular, non-flag scenes — which is exactly what I did during my first seven runs of the game. What the Aura meter does is give access to a couple of extra scenes that take place in the protagonists' dreams. On top of the five Aura colours featured in the Meter, you can also gain White Aura from NPCs and unlock two extra Dream scenes. The Aura Meter features five circles, each circle representing ten 'Aura Boosts' — i.e. scenes where Aura is granted. The first Dream scene is unlocked after 25 Aura Boosts (2,5 circles), while the second is unlocked after 40 Aura Boosts (4 circles). Last but not least, although the Aura Meter is here and active at all times, you actually need to go to the Cafe Interior in the Suburbs on the 9th at Night to get the Student Handbook and be able to check your Aura. The dialogue choices: Let's cut to the chase: the vast majority of dialogue choices don't matter in the grand scheme of things. Since there is no affection meter, the answer you pick ultimately boils down to the personality you want to don as an MC and the kind of reaction you want to elicit in your lady du jour. The few choices that do matter will either lead you straight to the Worst End or kick you out of a girl's route. Needless to say, I'll indicate of those crucial choices in my walkthrough. The Missions and Items: Let's cut to the chase again: none of the Missions or Items are mandatory to finish any Route. They're mere breathers, a little treat that's here to compel curious players and completionists to explore the game's every nook and cranny. You need to fulfill/find them only once, after which they'll be recorded in the game's save data for good, saving you the trouble of fulfilling/finding them in every route. I decided not to expand on them, since data about them is easy to find on the internet — I recommend that guide from my fellow gamer Yvonne's LadiesGamers blog.The Worldend Syndrome radio shows: Those are part of the non-mandatory yet interesting WES lore; and I'd highly recommend listening to them, as they can deepen understanding and appreciation of events. They can be listened to at Night in your Room in the Mansion, on the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 20th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd of august. The Worldend book: The same thing goes for Miss Yamashiro's novel: although reading it is not mandatory by any means, it provides interesting clues and insights into later events — not to mention White Aura Boosts. It takes ten reading sessions to go through the book, and those sessions can be tackled by going to My Room in the morning or afternoon. However, for some reason, not every visit there at such times will result in a reading. To save yourself some hassle, go to My Room on the 02/08 AM and PM, 03/08 PM, 05/08 PM, 06/08 PM, 07/08 AM and PM, 08/08 PM, 10/08 AM and PM, and you should be done with Worldend.   Save & Load Abuse: To crown that list of run-easing goodness, here come what is probably the single most useful feature in WES, and one that will make your play immensely sweeter and smoother. Here's how it goes: every witnessed event is recorded into the game's save data, even though you reload a previous save file or go back to the title screen right after. Practically, this means that you rack up Aura by replaying the same scene over and over, play a mission before going back to the route you're playing and witnessing the scenes you'd have missed otherwise, listen to the radio shows and read Worldend, or do whatever you fancy doing without altering your laser-sharp focus on the Routes. If this is not the ultimate tool against fake longevity, I don't know what is. As promised, here come the links to the walkthroughs; you'll also find them right below that post. I'll take my leave now, dear fellow gamers; until next time, keep playing and take care!The Maimi Route    The Saya RouteThe Hanako RouteThe Yukino Route The Miu Route Edit: Over time, many fellow gamers have provided extra details to my walkthrough, little quirks of the game I didn't spot despite my extensive runs. I added everything to my posts, without omitting to give credit in the comments. The bottom line is this: WES is a game full of nooks and crannies and mysteries, and we may not have discovered everything yet; but my walkthrough functions regardless of these details, and should bring you safely to the end ^^"},

{"title": "World End Syndrome: Flawed yet lovely", "date": "27/10/2020", "text": "Let's face it: World End Syndrome, one of PQube's many VN offerings, is seriously flawed. The unsuspecting player sees it right of the bat, when they're forced to clear the prologue twice in a row to be granted access to the main story. The flawed nature of the game is then cemented when the ever-so-slightly-suspicious player realizes that most of the dialogue choices don't matter whatsoever. Finally, it's confirmed when the now-blasé player stumbles upon wooden and unnatural scenes referring to events they didn't witness or ignoring fomer romantic developments entirely, just because the game operates on a 'one-time-and-place = one-fixed-scene' system. And yet, World End Syndrome is also incredibly lovely. The unsuspecting player's retinas are in for a treat right away, upon discovering the gorgeous vistas and adorable character designs. The loveliness of the game is then further enhanced by the unique and mesmerizing atmosphere of the game world, in which the main locale is treated as a full-blown character. Finally, the now enraptured player is bound to be swept off their feet by the simple yet deeply engaging and moving story, and the blessed realization that the characters are so much more than the anime tropes they seem to be at first glance. I love WES to pieces; and yet, that love story might not have existed at all. I'll admit it: upon starting the main story and discovering that I had to select places to visit without the slighest shred of indication regarding who or what I may find there, my heart faltered and I was a hair's breadth away from stuffing the cartridge back into my dedicated Switch Unikeep binder (story for another post, that.) Yet I was so enraptured by the art and the game's vibe that I decided to forge ahead and perform a crash test run of sorts, picking up places at random and seeing where this led me. Straight to the Worst Ending, that's where it led me! However, upon starting a new run and discovering that already visited places were marked as such, along with indications regarding who lounged there, I realized that it was perfectly in my power to uncover every Route without resorting to FAQs. The way was time-consuming yet foolproof: since there were seven different places to explore, I just had to play seven runs in a row, visiting every single spot at every possible time. Then, I'd simply have to track each girl like a crazy stalker closely to end up on her route. That's exactly what I did, dear fellow gamers; and not only did it work just fine, but it also greatly enhanced my experience of WES. Apart from the fact that uncovering all of a game's secrets by yourself is mightily satisfying, watching the same vistas over and over engraved Mihate Town in my mind, making it feel breathing and alive. I also got to understand and feel the depth of the Protagonist's depression through the many scenes that simply showed him wandering around aimlessly; as a matter of fact, some of my runs showed him slowly sinking into apathy as such scenes and days went by, in a striking and vivid way that stayed with me long after I finished those runs.  I fancy thinking that I played the game the canon way by exploring all possibilities. The story ultimately revolves around dealing with pain and sorrow and moving on towards recovery; getting to witness the outcomes of all types of behaviours, from the most involved to the most lethargic, really drives the point home. I'm glad I forged on and poured so many hours into WES, because it ultimately turned to be one of my best and most engrossing VNs experiences ever. And since I'm mentioning VNs, there should be more of these in the posts to come; but not before I expand a bit more on WES. Until then, dear fellow gamers, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Ruby: The Ninjask Battle Report", "date": "23/10/2020", "text": "I'll admit it: I didn't think this would work out — like, at all. Sure, my Moonstone boasted a solid, healthy Lv. 100; however, his Move pool was nothing to brag about, and certainly nothing to make the Hoenn Elite Four shiver in fear. Leech Life was virtually useless at that point, and Aerial Ace was barely more useful; this left me with Return and Shadow Ball as my best — and only, really — Elite Four-conquering assets. Factor in the complete lack of Battle Items in my inventory, and you'll understand why I harboured serious doubts about the very viability of an immediate Elite Four showdown.As a matter of fact, my doubts were so immense that I seriously pondered backtracking in order to get Dig and Giga Drain. The former would be a giant ace in the hole against Steven's Metagross; as for the latter, it would allow me to heal while dealing damage. The (giant) problem was that I had no Fly slave; and as far as I know, Hoenn Victory Road doesn't host 'Mons that can learn Fly. Getting those two Moves thus required walking back the whole length of Victory Road, and then walking and Surfing some more to reach Fallarbor and Route 122 — with a stop at Lilycove to snatch some Battle Items. As you can imagine, I was not exactly eager to tackle such a massive trip; and that's why I decided to try as I was and hope for the best. To my utter surprise,  my Moonstone managed to one-shoot every single Elite Four 'Mon bar Walrein and Salamence. This was an amazing start, and a perfect beeline for Steven; said Steven, on the other hand, proved to be a tad harder. Heck, more like a whole lot harder — yet not so hard that it became unsurmountable, which made for an highly interesting final battle. Steven opens with Skarmory, i.e. the most infuriatingly sturdy 'Mon this side of Miltank — and a Flying 'Mon to boot, meaning super-effectiveness against my Moonstone. It took a whopping eight Shadow Ball to clear the way, because of Steven (obviously) using a Full Restore. Claydol went down quickly with one neat Shadow Ball, after which I healed to be ready against Cradily. My strategy involved letting Cradily use its five super-effective Ancient Power while I healed every turn, after which I could safely pummel it into oblivion. That worked out just fine, and Cradily went down with just two Aerial Ace — meaning that I could have dispensed with emptying Ancient Power's PP; however, I didn't know how much damage Aerial Ace would deal, and I didn't want to risk fainting and having to restart the whole fight.Armaldo could have posed a threat, wielding Ancient Power as well. I could have used the same strategy as with Cradily; however, I decided to try my luck instead. My reasoning was as follows: if Rock-Grass Cradily went down with two Aerial Ace, then surely Rock-Bug Armaldo would do the same, Grass and Bug being both weak against Flying. This reasoning was laughingly incomplete, conveniently ignoring Armaldo's and Moonstone's stats; and indeed, Moonstone came very close to fainting, but still managed to submit Armaldo. Aggron and was a major pain in the arse, but not so much because of its stats or Moves: it used mostly the deliciously inefficient Earthquake, and it didn't resist Shadow Ball. No, it was a pain because Steven used three Full Restores on it, effectively undoing my hard and patient sapping work in the blink of an eye. I had to use a Max Elixir at that point, because I was running out of PP for Return and Shadow Ball. Then came the dreaded Metagross; I expected a tedious and arduous ultimate battle, and was left flabbergasted when that most formidable foe went down with two swift, clean Shadow Ball. Well done, you! Bug 'Mons usually make for wildly interesting Pokemon League battles, and Ninjask was no exception. That Elite Four showdown hit just the sweet spot between smooth and challenging, offering me a mighty fine mix of indecent one-shooting and fine-tuned strategies. My King's Rock didn't trigger a single time, which gives me added bragging rights: victory was attained solely with my Moonstone's natural abilities — and not the most stellar Move pool to boot. And now that I'm done with a challenging run for a change, how about another run that's even more challenging? Like, a run in which you literally do or die? Yup, that's right: a Shedinja Solo Run is next. Stay tuned for the upcoming run report, fellow gamers — heck, I'm psyched now!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Ruby: The Ninjask Solo Run", "date": "21/10/2020", "text": "A.k.a. even a lazy Pokemon solo runner relishes a good challenge once in a while. Mind you, the idea of a Ninjask solo run didn't exactly come out of thin air: it was first suggested to me by my fellow Pokefan Sieg, and I encountered a couple of such runs on Youtube. I always knew I'd cruise with Ninjask sooner or later; and this summer autumn, the time was finally ripe. Right of the bat, I was faced with a quandary regarding the evolution timing of my Nincada. Things were pretty simple: the first half of the game was going to be a serious challenge no matter what, but the nature of that challenge would vary depending on my little Moonstone's form. If I evolved him, I'd have to endure three super-effective Gyms in a row; if I didn't, I'd have to make do with a totally crappy Attack stat. I finally decided to evolve him normally and to rely on his sky-high Attack and Speed as a Ninjask to power my way through the Gyms. It worked in the end; but darn, was it tough. If not for a combination of Battle Items, grinding and Rare Candies, I'd never have made it through that first half.   Once I was done with Flannery's Gym, though, things suddenly became much cushier. Not only did I slowly but surely start to level up faster thanks to the Erratic rate, but I also gained access to much better Moves. Return, Shadow Ball and Aerial Ace came to replace Slash, Secret Power and Thief; Leech Life, on the other hand, remained firmly in place until the very end. Considering Moonstone had it already at Lv.7, that's 93 levels of Leech Life; pretty honourable longevity for such a weak Move, shall I say. And since I mentioned the very end, I can tell you the Elite Four showdown was supremely interesting — so interesting, in fact, that I'm going to write a dedicated post. I was genuinely surprised by the shallowness of Ninjask's learnset. It learns a grand total of five offensive Moves through leveling up and ten through TMs; on top of that, it learns no Bug Moves apart from Leech Life and Furry Cutter, and its only Flying option is Aerial Ace. No Silver Wind or Sky Attack for you, mate! Ninjask's learnset has fortunately been revamped since; but gosh, was it underwhelming in Gen III. Mind you, it didn't prevent me from becoming the Champion, as you'll see soon enough in my battle report. Until then, dear fellow gamers, keep gaming and take care!"},
{"title": "Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3: My work here is done", "date": "17/10/2020", "text": "10 hours and 15 levels after my last post, it's time for me and RB3 to part ways — even though the last boss still stands, and the credits have yet to roll. The game is entirely to blame for that desertion. Mind you, grinding is still as engrossing as ever; but even a serial grinder like me cannot help but get a tad irritated when a game lets beaten bosses escape just to make me fight them again later. I guess you were simply running out of funds, Compile Heart; but in that case, just make your game shorter, instead of throwing fake longevity left and right. When I had to vanquish Mr. Badd for the darn third time since the beginning of my run, I rolled my eyes, exited the game, erased my save file, turned my Vita off and put the cartridge back in my precious collection. I felt mightily better after that, knowing that I had put an end to my run before my feelings for RB3 soured beyond repair. Long story short: I enjoyed my run, even though I deem that last instalment the weakest and most dispensable of the Re;Birth trilogy. I'll see you soon with whatever game catches my gaming instinct's fancy next, dear fellow gamers; in the meantime, keep gaming and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Ruby: The Slaking Solo Run", "date": "12/10/2020", "text": "Here's another 'Mon I've been wanting to cruise with for years, without ever finding the right time to do so. But no more procrastinating: this summer autumn, Slaking is finally taking center stage — in its introducing game, no less. Given Slaking's unique Stat distribution and Ability, I expected a wildly interesting ride. I mean, we're talking about a 'Mon that boasts the same total base Stat as Groudon and Kyogre themselves — which, incidentally, is the 10th highest total base stat of all 'Mons including Legendaries — along with a crippling Ability that immobilizes it in battle half the time. This had to be a neat challenge, right?  It was a neat challenge allright, especially in the early stages. I'll say it: Slakoth is absolutely horrendous. Not only can it only use Moves every two turns, but it solely knows the weakest of the weak Scratch, and learns no other offensive Move until lv. bloody 19. Let it evolve at lv. 18, and it will learn Fury Swipes at lv. 19; stall its evolution, and it'll learn Faint Attack instead. Not knowing that, I let it evolve, and deprived myself of an useful Move for the Rock Gym; however, a couple of Battle Items did the trick instead. Upon discovering that Vigoroth was the exact opposite from the two forms sandwiching it — i.e. an hyperactive 'Mon that doesn't loaf around and literally never sleeps — I decided to delay its evolution not just by a few levels, but until the Elite Four itself. That was another brand of challenge, all the more so as I don't remember having ever run so long with a middle form.  One Everstone later, I was on a roll, ready to get more powerful and learn new exciting Moves. The latter were in no hurry to come, and I had to do with Shock Wave, Slash, Fury Swipes and Scratch until the darn 4th Gym. However, better Moves made a welcome entrance after that: first my beloved Return right before the 5th Gym, then the awesome Ice Beam right before the 6th Gym, then Aerial Ace right after the 6th Gym; combined with Shock Wave, those three made my Move pool until Victory Road. An Electric Move is a godsend in Hoenn, and it made all aquatic Routes a cakewalk; Aerial Ace neatly disposed of all Fighting 'Mons, and Return could take down everything thanks to the STAB. And talking about Victory Road, it was a bit different this time around. By the time I exited it, my Sapphire was only at lv.80 — the result of her Slow leveling-up rate, her non-traded status and the absence of a Lucky Egg. This was certainly good enough a level to submit the Elite Four; however, I was not satisfied. Not only have I somehow got used to tackling the League at lv. 100, but I also wanted to see how impossibly high Slaking's Attack would be at the big 100 — all the more so as my Sapphire boasted a Lonely Nature, making her Attack even impossibly higher. And thus started the Great Rare Candy Farming, folks. This is another neat trick I learnt from Jrose's run-changing Feebas Solo Run video: to make use of Zigzagoon's Pickup ability to reap all sorts of lovely items, including Rare Candies. And so, I recruited three Zigzagoons on top of the two I already owned, jumped on my Bike and started roaming the last segment of Victory Road. One hour later, I had reaped enough Rare Candies to hit the big 100, and finally let Sapphire take her final evolutionary step. I was rewarded by a whopping 411 Attack, which is totally the highest Attack I've ever encountered in a solo run — heck, it makes even powerhouse Zangoose look like a weakling! The Elite Four showdown that followed was, as you'd expect, absolutely unique. I tweaked my Move pool right before it, replacing Shock Wave and Aerial Ace with Brick Break and Earthquake; this means that I had super-effective Moves against all League Trainers, bar Phoebe. I can say it: I one-shot every single Elite Four 'Mon, including Steven's ones — oh, how sweet it was to take down his darn sturdy Metagross with a clean, devastating super-effective Earthquake. As for my Sapphire's survival during inactive turns, it was more than guaranteed by her rock-solid defensive stats. This created a fascinating Elite Four experience that was both intense and relaxed. You had that mandatory pause between active turns, followed by a deadly blow — creating a satisfying, pitch-perfect battle rhythm. And so, it turns out that the Slaking line is perfect solo run material. Not only that, but it also gave me something rare: a middle form I like better than its pre- and post-forms, both aesthetically and strategically. Hey, I think that's totally a first! Given how smoothly my run unfolded and how many Moves ran on me in the late stages, I don't think another Slaking run in a more recent entry is justified — but hey: better never say never, especially when it comes to Pokemon solo runs! And now, I'm sailing towards what will probably be the very last runs of that Summer 2020 Pokemon Solo Run Season — but certainly not the least interesting, oh no precious. Until these ultimate run reports, dear fellow gamers, keep gaming and take care!"},
{"title": "Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3: MOAR! ", "date": "09/10/2020", "text": "22 hours in, chapter 5 — chapter 6 closing in on — and a crap ton of pure, unadulterated fun. I'm on a total grinding roll, racking up trash mob fights and boss battles like it's going out of fashion. My whole crew passed the lv. 65 and 10000 HP mark, which should guarantee an easy victory in the boss fight to come — after which I'll probably have to grind five to ten more levels for the next boss in line, and so on until the credits roll. That's the Re;Birth life, baby! I'm enjoying the trip all the more as a mere ten hours of play ago, I was on the verge of quitting the game entirely. Despite my love for all things HN, I just couldn't get into the groove of that ultimate instalment. I was seriously put off by the constant stream of cutscenes, the long-arse goofy dialogues and the hardcore recycling of dungeons. The thing is, those are Re;Birth staples, and I enjoyed them until now; but we're now dealing with the third game in the series, and those beloved staples are starting to wear thin. Combine this with the absence of any zesty new character bar (the awesome but not nearly sufficient) Plutia and a story progression that's broken and disjointed like never before, and you get the mighty exception to the 'Third time's the charm' rule.  I'll say it: I love the Re;Birth series to pieces, but that third and last game shouldn't have existed in its actual form. It feels like the ultimate cheap milking, a complete troll of a game that's here to take the piss out of Re;Birth aficionados and see how much shameless recycling they can take before screaming blue murder and daylight robbery. Or does it? Well, that would be forgetting the essence of the Re;Birth, the series' major staple: that staple is Holy Grinding, and it shines as brightly in RB3 as in former entries. Once I latched onto that sweet, sweet grinding, I found myself totally addicted again.  Long story short: I'm acutely aware of RB3's flaws, but I'm enjoying it tremendously nonetheless. I certainly won't stop now, and this run will likely end in a whirlwind of mad, explosive grinding. Until then, dear fellow gamers, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Liepard Solo Run", "date": "05/10/2020", "text": "Dear fellow Pokefans, here comes my ultimate X&Y run of the Pokemon 2020 Summer Season! Mind you, that run was an inch away from not existing: my initial choice was to cruise with the Dark cat in its home region, thus getting sweet revenge at long last after my aborted Black Liepard run. However, I finally decided to roll with Gen VI for both aesthetic and strategic reasons. On the aesthetic side, I was really fond of Purrloin's revamped model, which gives him a faux cartoon spy air; on the strategic side, I really wanted to exploit Liepard's revamped learnset, which includes Play Rough — a Move I missed during my Delcatty OR run. My little Velours didn't have the easiest start in life: with pitiful defensive stats and solely the weakest of the weak Scratch at his disposal, the early stages were rocky. Not only that, but those early stages kinda overstayed their welcome: the next three offensive Moves Liepard can learn naturally, i.e. Fury Swipes, Pursuit and Fake Out, are nothing to brag to Professor Sycamore about. The only thing working in his favour was his amazing Limber Ability, which saved me from my single most hated status effect in Pokemon. Can more 'Mons be so deliciously immune to Paralyzis — pretty please? Fortunately, things took a turn for the better after I snatched Return in Lumiose, Thief in Camphrier, Rock Smash in Ambrette and Shadow Claw in the Glittering Cave; by the time I hit Cyllage and the Rock Gym, I was more than ready to take down Grant and his foils. My Move pool didn't change much after that. Aerial Ace made a welcome cameo right in time for Shalour's Fighting Gym, quickly followed by the awesome and much-awaited Play Rough; Night Slash came to replace Thief, while the highly serviceable Return and Shadow Claw stayed firmly in place all the way to the Elite Four and beyond. With half of my Moves under 80 Power and none of them super-effective against said Elite Four bar Drasna and Diantha, I expected a kinda struggly final showdown — and that's what I got allright. I fainted a couple of times against Siebold, Malva and Wikstrom, but finally managed to take them down with a subtle mix of strategizing, luck and Black Glasses. After that, Drasna and Diantha were the expected cakewalk: I even indulged in the luxury of submitting all of Diantha's 'Mons bar Amaura with a super-effective Move. I kept my eyes peeled for interesting details, and was rewarded by the uncovering of X&Y's subtle, blink-and-you-miss it rivalvry dynamics. I used to think that X&Y's pair of rivals were bland pushovers, the less antagonistic of all Pokemon rivals; however, they're actually anything but. Calem and Selena ooze a potent mix of jealousy, bitterness and desire for revenge, barely concealed under a thin frosting of cold politeness. It starts with them wondering how Professor Sycamore knows you despite your recent arrival, keeps going with them disparagingly calling you \"neighbor\" instead of using your nickname, and culminates with them bemoaning their reliance on you. It's basically the Blue story all over again: they should have been the leader of the pack, anointed by the resident Pokemon expert in person — until you popped up at the last minute and completely stole their thunder. Unlike Blue though, they finally submit to your awesomeness and end up respecting you in earnest. All in all, this is a really deep and subtle rivalvry — maybe a bit too much for its own good, because it's all too easy to miss it entirely. Meet my new kink: to pimp up my Trainer with the same colours as my 'Mon. At any rate, my annual revisitation of Kalos comes to an end with that run. There will probably be more Pokemon goodness before I'm fully done with the Pokemon 2020 Summer Season, though — and nevermind that it's actually autumn now! Until the next run report, dear fellow gamers — keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Collar X Malice Unlimited: Second time's the charm", "date": "01/10/2020", "text": "It happened with Steins;Gate 0 already, and it's happening again: for the second time, I find myself loving a VN's sequel ten times more than the original game. One more time, and we'll definitely have a pattern; but for now, let's focus on the awesomeness of CxMU. To put it simply, this sequel offers everything I wanted from the first game, and more. I mourned the absence of puzzles in CxM; lo and behold, they appear in Unlimited, and they're tough enough to please me. The crew's interactions are delightfully more subtle and complex, and there's more than enough character development to elevate CxMU way beyond the status of mere fandisk. There is a crap ton of gorgeous art to feast one's eyes upon — much more so than in the original, actually. Last but not least, that game feels a million times more wholesome than its predecessor. The rampant douchiness of the beaux has been virtually erased, to be replaced by much kinder and more mature attitudes towards Hoshino; there are also no bad endings to be found, only a so-called 'normal' ending — which is actually perfectly nice — and a 'best' ending that's even sweeter and fluffier. Cherry on the cake, the crew now sports more sensible hair styles and classier outfits, and Enomoto drops his dumb eyepatch at long last.   As for the 'more', that would be the unexpected yet much welcome humour, as well as the many scenes involving the crew sans Hoshino. If there were a reversed Bechdel test spotting the presence of two male characters talking about something else than the MC in an otome game, then CxMU would pass it with flying colours. There's also an interesting chunk of 'what if', parallel universe-ish narrative elaborating on the destiny of an Adonis version of Hoshino — and allowing us to get up close and personal with the Adonis crew while we're at it. To crown this festival of goodness, you get a couple of extra romantic routes. Older and happily married Morioka and Mochida remains out of Hoshino's romantic league and wandering hands; on the other hand, Minegishi, Saeki and Yoshinari are now hers for the wooing. I didn't even envision Yoshinari as a potential mate for Hoshino when I played the original; but now that I've played his route, I deem their romance the sweetest and most heartwarming of the bunch, more than worthy to become canon in yours truly's eyes.Long story short, I love that game. For all intents and purposes, it's actually more akin to a regular VN with large chunks of romance and steaminess than to an otome. I would blindly recommend CxMU to every VN aficionado, if not for the fact that having the original under your belt is absolutely mandatory to even understand what's happening and get a good feel of the characters. At any rate, I'm glad I gave that sequel a chance despite not liking the original; and now, I'm gonna dive right into another VN, as I'm very much in the mood for the genre right now. See you soon for more narrative goodness, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Alpha Sapphire: The Tyranitar Solo Run", "date": "27/09/2020", "text": "That run may well not have existed at all, as I discovered the Tyranitar line solely by chance. While I was cruising Route 18 without Repels for some reason in my last Y run, I stumbled upon a Pupitar. That 'Mon looked so bizarre that my curiosity was instantly piqued; upon researching that new creature, I discovered that its whole evolution line was perfect solo run material, and there was no turning back. A Tyranitar run was going to be a thing, and no later than immediately.The list of things that make Tyranitar a stellar One and 'Monly is vast indeed. First thing first, it's a three-stage evolution line that mimics bug growth, with a pupal-like middle stage and a nicely late final evolution at Lv. 55. It's also a pseudo-legendary that boasts the 16th highest total base stat of all 'Mons, with a whopping 600. It also changes Type upon its last evolution, going from Rock/Ground to Rock/Dark; that change is guaranteed to shake things up when it comes to STAB and weaknesses. Speaking of which, Tyranitar is afflicted by a mammoth seven weaknesses, including a double weakness to Fighting; that certainly balances its high stats quite neatly. Last but not least, it was granted a Mega Evolution in Gen VI, effectively making it a four evolution stage 'Mon; and you know I just cannot resist ME, even though they make the games laughingly easy. It should surprise no one that the ensuing run was smooth as heck and pure fighting delight from beginning to end. Larvitar is just so adorable that I wanted to feast my eyes upon it longer than Lv. 30; and thus I delayed my Malachite's evolution into Pupitar until Lv. 50. I expected to struggle mightily; but with Moves like Bite, Chip Away, Rock Tomb and Rock Slide at my disposal, its wasn't even that hard. This makes me question the viability of a full Larvitar solo run, which is something I'd love to tackle — because heck, Larvitar is just too cute. Anyway, once I crossed the final evolutionary rubicon, the late stages of my run became a total breeze. Because indeed, who wouldn't blaze through any living thing with a Tyranitar armed with Crunch, Chip Away, Earthquake and Rock Slide? Heck, I didn't even bother to snatch Return this time around! Hoenn being Hoenn, I half-feared the abundance of Water 'Mons in the game's late stages; but it turned out I needn't have worried, as everything fainted before they could even throw a drop of water at my Malachite. That run was actually too easy and smooth, even for my lazy taste; and so, I decided to shake and spice things up for the Elite Four. I did that by getting rid of all STAB and deliberately keeping my Moves under 75 power: and that's how I ended up with Fire Fang, Ice Fang, Thunder Fang and Brick Break as my final Move pool. Even with that nerfed set, the Elite Four remained a cakewalk, with all 'Mons bar five going down in one clean hit. I even had the luxury of using all my Moves AND going all super-effective against five of Steven's six 'Mons: Thunder Fang for Skarmory, Brick Break for Aggron, Ice Fang for Claydol and Cradily and Fire Fang for Metagross. Long story short, the Tyranitar line didn't disappoint; that run was pure pleasure from beginning to end, and I'm seriously itching to run with the creature again in its home region — with the unbearably cute added benefit of watching it trail behind me in HeartGold or SoulSilver. But that's a story for another time and post, dear fellow gamers; for now, let's move on to the next run in line!"},
{"title": "Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 - V Generation:  Here we go again", "date": "21/09/2020", "text": "The Re;Birth subseries is strongly linked to summer as far as I'm concerned. This is solely due to the fact that I played the first two entries precisely at that time of the year; since then, thinking of the series brings back memories of sparkling sun, green tea pots and summer TV shows playing in the background. Of course, it works the other way too, as all those things can trigger a strong craving for all things Re;Birth. This is precisely what happened this summer, and I was more than happy to cave in and dive into the yet unplayed third entry.I was amazed to see that despite not having touched a Re;Birth game for a whopping four years, I was back on track right away. Everything felt deliciously familiar and welcoming, and it wasn't long before I was grinding with abandon. Re;Birth's brand of grinding hits just the sweet spot between stimulating and soothing. It equally lends itself to focused playing and to mindless, front-of-tv playing, and I'm indulging in both depending on the mood.  I don't have much to add regarding gameplay mechanics, since I already laid them down in my older Re;Birth posts. (See here and there.) RB3 is basically more of the same, bound to delight Re;Birth aficionados and make others scream ripoff. One different thing, though, is the fact that party members come and go on a whim; I don't remember this happening in former entries, and I don't like it much, as it spoils my grinding's smoothness and regularity. Do you know how messy it looks to have party members at uneven levels, Compile Heart? Oh, well; as long as I get the opportunity to level up my chosen crew at some point, I guess I can manage that small annoyance.Smug collector face. On a more general note, I can proudly claim that I'm up to date regarding physical copies of HN games, with nearly every single game secured in my precious collection. The only entry missing is the elusive Megadimension Neptunia VII, which I ordered from Limited Run Games and which has yet to be produced; in the meantime, I'll play the digital version, which I got on a discount (before I knew about the LRG run, that goes without saying.) Anyway, I'll see you soon with my next RB3 run report, dear fellow gamers. In the meantime, keep gaming and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Aerodactyl Solo Run", "date": "17/09/2020", "text": "That run is the surprise of the summer: I was absolutely not planning to run with that oldest of Poke-fossils, neither now nor ever. However, as I was cruising in Glittering Cave, a fateful Rock Smash produced a piece of Old Amber. Having no idea what that item was, I ran to Bulbapedia and discovered the link with Aerodactyl; and when I saw that he boasted a Mega Evolution and that his Mega Stone could be obtained in the exact same spot where fossils were revitalized, there was not turning back. An Aerodactyl run was going to be a thing indeed, and no later than right now. A bit of Breeding, Trading and Hatching later, I was the proud Trainer of a newborn Aerodactyl; and my, was it a shock to discover my little Météores' starting Move pool. I mean, what kind of monster can wield Wing Attack and Bite at bloody lv. 1? Those are 60 power Moves, for Arceus' sake! Needless to say, one-shooting very quickly became routine. As my Météores boasted a Careful Nature and thus reduced Sp. Attack, I decided early on to make him a pure physical attacker — and his learnset was more than happy to indulge me. Wing Attack and Bite were ultimately replaced with Aerial Ace and Crunch, along with Return and Ancient Power. Being Special, the latter was far from ideal; however, I stuck to it for a good third of my run because of the STAB and the all-stat bonus effect. I ultimately settled for Earthquake, Dragon Claw, Iron Head and Rock Tomb as my final, Elite Four-obliterating Move pool. Needless to say, said Elite Four was a mere formality, with every 'Mon going down in one clean hit bar Gyarados, Scizor, Probopass and Gourgeist. Overall, I can say that Aerodactyl's battle prowess is absolutely stellar, and that he's dope solo run material despite his five Type weaknesses. He certainly fared much better against Fighting 'Mons than his fellow fossil Amaura, thanks to his secondary Flying Type that cancels his weakness to Fighting. The Cyllage Rock Gym was a bit hairy, being so early on in the game and without Mega Evolution to save the day; but Météores finally triumphed thanks to his high Attack, the Rocky Helmet and a bit of luck. By the time I challenged the Electric and Ice Gyms and the Water and Steel Champions, Météores had ME in tow and was more than overleveled enough to take care of them without breaking a sweat. The catch here is Aerodactyl's frustratingly slow growth: not only is he afflicted with Slow leveling-up rate — which ultimately forced me to backtrack and fight earlier Trainers so he could hit the big 100 before the Pokemon League — but he also takes his sweet time to learn Moves. I was absolutely flabbergasted to discover that he learns Giga Impact as late as lv. 83: while this is perfectly consistent with his fossil nature and Rock Type, I shudder when thinking of the players who want to use him in a regular run setting. I was also quite miffed to see his wonderful Rock Head Ability go to waste in my run, as he learns no recoil Moves through leveling-up and I didn't find any recoil TM. Oh, well; he did fine enough with what he had, and it's all that matters.That glorious experience totally makes me want to run with more fossil 'Mons. Since there is one or two of them in nearly each Gen, I'll probably indulge in a round of fossil runs sooner or later — and create a matching feature on that blog. But for now, other runs are begging for attention; see you soon with more Pokemon goodness, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Vivillon Battle Report", "date": "12/09/2020", "text": "Welcome, dear fellow Pokefans and Bug 'Mon lovers, to the story of my Vivillon's battle prowess. Bug 'Mons usually make for wildly interesting battles, and Vivillon was no exception. I'd say this though: as far as Bug 'Mons go, Vivillon confortably lounges in the top tier. It's crazy fast, boasts sky-high Sp. Attack and HP and can gain great Type coverage; as a matter of fact, Vivillon is so good that my Swaziland mostly blazed through Kalos, one-shooting everything in his wake. There were, however, two instances where he met his match and I was forced to strategize and grind my way to victory. It should surprise absolutely no one that the first of these roadblocks was Grant's Rock Gym in Cyllage. Not only is Vivillon afflicted with a double weakness to Rock, but this is but the second Gym in the game, meaning that the benefits of overleveling had yet to kick in. I went in at lv. 32 with Psybeam, Return, Fairy Wind and Struggle Bug in my arsenal, and managed to beat every single Trainer in the Gym thanks to clever tactics; however, Grant was another matter entirely. I completely and laughingly failed to take down his Amaura: that darn fossil always opened with Rock Throw, destroying my Swaziland in the process. I tried using an X Defense on the first turn, and barely survived one-shooting; unfortunately, I could do nothing after that but heal every turn. There was no getting around it: I needed to grind.  After taking down a number of wild 'Mons and Trainers I had avoided before, I was back with a vengeance at Lv. 35. Three levels weren't bound to make a whole world of difference; strategy was still very much needed, and I tried a bunch before nailing the right one. One-shooting failed, as well as two-shooting — well, at least I tried, didn't I? The Rocky Helmet + Super Potions combo — which I used to great affect with Amaura itself, how ironic — failed too, because Amaura's Rock Throw and Aurora Beam don't make contact. On top of that, Amaura now always opened with Thunder Wave and paralyzed me; so I had to take that into account as well. The winning strategy involved setting up 5 X Defenses and 2 X Sp. Attacks, while healing when necessary. I then used a Paralyze Heal and proceeded to attack with Psybeam, i.e. my most efficient Special Move under those rocky (indeed) circumstances — and down went Amaura in one hit! After that, Tyrunt was a breeze, meekly going down with a single Fairy Wind. Well done, you!Once again, it should surprise no one that the second hairy battle situation of that run was the Elite Four itself. It was actually more uneven than hard per se, going from one-hit KOs to several turns of struggling. By that time, I had raised my Swaziland's affections all the way to Best Friends Forever (i.e. all five hearts), and it helped tremendously: Swazi 'toughened up' through a one-hit KO and survived with one HP, and avoided a couple of other potentially deadly blows. Malva's 'Mons were one or two-hit affairs with Psychic and Hurricane, as well as Drasna's ones with with Bug Buzz and Psychic; as for Siebold, his whole team went down neatly with Energy Ball. Wikstrom was the hardest of all by a very long shot, as my whole Move pool was non-effective against his Steel 'Mons. I set up one X Defense and one X Sp. Attack I had in store, and got a nasty case of Torment as I was getting rid of Klefki; still, with patience and lots of Full Restores, I finally managed to wear his team down and could move on to Diantha. It was sweet, sweet revenge to one-shoot her Aurorus with Energy Ball; I didn't have Fairy Wind anymore, but Energy Ball took care of Tyrantrum. Cherry on the cake, Mega Gardevoir went down in two clean hits with Bug Buzz, crowning my Pokemon League epopee in the smoothest and most satisfying way.   That's it for Vivillon, dear fellow Pokefans; however, you'll be glad to learn that I'm not done with Bug 'Mons quite yet. I have not just one, but two other Bug runs lined up before the end of the Pokemon summer season — Gen III Bug runs, no less! I'll keep the suspense intact for now, and I'll see you Bug 'Mon lovers with glowing (hopefully) reports of those runs. And now, on the next One and 'Monly!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Vivillon Solo Run ", "date": "09/09/2020", "text": "Here comes the last of my three reader-inspired solo runs, starring Kalos' resident butterfly. Vivillon was suggested by my fellow Poke-fan and Bug 'Mon lover Kumiko, who expressed her curiosity about which pattern I would land. The thing is, I know for a fact that my country gets the Meadow Pattern — i.e. the default pattern, the one that appears on Viola's Vivillon and on Bulbapedia. There was thus no suspense whatsoever, and I needed a plan B. That plan involved going on Random.country and refreshing the page until I landed a country that was featured on the 2DS list. That fateful country turned out to be Swaziland — which also became my Vivillon's name — and it granted me the Sun Pattern. Pretty enough, and certainly better than a number of other patterns out there.The ensuing run proved wildly interesting in the strategic department — so interesting, in fact, that I'm going to write a detailed post about my Swaziland's battle prowess and hardships. For now, I'll focus on the usual nitty-gritty of solo run reports, starting with Nature. My Swaziland's Quiet Nature granted him higher Sp. Attack, which was a blessing given his learnset, and lower Speed, which was perfectly tolerable. With Infestation, Tackle, Struggle Bug and Stun Spore, his early Move pool was nothing to brag about; however, things quickly got better with the arrival of more powerful options. You can see above the pretty nifty Move pool I used for most of my run: Draining Kiss saved my hide more times than I care to count, Bug Buzz was crazy powerful, and Hurricane was the best thing this side of Earthquake. It would have been even deadlier, had Swaziland been endowed with Compound Eyes instead of Shield Dust and gained an Accuracy boost; but hey, it was awesome enough as it was. Also, I've refined the art of reaching lv. 100 right before the Pokemon League: Swaziland hit the big 100 upon beating the last 'Mon of the last Trainer on Victory Road. Perfection!Even after all these X&Y runs, I'm still spotting details I've never noticed before, such as the cultish nature of Team Flare. There is that one girl in Lysandre Café, who says she's nearly saved 5.000.000.000 pokedollars; later, you meet a grunt in Geosenge who claims she bought a new life for the same amount, which may or may not be that same girl from before. I'm also wondering about the relationship between Sycamore and Lysandre. Sycamore is quite the socialite, chatting urbanely with all of Kalos, from Diantha to Dexio and Sina; however, there seems to be something more to his relationship with Lysandre. In Couriway, Sycamore apologizes on Lysandre's behalf, claims he knew of Lysandre's extreme convictions, and deplores not having stopped him sooner — all things that indicate a measure of intimacy between the two, which makes me wonder if they are childhood friends, former colleagues or something. A quick search revealed the existence of a Sycamore x Lysandre ship, which means that I'm definitely not the only one who spotted a bond there.  All this makes me wanna discover Kalos more, both in terms of lore and topography. There are a number of spots I have yet to explore, especially in Lumiose and Waterfall-locked areas, and I'm gonna wait for my shiny new X&Y strategic guide to indulge in discovering them. At any rate, this was a delighful run, which I obviously dedicate to my fellow gamer Kumiko. I'll see you all soon with the dedicated Vivillon battle report, and a couple of extra solo run reports after that. The Pokemon Summer Season 2020 is still a thing, oh yes it is!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Pangoro Solo Run", "date": "05/09/2020", "text": "Here's my second 'Readers' suggestions' solo run of the summer, starring the cute-turned-badass panda of the Pokemon world. That candidate came from my fellow Pokefan Sieg; and lucky me, Pancham had been on my Solo Run Material List for quite some time. It was thus my pleasure to run with him, all the more so as he soon turned out to be stellar solo run material indeed. My little Tuxedo also boasts the honour of being my first-ever traded Egg — should have named him Louise Brown, now shouldn't I? Things went sailingly on all fronts: my Tuxedo was blessed with a Naive Nature, and I was more than grateful for the Speed boost, which counterbalanced the Pancham line's naturally low Speed. He only knew Tackle and Leer right out of the Egg; however, his (already) high Attack gave him a good start in life — and battle, letting him exploit Tackle's power to the fullest. And talking about Moves, I had a real blast on that front. While leveling-up, Tuxedo learnt Fighting and Normal Moves like it was going out of fashion. Arm Thrust, Karate Chop, Circle Throw, Vital Throw, Sky Uppercut, Hammer Arm, Slash, Comet Punch, Body Slam: he learnt 'em all and wielded 'em all, if only for a couple of battles. Aerial Ace and Shadow Claw also stayed a while (how a 136 kg panda can master Aerial Ace, I have no idea), before I finally settled for Sky Uppercut, Return, Crunch and Earthquake in the late stages of my run. Needless to say, the Elite Four was mostly a one-shooting fest with such a Move pool — it was especially thrilling to take down Diantha's mega-evolved Gardevoir in one smooth, neat Crunch. This segues nicely into my impressions of Pangoro's added-in-evolution Dark Type. My experience of secondary Dark Type so far is that is add little and removes a lot — and Pangoro keeps up with that trend. The added Dark Type gives him a Fighting weakness, of all weaknesses — how very ironic — and doubles his Fairy weakness. Not all is lost though, as he loses his Psychic weakness and gains complete immunity in the process. As you may imagine, the back-to-back Laverre Fairy Gym and Anistar Psychic Gym were night and day: while I avoided every Trainer bar Valerie in the former and doped Tuxedo with a couple of Battle Items to make it out alive, I blazed through the latter without taking a single HP of damage. Still, I'm not yet convinced by Dark as a secondary Typing, and I'm still pinning for the 'Mon that will make me change my mind. Long story short, that run was pure delight from beginning to end. Pancham/Pangoro seriously packs a punch: with an Attack of 296 at lv. 100, Tuxedo definitely lounges in my Top 5 Most Powerful Physical Attackers — and it has the learnset to match too, with a crap ton of Physical Moves at his clawtips. So, here's to you, Sieg: a successful and delighful Pangoro Solo Run for the summer! Bet you didn't expect anything less, did ya? I'll see with soon with the third and last (so far) run of the feature, dear fellow gamers; until then, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon: New Solo Rules", "date": "31/08/2020", "text": "Dear fellow gamers and Pokefans, I have to celebrate an amazing novelty that's going to change the face of my solo running career forever. As I was innocently watching a Youtube video about a Feebas Solo Run, I stumbled upon the most life-altering piece of Poke-data of them all: it is actually possible to trade Eggs. This means that you can raise the hatched 'Mon as your own, and thus do away with the Obedience cap entirely. I swear this never even crossed my mind; and I would have kept ignoring that blessed feature, possibly for years, if not for that video. So, a giant shout-out to Jrose for broadening my solo run horizons in the most dramatic and exponential way! I totally encourage you to check the man's channel if you don't know it already. He's kinda my polar opposite when it comes to running solo: while I'm all about slick cruising, one-shooting and over-leveling, he's all about mad challenges, under-leveling and pitch-perfect strategies — and it's quite fascinating to watch.Indeed, the number of potential solo runs exploded with that discovery: I can now cruise with literally every single 'Mon, in any entry from Gen III onwards. Heck, I could even go as far back as Gen II if I had functioning GSC cartridges! And I'm not even mentioning the fact that trading Eggs allows me to run with a Lv. 1 'Mon from the very beginning of the game, thus experiencing the absolute quintessence of solo running and creating the most outstanding bond with my lone ranger. It also conveniently removes the temptation to slap a powerful TM on my One and 'Monly before Trading it, thus altering the purity and regularity of its growth. Not only that, but getting rid of the Obedience matter means that I can now battle to my heart's content, without ever having to worry about hitting the current cap. It always felt a tad counter-intuitive to delay my lone ranger's growth and pace myself, skipping battles and counting levels to avoid a mutiny. This is not how I envision a fulfilling solo run; I want to run and rush around, fight as many Trainers as I want, and generally blaze through the whole region while one-shooting every living thing. Of course, there has to be a bit of a catch in such a amazingly perfect situation; and the catch is none other than the impossibility to pick up my One and 'Monly's Nature and Ability — lest I'm ready to go through the trouble of hatching several Eggs. On the other hand, Nature is not really relevant before Gen VI, and the choice of the Ability is only important in the case of an hindering Ability such as Normalize; so things are really not that dramatic after all. (And hey, getting a random Nature and Ability can even provide a modicum of challenge!) With that said, trading an Egg may not be exactly optimal for some 'Mons. Right now, the ones I can think of are the ones that evolve in a given place that may be far into the game, such as Glaceon or Leafeon. For those 'Mons, and those 'Mons only, a regular trade might prove the best option. But hey, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it! I'm hardly done wrapping my head about all my brand-new solo run options; for now, I'll just bask in the sheer joy of being able to cruise with 'Mons that were faraway dreams until now.  This also neatly solves the eternal quandary of 'Which entry should I tackle?'. The answer used to be \"the entry that hosts the coveted One and 'Monly early on\", then it became \"any entry that hosts the coveted One and 'Monly and has an Obedience cap-friendly Gym Distribution \"; now, it can be \"any entry that hosts the coveted One and 'Monly\" — full stop. Mind you, I'm certainly not planning to go as far as to cruise with a given 'Mon in every game it appears in; however, I can very well envision tackling a 'Mon's introducing entry, along with a much later entry if said 'Mon has been revamped in the meantime. As for 'Mons hailing from trade-devoid Gen I, I'll just cruise with them in FireRed and LeafGreen. Of course, I had to try that shiny new trading avenue right away; and that's how I found myself trading an Egg in my freshest Y run, along with a Magna Armor Slugma to speed up hatching — and a Lucky Egg for my future One and 'Monly, just because I can. Gotta give the new baby a welcome gift, right? The ensuing run is still in progress, but let me tell you: this is absolute dope. I'll keep you posted soon enough, dear fellow gamers!Before I take my leave, here's one last new rule for the Poke-posts to come — and the ones already written, which I'll amend in the process. Since Pokemon solo running has become a bit of a second career for me, I feel like it's time to be a mite more precise in my run reports titles; and thus, starting now, I'll use the name of the final form my lone ranger reaches in said titles. This way, you'll know immediately if we're dealing with a full evolution line run or a no-evo run. Well, that's all for now, dear fellow gamers; until next post, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Clefable Solo Run ", "date": "28/08/2020", "text": "This is the first of three solo runs suggested by you, dear fellow gamers! Clefairy was Melanie's suggestion; this is not a 'Mon I would have cruised with on my own volition, so I was really curious to see how it would fare on the battlefield. If my Jigglypuff solo run was any indication, then Clefairy would fare quite well indeed, being the same kind of cute creature boasting Fairy Type — because indeed, I wanted to handle the Kalos version of that 'Mon and get the opportunity to tackle another Fairy 'Mon run. So, how did my little Chamallow get on in Kalos? Quite well indeed, as we'll see right now.My lovely pink marshmallow started her life as a Cleffa on my Omega Ruby cartridge; and as I was about to trade it, I wondered if I should slap a TM on her. Sure, she had Pound already; but with her miserable base 25 Attack, there was no way she was going to take down 'Mons — let alone one-shoot them — before a very long time. I finally had her learn Psyshock before the trade, just for the sake of smoothing out her debut — and my early run. With that, she was able to make mincemeat out of the opposition right away and to stockpile levels.Talking about levels, I made a dire mistake during those very early stages of my run. Upon receiving my little Chamallow, I immediately proceeded to raise up her affection in Pokemon Amie in order to get the XP boost. I reasoned that this boost, combined with her fast levelling-up rate, would allow me to skip many Trainers and zoom unhindered through Kalos. Alas, I forgot a crucial variable in that equation: the Trade XP boost, which made Chamallow level up even faster. And thus I found myself in a very weird and unprecedented situation where my One and 'Monly gained levels too fast. I had to pace myself like never before, skipping every single non-mandatory Trainer between Santalune and Coumarine. I kid you not. I got some respite after that and could fight a bit more, before things got hairy again right before Snowbelle. After that, I was mercifully free from all Obedience obligations; but lord, was it aggravating to go full stealth mode for so long. I initially wanted to go faster, but I ultimately ended up tiptoeing and trembling at the sight of a Trainer — how ironic! Anyway, that's a lesson: never combine Trade, Pokemon Amie and Fast leveling rate — you can have two of them, but all three is a recipe for disaster. Let's now talk about Moves, shall we? Clefairy is pretty well-endowed when it comes to learnsets, and I wielded a couple of different Move pools over the course of my run. See for yourselves (new additions are in red):Move Pool #1: Psybeam, Pound, Wake-up Slap, Metronome Move Pool #2: Psybeam, Wake-Up Slap, Return, Magic LeafMove Pool #3: Psybeam, Wake-Up Slap, Return, ThunderboltMove Pool #4: Psybeam, Dazzling Gleam, Firethrower, ThunderboltMove Pool #5: Psybeam, Dazzling Gleam, Firethrower, Ice BeamMetronome sounded pretty good on paper; but since I couldn't control usable Moves as tightly as with Assist, the cracks quickly showed and I ditched it without regret. As for Flamethrower, I stumbled upon it in Anistar City's Pokemon Centre, as I talked to the Hex Maniac at just the right time. I never found that TM in Kalos before, and it was a real boon for the Pokemon League. Which, for the record, was a breeze — just like all the Gyms before it, as a matter of fact. And good old Psybeam was in my pool from beginning to end! Heck, I don't think I've ever hanged onto a Move that long in a solo run before. Of course, that setting was a tad artificial, but it was fulfilling nonetheless; and ultimately, it's really all that matters, ain't it? Long story short: Clefairy rocks. She has great offensive stats and the learnset to match, pretty decent defensive stats, and a crap ton of HP. Her only weakness is her pitiful speed; but being oveleveled, I still managed to outspeed most of Kalos' fauna. Here's to you, Melanie: the Clefairy Solo Run you'll never tackle! As for me, that's one more X&Y solo run under my belt, and a jolly good one at that; and now, we're gonna move on to something less cute — shall I say darker? Stay tuned for the upcoming run report, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Manectric Solo Run", "date": "11/08/2020", "text": "It's safe to say that at that point, I've wanted to cruise with Gen III's signature Electric 'Mon for years; however, there were always flashier 'Mons that caught my fancy, and I kept delaying that run. But no more: it's finally Manectric's time to shine on the battlefield, and show if it's as electrifying as its counterpart Luxray. I must admit I had reservations: Manectric always seemed incredibly frail to me — heck, I cannot remember not one-shooting it in my runs — and I harboured serious doubts about its viability as a lone ranger. However, I needn't have worried: Manectric quickly became a force to be reckoned with, all the more so with Mega Evolution slapped on top — because of course, I had to cruise with the mega-evolved version. You didn't expect less from me, did ya?My little Orage and her Manectite hailed from my Omega Ruby cartridge — courtesy of X, my breeding cartridge for this summer, not hosting Electrike in the wild. Luckily enough, I didn't have to worry about Orage leveling up too fast: Manectric's Slow leveling rate made sure that I never had to worry about hitting that darn Obedience cap — on the contrary, I could raise my Orage's affection in Pokemon Amie and use the Lucky Egg like it was going out of fashion. My lone ranger boasted the Static Rod ability, which was properly awesome and made her even deadlier on the battlefield — with the added bonus that she was not paralyzed a single time during my run. She was blessed with a Brave nature, i.e. higher Attack and lower Speed; with the latter being Manectric's higher stat and the benefit of overleveling, it could totally suffer a bit of lowering. That made my Orage a perfect mixed attacker, which allowed me to make the most of her non-negligible set of Physical Moves. And since I'm mentioning Moves, I got a nice surprise in that department — or more like plenty of them, really. Manectric's learnset is buzzing (har har) with Electric Moves, both Special and Physical; with a whopping five offensive Electric Moves to choose from in her leveling-up learnset only, I made the most of the opportunity and wielded them all in turns. I finally settled on Thunderbolt for the game's late stages, along with Return and a Dark-Type Hidden Power; as for the fourth slot, I decided to dedicate it to a Physical Electric Move, and ran to the Move Reminder to relearn Wild Charge. That's when I discovered the presence of Fire Fang in Manectric's learnset, and proceeded to learn it on the spot. Of course, I could have aimed even higher and rolled with Flamethrower; but Fire Fang did a great job, and I was happy to exploit Manectric's 'natural' learnset.And mind you, it's not like I direly needed the most powerful TMs out there: with Mega evolution in tow, my Orage was basically unstoppable. Cherry on the cake, I really loved her mega-evolved design — so much so that I wish it could have been her final evolutionary stage instead of a mere ME. And since I'm mentioning design, I didn't quite fancy Manectric's looks. Electrike was quite adorable, and Mega Manectric was sleek and gorgeous as heck; Manectric, on the other hand, looked pretty unremarkable to me. It's a bit too small, with too many bits sticking out and a weird posture; and don't get me started on its ears, which look kinda gross and out of place. Good thing I could switch to Mega Manectric whenever I wanted to and please my retinas. I don't have much to add about Orage's battle prowess, really: her lowest point was Cyllage's Rock Gym, and after gaining the Mega Ring in Shalour, it was pretty much one-shooting until the end.And so, Manectric totally exceeded my expectations and proved to be stellar solo run material; and as far as regional Electric 'Mons go, it certainly fares better than its statistically-crippled Gen IV counterpart Luxray. And with that, the Pokemon Summer 2020 keeps rolling; stay tuned for more solo goodness, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Omega Ruby: The Delcatty solo run", "date": "03/08/2020", "text": "So, I'm back to ORAS again, after ditching my Delcatty solo run one year ago. The reason for that most unexpected comeback is pretty simple: I recently discovered that ORAS are an utter and complete treasure trove of 'Mons that are incredibly hard, if not impossible, to find in other games. Glameow, Larvesta, Lopunny, Ponyta, Deerling, Clefairy: you name them, they roam Gen VI Hoenn. Heck, even super-duper rare Venomoth itself can be found in the wild in ORAS! And don't get me started on all the Mega Stones lying around, which are just begging to be picked up and slapped on my next One and 'Monly. Mega Audino, here I come! Anyway, pair that sheer wealth of 'Mons and MS with the very convenient possibility to trade with X&Y and pretty lenient Obedience conditions, and you get a massive amount of potential Gen VI solo runs.Well, now you have.Of course, gaining access to that treasure trove of solo runs involved finishing at least one run of ORAS; and if you remember well, Omega Ruby and I didn't exactly part on the best of terms. However, I had an inkling at the time that I could like ORAS with a bit of tweaking — namely, to treat it as its own unique game, and to avoid playing it back-to-back with Ruby and Sapphire. Luckily, I hadn't erased my OR save file from last year; and so, I was able to dive right back into my aborted Delcatty run and to finish it in one smooth, clean go. And mind you, it didn't even hurt; in fact, I daresay that I really enjoyed OR this time around. Not touching Gen III for a whole year really cleaned up my memories of Hoenn, allowing me to start anew with OR and to appreciate it on its own merits. It's still too early to elaborate on my impressions of those remakes; but I'll sure get around to it once a have a couple of runs under my belt.At any rate, I enjoyed the second half of that Delcatty solo run, and I took the purple feline all the way to the Elite Four and beyond. And it wasn't even that hard, too! Although I had left my Delcatty with a crappy Move pool made of Secret Power, Assist, Feint Attack and Dig, I had no problem progressing and vanquishing the opposition. And with my run firmly back on track, I launched into the Great Quest to Get a Decent Move Pool. Mind you, my Move pool from last year was serviceable enough: Secret Power hit quite hard with added status effect bonus, and Assist allowed me to access six extra Moves — Surf, Brick Break, Strength, Cut, Fly and Dragon Breath. However, I wouldn't be able to rely on Assist during the final showdown; and thus I needed more Move options.There's no such thing as 'too much water' — but more on that in a future post. Yup, teaser!And thus began the most backtracky fetch fest of them all, which had me Flying, Surfing and Diving all around Hoenn to get my hands on a measly four TMs that didn't even have the decency to fully exploit my Améthyste's stats. See for yourself:Shadow Ball: Inside Mt. Pyre's — probably the easiest to find.Thunderbolt: In New Mauville; obtained by running an errand for Wattson, after beating Primal Groudon. Ice Beam: In Sea Mauville, obtainable only with Dive.Return: Available only in Pacifidlog, i.e. at End Game's door. RSE let you get a second Return TM from Professor Cozmo in Fallarbor; ORAS offers no such convenience and forces you to go all the way to Pacifidlog. Those four Moves made the cut to the Pokemon League; they could have been a dope set indeed, if not for the fact that my Delcatty boasted a Careful nature and thus a lowered Sp. Attack — meaning that she couldn't make the most of Shadow Ball, Thunderbolt and Ice Beam. And since I Moon-Stoned her before she hit lv. 46 and learnt Play Rough, I was stuck with a mere single Physical Move to exploit her most powerful offensive stat. Now, did this hinder me in any way? Not at all; I steamrolled the Elite Four and the Champion just the same — and all the other Trainers before them, for that matter. All's well that ends well.At any rate, I now have a finished OR run under my belt, which means that the stage is set for serial recruiting, breeding, MS-picking and trading. Ditto being kinda hard to find in ORAS — how very ironic indeed — I already recruited a specimen in X and sent him to my OR cartridge for immediate breeding purposes. As for the other half, I have a number of runs already lined up; but for suspense's sake, I'll keep the identity of my future One and 'Monlies under wraps until I post my reports. Until then, dear fellow gamers, keep playing and take care!"},
{"title": "Animal Crossing - New Horizons: 50 days", "date": "29/07/2020", "text": "Surprise surprise, dear fellow gamers: I'm being playing ACNH casually for the last 50 days, totalling a respectable 40 hours of play — and lo and behold, I really like it. Before I elaborate on that (kinda unexpected) last point, I should explain what I mean by 'playing casually': we're talking about 15 to 30 minutes of daily play, centered mostly on foraging, selling stuff and socializing. It's worth noting that I'm taking my sweet time here, doing just what I feel like doing and nothing more each day, and not worrying one bit about hitting gameplay milestones. If I wanna spend a whole playing session harvesting wood and then call it a day, then that's exactly what I do. As a result, my island's urbanization is progressing at a most languid pace: my second batch of fellow islanders moved in a mere week ago, and I just barely unlocked the Town Hall.'Playing casually' also involves not obsessing over money-making schemes and debt repayment. The loans are not going anywhere, and it doesn't matter if I pay them in two days or two weeks; what matters is that I have fun with my daily dose of NH and play it my way. One of my little pleasures is to finish each session with an empty inventory, ready to be refilled the next day; another is to fly to a Mystery Island, strip the place of all its resources, fly back and sell all my loot in one fell swoop. I know I'd get more money if I crafted stuff from those resources and sold it; but it's tedious, so I'll rather keep the materials — and the fun — intact. Heck, I don't care about time anyway: I might be in for the long run, so better save some stuff to do for later.This is undoubtedly the main difference between my runs of New Leaf and New Horizons: this time around, I have things to do — meaning both things I can do and things I want to do. While I struggled to find interesting activities in New Leaf and had absolutely nothing to look forward to, I have a batch of long-term goals in New Horizons on top of my daily grind. NH is much more RPG-ish than NL, to yours truly's delight — heck, paying back Tom Nook alone is enough of a objective to keep me going. As for other differences between New Leaf and New Horizons, I can gladly say that everything — and I mean everything — that bothered me in the former is blissfully gone from the latter. No more villagers that force me to rendezvous with them one real-time hour later, no more boring never-changing Tropical Island, no more guilt-tripping because I didn't play for a couple of days — and boy, is NH all the better for it. Since I just played for 50 days and 40 hours and just unlocked the Town Hall, the time is perfect to take a small break from NH, take stock of what I've accomplished and build up anticipation about what's to come. Other games are calling me anyway; and as you know, my gaming instinct runs the show! Still, I'm really glad I could already enjoy NH so much, because that was far from being a given considering my history with the series. Hopefully the best is yet to come; until then, dear fellow gamers, I'll see you soon with some fresh gaming goodness!"},
{"title": "Pokemon X: The Pyroar solo run", "date": "25/07/2020", "text": "Dear fellow gamers, the Pokemon Summer 2020 Season is now officially open! Kickstarting that new round of solo runs is my annual revisitation of X&Y, starring a 'Mon I've wanted to cruise with for the longest time: Pyroar, the somewhat-out-of-place, somewhat-statistically-impaired Kalos lion. I rolled with the lioness for convenience's and aesthetics' sake — said lioness being more abundant on the field and more pleasing to my retinas — and was lucky enough to land a specimen with a Bashful Nature, which means that I could experience the purest, truest-to-form version of Pyroar.Let's address the elephant in the room right away: yes, Pyroar's stats distribution is kinda off, and it makes its hidden ability totally useless. You can see for yourself the vertiginous gap between my Fiamma's Attack and Special Attack: we're talking about a whopping 89 points here, which I'm sure is one of the highest Attack stat discrepancy I've ever encountered in a solo run. Now for the million-dollar question: did it hinder me? Nope, not in the slightest. Fiamma basically blazed through Kalos, burning every living thing to a crisp and one-shooting the entire Elite Four — bar five 'Mons that pulled off the exploit of lasting two turns.Of course, that battle prowess required a fair bit of tweaking. Pyroar's learnset is pretty shallow and infested with Physical Moves; and to make matters worse, it takes her forever to learn powerful Special Moves through levelling-up — the first Special above 40 power being Flamethrower, at lv. bloody 38. With Rock Smash, Ember and Echoed Voice, my early Move pool was nothing to brag about; and with Pyroar's Attack being so shitty, the arrival of Take Down, Fire Fang, Crunch and Return painfully failed to turn the tables. Faced with such inefficience, I decided to go Special all the way; and that's how I finally ended with Incinerate, Flamethrower, Hyper Voice and Dark Pulse — renouncing my beloved Return along the way.With that battery of Special Moves, my French lioness could live up to her full potential; but I can understand why it failed to make an impression back in the days — and later, for that matter. Getting my late kickass Move pool took ridiculously high levels and an awfully long time — and mind you, that was with the benefit of running solo. Let's just say that GameFreak is keeping up with the tradition of sneaking in trolly, stat-misfitted 'Mons in every game, and that Pyroar is Gen VI's Pidove.Still, I had a blast with Pyroar, and that run was a most delicious appetizer. Because indeed, I'm nowhere near sated; more solo runs will be tackled this summer, both in X&Y and other entries. And talking about this: back to da grind! See you soon for (much) more Pokemon goodness, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, feel free to drop clever and challenging One and 'Monly suggestions in the comments!"},
{"title": "Long-arse games I wanna play again", "date": "17/07/2020", "text": "The title says it all, really; but I'm still gonna elaborate, just because I can. When I say 'long-arse games', I mean playthroughs ranging from 50 hours to 200-or-so; such lengths should make those games one-run-only experiences for weak little me, who starts feeling gaming fatigue around the 30-hour mark. And yet, I want to play those games again, at least once — and maybe more, who knows. You musn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling! Dragon Quest IX: A.k.a. the Don of long runs as far as my gaming career is concerned. I spent roughly 210 hours on that game, and I was nowhere near done when I stopped. Okay, that's a bit of an embellishment: I was actually very close to being done, since I was buried deep in Grottoes slaughtering Metal King Slimes by the dozen. Still, I stopped because other matters required my urgent attention at the time, not because I was bored; if not for that untimely interruption, my run might have boasted a couple more hours. Anyway, I wanna solo that game again. Because it means a lot to me, being one of the first RPGs I played after my Second Coming of Gaming; because it has an unique atmosphere I still remember fondly; and simply because I love it. Since I combed the game world with the Strategy Game by my side during my first run, mastering all Classes and collecting nearly all the available gear, my second run would be much swifter. I would simply master the most useful skills and Classes for a solo endeavour, grind a bit at chosen spots, skip all the postgame, and voilà! I used to be afraid of not being able to choose a different MC after spending so many hours with my original one; but after eight years of not touching the game, I've kinda forgotten her, and I'll gladly craft a new MC from scratch — a male one, this time. Hometown Story: I know that game's nothing to write home about (easy-lousy pun a million times intended), being bristling with flaws and boasting a most horrendous Metacritic score of 47; and yet, I have the fondest memories of my 70-hours-or-so run. I remember scouring the whole village for ressources, I remember rushing and running around in my shop to refill shelves until I became slightly delirious, I remember the sweet dingling sound of the cash register; and most importantly, I remember loving that game, and having great fun playing it. I really wanna live the shopkeeper's life again at some point — once again, preferably with the male character that time around.  Atelier Ayesha: A.k.a. the game that made me fall in love with the Atelier series in earnest, after a number of tepid experiences with the Arland entries. My heart still flutters with a wondrous sort of wanderlust everytime I remember the gorgeous Dusk vistas; and I still have a number of potential party members unhandled despite playing two runs back-to-back — and don't get me started on all those endings I still have to uncover. And of course, beyond all that, I simply love Ayesha's whole atmosphere so much that I really wanna bask into it again. And lucky (and industrious) me, I just got my paws on Play-Asia's Atelier Dusk Trilogy Deluxe Pack and its most convenient multi-language option! It's the third time I'm buying that darn game, but I love it so much I'm not even salty.Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory: It's been hardly a year since I polished off my 50-plus-hours run of Hacker's Memory; and yet, I wanna play it again. I absolutely adored it, and still do; in fact, I daresay that I love it even more than when I played it last summer. There's something quite unique about that gem of a game, something that makes me wanna dive right back into it again — and purchase every single Digimon portable entry while I'm at it. At any rate, it's now safe in my precious collection, to be played and treasured for all eternity, after I secured the rare and much-coveted physical edition of the Digimon Story Cybersleuth: Complete Edition for the Switch. Yet another game I've bought twice — but gosh, was it utterly worth it.There you have it, dear fellow gamers: the games I'll definitively replay one fine day, despite having spent way too many hours on them already. It goes without saying that I'd love to read about the ludicrously long games you really wanna tackle again — please feel free to humour me in the comments! I'll see you very soon with more gaming goodness — because indeed, as promised, I finally got my life back and I'm gaming again with a passion. Until next time, take care and keep playing!"},
{"title": "Drowning in giddiness and games", "date": "06/07/2020", "text": "I've announced the upcoming end of my collecting endeavours on that blog many times already. There was a time when I truly believed it would happen soon indeed; but now, I've finally come round, and I can safely claim that my collecting is nowhere near done yet, and won't be as long as there are handhelds around. Why, this feels like a coming-out of sorts! I feel much lighter now that I fully and shamelessly acknowledged my roaring collecting impulses. Roaring indeed: a mere six month after getting my beloved Switch Lite, I already own 35 Switch games — and counting. Counting very fast indeed, because my Switch To-Buy List is growing by the month, each purchased game being replaced by two future releases. Not that I'm complaining, mind you; my appetite for Switch games is enormous — so enormous that it took the jaded collector in me by surprise. I never though I could feel that much passion for collecting again, so long after the giddy, intoxicating early stages of my collecting; and I certainly never, ever thought a Nintendo handheld, of all systems, could elicit such a a burning collecting passion, so soon after my lukewarm experiences with the 3DS and the original Switch. Dare I say I'm immensely grateful for that unexpected change of collecting fortunes? Yup, I dare. That rekindled collecting passion is even pouring onto my older collections, which I deemed mostly complete — until I suddenly found games that I totally couldn't live without a second longer. Games like Sol Trigger for the PSP, or Atelier Sophie and Firis and Digimon Next Order for the Vita, which all joined my precious collection lately.With all that gaming goodness piling up, it's all the more frustrating that I can hardly play these days. Other matters are claiming my attention urgently, forcing me to put my barely started run of Pokemon X on hold and to delay my eagerly awaited run of Three Houses — not to mention all the other runs I'm itching to tackle. Yet, I know all that wait and frustration will make the ultimate release even sweeter and better. That ultimate release should happen in roughly a week; and you can bet your sweet life that I'm gonna play with abandon and a vengeance then. See you soon with fresh gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers, and take care!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Echoes - Shadows of Valentia: Ce n'est qu'un au revoir", "date": "26/06/2020", "text": "After a bit of meandering, my gaming instinct's verdict is now clear: I'm done with FEE for the time being. I might have forged on if Berkut were the final boss; but given that he's not and that there's still another — short, but still — whole act after him, I'm throwing in the towel. When I play FEE again (because indeed, I'll definitely replay that hidden gem of a game), I'll make sure to grind early on; and since I know now what to expect, that second run will undoubtedly be much more streamlined and satisfying.Not that my first run wasn't satisfying already, mind you; in fact, I daresay that Echoes is my favourite FE entry so far. Apart from all the goodness I mentioned in my first post, I'm extremely fond of a number of playthrough-altering features. Those include the absence of offspring units, which is a blessing in disguise as far as I'm concerned because it spares me the cumbersome task of playing matchmaker on the battlefield. They also include the wonderful possibility to play with all units at all times, sparing me the heartbreak of ditching some promising characters along the way — and the hassle of replaying the game just to cruise with them. And how could I not mention the deeply and wonderfully strategic battles, which forced me to get out of my comfort 'charging like a bull' zone and rack my brain in earnest to make it out alive?On the 'room for improvement' side, I would have liked an exhaustive quest log to save me from all the blind backtracking I had to endure to fulfill sidequests, as well as the possibility to hold more than one item per unit. More subtle and developed storytelling would also have been a must, especially during segments such as (SPOILERS!) Alm's and Celica's conflictual second parting, which loses all its emotional impact because of how shockingly rushed it is, or Alm's discovery of his lineage, which is digested way too fast and smoothly. (END of SPOILERS) Well, at least I cannot complain about cutscenes overstaying their welcome, now can I?Of course, a FE wrap-up post wouldn't be complete without a list of my favourite units. I'll keep the finer details for my next run reports; for the time being, suffice it to say that Alm, Celica, Lukas, Clair, Python, Mathilda, Clive, Tatiana, Zeke, Leon and Sonya were absolute little darlings of mine for reasons both futile and profound, ranging from their looks to their battle prowess. FEE contains little romance, and certainly no active wooing the player can perform; however, that didn't prevent me from indulging in a darling little FE habit of mine, i.e. spotting a couple with potential and rooting for them. And so, my own Best Couple Award for Echoes goes to Tatiana and Zeke, a pair that's both sweetly endearing and hot as heck. We'll see if Celica and Alm, another couple I really fancy, end up stealing the top spot once I'm done with the story. I also kinda ship Clair and Lukas, despite them not being a canon pairing; and Mathilda and Clive manage the tour de force to be classy and hilarious at once, which earns them an honourable mention in my FEE couple ranking.Long story short: I love that game, I'll certainly replay it again, and I'll finish is while I'm at it. For now, new gaming shores are beckoning — or maybe not so new indeed, if I obey my gaming instinct that currently presses me to play Three Houses. See ya soon with more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Echoes - Shadows of Valentia: What now?", "date": "19/06/2020", "text": "My first 25 hours of FEE went by without a hitch. Sure, there were a couple of tough battles here and there, some of which I barely escaped alive; but overall, it was smooth sailing. However, things took a turn for the worst upon entering the Fifth Act: that basterd Berkut sent me packing, wiping away a good chunk of my advance in the process. I was rightfully salty, but also a bit discouraged: to encounter sudden resistance after nearly a whole run spent progressing swiftly is ten times more disheartening than to struggle right off the bat. The game led me to expect an easy ride all the way to the end, and now it's slapping me in the face with tough-as-nails battles? Not fair! This sudden change of gaming fortunes led me to take a step back and ponder my next move. After a bit of musing, I see four courses of action: To put my run on hold: Not only do I feel like I've had my fill of FEE already, but Three Houses is stamping its feet and screaming for attention. Wouldn't it be better, then, to humour my gaming instinct and come back to FEE later with a fresh mind and renewed fondness? To force my way through: Berkut was nearly done for when he put an end to my prowess — and progress — by nastily taking Alm down; this makes me think that I could win that battle with a bit of strategic tweaking. Of course, I would hate to cross the Temple of Duma only to lose again against Berkut; but still, that's definitely worth trying.To grind like a beast: A.k.a. Me Life and my go-to solution when I struggle in an RPG. I could go back to the Fear Mountain Shrine and farm some Silver Marks there to improve my weapons. That dungeon also hosts a Cantor, which is a most convenient foe for grinding purposes: its sole move is to summon Gargoyles, thus providing potentially endless waves of leveling-up fodder. The only thing that stops me from running there right away is the game's stinginess when it comes to granting XP; with my crew boasting the levels they boast, it could take hours before I manage to buff them enough to steamroll Berkut.To restart a more streamlined run: A very tempting option, I must admit. I resorted to it when playing Fates, and it just saved everything — my run, my fun, my love for that game, you name it. Not only that, but I really enjoyed Echoes' early stages, and I totally wouldn't mind replaying them again with added mastery of the gameplay's ins and outs.I'm still on the fence right now, with all four options looking equally appetizing. I'll tell you more when my gaming instinct is done settling the matter, dear fellow gamers; until then, take care and keep gaming!"},
{"title": "Games I love that I will never play again ", "date": "15/06/2020", "text": "The (awesome) idea for that post came from my talented fellow gamer and blogger Geddy, who developed it first on his (no less awesome) blog Nostalgia Trigger. It was just so good that I had to make a version of my own; without further ado, dear fellow gamers, here are my 'Games I love that I will never play again'!Balloon Kid: Not only is that game one of the highlights of my formative gaming years, but it has plenty of things going for it. Those range from its innovative and stellar physics, which were groundbreaking at the time and still are to this day, to its wonderfully evocative soundtrack — including that impossibly wholesome masterpiece, which remains one of my favourite pieces of gaming music ever and will probably forever be. And I cannot not mention its first level, which encompasses everything first levels should be about: the giddiness, the wonderment, the feeling of discovery, the joy of being ushered in a new world. As though all this were not enough, I also have a special and unique memory tied to BK: one fine mid-'90s afternoon, my cousin and I decided to join forces and finish the game, which up to that point was still unbeaten by both of us. We found ourselves a quiet little spot under the shade of a tree, and took turns playing; and lo and behold, we finally beat the darn game by the skin of our teeth, after nearly dying a thousand times. Epic! I just have to love that game, because it means so much to me; and yet, I really don't want to replay it ever again. The only part I truly enjoy playing is the first level, and I know the layout so well that I could nearly do so with my eyes closed; that's not nearly enough to motivate me to get my paws on a cartridge, let alone to actually play it.Luminous Arc: I had a blast playing that SRPG back in 2017. The leveling system was deliciously broken, which led to one of my longest and most ridiculously massive grinding bouts ever; and although I ultimately failed to subdue the final boss, I was left totally sated by my 20 hours of LA. So sated, in fact, that I don't feel the need to touch that game ever again. I mean, I power-grinded the MC all the way up to lv.99; what could there be left to accomplish, apart from following a story I don't care one bit about and vanquishing a final boss I don't care one bit about either? Add to this a cumbersome control scheme and a glacial battle pace, and you'll understand why I don't want to play Luminous Arc ever again despite having only good memories of it. As a matter of fact, I'm so sure of my decision here that I pawned my cartridge not long after my playthrough. When I'm in the mood for some LA again, I can roll with the three sequels, which I all own, and let the original be a 'once in a lifetime' experience. Myst III Exile: Unlike the other entries on my list, this one never appeared on the blog, and for good reason: I played it in 2009, when diving back into gaming was but a bittersweet dream and blogging about it was lightyears away from my radar. Emulation was my only tenuous link with gaming at the time; yet that summer 2009, I managed to get my paws on a physical copy of Myst III, and immediately proceeded with playing it as I was conveniently on holidays. I spent the next three weeks glued to the game, gobbling pots of (insert name of famous Italian hazelnut spread) to give me fuel for the brain; and since I had no internet at the time, I had to rely on the power of said brain alone to take me through the game. It was arduous, but I finally succeeded — creating one of my most memorable playthroughs ever in the process. I still remember those days with vivid clarity: the summer heat and light, the spoons of hazelnut spread, the feeling of constant challenge, the joy of finally solving a puzzle and, most importantly, the game's unique atmosphere, which sucked me in and made me totally obsessed with it. That playthrough was so deeply mesmerizing that I don't want to ever touch Myst III again, because I know fully well that subsequent runs wouldn't feel so utterly magical. And with the game having never been ported to any console, it's not like I risk stumbling upon it, now is it? Xenoblade Chronicles 2: You knew this one was coming, didn't ya? I had the most passionate relationship of them all with XC2, going from loving it to pieces to getting sick of it — and everything in between. Today, my gamer's heart made its peace with XC2, and I can think back on my run(s) with great fondness. However, when I imagine myself actually replaying the game, I find myself paralyzed with utter and complete refusal — heck, the mere though of running again through the Tantal snows or the Leftheria sands is enough to make me nauseous, and that's with me loving those landscapes. There were tons of things I adored about XC2, from the slick fighting system to the grandiose vistas; yet I cannot bring myself to even think of experiencing all that goodness again.This goes to show that even though I'm a total serial game replayer, I have my limits like everyone else. Of course, we never know what the future has in store for us, and maybe I'll replay one of those games after a couple of years; but for now, they stand firmly on my 'rest in peace' list. Don't hesitate to share your own list in the comments, dear fellow gamers — and see you soon with more gaming goodness!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Echoes - Shadows of Valentia: Is this love that I'm feeling?", "date": "07/06/2020", "text": "Why, of course it's love. There's no way I couldn't love a Fire Emblem entry that's delighfully simple, straightforward and streamlined, and as mercifully light on story as it's deliciously heavy on combat. There's no way I wouldn't love a FE entry that's said to be one of the shortest in the series, yet still offers plenty of strategic nuance by boasting two different sets of units — and letting me switch at will between them. And there's just no way in heck I won't adore a FE entry that lets me slash my way through dungeons.That last point requires further development, because it's so impossibly awesome that I have to rave copiously about it. Long story short, FEE offers complimentary dungeons to crawl, in which you can farm stuff and swing your sword at things — think slash grass à la Zelda, or strike foes first to get an edge in battle à la Atelier. Not even in my wildest dreams would I have dared imagine a FE instalment with an A-RPG fighting system — let alone a stellar A-RPG fighting system. Because indeed, real-time combat in FEE is irresistibly satisfying: not only are the physics amazing and a feast for the fingers, but the animations are gorgeous and a feast for the eyes. The whole thing is just so darn perfect that I seriously wish there were more of it — like, the whole game. Nah, just kidding; regular battles are excellent too, so I wouldn't want to miss on them. On the other hand, this makes me reassess my purchase of Fire Emblem Warriors. I bought that game a couple of years ago on a whim, and always kinda regretted that purchase; but after experiencing FEE's thrilling real-time combat segments, I find myself eager to play that unlikely crossover after all.Slashing and hacking is not all there is to FEE's dungeons, though. You can also farm stuff there, either by destroying pots and crates conveniently lying around or by looking for items thanks to a point-and-clicky sight. And you'd better farm dutifully indeed, because this is the only way to get your paws on replenishing items and new gear, as well as the most efficient way to get forging currency and items for side quests. Because indeed, there are side quests in FEE! Have I ever played an FE game with side quests — beyond the usual 'go there and recruit that extra unit' thing, that is? I don't think so, and I relish that novelty — even though a quest journal would have been much appreciated. With all that, you'd nearly forget that we're dealing with an SRPG there. But don't worry, dear fellow gamers: I love the strategy side of FEE just as much as its ARPG side. It's a real pleasure to be immersed in the series' unique atmosphere again, and to savour its distinctive brand of combat without a care in the world thanks to the forgiving 'no permadeath' setting. I tackled Celica's path first, until I was blocked at the sluice gate and had to progress things on Alm's side; and with hindsight, I kinda regret not having cleared one battle at a time on each side. The map on Alm's side is now teeming with strong extra brigades that make my progression much harder — heck, I'm lucky if I manage to escape those battles with more than a quarter of my force still standing. Things are so tedious that I'm seriously thinking of promoting my eligible units right now — all the more so as hitting the lv. 20 cap before changing class supposedly matters less in FEE than in your regular FE entry. Let's get to it, shall we? Until I see you again with a fresh run report, take care and keep gaming!"},
{"title": "Final Fantasy II: Final thoughts", "date": "02/06/2020", "text": "Oh, is that so? Let me take that bauble off your hands then.This is it, folks: the emperor is destroyed, and my country is free again. Hooray! That last stretch was a piece of cake, honestly. For once, my party was outrageously overleveled, and pimped up with the finest gear to boot. That finest gear included the HP-sucking Blood Sword, which made the final showdown ridiculously smooth: I just let Firion lash out with that fabulous blade while Guy and Maria healed the whole crew, and the whole thing was over in less than ten turns with nobody kicking the bucket. Easy-peasy! For another, I used maps to navigate most of the last dungeon. It was a slick and sweet piece of crawling, yes it was; and it was not even really cheating, since I still bore the brunt of that crawling by vanquishing the endless waves of foes crashing on my party. I daresay that this experience even opened a new door for me, and that maybe I'll use walkthroughs and FAQs more readily from now on. FFII reminded me of Trails in the Sky in more ways than one. I already praised the lovingly detailed and very Nihon Falcom-ish graphics; I can also praise the Guest system, which saw the fourth spot in my party being occupied by a slew of temporary party members. The fact that a good half of them left the party by kicking the bucket added a suitably harrowing element to my liberating epic; needless to say, I'll be more than happy to play Soul of Rebirth and cruise with those fallen heroes again. (Not right now, though: I've had my fill of all things FFII for the time being.)And since I'm mentioning the story, I must say that it was unfortunately too disjointed to live up to its full potential. Not only did it include way too many in medias res elements for comfort, but the (rare) in-game events didn't even get a decent development. (SPOILERS!) Like, shouldn't there be a long and serious heart-to-heart about Leon's life as the Emperor's Dark Knight? I know the world is in dire danger, but are we just gonna brush this off without even checking his motivations for such a turnaround? Looks like it indeed! Heck, I really wanted to know if he was blackmailed, brainwashed or hypnotized into becoming the Emperor's peon, or if he did it on his own free will for some obscure and unspeakable reason. Guess I'll have to fill in the blanks myself then, and craft my own little story about Leon! (END OF SPOILERS.) All in all, FFII really calls for a sequel AND a prequel to clarify things on the narrative front. So, did I love FFII? Absolutely. Would I recommend it? Yes and no. It has plenty of things going for it, and the 27 hours I spent playing it were utterly delicious; but the harsh truth is that FFII is really just a total fighting fest. Don't like grinding and crawling? Too bad, so sad — because there is literally nothing else to do in that game. The story is too evanescent and inconsequent to matter, and the open world is too shallow and empty to enthrall; if those things matter to you, then you should avoid FFII at all costs. But if you live for grinding and have a serious itch to scratch in that department, then FFII is your game indeed! Heck, it scratched my own grinding itch so thoroughly that I'm totally in the mood for more story-infused stuff now. And so, on to the next game!"},
{"title": "Yo-kai Watch: Definitely not for me", "date": "27/05/2020", "text": "Next pawning indeed.Let's set the scene, dear fellow gamers: as I was hovering around the Nintendo area in a supermarket for the first time in weeks, I suddenly spotted the Yo-kai Watch 2 pair of games. Remembering that this was the only famous monster - collecting series I had not touched yet, I was tempted to just pounce and grab them — of only because it had been so darn long since I last secured a game in a brick and mortar store. Fortunately, I managed to hold myself back, thanks to the very sensible thought that I'd better check first if the series was my cup of tea at all.That's how I found myself booting up my Yo-kai Watch cartridge that very evening, eager to get my answer. As you guessed already, that answer was resoundingly negative, and the rest of the series won't be granted access to my precious collection indeed. Not only that, but I'm going to pawn my cartridge as soon as I can, because there is virtually no chance I'll ever touch that game again. I won't elaborate since I played for hardly 20 minutes; suffice it to say that the first battle was the decisive point. No matter how tolerant I am towards RPG battle systems, I just cannot accept a battle system that doesn't even let me input commands. Full automatic combat is where I draw the line, folks; and thus Yo-kai Watch and I are not meant together. Needless to say, I'm so glad I didn't purchase the sequels on the spot.Next pick maybe?And now, on to the next playthrough, which will hopefully be longer and more conclusive! I just finished FFII and started Animal Crossing: New Horizons; and, to my utter surprise, I find myself really wanting to play Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition. The gaming instinct wants what it wants, indeed; and if this bewildering choice of its is more than a whim, then I'll be more than happy to comply. I'm also itching for some Fire Emblem; and soon will come the days of my annual revisitation of Pokemon X&Y. I'll see you soon with all that gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers; until then, keep gaming and take care!"},
{"title": "Final Fantasy II: Growing up", "date": "23/05/2020", "text": "I'm shamelessly stealing the title of a post written by my fellow gamer and talented fellow blogger Geddy, because that title describes exactly how I feel about my FFII run right now. The walkthrough I'm following tells me that I've polished off two thirds of the game already, which places the end mark at roughly 25 hours of play. I can deal with that, all the more so as I refined my FFII routine to near perfection. See for yourself the novelties since my last post, dear fellow gamers: — I upgraded my gear, going from Mythril sets to even more powerful stuff: Giant accessories, fancy elemental Armours, deadly weapons such as Orichalcum and Wing Sword — you name it. Thanks to that and to my dutiful grinding, my party is blatantly overleveled, and vanquishing bosses in a matter of turns without major HP depletion — let alone fainting. As you may expect, I'm not complaining.— There was a time when money was hard to come by; but that time is now well and truly over. I'm currently swimming in money à la Scrooge McDuck; and since I'm hardly using any item and hardly purchasing any new gear, I'm saving that money faster than I can spend it. A little bit more, and I'll be able to stock up those absurdly expensive Elixirs for the game's late stages.— The 'Ambushed!' occurrence rate is slowly but surely diminishing. It remains a mite too high for my taste; but it's still much more bearable than a couple of hours ago, when half of the dungeon encounters were Ambushes. That would already be nice enough, but there's more: I'm now getting a Preemptive Strike even now and then. Joy and glory! It may look like I'm going full Stockholm Syndrome, getting overjoyed when the game stops roughing me up and throws me a bone; but don't worry, I'm fully aware that FFII is majorly and laughingly biased against the player, and I'm chuckling at my own masochism. Well, that's is for the new stuff. My run is pretty much on autopilot now, with only the occasional surprise to stir me from my grinding transe. Surprises such as being ambushed by Green Souls, and... having them healing my party, because that's apparently the only move in their arsenal. Best foes EVAH! Gee, FFII can be a dear when it really wants to, can't it? And now, dear fellow gamers, it's time for me to dive back into my delicious grinding routine. I'll see you later with my 4th — and hopefully last — FFII run report. Take care and keep gaming!"},
{"title": "Final Fantasy II: Smooth sailing", "date": "17/05/2020", "text": "Since I fully embraced cheating, I've been enjoying the sweetest routine with FFII. I first check where I'm supposed to go in the walkthrough I selected; then I walk there while vanquishing every living thing that crosses my path; then I do what I'm supposed to do — rinse and repeat for the last 8 hours. Délicieux! I've progressed nicely since my first post, as you may see:— Each character now has their dedicated weapon: the sword for Firion, the dagger for Maria, the axe for Guy, the mace for the guest party member. This specialization brings back lovely memories of my Octopath Traveler run, and makes me wanna dive right into it again. — Everybody is fully decked out in Mythril gear — weapon, armour, accessories, the whole pimping shebang. I even went as far as to purchase an extra set of Mythril for the guest party member. — I raised my party's stats so ridiculously much that their Defense capped, meaning that it's not affected anymore by Shields. I can thus remove the latter and give the crew two weapons, which will certainly come in handy in tougher fights. — Everybody learnt the Fire, Blizzard, Thunder and Cure spells, and I'm busy making those spells deadlier — or livelier — through focused grinding.Talking about this, did I mention that grinding is smooth as heck in FFII, and pleasurable to the extreme? And it's far from being the only thing I love in that game, oooh yes precious. I love the possibility to take the long or short way when travelling; I love the vastitude of the game world, which awakens sweet feelings of gaming fernweh; I love the charmingly intricate graphics, which are the most exquisitely detailed ones I've seen this side of Nihon Falcom's RPGs; I love the whole atmosphere, which feels pleasantly familiar yet catchingly unique. All that love doesn't prevent me from nursing a couple of pet peeves, which go as such:— The map is too darn hard to reach. Seriously, Squeenix: ○ + select? Why? The map should totally have been on the □ button, instead of the laughingly useless bestiary.— No instant travel between places. Given the scales at work in FFII, that would definitely have been a nice touch. Granted, I love roaming all over the world map; but an instant travel option would have been appreciated, for the rare times I want to speed things up.— Guest party members leaving the party and taking loaned equipement with them. You bloody thieves, you! I have to save and strip them before they take their leave in order to keep my Mythril set for the next guest. — Too many darn 'Ambushed!' occurrences, especially in dungeons. This keeps going even though my party is overleveled and doesn't take any damage; a utter and complete loss of time, that's what it is. — Too much of what I'd dub 'trap rooms' in dungeons. They're dead-ends that don't contain the slightest bit of treasure; the only thing they have to offer is a higher encounter rate, just like those infuriating one-step-one-encounter patches in Final Fantasy I. Did anyone say 'fake longevity'?— The HP depletion when using the Teleport spell: now that's plain mean and unfair, game. To add insult to injury, that spell doesn't work in several locations because reasons, and there's no teleporting item that can replace it.That's a lot of pet peeves alright, but don't worry: they hardly mar my experience of FFII, which is overwhelmingly positive. And talking about this: back to da grind! I'll see you soon with another grinding progress report, dear fellow gamers; in the meantime, take care of yourself and keep gaming!"},
{"title": "Final Fantasy II: Early stages", "date": "11/05/2020", "text": "I was initially planning to give Romancing SaGa 3 the old college try; however, my plans were changed by a seemingly innocuous event. I wanted to get on with pimping up my PSP's library by following Geddy's excellent advice; upon taking the machine out of its pouch, I noticed that the battery was completely depleted. That kinda surprised me, because I was sure I had played my beloved PSP not so long ago. I went looking for my last PSP post — and got the shock of my life: I last played one and a half year ago. One and a half year ago, folks! How is that even possible? Of course, something needed to be done right away, namely giving that poor lonely piece of kit some much-needed love; and that's how I found myself enthusiastically tackling FFII — because indeed, I'm still very much in a grinding mood right now.I've been playing for two hours, and that was more than enough to spot FFII's sheer experimental quality. This is a very daring game, all the more so considering its release date. The original Final Fantasy was content to merely follow in Dragon Quest's footsteps; FFII, on the other hand, walks its own rocky, pioneering path. Not only does it boasts a open world — which, while not entirely unknown in 1988, was still far from being the norm — but it also gloriously introduces the intuitive, non-linear character progression system later featured in the SaGa series. I was seriously astounded by that discovery, because I assumed that all Final Fantasy entries featured a regular leveling-up system and that SaGa was the series that first injected non-linearity in all things leveling-up. But it seems that things didn't happen that way indeed: instead, the non-linear character progression system was rerouted to the SaGa series after debuting in FFII.This raises a number of fascinating questions, such as: why was that system removed so quickly from the FF series? (Educated guess: because players didn't like it, or because Squaresoft wanted to explore it in an ad hoc series, or both.) Was the SaGa series created especially as a vehicle for that system? (Educated guess: most likely.) Beyond that, it lets us imagine what would have happened if FF had kept sporting that system, and fantasize about a totally different RPG landscape: a landscape with no FFVII to introduce us Westerners to J-RPG, where Dragon Quest would be the unamovible turn-based RPG reference, now and for all eternity, and FF would be the forever niche contender. Now that sounds like some seriously good parallel universe stuff.But I digress, dear fellow gamers; let's go back to my run. As much as the gaming historian in me relishes FFII's sheer forwardness and originality, the gamer in me is a tad miffed by that unexpected turn of events. See, I expected an uber linear grindy fest similar to the original FF, which would allow me to lose myself in grinding; instead, I got an avant-garde, non-linear (in every possible sense), where-do-I-go-next-ish RPG. The thing is, this is not what I wanted to play — neither now nor ever. I seriously pondered quitting, until I got a much better idea: cheating! I'm going to run to a walkthrough, and use it to erase all that fake longevity uncertainty regarding what I'm supposed to do and where I'm supposed to go next. Then I can keep the good parts, i.e. da roaming and da grinding. I consider this fair game, especially since FFII plays it nasty by forcing me to rove a world map that's much bigger than it needs to be. Jeez, it seems that the habit of inflating open worlds didn't start with Xenoblade, now did it? With that said, I'll see you soon with a fresh run report, dear fellow gamers. Take care and keep gaming!"},
{"title": "Romancing SaGa 3: Am I missing something here? ", "date": "06/05/2020", "text": "Romancing SaGa 3: a cult classic game, whose recent — and first — arrival on our shores was rightfully celebrated. It's the last, and supposedly most polished instalment, of one of Squaresoft's most cutting-edge subseries (i.e. Romancing), itself part of a mythical experimental series (i.e. SaGa). It's a game that, by all accounts, I should absolutely love: and yet I don't.Not to love a game I fully expected to love is already vexing enough; and to add insult to injury, the things I dislike in RSG3 are aplenty. It starts with the 'revamped' graphics, which erase the original's loveable 16-bit-ness and replace it by an ugly phone game look; it goes on with the unbearably slow battle system, which transforms each fight into an drawn-out chore; it ends with the confusing in medias res story, which is too hard to follow for its own good — and for a choral RPG.And since I'm mentioning this, let me say that I'm also bothered by RSG3's similarities to Octopath Traveler, starting with the Recruitable Party Members system. I know that technically, RSG3 was the pioneer here, and the game that first introduced that system; yet Octopath Traveler was the one I did play first, and it seriously casts a shadow over my experience of RSG3. The gaming historian in me would like to explore RSG3 and uncover what was a groundbreaking novelty at the time; yet the gamer in me isn't having any of it and grumbles that if I really want to play a choral RPG, Octopath Traveler and its quality-of-play improvements would be a much better pick. That being said, I'm not writing off RSG3 just yet. I acutely remember that my first experience of OT was pretty lacklustre as well, and that I needed a good number of tweaks and hours of play before I started enjoying it in earnest. Changing my MC in OT really did the trick, and maybe it could change my fortunes as well in RSG3. The general consensus seems to be that Katarina is the best MC for a beginner; so I'll try rolling with her, all the more so as she was one of the characters I seriously considered — my other picks being Mikhail and Harid, which I tried to no avail. The battle speed and ugly graphics cannot be alleviated, but I can probably get used to them over time. In brief: I'll try again, and if it still doesn't gel, then I'll give up with my conscience clean. And so, back to da grind!"},
{"title": "Bonds of the Skies: Baby's first Kemco RPG", "date": "02/05/2020", "text": "But not the last, perish the thought. I just made my Kemco RPG debut, a whopping 30 years after I played their stuff for the first time; but trust me when I say that indeed, I won't let another 30 years pass until I go Kemco again.We did indeed.Following that heartfelt declaration, I'd like to write a ton about BOTS; but to be honest, that game is kinda hard to describe. The best I can say is that it's perfectly generic, yet perfectly wholesome. It ticks all the 'serviceable RPG that somehow encompasses all 16-bit RPGs' boxes, from the Secret of Mana-ish graphics to the snappy first-person turn-based combat à la Dragon Quest, without forgetting the roamable word map, the stronger gear in every new town and many more charming 16-bit RPG tropes. To put it simply: anything you love(d) in 16-bit RPGs, you'll probably find in BOTS.You'll also find a number of neat quality-of-life improvements that may or may not have been a thing back in the '90s, such as instant save, sidequest end messages, tweakable battle speed and the like. Last but not least, BOTS is pleasantly manageable: in roughly 20 hours, you can accomplish everything there is to accomplish, from maxing out all characters' levels to acquiring every single skill. Not only does the game offer a reasonable number of goals to achieve, but it's also perfectly upfront with said goals. For instance, unlike some RPGs that viciously hide sidequests, BOTS kindly lets you know when you're done polishing off all sidequests — and it lets you know in-game, not as a trophy. It's probably the first time I ever encounter an RPG with completionist velleities that also utterly respects the player's time. A special mention must be given to the narrative, which manages the tour de force to be totally unintrusive yet intensely compelling. In fact, it's probably one of the best story progression I've ever had the joy of following in any RPG, ever. How could they pull that off? How could they offer such clear goals, yet give such delicious leeway to accomplish them? How did they manage to revisit the uber-cliché 'mankind doesn't need gods' theme in such a refreshing and touching way? How did they know exactly where to insert cutscenes in order to get the best emotional impact? How did they manage to create such familiar yet engaging characters? A tour de force, I'm telling you.And then there's the postgame, which is hands down the best postgame I've ever had the joy of playing — and I mean that quite literally, mind you. You know postgame is not my cup of tea, dear fellow gamers: as soon as the credits roll, my drive to play plummets, never to rise again. But not this time: this time, I wanted to keep playing, because Kemco fiendishly designed the most gripping postgame ever. Most gripping because:— It's short. On top of being draining, long postgames have an infuriating way of making the main game look futile and pointless — thus insulting the player who poured time and energy into said main game. BOTS wisely avoids that pitfall and keeps it short and sweet. If you grind dutifully all through the main game, postgame will hardly occupy more than 1/20 of your total playtime — case in point, I spent roughly 30 minutes on it for 20-or-so hours of total play.— It's challenging. Short it may be, but BOTS' postgame is tough as nails nonetheless. It challenges you to a couple of extra bosses, including an final, OP one that I only managed to beat by the teeth of my skin despite being at max level. Needless to say, I lapped it all up.— It's a closure. This is Kemco's true stroke of genius when it comes to BOTS' postgame: to actually make it an epilogue, and to give the player a major role in making it happen. To play an epilogue is just a million times more satisfying than to simply watch it — especially when said epilogue gives you all sorts of warm and fuzzy feelings like BOTS' one. I'll admit it: I even teared up a little. Well, well, well; that's actually a lot of writing for a game that was supposedly hard to describe, ain't it? To sum it up: I loved Bonds of the Skies, and I'm most certainly going to play more Kemco RPGs — maybe in a very near future, because I'm currently in a very grindy mood indeed. I'll see you soon with my gaming instinct's next catch, dear fellow gamers; take care during those rocky times!"},
{"title": "Kemco: Long time no play", "date": "28/04/2020", "text": "Kemco: providing me with delicious gaming moments since 1991. Lo and behold: I'm just done polishing off a Kemco game, dear fellow gamers. Now, why the solemn announcement, you may ask? Well, that's because it's been nearly 30 years since I last played a Kemco game.My first (sweet) brush with Kemco happened in 1991, when I played — and loved — Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle on the Game Boy. Of course, developers' and publishers' names and resumés were the farthest thing from my young mind at the time; but with hindsight, and a quick glance at Kemco's Wikipedia page, I can claim that I didn't play a single game of theirs after that, be it a game they developed or published. That oversight was bound to end, though, as I stumbled one fine day upon Kemco's Asdivine Hearts on Limited Run Games. The cover's Trails in the Sky-ish art first lured me in, and the heavy retro graphics convinced me to hit the Purchase button; and then there was no turning back.One thing leading to another, it wasn't long before I discovered Kemco's insanely long and thick string of budget RPGs, and tasked myself with the mighty fine mission of purchasing as many of them as I possibly could. That's how I ended up acquiring all the titles released on the Vita, as well as the Omnibus collection for the Switch; however, this is but a beginning, as there's a lot of room for improvement on the Android and Switch fronts. Now, this leaves one question opened: why would I even bother with those games, when I have so many greater RPGs at my fingertips (like, literally)? After all, the general consensus seems to be that Kemco's budget RPGs are little more than mass-produced, RPG Maker-ed pieces of crap that aren't worth any self-respecting gamer's time or money. There's more than a kernel of truth in that statement; and yet, I'll gladly throw money at Kemco and gorge on their budget RPGs. The reason is simple: those games manage to capture the essence of what 16-bit RPGs were about and to deliver it in a fulfilling pint-sized format — or, in other words: sometimes an RPG veteran just wants a simple grindy treat, and Kemco's stuff can scratch that itch like no flashy recent RPG ever could. Mind you, my passion for all things Kemco RPG was kinda theoretical until recently: although I had tried my hand at many of them to confirm prospective Limited Run purchases, I had yet to finish one of them entirely. I'm just done doing that — yay, me! — and so: see you soon for my first Kemco RPG run report, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Atelier Sophie: My (great) work here is done", "date": "19/04/2020", "text": "Looks like we have a pattern here, dear fellow gamers. Once again, endgame barged in when I least expected it, leaving me open-mouthed and filling me with wondrous blended feelings of happiness and frustration. Sure enough, there was little left to achieve on the alchemic front when Luard appeared, and he was the only real opponent throughout the whole game; sure enough, the Library of All Creation oozed a Last Dungeon feel, with it encompassing name and powerful mobs; sure enough, I had been playing for more than 50 hours at that point; but pray tell, how was I supposed to know that Luard was the (one and only) Final Boss and that kicking some sense into him would mark the end of the game? He didn't even seem that strong, with his puny 3000 HP; beating him only took two tries — one to test the waters and the real, strategized one — and was no struggle at all. Maybe my playing in Easy Mode and grinding like crazy played a part; but the fact is that I didn't use a single healing item and wrapped up the fight in a mere half-dozen turns. Who said \"To vanquish without peril is to triumph without glory\"? I think it was Corneille, and he obviously never experienced the delight of blazing unhindered through an Atelier game.Au revoir, my lovelies. At any rate, this unexpected closure marks the end of my Sophie endeavours for the time being. I had many things left to do, such as uncovering and synthesizing all recipes, fighting with other party members, customizing Plachta and maxing up everybody's affections; however, all that goodness will have to wait until a next playthrough. With my run clocking at a hefty 54 hours, I've had more than my fill of alchemic deeds already. Sophie was a fantastic game, and I enjoyed every minute of it; now I can only hope that Firis will delight and satiate me just as much. And now, dear fellow gamers, let's sail together towards new gaming shores!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon - Rescue Team DX: An unexpected finale", "date": "15/04/2020", "text": "\"Oh baby baby / How was I supposed to know / That endgame was almost here?\"Well, that took me by surprise. Granted, I had been playing for 25 hours; granted, there were prior narrative hints already; and granted, I had uncovered a hefty 17 dungeons... and yet! The idea that the Sky Tower could be the very last main game dungeon honestly never crossed my mind. I was left gaping at the ending sequence, watching Sakura's and Pika-Cute's goodbyes with stunned and crestfallen eyes; and as the credits rolled, I felt a curious, bittersweet mix of joy and sadness wash over me. It was mission accomplished all right, and I could rightfully be proud of myself; and yet, I was left a bit unsated and vexed about what I saw as a premature ending.Of course, should I want more crawling, the game would be perfectly happy to humour me. Just like its fellow Mystery Dungeon instalment Shiren the Wanderer, Rescue Team DX offers a middle-sized main game supplemented by a ludicrous mass of postgame dungeons, some of them absurdly enormous. We're talking about a whopping 28 dungeons here — including 6 dungeons with 99 floors — for a grand total of 1209 floors. 1209 floors, people! The mere though of tackling those monstrous afters makes me dizzy and faint — which is exactly why I'll wisely abstain from doing it. That being said, I'm still holding onto my save data, just in case I'm in a intense masochistic crawling mood one day.  Anyway, those were 25 lovely hours. Granted, RTDX could have been a mite deeper, both in terms of story and gameplay: its humble GBA and DS Phat origins are still very apparent — so much so that it feels a tad too primitive and simplistic for a Switch game. The pacing could also use some tightening and spicing up — although I may have been distrait, it's embarrassing and not too normal that I couldn't smell the last dungeon coming. But playing RTDX made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside nonetheless; and that's all that matters, ain't it? And with that, my revisitation of PMD's first — and last — entry comes to a satisfying end; a happy end, even, considering that it virtually erased my underwhelming experience with Blue Rescue Team. And now, off to new gaming pastures!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon - Rescue Team DX: Ready to crawl", "date": "12/04/2020", "text": "After a couple of hours of farming and grinding and crawling and stockpiling, I'm finally prepared to tackle that accursed Sky Tower. Not only is my inventory full to the brim with all sorts of crawling necessities, but I prepped up my team for a long and potentially arduous crawling session. A picture is worth a thousand word, so see for yourself the extent of my preparations below:There are five pages like this. Not bad, knowing that my storage was desperately empty a couple of hours ago. And after reaching the Platinum level, I have 48 slots in my crawling bag ready for the filling. Those levels should suffice to tackle the Sky Tower without biting the dust. The Stamina Band, which considerably reduces Sakura's belly depletion speed, will allow me to crawl without having to worry about my Apple supplies; and the Heal Ribbon will protect my weaker Pika-Cute from fainting too readily.Yes, let's.And so, to the Sky Tower we go! I'll see you soon with a fresh crawling report, dear fellow gamers. Take care, and keep up with the good gaming!"},
{"title": "Atelier Sophie: 48 hours and counting", "date": "06/04/2020", "text": "48 hours of Atelier Sophie, folks! How did it come to this? If you ask my inner gaming clock, I've been playing for hardly 10 hours, not close to 50. I love that game indeed, oooh yes precious. I've come a long way since my last post, as shown by the following list of accomplishments: — I reached the lv.20 level cap and entered the Ability Point regimen. All characters benefited from it and were automatically promoted to lv. 20, even those who never put a toe on the battlefield such as Cory or Fritz. I upgraded my crew's most spammed used Skills and raised their Stats, but there's still a lot of potential for growth. — I enhanced my crew's gear to the max after grinding tons of Rainbow Crystals in the Forgotten Nursery. Thanks to all that toiling, I could finally beat not only that darn giant fish at Prospector's Strand, but also a Puny boss and a pair of dragons. — I synthesized a Fairy Cauldron with complete Rotation, a 5x5 grid and a lv.2 Bonus Display. This was a major alchemic victory for nooby little me, and it significantly increased my mastery of Synthesis. For instance, I noticed that the order in which I put pieces matters: if I want to increase a certain Trait, I should put the pieces that correspond to it last, when the Effect Values of Panels have been maxed up by the addition of other pieces.   — I uncovered the last of the Hope Recipes, although I still have to synthesize it. There are still 9 recipes missing in that Hope batch, but I'm not losing sleep over it as long as I can still progress unhindered.— I unlocked the Dream and Mystery Recipes. Not only that, but the last of the Dream Recipes is ready for the synthethizing and just waiting for my Alchemy Level to be raised. Unless I decide to ignore the level suggestions entirely, as I did a couple of times already. With all that done and dusted, the only thing left to do is to keep foraging, fighting and synthesizing till I see the credits roll — or fold under grinding fatigue. We're not there yet; so for now, back to the cauldron indeed!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon - Rescue Team DX: Smooth sailing (as expected)", "date": "30/03/2020", "text": "15 hours in; my run so far is placid and uneventful, in the nicest possible way. I mean, I knew exactly what to expect from RTDX: I knew I was going to have a blast crawling, I knew I was going to lose myself in rescue missions, and I knew I was going to love that game. The report's over; see ya soon!Nah, just joking. I resumed my demo save and went crawling with my little Sakura and Pika-Cute; and while I was fully happy with that duo during the demo, I started to have second thoughts as I entered the main game. Not only was the pair identical to the one I used in my run of Explorers of Sky, but Skitty was embarrassingly weak and delicate. However, I've made peace with that choice since — if only because Sakura grew exponentially stronger over the last hours, like any good Skitty should.I made little change to my crawling ways since the beginning. XP is not divided between team members; so I tried accepting all new recrues at first to give me a hand on the battlefield, letting them go when the mission was over. However, leading many 'Mons made battles so slow and tedious that I quickly stopped, preferring to stick with my kawaii duo instead. They currently lounge at lv. 25 and boast efficient Move pools: Thunder, Blizzard, Ice Beam and Double Slap for Sakura and Thunder, Iron Tail, Spark and Fake Out for Pika-Cute. All improvements on Thunder benefit both Sakura and Pika-Cute; I made the most of that feature and boosted Thunder like crazy. Needless to say, that Move is going nowhere and will stay in my arsenal until the end. My duo also boasts two amazing Rare Qualities: Rapid Bull's-Eyes, which makes multiple-hit Moves hit all the time, and Steamroll, which make non-effective and not very effective Moves deal substantial damage. Those Qualities, which also benefit my whole team, single-handedly turned the highly imprecise Double Slap into a tool of 'Mon destruction and virtually erase all Type dynamics — in my favour. This doesn't mean that RTDX is a cakewalk, though. I used to gorge on it and rush forward recklessly at first; alas, that ingenuous enthusiasm cooled somewhat after the utter defeat I endured in the Sky Tower two days ago. My party was wiped out, along with all my money and my hard-earned items; and I now find myself totally bereft of Apples, Ethers, Berries and other crawling necessities. I have to stockpile them again by tackling Rescue Missions, and level up my team while I'm at it; this is probably going to be a tad boring, and thus I've decided to take it slower and clear just a couple of missions every day to avoid farming burnout.And thus, by an ironic twist of fate, my planned gaming schedule now finds itself reversed: I'm playing Sophie like it's going out of fashion, and taking just small bites of RTDX. But I'm not giving up on it, dear fellow gamers; I'll see you soon with a fresh run report!"},
{"title": "Atelier Sophie: Getting to the heart of things", "date": "24/03/2020", "text": "Indeedy.Despite my claims that I would focus on Rescue Team DX, my love for Sophie clearly didn't abate, and neither did my playtime; that's how I now find myself with all Growth recipes under my belt and a good 50% of the game polished off. I reached a major narrative and alchemic milestone, and was rewarded by a lovely celebratory cutscene. This brought me a fuzzy, happy-endingy feeling of completion yet again — a feeling so satisfying that I could nearly drop the game right now. This begets the question: should I indeed quit, or should I keep playing?The \"Drop it\" arguments:— I've been playing for 25 hours already, and thus inching perilously closer to my default playing limit of 30 hours per RPG run. Granted, I still don't feel the slightest bit of gaming fatigue; yet gaming wisdom dictates that I should stop right now, while I still love the game and can come back to it later with enthusiasm and eagerness.— As far as I'm concerned (spoilers!), giving Plachta a human body was the game's main — if not ultimate — goal. I'm just done doing that; and thus, the game is kinda over in my mind, even though the credits didn't roll yet. As a matter of fact, I couldn't help but smell a whiff of postgame when I started exploring the third batch of recipes. (end of spoilers)The \"Stick with it\" arguments: — I still love the game to pieces. Not only am I never out of things to do — and never bored thanks to the variety of those things to do — but the game also regularly brings in new gameplay features — such as giving gifts to allies, merchants and artisans. It would be a pity to stop now that I have the opportunity to give Sophie a full harem, now wouldn't it? — I currently have a number of appetizing grindy goals to reach. Those include farming money thanks to that excellent tip, and using that money to enhance my current gear to the max. Then I can challenge that stupid giant fish at Prospector's Strand again, wipe the (sea)floor with it at long last, and get my revenge for the last two times when he annihilated my party. — I still get that delicious frisson when I forage gold quality items and unearth new materials. Surely this is a indisputable sign that I'm not blasé yet, isn't it? Also, the best seems to be yet to come as far as combat skills are concerned.There are valid arguments on both sides; so as usual, I'll let my faithful gaming instinct run the show. See you soon with another run report — or a half-run wrap-up post!"},
{"title": "Atelier Sophie: On to the next step", "date": "16/03/2020", "text": "After 11 hours of smooth play, I unlocked the Friendly Persona, i.e. the last of the Beginner Recipes. Doing that gave me a pleasant completion feeling, almost as if I had just finished the game; in fact, I feel so good about myself and my accomplishments in Sophie that I could nearly stop playing it right now. I won't, of course; I'm not bored of that game yet, and there's still a lot to discover and achieve.Call me Darth Maul.That being said, I will play in a more casual, relaxed way from now on. Sophie was the only thing I played these last ten days, and I didn't complain; but to avoid alchemy fatigue, and because other games are begging for my attention now, I'm going to space my Sophie sessions out. I don't worry too much about losing the thread, because story in that game is little more than an paper-thin excuse to move the player forward; and neither do I worry about not getting my fill, because even short playing bouts usually make me feel nicely sated.There's little novelty since my last post, apart from the fact that everything is getting better. Combat is snappier and more thrilling since I gained a fourth party member and extra skills with badass animations, I have enough areas unlocked to forage without ever being bored, and I manage to snatch rare materials on a regular basis thanks to a clever use of rain and Rumors. My only gripe so far is the limited size of my basket, which often forces me to exit areas just when materials start getting valuable and abundant. To avoid that, I run around, fight a bit, and only start foraging when I reach Gathering Level 3 or 4. Thanks to that carefully controlled recklessness, I managed to obtain high-quality materials with interesting Traits much earlier than in other Atelier games. High-quality materials mean more productive synthesis, more efficient crafting, a better gameplay experience overall, and a happier little me. Did someone say Castlevania?My plan for the next days is simple: to keep running around, foraging, fighting and synthesizing until I clear the whole batch of Growth Recipes. After that, we'll see if I keep going or take a small break. I'll see you soon with a fresh run report, dear fellow gamers Stop the presses! I just received my copy of PMD: Rescue Team DX, and that game takes absolute precedence over everything else. The next Sophie run report might come later than expected; still, I won't drop the game. Stay tuned!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Let's Go Eevee: A digest", "date": "11/03/2020", "text": "I was initially planning to write a list of all the things I loved in LGE; but I quickly realized that such a list would quite be massive and indigestible indeed, and that it would be much faster to list the teeny-tiny number of things I kinda disliked. To sum it up: I loved absolutely everything about LGE, apart from the things below.No Bike! I recently started to use the Bike in my runs for faster roaming; and just when I learn to appreciate that tool's virtues, GameFreak takes it away from me? That's not fair! I know that rideable 'Mons are supposed to replace the Bike in LGE, but they're not nearly as convenient. For one thing, you must have them in your active team to ride them; for another, they're all huge and kinda hard to manoeuvre.The total absence of Breeding: No compensation mechanism this time, Breeding cannot be performed in any way, shape or form in LGE. I understand the rationale behind that exclusion: Let's Go was designed as a return to form, a celebration of everything Gen I stood for; and thus it makes total sense to have things exactly as in Yellow and not offer Breeding. I do understand; but I'm sad still, because Breeding would have made that game absolutely perfect as far as I'm concerned. Not being able to Breed will dramatically reduce the number of solo runs I can tackle, making LGE a mere Eevee solo run simulator instead of the grand Gen I revisitation it could have been.Fly is too hard to find: I missed Fly entirely despite making a habit of talking to every single NPC. That's a shame, especially since LGE went above and beyond the call of duty to make HMs accessible and get rid of all the Gen I travel roadblocks. Not having Fly in my arsenal needlessly lengthened my run; so next time, I'm gonna cheat shamelessly and snatch Fly with a little help from internet wisdom. That's pretty much the full extent of my issues with LGE; needless to say, I can totally live with that. I'll wrap up that post by saying that this game is everything a remake should be. It feels new and fresh yet lovingly familiar, and it retains the best of the original while improving on it tremendously. My brother-in-law, who's a dyed-in-the-wool genwunner, is consumed by LGE right now — and getting the same kind of Game Boy vibes from it as I did, which makes me say that this game totally managed to capture the purest, brightest essence of Gen I. Gee, could it be that I kinda became a genwunner? At any rate, my love for Kanto has never been more vibrant!Oh, and a last-minute reveal before I take French leave: my sister, who dropped Platinum after five minutes of play because it was too grindy for her taste, has been playing LGE for 12 hours and counting. If that ain't a proof of LGE's quality and wholesomeness, I don't know what is. And now, on to the next Poke-adventure!"},
{"title": "Atelier Sophie: Yeah, I bought it", "date": "07/03/2020", "text": "I finally caved in and secured the whole Mysterious trilogy, despite swearing up and down that I wouldn't. But let's be honest, dear fellow gamers: you know me enough to know that I just cannot resist RPGs — and heck, I know myself enough to know that I just shouldn't make such lofty non-purchase claims.Anyway, I expected the worst from Sophie after reading a couple of scathing reviews, starting with my fellow blogger Kina's run report; but my gaming instinct was unswayed and compelled me not only to purchase that game, but also to play it right after said purchase. And heck, it was right on the mark as usual: I've been playing Sophie for a good 8 hours, and enjoying it for just as long. The things I dig:— Pint-sized harvesting areas. I have a thing for teeny-tiny dungeons since I played Hyperdimension Neptunia; so Sophie's zones, which are several notches smaller than Lydie&Suelle's, are a blessing in disguise as far as I'm concerned. Sure, there's no exploration whatsoever; but I'd gladly trade the discovery thrill for harvesting ease.— Respawning materials and foes. Oh, the joy! The absence of respawning was one of my biggest regrets in L&S, as it forced me to exit areas once I was done looting them; but this time, I can forage and fight to my heart's content, as everything respawns at the speed of light. I often find it hard to stop myself from plundering zones in an endless grinding loop, which should surprise absolutely no one.— The simpler quality values. Item quality is expressed by a letter from S to E and a word (average, worthless, etc), instead of a combination of a number from 1 to 999 and a letter from S to F like in L&S. This might seem infuriatingly simple to Atelier veterans, but it's just perfect for a noob like me. — Clearer synthesis grid. I already loved L&S' grid, but I love Sophie's even more. Everything is based on matching item colours with grid colours; squares that reduce or raise colour values, which played a huge role in L&S, are nowhere to be found in Sophie. Maybe they'll pop up later; but for now, I relish the simplicity and straightforwardness of synthesis in Sophie. The former reservations that were swept aside:  — The fighting system. The consensus seems to be that Sophie's fighting system is too slow and complex for its own good — and for an Atelier game; but after selecting the Easy mode upon starting and toggling the Skip feature to speed up battle animations, I found combat to be perfectly bearable, and even entertaining. It probably helps that I hardly ever change stances and don't bother targeting foes with a Warning once I'm strong enough to endure their attacks. — The graphics. They looked ugly on screenshots, and they look just as ugly in motion: dark subdued colours and blocky shapes, i.e. everything I hate in video games. This was clearly my biggest reservation, especially after emerging from L&S' dazzling colourful world; but fortunately, I manage to forget the graphics entirely as I play. I also find myself unexpectedly drawn to the skies, which are some of the most gorgeous I've encountered in an Atelier game. I'm especially starstruck (indeed) when gazing at the sunset and starry night skies.In brief: so far, so good! I have no trouble at all unlocking recipes, to my utter relief and delight; and since I'm focusing on recovering Plachta's memories instead of clearing side quests, I'm progressing much faster than in L&S. Stay tuned for fresh run reports, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "RemiLore: Now we're talking (and loving it)", "date": "03/03/2020", "text": "So, this is one of those games; one of those games in which the first playthrough is the hardest and the most tedious by far, and exists solely to pave the way for further and more pleasant ones. RemiLore suddenly became oodles of fun after the credits rolled for the first time, and I've been on a roll (indeed) ever since. My first run was seven hours long, and full to the brim with untimely deaths; the half-dozen runs I polished off after that, on the other hand, never lasted more than one hour and didn't see me kick the bucket once. Talk about a serious change of fortune!Of course, this is totally due to the many New Game + playing options, which allow the diligent player to toggle difficulty at will. After struggling like crazy during my first run, I wanted to have an easy ride, i.e. what I signed for in the first place; and lucky me, I finally got it thanks to the awesome Custom Load option, which lets you choose the weapon and Ultimate Spell of your choice and change them at any moment. I settled for Remi's Golden Broom, i.e. the most powerful weapon in the whole game, and the Flame spell, i.e. the best way to wipe a room clean in a matter of seconds. I conveniently switch to Bullet Onslaught for boss fights, just to be able to deal damage from a distance. I know that's cheap, but I just love it.My vision — and experience — of RemiLore radically improved after I finished it; and had I known what I know now, I would probably had played my first run differently and spared myself a lot of hassle. And because I'm really just a kind soul, I'm gonna give you my personal advice for a comfortable first run, dear fellow gamers:— Avoid what I dubbed 'Unreliable Random Rolls' like the plague. They look like floating papers, and they'll randomly grant you upgrades as readily as downgrades. You should avoid them entirely during your first run, because you cannot alleviate the bad consequences of downgrades during said first run. After I got an excellent weapon/Ultimate Spell switched to a lamer one and my MP and HP reduced a couple of times, I learnt my lesson. Painfully.— Stick to a weapon that grants improved critical rate if you can: it really makes a HUGE difference on the battlefield. Also, stick to the three main offensive Ultimate Spells, namely Flame, Bullet Onslaught and Spiral Onslaught: they'll come in handy both during regular fights and boss fights. — Your faithful book Lore shoots self-aiming bullets at regular intervals; that ability can be used to deal damage to bosses while taking the time to study their attack patterns. In fact, it can even be used to eliminate them entirely: I managed to finish off one boss that way, running and dashing around it while Lore did his thing. Perfect when your HP bar is nearly depleted.— Dashing can be a lifesaver — literally. I usually charge like a bull and don't bother parrying or dodging in ARPGs; but this time, I used the B button like my life depended on it — which was actually the case. You just won't make it through that game in one piece if you don't Dash; so better get used to it right away.  Overall, just keep in mind that your main goal during the first run is to make it alive. Fun will come afterwards! Once you get through the hassle of the first run, RemiLore becomes the perfect game for a gaming quickie, offering pint-sized yet fulfilling playthroughs. Such games are painfully rare these days, so I'll definitely cherish RemiLore — and hold onto my save data like my life depends on it!"},
{"title": "RemiLore: Diablo meets Candy Crush", "date": "25/02/2020", "text": "I didn't choose that title solely because RemiLore is a Hack and Slash in which you collect candies, but also to convey that it stands halfway between hardcore and casual. As such, it's bound to ruffle pretty much everyone's feathers at first — including mine. Here are a couple of things you may want to know about that game before you commit yourself to a purchase:— It's much harder than you'd think. RemiLore may be hardly longer and deeper than your average phone game, but that doesn't mean it's a cakewalk. Mashing the A button won't do the trick and carry you through the game; this is no mere Action-RPG, but a true blue Hack and Slash, which implies subtler fighting physics and a higher level of technicality. Mastering the flow of battle through sheer exposure is crucial to progress, as each weapon and each foe has its own fighting rhythm and style.— It's a Die and Retry thing. Not in a platformy sort of way, though: since levels are randomly generated, you won't have to learn every single enemy placement à la Ghosts' n Goblins to make it through RemiLore. Instead, it's an iterative process: you gain better weapons and abilities as you forge ahead, which allows you to progress a bit further each time, until you finally make it to the credits.— It's utterly shallow. Not only can you forget right away about any sort of RPG mechanic involving levels, skills or customization, but you must also renounce any sort of evolution in the core gameplay. Punching things into oblivion is this game's sole reason to live, and that's what you'll be doing from the title screen to the credits. The story is so utterly futile that you're given the option to play the whole thing without cutscenes, right from the first run. If you don't like that maniacal focus on all things fighting, you'd better give RemiLore a very wide berth. — It's both cruel and forgiving. RemiLore slaps you with one hand and strokes you with the other, in the blindest and most befuzzling — or infuriating — way.  You die and die and die again, with no save point whatsoever to preserve your hard-earned progress through levels; yet you get to keep your weapon, your upgrades and most of your hard-earned Candy. You sometimes get a handful of healing potions at once, or a bunch of amazing weapons; yet you cannot store any of them for future use. You get blessed with the sweetest upgrades, and cursed with the meanest downgrades the minute after.— The fighting system is awesome. Not only is there a lovely physicality to all thing punching, with neat hitboxes, automatic aiming in melee and just the right density and elasticity from foes, but you can really punch it your way thanks to all the weapons and upgrades available. Want to be all about combos? You can! Want to use magic and hardly lift a finger? You can too! Well, if you get the right upgrade, that is. Which can be tricky sometimes. But still, the possibility is there! Cherry on the cake, you can destroy furniture for extra fun and Candies. It's so darn addictive that I just cannot leave a room before every single movable smashable lies in tatters.In a nutshell: RemiLore is a cute Hack and Slash with excellent physics yet shallow gameplay. I'm not too sure there is actually a wide audience for that kind of thing — or even an audience at all, for that matter: hardcore Hack and Slash aficionados may sniff at the game's lack of depth and challenge, while casual players may be put off by its unexpected difficulty spikes. Heck, even I cannot swear I'll manage to finish it: I went in expecting a light-hearted, easy-peasy ride, and kinda got more than I bargained for. Oh well, we'll see!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Let's Go Eevee: The game I never knew I needed", "date": "18/02/2020", "text": "I'll admit it: I bought that game solely to get that lovely fluffy Gigantamax Eevee in Sword&Shield. I certainly didn't expect to enjoy it one bit — let alone to absolutely adore it. That game blew away all my negative preconceptions in the sweetest way, and I'm more than happy to eat humble pie. Also: from now on, I vow to never again take part in heated internet debates about yet unreleased games, be said debates positive or negative. Unlike Yellow, which didn't allow Pikachu to shine as a starter, LGE is the perfect vehicle for Eevee. In true Yellow fashion, that brand-new starter version of Eevee cannot evolve; but that small annoyance is more than compensated by the existence of eight amazing Partner Moves with a BP of 90 — one for each of the types Eevee can evolve into. Not only that, but Eevee's stats were boosted especially for LGE, with a base stat total of 435 instead of 325. All in all, Partner Eevee so is ridiculously overpowered that I really wonder why Let's Go Pikachu is the most popular half of the pair. Of course, I'm being purely rhetorical here, because I know why just as well as the next Pokefan; but gosh, players should really give Let's Go Eevee a try and revel in the sheer badassness of little Eevee. Cherry on the cake, Partner Eevee is absurdly adorable, with its cute little cries and lovely fur a shade lighter than regular Eevee's. Of course, I cannot help but mention 'Mon catching — i.e. the feature that revolted me before the game's release — and eat yet another giant slice of that humble pie by admitting that it's much, much funnier than I expected it to be. After fumbling in the early stages, I found my catching groove and was soon trapped in the most delicious grinding and farming trance, sending my freshest catch to Professor Oak and reaping Candies like it was going out of fashion. I swear, my little Eeveeta gobbled so much Candies that she was probably diabetic by the end of my run! I really dig the clarity of that new system, which I'd dub 'EV Training for Pokénoobs'. I routinely manage to max up my One and Onlies' EV in my runs; however, I always do so in the blindest way, just punching every creature that crosses my path into oblivion. This time around, I was able to see exactly which Mons were tied to which stats through the obtention of Candies; and I shamelessly used that knowledge to patch up Eeveeta's weaknesses during the early stages. This was a perfectly wholesome game, full of lovely details and moments — from Pokemon private jokes for the faithful to Eevee itself, which is the cutest and dinkiest thing this side of Skitty. LGE offers the best quality of life improvements while still boasting a very retro, 8-bit quality that I totally didn't expect to find. I got flashbacks of my Game Boy days all through my run, which was the most wondrous and unexpected thing ever — heck, even the GBA remakes didn't make me feel that way! I really got that sweet, vibrant feeling of discovery, which was part and parcel of my first videogaming experiences yet got fainter and fainter over the years. As far as I was concerned, Gen VIII Kanto might as well be a new region — because that's how roaming it made me feel. For the first time in years, I kinda didn't want my run to end when I was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Yup: I love that game indeed, more than I ever though I would — which begs the logical question: should I also buy Let's go Pikachu? Somehow, I don't really want to — more like really don't want to. Not only do I prefer the Let's Go Eevee version exclusives, but I don't even need a second copy for trading purposes given that breeding is absent from Let's Go. Also, I don't quite fancy Pikachu enough to want to cruise with him yet again in Kanto. Let's just stick to little Eevee, shall we? (Edit: I finally bought Let's Go Pikachu.) See you soon for more Let's Go goodness, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon - Rescue Team DX: Yes please! ", "date": "13/02/2020", "text": "I got my precious Switch Lite a mere one and a half month ago, and I've bought waaay too many games for it already. But no matter how liberal I am when it comes to gaming purchases, I still maintain a strict policy of NOT purchasing Switch ports and remakes of games I already own on other handhelds. This means that Switch titles such as Fate Extella Link, Disgaea 1 Complete or The Lost Child are, no matter how tempting they may be to yours truly, a total no-buy. However, every rule needs an exception; and in that case, the (most welcome) exception is none other than Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX, a remake of a game I first played and wrote about a good six years ago. Back in the days, I spared no words to illustrate my dislike of the original. At the time, I was mostly disturbed by the primitive graphics and the random dungeon design; however, I quickly learnt to accept the former as an essential element of the Pokemon series' DNA, and the latter as part and parcel of the Roguelike genre. After playing and loving Explorers of Sky and Gates to Infinity, I gave Blue Rescue Team another chance; unfortunately, I was totally put off by the slow and clunky gameplay, and decided to part with the game for good. As I exited the pawn shop, I was utterly convinced I would never, ever play that game again; and I couldn't help but feel a mite sad over not liking the original instalment of one of my favourite Roguelite series out there. But lo and behold, Rescue Team DX is coming; and it's giving me the delicious and most unexpected opportunity to get over my hard feelings towards Blue Rescue Team. That remake literally solves all my issues with the original game: it offers prettier graphics (the coloured pencil effect is the most adorably regressive eye-candy I've seen this side of Yoshi's Island) and dungeons that look more naturalistic, along with much snappier and smoother gameplay. Not only that, but it even solves issues I didn't have, such as not being able to choose my main 'Mon! Of course, I chose Skitty as said main 'Mon, with Pikachu as my comrade-in-arms. The demo was short and sweet, and delightful all around: the remake nicely — and wisely — retains the swiftness of the original, with only the minimal amount of cutscenes and lightning fast immersion into all things roaming & crawling. I harbour very warm feelings towards Rescue Team DX already, and I'm preciously keeping my save data safe until it get to play the real thing.All in all, I can't help but marvel at the twists and turns of gaming fate: never in a million years did I think I could finally play and enjoy that game, so many years after playing it and ranting writing about it for the first time! I'm hyped up for Rescue Team DX and waiting impatiently for the 6th of march; and I'm seriously hoping that this unexpected remake will pave the way for more PMD entries on the Switch. Lovely Pokemon and crawling days ahead!"},

I'm pretty patient and tolerant; but even I can't help being annoyed when the Switch connection to Facebook is down for more than a full week, preventing me from exporting pictures of my latest runs and putting the finishing touches to my posts about said latest runs. This system was already tedious enough, but that was the last straw. I thus caved in and purchased an SD card, along with a PC adapter. No more transfer hassle, hooray! Until these preciouses arrive, I'm gonna shelve my already written posts. I'll hopefully see you soon, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Atelier Lydie & Suelle: Still going strong...", "date": "30/01/2020", "text": "But for how long? As my run is clocking at 14 hours, I'm starting to feel the teeny-tiniest bit of grinding fatigue. This would be fine if L&S was heading towards its conclusion; but if my current Alchemy Rank (F, for the record) and the number of still unknown recipes are any indication, I've hardly cleared one quarter of the game. I'm not quite sure I can clock up 45 more hours just right now.Of course, that sorry state of affairs is entirely my fault. I was the one who spent an uncanny amount of time clearing fetch quest after fetch quest instead of focusing on raising my Alchemy Rank; the game didn't force me to cruise the same two areas, forage the same materials and kill the same enemies for hours on end. You could say I dug my own grave there; and now that we're getting to the important stuff, I'm kinda out of gaming juice!Or maybe it's just that I'm not in the mood for an alchemic RPG right now. Atelier games typically require a lot of planning and ressource management; and with my gaming time being in short supply these days, I cannot indulge in deep and productive alchemy bouts. Even though I love L&S to pieces, I always have this nagging feeling that I didn't accomplish enough at the end of a playing session; yet at the same time, that game is not simple and repetitive enough to put me in a sweet grinding trance — especially now that the number of objectives and recipes is increasing and the complexity of synthesis is being raised.Yup, I have a total crush on Lydie ♥ So, I'm going to take a break and play something else during the next days; and we'll see if my thirst for all things Atelier is rekindled by that pause. At any rate, I already answered most of the questions I pondered in my last post. I'm not gonna purchase Atelier Sophie because the graphics look too dull and ugly, and I'm not gonna purchase Atelier Firis because it boasts an open world — and you know how much I hate those. Nelke is also a no-go because of its increased focus on management and lack of roaming freedom; which means that the only entry still on the fence is Atelier Lulua. On one hand, I love the graphics and Lulua's looks; on the other hand, I'm not thrilled by the link with the Arland subseries. Feel free to give me enlightened advice on all those games, dear fellow gamers; and see you soon with fresh gaming tidings!"},
{"title": "Atelier Lydie & Suelle: My time has come", "date": "24/01/2020", "text": "My time to enjoy Atelier games, that is.Just like famous bands, long-running video game series evolve and go through phases, losing and earning fans along the way. The Atelier series has been through two such phases lately: first the Dusk subseries, which seems to be considered by Atelier veterans as the beginning of the end for the venerable series; and then the Mysterious subseries, which those same veterans seem to brand as a complete travesty of what Atelier games are supposed to stand for. Being the farther thing from an Atelier veteran myself, I'll wisely abstain from any judgement on the series' evolution; all I can say is that I kinda disliked the Arland games, loved Ayesha, and absolutely adore Lydie & Suelle. L & S totally fits my early dreams of what an alchemic RPG should be like: tons and tons of foraging, no time limit whatsoever, adorkable characters and lovely little areas choke-full of materials. And those bright, vivid colours! Oh, what a pure eye-candy! I thought the land of Dusk in Ayesha was gorgeous, but it pales — in every sense of the word — when compared to the twin's dazzling homeland. As for alchemy, it has never been simpler, easy to figure out and intuitive to a noob like me. I so love the grid system, which makes things deliciously obvious and clear! Ayesha's Trait system always remained a bit of a mystery to me, even after two full playthroughs; on the other hand, I already have a good grip on the L&S grid after a mere 5 hours of play. Hooray!For all intents and purposes, L&S is actually a regular RPG with some alchemy spread on top, whereas older Atelier games tended to be time management games sprinkled with RPG features. Alchemy is nearly treated as an afterthough in L&S: not only is the number of recipes really tiny, but they must be unlocked by doing things you naturally do in RPGs — such as fighting, crawling, foraging and the like. So far, my own run has been 90% crawling, foraging and questing and 10% alchemy; an unbalance that can be blamed partly on L&S' diminished focus on alchemy and massively on my uncanny passion for all things grinding and crawling. My only beefs with the game so far are minor ones that only serves to highlight how much I love doing what I do in L&S: there's just not enough room in the basket, and enemies don't respawn! Heck, I'd spend even impossibly more time roaming zones if that were the case.Long story short, I love L&S like no other Atelier game before it, which totally puts me in the cohort of new fans that were brought into the fold by the Mysterious subseries — and, to a lesser extent, by the Dusk subseries. This raises interesting questions such as \"Should I purchase the rest of the Mysterious entries despite the fact that they are digital-only games, which I hate?\" and \"Should I blindly purchase all Atelier games from now on, or remain vigilant and check them individually to make sure they fit me?\" I'll ponder the answers in due time; for now, back to da grind!"},

I promised to deliver my impressions on the new Pokemon pair soon, along with a run report; however, I don't feel like writing about Sword&Shield just yet. A lack of writing material is not to blame, given that I polished off my first Sword run a good week ago; but for some reason, I have trouble wrapping my head around those new games and my experience of it. I most definitely need a couple of extra runs to get a good grip on Sword&Shield, both gameplay-wise and feeling-wise; and since I'm not quite in a Poké-mood right now, I'm going to shelve my Galar impressions and first run report until further notice. But rest assured that my early feelings towards Gen 8 are unabashedly positive, dear fellow gamers; so positive, in fact, that I already have a number of solo runs lined up and just ordered the Official Sword&Shield Strategy Guide.

{"title": "Switch Lite: My precious!", "date": "16/01/2020", "text": "Let's get straight to the point: I hated the regular Switch, but I love the Switch Lite. Love, love, love it!And why wouldn't I love it, when it solves nearly every single issue I had with its big sister? The Lite is mercifully lighter than the Regular, boasts longer battery life and better materials that don't gather finger grease and specks of dust, and doesn't heat up during playing sessions. It also sports a most welcome D-Pad and a screen whose size just hits the sweet spot: large enough to offer great immersion and be easy on the eyes, yet small enough to give that intimate, cosy, snuggly feeling I love to get from my handhelds.And since I mention this... The Switch Lite also nicely takes care of my biggest beef with the Regular, namely that said Regular didn't feel like a portable console. The Lite, on the other hand, is a portable through and through. Not only is it hardly bigger than a Vita, but it boasts the compactness and solidity that are part and parcel of being a handheld. Goodbye drifting and connectivity issues, hello perennity and Switch collecting!Because indeed, I'm very much going to collect for the Switch Lite. You didn't expect less from me, did you? ^__^ I know I somewhat sniffed at the Switch library two years ago; but that was then, and now my collecting instinct are waking up and dying for some new purchases — not to mention that the Switch library has become much meatier and more interesting in the meantime.In a nutshell: if you're a handheld aficionado, I totally encourage you to get your paws on the Switch Lite. It's not just a smaller version of the Switch: it's an entirely different console, period. I wouldn't touch a Regular again even if you paid me; but I'll happily secure a couple of extra Lites, thank you very much. Now I'm curious to see if the Regular will remain the preferred option, or if the Lite will simply take over and become the new portable à la mode. Can TV connectivity, motion controls and bigger dimensions fight off what is virtually a perfect handheld? Let's wait and see!"},
{"title": "Happy New Year! (Still alive and gaming!) ", "date": "09/01/2020", "text": "Hello, dear fellow gamers! Hope you had lovely holidays, full of sweet moments with your loved ones and delicious Christmas food. I had all of that myself, along with the most exquisite Christmas gift ever from my beloved sister: a brand-new Switch Lite, complete with Pokemon Sword&Shield and a matching case for good measure! I had to do justice to that perfect choice of her, obviously; and that's how I found myself tackling a Pokemon Sword run a couple of days ago. More on that later! For now, here are my gaming plans for 2020. As you now, I was crazy busy these last months, which led to my longest blogging hiatus ever; and I'll keep being busy during the next months. Fortunately, I managed to arrange my frantic routine and free a little daily time for gaming and blogging. Hooray! Regarding the latter, I'll probably craft shorter and swifter posts this year, which may actually be a blessing in disguise given how ridiculously verbose I usually am. ^__^As for gaming itself, the plan is simple: follow my trustworthy gaming instinct wherever it may lead me! I'm done with lofty resolutions such as 'clear all my Vita digital games', which I took last year and didn't even come close to fulfilling. I can also feel my collecting impulses stirring, which will sooner or later lead to a delicious shopping spree. For now, my Switch collection comprises six games: the four you can see on the picture below, plus Octopath Traveler and Labyrinth of Refrain, which I bought with my first Switch and was inspired enough not to sell along said Switch. (More like the buyer wasn't interested in snatching them, but nobody needs to know that :P)Anyway, you can expect a quick rundown of my Switch Lite impressions quite soon, along with posts about Pokemon's home console debut (or not so much in my case; but I digress here). Stay tuned, and happy gaming year!"},

{"title": "Pokemon Crystal: The Venomoth Solo Run", "date": "07/11/2019", "text": "There she is, dear fellow gamers: the shining star of my Crystal run, the 'Mon I never though I'd ever run solo with. To say that Venonat and Venomoth are rare is a gigantic understatement: half of the cannon entries don't host them at all, and the other half makes you jump through ridiculous hoops to even catch a glimpse of them. The only region where they can be found with relative easiness is Kanto; but alas, they appear so late there that a solo run featuring them was simply out of the question. Or was it? We already know the answer, of course; yet that was not the case when I started playing Crystal. My first foray into the game featured Rattata, in what I envisioned as a giant, epic 'Crappy Route 1 'Mon' solo run.  Alas, the thrill was missing: despite my Rattata's honourable battle prowess, I was kinda bored and plodded through Johto. As I had just set foot in Ilex Forest for a bout of grinding one quiet evening, the battle animation triggered; and time — and my heart — stopped when a Venonat appeared on the screen. I couldn't believe my eyes: what was that elusive creature doing here? I ran to Bulbapedia and confirmed the unthinkable: in Crystal, and only in Crystal, Venonat had a 30% chance of appearing at night in Ilex Forest.That was the most unexpected and delicious gift from the RPG gods ever, and it led to an instant ditching of my Rattata run. I started a new game, rushed to Ilex Forest, and recruited an adorable Venonat I fittingly named Murasaki. My heart bursting with the giddy happiness of the Trainer that managed to catch the 'Mon of their dreams, I started leveling up my cute little bug for the trials to come. Not the easiest of tasks, that: my Venonat was a weak debutant, and I had to backtrack to Route 32 to even have a chance to survive battles. The many Bellsprouts roaming the area made my grinding smoother and faster, along with the conveniently placed Pokemon centre; and once Murasaki hit lv.12, I went and raided Slowpoke Well. Cleaning the place of the Rockets was a challenge that required several tries, but I finally triumphed. Once that hurdle was overcome, I knew that my Venonat's epic solo epopee had started for good, and that I'd pretty much be on a roll from then on. Or nearly so — but more on that later.  When it came to Move pools, I didn't entirely leave things to chance as usual. The Veno line boasts an excellent leveling-up learnset, with the powerful Psychic triad Confusion, Psybeam and Psychic and the self-healing Bug move Leech Life — all Moves I learnt and made the most of. However, I wanted more: my beloved Return to replace the crappy Tackle, and Sludge Bomb to take advantage of the STAB and indulge (at last) in wielding a kickass Poison Move. A quick search on Bulbapedia revealed me the location of those TMs (which I'd totally never have found myself), and they quickly turned my already powerful Venomoth into a weapon of 'Mon destruction. The final touch came with the obtention of Giga Drain in Celadon City, which came to replace Leech Life right on time for Kanto's late stages. Made you my b*tch too, just like your pal Blue ♪So, how did little Murasaki fare through two Regions, 16 Gyms, one Elite Four and two Champions? Pretty well indeed, if I say so myself. She had the trajectory of a typical Bug 'Mon, i.e. starting painfully weak and slowly but surely growing into a powerhouse. Even after my initial grinding bout, I kept struggling for a while: the Azalea Gym was a pain because Bugsy's Scyther was stupidly sturdy and resistant to my best attacks, and I had to postpone Goldenrod City's fight against Whitney as much as I could because her Milktank was just too infuriatingly strong. It was pretty much smooth sailing after that, with only the random strong Fire 'Mon to worry about — nothing that Murasaki's stellar stats and Battle Items couldn't take care of. One-shooting soon became our bread and butter, making that run pure delight all the way through. I know of someone else who should be delighted about that run; and that's faithful reader Kumiko, who's a great fan of the Veno line. Here's to you, my fellow Bug 'Mon lover: the Venomoth run both of us never though would happen! And to all of you fellow Pokefans who appreciate the subtle charms of Bug 'Mons: rest assured that this is not my last run featuring one of those lovely creatures indeed. Take care — until next time!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Crystal: A discovery", "date": "01/11/2019", "text": "I've known and loved the Pokemon series for five long, delicious years. In those five years, I racked up tons of exciting runs and managed to play pretty much all entries from all Gens. Or nearly all of them: because indeed, the original Gen II games have managed to elude me until now. Not that this was a surprising or major feat by any means, mind you: with functioning Gen II cartridges being so darn rare and expensive these days, it was much cushier to renounce the Gold/Silver/Crystal trilogy and make do with the DS remakes. Still, I couldn't help but feel wistful at the thought that the original Gen II experience might be forever out of my reach... That is, until I stumbled upon a 15-euro digital copy of Pokemon Crystal in a game store. There it was: the opportunity to discover Gen II in all its authentic glory, brought to me on a silver platter. Sure, it was a digital game; but it was also very likely my one and only chance to get acquainted with Gen II without enduring battery hassle and insane pricing. And thus I caved in, and bought the thing.However, once Crystal was securely nested on my 2DS' SD card, I found myself weirdly reluctant to play it. The main reason was simple: every time a potential run popped up in my head, I immediately started thinking that it would be better to perform it in HeartGold or SoulSilver and get the unbearably cute benefit of having my One and 'Monly following me around. That was a perfectly sound reasoning, but not exactly conducive to playing Crystal. Once I finally managed to start the deed, I quickly realized that my natural curiosity regarding videogame history wouldn't be enough to carry me through Crystal, and that my only hope of enjoying (and finishing) that game would be to uncover a 'Mon exclusive to it. Or, more precisely, a early Johto 'Mon that appeared solely in Crystal — that is, if there even was such a 'Mon in the first place. Turned out that there was one indeed — and what a 'Mon that was! The lucky winner was a rare creature I had renounced already, which doubled my joy of unearthing it. But I'm getting ahead of myself: before I recount that marvelous mystery run, I'm gonna indulge in a potpourri of my impressions of Crystal. Still ugly as heck: It boggles my mind that Crystal offers no visible graphical improvement over Gen I beyond the titular colours of its hosting machine. Without even taking into account the release date, which should have guaranteed top-notch graphics by sheer virtue of being so late into the GB line's life cycle, the consistency of the graphics' shittiness is shocking and puzzling. If we set aside Red and Blue, which looked hideous because of their chaotic development cycle combined with a crippling lack of resources, it seems indeed that the series' long-running history of subpar graphical prowess started with Gold and Silver. I'd really like to know the reasons beyond GameFreak's apparent refusal to step up their graphical game with Gen II. Was the development team still uncomfortably tiny despite all the revenue generated by the Pokemon craze? Did the thrifty and canny habits contracted during Gen I's development cycle somehow carry over to Gen II's? Or was it sheer complacency, with GameFreak realizing that graphical crappiness didn't hamper the series' success one bit and simply deciding to take it easy from then on? Could it even have been a mix of all three, combined with other reasons I didn't think of? I'll sure have to do a bit of digging to solve that mystery now that my curiosity is roused.   The loose cannons: There is even less of a story in Crystal than in Red and Blue — and that's really saying something, given that those two barely had a story beyond chasing your rival and thwarting Team Rocket's evil plans while doubling as Professor Oak's little lackey. The red thread is even more tenuous this time around, starting with Professor Elm and his dubious friend Mr. Pokemon using me as a mere errand boy instead of entrusting me right away with that most important task of filling up the Pokedex. Now if you're gonna enslave me, at least give me noble tasks to achieve, dang it! Then there's Team Rocket, or rather its remnants: because indeed, we're merely dealing with a bunch of former Rocket executives on the run, trying to make do in Johto with petty criminal schemes. No big boss, no big evil plan anymore: just dejected, disorganized hoodlums that I encounter because we happen to cruise the same region. Last but not least, you have Silver, i.e. The Series' Most Random Rival Ever. There is just no. tie. whatsoever. between my Trainer and Silver. I literally don't know him before I catch him spying on Professor Elm; then we bump into each other outside Violet City, and that's pretty much the full extent of our acquaintance. Heck, I know the guy's name only because I randomly picked up his ID from the ground! We're not even really true blue rivals, when you think of it; more like Trainers with conflicting philosophies that run into each other on a regular basis. Long story short: no other Pokemon entry makes me feel so strongly that I'm a free agent, let loose in a world where everybody is too busy to bother with me. And I must admit it's kinda refreshing. 'Here we go, you Johto punk!' Excuse my French. Lost in translation? Since I'm mentioning Silver, let me tell you about an interesting phenomenon that may or may not be exclusive to the french version of Crystal. That's the version I played, and it features the original translation from 2001; and lo and behold, that translation makes Silver significantly softer. While he's a rude and arrogant prick in HeartGold and SoulSilver, he's a much nicer chap in french Crystal: he still has an edge to him, sure, but he doesn't treat your Trainer like the scum of the earth. In fact, he goes as far as to call you \"my little munchkin\" and \"my pussycat\" at some point; and while there's a decidedly mocking ring to those terms, they're still much kinder than all the nasty crap he throws your way in HG/SS. And since I'm mentioning nasty crap, I had the hilarious (dis)pleasure of crossing paths — and swords — again with Blue, who was still very much the overly cocky, foul-mouthed brat I remembered from Gen I. Once a prick, always a prick indeed! Well; that's about it for Gen II, as seen through the innocent yet experienced eye of a Pokefan that came long after the hype. It was entertaining and eye-opening, and it sure made me want to explore the early stages of the franchise as a game historian. The gamer in me, on the other hand, most definitely prefers the Gen IV remakes; and unless I unearth another 'Mon exclusive to Crystal, I'll most certainly favour HeartGold and SoulSilver for future Gen II runs. And talking about 'Mons exclusive to Crystal, I'll see you soon with my run report, dear fellow gamers. Take care!"},
{"title": "Random gaming thoughts", "date": "12/10/2019", "text": "Jeez, has it already been twelve days since my last post? Oh, how time flies. I'm both super-duper busy and really tired these days, a combination that's hardly conducive to long and productive gaming sessions. At times like these, I would normally take it easy and fall back on Visual Novels; but alas, I have none to play these days. I'm so desperate for a VN that I tried playing Hakuoki: Demon of the Fleeting Blossom on the PSP, despite the fact that my first brush with the series on the Vita ended up with an aborted playthrough after mere minutes of play. There was no miracle this time around either: I gave up after an excruciating hour of plodding through what was probably the most boring dialogue I've ever endured in an otome. I kid you not: that game totally sucked my life energy. Then I tried Muv-Luv, despite knowing a good portion of the plot; but the ugly character design and dumb immature dialogue were too much to bear, and I gave up. I'll try it later, I promise; but right now, this is definitely not what I need. Replaying old VNs is out of the question, because I remember all of them way too well; and I simply don't have enough mental energy to dive into Point and Clicks à la Danganronpa or 999. So here I am, stuck in virtual (non)gaming limbo, in a period where I'm making drastic changes to my life. What better time, then, to take stock of my gaming accomplishments and ponder what direction I want to sail towards in the next years? None, indeed! Gaming per se will undoubtedly follow me wherever I go, so there's nothing to ponder there; collecting, on the other hand... Now that's a whole other can of worms. Let's face it: I've grown increasingly bored of collecting in the past two years. My Collector's Delight and Coveted Games posts have gotten scarcer and scarcer until disappearing entirely, along with my purchases of collector treats such as Special Editions. Collecting, which used to be an immense source of joy, has slowly but surely turned into a chore of sorts. My current dissatisfaction with all things collecting stems from two main reasons:Being a game collector just takes up way too much space — like, physical space. I hate cluttering and item overabundance; and thus the mammoth number of games currently lounging on my shelves makes me feel seriously restless. So much useless plastic, so much room taken! Most importantly, I've gotten over the fetishist side of collecting — the whole 'sniffing booklets and gazing at box art' shebang. I used to be the most hardcore game manual aficionado, prizing those booklets like they were holy scriptures; nowadays, not only are there no more gaming manuals to cherish in brand-new physical games, but I know RPG mechanics so darn well that I don't even need manuals. In fact, the last times I tried to read the booklet before playing a game, I grew bored and dropped it after two pages. As for box art, it's always the same anime-ish crap anyway — so much so that my sister, who doesn't play RPGs at all, can identify the games I covet in a display rack solely by looking at boxes. Totally true story. In a nutshell: I've become blasé about the useless fluff that surrounds game cartridges. I was always in for the gameplay, for the games themselves; and I bought them physical first and foremost for the sake of perennity. Whatever pleasure I derived from satellite elements such as booklets and box art is long gone, and there's no telling if it will ever come back. And thus I've taken a momentous decision: I'm going to throw away all boxes and booklets, and hold solely onto cartridges and UMDs.Rest assured, dear fellow gamers, that this is by no means a rash and sudden decision. In fact, I've been pondering that move for months now. I want to simplify things, to go back to the sheer pleasure of the gameplay experience, without any interference. And I already have a preview of what a cartridge-only collection might feel like, which is none other than my GBA/Game Boy library. That library is solely composed of bare cartridges without the slightest trace of a booklet or an original box; and yet, I love and enjoy those games no less than my boxed ones. I'm ready for that major step, and I'm gonna take it, one game at a time.Then, there's the matter of the Switch Lite and Pokemon Sword&Shield. I'm getting seriously hyped up about those games — there, I said it. A limited Pokedex was never an issue for the serial Pokemon solo runner I am, and I totally dig the idea of a Pokemon region inspired by England. And then you have Galar Ponyta, who's tugging at my heartstrings like crazy. See, I'm kind of a closeted Brony: I owned a couple of Little Ponies as a kid and have the fondest memories of crafting all sorts of adventurous stories around them. And Galar Ponyta looks insanely like a '90s Little Pony, which triggers all sorts of nostalgia attacks in me. I want to run solo with him! I have to! And since I'm mentioning Pokemon solo runs, I'm currently wrapping up one of these — because when you're low on gaming juice and want to play something low-maintenance, Pokemon is the next best thing to a VN indeed. I'll see you soon for the inevitable run report, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Persona Q2 - New Cinema Labyrinth: Final thoughts", "date": "01/10/2019", "text": "This time, I'm done for good! And with hindsight, I might as well have abstained from going all the way to the final boss. Sure, crawling the last labyrinth was oddles of fun, especially after I snatched those SP and HP replenishing skills I mentioned in my last post; however, the final showdown was a major pain in the arse that left me with a sour taste in the mouth. Being forced to polish off a preliminary boss rush before I could even engage the final boss was already galling enough; but that was nothing compared to the final boss itself, which was such a massive overpowered HP bag it was not even funny. With the Safety setting firmly in place, that ultimate fight was a mere battle of attrition as far as I was concerned; but being able to rise from the dead after my whole party was slaughtered — which happened twice during the fight — didn't make the whole thing less unpleasant. That fight was a bore and a chore, with battle animations lasting forever and no strategic challenge apart from trying to wrap up the fight in less than one hour. Not that I would have wanted to change the difficulty setting to make things more challenging, mind you: that boss is so utterly OP that I cannot even begin to fathom how to beat it on regular difficulty — nor do I ever want to try. But let's see the positive side of things: I now have a Clear Game save that will grant me New Game + benefits if I play PQ2 again! And before I part with that game, let's go for a good ol' Pros&Cons list, shall we?The Good:The fighting system — or, to be more precise, the Boost and All-out Attack features. So deliciously OP, so ridiculously satisfying! Being able to wrap up fights in a single turn with a glorious animation as the finishing touch is just the stuff dazzling RPG combat dreams are made of. Fun fact: it took me several hours of play to notice that All-out Attacks were linked to Boost — but you can bet your arse that once I noticed it, I indulged in triggering All-outs like it was going out of fashion. Heck, I didn't even bother fighting and simply ran away when All-outing was not possible — that's how hooked on the whole thing I was. The Persona 5 cast: I though I could not love them more, but that was before learning that Joker's design was inspired by a black panther. Seriously? Now you're really tugging at my heartstrings, Atlus. Long story short: I adore that crew, I want to handle them again, and I already made arrangements to borrow my brother-in-law's PS3 to play the original Persona 5. Oh, and I'm sure as heck buying the upcoming Persona 5 remake-slash-reinterpretation for my future Switch.The Bad:Labyrinths were frigging hideous. They didn't even have the barren charm of old-fashioned budget FPDCs à la The Lost Child; you could feel that the developers put some effort into trying to make them look good yet failed entirely. The fourth labyrinth was a particularly low point, with its garish colours and ugly contraptions — I swear I nearly gave up to spare my poor retinas. Seriously, the labyrinths from the first Etrian Odyssey were prettier, lusher and more evocative, and that was twelve years and one console generation ago. Granted, the fifth labyrinth was much more palatable; but alas, it was pretty much a case of 'too little, too late' at that point. Too much Persona megaverse-ish fan service. I know that's the entire point of the Persona Q series, but still... The whole thing could have been handled better, methinks. There were too many cutscenes that existed for the sole purpose of making cast members from different entries bond or butt heads, and the game tried way too hard to draw parallels between said cast members. The last thing I need to have planted in my head before I dive in the canon Persona series is the notion that each entry shamelessly recycles the same character tropes, thank you very much. The Ugly:The fifth labyrinth and final showdown are entirely pointless. Not only do they feel like some sort of bastardized postgame butting in before its time, but they also somewhat undermine the impact of the preceding epopee. (Spoilers!) Helping Hikari overcome her psychological hurdles was deeply satisfying, and Doe would have been a perfect final boss to wrap up the game. Having to beat HP bag Nagi to rescue a whole posse of faceless lost souls I didn't even get to interact with was complete overkill: there was no more mystery to uncover, and no attachment whatsoever to these people I was supposedly fighting for. (End of spoilers) If I ever replay PQ2, I'll definitely stop at the end of the fourth labyrinth like I initially planned.  All in all, it was a darn good game. It made me want to play both the canon Persona series and some genuine FPDC — the kind that leaves you alone with (and in) the dungeons, with no interruption, handholding or cutscenes whatsoever. Should I play one of the two right now? My gaming instinct will run the show, as always!"},
{"title": "Person Q2 - New Cinema Labyrinth: My work here is done...", "date": "28/09/2019", "text": "... Or is it? After wrapping up the fourth labyrinth, I was ready to bid PQ2 goodbye: not only was my run clocking at a respectable 46 hours at that point, but I got a lovely conclusion involving (spoilers) Hikari overcoming her inner demons and gaining the necessary strength to pursue a happy life. This outcome was so satisfying that the idea of cruising yet another labyrinth to rescue poor souls stuck in the same predicament as Hikari-chan felt perfunctory. I got my happy ending, now I'm outta here! (End of spoilers)Music to my ears.... Or so I though. But after taking a couple of steps in the final labyrinth, I... I want to keep playing! Not only is that final labyrinth the most gorgeous of the bunch by far, but I'm really just starting to master the whole Persona business for good and all. I want to fine-tune that mastery just a tad more before my first foray into the canon Persona series — and have fun doing so while I'm at it. Having said that, I still feel like I mostly had my fill of PQ2 — pun totally intended — and thus I'm gonna drop all the sidequesty fluff and focus on exploring that final labyrinth and refining my Persona mastery. Here's what I want to achieve during that last stretch:Let my Fab Five learn Vorpal Blade and Invigorate 2 through Sacrifice Fusion. The former is the perfect boss killer; as for the latter, it will allow me to cruise longer in labyrinths without having to worry about my SP. (Then I'll have to worry about my inventory being full, but that's another matter.)Let my dungeon navi learn Paths of Light and Roads of Light, and my battle navi learn Victory Cry — for even more insane HP and SP replenishment. And... That's all, I guess! Apart from maintaining my full elemental coverage all the way through, that is. I gave up on my plan to grow specialized Sub-Personas dealing with a single elemental field; not only is it way too tedious to achieve, but it can be downright counter-productive in battle when triggering Boost requires two elements handled by the same character. Things are working just fine with my Sub-Personas handling mixed elemental skills; and so I'll keep cruising that way until the credits roll. And talking about this: back to da grind — again!"},
{"title": "Persona Q2 - New Cinema Labyrinth: Late stages", "date": "22/09/2019", "text": "33 hours in, fourth labyrinth. I'm just done slaughtering the most obnoxious boss EVER, namely the despicable Mother Computer. Not only was the fight properly interminable, but the game had the nerve to force me to use some very specific elemental attacks lest the whole thing became totally unwinnable. How dare you, Atlus! This is nothing but a big fat case of fake difficulty, and it royally pisses me off — even though I did have the necessary skills to progress. Still, I swear I would totally have ragequit — and ditched PQ2 entirely for good measure — if not for the Safety setting, which allowed my whole party to rise from the ashes after biting the dust and continue the fight as though nothing had happened. Seriously, PQ2's difficulty is sometimes so extreme it's not even funny. I can only hope that this is the Etrian Odyssey side speaking and not the Persona one, because I really don't want to struggle that much when I finally decide to tackle the series.Awesome characters talking about awesome subjects = Match made in heaven. Anyway, I still love PQ2 just as much as ten days ago. I could do with slightly less cutscenes and characters, granted; however, I have to admit that the whole Persona lore and the crew from older entries are growing on me, and my desire to play said older entries is getting stronger by the cutscene. As for my original crew, well... I have to find a way to experience Persona 5 even if it's the last thing I do! Anime, manga, future port, borrowing somebody's PS3 — anything, as long as I get to see them evolve in their original setting. I don't know why, but I just love them to pieces! It's been a long time since a video game cast delighted me that much: not only do I dig their looks to death, but their personalities and demeanour really resonate with me. Were I twenty years younger, I would have drawn comics and fanarts featuring them — heck, I'm an mere inch from doing that anyway. I kid you not: my current wallpaper is a Persona 5 art — that's how hooked on that whole Persona 5 thing I am right now.And talking about, well, Persona, I'm refining my mastery of all things Personas. I now have a clear view of what I want to achieve when it comes to Sub-Personas: since my crew's main Personas naturally wield and learn Curse, Electric, Bless, Fire and Ice abilities, I'll focus on developing Wind, Almighty, Psy, Nuke and Physical abilities for my Sub-Personas. As a matter of fact, I've already done so, but in a completely slightly haphazard and disorganized manner, which resulted in many of my Personas wielding the exact same skills. I want to streamline and simplify that whole business, and have each secondary Persona specialize in a given ability; then I can cherry-pick my favourite Healing and Buffing skills, and add them to the mix for good measure. I'm not too sure I can achieve that goal before the end of my run, because a) I'm starting so very late and b) I still have a lot to learn regarding Persona growth and fusion; but even if I don't, that will most certainly be the blueprint for my future Persona playthroughs.I'd like the fourth labyrinth to be the last, but let's face it: there will probably be a fifth labyrinth acting as the final dungeon. And as much as I love PQ2, I'm actually not quite sure I'll have the energy to finish it in one smooth go: as far as my play meter is concerned, that game should end around the 40-45 hour-mark, lest we tread on 'Too much of a good thing' territory. Maybe I should wisely take a small break from PQ2, or play another game in parallel as a breather? Oh well, we'll see. Back to da grind for now!"},
{"title": "Persona Q2 - New Cinema Labyrinth: It's a true love story", "date": "12/09/2019", "text": "I love that game! I love it! I always say I don't give a crap about characters' personalities in my RPG, but PQ2 might be the exception that proves the rule. I adore my crew, and I'd like nothing more than to see them strive, grow and prosper in the game they hail from. Given that Persona 5 is still a PS4 exclusive and that the planned Switch port is shaping up to be a totally different game (which I'll probably buy anyway, let's face it), that probably won't happen any time soon. To compensate for that sorry state of affairs, I decided to stick dutifully with the Persona 5 crew when characters from older Persona entries started raining on me; I own all of said older Persona entries and I'll play them in due time, so I'd rather enjoy the Phantom Thieves when I get to. And since PQ2 won't let me run solo, I'll perform the next best thing to a solo run, i.e. an Initial Party Run: I'll stick with my original five fab through thick and thin, until the credits roll. I would gladly have played with the lovely Noire; but alas, she came too late into the mix, and with a giant five level-deficit to boot. Sure, I could use my Growth Incense on her for instant leveling-up and party integration; but let's face it, I'm just too used to my crew's dynamics to change anything now. And now that I unlocked Unison Skills, I have even less reason to ever want to switch party members. Sorry, not sorry!Let's now talk about the famed Persona system, shall we? I love it! To pieces! It's so much fun, and so darn addictive! It took me quite a lot of time and experimentation to even get the gist of it; but I have a good grip on it now, and I'm succeeding more and more in crafting Personas that fit my fighting style. Since I'm playing on Safety Mode, and since I'm a brute that loves nothing more than to nuke everything on the battlefield, I'm favouring multi-hitting elemental attacks and strong physical attacks with a Boost bonus attached. And since I'm mentioning Boost... Oh, the glee! I know nothing more exhilarating than to surgically target all foes' weaknesses and wrap up the fight with a lovingly devastating All-Out Attack — and extra XP for the road. This is one of the most positive feedback loops I've ever encountered in an RPG fighting system, and it sure as heck encourages me to choose my skills wisely. I'm smelling a whiff of yaoi fan service here.You might notice that I'm only raving about the Persona side of things, dear fellow gamers, and rightfully ask \"But what about da dungeon crawling?\" Well, about that... The more I play PQ2, the more I'm convinced that it didn't need to be a crossover at all. The Etrian Odyssey side is so underrepresented and brings so little to the mix that it might as well not be there at all; the game could perfectly have taken place in regular dungeons and nothing of value would have been lost. In fact, I'll go further and say that the Persona side saps the EO side and makes it kinda pointless. EO's two main assets, namely its immense crawling freedom and its autarkic crafting system, don't get to shine at all in PQ2. The former is destroyed by the constant cutscenes, tutorials and narrative railing; and the latter is made redundant by the Boost system, which emphasizes elemental matching in battle rather than mere gear stats. I daresay that we're nearly dealing with a case of 'too much of a good thing' here: there's a mite too much to do and think of — draw maps, avoid FOEs, watch cutscenes, sell loot, find and manage Personas — and it can be overwhelming at times. Less is more indeed, especially as far as my RPG tastes are concerned. Anyway, do you know what all that means, dear fellow gamers? It means that I'm gonna have a big fat blast when I finally decide to play a true blue Persona game! In fact, I'd do just that right now, if not for the fear of overkill. Let's clear PQ2 first, shall we? And since I'm mentioning this, I have a couple of Personas waiting to be fused. Back to da grind!"},
{"title": "Persona Q2 - New Cinema Labyrinth: Off to a good start", "date": "05/09/2019", "text": "So, I'm currently playing what will henceforth be known as PQ2. Why make my first foray into the vast and ever-expanding Persona universe with a spinoff series, you may ask — and the second instalment to said spinoff series to boot? Well, the answer is twofold. First, I just purchased this game, and I wanted to indulge in the all-too-rare pleasure of playing a game right upon acquiring it. Secondly, I dislike crossovers as a rule; and thus I wanted to play that game without any knowledge of the Persona lore and pretend that I was dealing with a particularly inventive Etrian Odyssey spinoff.I'll admit it: things didn't go well at first between me and PQ2. I had the fondest memories of Etrian Odyssey's first labyrinth and its soothing vibe — the lush greenery, the ethereal music, the crisp sound of my feet in the grass; so suffice it to say that I was not exactly enthralled by the ugly urban landscape and the faux-jazzy theme track of its PQ2 counterpart. And my gripes with the game didn't stop here: I was also seriously aggravated by the lack of exploring leeway and the overabundance of cutscenes, which contrasted nastily with EO's exhilarating freedom and lack of interference in the player's business. And don't get me started on combat, which managed to be both boring and irritating due to an uncanny combination of overall slowness, hysterical theme track and obnoxious interjections from the crew. Also, why were there so many darn doors to open along the way, and why did opening them always go hand-in-hand with an unskippable animation? In a nutshell: I didn't like what I saw, and I was just an inch from shoving that darn cartridge back into its box after an hour of play.Then I remembered that I was dealing with a spinoff indeed, rather than with a canon EO game; differences were thus unavoidable, and I had to welcome them if I ever wanted to enjoy PQ2. I had to embrace such changes as the cast getting mammoth amount of screen time: while EO gave you blank slates with no backstory, Persona seems to be all about memorable personalities and chara development. I had to come to terms with the absence of the deliciously intimidating vibe that engulfed me whole when I played EO, and embrace the wackier and sparklier vibe of PQ2. I had to suck up the relative lack of freedom, the absence of solo options, and the presence of a story that was more than a mere pretext to roam dungeons. I just had to discover PQ2 and learn to love it for what it was, period.A couple of hours and adjustments later, I can say I reasonably succeeded. Since this is no true blue EO, I had no qualms about selecting the lowest difficulty level — if I have to endure a million cutscenes, better make the ride smooth and relaxing! I then proceeded to study my crew and get to know them inside out — if I have to roll with established characters, better make the most of them indeed! I've also gotten used to the flow of battle, and I'm starting to seriously dig the lively, zany, colourful vibe of the whole game — especially stuff like the All-Out attacks in battle and the characters' flourishes when opening doors, which triggers sweet memories of superhero animes and detective cartoons from my childhood. Last but not least, I play it my way by indulging in as much level-grinding and farming as I want — which probably explains why I still haven't gotten past the 2nd floor after 4 hours of play.And since I'm mentioning this: let's get back to the grind! It's safe to assume I'm on a roll now as far as all things PQ2 are concerned; expect thus more ramblings about that game very soon, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory: All's well that ends well", "date": "01/09/2019", "text": "On every front, mind you — including the narrative one. That story ends up much better than I had dared hope for (spoilers!): Chitose is rescued from the claws of Eden Syndrome without any major sacrifice, Keisuke remains BFF with Yu, Erika gets her dearest wishes granted, Ryuji gets his sanity back, and nobody kicks the bucket. Hooray! The only one suffering is poor Keisuke, who's the sole retainer of memories from the Hudie epopee and now has to live knowing that he'll never again meet Erika. But hey, little Yu is still around, and more than ready to fill in the spot left by Erika — in all possible ways! I deem this ending absolutely perfect: it's bittersweet without being heart-wrenching, and it makes me appreciate the story, and the whole game, even more. (End of spoilers.)Indeed.Not that I really needed more reasons to love HM, mind you: my 52 hours of play were absolutely delightful, and I enjoyed every single minute spent with my Digis. I cannot find a single flaw in that gem of a game — bar maybe the fetch quests, which were as tedious as they were pointless. Why make me look for NPCs all around the place when you could as well have fed me cutscenes, game? Good scenes such missions were few and far between, and the areas involved mercifully small.I'm sure no one will be surprised to hear that the final showdown was a cinch, despite being a two-phase fight. I went at it with an full inventory and a kickass trio made of Dianamon, Ouryumon and Slayerdramon, and I quickly fell into a comfortable — and deadly — battle rhythm: Ouryumon and Slayerdramon dealt the main damage with their Special Moves, while Dianamon dished minor damage and handed healing and replenishing items when necessary. The fight was over in a matter of turns and with no major hassle, giving my run a smooth and satisfying finale. Gee, I love when level-grinding pays off!I don't have much to add, all the less so as a good week has passed since I cleared my run. I loved that game, and I'd sure like to replay it at some point. There's just a small issue: I only have a digital copy, whose perennity is far from being guaranteed. Is it worth investing in a ludicrously priced physical copy, knowing that I already own a physical copy of Digimon Story - Cyber Sleuth, i.e. the original game? I'll mull over it; and as usual, my collector's instinct will have the final word. And now, on to the next game!"},
{"title": "Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory: The Dream Team", "date": "23/08/2019", "text": "Back to business, and back to HM! As I'm inching closer to the final showdown, my party has reached its final form and is now pretty much set in stone. And thus it is time, dear fellow gamers, to let you feast your eyes on the Digis that have cruised with me until now and will keep doing so until the credits roll!Dianamon: My oldest and most beloved Digi, she's been there pretty much since the beginning. She didn't evolve from my starter, but rather from the second Digi I recruited, an unassuming Renamon. I dutifully stuck to the 'rabbit in the moon' branch of her evolution line: not only did it give me the pleasant feeling that I was dealing with the same creature all along, but that branch's forms are all unbearably gorgeous and stylish — and reminded me nicely of Sailor Moon to boot. Her battle prowess is pretty underwhelming, especially in boss fights where she hits like a baby bunny; but she's been at my side for so long that I simply cannot think of letting go of her, no matter how unefficient her punches are.  Hououmon: My second oldest Digi, and probably the most active in battle throughout my run. That fiery bird only took a step back in all things fighting lately, after a very long spell where he was my main asset in random encounters as a Garudamon. Not that it changes anything, mind you; like his fellow Dianamon, Hououmon has been part of my team for so long that I'll stick with him until the end, even if he doesn't lift a feather during the final fight.PlatinumNumemon: A.k.a. It's Raining XP. I have three of them, and it's solely thanks to that trio that my whole party is now lounging at lv. 99 — and thanks to fellow gamer Kumiko, who kindly taught me how to obtain those creatures. I didn't expect any sort of battle prowess — or even assistance — from them, but they pleasantly surprised me by: a) Being sturdy as heck with their absurd 999 defense, and b) Wielding all sorts of useful skills, starting with a revival spell. They also learnt Texture Blow, Character Reversal and Venom Trap through their evolutionary trip; and oh boy, did those skills come in handy indeed — especially the latter, which poisons upon hitting. Poisoning in Digimon is the most vicious thing: not only does it last forever, but poison damage is doubled every turn. Needless to say, I copiously resorted to Venom Trap to get rid of bosses with high defense and HP, with a splash of Character Reversal when necessary and a sprinkle of Texture Blow on top when I was in a really sadistic mood. My three gilded piles of poo can now rest in the back until endgame; their work here is done, and well done.Ouryumon: A.k.a. the Boss Destroyer. That dragon was one of many Digis I raised for experiment and entertainment purposes, and I didn't expect much from him; so imagine my shock when I dragged him from the rearguard to replace a fallen Digi in a boss battle and nuked said boss in two turns with Ouryumon's Special Move! Seriously, Eiseiryuoujin is so utterly broken it's ridiculous. Not only does it land criticals nearly every time, but it's insanely powerful; factor in its wielder's sky-high attack, and you get a real weapon of boss destruction. I swear I took down some HP bags in a matter of turns with that skill, and I wouldn't be surprised if the final showdown turned into a cinch with Ouryumon by my side.MetalGarurumon (Blk), Sakuyamon and Slayerdramon: A.k.a. the tourists. So far, these three haven't strut their stuff much on the battlefield, with each participation being little more than a cameo. They're good and I can clearly see their potential; alas, there's simply not enough room for everybody to shine in that team. Will they get their moment during the final showdown, only time will tell!Although my party is kinda crowded, much more numerous are the Digis I discarded as I cruised through the game. I lost count of the number of creatures I recruited and raised, only to Load them mercilessly as their looks and/or battle prowess failed to enthrall me; one of the first victims of that treatment was none other than my starter Betamon, who turned out to be little more than a placeholder keeping the seat warm until better Digis came along. No loyalty, no shame! That constant raising&recycling of Digis is a tad cruel; however, it's also quite entertaining, and it's undoubtledly a key part of the Digimon series' DNA. And with that, dear fellow gamers, my ode to my party comes to an end. My run is about to as well, so I'll see you soon with the obligatory final post about my Digimon epopee. Come on team, now's the final push!"},
{"title": "Pokemon LeafGreen: The Venusaur Solo Run", "date": "05/08/2019", "text": "It had to come to this: a solo run with the granddaddy of all Grass Starters, the venerable and immensely popular Bulbasaur. And oh boy, is that immense popularity well deserved. I though Treecko was the best Grass Starter the series had to offer; but it turned out that Bulbasaur is even better, and by a couple of leagues to boot. It's sadly ironic that GameFreak managed to nail the Grass Starter formula perfectly the first time around, only to squander their knowledge in the matter and deliver a host of unbalanced Grass Starters as gens went on.Bulbasaur is the utter embodiment of what I've always thought Grass Starters should be: a late-blooming 'Mon with stellar defensive stats and decent attack stats, who slowly but surely grow into a powerhouse as levels pile up. That process is neatly symbolized by the growth of the giant flower on Bulby's back — a coincidence that's too perfect not to be intentional. My first steps with the grassy creature were definitely tedious: while the early Gym Leaders were a cinch, I was routinely hindered by the most unlikely opponents of them all, namely the Bug Catchers littering Kanto. My Bulby (fittingly renamed Hibiscus) was way too weak to take down those pesky insects in one turn (or even two or three, for that matter), especially with his non-effective Grass Moves and the infuriatingly inaccurate Tackle; as a result, battles dragged on, and only Bulby's natural sturdiness prevented him from being knocked out cold before the end of hostilities.Only after Misty's Water Gym did my little Hibiscus become powerful enough to one-shoot the opposition; and from then on, there was no turning back. The rest of my run was a complete cakewalk, with Gym distribution in my favour and random Trainers quickly and neatly submitting to Hibiscus' indomitable strength. The only true issue I encounter while cruising Kanto was PP depletion, which forced me to backtrack to the nearest town on a regular basis; but since I was fortunate enough to get hold of both Fly and the bike early on, those forced detours hardly hurt. But back to combat: I only struggled ever-so-slightly during the Pokemon League showdown, which forced me to strategize for a change; and after hours spent blazing through Kanto with nary a worthy opponent to hinder me, that change of pace at End Game's doors was most welcome.My Move pool was a complete Grass fest: Leech Seed, Vine Whip, Bullet Seed, Giga Drain and Razor Leaf all came to adorn it, and Solar Beam would have too if not for its two-turn nature that makes it totaly unfit for solo endeavours. I was a bit miffed not to be granted an offensive Poison Move that would have taken advantage of Bulby's secondary Type; but with Gen I being Gen I, I cannot even pretend I was surprised by that oversight. I stumbled upon Return by complete happenstance, and was more than delighted to get rid of bloody Tackle; then, I snatched Earthquake in the Viridian City Gym, and slapped it on my Bulby in lieu of the immensely useful but weak Bullet Seed. Better late than never, indeed! Tiny yet eminently efficient, that's how I'd describe Bulbasaur's learnset — especially in Kanto.Since I'm mentioning Kanto, that region was even more impossibly grindy than in my memories — which, as you may imagine, totally delighted me and soon put me in the sweetest trance. What had failed to imprint in my memory, on the other hand, was the annoying segment on the south islands. First, I was forced to cross the darn tedious Pokemon Mansion before I was allowed to tackle the Fire Gym; then, before I could Fly back to the mainland and the next Gym as I planned, I was kidnapped by Bill and sent on a unskippable fetch quest while he chilled out with Celio. Was that part always that irritating? I guess it was, although I failed to remember it. Oh, well.Yup, I've made you my b*tch. Suck it up.At any rate, I'm now done with the Kanto Starters, and I understand better Bulbasaur's enduring popularity. Not only is his design top-notch and totally cohesive with his slow growth, but said slow growth also perfectly complements Charmander's lightning fast one. I'm now itching to replay the Gen I remakes with Squirtle and see if he falls perfectly in the middle. And with that, dear fellow gamers, the 2019 Pokemon Summer Season comes to an end. New gaming shores await! As for blogging, I'll be cut from internet during the next two weeks, so don't worry if you don't hear a peep from me. Or, to quote one sore loser I vanquished not so long ago: smell ya later!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Raichu Solo Run", "date": "29/07/2019", "text": "This is it, dear fellow gamers: after Pikachu and Alolan Raichu, I'm now tackling regular Raichu and clearing my unfinished business with the Pikachu line. And in yet another entry, no less! I've seen enough of Pikachu in Gen I to not want to handle him again in that gen; not only is his battling prowess there pretty underwhelming, but cruising Kanto with him again would be boring as heck. Better let him strut his stuff in mellow Kalos indeed, all the more so as he can be recruited before the first Gym!Since I already have a honest-to-god non-evolved Pikachu solo run under my belt, I had no qualms about letting my kalosian Pikachu cross the evolutionary Rubicon as soon as I got hold of a Thunder Stone. I had even less qualms as he started showing signs of weakness around Ambrette Town, with the Rock Gym being a particularly low point. Only a fiendish combination of Battle Items, avoiding Trainers, the Rocky Helmet, Rock Smash and heaps of luck got me through that roadblock; and as soon as I snatched the Thunder Stone on the outskirts of Cyllage City, I let my Pikachu evolve with a giant sigh of relief.From then on, it was pretty much smooth sailing, with only the occasional tricky battle here and there to ruffle my slick progression. Regular Raichu's learnset is even more impossibly shallow than Pikachu's and Alolan Raichu's, with the use of the Thunder Stone preventing the acquisition of any new Move through leveling-up. My Move pool was pretty much set at the halfway mark, with Return, Grass Knot, Thundershock and Thunder Bolt; I knew from my experience with Pachirisu that such a Move pool worked quite neatly for an Electric 'Mon, so I had no complains at all.Since I really itched to pet Raichu a bit in Pokemon Amie, I used the opportunity to test something I had wanted to verify for the longest time, namely if the XP-boosting effect of the Two hearts of affection and the Lucky Egg add up. The answer is: yep, they do add up. Now that's pure insanity! I rushed through the second half of Kalos like never before, skipping tons of Trainers and racking up Gyms like it was going out of fashion. I also finally dared to give many complimentary areas a pass, just to see if I would miss the items they hosted. The answer is: nope, I did not. Only now can I allow myself to admit how much the overabundance of items in Kalos irritates me, and how much I hate going out of my way just to get a crappy Ball or an healing item I can buy by the dozens. I swear that from now on, I'll only make detours to pick up the Rare Candies and Evolutionary Stones.And with that, I'm done with the Pikachu line for good. What's my verdict, you may ask? Well, good ol' regular Raichu is the best by a long shot, with its one and only Type weakness that makes it superior to his Alolan counterpart and his buffed-up stats that give him an edge compared to his pre-evolution. And talking about this: what was all that fuss about Pikachu not wanting to evolve in the anime because he would get slower in the process? With a speed of 270 at lv.100 without any Nature benefits, my Raichu was crazy fast, and certainly much faster than he was as a mere Pikachu! Ah well, that wouldn't be the first time the anime contradicts the game's lore, now would it? And with those fatalistic words, my work with the series' mascot is done. And also my X&Y adventures for the summer, because I've had my fill of Kalos indeed. I have one more solo run to cover before the 2019 Pokemon Summer Season is over; and then, dear fellow gamers, we can sail together towards new gaming shores!"},

By all accounts, I should see the credits roll around the 50-hour mark, which still kinda surprises me — for even though internet wisdom claimed that HM offered 50-ish hours of play, I somehow didn't want to believe it. But hours fly as missions and chapters roll by, and I finally fathomed that the Digimon series is not going to deliver the same kind of compact, swift runs I've come to expect from the Pokemon series. Which, by the way, is totally fine. It's actually quite awesome to get such different experiences from both series, and to know that each of them can profusely scratch gaming itches that the other one can't come close to reaching. Now I'm dying to try Yo-kai Watch and see where it falls between Digimon and Pokemon.Another thing that wildly differs between HR and your average Pokemon entry is the relationship I'm building with their resident creatures. While I always get that strong, intense bond with my One and Onlies in the latter, I find it a bit harder to get genuinely attached to my team in the former. It's not just the fact that my party is currently teeming with Digis-in-training, with a perverse inverse correlation between the size of my crew and the intensity of my affections; it's also the fact that all the back-and-forth between Digivolutions and the sometimes wild form changes involved in said Digivolutions make it harder to get attached to Digis. I don't really feel — and really don't feel in some cases — like I'm dealing with the same creature at all, and it does a serious number on my fondness for the involved Digi. To alleviate that feeling of alienation, I'm trying my hardest to stick to similar forms into a given Digivolution line, with reasonable success so far. But more on my winning team later!For now, I want to say how much I love the story. I though I wouldn't care whatsoever after a couple of hours, but the opposite is actually happening: I'm getting more and more emotionally involved by the chapter. Oh, how it's gonna hurt when I get slapped in the face by the sad ending — because there's no way this game can end up otherwise than very badly indeed. (Minor spoilers!) My heart already kinda broke when poor Chitose was left with Eden Syndrome; and while I fervently hope there's a way to cure him down the line, I have a hunch that it's gonna involve some heart-wrenching sacrifices. Also, I'd bet my arse that K is actually Yu in disguise; and the though of it really breaks my heart in advance, because I've gotten attached to that shy friend of mine. Or not-so-shy in some cases: I swear my heart skipped a couple of beats during the ferris wheel sequence. Why, I could totally feel the intensity of the boy's repressed lust, and the sheer entanglement of his complicated feelings towards Keisuke. This is not just otome level — it's better than 90% of the otomes I've played.Oh, Yu animal. And oh, Erika. Forget the whole 'Defrosting Ice Queen' theme: she was the one who pierced my heart, as I found myself tearing up during the hugging scene at the end of chapter 11. This was not your usual dere-dere moment, when you're supposed to feel all happy that the cold b*tch finally opened her heart; it was a genuine emotional cracking, a character folding under the pressure and letting it out before composing herself again and getting back into fighting mode. And my, did it feel raw, intense and most, importantly, authentic — the kind of thing that does actually happen IRL. Seriously, my heart totally belongs to Erika and Yu now, which was probably the writers' fiendish intent all along. (End of spoilers.)Also Erika, because I cannot choose. Can I have 'em both, game? Pretty please? Anyway, I followed my fellow gamer Kumiko's wise advice regarding Digi growth; and my team now comprises three PlatinumNumemons that make XP rain on us all. Oh, the glory! Seeing my crew rack up levels so fast all of a sudden had an hypnotizing effect on me, and I'm currently deep into a bout of level-grinding. I'm concurrently starting to figure out the mechanics of skill learning, and thus I'm going to use the opportunity to switch between Digivolutions and have my Digis learn a couple of neat skills for the fights to come. It's pretty safe to assume that my team has now reached its final form and that no new recrue will join the fray in the next five chapters — although you never know, of course; so I'll wait a bit longer for that post about my awesome crew. At any rate, it's back to the grind now — see you later for more juicy Digimon tidings, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Nintendo Switch Lite: Now we're talking", "date": "20/07/2019", "text": "This is it, dear fellow gamers: the much-fabled, much-speculated-about portable-only version of the Switch is about to become reality. And I'm thrilled to bits.The handheld gamer in me is happy beyond belief with that new development. This is not just Nintendo trying to milk their loyal fans by releasing multiple iterations of the same system as usual; the release of a Switch model that's not only smaller than the regular Switch, but also solely portable, is immensely meaningful in the grand scheme of gaming things. This can totally be interpreted as Nintendo acknowledging, if only in a veiled and slightly reluctant way, that handheld gaming is their strongest suit and that they have little to no business anymore in home console gaming. I compare this to the silent ditching of the 3D feature during the 3DS era: first envisioned as the system's main selling point, it quickly became a gimmick 90% of developers couldn't be bothered with, before being unceremoniously sidelined by Nintendo themselves with the release of the 2DS line. Only time will tell if the Switch line follows the same trajectory and if Switch TV playing winds up being the marginal way to play the system; but if things ended up that way indeed in a couple of years, I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest.And then you have the Switch Lite's specs. Not only is it hardly larger than a Vita, but it also boasts a pleasant compactness that screams 'dedicated handheld'. As far as my hands and eyes are concerned, the Switch Lite is the genuine article: a true-blue portable console, with all the cosiness and sweet, sweet sense of intimacy that come along such pieces of kit. And I'm not even talking about the presence of a D-pad and the forever ousting of detachable Joy-Cons. Oh, the joy! (Lousy pun a million times intended.) I absolutely hated playing my big-arse beast of an original Switch; but my hands are now itching to get a hold of the Switch Lite — in every darn sense of the word. And that name! My, it's literally dripping with DS-era nostalgia. Smart move, Nintendo — you sure as heck know how to pull at an handheld gamer's heartstrings when you want it.  If the handheld gamer in me is happy, that's nothing compared to the collector in me. A portable-only, one-unit Switch changes literally everything as far as my collecting is concerned. No detachable Joy-Cons means no future connectivity issues, which in turns means more sturdiness and thus more potential perennity. This means that I can now collect for the Switch Lite, confident that the console will stand the test of time long enough to justify the investment. And let me tell you: that's exactly what I'm going to do.So here's the plan: first, I'm gonna get someone (read: my beloved sister, i.e. my partner in gaming since the dawn of times) to give me a Switch Lite as a Christmas 2019 gift; and then, I'm slowly but surely gonna start collecting for the thing, focusing on games I really crave with all my gamer's soul — with the price tag of Switch games being so routinely high, I want my future Switch Lite collection to comprise only the crème de la crème. I didn't expect things to turn out that way at all; but it seems that my collecting days are not over yet indeed, and that makes me ridiculously happy. Lovely times ahead!"},
{"title": "Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory: A whole new world", "date": "16/07/2019", "text": "There am I, taking my first steps into the second most famous monster-collecting franchise of them all. And my, how auspicious those first steps are indeed! I can totally feel that this game is about to become my new obsession for the next two weeks, oooh yes precious.Granted, the very first steps were not that auspicious. Dare I say that they were a teeny-tiny bit tedious? Yup, I'll say it. The game's weirdly disconnected mission-based structure didn't sit well with me, all the less so as the first missions were aggravatingly boring and handholdy. But then I got some welcome leeway to explore dungeons and build up my team, and things instantly got better. My love for the game has grown stronger ever since, and I expect it to grow even stronger in the next hours: because lo and behold, HM is a dungeon crawler, and dungeon crawlers are me life. Now sure, it leans on the lite side of dungeon crawling, with its pint-sized dungeons, its forgiving random encounter rate and its heavy emphasis on storyline; but still, there's definitely some crawling going on there. I wish the dungeons could be a bit more varied in terms of looks and layout; however, I have to admit that they fit the digital theme perfectly. And it's not like bleak-looking dungeons have ever been a deterrent to roaming&crawling as far as I'm concerned, now is it?I'm still busy discovering the evolution mechanics of that brand-new beastly universe, which seem to have little to nothing in common with the Pokemon ones beyond the basic notion that more levels = more badass creatures. I really like the whole surprise factor involved in Digivolution — although I can already predict that this is gonna lead to a lot of save file reloading. I can also already predict that I'm going to have a hard ride getting used to the ugliest Digis out there, because I'm usually a sucker for looks in those monster-collecting games. But hey, we'll see! The idea that I can choose my own evolutions to a much greater degree than in the Pokemon series is pretty alluring, and it's certainly worth stomaching a couple of weird-looking Digis in the process. For now at least, my little critters are cute as buttons, as they're still lounging in the early evolutionary stages.Did you notice that I wrote 'they're still lounging'? That's right, dear fellow gamers: no solo run in sight here! HM is a game that makes the very concept of a solo run ludicrous, as is liberally grants the exact same amount of XP to all the Digis in the party, regardless of their number. After years of solo runs, I'm more pleasantly surprised than ever when RPGs do that — because it is rare, very rare indeed. The fact that a monster-collecting game, of all RPG subgenres, allows me to do just that is priceless, because it gives me the all-too-rare opportunity to experiment with party dynamics without having to sacrifice my party's growth. This is exactly what I was missing from the Pokemon series, and you can bet your sweet life I'm gonna make the most of it — all the more so as there's no micromanagement involved when it comes to Digi care. How did I get to be so lucky here?What else? The story looks quite decent, but I know myself: I'm probably gonna get stupidly engrossed in crawling and lose track of all things narrative before long. And to be honest, I'm much more interested in the relationships between the characters than in the overarching story right now. Like, is there some actual romancing in HM? I'd sure like to try defrosting my ice queen fellow Hudie hacker Erika, or to get that bromance going with BFF Yu. Pretty please, game? Overall, I must admit that I'm really fond of MC Keisuke: he's kinda bland and goofy, but in a really sweet and endearing way; and his naivety and kindness are cute and refreshing. However, I can sense from the game's tone so far that there's some nasty shit in store for him before the credits roll. My best guess would be Ryuji and/or Erika kicking the bucket, or Yu turning against Keisuke — or all of that at once. It's pretty obvious that we're dealing with a somewhat darker brand of monster-collecting RPG here, and not only on the narrative front — as proven by the 'Game Over' that was shoved in my face when all my Digis fainted. Ouch. After years of running to the next Pokemon Center with no loss of progression whatsoever, that kinda stung.But anyway — so far, so good! I'll see you soon with more progress reports and detailed impressions of my first foray into the Digimon franchise, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading as usual, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon X: The Zangoose Solo Run", "date": "28/06/2019", "text": "When I mentioned in my Seviper solo run report that I expected the snake and the mangoose of the Pokemon world to be polar opposites in terms of capabilities and fighting style, little did I know how utterly right and on the mark I was. While Seviper is a total pushover with useless features and very few good fighting options, Zangoose is a powerhouse with stats that go through the roof and the widest learnset of them all. This is a 'Mon tailor-made for solo runs, and I had tremendous amounts of fun cruising Kalos with that feline bipedal creature. In fact, I daresay that not only is my Zangoose solo run one of my best Gen VI solo runs, but it's also one of my best Pokemon solo runs full stop. Zangoose is on par with the best of them 'Mons — think Piplup or Primarina levels of brokenness and awesomeness — and can pretty much one-shoot its way through any obstacle. Heck, now I want to cruise solo with it in Ruby and see if it's as irresistible in its home region as in Kalos.Zangoose's two main assets stats-wise are its high Speed and its ridiculously high Attack, which pretty much always allow it to strike first and one-shoot opponents — because hey, who wouldn't one-shoot everything that moves with an base Attack of bloody 115? My Zangoose had a Naughty Nature to boot, which meant an even impossibly higher Attack. At the end of my run at lv. 100, she boasted an attack of 331, which I'm pretty sure is one of the highest Attack — if not the highest — of all the 'Mons I ever ran solo with; Roggenrola and Charizard, which were already pretty broken in that department, don't even come close to my Zangoose's sheer offensive power. And what better to compliment such an impossibly high Attack than a learnset bristling with Physical Moves — and ludicrously powerful ones at that? All, and I mean all the offensive Moves Zangoose learns by levelling up are Physical Moves: no trolling à la Pidove, Zangoose is a pure physical attacker — and a beautifully efficient one at that, with Moves that boast a lot of PP and insane accuracy (100% for all Moves, bar two with 95%).All this talk about Moves segues nicely into the next segment, which will be all about Zangoose's Type coverage. More like Zangoose's insane, ludicrous, completely broken Type coverage, really. Fun fact: before that run, I was pretty sure that Zangoose was an Ice 'Mon, due to his fluffiness and colour scheme. I was a trifle disappointed when I realized that I was actually dealing with a Normal 'Mon; but that disappointment evaporated upon discovering the sheer scale of Zangoose's learnset. Zangoose has its fingers in so many pies when it comes to Type coverage that it's actually faster to quote the few Types it cannot dabble in — and that would be Psychic, Water, Dragon, Fairy and Steel. This means a 72% coverage of the Type spectrum, and that's nothing to be sniffed at. While Zangoose's offensive leveling-up learnset comprises solely Normal, Fighting, Bug and Dark Moves, it can gain access to the other nine Types through TMs. For the record, I settled upon Rock Tomb, X-Scissor, Shadow Claw and Return in the late stages of my run, after experimenting with many Moves just for the sheer fun of it. And my, was it a blast.My ode to Zangoose's sheer awesomeness wouldn't be complete without mentioning my intense fondness for that 'Mon. As a solo runner, I'm bound to get attached to my One and Only no matter what; however, there are undoubtedly 'Mons that I end up loving more than others, and Zangoose scores very high on my personal 'Mon Love Chart. So very high, in fact, that it can now claim the honour of being one of my favourite 'Mons ever. I love everything about the Cat Ferret Pokemon, from its colour scheme to its haughty air, without forgetting its wonderfully fluffy tail. I find it unbearably lovely despite its aggressive demeanour, and I couldn't resist petting my little Ivoire a bit in Pokemon Amie. (Although I got her affection up by two hearts only, that was enough to grant her extra XP in battle; combined to her erratic level-up rate, this allowed me to skip many Trainers during the last third of the game, confident that I would hit the big 100 anyway.) And sure, Zangoose is a bipedal 'Mon, and I'm usually not too fond of those; but unlike other 'Mons I won't mention here to preserve their dignity, it's not anthropomorphized to the point of looking ridiculous.Long story short, I love Zangoose to pieces, my solo run with it was pure delight from beginning to end, and I'm totally going to cruise with it again. Heck, I'll even cruise with it in all the games it graces with its forbidding presence if I can pull it off. Thanks for reading as usual, dear fellow gamers, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Seviper Solo Run", "date": "23/06/2019", "text": "For some reason, I really like 'Mons that go in pairs. After having cruised Kalos with its two resident fossils Amaura and Tyrunt, I decided to lavish my attentions on Seviper and Zangoose, a.k.a. the sworn ennemies of the Pokemon world. With a long-running feud as a backstory, I expected that pair of 'Mons to sport opposing battling styles and Move pools, and I was curious to see what they had in store for me. I decided to start with Seviper, because I've been wanting to run solo with a pure Poison 'Mon for, like, ages. At the end of that much-awaited run, my main question was: why? Why does Seviper perform worse on the poisoning department than a 'Mon with Poison as secondary type such as Venipede? Why is Seviper such a one-trick pony, and a pony that cannot even pull out its main trick most of the time? Why so much wasted potential? Why, why, why?Don't get me wrong, dear fellow gamers: I cruised Kalos just fine with the Poison snake, and reached the heights of the Pokemon League without breaking a sweat; so we're dealing with perfectly decent solo run material there. On the other hand, I just cannot wrap my head around how pointless Seviper is on the battlefield. Sure, he has high offensive stats, with a perfect balance between Attack and Sp.Attack; unfortunately, my Seviper's Moves were just a tad too weak to one-shoot everything with abandon, unless a Type weakness or particularly low defensive stats were involved. Seviper is also painfully slow — probably because despite what his name implies, he's actually closer to an anaconda when it comes to measurements. As far as my run was concerned, this means that blows were traded more often than not: and with Seviper's HP and defensive stats being as crappy as they are, I suffered quite a lot of damage on a regular basis. Hits from opposing 'Mons routinely drained a good third, if not half of my Seviper's life bar, and I had to keep him on a constant potion diet — I used more than 100 potions during that run, and that's my personal record in a Pokemon solo run. And mind you, all that happened with the benefit of overleveling. That probably means that in a regular run, Seviper can hardly ever strike first and cannot survive even one hit in most cases. So I have to ask: what's the point of that 'Mon? What's his fighting niche?He's not a good poisoner, that's for sure. He doesn't have an awesome auto-poisoning ability such as Venipede's Poison Point, and his poisoning Moves fail most of the time because of the low probabilities involved. Take Poison Jab, a Move I spammed during most of my run: I can honestly count on the fingers of two hands, three at most, the number of times I managed to poison something. This means that Venoshock, a Move my Seviper also wielded and whose power is increased in case the target is poisoned, never got to live to its full potential. And weirdly enough, none of Seviper's Status Poison Moves can inflict poisoning: they are solely buffing and debuffing Moves that affect stats and abilities. Whats' the point of such Moves, when it's not even guaranteed that Seviper can strike first and survive the first hit? And how come a Poison 'Mon can poison so little? It doesn't help that Seviper's learnset is on the narrow side, with mostly Poison and Dark Moves at his disposal; as for his Shed Skin Ability, it would have been awesome if not for the fact that it only has a 30% chance of triggering. I can honestly count on the fingers of one hand the number of times Shed Skin triggered over the course of my run.So let's sum up: serviceable yet not outstanding offensive stats, low defensive stats and low speed, Status Moves hampered by said low speed, shitty poisoning capabilities, narrow learnset and borderline useless Ability. We have to face the sad truth here: Seviper sucks hard, and I can only hope that Zangoose fares better when it comes to fighting prowess and overall balance. Let's check that without delay, now shall we? Until then, dear fellow gamers, thanks for reading as usual, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon White 2: The Audino Solo Run", "date": "18/06/2019", "text": "Although things didn't quite work out between me and Omega Ruby, I couldn't get that Audino solo run out of my head. I really wanted to cruise around with that cute creature, preferably immediately. I wanted it so bad, in fact, that I even felt ready to renounce Mega Evolution for the time being. That's when I remembered that Audino is a Gen V 'Mon that appears really early on, and that I hadn't played White&Black 2 since 2017. And with that, the die was pretty much cast; and it wasn't long before I was rushing through Unova with abandon and that adorable pink and white creature by my side.Audino's colour scheme actually reminded me of strawberry and vanilla ice cream, which is why I named him 'Gelato'. I fully expected him to be one of those 'Mons that are good for little beyond being unbearably cute; but he took me by surprise by holding his own like a boss on the battlefield. He held his own so well, in fact, that he became able to one-shoot the opposition right after the Second Gym and never stopped after that. Sure, his learnset is not quite tailor-made for solo runs, with way too many status effect Moves learnt upon leveling up; but he still managed to make the most of the few offensive Moves he had access to.I had to rely on Return, Double Slap and Secret Power, complete with Refresh, during the early stages of my run; and while that Move pool was efficient enough given the benefit of the STAB, it still had the potential to land me in hot water against Ghost 'Mons. A change was in order; and as soon as I could, I traded Double Slap for Signal Beam — soon followed by Shadow Ball and Psychic, which came to replace Refresh and Secret Power. Return obviously didn't go anywhere, and remained my surefire one-shooter all the way to the Pokemon League. I got to upgrade my Move pool once again right before Victory Road, when I got hold of Flamethrower, Ice Beam and Thunderbolt in one fell swoop — better late than never, indeed! Needless to say, the Pokemon League was very much a one-shooting festival, and I was crowned Champion after 13 hours of delightful roaming.I was actually surprised by the length of my run. Those 13 hours felt much shorter, and this is in no small part due to BW2's utterly stellar pacing. I'll say it: when it comes to all things pacing, that pair is my absolute favourite in the whole series. Never before — or since, for that matter — has progression been so smooth and effortless in a Pokemon game, with HMs being handed to you long before you even need them and milestones flowing naturally into one another. Dungeons are a delight to explore and open areas a delight to roam, leaving you sated without being bored. And beyond that most excellent pacing, there is a real sense of urgency at work in the whole game: battles are more frantic than ever before (or since), biking is crazy fast, you can run indoors, and the game does everything it can to spare you trips through the menu. I daresay that BW2 perfectly managed to capture and convey the feverish quality of urban american lifestyle; and my, was such a move very welcome indeed after the sheer sluggishness of Gen IV.Rediscovering BW2 after a whole two years away from Gen V was pure and utter delight. I swear those games are just tailor-made for solo runs, with Return being handed to you right after the first Gym and the Lucky Egg right before the sixth, and tall grass teeming with wild Audinos. In fact, it makes things nearly too easy. Oh, who am I kidding? I just love it, and I totally wish all Pokemon games could emulate that awesome arrangement! I also came to terms with the fact that my Trainer plays somewhat of a secondary role in the narrative and just goes with the flow. There's actually something strangely refreshing in being a bit of an observer in other people's stories, and simply giving a hand as you go along instead of being the driving force behind all things narrative. At least I'm not pitted alone against a whole villain team this time around, and everybody cooperates and contributes to save Unova from a new ice age — about time, shall I say!I also have to admit that with hindsight, Hugh is actually my favourite of all the post-Gen IV friendly rivals. His tale of revenge and retrieval makes him kinda relatable, but not to the point of making him endearing: he remains standoffish enough to be stimulating to beat (gotta show that bossy prick I'm not his personal slave, indeed!) and there's always a modicum of welcome distance between my Trainer and him. I would describe our relation as a reluctant partnership: it's pretty clear we're not best buddies and probably won't ever be — and as far as friendly rivalvry in Pokemon goes, I'd have this any day of the week over 'rivals' fawning over me or wanting to be my BFF.Now that I reacquainted myself with the awesomeness of BW2, I have a number of solo runs lined up for the pair. Also, I officially declare that all my BW2 runs to come will solely feature the female Trainer; I just cannot for the life of me deal with how utterly crappy the male Trainer looks, from his horrendous haircut to his ugly outfit — without forgetting his lousy poses. And why on earth does he look so much younger than the female Trainer? I totally feel like I'm Hugh's little b*tch when I play with that scrawny male Trainer, and I'm not having any of it. I'd rather have his more assertive and older-looking female counterpart, thank you very much! And with that, dear fellow gamers, I'll see you soon for more Gen V tidings. Thanks for reading as usual, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Emerald: The Sceptile Solo Run", "date": "14/06/2019", "text": "I'll tell you what, my dear fellow Pokefans: at that point, I thought I'd never live to see a dope Grass Starter with one-shooting potential. I had basically renounced the whole Type entirely and accepted the idea that Grass 'Mons in general, and Grass Starters in particular, were simply not good solo run material — not strong enough to wipe the battlefield clean in one turn, and too fragile to wipe it clean in two turns. But that was before my little Rainforest came, and showed me the potential of his Type in the most brilliant and satisfying way. The little gecko decidedly breaks the Grass Starter mold by boasting high Speed and Sp.Attack along with really decent Attack, which in turns makes him a genuine one-shooter. I've long waited for the day I'd be able to wreak havoc on a region's fauna with Grass Moves, and Treecko was the one who humoured me at long last. He deserves every ounce of the praise that's been lavished on him since he appeared, and even more.Treecko's learnset is pleasantly varied, especially for a Grass Starter: he has access to Fighting and Ground Moves despite being pure Grass Type, and I definitely made the most of that versatility. I operated with two Move pools over the course of my run: Secret Power, Pursuit, Leaf Blade and Absorb during the early stages, and Leaf Blade, Return, Brick Break and Earthquake during the late stages. I find pretty interesting that all three Gen III Starters can learn Earthquake and Brick Break; needless to say, those two Moves came in really handy in all things Pokemon League — and before that, for that matter. As a Grass 'Mon, Treecko had the added benefit of wielding draining Moves and being able to heal himself while taking down the opposition, and I took full advantage of this. And Leaf Blade! With hindsight, that is the name I should have given my Treecko; because that Move was awesome indeed, and it stayed in my pool during my whole run, wreaking havoc on the battlefield with its high critical hit ratio. Oh, and the game was kind enough to offer me the Champion crown on a silver platter by pitting me against Wallace. Like, Wallace, the former Water Gym Leader. Easiest. Champion. Fight. EVAH. Long story short, Treecko is dope, and I loved him to pieces. Alas, I cannot say that much about Emerald itself: that darn game aggravated me in ways I didn't think possible. I know it's supposed to be the ultimate Gen III entry; but honestly, I find Ruby and Sapphire ten times better. For once, they boast a much better pacing; Emerald, on the other hand, makes everything slower by sneaking in useless diversions and fluff. Having to invade Team Magma's brand-new hideout was totally superfluous and uncalled for, just like having to climb the Sky Pillar just to wake up Rayquaza — especially when the game doesn't even have the decency to tell you exactly where said new hideout and Sky Pillar lie, preferring instead to feed you vague directions and let you fumble around like a fool.Even worse is Emerald's compulsion to interrupt my swift progress by any means necessary. Not only did every Trainer and their brother force their Pokenav number on me after battle like total creeps, but there was also that Scott guy following me through Hoenn. (Never even found out what that guy's purpose was, beyond looking like a stalking pedo.) Wait, is that game actually trying to make me socialize? Anathema! Over my dead body! And then, you have those cursed Double Battles, which I despise with every fibre of my being. It's bad enough that Emerald forces you to tackle those battles upon eye contact, unlike Ruby and Sapphire where you had to talk to Trainer duos to engage them; but Emerald also literally tries to trick you into Double Battles by hiding Trainers behind scenery elements. How foul can you be, game? This is despicable! I really shouldn't have to watch my every step to avoid bumping into a Trainer viciously hidden behind a rock or a tree. Do you know how many times I had to reload my save just to spare myself the hassle of fighting yet another endless Double Battle and having precious XP diverted from my little Rainforest? I'll tell you: way too many times. Sure. Prepare to DIE.My run ended up clocking at a bloated 11 hours because of those constant nuisances and obstructions; that totally stank, especially after my super-swift Torchic and Mudkip runs. And thus I do declare that henceforth,  Emerald is persona non grata as far as Gen III dealings are concerned. I'd much rather stick with the original Gen III entries and their perfectly efficient pacing, all the more so as Emerald adds literally nothing of value to those games as far as I'm concerned. But still; I did what I set out to do, i.e. polish off three Starters runs in all three Gen III instalments. And with that, I'm now sailing towards other, newer Pokemon Gens! Stay tuned for more solo Pokemon goodness, dear fellow gamers — the 2019 Pokemon Summer Season is nowhere near done indeed! Thanks for reading as always, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sapphire: The Swampert Solo Run", "date": "09/06/2019", "text": "Here we go again with Gen III! Dear fellow gamers, may I present you with my Mudkip run of Sapphire, featuring the aptly named Tidal Wave and clocking at a tiny 7h45 of delightful roaming — my newest record! Gee, we're nearly treading on speedrun territory at that point! I'm getting much better at exploiting Hoenn's cleverly designed map to save playtime and enhance that sweet, sweet rushing feeling I love to get from my Pokemon runs in general, and from my Gen III runs in particular. I mean, Hoenn seems to have been designed with speed and efficiency in mind: if you play your cards right, you can cross the whole region without backtracking a single time! And some sections can be short-circuited entirely with no consequences whatsoever, such as Routes 120 to 134. I'm never setting foot again in Pacifidlog Town, let me tell you that.With his supremely balanced stats and his double Water-Ground typing that leaves him with but a single weakness, Mudkip had the potential to be one of the most badass Water Starters — like, Piplup levels of badassery; but alas, the little amphibian is severely let down by his learnset, which is infested with moves with low accuracy. Low accuracy and one-shooting at first turn don't go well together, and Tidal Wave's imprecise move pool really affected the smoothness of my progression. Or at least, it did until I cleared Petalburg City's Gym, after which the tables were suddenly turned move-wise: literally from one Gym to the next, I got hold of Surf, Ice Beam, Return and Earthquake, and the face of my run was changed forever. After that, it was pretty much guaranteed one-shooting all the way to the Champion — no Battle Items, no hassle. One more Gen III Starter Run polished off with honours, next please!I also got the answer to the question raised by my Torchic run, i.e. is May as much of a giant douchebag as Brendan? The answer is limpid: yes, she is — although we're dealing with a different type of douchiness there. Her way of throwing shade at your Trainer is much subtler than Brendan's, and cuts all the deeper for it. She looks nice enough at first sight, with her cute shyness and apparent friendliness; but she reveals her true colours soon enough. See, May is so happy with herself and so darn self-sufficient that she couldn't care less about having a rival. I used to think that she was a loser for focusing on discovering all species of Pokemons more than on battling me; but I realize now that I was the loser here, at least in her eyes. As far as she's concerned, I'm totally not worthy of obsessing over, and thus she does her thing and royally ignores me. Ouch, the shade. The only times May bothers giving me attention is when she wants to use me as a convenient foil to rub her overinflated ego — and boy, does she try hard to take the credit indeed, claiming that I got stronger for her sake and that our past battles inspired me to better myself. Erm, excuse me? You're not the bloody centre of the Universe here, let alone the centre of my universe. And sure enough, she tried to sneak into the trophy room with me, just like that dirty little minx Brendan. Savage! And yet: even though I'm the butt of the joke here, I have to tip my hat to GameFreak for coming up with subtler styles of rivalvry that time around, as well as two vastly different yet just as potent brands of shadiness. Brendan and May are the most insulting and infuriating rivals ever, and that also makes them the most brilliant and efficient ones. Two down, one to go! Treecko's stellar reputation preceeds him, and I sure hope he will offer me a Grass Starter solo run worthy of the name. I'll see you soon with lush tidings of Emerald, dear fellow gamers; until there, thanks for reading as usual, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Omega Ruby: Count me out", "date": "05/06/2019", "text": "I'm sorry, I cannot do this. I want to love and play that game, but it's just not working. At all.It really should have, mind you. I love Gen III as a whole, and I chose one of my favourite 'Mons out there as my opener for those remakes, i.e. the adorable Skitty — the idea being to polish off a solo run with a Cute Charm Delcatty, thus coming full circle in all matters Skitty. After my delightful run of Sapphire with a non-evolved Skitty, that run with the fully evolved feline should have been a total walk in the park; and yet, I found myself struggling. My Move pool is crappy beyond belief even after five darn Gyms, and my lv.52 Delcatty still has a hard time one-shooting foes. Bloody GameFreak locked Ice Beam behind the Dive wall, effectively preventing me from upgrading my Move pool early on; and since I have yet to go back to Fallarbor to snatch Return, I'm stuck with low-tier Moves such as Assist and Faint Attack. This is just not fun, and this is so not what I signed for: I expected to get an easier and smoother ride with a fully evolved Skitty, not a harder and more tedious one.However, my unexpected struggles with Delcatty are but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to my issue with ORAS. I'm gonna try to say this as delicately as possible: from the bottom of my heart, I curse GameFreak for the changes they introduced in those remakes. Them fools basically destroyed what was in my opinion the biggest strengths of the Gen III games; namely the swift pacing, the adventurous feel and the near-perfect layout of Hoenn. Gone is the heady rush of running at a breakneck pace through the entire region, from beaches to mountain tops: progression in OR feels sluggish as all heck, a feeling considerably worsened by the abundance of useless cutscenes. It's not nearly as bad as in Sun&Moon, granted; but it's kinda worse than in X&Y, and progression really suffers from it. My save file reads 7:42, and yet I'm barely beyond the fifth Gym; in RSE, I'd already be lounging in Sootopolis, or even striding through Victory Road. And you can also forget about cruising it your way in those remakes. RSE left you to your own devices, free to explore and roam around at will and leisure; ORAS, on the other hand, want you on rails and nowhere else. One telling example will suffice to express the depths of my contempt for that new approach: after showing my deadbeat dad who's the real family don in Petalburg City, I always fancy Surfing through Routes 105 to 109 and challenging all the Trainers on my way, before landing in Slateport and taking a right turn at Mauville to rally the newly opened Route 118. Smooth, effortless and perfect. That detour is my little treat; so why did GameFreak feel compelled to take that simple pleasure away from me and force me to follow Wally to Mauville right after I conquered the Petalburg Gym? This is my journey, dang it! Let me travel to places the way I see fit, and drop the bloody handholding already, will ya?And since I'm mentioning Mauville... Why, GameFreak? WHY? What was wrong with the original Mauville, to make you want to overhaul it so completely? It was just perfect as it was, cosy and tiny and homely. The very last thing I wanted in my Pokemon was another architectural disaster of Lumiose City proportions! There was absolutely no need to make Mauville's so darn complicated and so ridiculously enormous. And the latter doesn't just affect Mauville, mind you: all scales have been enlarged, just because. Everything is way too big in ORAS, and the weird camera angles make things even worse. The marvelously efficient layout of RSE is shattered beyond belief, and the player is left with a disfigured Hoenn that's painfully confusing and tedious to scale — in every darn sense of the word. GameFreak probably realized that they screwed up, because they kinda shrank things again in Sun&Moon; but the damage is done as far as ORAS as concerned.Those nearly eight hours were a trudge, let me tell you that. It started nicely enough, mind you: the game's overall vibe stood pleasantly halfway between X&Y and Sun&Moon, and I was thrilled to rediscover Hoenn under that new graphical guise. But then came the handholding, the cutscenes and the enormous areas, and I had to endure obstruction after obstruction. I was sorely tempted to give up several times; yet the thought that better Moves and one-shooting were somewhere down the line kept me going, along with the desire to get my paws on some Mega Stones and pave the way for future runs. But ironically enough, that last point was actually my undoing: my will to crawl ORAS ultimately broke when Stephan kidnapped me on Route 123 and took me to some remote island to snatch the Key Stone. Oh heck no. I was on my merry way to the Weather Institute, and I just couldn't muster the strength to tackle that diversion even if my life depended on it.And that's how I turned off my 2DS and shoved my OR cartridge back into its box, not to be touched for a very long time. See you, so long, goodbye, hooray! Mind you, I'm not swearing off those remakes just yet. I still hold onto my fantasy of an Audino Solo Run with ME included; and beyond that, I'm aware that a lot of my current repulsion towards ORAS stems from the sheer contrast with RSE. I simply cannot play the originals and the remakes at the same time or in quick succession; if I ever want to play the latter again, I have to let a lot of time pass, and get used to the idea that I'm basically dealing with a completely different pair of games, with an atmosphere of their own. I mean, it's pretty much like that with every single Pokemon remake; I just have to suck it up. And if it turns out during my next playthrough that I just cannot get used to these games after all, then I'll pawn them without regret. And that, dear fellow gamers, marks the end of all ORAS tidings for now. Thanks for reading as usual, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Ruby: The Blaziken Solo Run", "date": "01/06/2019", "text": "As I was cruising Hoenn with Dustox and Beautifly, a shocking fact suddenly dawned on me: Gen III was the only Pokemon gen whose starters I had yet to put to the solo run test. How could this happen? How on earth could I give those three a pass for so long? As I was busy trying to wrap my head around that unfathomable reality, another shocking fact fell on me like a ton of bricks: Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire were still sitting unplayed in my collection! Oh, the shock! Once I was done recovering from the enormity of the situation, I obviously had to do something to fix it, and no later than right now. The best course of action would have been to kill two birds with one stone and play some Starter runs in ORAS; however, I was kinda reticent to do that. Not only does my purist mind rather want to experience the Gen III Starters in their original environment, so to speak; but I also absolutely hate their sprites in ORAS. And thus my decision was taken: those Starter Runs would unfold in the original Gen III entries, and I'd keep ORAS for other runs — like, an Audino Solo Run with Mega Evolution on top.And of course, I'd have the Starters' types match with the names and colours of the games — just because I can, and because the correlation is too utterly perfect to let it slip. And since the games' names would be monopolized by my Trainers already, I would craft fancy names tied to the Starters' types. And thus: dear fellow gamers, please give a warm welcome to my little Fire Storm! He's every bit your typical Fire Starter: fast and powerful, and very much a one-shooter indeed. Cruising Hoenn with that bipedal bird was complete piece of cake, and I never had to worry about my HP bar whatsoever. Even the Rock Gym, which could have proved a handful due to poor timing and type matching, was a complete walk in the park due to my Torchic already wielding Double Kick at the time. From then on, it was pretty much a one-shooting festival all the way to the Pokemon League, despite my lacklustre Move pool.Indeed, Torchic is not blessed with the same bottomless learnset as, say, fellow Fire Starter Charmander; instead, the little chick has to make do with a small variety of Moves that don't always take full advantage of his double type. I spent an inordinate amount of time hanging onto Double Kick and Ember, completed with Slash and whatever else I found on my way, from Aerial Ace to Hidden Power. Only in the latter stages of my run was I able to put together a Move pool worthy of a Starter — namely Overheat, Brick Break, Earthquake and Return; and mind you, even that quatuor didn't completely solve my Move issues. Overheat in particular was really unwieldy due to its combined low PP, lack of precision and stat-lowering side effect, and it nearly put me in a bind against Phoebe's flying Ghost 'Mons. But everything worked fine in the end, and I was crowned Champion after roughly 9 hours of cruising through Hoenn — making that run my shortest Pokemon solo run so far.After five runs of Gen III, I though I knew those games well enough; but it turned out that there was still plenty of room for detail-spotting and quirky discoveries. Like, how could I not realize earlier that Wallace, the resident Water Gym Leader, keeps a whole harem in the basement of his Gym? That's hilariously pervy and creepy! Also, why do I always, always fall prey to that troll rider on the cycling road repeating 'Rydel' a million times? Next time I'll steer clear of him by a wide berth, I swear. And last but not least, how on earth did I fail to notice until now that Brendan is a massive douchebag, and probably one of the most unsufferable rivals to ever (dis)grace the series? The little prick hits you below the belt right away, when he sniffs at your Trainer being female despite being a Gym Leader's child. Now looka here, you dirty punk: I don't have a PhD in genetics, but I'm pretty sure there's no natural law stating that Gym Leaders have to sire male offspring only. Go and reread your Mendel, will ya?How would you like my hand in your face?And this is but the beginning, because bloody Brendan basically spends the rest of the game throwing shade at you — all the way to the Pokemon League, where he dares butting in after your fight with the Champion to offer some advice (as if) and tries to sneak into the trophy room with you. The nerve! Trying to steal my spotlight like that, after hours spent scoffing and sneering at me? Why, you dirty little minx. The core issue with Brendan is that he basically doesn't acknowledge you as a rival, and deems you totally unworthy of his attention. Heck, you can nearly hear him roll his eyes and grimace in disgust every time he deigns talking to you; you betrayed his expectations by being a female, and from that point on, you're worth less to him than the dirt under his shoes. As I said: WORST. RIVAL. EVAH. Now I'm dying to play with the male Trainer and see if May is just as odious as him.And since I'm mentioning this, it's time to wrap up that post and dive senselessly into Sapphire along Water Starter Mudkip! Stay tuned for the inevitable ensuing run report, dear fellow gamers; and as always, thanks a million for reading!"},
{"title": "Pokemon X: The Sylveon Solo Run", "date": "25/05/2019", "text": "Here comes my second Eevee run, dear fellow gamers! After little Flareon, it's time for the Kalos variety of Eevee to be put to the test. Is Sylveon an ace in his home region? Well, he kinda is indeed! That most frilly fox boasts three assets that make him a 'Mon of choice in Kalos: first, he's a true powerhouse on the Special front, with a pretty high HP to boot. Secondly, he has the learnset to match, full of powerful Special Moves. Last but not least, his Type weaknesses, Poison and Steel, are hardly a hindrance in Kalos: there's nary a Poison 'Mon around, and Steel 'Mons hardly ever appear before the Elite Four. Overall, pure Fairy Type works really well in X&Y; and while having a 'Mon perform honourably in his debut game may seem like the most obvious thing in the world, local Raichu's poor solo performance in Alola has proven that it's far from being a given. So let's rejoice, and let's enjoy the awesomeness of the Fairy Type on its oh-so-frenchy turf. When it comes to Moves, cruising with Sylveon was very much a case of being content with what you have and making the most of it. The Fairy Eevee has a tiny offensive learnset by default, with only twelve offensive Moves available through TM and nine by leveling up. The latter include four Special Fairy Moves of various power, a perfect setting for Sylveon given the combination of his high Sp. Attack and the STAB. But wait, there's a catch — and a massive one at that. See, Sylveon learns three of those Fairy Moves before lv. 20; yet in X&Y, Eevees can only be recruited right after the second Gym, at lv. 20-22. Heck, I think we all see the big issue here: in a regular X&Y run with no breeding involved, you're gonna miss on Sylveon's first three Fairy Moves no matter what; and by the time you reach the Move Reminder, you won't have any use for these Moves anymore because of their low power. GameFreak visibly spotted the problem and tried to mitigate it in Gen VII, by making Sylveon learn Fairy Wind upon evolving; you still miss out on Disarming Voice and Draining Kiss in the process, but I guess that's better than nothing. Getting deprived of three quarters of Sylveon's Fairy Moves is already galling enough, but that's not even the end of Sylveon's learnset troubles. The Fairy fox-meets-rabbit suffers from what I dubbed 'The Great Move Gap': he doesn't learn any offensive Moves by leveling up between lv. 20 and lv. 37. Add to this the fact that the offensive TMs he can learn appear very late in the game, and you get the situation I wound up in during my run: until my Sylveon reached lv. 37, I was stuck with the base offensive Move pool he wielded as an Eevee — namely Quick Attack, Bite and Swift. I managed to make do with those Moves pretty neatly, shall I say: Swift as my main choice, Quick Attack to finish foes, and Bite for anything immune to Normal. Still, as I saw levels pile up and no new Moves come my Sylveon's way, the whole thing started to look like GameFreak was taking the piss out of me, and I seriously wondered if we were dealing with some trolling of Pidove proportions there.But then came the fated lv. 37; and oh dear, was it a turnaround indeed. Moonblast: Fairy Special Move, 95 power — nuff said. My Sylveon was still just as starved of Moves as before, but he suddenly became able to one-shoot everything with abandon. Needless to say, I spent the rest of my run spamming Moonblast. Even after I got hold of Psychock and Shadow Ball in the late stages of the game, Moonblast remainded my go-to Move thanks to its enormous power and the STAB. I really cherished that Move, because of how long I had to wait before I got hold of it and how much it changed my fighting fortunes. But I cherished even more Swift, which remained in my Move pool during the whole game. As a multi-target Special Move with 60 power, it remained relevant all the way to the Pokemon league, and I always found good uses for it. Fun fact: in french, that Move is called 'Meteors', which I deem ten times more evocative than Swift — on top on hinting nicely at the multi-targeting capability of that Move.In the end, Sylveon exceeded all my expectations. This is not the most popular eeveelution of them all, and I half-feared that he would let me down on the battlefield; but despite his tiny learnset, my Sylveon did a great job on that front and conquered the Pokemon League without breaking a sweat. See you soon for more Pokemon goodness, dear fellow gamers! Until then, as usual: thanks for reading, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire: The Dustox&Beautifly Solo Runs", "date": "21/05/2019", "text": "Although Gen III has a lot of flaws and is still deemed the black sheep of the franchise by many a Pokefan, one thing it did right was to lavish some much-needed love on Bug 'Mons. Hoenn is home to some of the most inventive bugs ever to grace the Pokemon world, starting with Wurmple and its two random-yet-not-quite evolutions. This concept was a pure stroke of genius on GameFreak's part: you can feel the suspense grow until your Wurmple reaches lv.7, after which you know at long last if you landed your dream version of the bug. Because indeed, Dustox and Beautifly, while being pretty similar, are still different enough in terms of looks and stats to make sure that you'll set your sights on one of the two. Dustox wields powerful Psychic Moves and is backed up by solid defensive stats, while Beautifly has access to a whole range of draining Grass Moves and boasts great offensive stats. For the record, I was lucky enough to secure the version I wanted in both of my runs, which saved me considerable amounts of time and grinding.   Dustox in Ruby: Dustox is my favourite of the pair when it comes to looks — although unfortunately, I didn't get to admire said looks as much as I would have liked, because the poor thing is nearly entirely buried behind the battle display. Come on GameFreak, what were you thinking? Dustox and his pretty wings deserved more love — and room — than that, seriously. But enough with the poison moth's looks; let's now talk about his stats and Move pool, which had me worried for a while. Dustox sure is a great defensive 'Mon, but he's a teeny-tiny bit weak on the offensive front; combine this with a tiny levelling-up learnset nearly entirely devoid of STAB — one Bug Move and no Poison Moves — and you'll understand why I was pretty much convinced that my Dustox Solo Run was going to be a bit of a pain in the behind. But lo and behold, the colourful moth surprised me by holding his own on the battlefield much better than I expected. Now, I won't lie and say that one-shooting was our bread and butter, because the truth is that my Dustox usually needed two turns to take down foes. This could have been an issue if not for the moth's excellent defensive stats, which allowed him to take a million hits comfortably while he did his thing.Long story short, I had a great time roaming Hoenn with my Dustox. There were a couple of roadbloacks along the way, obviously — although funnily enough, said roadblocks weren't quite what I expected. For instance, I fully expected Rustboro's Rock Gym to be a handful; but thanks to my Dustox wielding Confusion at the time, it was mostly a cakewalk. The real roadblock was the Lavaridge Fire Gym — or, more precisely, Flannery's Torkoal. While my Dustox had neatly handled every single Trainer in the Gym, he was suddenly powerless in front of that damn turtle. Torkoal always used Overheat on the first turns, which pretty much meant one-shooting despite my Dustox' high defenses; as for one-shooting Torkoal before she could one-shoot me, it was pretty darn impossible.I ultimately won that fight using a mix of luck and strategy: first, I spammed Silver Wind on the first turns while facing Flannery's Slugma, until my stats had been raised at least twice; I could then survive Overheat and use the subsequent lowering of Torkoal's Sp.Defense to destroy her with Confusion. After that, it was pretty much smooth sailing until the final showdown against the Champion, which proved to be the second real roadblock of my run; however, battle items and Silver Wind did the trick and gave my Dustox the offensive oomph it needed to win that ultimate fight. For the record, my final Move pool comprised Shadow Ball, Psychic, Aerial Ace and Silver Wind, a neatly balanced Physical/Special combination that allowed me to dispose of most of the Hoenn fauna comfortably. Beautifly in Sapphire: Beautifly being the offensive half of the Wurmple evo duo, I fully expected to have an easy ride with him; and while he certainly one-shot foes on a much more regular basis than Dustox, my run was not exactly as smooth as I'd expected. Just like with Dustox, the Rock Gym was a walk in the park, and that was entirely due to my Beautifly wielding Absorb: the super-effectiveness of that Grass Move against Rock, combined with its draining ability, was enough to virtually  erase Beautifly's double weakness to Rock. This was the first sign that draining Grass Moves were going to be an enormous asset for my Beautifly, allowing him to heal while hitting and thus compensating for his low defenses; and from that moment on, there was always such a Grass Move in my Move pool — first Absorb, then Mega Drain, and finally the awesome Giga Drain.This time around, the biggest roadblock of them all was a Gym I hadn't even noticed when cruising with Dustox: the Mauville Electric Gym, i.e. the harbinger of doom. Getting rid of the Gym Trainers was easy enough; but then came Wattson and his Magneton, and the party was suddenly over. Not only did that floating piece of junk resisted all the Moves I wielded at the time, but my poor Beautifly, unlike his fellow Dustox, was weak to Electric. And with Magneton spamming Shock Wave and Thunder Wave, the fight was pretty much over before it started. Despite being faster than Magneton, Beautifly was not strong enough to one-shoot it; and once Magneton fired back, there was no way to survive the hit because of Beautifly's low defenses and his weakness to Electric. Since Electric was classified as Special in Gen III, my first reaction was to purchase a crap ton of X Sp.Defenses to survive Magneton's attacks; but to my utter horror, I discovered that X Sp.Defenses simply don't exist in Ruby&Sapphire. I could have rolled with X Attacks instead; however, with my defenses being as low as they were and Wattson's 'Mons all wielding Electric Moves, I was just totally doing to faint before I could gobble enough X Attacks to guarantee one-shooting. And thus, the only option left was to level-grind. I was already at lv.33 at that time, and wild 'Mons only yielded one pixel of XP; needless to say, I wasn't extatic at the prospect of grinding the half-dozen levels I deemed necessary to survive Magneton's hits.I started grinding nonetheless; and as I reached lv.34, the tables were turned forever as my Beautifly learnt Silver Wind. Oh, the joy! Oh, the relief! With Silver Wind and a good dose of luck, I could gain that defensive boost I needed so terribly, along with a much-welcome offensive boost; with a handful of X-Attacks on top of that, surely I would be able to knock down Magneton while surviving his electric assaults, wouldn't I? I lunged back at Wattson with a vengeance; and sure enough, things unfolded exactly as written above. I was simply amazed at how a single Move could change my fighting fortunes so drastically, as I don't remember this ever happening before. After that, we were on a roll and things went smoothly until the fight against the Champion; just like Dustox, Beautifly needed a hefty dose of Battle Items to win that ultimate showdown. There was no Silver Wind spamming, though: my final Move pool comprised Aerial Ace, Return, Giga Drain and Shadow Ball, which amply proves that Dustox and Beautifly can end up with nicely different Move pools despite evolving from the same creature.Long story short, cruising Hoenn with these two butterflies was delightful. I actually have a soft spot for Bug 'Mons: I see them as the purest embodiment of the whole Pokemon solo run experience, i.e. take a weak 'Mon and patiently mold it into a fighting powerhouse, sticking with it through thick and thin. Bug 'Mon are absurdly weak in their first evolutionary stage, while still not being as utterly useless or trolly as baby 'Mons or Magikarps; but at time and levels fly by, they become increasingly more powerful, until they can hold their ground against a region's whole fauna. I'm certainly not done with Hoenn's bugs: get ready to cruise with me, Ninjask and Shedinja! I'll see you later with more buzzy Bug 'Mon tidings, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, thanks for reading, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Absol Solo Run ", "date": "17/05/2019", "text": "Since it has now been proven that I can run solo with traded 'Mons in X&Y, the time was ripe for me to dabble into Mega Evolution. I was always forced to give that appetizing feature a pass in my solo runs, as all my Ones and Onlies so far had either been forbidden to take part in the ME fun or granted the right to mega-evolve only after the credits rolled; but now, nothing stood between me and that ultimate evolution stage. I chose Absol as my first lone ranger with ME included, because a) I've been wanting to run solo with him forever, and b) his ME looks gorgeous as all hell. All it took was a bout of Ditto breeding in my X save and a quick trip to Kilourde Town to snatch the Absolite, and voilà! My newborn Absol was ready to travel to my Y cartridge, with the Absolite safely tucked wherever 'Mons keep held items, and could start wreaking havoc right away. Absol's name might as well be a shortcut for \"Absolutely Fabulous\"; because oh my, is that 'Mon dope indeed. With an Attack stat that totally goes through the roof and a great learnset covering pretty much all the bases when it comes to elemental complementarities, Absol is stellar solo run material and is hands down the best Dark 'Mon I've had the pleasure of cruising with so far. My Move pool was delightfully varied and darn efficient: Night Slash, Thunder and Psycho Cut were the main fixtures for most of my run, supplemented by Flamethrower and Ice Beam as we got closer to the Pokemon League. On top of that, I had the opportunity to experiment with Moves never handled before. The first one was Future Sight, which looked awesome on paper yet turned out to be unfit for a solo run setting and was thus promptly ditched; the second one was Me First, which I hereupon deem one of the best Normal Move ever created since the dawn of the series. Not only was it fun to use, with the surprise element of never knowing what your opponent had up their sleeve, but it was amazingly efficient as well — you'd never believe how many 'Mons wield Moves belonging to types they are weak to. I had so much fun with all these Moves that I decided to give my beloved Return a pass — all the more so as Mega Evolution could trample any type resistance anyway.Talking about this, how was my first experience with Gen VI's star feature? The answer is: pretty awesome indeed. It was incredibly satisfying to boot up my Absol's ME in the heat of battle and watch her become that unstoppable war horse; and it was even more incredibly satisfying to be able to do it over and over again. ME beautifully made up for Absol's lack of evolution, with the added bonus of getting to see my Absol evolve in such a way multiple times over the course of my run. I daresay that ME is actually too overpowered for a solo run setting, and made all things fighting a mite too smooth and easy — especially when applied to a 'Mon as strong as Absol. Of course, that absolutely won't prevent me from using the thing again if I get the opportunity — because I just love bulldozing everything that moves in my Pokemon runs, yeah baby.In a nutshell, this was an excellent run and very convincing first try at ME. Only time will tell if I dabble in it again, but I'd bet that it will be the case indeed. As for Absol, I will definitely give him the opportunity to shine as a lone ranger in his home region at some point; that may also allow me to test if solo runs with traded 'Mons are viable in Gen III under more stringent obedience level caps. Thanks for reading as usual, dear fellow gamers, and stay tuned for more Pokemon goodness!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Pearl: The Pachirisu Solo Run", "date": "11/05/2019", "text": "Here we are, going all Electric again in Sinnoh! And going all cute this time too, with the utterly adorable Pachirisu being my One and Only du jour. I love squirrels ever since I got a stuffed one as a infant, so cruising with Pachirisu was going to a delight no matter what. After polishing off the Rock Gym with Piplup — let's make this easy, because why not? — I recruited a Pachirisu next to the Valley Windworks; and since I was out of electric-themed names and squirrels are famous for their nut-hoarding ways, I decided to name my new lone ranger Nocciolata. Because hey, who doesn't love delicious italian hazelnut spread?I'll say it: Pachirisu totally blew my mind. I had a number of preconceptions regarding the Sinnoh squirrel's fighting niche, going from him being a status effect caster to him being one of those fast yet fragile Do-or-die 'Mons. The one thing I never, ever expected him to be — nor any Pikachu clone, for that matter — was a frigging staller. How can that cute teeny-tiny squirrel be so incredibly buff and sturdy? GameFreak nicely subverted expectations with that one, and I loved being taken by surprise — all the more so as it doesn't happen so often anymore with me being the Pokemon solo run veteran I am. The number of hits Pachirisu can swallow without breaking a sweat is properly astounding; my lovely Nocciolata didn't faint a single time, and I can count on the fingers on one hand the number of times he was down to the last quarter of his HP bar. Heck, Ground Moves themselves never took away more than half of said HP bar! Earthquake? Please b*tch, you couldn't one-shoot me even if you had the manual. Needless to say, my peace of mind on the battlefield was utterly ensured with such a hardy 'Mon: I could do my thing unhindered, confident that my little Nocciolata would survive pretty much any assault.Pachirisu's defensive pizzazz nicely compensates for his slightly lacklustre offensive prowess. With an Attack and Sp.Attack of 45, the Sinnoh squirrel kinda lacks punch; and unlike other weak 'Mons out there, he cannot rely on some evolution down the line to rev up his fighting oomph. On top of that, my Nocciolata's Attack was actually lower than his Sp.Attack, despite him boasting a Docile nature that should have left his base stats unchanged — puzzling, to say the least. This led to an insanely irritating situation that I don't remember having ever encountered before in a solo run, with my Pachirisu being able to empty foes' HP bars nearly entirely — yet not quite completely. I lost count of the number of times the opponent was left with literally one pixel of HP, forcing me to waste a precious move and making the fight last longer than it should. I never knew what I could expect from a hit, and if a turn was going to be the last or not.Pachirisu's default learnset is pretty similar to Luxray's one, with Spark (later discarded in favour of TM Shock Wave by yours truly) and Discharge as his Electric Moves of choice. However, he has to make do with Normal only when it comes to other Types, which could easily have led to a sorry retread of my Pikachu solo run of Yellow. Fortunately, my little squirrel had an ace in the hole: TM Grass Knot, a.k.a. the best way to wipe a battlefield clean in Sinnoh and virtually erase Pachirisu's one and only Type weakness. It never dawned on me before how abundant Rock, Ground and Water 'Mons are in Sinnoh — but I'm very aware of it now indeed. Ironically enough, I was in no hurry to learn the move at first, and only did so because I didn't want to be stuck with Normal and Electric Moves; and boy, didn't I regret it afterwards! Grass Knot's usefulness only grew over time, and I cannot even begin to explain how much of a death sentence it proved for Ground or Rock 'Mons that were also heavy. Which, incidentally, is nearly always the case. In a nutshell: I spent pretty much 80% of my run spamming Grass Knot, Return, Shock Wave and Discharge, but didn't even suffer from it thanks to how versatile and efficient those Moves were. This goes to show that when it comes to Move pools, performance matters more than variety indeed.I'm done with my Pachirisu run of Pearl, and let me tell you: I'm also done with Pearl as a whole, and with Diamond as well. That pair is just the slowest of the slow when it comes to pacing, and I cannot bear the thought of enduring any more runs of them. From now on, I'm gonna stick to Platinum when it comes to all things Sinnoh: it's faster, prettier and overall much more enjoyable. Thanks for following my solo run Pokemon adventures, dear fellow gamers; there's more coming soon, so stay tuned!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Diamond: The Luxray Solo Run", "date": "05/05/2019", "text": "I declare the Pokemon Summer Season 2019 open! Granted, it's a bit early; but getting a quick taste of Valkyrie Drive Bhikkhuni made me realize that what I really wanted was some easy grinding, preferably in a relaxing and mellow game world. And what better series to fit that bill than Pokemon? None, indeed! Follow me now for yet another entry in my ever-growing list of fulfilled — and fulfilling — Pokemon solo runs, dear fellow gamers! I'm now back to the game that started it all for me when it comes to all things Pokemon: Pokemon Diamond, i.e. my First Ever Pokemon Entry. Although I have the fondest memories of that game, I've not touched it since my first and only playthrough in 2014; as a matter of fact, I've played the whole jewellery trilogy surprisingly little given how crucially important it was for the genesis of my love for the Pokemon franchise, with only four runs under my belt between Platinum, Diamond and Pearl. And it's not like the Sinnoh region lacks viable solo runs material, oooh no precious; heck, there are some 'Mons out there I've been itching to run solo with for years. As one of the two Sinnoh regional cats, Luxray is obviously such a 'Mon — although to be fair, I've already cruised with the electric lynx, along with his fellow Purugly; but that duo run was never completed and thus got lost in the sands of time. I'm now back at it, and for good this time. No more interlopers — here's a pure Luxray solo run for you, dear fellow gamers!Luxray is special in many regards. For once, he's one of these 'Mons that solely roams his home region and can hardly be found in the wild beyond the game that introduced him. For another, he's one of only a handful of Electric 'Mons introduced in Gen IV, and one of the precious few that boasts pure Electric Type. Last but not least, his looks and Move Pool are weirdly at odds with said pure Electric Type. Not only does Luxray don a gorgeous graphite fur coat as he evolves, but he can also learn two powerful Dark Moves along the way, namely Bite and Crunch; with such attributes, one may expect the Sinnoh lynx to boast a double Electric/Dark Type — only to be thoroughly surprised when Luxray turns out to be pure Electric. There's been some speculation about Luxray being originally intended as a dual Electric/Dark 'Mon, before GameFreak changed him to a pure Electric Type for reasons known to them only; but no matter where the truth lies, I'm rather happy with Luxray's actual Type. Not being Dark means that he only has Ground 'Mons to worry about; and with his offensive stats being quite excellent, he can wreak havoc on the battlefield with his Dark Moves even without the benefit of the STAB. I actually made my Luxray a faux-Dark/Electric 'Mon by slapping the Dread Plate on him early on — not quite good as the STAB, granted, but pretty much the next best thing, especially when there are no Type weaknesses involved.I'll tactfully describe Luxray's Move Pool as not exactly optimized. The electric lynx can learn only three Electric Moves by levelling up, and those Moves are weirdly chosen to say the least. Luxray first learns Spark at lv.13, a physical Move with 65 power, 20 PP and 100% accuracy — pretty good, especially for a Move learnt so early. Then, a whole 22 levels later at lv.35, Luxray learns Thunder Fang: a physical Move with 65 power, 95% accuracy and 15 PP. Pray tell, why on earth would I replace Spark with Thunder Wave, when the latter is less efficient than the former? And then comes the ultimate trolling, when Luxray finally learns the very last Move of his levelling-up learnset at lv.56: Discharge, a bloody special Move. So you're telling me that I waited so long, only to be handed a Move that doesn't make the most of Luxray's highest offensive stat, i.e. his Attack? And mind you, I was running solo and thus was pretty much bound to reach lv.56 no matter what; but I feel for all the players who leveled up the Sinnoh lynx — which has a medium slow levelling-up rate, en passant — only to be slapped in the face with such an ineffective Move pool. TMs could have saved the day for Luxray; but unfortunately, all the Electric Moves he can learn on that front are special Moves as well. On the other hand, his Dark and Normal Moves are all physical; knowing that, what do you think my Move pool ended up being? Heck, you guessed it: Spark, Bite, Crunch and Return. Way to go and destroy Luxray's potential, GameFreak! Heck, no wonder the poor thing has been vegetating in the depths of the NU and PU tiers ever since his arrival.When it comes to Diamond and Sinnoh itself, our reunion was not exactly emotional. I was shocked by how graphically primitive Diamond is, especially compared to the lush Gen III: it's like GameFreak forgot how to create textures between Gen III and Gen IV — or, more likely, they couldn't wrap their head around the DS and didn't manage to make the most of its graphical capabilities. Diamond&Pearl's graphical crudity could have been a tad alleviated, had Sinnoh itself boasted more variety in terms of landscapes and vistas; but alas, we're dealing with a dreadfully homogeneous region that sports the same sickly green grass and trees from beginning to end. As a matter of fact, the whole Diamond&Pearl colour palette is a bit off, which doesn't help their case at all. Nor does the indolent pacing, which contrasts violently with Gen III's overall swiftness: everything in D&P is slow and sluggish, from battling to surfing to looking for items — and don't even get me started on the marshes and the snow. It certainly doesn't help that wild areas between towns are so darn huge and take so long to be crossed — a fact not quite compensated by the lenient random encounter rate, which is probably the lowest in the whole series. I rushed through Sinnoh from beginning to end, not ever dilly-dallying along the way; and yet, my run clocked at 15 long, plodding hours.Despite those letdowns, my Luxray solo run was great fun. I'm glad I could put the electric lynx to the test at long last, and I'm planning to do the same with the other pure Electric Sinnoh 'Mon, i.e. the adorable Pachirisu. Stay tuned for more electrifying Gen IV adventures, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading as usual, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Valkyrie Drive - Bhikkhuni: Not what I wanted, but just what I needed", "date": "30/04/2019", "text": "Or maybe the opposite, actually. Here's the story in a nutshell: I wanted to play something, but I couldn't decide what, because my ever-reliable gaming instinct seemingly decided to go on holiday out of the blue. To shake myself out of that rut, I decided to blindly pick up a game in my precious collection and dive senselessly into it — whatever 'it' happened to be. You already know which game was the lucky winner, dear fellow gamers; and let's be honest, I was actually a tad crestfallen when I saw what I had unearthed. Cuz even if I didn't know what I wanted to play, I sure knew that I didn't especially want to play a Beat'em Up. The thing is, I feel the need to play Beat'em Ups like, once in a blue moon; the genre is getting harder and harder on my fingers with age, and a quick fix is usually enough to satisfy whatever beating cravings I may harbour for a very long time. As it is, I played a rerun of Streets of Rage with my sister last Christmas, which should definitely have been enough to sate my appetite for punching until next Christmas. I was certainly not in the mood to play another Beat'em Up so soon; however, I had pledged myself to play whichever game I'd pick up, and that was the game the Universe threw in my probing hands. There was no choice but to relent and dive head first into that peachy — in more ways than one — punching fest.Three hours later, I regret nothing. I kinda didn't want to play a Beat'em Up, and I still kinda don't want it; but heck, that game is awesome! See, I'm not really the most sophisticated Beat'em Up player out there, dear fellow gamers. When I indulge in the genre, I'm not looking for flashy animations, gorgeous graphics, charismatic characters or uber-fancy combos; the only thing I'm asking for are kickass, stellar physics. I want to feel the weight of my punches, and I want to see my adversaries feel it too. I want impact noises, groans of pain and recoil; I want to feel the sheer physicality of the fight, in my fingers as well as in my gamer's soul. And of course, I want to have full control over the whole thing: the MC must be a total extension of my fingertips, ready to pounce at the tiniest of my inputs. And lucky me, VDB delivered all that in spades! It took me a mere ten seconds to get hold of my character and slide into the groove of battle; and then I was on a roll, punching every living thing into oblivion and jumping, dashing and gliding all around like I owned the place.And the goodness doesn't stop there, because VDB also offers all of those things I'm not actually looking for in a Beat'em Up! Okay, maybe not all of them. Charismatic characters are unfortunately nowhere to be found here: the girls are cute and lovely, but they all feel a bit vanilla and lack the distinctive flavours and overall zaniness sported by, say, the Senran Kagura roster. The graphics are easy on the eye, with bright colours and lovely vistas; but they're not nearly unique enough to set the game apart from the army of fan-servicey games starring buxom 3D vixens out there. On the other hand, the sparkly, fancy animations are a constant feast for the retinas; and the combos... Oh dear, the combos! This is a really deep and intricate fighting system we're dealing with here, with tons of complex techniques and combinations to pull off. Heck, the fighting tutorial alone lasts a good half-hour, and it's packed with an insanely high number of moves. I'll be honest: I've already forgotten half of those moves, because of my utter lack of sophistication in all things Beat'em Up. But the beauty of it all is that I don't actually need to master all these insanely subtle tricks, because the game also totally accommodates much simpler and barer fighting styles such as mine. Now that's the mark of a truly excellent Beat'em Up: to let you punch it your way, be it with two buttons or with twelve.So, I totally love VDB; but still, I can't promise I'll finish it in one go. Heck, I can't even promise I'll pick it up again once I'm done writing that post; I feel like this three-hour session has sated all my Beat'em Up cravings — cravings I didn't even have in the first place. But no matter what happens now, I know that VDB is a darn good game, and I know that it stands at the ready to satisfy any punching urge I may harbour in the future. See you later — or not — for more fighting tidings, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, thanks for reading, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Octopath Traveler: Final thoughts (for the time being)", "date": "26/04/2019", "text": "Let's face it: although my Switch is no longer around, I still want to play OT. Very much so, actually. Not only that, but I'd love to have this game in my collection, treasure it and replay it at will. That won't happen any time soon, unfortunately: OT is a Switch exclusive, and since I have neither a Switch (anymore) nor the intention to collect for it (ever), I'll have to make do with my warm memories of that game — and maybe a second run in a couple of years, when I get my paws on a second-hand Switch for game library exploration purposes.We're actually touching OT's main issue in my opinion: namely, the fact that this game somehow feel too small, too homely for the Switch. I cannot shake that feeling that Squeenix' choral offering should have been developed for the 3DS and the Vita first and foremost and released on those systems. (The Vita and its cinematic screen in particular would have been a perfect home for OT.) This game feels like a portable RPG at heart; not just a portable RPG, but a portable RPG that should have unfolded on a small screen, in the intimate cosyness of one's own two hands. Of course, maybe that's just the handheld aficionado in me speaking; however, I cannot help that a bit of OT's magic was scattered and irremediably lost on the Switch's mammoth screen.Anyway, a 3DS/Vita port of OT won't be happening any time soon; so I might as well focus on my brief, fleeting experience with it on the Switch. Although 'brief' and 'fleeting' may not be the most appropriate terms, given that I spent a hefty 50 hours roaming Orsterra. And my, what a fine 50 hours those were! Apart from the rocky early stages and the mild tendinitis case, my run was pure pleasure from start to finish. I was about to finish the third round of chapters when I bid my Switch adieu, and RPG fatigue was still nowhere in sight; I'm pretty sure I could have racked up 20 more hours without breaking a sweat and with tons of enjoyment. Oh well; we'll do that next time, won't we?I was initially planning to wrap up my OT ramblings with a good ol' Pros and cons list; but now, a couple of days after selling my Switch, I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about that gem of a game and my delightful run of it. I just love everything about OT, and it left me with plenty of sweet, fluffy, heartwarming memories. Oh, the glittering snow in Flamegrace! Oh, those perfect fights where I Broke the opposition in one swift, neat turn! Oh, the outstanding alchemy of my Fab Three! It really pains me to think that I cannot get my greedy collecting paws on OT; but I guess it will only make my memories of it more precious. And with that, dear fellow gamers, my OT odyssey comes to an end — for the time being. Will I ever come back to that great game, only time will tell; but as I'm writing this, I'd love nothing more indeed. Thanks a million for reading as usual, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Nintendo Switch: See you around", "date": "20/04/2019", "text": "It's official, dear fellow gamers: my Switch days are over. I just sold my Switch on an impulse, which is beautifully ironic given that this was an impulse purchase to start with — we've come full circle, so to speak.As for the reasons behind that most unexpected move, they are aplenty. There's the fact that I hardly touched my Switch in the last year, which made me think that I wouldn't miss the thing too much indeed. Also, I cannot deny that I was in serious danger of being overwhelmed: it seems that I can safely deal with five consoles, but six consoles is one too much. Well, at least I know my collecting limits now, don't I? I'm sure my bank account will appreciate the respite, oh yes precious.Not only that, but the more I play the Switch, the more my aversion for it grows. I dislike the Switch's weight, its size, its shape, the very feel of it in my hands. No matter how hard I try to convince myself that I'm dealing with a portable console, that darn piece of kit fails to give me that snuggly, cosy and intimate vibe I get from my other (genuine) handhelds. To make matters worse, my Octopath Traveler sessions left me with a mild case of tendinitis that I'm currently trying to recover from, and my right hand just cannot take anymore the heat that routinely flows from the right side of the system.  With my Switch gone, my OT playthrough comes to an abrupt end; I apologize if you were waiting eagerly for my run reports, dear fellow gamers. (There will be a final post about the game, I promise). This also means no Pokemon Sword & Shield for me, nor any of the games I had my eye on — at least, not for the time being. I've reverted to my original plan, i.e. to wait a couple of years — and hopefully a lighter, smaller model — before purchasing a second-hand Switch and making a rampage through its library.So, I'm back to my beloved last generation handhelds, and my little blog is about to become a retro gaming haven. I'm glad and a tad relieved, I must admit; I've always been a retro gamer at heart, and there's something strangely relaxing and comfortable in taking a step back and watching the gaming industry's evolution from the sidelines. Thanks for dropping as usual, dear fellow gamers; and see you soon for more exciting retro handheld tidings!"},
{"title": "Octopath Traveler: Meet the crew", "date": "16/04/2019", "text": "Here we are, dear fellow gamers: my own personal ranking of OT's eight characters, from my least favourite to my uttermost favourite — because we want to keep le meilleur pour la fin, don't we? I'll judge them based on their personalities (if such a word can be used to describe bunches of pixels), stories and, last but not least, on their class and abilities — because heck, we're role-playing here after all. Without further ado, let's get down to it!H'aanit: I fully expected to adore OT's fierce huntress, I really did; and yet there she stands, at the bottom of my personal ranking. So what went wrong, pray tell? I wish I could claim that her voice and dialogue get on my nerve; but alas, her stiff middle english is the least of my concerns. I'm much more aggravated by her atrocious aiming, which sees her miss half of her hits as a rule and makes her multi-targeting abilities utterly pointless. So you're supposed to be a top-tier huntress, and yet you cannot fire a bow without missing? I wanted Robin Hood and I got Baby's First Archery Lesson — thanks for nothing, Squeenix. And my, are her Pokemon-ish abilities way too complicated and unwieldy for my taste: nearly all foes are Legendaries to her, and the only creatures she can capture with any degree of certainty are weaklings that are good for little to nothing on the battlefield. Granted, her passive skills are awesome; but alas, it's not enough to make me dig her battle prowess. Primrose: Let's be clear: I don't actually dislike Primrose. In fact, there are plenty of things I like about her, from the sheer grimness of her own personal tale to her husky, low-pitched voice. But alas, the RPG player in me simply cannot be satisfied with her near-uselessness in battle and on the field. Not only is she painfully weak on both physical and elemental fronts, making her exclusive mastery of Dark kinda pointless, but she has the nerve of wielding a mere single weapon, making her virtually useless as far as weapon coverage go. Her Action Path is bound to come in handy only a measly couple of times over a full run, and her Talent... Heck, what's her Talent, already? Oh yeah, summoning NPCs in battle. Like Tressa, basically — only more tedious, because Prim has to charm those NPCs first. Sure, she has good buffing abilities; but serial buffing has never been my playing style, and thus I have little to no use for Primrose in my party setting.Olberic: I'm usually a sucker for the brave ole Warrior in RPGs, and I love myself a good story of honour, bravery and knighthood. That should have made Olberic a surefire hit; but if you read my first post about OT, you know already that it's not the case. His voice and signature lines grate on my ears, his bulky and poorly dressed sprite stings my retinas and, last but not least, his fighting abilities leave me cold. Sure, he's strong as all heck, and he boasts a couple of neat and deadly moves; but that is definitely not enough to make him a true battle asset. Being the only character wielding no elemental skill at all doesn't do him any favour, and I cannot help but think that he should have been a bit more powerful on the physical front to compensate for that absence. He should also have been more notably sturdy to function properly as the tank he's supposed to be.Therion: I like and despise the resident thief, all at once and in turn. I love him to pieces when I trot down the streets, swiftly getting my paws on NPCs' possessions as I go. I bow to his awesomeness when I'm unleashing his devastating Divine Skill on the battlefield. I delight in his tale of broken trust and wandering and his lone wolf quality during the story segments. But oh gosh, do I want to slap him hard every time he opens his crude mouth — and never more than when he spits \"Come on, I've got better things to do\" or \"Where's the nearest tavern\" with that cocky accent of his. And never, ever do I despise him more intensely than when I roam a dungeon and encounter yet another bloody safe that he alone can break open. I truly hate how Squeenix tried to make him indispensable by peppering the whole darn game with those cursed safes, and I now feel a pang of anger every time I spot a flash of purple around IRL.Alfyn: We're reaching the upper half of my ranking, and thus the characters I really want to stick with — and very much do stick with, actually. Alfyn's Apothecary talents are a mite too random for me, and I've never managed to craft any remotely useful — let alone outstanding — salve on the fly; on the other hand, I'm totally sold on his strength and his mastery of the axe. It certainly doesn't hurt either that he's the only character with innate status effect healing abilities, and that his Divine Skill gives him access to the only instance of status effect multi-healing. I'm also quite fond of his Inquiring talents, which are more pleasantly diplomatic than Cyrus' Scrutinizing ones and allow me to get my paws on hidden items, discounts, new gear and other niceties. Cherry on the cake, his shonen-ish personal pursuit of mastery of his craft really resonates with me, and his mountainous, pine-studded homeland completely stole my heart.Ophilia: Aaah, dear Ophilia. How I love your prime and proper demeanour, your quiet and unassuming badassery, the crystalline snowy lands your hail from. But as enticing as all this is, it certainly wouldn't be have been enough to grant you the third spot in my ranking. You gained said third spot because of how utterly indispensable you are on the battlefield. You're a natural born Healer, and a stellar one at that. Even the meanest of your healing spells can put a full party back on their feet, and you saved the day and my arse in battle more often than I care to count. That would already be more than enough to make you awesome; but you also reign alone over Light skills and you wield a Divine Skill tailor-made for boss fights, and that makes you even more impossibly awesome. You're the holy RPG party member par excellence, and even your useful-once-in-a-blue-moon Path Action cannot tarnish your light.Cyrus: I'll be honest: I have a near-tie between the resident scholar and Tressa. Cyrus didn't impress me much at first, I must say; but it wasn't long before I learnt to appreciate his talents and became truly infatuated with him. He can Break foes and wipe the battlefield clean like no other OT character with his double-hit elemental skills, and his Divine Skill can wreak havoc on bosses' HP bars — add Ophilia's Divine Skill on top, and you get a true warhorse and a harbinger of doom for everything standing on the wrong side of the battlefield. His ridiculously stylish sprite and deliciously snobbish tone and signature lines make him even more endearing to me; and I'm not even talking about his cluelessness in romantic matters, his insatiable curiosity and his ability to get lost in nerdy conversations — all things I can totally and completely relate to. Cyrus Albright, you're the sh*t.Tressa: All hail my MC and absolute favourite OT character! Heck, I've not encountered such an endearing and irresistible riches-obsessed character since I became a diehard fan of Scrooge McDuck as a kid. Funnily enough, I expected to somewhat dislike her before playing the game; and oh boy, how utterly wrong I was. I adore everything about her, from her cheeky demeanour to her saucy signature quips, from her kickass Action Path to her dope Talent, from her simple-yet-charming story to her stellar battle prowess. She's the most delightfully versatile OT character, both on the battlefield and out of it: strong physical hits, elemental skills, self-healing, stealing, buffing, filling in the coffers — she can do it all, and she can do it like a boss. Heck, she's the sole reason my party is currently swimming in money and able to pimp themselves with the very best gear available. She literally saved my run, and I definitely wouldn't love OT as much if she weren't around. Tressa Colzione, you're my spirit animal.There you have it, dear fellow gamers: my very own personal ranking of the OT cast. This is a pleasantly diverse crew, and I can safely claim that there is not a single rotten apple to find here: I like them all to various degree, and I'm interested in all of their stories — if only remotely. Feel free to share your own ranking in the comments; and as usual, thanks a lot for stopping by!"},
{"title": "Collecting: The state of affairs", "date": "12/04/2019", "text": "As the Vita and 3DS are inexorably inching towards retirement, I'm about to enter a new phase in my collector's life; a more relaxed, less extravagant phase, where gaming purchases will become the happy exception rather than the overindulgent norm. It's thus the perfect time to take stock of my collecting achievements and assess whatever unfinished business I may have in that department. DS: Aaah, DS dear, how I love you. That awesome piece of kit is the first handheld I started collecting for; it should thus make perfect sense that my DS library is the largest of all my game libraries, with a massive 156 games so far. I scoured every corner of the DS RPG pool, and I can safely claim that I own a good 95% of all DS RPGs released on our shores, if not more. There is still some potential for growth, though: I could complete my DS RPG library by snatching a couple of obscure RPGs I've not bothered with until now, such as Glory of Heracles. Also, several franchise with numerous DS entries remained unexplored by yours truly, such as Harvest Moon, Inazuma Eleven, Style Boutique or Lost in Blue. I own an instalment of each of these franchises; and should I happen to love said instalment, it could lead to late purchasing sprees. PSP: The second handheld I started collecting for, and one I love no less than the DS. Despite boasting a hefty 109 games, my PSP collection is actually the most incomplete of all my game libraries, so to speak. There are still a good number of PSP RPGs out there, Japanese as well as localized, that might be worth a purchase. Titles like the Tales of the World sequels, Airou Village, Sol Trigger and Mimana: Iyar Chronicles have gone on and off my PSP Wish List for years, and they may well join the fray in the end. Still, I'm quite proud of my PSP library: not only is it nearly entirely comprised of RPGs, but it also hits the pitch-perfect size in my book — neither trivially small nor overwhelmingly large.3DS: With 70 games, my 3DS library is my third smallest game library; yet it's also the most diverse, with games belonging to a wide array of genres — from Beat 'em ups à la Senran Kagura to Rhythm games à la Hatsune Miku: Project Mirai DX, without forgetting (perish the thought!) good ol' RPGs. That relatively limited library still required huge investments, as I went to the trouble of purchasing Japanese and North-American 3DS models in order to enjoy all the system had to offer. Apart from the few 2019 Western releases on the horizon, I can safely say that any future 3DS purchase will most likely target Japanese-only titles. Not that I have any such game on my radar right now, mind you; this is all purely hypothetical, which makes me think that my 3DS library might be very close to completion indeed.Vita: This is a collection that truly took a life of its own: started as a mere afterthough, it wound up being one of my most glorious RPG pools, with 113 games and counting. It's also without a doubt my nichest collection, with fan-servicey and budget RPGs aplenty. Of all my game libraries, this is undoubtedly the one whose overall value has the most potential to skyrocket over time, as the Vita goes from the ugly duckling of the handheld scene to legacy piece of kit. Not only are most of my regular Vita RPGs fairly rare to begin with, but I ramped up the Collector's Item factor by purchasing a couple of Limited Run Games exclusives — think 2000-3000 copies available worldwide. (Heck, those games alone could be worth my my whole Vita collection's initial price in 20 years for all I know!) Although it's fairly replete, my Vita library still have some potential for growth: apart for the few Vita games slated for release in 2019 on our shores, the Japanese front remains wide open. And given how Japanese gamers love their Vitas, I'd bet that my Vita collecting endeavours won't be over any time soon.GBA/Game Boy: I'm lumping those two together, as I play them on the same machine. With 36 and 16 cartridges respectively, my GBA and Game Boy libraries are the least impressive of all my game libraries, both in terms of sheer number of games and scope of said games. That's not to say that they don't boast mighty fine RPGs that have become cult classics over time, though. This is especially true of the GBA side, which features luminaries such as Pokemon, Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy and Breath of Fire. The Game Boy side is more modest, and focus more on little Proust madeleines of mine such as Ducktales, Link's Awakening and Kirby's Dream Land — with the occasional late RPG discovery à la Final Fantasy Legend II. I deem those two libraries pretty much complete, although you can never rule out a future addition: little hidden gems such as Warlocked and Survival Kids are darn tantalizing, and I may well cave in and snatch them in the end.After six-or-so years of intensive game hunting, I've also come to reassess some aspects of my collecting. Things have changed an awful lot in those six years, and developments that were unthinkable a couple of years ago have now become perfectly viable options — both in my collecting and in my life in general. Which leads us to the following musings:— Should I start selling some of my games? Although each and every game in my collection has a unique story behind it and is tied to heart-warming memories, there's no denying that some games are a tad less precious to me than others. A typical example of this would be Luminous Arc: whilst I genuinely enjoyed my run of it, I can't really imagine touching it ever again now that the deed is done. Wouldn't it be better, then, to let another collector get their paws on it? I have to admit that those impulses to sell average games are getting stronger by the year: why hold onto such games, when there are so many games I'm madly in love with and want to replay over and over again? Why not just stick with the crème de la crème?— Should I get rid of the boxes and manuals and hold onto cartridges/ discs only? I wouldn't have dreamt of such a move a mere two years ago, as I was too afraid of missing valuable gameplay information if I let go of booklets; however, I warmed up to the idea after realizing that most games from the last two consoles generations offer in-game tutorials — not to mention that my GBA/Game Boy collections solely comprise cartridges, and I'm fine with that. Still, this remains a huge bone of contention between the hoardy, collecting-hungry side of me and the practical, non-nonsense one. My inner collector fully realizes that my collection could instantly lose a good two-third of its value if I ditched boxes and manuals; yet my inner Marie Kondo already grumbles at the thought of needing to carry all that plastic around if I move somewhere else. Ironically enough, keeping only cartridges could be seen as an act of true faith in my gaming future, as it would imply that I don't ever plan to sell my precious collection — or would it? I could sure still sell it, only at a much lower price. Or maybe not: as years roll by, collectors would probably warm up to the idea of purchasing cartridges alone, like they did for '80s and early '90s consoles. Or would they? After all, many collectors make do with cartridges because boxes were so crappy at the time. But then again, doesn't the largest price gap lie between new and second-hand games, rather than between complete and cartridge-only games? Aaah, this is such a pain! To throw or not to throw, that is the (torturous) question. And with that, this round-up of my collection endeavours is pretty much done. Only time will tell how my precious collection evolves from there. Will it keep inflating, or deflate a bit? Will I keep some games complete and other as cartridges only? I'll just let my gaming instinct run the show, as always. A million thanks for reading as usual, dear fellow gamers, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Octopath Traveler: The most epic fighting fest of them all", "date": "08/04/2019", "text": "An awful lot has been said about OT's unsatisfying narrative structure, about the clumsiness of its disjointed storytelling, about the asinine quality of its writing. And, well, most of it is true: this is poor storytelling we're dealing with indeed, and OT couldn't hold a candle to its forebearers of Square and Enix fame even if its life depended on it. But on the other hand, I daresay that it needn't hold a candle to said forebearers in the narrative department, because it crushes them down when it comes to all things fighting. Let's face it: OT's tentacular story is nothing more than a pretense, a multipronged excuse to move your party around — and engage in thousands of battles along the way. At its core, this game is all about the fighting — nothing but the fighting. And boy, does it excel at it indeed. OT simply boasts one of the best turn-based fighting systems I've ever had the pleasure of handling, a system blessed with a depth I could never, ever have suspected when I started playing. It takes a long time to reveal its full potential — maybe a mite too long, actually; but if you can soldier on until said potential unfolds, you're in for a real treat.I'll admit it: I intensely disliked OT's fighting system at first. This is a pretty grindy game we're dealing with; and as far as my RPG expectations and experience are concerned, grindy games should go together with swift, easy, promptly-polished-up random encounters. Which, oh dear, is so not the case in OT. This is a game that makes you go all out and pull out the stops in every single battle. Forget about spamming regular attacks and mashing the A button to win: you'll need to think, strategize and, last but not least, use skills like it's going out of fashion. Forget about brute-forcing your way through with sheer overleveling: foes will remain a menace and a challenge even when crawling fifteen levels below you. That's a very good thing, of course; but I certainly didn't see it that way at first. Heck, I didn't fancy at all being forced to give my full attention to every battle; I nearly took it as a personal insult, and an undue attack on my precious time. How dared that game make me toil on trash mobs like they were the local boss, darn it? Also, thrifty little me balked at the thought of using SP-consuming skills during random encounters, after a whole lifetime spent saving such resources for boss fights. I very nearly quit right after recruiting my fourth character, when a particularly buffed-up bunch of trash mobs wiped the floor with my poor party. This is it, I thought; that's not what I signed for, count me out. Of course, I didn't sign out, as you know already; I soldiered on, and soon learnt to make the most of OT's fighting system. I learnt to use the Break system to my advantage, swiftly and neatly erasing foes' turns to give myself more leeway and opportunities to strike. I learnt to spend my SP wisely, using fitting weapons and single-hit skills to Break the opposition first and then pummeling my defenseless foes to death with multi-hit skills. I learnt to study my opponents carefully instead of going straight for the attack command, and I discovered the giddy joy of Breaking a round of foes in one turn through the thought-out use of weapons and skills. I learnt to make the most of the characters' natural complementarities, and to supplement them neatly with added ones through the clever use of Secondary Jobs. I learnt all that and more, and I enjoyed myself tremendously doing so. And then it dawned on me that OT's fighting system is truly the stuff role-playing dreams are made off, with its heavy emphasis on character complementarity and pitch-perfect use of weapons and skills. That game elevates combat to an art form, daring you to wipe the battlefield clean in the most efficient and elegant way with every single battle. I've been certainly doing my fair share of that in the last hours, especially since I started dabbling in Secondary Jobs. I made Tressa a Thief, Cyrus an Apothecary and Ophilia a Scholar, getting nearly full weapon and elemental coverage in the process; the only attack type I'm still missing is Dark, but I can make do without it. My calculations led me to the conclusion that there is simply no way to get full weapon and elemental coverage with three party members, no matter how you arrange Secondary Jobs. The game was obviously designed with a party of four in mind — a party of four whose members are switched on a regular basis to boot. I could totally ride fighting complementarities much more than I currently do and design a tailor-made team for every single area through job-switching; but I'm not sure I'll ever have the courage to do that, all the less so as I've grown quite attached to my Trio of Awesomeness already. On top of that, they are ridiculously oveleveled compared to the rest of the crew, which doesn't make for slick fighting dynamics; smoothing out those unbalances would require level-grinding, and I'd rather eat my Switch than level-grind in OT. Guess I made my bed by stubbornly sticking to the same three characters, and now I'll have to lie in it — which I do kinda joyfully, given how much I love said three characters. But more on that very soon. Here ends my ode to OT''s sheer brilliance and awesomeness in all things fighting, dear fellow gamers. I'll see you soon with more tidings from Orsterra; I'm nowhere near done with that game indeed, oh no precious. Thanks a million for reading as usual, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "RPG Wisdom", "date": "02/04/2019", "text": "I've never been one to vehemently defend my passion for gaming, claiming that it helps keep the brain active and trained, that it's a great way to make friends or that it's a piece of culture waiting to be fully acknowledged. As a lone gamer who started performing the deed in the early '90s when consoles were mere disposable toys, I smile somewhat mockingly at the last two assumptions; as for the first one, while I actually deem it fully valid, this is not something I would ever bandy around to justify my gaming habits. Not that I really need to, mind you: most of the time, I just follow my merry gaming way in the shadows, dodging nosy questions and avoiding justifications of any sort. But I digress, dear fellow gamers: what I wanted to say is that while I don't go around making lofty claims about gaming's supposed merits, I still got pretty nifty life lessons out of it — without ever really wanting to or trying, which makes the process even more glorious. The Holy Realm of RPG in particular has been exceedingly prodigal with teachings, showing me through telltale examples the wholesomeness of a number of virtues.Diligence and Patience: Let's roll all the way back to 2012: I had just started my solo run of Dragon Quest IX, and I was poring over forums to garner useful tips. That's where I learnt about King Metal Slimes, those near-mythical creatures that could grant you XP by the truckload and lounged deep in post-games dungeons. Having barely cleared the first dungeon at the time, I despaired of ever reaching such impossibly powerful beasts; and yet, 150 hours later, I was roaming Grottos and one-shooting those silvery royals like it was going out of fashion. That particular case taught me in the most striking way that no matter how lofty and unreachable a goal seems at first sight, it can always be achieved if one takes the necessary time to do so. Since then, countless RPGs have confirmed that defining lesson in various ways. That Lv.99 frontier that seems so faraway when the MC is a puny Lv.1? Gimme hundreds of random battles, and I'll sure get there. Those thousand square meters of dungeons that must be cleared before reaching the final boss? Gimme a few dozens of hours, and I'll sure do the deed. Endurance and Fortitude: We can all agree that RPGs are sometimes a royal pain in the arse: insanely high random encounter rates, nasty cheated bosses, fake difficulty up the wazoo, obnoxious dungeon design — you name it. I sometimes find myself disheartened by all those obstructions and despairing of ever reaching the final boss, let alone beating it; yet somehow, I always manage to do so in the end. RPG hurdles teach me time and time again me to be perseverant: if I dutifully soldier through them, I'll reach my goal eventually and succeed. I had countless masters in that department, too many to count actually; however, two of them stands out amongst others. The first is Astonishia Story, a game that made my crew weak by design and threw at me an insanely hard final boss; the second is The Legend of Legacy, a game loaded with spike difficulties and unscrutables rules. Those two made me toil like crazy; and yet, I ultimately triumphed and conquered them, learning the value of endurance and fortitude in the most satisfying and rewarding way as I did so. Thriftiness and Good Resource Management: To be fair, I was thrifty long before I started playing RPGs in earnest; however, there's no denying that the genre drove the point home in the smartest and most efficient way. Whether it be skill points or good ol' monies, resources must be managed cleverly if one wants to get by in an RPG; and saving, sparing and compromising are part and parcel of such good resource management. Should I get that skill or the other? Should I save money for that awesome piece of gear, or use my current funds to buy several inferior ones? Should I grind for currency to get everything I want, or renounce some things? Should I use my MP for one devastating attack or several small ones? And we all know about that awesome multi-healing item that begs to be saved for boss battles. All RPGs offer such dilemmas; however, Final Fantasy Legend II boasts one of the most stringent resource management out there, with its limited inventory space, limited weapon use, limited currency, limited pretty much everything; when you've survived such a giant frugality fest, you can pretty much adapt smoothly to any budget limitation IRL.Adaptability and resiliency: We all know about that Wake-up Call Boss; the one that made our best-honed strategies null and void in a matter of turns and send us scurrying away in shame — if it doesn't one-shoot our whole party, that is. Yet we also know that with the right combination of grinding, strategies, items, gear and luck, that seemingly impassable boss will ultimately bow to us and let us progress unhindered. I always try to remember such Wake-up Call bosses when the going gets rough and I'm tempted to give up a bit too fast in real life; and instead of doing so, I try to find a new approach and I go back at it with a vengeance, until I finally triumph. Heck, I would never ever have finished a single RPG if I ran away with my tail between my legs every time I encountered a tough nasty; and I sure won't achieve anything worthwhile if I allow myself to do so IRL. Now obviously, sometimes I still ultimately give up on arduous tasks for various reasons; but in that case, I have no regrets, because I know in my heart of hearts that I did try my hardest. Just like when I tried to complete those postgame dungeons in Shiren, Explorers of Sky and Dungeon Travelers 2 and finally gave up because the effort/reward ratio was way too skewed in favour of the former. Independence and Autonomy: Last but not least, RPGs taught me to play it my way. Whether you rely on brute force or refined strategies, whether you're a hoarder or a serial seller when it comes to inventory, whether you're all about physical attacks or elemental spells, whether you're in for the grinding or the sightseeing, the vast majority of RPGs out there will give you enough leeway to indulge in your very own penchants and fetishes — and so does life as a whole. The most glorious display of such autonomy as far as my gaming career is concerned are obviously my many Pokemon solo runs. Such runs are so at odds with the series' core concept that it hurts; yet they function beautifully nonetheless, and that alone is enough to convince me that most real-life situations can be approached from original angles and bent to my iron will.  There you have it, dear fellow gamers: the lessons I got from my favourite genre under the gaming sun, and the virtues countless RPGs taught me to cultivate. Feel free to share your own personal lessons from games in the comment section; and as usual, thanks a million for reading, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Octopath Traveler: My life as a merchant", "date": "29/03/2019", "text": "With only two full-blown games played in one year, my Switch is not exactly risking a burnout. And mind you, that second game might not even have come to pass: for indeed, my first steps with Octopath Traveler's were not exactly stellar. I went for the safe and classic choice of character and started playing with good ole warrior Olberic, only to get more and more disheartened as time went on: Olberic's battle skills were limited and boring, his Path Action was borderline useless, his Talent was hardly noticeable and, last but not least, his story left me completely cold. I just couldn't imagine handling such a lacklustre character for 60-or-more hours; I needed a trump card if I wanted to keep playing OT, and quick. That's when I decided to play each character's intro sequence, and see which one of these appetizers proved palatable enough to warrant more bites.The result of those mini trial runs pretty much stands in this post's title: all hail happy winner Tressa, a.k.a. OT's very own Torneko! Damn, that lass completely and utterly stole my heart with her high levels of sass, her cheeky battle dialogue and her story. My Landstalker days in the '90s left me with a soft spot for treasure-hunting stories, so Tressa's own personal tale of discovering the world and amassing riches while doing so was right up my alley. And pray tell, how could I resist her miraculous Path Action that lets her purchase wares from NPCs at a discount price, and her magnificent Talent that lets her find lost money lying on the ground every time she enters an area? Tressa was purely and simply made for me, that's how utterly awesome she is.Still, my run was not out of the woods yet, oooh no precious. I had the hardest time finding my stride in battle, and the sheer slowness of all things fighting was doing a serious number on my RPG morale. Why did even the meanest trash mob put up such a fight before kicking the bucket, dang it? Having HP bags as bosses is one thing, and a fully normal one as far as RPGs go; but having regular field foes boast mountains of HP was another animal entirely, and one I was not sure I wanted to humour. I also suspected the game of being guilty of level scaling, which could have constituted a surefire dealbreaker given that I despise the very existence of level scaling. The five hour-mark was a particularly tricky point that saw me very close to giving up indeed; however, I decided to soldier on a mite longer, just to be sure I was not missing out on something. This turned out to be the right decision, as things subtly improved during the next couple of hours. My strategies got better, fights got faster and, last but not least, my sneaking suspicion of level scaling was dispeled; and lo and behold, I started enjoying the game in earnest around the ten hour-mark, and my love for it has grown stronger and bolder ever since.I'm now done recruiting all eight characters and polishing off the first round of chapters for all of them, and my winning party is pretty much set. Tressa's battle prowess as my main is neatly supplemented by Cyrus' and Ophilia's; together, they make a well-assorted and formidably efficient triad. The fourth slot is reserved for the character whose story I'm currently toiling on, and I make sure I switch them on a regular basis to keep everybody evenly leveled up. I'd have Alfyn as a permanent party member if I could have my way, because he's as sturdy as heck and his battlefield-sweeping Axe abilities are just too awesome; however, since I want to polish off all eight stories and level up in the process, a compromise has to be reached. He's still definitely in my top four — but more on that later, as I'm planning to write my own personal ranking of OT's cast.I'm planning to write many more things about OT indeed, so better not overdo it for the time being. I'm going to wrap up that post by saying that although I still have reservations about a couple of things, I am, on the other hand, utterly and desperately in love with OT's aesthetics and atmosphere. That game is so deliciously quaint it hurts, and it routinely sends me into the most painfully exquisite bouts of gaming fernweh. I want to be immersed into that world, to roam those picturesque landscapes and drink in those scenic vistas until my head swoon with elation and my eyes get teary at the beauty of what I'm seeing. I thought Squeenix went overboard with the blur effect at first, but I'm used to it now and wouldn't want it any other way. I cannot wait to discover all the lovely locations OT still has in store for me — and since, I'm mentioning this, my Switch is done charging, which means that the time is ripe for a well-deserved playing session. I'll see you very soon with more OT tidings, dear fellow gamers; as usual, thanks a lot for stopping by!"},
{"title": "Code Realize - Wintertide Miracles: Wearing thin", "date": "25/03/2019", "text": "True to its wintery inspiration, Wintertide Miracles is like a snowflake: kinda sparkly and lovely, but leaving absolutely no trace whatsoever once melted. Maybe that's none too surprising: not only are we talking about a fandisc, i.e. a type of media that's a bit too close to officially sanctioned fanfiction for comfort, but we're also talking about the second Code Realize fandisc. The first was already pretty light on content and treading a mite too much on fanfiction territory; but that was nothing compared to WM, which proudly roams said territory and makes no effort to hide its sheer fanficness. I'll be blunt: the content here is so thinly spread that there's not even enough material to write a decent route report, forcing me to resort instead to a good ol' Pros and Cons List. (Spoilers ahead!)THE BAD: Going all Legend of Zelda: WM proudly cements the existence of two distinct timelines in the Code Realize lore: the original one presented in the first game, in which Finis dies, and the alternative one introduced in Future Blessings, in which Finis survives. The game weaves these two timelines in a clumsy and unfulfilling fashion, leaving us with two somewhat weak stories instead of a single solid one — and a sour taste of fanfiction in the mouth. Amateur storytelling aside, the very existence of that second timeline basically means that I was totally not the only one who was miffed to see Finis die in the original story, which begs the question: why was Finis not saved in said original story to start with? His relationship with Cardia could have been explored in the fandiscs all the same, and that would have spared us that utterly inelegant recourse to an alternative timeline. We could then have enjoyed the better of two worlds, instead of having to choose between bro and beaus.Christmas food, yes please!Cardia's Too Good: Even though Cardia is bound to have all the beaus fawning over her simply by virtue of being an otome heroine, and even though she does deserve the attention by virtue of being an interesting otome heroine, there can indeed be too much of a good thing. The original gameand Future Blessings made sure that only one guy at a time was in love with Cardia, while the others rooted for the lovebirds from the sidelines; WM, on the other hand, goes harem full force with its Double Date feature, which stars two beaus simultaneously trying to gain Cardia's favours. Not only does this call forth mental images of the hentai variety, but it's also over-the-top and tacky. Most of us struggle to gain the love of one decent person, yet Cardia has a whole posse of handsome and honorable men at her feet? Heck, this hits a little too far from home for comfort. Cardia comes across as stiff and unconfortable in those segments, and it doesn't help that she has to friendzone like her life depends on it; the whole thing makes her less relatable and likeable, and that's quite unfortunate.  Still a sexy b*tch, though. Victor's Assassination: To my utter horror, my favourite romance material in CR is getting more defiled by the fandisc. After having suffered through an unfulfilling sequel route that basically ruined all the wholesomeness of Victor's original route, I had to endure the pain of seeing him reduced to a giant fanfic trope at the hands of WM. It's harrowing enough to see him confess his undying love for Cardia under the influence of a (eyes rolling) truth serum in one of the Double Dates; however, the torture doesn't stop here, as the darn game serves us a dedicated route in which Victor begs Cardia to pretend to be his fiancée to get him out of a bind. Not only is this fanfic porn at its purest, but it's not even consistent with Victor's established character. Victor was the most heart-wrenchingly, hauntingly sincere of all the beaus in the original game — not over-the-top like Impey, not ice cold like Van Helsing, not full of flourishes like Lupin, not conflicted like Saint-Germain. Why would such a beautifully honest character resort to that kind of stratageme, knowing that he could hurt himself and Cardia in the process? Heck, the Victor I know would have confessed his feelings eons before even dreaming of asking Cardia to play lovers.  Isaac Beckford For The Win: The way WM rambles on and on about Cardia's late father's contributions to science, London and England, you'd think this guy was a saint and not the original game's main villain. Trying to make him more nuanced and to show his human side is one thing; trying to rehabilitate him entirely and make us forget his horrendous deeds and devious mind is another, and the game should have wisely abstained from the latter. The number of side stories featuring a forgotten or lost Isaac Beckford contraption is also getting properly ridiculous — I swear, it's turning into a gimmick at that point. Are we dealing with an insane genius or with Inspector Gadget here? One more CR fandisc, and Isaac Beckford will probably be saving the day à la MacGyver from beyond the grave. THE GOOD:Cantarella, a.k.a. The Dark Horse: I didn't expect much from the resident \"Cardia's New BFF\" story; however, the songstress' tale took me by surprise and touched my heart. Cantarella's story succeeds better than Shirley's in showing a fulfilling father-daughter relationship that Cardia can build upon and draw inspiration from to reconcile herself with her past. In fact, I daresay that Cantarella and Miles' relationship is one of the best in the entire series. Their constant dead-pan banter is hilarious; yet behind the ribbing hides a deep and strong love, mixed with a desperate desire to protect each other and be worthy of the other's affections. Some of their scenes made me laugh, others made me tear up — but none left me indifferent, and I was left deeply sated by the unfolding of their tumultuous relationship. Finis Rules: Forget about the beaus and Cardia herself, Finis is the true star of WM. He's present in every single story, and he shines like crazy. His budding relationship with Cardia is a delight to watch, and his sharp tongue makes for deliciously hilarious dialogue. Otomate could have gone the easy way and made him a pure tsundere or an total ice queen; instead, they went for subtlety and made him exactly what he is, i.e. a formerly sheltered boy who's slowly but surely learning to love and show affection. Cardia and Finis' ever-growing bond is absolutely the best relationship in the entire series, trampling all the romantic routes in its wake. Special mention to that splendid moment in which a flustered Finis manages to say aloud that he loves Cardia — only to have emotionally tone-deaf Cardia dismiss his prowess entirely; that scene manages to be all at once incredibly moving and ridiculously funny, i.e. pretty much Cardia and Finis' relationship in a nutshell. Secondary Character Galore: Every single CR character gets their fifteen minutes of fame and screen time in WM — including such unlikely entries as Aleister, Nemo and Sisi. The Gordon Mafia trio from Future Blessings makes a couple of cameos, and so does the Idea triad. It's lovely to see the whole CR crew come together in a single game, all the more so as this well may be the first and last time it happens. Fashion Madness: We're kinda scrapping the bottom of the barrel here; however, seeing the whole crew decked up in brand-new outfits and all pimped up for the winter definitely adds a certain je ne sais quoi to the game. I would have loved to see those warbrobes changes happen sooner, maybe as early as in the original game — but hey, better late than ever.A beach scene in a winter-themed game, now that's real edgy. Let's be honest, I'll probably have forgotten all about WM by next week; however, I had a decently pleasant time playing it. Still, I hope there won't be anymore CR fandiscs with themes I'm a sucker for, because I'm starting to suffer from serious CR fatigue at that point. Thanks for reading and drop by anytime, dear fellow gamers!"},
{"title": "Steins;Gate 0: The better game", "date": "19/03/2019", "text": "After my less-than-stellar experience with Steins;Gate — The Original, I was hell-bent on avoiding the series at all costs. That's why I gave Steins;Gate 0 a resounding pass, despite the fact that it was branded as excellent and had the potential to solve narrative issues I had with its predecessor. Things would have remained that way, if not for a recent perfect storm that saw me ravenous for VNs just as the PSN was offering outrageous discounts on the whole genre; before I knew it, SG0 was in my digital collection, and there was no turning back. Like, literally.That impulse purchase could have been a most ill-inspired one; but to my utter surprise, I found myself genuinely enjoying SG0. I certainly wouldn't deem it the VN of the century, but I definitely liked it much more than the original game. One might quip that it wasn't so hard, given how much I despised said original game; and while I'm keen to admit that my total lack of expectations may have played a role in my ultimately positive opinion of SG0, I also think that this game is genuinely better than its predecessor and fixes a good number of issues that ran rampant in said predecessor. (SPOILERS ahead!)Better plot: One of SG's biggest flaws for yours truly was its unwelcome focus on romance, which weakened the overall story on top of introducing uncalled-for diversions. It was just aggravating to be force-fed all that fluff and fan-service, when the fate of the world itself hung in the balance and characters should have been focusing on something — anything — else than romance. In SG0, romance is all but forgotten, and the grim future awaiting the world in the Beta world line takes center stage: Okabe gets to feast his horrified eyes on the famed Third World War, which definitely knocks some (much-needed) sense into him. Needless to say, I lapped up that newfound, unwavering focus on the dangers looming ahead; and while I absolutely despised SG's dumb, immature, horny-when-he-shouldn't-be Okabe, I found SG0's subdued, thoughtful, spanked-hard-by-life Okabe much more likeable — and relatable. And since I'm mentioning Okabe, it's worth noting that he's not the main focus of the story anymore: while he was part of pretty much every scene in SG, SG0 treats us to plenty of scenes starring other members of the crew — sans Okabe. Last but not least, the ad hoc epidemy that plagued SG is blissfully absent from SG0 — as shown by that single telling example: while Faris is granted Reading Steiner out of the blue to solve a narrative bind in SG, several characters gain it gradually as part of an overarching plot development in SG0. Better routes and endings: One of my main beefs with SG was the arcane quality of most endings, especially the True one. Route triggers were frustratingly unclear, and the game had the sheer audacity of requiring not one, but several flags for the True Ending. I can safely claim that I would never have witnessed said True Ending if not for FAQs, and I'm confident I'm not the only one. Fortunately, progression flows much more smoothly in SG0: triggers are delightfully obvious, and there is but a single flag required for the True Ending — a flag that you just cannot miss, given that it's part of another ending required to gain access to the true one. Not only are endings much easier to attain this time around, but they are also much more cohesive and constructive. While SG delivered mostly filler, 'cul-de-sac' endings that left characters stranded and didn't connect to the bigger picture, every single of SG0's endings contributes to the building of the plot. This time around, our experience as players mirrors the characters' experience in the game. Just like them, we travel through world lines, experiment with triggers and accumulate the necessary knowledge to ultimately reach Steins;Gate — with Reading Steiner being akin to us remembering former routes, and time travel to us replaying the game and avoiding pitfalls.Better characters: Everybody gets a new lease on life, with established characters gaining a welcome depth and new ones being thoroughly developed. Okabe acts like an adult this time around and not like a horny teenager, and Daru's pervy quips come across as welcome attempts to lighten the mood. Maho is awesome and probably the most interesting and nuanced new addition, and her amazingly deep and complex relationship with Kurisu goes way beyond usual VN standards in the matter. Daru and Suzuha's ever-growing father-daughter bond is totally believable and incredibly touching, and one of the sweetest developement in SG0 — I swear I was nearly brought to tears by some of their interactions.  Suzuha herself cements her status as one of the most haunting characters in the series and gets some truly iconic and striking moments, and crazy b*tch Moeka gets her character ever-so-slightly redeemed. Even Kurisu, who is absent for most of the game, manages to shine and leave an deep imprint — in fact, I daresay that she's even more memorable than in SG. The only important character that gets put on the back burner somewhat is, ironically enough, Mayuri; however, that kinda makes sense in the context of the story. Not only is she not privy to Okabe's angsty world line endeavours in SG0, but it also makes sense that after choosing the Beta world line to save Mayuri, Okabe would then focus more on what he lost in the process — namely Kurisu.Of course, I would lie if I deemed SG0 perfect. We're still dealing with a flawed game: the story is a mite unclear and confusing at times, it's still too packed with eye-rolling fan-service, and it still dabbles too much in narrative conveniences and emotional porn. (Pray tell, why does Kagari look so much like Kurisu? I expected some juicy filiation to come up at some point, but it seems that her unlikely looks are really just there to tug at Okabe's heartstrings and make his predicament even harder.) The True Ending should have been more fleshed-out, and not just a mere chapter at the end of an already played route. The game should have solely used new character art, instead of clumsily blending old and new character models.But when all is said and done, I liked that game despite its flaws. It really should have been the template for the original game; and as it is, it fixes said original game and the series' lore as a whole an awful lot. Sure, there are casualties involved, as SG's True Ending is made the one and only valid outcome and all other endings are deemed null and void in the process; but since those endings sucked anyway, it's really not that big of a deal. I actually like to think that SG's True Ending, complete with the SG0 intermission, is the ultimate canon in the SG universe; and I would even be inclined to replay both games successively to enjoy the full experience, if not for the fact that I pawned my copy of SG long ago. And with that, dear fellow gamers, I'm done with my praise of SG0, a.k.a. The Game That Reconciled Me With The Series. Thanks for reading as usual, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Seven years of gaming happiness: Collecting 'em games ", "date": "14/03/2019", "text": "One year ago, I told you everything about my Second Coming of Gaming, dear fellow gamers. This was a story of hope lost and found, the tale of a gamer coming back home after years of forced exile from the gaming industry; it was moving, it was striking, and it felt like destiny. The story of how I became a collector, on the other hand, is pretty subdued. It's a tale of stealth, the story of a hobby taking a life of its own and expanding beyond my wildest expectations. If gaming was Metal Slug's Marco Rossi, making a bold and triumphant return into my life, then collecting was Metal Gear's Solid Snake, sneaking in and becoming a thing before I even realized it. Make yourselves comfortable and bring in the pop-corn, dear fellow gamers: here comes the story of how I became a Game Collector.Collecting was never on my radar during my formative gaming years, due to a multitude of reasons. The sheer lack of funds and games to collect was obviously a major obstacle; but had my bank account overflowed with money and Europe with localized games, I don't think I would have indulged in stacking up cartridges nonetheless. See, I was not exactly concerned with perennity and replayability as a youngster: the best was yet to come, and the next game in line was always more exciting than the current one. Mind you, this carefree consumerism was far from being exclusive to yours truly: gamers at large, as well as the gaming industry itself, proudly exhibited that same careless attitude. The truth is that pretty much everybody back in the days saw gaming as a hobby for idle youngsters and consoles as mere toys, bound to be discarded as soon as the newer and flashier piece of kit stormed into the market. We were all ruthless, latching onto new gaming systems and fads with an enthusiasm only rivaled by our eagerness to get rid of formerly beloved games and consoles; as a matter of fact, the only thing more shameful that not owning the current hot console was to be caught enjoying an game from the former console generation.With such a background, suffice it to say that I had no plans whatsoever of becoming a collector when I got back into gaming in early 2012. Sure, I was slightly more concerned with perennity than in the '90s, as I wanted to hold onto my precious cartridges this time around; however, I was only planning to purchase a couple of games and leave it at that. Heck, other handhelds were not even on my radar yet, let alone backup units: as far as 2012's me was concerned, the DS my beloved sister gave me was going to be my one and only system. Oh boy, how things have changed since; and how I laugh at my own past naivety and candor now, sitting on piles of dozens of games and pieces of kit.So how did I become a collector, exactly? Well, that unexpected development is to blame on several things, the first one being Amazon's fiendishly devious yet highly enjoyable suggestion system — you know, that falsely innocent \"Customers who viewed this item also viewed\" section, choke-full with games irresistibly similar to the one you're just checking. I kid you not: this section alone is responsible for dozens of purchases, and can account for a massive chunk of my precious collection. Not that it's a bad thing at all, mind you; I was more than glad to cave in, and that suggestion system allowed me to discover the full extent of all my systems' RPG libraries, which would probably have remained unknown to me otherwise.The question is, why was I so glad to cave in indeed? What made me purchase games so ravenously, despite boasting neither a strong collecting background nor any intention to ever become a full-blown collector? I could chalk it all up to pure greed, but there is actually more to it. In mid-2013, I owned roughly 50 DS games; a respectable number, granted, but one that certainly wouldn't have warranted a featuring in Retro Gamer's Collector's Corner. My collecting fully took flight in late 2013, reaching its peak in 2014 and soaring high until mid-2015; and that two-year bout of intense and frantic collecting matched a troublesome period in my life. To sum it up, this was the time when I rented a matchbox-sized flat in a shitty industrial neighbourhood, slaving away in a job that I only marginally enjoyed in order to save money to purchase my very own piece of real estate; and although I fully chose that situation and owned it, there's no denying that it was a teeny-tiny bit trying and taxing. A fair bit of escapism was in order; and lo and behold, collecting games gave me exactly that. (And so did playing games and writing about them — it's no coincidence indeed that I started this very blog in late 2013, a couple of months after moving into my pint-sized dump.)With hindsight, it kinda boggles my mind to see how much I accomplished on the collecting front in those mere two years. Not only did I build up a full roster of handhelds, with the PSP, the Vita, the 3DS and the GBA joining my precious DS; but I also bought dozens of games, primarily DS and PSP ones. Those games were so dirt cheap that I could literally purchase several of them every week while still saving dough like a squirrel on steroids. By the time I finally left my tiny dumpster in mid-2015, my precious collection had cracked the three-digit limit and I had become a full-blown collector. In the meantime, concerns regarding perennity had also kicked in, along with a growing desire to compensate for my frustrating meagre gaming years (more on that in this post); the latter only added fuel to the raging fire of my collecting, and the former prompted me to purchase backup units, supplementary cables and extra batteries for all my systems. Better safe than sorry, indeed. I slowed down ever-so-slightly in late 2015, and my collecting reached its cruising speed. The next two years saw me collect at a steady yet more relaxed pace, focusing more on the Vita and the 3DS and the Game Boy line — without forgetting the occasional DS or PSP hidden gem that had passed me by until then. 2018 saw a noticeable slowdown in all things collecting: with Vita and 3DS releases slowing down to a trickle, only a handful of new games joined my precious collection, along with a couple of Japanese exclusives that had been lounging on my To-Get-My-Paws-On List for years. 2019 is shaping up to be even more indolent, as Sony is about to stop the production of Vita cartridges in the West and Nintendo is slowly but surely abandoning the 3DS to focus on the Switch. Although I predicted the complete halt of my collecting endeavours several times already on that very blog, that probably won't happen any time soon: not only will Vita games still be released in Japan, but I'll also have the random overlooked gem from older console generations to keep me occupied. I'm actually looking forward to that more relaxed purchasing pace, with only the odd acquisition here and there to remind me of my halcyon days of collecting.Reminding, indeed: because apart from precious, solid physical games, that whole collecting epic will leave me with heartwarming, wholesome memories. Oh, those thrilling hours spent hunting for games on the internet whilst listening to uplifting music! That giddy joy I felt every time I unearthed a new game worthy of joining the fray! That sheer delight that washed over me every time I pored over my collection! From the wonder and elation of the early stages to the contentment and sated gratefulness of recent years, without forgetting the eagerness and ardour of the 'escapism wanted' era, every phase of my collecting career was truly magical — and very much worth remembering indeed. Heck, I even look fondly on all the missteps that occurred along the way. Paying too much for North-American games on Amazon.co.uk because I didn't know yet that Amazon.com and Amazon.ca offered cheaper prices, ordering a Japanese game only to learn a couple of weeks later that it was going to be localized, landing a filthy GBA bootleg: that sure didn't amuse me at the time, but the seasoned collector I've become cannot help but smile at those antics. And that, dear fellow gamers, was the story of how I became a proud and happy Game Collector. Those seven years of collecting were a most amazing ride indeed, and I'm firmly planning to enjoy that ride's ultimate stages to the fullest. Feel free to share your own collecting tales in the comment section, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, thanks a million for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Oreshika-Tainted Bloodlines: I'm full, thanks", "date": "10/03/2019", "text": "Somehow, I knew this would happen. I took me so long to figure out OTB's many systems and find my stride that there was indeed a high probability that I would find myself sated before reaching the final boss; and that high probability has now become reality. I still love that game with a passion, but I've also had my fill of it for the time being.Mind you, I did everything I mentioned in my last post. I roamed dungeons, racked up skills, had fun with breeding, acquired Heirlooms and, last but certainly not least, I cleared my fourth Feast of All Demons; and I had tons of fun doing all that. It was so utterly fulfilling, in fact, that I feel like the game should end right here and now. On top of that, my inner clock tells me that I've been playing for 60 hours at the very least, and that's more than enough for an RPG playthrough. So I'm gonna call it quits for now, and bid adieu to my clan while I'm at it: because let's be honest, when I feel the itch to play OTB again, I'll certainly start anew and roll with a fresh new family. Sayonara, Ebisu Clan: we had great times together, and I regret nothing.Since I'm done for now, I might as well deliver some final thoughts on OTB. That game's official subtitle might as well have been 'Player vs. Randomness', because that's exactly what the whole thing is about. That game is nothing but a giant random fest: from dungeon layouts to boss hideouts, from stats gains to monster drops, from units' looks to their gene pools, everything is subject to variations — some minute, some wild. Will you, the player, take up the gauntlet and make the most of what you're allotted in any given run? Will you get lucky, or will you have a hard ride? This randomness is actually one of my favourite features in OTB: although it can be taxing to wrap one's head around it at first, it also guarantees that no two runs of the game will ever be the same, which makes for great replay value.I guess I should also comment on the Nueko situation, i.e. OTB's most controversial feature. Nueko's forced inclusion in my party was nowhere near as vexatious as I had feared from reading online comments on the matter; however, I also sincerely feel that said inclusion adds absolutely nothing to the game. In fact, Nueko as a whole adds absolutely nothing to the game. It was nearly laughable to hear the gods describe her as that irresistible femme fatale who wrapped everybody around her finger, when she was actually behaving like a sullen, boring teenager everytime I got to interact with her. Why was she even there at all, may I ask? Was she supposed to be OTB's official waifu, dragging in the otaku crew in her wake? Or was she supposed to act as a story beacon, reminding the player of the narrative issues at stake? I don't know, and I honestly don't care. All I saw in Nueko was an free extra party member for boss fights; and while I certainly didn't need her to do the deed, I still made the most of her occasional presence. Still, I would have preferred OTB's story to be solely about my clan; because as it was, I couldn't bring myself to follow it, let alone care about it. Why should I give a crap about the family matters of complete strangers, when I have my own family to tend to? What do I care about a god's mommy complex, when my own clan's fast-dying members fight an uphill battle against fate itself? Letting the player be privy to that little family drama between immortals was tacky and tactless at best, and a big fat instance of trolling at worst.What else? I was planning to write a list of the game's good and bad points, but I'll shelve it until my next run — and until I clear the game for good. Not only do I feel too sated to write another full post about OTB right now, but I've fought enough cheated final bosses and witnessed enough lame story resolutions to know that endgames can indeed provide plenty of material for such lists. And so, dear fellow gamers, I'll take my leave of OTB for the time being. It's an fantastic game, and I love it to pieces; and I sure am darn glad I invested in the japanese special edition two years ago. You can bet I'll replay it someday, be it in japanese or in english. Thanks for reading, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Oreshika - Tainted Bloodlines: Reaching cruise speed", "date": "05/03/2019", "text": "My love for OTB has escalated into an ungodly obsession: I find myself gorging on it more and more and trying to sneak in playing sessions everywhere I can. Generations wax and wane, dungeons are conquered and bosses are vanquished as in-game years and real-life hours go by, and I'm inching ever closer to the final showdown.\"Inching\" is the right word indeed. Even after an undisclosed by the game yet probably ludicrously high number of playing hours, I still have a hard time dealing with, well, time management. Bloody time management, which coerces me into a given course of action when I'd rather be doing something else. So you want to vanquish an Oni boss? Oops, they haven't reappeared yet — better luck next time!  You want to explore the depths of a dungeon? Nope, you have to breed and train your kids — come back in three months! You want to tackle a Feast? Too bad, you didn't transmigrate Nueko early enough — try again next year! You want to do anything that requires a couple of months at a time? Crap, your clan leader is about to bite the dust, and you have to prepare succession — come back in one bloody generation! It took me forever to clear the third Feast, because I could never find that sweet spot where everybody was prepped up and with enough life expectancy to pull it off. My family members were too young or too old, or there was not enough time to transmigrate and train Nueko, or some mandatory breeding was standing in the way; I breathed a huge sigh of relief when the planets finally aligned and I got my opportunity to strike, let me tell you that.After being done with that third Feast at long last, I took myself some time to breath, regroup and map out my objectives for the next couple of generations. Waiting for that perfect blink of an eye to fight Seimei took a toll on my gaming morale, and I feel the need to forget about that cursed immortal for a while and unwind through other pursuits. Here's my plan for the next in-game decade: 1-Explore dungeons at leisure and to my heart's content. I finally saved enough money to get my paws on that famed wooden tag, the one that grants you access to a room containing all the game's keys in the Garden of Purrfection; all said keys are now in my possession, and no dungeon can resist me anymore. This is actually both a blessing and a curse: while it's great not to worry about keys anymore, this also means that the game's natural difficulty curve is destroyed, leaving me free to bump into foes far too strong for my clan's current level. (Of course, that makes for good power-leveling as well — before I scurry away after three battles to lick my gaping wounds, that is.) Anyway, since the game was kind enough to offer me brand-new dungeons after the third Feast, I'm definitely going to explore them, and thoroughly at that. We don't want to be called ungrateful, now do we?2-Get my paws on Heirlooms. Now that I don't have to save one million ryōs anymore, I can treat my clan to those insanely expensive pieces of gear. The town's development level has a direct influence on the quality of the Heirlooms, so I'll start by raising my Weapon and Armour shops' levels. A bit of careful observation conveniently revealed that Heirloom stats vary between clan members, but also from month to month; so I'm gonna bide my time in the shadows and pounce when an Heirloom with stellar stats appear. 3-Follow my breeding instinct. I focused primarily on gods with good Fire genes during the early stages of my run, and it worked nicely for me. Lately though, I've been following Kochin's advice more often, just to see if the little weasel was indeed breeding-wise; but alas, it didn't work too great. I can tell that Kochin suggested gods whose gene pools would rectify the huge Fire imbalance in my clan and make my gene pool more harmonious; and while I can see the merits of such an approach, the result doesn't suit my playing style at all. I ended up with weaklings that cannot one-slice rows of foes without breaking a sweat like their ancestors did, and that's not what I signed for. Starting next generation, I'm ignoring Kochin's advice and following my mating instinct again. 4-Expand my Skill pool. While my clan's Fire expertise is nicely developed, they are stuck at the very first Skill level in all other elements despite owning scrolls for high-level Skills. I'm going to remedy that sorry state of affairs by making good use of the Mind and Heart-raising accessories. I've experimented a bit with them and noticed that if you equip them and let a month pass, your clan members will learn Skills if their boosted Mind/Heart is high enough to hit requirements. That's already pretty nifty, but there's something even niftier: take away the accessory, and the newly acquired Skills remain! Needless to say, I'm going to use and abuse that feature without a second thought. It's built into the game, so it's not cheating, is it? If I'm lucky, I may also learn a couple of Secret Arts in the process. In other words, I'm gonna roam&grind like there's no tomorrow, because that's exactly what the aforementioned pursuits imply. Seimei can wait until I'm in the mood to confront him again; a couple of years sure don't mean anything for an immortal prick like him, do they? See you soon for the next chapter of my OTB epopee, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, thanks a lot for stopping by!"},
{"title": "Oreshika - Tainted Bloodlines: I'm on a roll", "date": "01/03/2019", "text": "How do you know you're hooked on a game? Well, if you cannot wait to get your fix and if said game's music keeps looping in your head all day long, that's a pretty good sign that you're hooked indeed. I'm still playing the fourth attempt I mentioned in my last post; and at that point, said fourth attempt has been promoted to my official OTB run.This means that I can now dive into the specifics of said official run! My four starting dungeons are the Ash of Heavens, the Temple of the Dragon, the Heptacolour Hot Springs and the Garden of Purrfection. Based on what I've infered from OTB wisdom on the internet, this is a pretty good combination indeed, with the two latter dungeons hosting a number of nifty items. That's not to say that my run became any easier in the process; in fact, I suspect it's the opposite indeed. Heptacolour and Purrfection are a pain to navigate to start with, and navigation was made even harder by the fact that I was nearly bereft of Keys at first. I got my paws on the 'ro' wooden tag and the Yellow Key in Heptacolour pretty early on; however, the 'ro' tag was useless because I couldn't access the matching door yet, and the Yellow Key could only do so much for my progression. This left me kinda stuck: while polishing off my first Feast of All Demons was but a mere formality, I couldn't access the second one because it was located too deep in Purrfection, with an Oni Boss blocking the way. Heck, Oni bosses were actually blocking the way in every single dungeon, and there was little hope I could eradicate them with my puny first generations of clan members.So, how do you think I got out of that bind, dear fellow gamers? Why, through good ol' grinding, of course! I started dutifully racking up Devotion; and before long, through the magic of breeding and genetics, my family had become strong enough to wipe out Oni obstructions. (I'm actually a tad overleveled, if I have to be totally honest; but that will make the upcoming difficulty spikes easier, so I'm not complaining.) I could then progress at long last, and I got hold of two more Keys and the 'i' wooden tag. I'm currently in the process of tying loose ends and roaming the few parts still unexplored in dungeons, just to make sure that I'm not missing on yet another Key; and after that, I'll tackle my second Feast of All Demons and move onwards. I still have to find that fabled room with all Keys in Purrfection, which I suspect is hiding behind the 'ha' door located at the entrance of the dungeon. The corresponding tag is currently available in my town's General Store for an outrageous one-or-so million ryōs. That has to be one of the most expensive RPG item I've seen in a long time; however, I'm pretty confident I can get my cheating-hungry paws on it in a matter if hours. They don't call me thrifty for nothing, after all.After several tries with speed settings, I finally found the balance I was looking for: I roll with Serious when I want to crawl, and with Fortunate when I want to grind. Finding the right balance in all things fighting was a tad trickier: no matter how hard I tried, I always ended up with one idle party member that didn't get to strike in 99% of random encounters. That wouldn't have been a problem, if not for the fact that said idle party member was sucking precious XP and devotion. I was certainly not going to keep a family member fed, clothed and leveled-up only for boss fights, thank you very much; and after a bit of pondering, I decided to play it daring and roll with a mere two units. I was a tad febrile, as you might expect; however, my fears were unfounded, as this setting works beautifully indeed. My Fab Two are a Halberdier and a Dancer, a combination that can pretty much clean a random encounter battlefield in a single turn; and to my relief, that duo also does a great job at vanquishing bosses so far.Having two units only also makes party management much smoother, allowing me to settle into a comfortable routine: once my units are done studying, I crawl relentlessly with them until the older one reaches their peak, right before decay starts. I breed said older unit and let them train their offspring, while my younger unit grinds solo; then, I send the offspring in dungeons with my younger unit for a bout of levelling-up, while my older unit stays at home until bitting the dust. Once my younger unit hits their peak, I breed them and let them train their offspring, while the older offspring grinds solo; once the younger unit bites the dust as well, the cycle is over and can start again. This is so soothing and satisfying, I could go on like that forever. It's the circle of liiiiife... With that said, I'm done with the current OTB tidings, dear fellow gamers! But I'll see you very soon for more indeed. Thanks for reading, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Oreshika - Tainted Bloodlines: Feeling my way", "date": "25/02/2019", "text": "I've been playing Oreshika-Tainted Bloodlines, or OTB for short, for a good five hours. Those early stages were not exactly smooth, shall we say; in fact, they were so uncomfortable that I considered quitting the game entirely at some point. Fortunately, I soldiered on; and I'm glad I did, because things are slowly but surely getting better between me and OTB.But I'm getting ahead of myself there. OTB initially confused me to no end with its outlandish gameplay mechanics — it still does, if I have to be totally honest; but we're getting there. The game's weird mix of hand-holding and free reining was especially bewildering for me: I initially mistook Kochin's monthly suggestions for a lengthy tutorial, before realizing that they were mere guidelines and that I still had to manage my time carefully to avoid missing on important events. Another perplexing thing are the actual tutorials, which tend to elaborate on obvious points that any seasoned RPG player should figure out by themselves yet leave other important features completely in the dark. So there's a tutorial to explain how to engage enemies, but none whatsoever to explain the mechanics of stat blending in the Rite of Union? The latter would have been a mite more useful than the former, methinks. And since I'm mentioning the rite of union, why are the gods' stats not expressed via numbers, and why do they flutter constantly? I get the feeling that you're trying to confuse me here, game. Just like when you omit to tell me if Heirlooms can be passed upon the next generation, leaving me agonizing about whether or not it's worth investing in them. Or when you don't bother telling me what Training and Bequeathing do, how and why I should use them. Or what all those fancy elemental stats stand for. Such little omissions are a dime a dozen in OTB, and they can make a player's life a misery. Other things were bothering me, such as the rapid flow of time in dungeons and the stringent time management aspect: while I managed to progress, it didn't feel like I actually accomplished anything. I was on the wrong rails, and drastic measures were required if I wanted to enjoy that game. I resorted to my tried-and-tested trick in such circumstances, namely to start a fresh new run. That's when I discovered some things I had not suspected, such as the fact that a number of things are actually random: that includes dungeons and their inner layouts, inventory in stores, and the very title of the whole epopee. I could also figure out a number of things that had passed me by, as well as reinforce what I did know. However, we were not quite there yet; I had chosen different classes for that second run, and those classes didn't work well enough together for my taste. I still trouble managing my time, especially the Rite of Union and my first passing of the torch. That's when I decided not only to wipe the slate clean again and start another run, but also to experiment profusely with different settings until I managed to strike gold and get one that clicked with me. OTB's swift early stages nicely accommodate such dummy runs, and I'm currently busy with my fourth try. I'm not quite sure yet if it'll be the last; but I'll get there eventually.As I'm wrapping my head around the gameplay mechanics more and more with each try, I'm pondering how I should play. My instinct would have me stubbornly sticking to the same gods as much as possible for the Rite of Union: since this is a game, inbreeding probably won't be factored in when it comes to character growth, will it? The (in)famous Nueko character is not there yet, but I'm preparing myself for her inevitable invasion of my family — and my party — by getting used to fighting with only three units. As a matter of fact, I'm definitely gonna stick to a run with no more than three active party members at any given time (bar Nueko). Each youth will be trained by their parent and take their stead in the party when the time is ripe; no idle and dejected family members losing loyalty at the heardquarters, everybody will get their fifteen minutes of fame on the battlefield. Like, literally. Well, that's it for now! I'll see you soon with more tidings of fighting&breeding, dear fellow gamers. As always, thanks a lot for reading, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Coveted Games: Some come, some go", "date": "21/02/2019", "text": "Gee, it's been a while since I last wrote a Coveted Games post! Now's a bit of a special time when it comes to my gaming purchases, because a) some systems are quietly taking their leave while another is taking the scene, and b) my list of planned purchases has shrunk to nearly nothing, making each game stand out all the more. Without further ado, dear fellow gamers, here are the games on my radar for 2019!Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth - 3DS: Although Ninty are still supporting their ultimate dedicated handheld to an extent, new releases are drying up fast for the poor system. As I'm writing this, Persona Q2 is the one and only 3DS game I'm getting my paws on in 2019; and let's be honest, it may well be the last 3DS I ever purchase. I was hoping for a localization of Etrian Mystery Dungeon 2 or a remake of Etrian Odyssey 3 for the longest time, but I get they won't be happening now.Code Realize - Wintertide Miracles: I played the original game and the first fandisc already, so I might as well dive even deeper and indulge in that third instalment. Heck, I'm such a huge sucker for all things winter that the title and theme alone would be enough to draw me in. Penny-Punching Princess, The Longest Five Minutes, The Lost Child - Vita: A.k.a. the ultimate trilogy of physical Vita games released by NISA. Needless to say, I'm gonna snatch 'em all, if only to express my overflowing gratitude to NISA for those late, undreamt-of treats. Oh, and it sure doesn't hurt that all three are RPGs and that I absolutely adored The Lost Child.  Variable Barricade - Vita: I'm head over heels in love with the gorgeous, luscious art style of that Japan-exclusive otome, and I'm gonna get it no matter what. I probably won't understand half of what happens for the longest time, but I don't care as long as I can feast my eyes on the unbelievably stylish characters. Heck, the MC alone is already my favourite otome heroine ever, and I've not even played the game yet. Asdivine Hearts 2, Alvastia Chronicles, Chronus Arc - Vita: There would be a lot to say about my uncanny passion for Kemco's budget retro-ish RPGs, but that post isn't the right place to do so. Suffice it to say that I'll get and play that trio with gusto. Limited Run Games is just about to unleash Chronus Arc on us collectors; and if they decide to release the other two, I'll sure stand in line to get my paws on them. The House in Fata Morgana, Sharin no Kuni - Vita: A pair of visual novels that look original and promising. Needless to say, I'll get the Limited Run physical versions; they'll probably be the same price than the digital versions anyway, and Limited Run offerings are a solid investment for any game collector. RemiLore: Lost Girl in the Lands of Lore - Switch: Now we're moving on to the Switch! I still stand by my pledge of not collecting for the system; however, that won't prevent me from purchasing and enjoying a couple of games — before pawning them, that is. RemiLore is a roguelike, and there are not nearly enough of these out there; I certainly won't miss the opportunity to play this one, be it a once-in-a-lifetime experience.The Princess Guide - Switch: I already own the Vita version of that RPG/strategy game, and that version is the true collector's item. Nevertheless, I'm still gonna purchase the Switch version for learning purposes, just like I did with Labyrinth of Refrain. It will certainly make my gamer's life easier to get the hang of that game in english before I ever replay it in japanese. Super Neptunia RPG - Switch: As a die-hard fan of the Hyperdimension Neptunia series, this game is a must-have. I'm a bit miffed that it's not coming to the Vita, as it would have been a nice addition to the large roster of HN games already released on the system. But at least, I'll get to play that one, unlike the PS4-exclusive Megadimension Neptunia VII (insert resentful eyes).That's it for my To-Get-My-Paws-On List for 2019 so far, dear fellow gamers! Of course, other games can always pop up, so that list is by no means exhaustive; as a matter of fact, the second half of 2019 will probably bring more entries, on the Switch front at least — and hopefully, hopefully, on the Vita and 3DS ones as well. A handheld aficionado can always hope for late releases, can't they? Feel free to share your own coveted games for 2019, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, thanks a million for reading, and drop by anytime!"},
{"title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2: The fallout", "date": "17/02/2019", "text": "I just pawned my copy of Xenoblade Chronicles 2, seven months after clearing my run of it. The reason is simple: although I had tons of fun playing that game, I'm pretty confident that I'm never going to touch it again. This is partly due to how long and extensive my playthrough was: after 160 hours spent roaming and grinding, I feel like I've seen nearly all XC2 had to offer. However, there are other, more sinister reasons that make me want to steer clear from that game henceforth. The truth is that thinking back to my run makes me feel a mite nauseous. As entertaining as said run was, it left a sour aftertaste in my mouth; and I can't help but feel like most of it was a sheer waste of time. In the process, I came to acknowledge a couple of unsavoury things about XC2, things I had not realized earlier because of how smitten I was with the game.Nope, I won't be running through Alrest ever again.It's really shallow: Although the sentence \"Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle\" is mostly associated with Skyrim, it also perfectly applies to XC2. This is a game that wows you at first with its massive scale; however, once you start shearing the fat, you realize that XC2 is not much deeper than your average RPG. At its core, that game is just about running around, fulfilling quests and killing the boss du jour, which is pretty much the program offered by 95% of RPGs out there. XC2 tries to present itself as that complex, layered game that provides a deep gameplay experience; however, that supposed complexity is but smoke and mirrors. Take the infamous fighting system, for instance: it's said to be quite intricate, but it's actually anything but. Most of the intricacy stems from the game's intentionally elusive tutorials, which leave you in the dark about most combat features and force you to experiment on your own. You might have an eureka moment when you suddenly uncover a fighting mechanic that wasn't clear until now; but the truth is that a better designed game would have filled you in right of the bat — and acknowledged its own simplicity in the process. The same goes for sidequests: although the game tries to pass them as convoluted endeavours by piling up the steps towards completion and making you run all around the world map, they're really just mere fetch quests at their core. Same story for items, which could be ten times less numerous without any discernable influence on the gameplay, and so on and so forth.  Sorry, Dahlia — We'll never ever meet after all.It's rife with fake longevity: XC2 has to be one of the most bloated RPGs I've ever played, if not the most bloated. Everything in that game seems to have been designed to inflate play time, in the most artificial and irritating way. The sheer breadth of the game world is the most obvious display of fake longevity here, with those humongous distances that force you to spend dozens of minutes just running; however, that is far from being the only offender. An exhaustive list of said offenders would have to include the heavy gatcha/RNG element, which can lengthen the obtention of a full Rare Blade roster towards infinity and make salvaging rare items a real pain. It would also have to include that darn Tiger!Tiger! game, which is so impossibly grindy it's not even funny, as well as the requirements for unlocking most of the Rare Blades' affinity charts, which typically involve hours of grinding. Let's not forget the Skill animations, which are way longer than they should be, and the forced slowdown of running speed in battle. Take pretty much every feature in XC2, and you'll find fake longevity nested somewhere in it. Heck, I'm pretty sure Monolith Soft would have dispensed with quest markers and instant travel in the name of increased play time, if not for the fact that the game would have become virtually unplayable in the process.I'll kinda miss you, Pyra. So long, goodbye, hooray, Mythra.All in all, I feel that XC2 somewhat scammed me. It stole my precious time by making itself bigger than it needed to be, forced me to toil to understand gameplay mechanics that should have been made clear from the very beginning, duped me by posing as a fancier game than it actually is, and ultimately swindled me of my gamer's affections. I won't denying that I was utterly and totally hooked on that game; but with hindsight, that attachment had more to do with a case of mild addiction that with genuine, unadulterated love. Sure, there were some things I utterly and totally fancied when I played the game, such as the fighting system and the grandiose vistas; however, all those things ultimately failed to leave a lasting imprint on my gamer's soul. That whole experience confirms something I already surmised; namely that long, sprawling RPGs are not my cup of tea and that I favour compact offerings much more indeed. To quote an example rooted in the latest gaming news, I'd choose Link's Awakening over Breath of the Wild any day of the week. At any rate, XC2 has now left my game library, probably for all eternity; and let's face it, I'm relieved. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Fallen Legion: Gameplay wanted", "date": "13/02/2019", "text": "A couple of months ago, Limited Run Games released a physical edition of Fallen Legion. I remember pondering a purchase for a while, before ultimately renouncing. I had that unexplicable feeling that purchasing that one game would be a bad idea, even though it seemed to be a match made in heaven on paper; and boy, was my gaming instinct right on the mark, for the millionth time.Seriously, that game is a complete joke. Even if you can somehow ignore the fact that it was artificially cut in two and initially required two bloody gaming systems to be enjoyed to the fullest (in every darn sense of the word), there is no ignoring the horrendous performances issues that plague its Vita half. Loading times that stretch towards infinity, slowdowns up the wazoo, jaggy animations, you name it — and suffer through it. Should you choose to grind and bear it and soldier on, the gameplay will probably give you the coup de grâce. To call that mess of a game an Action RPG is an resounding insult to the whole genre. Fallen Legion is a pared-down Beat 'em up-meets-ARPG that only lets you do the barest minimum on the battlefield, and sometimes not even that. You cannot jump, move vertically or behind enemies, nor perform a variety of attacks or target body parts like in any good Beat 'em up; and neither can you open menus, evade and retreat to regroup like in any decent ARPG. So the only thing left to do is mindlessly spam attacks until there's nothing left standing, right? NOPE! You can't even indulge in the joy of button-mashing, because the characters have ATB gauges. Are you serious, game? So the little, so very little you let me do has to be precisely timed? Why the heck did the developers choose to sneak in a Turn-based RPG feature in the first place, and one that so completely hampers real-time combat to boot? Were you trolling here, YummyYummyTummy? Gimme a break — and take back your crappy game while you're at it.I'm pissed off that I purchased such a grossly incompetent game; on the other hand, I'm glad I did so on a PSN sale and gave the Limited Run edition a pass. Needless to say, I didn't finish the thing and gave up after an hour spent gritting my teeth, spitting at my Vita's screen and racking up Game Overs like it was going out of fashion. On a more general note, I have to admit that I'm not quite fond of that current trend of mixing gameplay elements from various genres when it comes to all things fighting. This used to be pretty rare back in the days, with only a precious few daring to cross boundaries; nowadays, it seems that every developer and their brother try their hand at it. But while venerable series such as Tales and Hyperdimension Neptunia managed to pull off the crossover thing in an elegant way, newer developers more often than not fail utterly at it, dumping half-unplayable RPGs on poor unsuspecting players. Dear developers, please don't try to be original just for the sake of it: a solid one-flavour RPG is still a million times better than a weak multi-flavoured one. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Lost Child: Final Thoughts", "date": "09/02/2019", "text": "After 50 hours of non-stop crawling, I'm finally done with TLC. That certainly took a bit longer than I expected; however, I regret nothing, as every single minute spent playing that game was pure delight. I could get myself even more crawling goodness by tackling R'lyeh Road, the game's 99-floor complimentary dungeon; however, experience have taught me that postgame dungeons in dungeon crawlers tend to be sadistic, overblown nuisances. On top of that, I get an inkling that roaming that particular dungeon would require top-notch gear and first-class Astrals, and I'm neither in the mood to farm nor to ditch my faithful trio of Astrals. I'm sure R'lyeh Road has some amazing puzzles in store, but I've had my fill for now. TLC regaled me over and over with its eight dungeons, each one being more challenging and exciting than the last and less than the next; I found myself repeatedly beaming and giggling with delight when discovering the new puzzles, and I can firmly claim that I was not bored a single second when crawling. TLC's progression and difficulty curve is a glorious display of balance and smoothness, culminating in the amazing final dungeon. Oh boy, that final dungeon! It's a pure masterpiece, and it's hands down one of the best final dungeons I've roamed in any RPG, ever. Not only is it easy on the eye, but it delivers the best puzzles in the entire game, along with delighfully clever layouts. It's also a vibrant homage to FPDC that offers a perfect potpourri of all the staples of the genre: hidden passageways, pits, damage floors, one-way doors, switches, slides — you name it. Sure, it's quite long and meaty, and it can probably single-handedly account for a solid fifth of my playing time; however, it provides such a engrossing piece of crawling that I totally didn't mind spending hours engulfed in those eight floors.What I do mind, on the other hand, is the disappointing final showdown. Boss fights were never TLC's strongest suit, with most of them being a tad too placid and offering no strategic challenge beyond your usual elemental complementarities; however, the final boss fight takes the cake when it come to flaccid boss fights. TLC's big baddie is a massive HP bag that boasts four different forms, with virtually no difference between said forms when it comes to attack patterns; taking him down is a test of patience and a matter of high levels and stats over strategy. By the time I faced him, Hayato and Lua had hit Lv.51 and Enoch and Pandora were comfortably lounging at Lv.95; and it turned out that I was seriously overleveled. I actually went in just to test the waters, with Pandora's and Enoch's MP bars half-depleted; I certainly didn't expect to survive long, let alone win the whole thing with relative ease. I only struggled ever-so-slightly during the fourth phase, when Lua bit the dust and Hayato was left with a puny 27 HP; however, a Balucia Tear got me out of that pinch, and it was smooth sailing from there. Well, guess that's what you get when you stick to the same Astrals for a whole run, never run from random encounters and backtrack to the save point every five minutes for fear of intempestive crashes.As for the story, well... It sucked, period. Heck, I honestly can't make heads or tails of it even after playing the whole game. That sorry state of affairs is party due to the fact that I spent a lot of time crawling and forgot the latest narrative developments in the process, and mostly due to the fact that the story is poorly told and mixes too many sources of inspiration to be intelligible. (Spoilers!) So you have Cthulhu & the gang, but also angels, fallen angels, demons and egyptian deities? How do they all relate to each other? Ra is a god, but he's not the God? Hayato and Lua are Adam and Eve, yet not really? Who wanted to destroy the mortal world, and who wanted to save it? And who exactly was that titular lost child? Heck, you totally lost me here, game. Good thing I didn't give a crap about the story in the first place. (End of spoilers.)But make no mistakes, dear fellow gamers: TLC is an awesome game, and I loved it from beginning to end. I can even say that my love for it only grew more intense as hours and dungeons went on, and it's now sitting comfortably in my Top 5 Favourites Vita FPDCs. That's a lovely development I certainly didn't expect, and it proves once again that I must ignore reviews, be they laudatory or scathing, and let my ever-reliable gaming instinct run the show. I'm so definitely adding the upcoming physical version to my collection, yes precious. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Lost Child: The Dream Team, Part 2", "date": "05/02/2019", "text": "Let's carry on with the presentation of my perfect TLC party, dear fellow gamers! As I mentioned in my last post, I initially toyed with the idea of doing away with Astrals entirely; however, it didn't take me long to realize that enlisting Astrals yielded nothing but benefits and to start hunting for suitable candidates in earnest. I'll admit it: shallow little me went for looks first and foremost. However, that approach ultimately paid off, as I recruited genuinely excellent Astrals in the process and managed to put together a well-assorted team that could pull off a well-oiled group strategy. Without further ado, here come my very own awesome Astrals!Enoch: A.k.a. the Damager. I didn't exactly choose that hunky blond, as he was kindly given to me by Lucifel; however, since I was short on Astrals at the time, I gladly gave him a spot in my party. And blimey, he's been there ever since! He slowly but surely grew into a formidable offensive powerhouse, wielding physical Skills by the dozen (I have yet to try most of them, seriously) and delivering criticals like it's going out of fashion. He provides physical Wind coverage on regular blows and most Skills, but he also has access to a couple of non-elemental physical Skills that can come in handy when Wind is at disavantage. Add to this a neat HP-absorbing blow and a couple of buffs, and you get a perfectly well-rounded physical damage dealer that has a Skill at the ready for every situation. Enoch's only noticeable flaw is his pitiful defense; however, this kinda comes with the territory, and it remains perfectly manageable as long as one keeps an eye on his HP gauge.Cait Sith: A.k.a. the Healer. I recruited that cute creature fairly early on and gave him a spot in my party instantly — because, you know, cat. Little did I know that this unassuming feline would still be strutting his stuff on the battlefield thirty hours later, and would do a great job at it to boot. He's my dedicated Healer, and his awesome Healing Wind group spell saved my party's arse more times than I care to count. His Territory of the Feeble debuff also comes in handy during boss fights, as well as his one-unit buffs, which are more effective and specialized than Lua's ones. Cherry on the cake, he's blessed with gargantuan amounts of MP, which allows me to spam Healing Wind and lengthen my roaming sessions without a care in the world. And surprisingly enough, he can deliver pretty decent Fire-infused blows as well and thus hold his own on the battlefield when he's not healing! That little kitty is a true hidden gem that, unlike other early recrues, managed to maintain his shine and his edge as time and dungeons went on.Pandora: A.k.a. the Elementalist/Secondary Damager. That fiery elf is one of the game's rarest catch, appearing solely (and fittingly) in treasure chests, and quite seldom at that. By all monster-collecting RPG logic, she had to be a stellar recrue; I granted her the last available spot in my party to verify that hunch, and it turned out quite right indeed. Pandora is by far my party's strongest unit, delivering mighty blows like there's no tomorrow — and there is often none indeed for the foes that have the misfortune of being on the receiving end of her wrath. She herself doesn't have to worry about fatal blows, as she has the highest HP of all my party members and boasts excellent defense to boot. She's the perfect mixed attacker, with both physical and elemental Skills at her disposal; and whilst she's not blessed with as much MP as Cait Sith's, she still has more than enough to fire mighty Skills at bosses without running out. Honorable mentions: Here's a word for the Astrals that joined my party for a while, yet didn't stick around for various reasons — many are called, but few are chosen indeed! First, we have Will-o'-the-Wisp, whose elemental Skills came in handy in the early stages of my run yet had to go because it peaked too quickly, and Echidna, who showed potential yet sadly had to vacate the premises to make room for Cait Sith. We also have Baphomet, who was a fixture during the middle stages of my run and would still be there if not for his regrettable plateauing and lack of Skills. Last but not least, we have Tamamo-no-Mae, who showed promise on the elemental front yet had to go because of her frailty and her unfortunate tendency to get KOed in battle. They still lounge in my back party just in case, but my main crew is so magnificent that they virtually never get to step in.My mighty quintet's winning strategies are pretty much set by now. For random battles, I let them dispose of foes with regular blows, with a pinch of Enoch's Slice to get rid of full rows and a sprinkle of Cait Sith's Healing Wind if necessary. For boss battles, I start with Lua's Frontline Fortress for extra HP, followed by Healing Wind to fill up said extra HP and a Burst for good measure. Then, I let Enoch and Pandora wreak havoc on the boss' HP bar, whilst Cait Sith works his (de)buffing and healing skills, Hayato keeps himself poised for the next Burst and Lua does whatever fits the situation — heal, buff or deliver Lightning attacks. Granted, my elemental coverage could use a bit of polishing: two Fire Astrals are probably one too much, and whilst my party is pretty much covered on the Wind, Fire, Wood and Lightning fronts, it's still entirely lacking on the Water one. Still, I'm none too worried about this — all the less so as I actually had full coverage for a while, with Hayato wielding a Water weapon; however, it didn't change my battle fortunes that much. Guess I've reached a point where raw power matters more than elemental complementarities. As I'm writing this, Cait Sith gloriously towers over the party at Lv.99, whilst Enoch and Pandora proudly flaunt their Lv.85 — needless to say, they're all fully EVILved. Hayato and Lua boast a more modest Lv.45, which is still pretty decent considering their much slower leveling-up rate. I'm on my way to the final boss' lair, and I'm fully determined to clear TLC with my awesome, beloved Dream Team. I'll see you again when the deed is done, dear fellow gamers! Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Lost Child: The Dream Team, Part 1", "date": "03/02/2019", "text": "As I'm inching closer to the final boss' lair, the time is ripe to unveil my ultimate — in every sense of the word — party. I firmly intent to take down the final boss with that close-knit quintet or die trying: not only am I too attached to them now to let any of them go, but I invested so much Karma in them that I basically backed myself into a corner. Any new addition to my team at that point would require grinding for Karma, which I'm totally not in the mood to do.It should surprise no one that I dutifully stuck with the same Astrals for most of my run — a strategy that's pretty much the next best thing to a solo run in TLC. I actually toyed with the idea of crawling solely with Hayato and Lua at the very beginning; however, I quickly gave up when I realize that a) my hard-earned Karma would be wasted in the process, and b) the whole thing might well be darn near impossible. See, Hayato and Lua are actually quite weak: not only do they level up really slowly, but their stats are nothing to brag about, especially compared to those of a well-developed Astral. Their HP in particular is pitifully low, and certainly wouldn't allow them to survive most random battles, let alone dispose of bosses. They definitely fare much better in a full-party setting, as we'll see right now. Dear fellow gamers, let's kick off that presentation of my TLC Dream Team with its two mandatory fixtures, namely Hayato and Lua.Hayato: A.k.a. the Finisher. You'd think that being the resident Chosen One, Hayato would kick ass on the battlefied; however, it's not quite the case — at least at first. Even with his Attack on steroids and pimped-up weaponry, he does only marginally more damage than a well-raised Astral. His defense and HP are none too glorious either; and as he has 0 MP, he cannot learn nor wield Skills at all. He's more or less condemned to single hits for most of the main game due to his type of weaponry and lack of Skills, and it's pretty common to see him do pitifully little in boss battles compared to the rest of the crew. However, Hayato has a niche of its own as the sole wielder of the Gangour. Apart from capturing Astrals, the Gangour can be used to deliver mighty blows during fights — blows that can give you a seriously good edge, if not terminate the fight entirely. Hayato is very much a slow burner: it takes time and dedication to hunt for Bursts and bring him to his full potential, but it's totally worth the effort. Lua: A.k.a. the Jack-of-all-trades. And potentially master of none, indeed. Lua can fill different roles in a serviceable way; however, her versatility takes some time to fully reveal itself, and it must be wisely exploited if one wants to make the most of it. Lua learns Electric attacks, group buffs and healing spells; and whilst all those Skills can come in handy, it's pretty much mandatory to cherry-pick the ones you'll use in any given situation. The main issue stems from Lua's low MP, which prevents her from being all at once a Buffer, a Spellcaster and a Healer. Having Lua as the party's main Healer is an especially poor choice, because you can bet that she'll run out of MP before the end of the dungeon — or the boss fight, for that matter. I find that her limited MP is best used in group buffs and occasional status effect healing and resurrection, and thus focused primarily on raising her Attack — all the more so as, unlike Hayato, she can wield weaponry that target whole rows of enemies. Although Hayato and Lua are the titular MCs, they are definitely not the main stars in all things fighting. Instead, they are here to add the finishing touches and perfect the strategy du jour, whilst the Astrals are the ones who truly get to shine and wreak havoc on the battlefield. I'll see you soon for the second part on that post, where I'll gleefully expand on the sheer awesomeness of my very own trio of Astrals. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Lost Child: The nasty bits", "date": "31/01/2019", "text": "It should be abundantly clear by now that I love TLC to pieces; however, that intense love doesn't make me blind to the game's flaws. Whilst I'm tolerating TLC much better than some players out there, there are still a couple of things that rub me the wrong way; and here they are in all their unholy glory.  The 'Fruits of Wisdom' system: A.k.a. randomized skill acquisition. This is hands down TLC's biggest flaw, because it seriously hampers the player's ability to build a well-assorted party. Sure, it may seem innocuous at first, and even a bit entertaining: after all, what's more delightful than to suddenly gain a brand-new skill in the heat of battle? However, the cracks begin to show when one realizes that there is simply no reliable way to predict an Astral's growth in the Skill department beyond (wild) guesses based on said Astral's base set of skills and stats. Some Astrals learn only physical skills, some only elemental ones, some only buffs and healing spells, and others a mix of all that; some Astrals learn metric tons of skills (cue Enoch), whilst other learn very few (cue Baphomet). In practice, this means that every single Astral is pretty much a bet. You might pin your hopes on a brand-new Astral, only to realize after a couple of hours and scores of battles that they cannot learn the skills you want. Even worse, if one of your party members learns a skill and you lose your progress afterwards for any reason, there is no saying when — or even if — they'll learn it again. I've lost a good five skills so far, mostly due to intempestive crashes; and whilst three of them have popped up again, two seem to have been lost forever. The Spirit Reset: As the name implies, that feature allows you to reset an Astral's level to 1 in order to gain a massive stat boost. Sounds neat and nifty, right? But wait, there's a catch: Spirit Reset also wipes out all the involved Astral's skills in the process. Combine this with the Fruits of Wisdom system, and you get a giant hassle and a monumental display of fake longevity. How many battles could it take before your Astrals regain all their skills? In my opinion, far too many to justify resetting any of mine. Although to be fair, that particular criticism is to be taken with a pinch of salt: Spirit Reset seems to be designed especially for those who want to conquer R'lyeh Road, the game's cut-throat 99-floor complimentary dungeon. If you take up that gauntlet in the first place, I guess you won't mind grinding for hours on end, now will you? No instant save: Given how crucial mapping is in FPDCs, you'd think that instant save would be a fixture in the genre by now. Yet it's not, and it's a royal pain. Having to retread previously cleared ground after a Game Over/random freeze (insert murderous eyes) just so that it'll show on the map is not challenging, it's just tedious and a complete loss of time.Pointless monster drops: Apart from the occasional potion, most of the monster drops are random items with fancy names. You never get to see what they look like, nor do you get to use them in any kind of synthesis; their sole purpose is to be sold for cold, hard cash. Fair enough; but in that case, why can't I get the cash directly from the monsters and dispense with the selling part? Sure, one might argue that it wouldn't make sense for monsters to roam around with monies; however, they do roam around with stuff called 'medals', 'gems' and 'coins', which is just as implausible. Just gimme the cash and spare me the trip to Leon's store every time I come back from a dungeon, thank you.I hesitated about putting the random crashing issue here as well; however, I finally decided against it, as I've found no mention whatsoever of that particular problem on the internet. This means that it could be restricted to my own version, maybe because of an incompatibility between the software and my Vita's OS or memory card. At any rate, I hope that the upcoming physical release will be free of any freezing issue. And with that, dear fellow gamers, I'm done with my pet peeves with TLC. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Lost Child: A smorgasbord of goodness", "date": "26/01/2019", "text": "I'm so engrossed in my run of The Lost Child that I somehow cannot find the time to write about it. I have to, though — if only to let my fellow FPDC aficionados know that this game is dope, and very much worth a purchase and a playthrough indeed. Without further ado, here's a (non-exhaustive) list of the things TLC nailed perfectly. The fighting system: Granted, there's not a shred of originality to be found in TLC's fighting system — bar maybe the fact that skill acquisition is random, which could actually be seen as a bit of a flaw. This is typical turn-based fare, with your usual element complementaries, skillsets, classes and the like; yet what that system lacks in originality, it makes up for in sheer depth. To put it simply, TLC totally lets you fight it your way. Want to bulldoze your way through by focusing on a few monsters and molding them into war horses? You can! Want to fine-tune your strategies to the fullest by swapping monsters on the fly and cherry-picking the perfect ones for the fight du jour? You can too! Want to do a bit of both? Why, you can as well! TLC comes with all the necessary tools to humour every fighting style, from the most mindlessly brutal to the most subtly strategic. The dungeon crawling: Let's face it, TLC's dungeons are not exactly pretty. However, they are incredibly well-designed: they boast just the right length to be engrossing without wearing you out, their layouts are stimulating without being over-complicated, and they offer genuinely clever puzzles that still remain fair and solvable without running to an FAQ. Add to this a perfectly balanced encounter rate, neither annoyingly high nor boringly low, and you get some pure dungeon-crawly goodness. As a matter of fact, TLC's small yet wholesome roster of dungeons delivers one of the best first-person crawling experience I've had since I started indulging in the genre. The sidequests: Dungeon crawlers usually don't lend themselves well to sidequests of the breather type, and that's kinda understandable: indeed, what could a dungeon crawler offer in the way of diversion, apart from even more crawling? TLC acknowledges that hurdle and tries its hardest to work around it, by streamlining its sidequests and offering great incentives for clearing them — and holy cow, does it succeed indeed. Not only are TLC's sidequests short and sweet, consisting often solely in beating a boss that kindly stands a couple of rooms away from the dungeon's entrance, but they deliver genuinely useful rewards for a change. Those rewards are none other than powerful special attacks to be used in battles, as well as complimentary gameplay features that can make your life as a TLC player genuinely better. The beauty of it all is that whilst none of these perks are truly necessary to play the game, they still make enough of a difference to justify hunting for them.The overall balance: TLC manages to create a flawless and wholesome loop between its resources and gameplay features. Fighting trash mobs grants you loot and so-called Karma; the former can be sold for money, whilst the latter can be used to level up captured monsters. Money can then be used to strengthen your weapons, buff yourself up before entering dungeons or transforming useless monsters into Karma, which can then be reinvested in better monsters — all this to make your party stronger and allow you to fight more efficiently, get more loot and Karma, and so on. Nothing's wasted in this gorgeous display of self-sufficiency, and the game delivers just the pitch-perfect amount of loot and Karma: you probably won't ever have to farm if you manage those resources cleverly, but neither will you be swimming in them. I just passed the 30-hour mark, and I can feel I'm heading towards the end. I'm certainly not done at all with writing about TLC, though; and I'll see you later with more posts about that game's sheer awesomeness. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "London Detective Mysteria: The route report", "date": "22/01/2019", "text": "I finally decided to write a report of the five \"good\" romantic endings I managed to clear. Follow me down LDM's murky maze of love entanglements, dear fellow gamers! (Massive spoilers ahead!)Holmes: Young Holmes' route, derivative is thy name. It's simply impossible to play that route and enjoy it on its own merits after playing Code:Realize, which stars the exact same protagonists in the exact same relationships. Sure, it's not Karin's fault that Sir Conan Doyle's and Maurice Leblanc's works do feature Holmes' friendship with Watson and rivalvry with Lupin, and it's even less their fault that Code:Realize treaded that exact same ground with much more success; but with Otomate's input being the most popular otome take on the Sherlock Holmes lore, Karin's version comes across as a sorry retread despite actually predating Otomate's one by a full year. To make matters worse, Karin's Holmes is rather milquetoast, he gets his thunder stolen by pretty much everybody around him (starting with his own father, the much more charismatic and bonkable Holmes Sr.) and his relationship with Emily never fully takes flight. Even if you choose to ignore the class difference factor, those two people seem to sap each other rather than strengthen each other. Heck, I can totally see them drift apart as soon as the physical passion cools down and end up getting on each other's nerves.Lupin: Described by many LDM players as the best route in the game, the gentleman thief's route left me cold. I see it as a giant missed opportunity, with the dichotomy between flamboyant Lupin and shy Lupine being painfully underexploited. The writers could have expanded upon Lupin's inner struggles and made him a genuinely conflicted character, torn between his father's expectations of him and his own desire to live a normal, thievery-free life; instead, they went the easy way by making Lupine a sheer decoy, nullifying his whole character in the process. Not that the romance itself is any better, mind you. First, you have that nude scene, which is both weirdly raunchy and utterly implausible in the story's context. No matter how horny Emily is as a healthy teenage girl, there's no way she would enjoy suddenly finding herself buck-naked in the arms of a guy she hardly knows; more like she'd get utterly hysterical — this is Victorian era England, after all. And then you have the teeny-tiny issue of Lupin being a giant prick who spends his whole route blowing hot and cold and toying with Emily's heart. How am I supposed to root for that pair in earnest, when Emily herself calls Lupin out for being sleazy and manipulative? She'll probably toss him out once she gets bored of his scheming ways, or beauty-obsessed Lupin himself will ditch her for a prettier dame.Akechi: Unlike his two predecessors in this post, Akechi is blessed with a truly fascinating personality and stellar character development. His route is rife with mystery and action, including (but not limited to) a bout of confinement, a duel under the moonlight and a boat travel overseas. Cherry on the top, his whole arc touches upon genuinely interesting and occasionally heart-wrenching topics, from the hardships of being an expatriate to the sacrifices one must make to protect others. What a pity, then, to see l'amour fail utterly in that otherwise brilliant route! With Emily and Akechi both being loyal and serious characters and having unescapable duties to fulfill in different continents, there is simply no way their budding love story can endure. The game itself doesn't even try to give us a glimmer of hope regarding their future together, preferring instead to describe in exquisite details the many differences between them and the countless obstacles that keep them apart. This is a different brand of depressing: Lupin and Holmes' routes give us poorly assorted couples that can be together, while Akechi's route gives us a well-assorted couple that cannot be together. Oh, the torture! Unless they can make do with bonking each other once a year, their relationship is pretty much over before the credits even roll.Jack: If you can stomach all the gore and grime packed by this route, you're in for a touching and bittersweet love story that's marginally more believable than the ones above. Jack is a tainted character through and through and the biggest roturier in the whole game, which should automatically disqualify him as a love interest for pure, noble Emily; and yet, their common history beautifully illustrates how the noble and low classes can learn from each other and help each other. There is something weirdly poignant in Jack's rebirth as Emily's butler: this feels like the most torturous situation ever, and yet one cannot help but think that this is exactly the atonement Jack deserves for his crimes. With the game firmly implying that Pendleton was once Emily's late mother's very own Jack, we can only hope that Jack himself will grow into as badass a butler as Pendleton. On the other hand, there seems to be little hope as far as romance is concerned, with Jack's sole prospect being to love Emily from the shadows for the rest of his life. There's not even the slightest guarantee that the lady will be able to return that love at all; although Emily claims that she'll stay single forever for Jack's sake, that cute youthful resolve probably won't last long in the face of House duties, desire for offspring and the like. Watson: It's hard not to see the apprentice doctor as Emily's canon mate. Not only do they interact an awful lot during the common route, but they genuinely care for each other and don't mind showing it. To crown this all, they met once during their childhood — although only Watson remembers it. Their love story has 'fate' written all over it and is deliciously heart-warming; what a pity, then, to see that sweet love story unfold in what is arguably the weakest route in the whole game! Most of Watson's route consists of unplausible events and out-of-character behaviours: like, why the heck would Emily foolishly follow Watson alone in the East End after she was nearly attacked there once? Why would Watson avoid Emily for days on end after they developed such a close relationship? To create fake drama and fill in the blanks, of course! After all the fulfilling interactions between Watson and Emily in the common route, their dedicated romantic route somewhat feels like filler, which is the most pitifully ironic thing ever. Very little is said about their future romantic prospects, but I guess their situation is the least desperate here: not only is their love genuinely strong, but Watson has the potential to become a talented doctor and thus a palatable mate for Emily. Sure, that still wouldn't make him nobility; but a doctor would still be a better potential husband for a lady than, say, a thief or a murderer.LDM was not an unpleasant ride, but let's face it: I got more enjoyment out of the lovely art, the gorgeous music, the beautifully written text and the constant mentions of tea than out of the story and the romance. I toyed with the idea of purchasing the original PSP version at the beginning of my run, but nothing could be further from my mind now. Will I ever pick up LDM again and clear the rest of the routes, only time will tell! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Lost Child: What to expect", "date": "18/01/2019", "text": "2017's The Lost Child was one of the very last first-person dungeon crawler released on the Vita; and as a physical version is heading towards our shores (insert eyes teary with gratefulness), I had to check out somehow if it was worth a purchase. Normally, the mere fact that we're talking about a FPDC should have been enough to warrant a purchase of the \"Shut up and take my money\" sort; but in that particular case, I have to admit that the reviews somewhat confused me. With scores ranging from 81 to 50 and reviewers describing the game as a host of different (and sometimes conflicting) things, I had my doubts about TLC. Was it a tedious monstrosity mix of VN and dungeon-crawling à la Ray Gigant, as some reviews seemed to imply? Or was it a more classic FPDC with bits of storytelling in between? I had to check before commiting to a physical purchase; and lucky me, the PSN January sales were in the mood to humour me. TLC was here for the taking for a very cheap price, and that's how I unexpectedly found myself playing it — and loving it very much indeed. But more on that later; for now, let's shed a welcome light on what TLC is — and isn't.It's not a visual novel: No matter what some reviews seem to imply, TLC cannot be described as a VN by any stretch of the imagination. Sure, there are some story-telling segments; but they are mercifully short, and few and far between to boot. Oh, and did I mention that the story is painfully erratic and makes little sense? Anybody who's in for a narrative treat should wisely abstain from coming close to TLC. On the other hand, all my fellow crawlers are more than welcome, as TLC's story-telling doesn't detract in any way from its (excellent) dungeon crawling.It's derivative as heck: Nearly every feature and gameplay mechanic in TLC has been done before and is bound to remind you of another game or franchise. Its main feature, the monster-collecting and evolving thing, vigorously screams Pokemon; and some have even compared TLC to the Shin Megami Tensei series. I cannot comment on that supposed resemblance since I have yet to play a MegaTen game, but let me tell you this: if the Shin Megami Tensei series is anything like TLC, then I'm most certainly gonna have the time of my life when I finally play it, oooh yes precious.Ia! Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The white goat with a thousand teeth! It's definitely not a piece of Lovecraftian fanfiction: And that's all for the best, really. Lovecraft's creations were always designed as entities far beyond the scope of our pitifully limited human perception, and there's no way a mere budget dungeon crawler could have done them justice. The Lovecraft references in TLC are just as derivative as anything else in the game, being but a couple of names slapped on monsters, bosses, NPCs and whatnot; they could be seen as an homage at best — and as a shameless display of creative laziness at worst. As a matter of fact, they are far from being the only blatant source of inspiration here, as the game gaily and shamelessly pilfers names from religions, mythologies, legends, and whatever else the writers happened to fancy. It's a total grindfest: It starts innocuously enough, with a forgiving encounter rate and quick battles; but before the end of the third dungeon, you'll be facing packages of 5 to 10 enemies on a regular basis. You cannot shy away from random encounters too often if you want to exploit your monster foils' full potential, given that they learn new skills solely in battle and level up through the use of resident resources obtained by killing trash mobs. And since backtracking is part and parcel of the roaming due to the dungeons' design and the absence of an instant save feature, that means even more grinding along the way. It's really not optimized: I think this is the first time I encounter a FPDC that requires load times when entering dungeons and between dungeon floors. Not just load times, but very long load times. Text is ridiculously tiny and sometimes skips before you can read it, regardless of the selected text speed. More embarrassing is the game's unfortunate tendency to crash randomly, with my own version freezing on me a good five times since the beginning of my run — with collateral losses of good progression involved, as you'd expect. I can only hope that the upcoming physical version will alleviate those issues. It's unabashedly old-fashioned: Let's face it, TLC is more Wizardry than Dungeon Travelers. Not only does it shamelessly dispense with player-friendly features such as instant save and warp points, but it makes no effort to charm the player's senses. TLC's dungeons are austere to a fault, with a bleakness pretty typical of old-school FPDCs — and so are its soundtrack and its character and enemy designs. The whole art style is highly reminiscent of '90s manga — early Bastard!, Psychometer Eiji and the like — and the dungeon themes are atmospheric and brooding pieces à la Ecco the Dolphin. This is a game that doesn't try to woo the player and draw them in, but rather dares said player to conquer it — and learn to love it while doing so.In a nutshell, TLC doesn't try to be anything more than a serviceable FPDC for aficionados of the genre. It doesn't bring anything new to the table, but it does everything right nonetheless and delivers good, robust dungeon crawling by the truckload. I already have 18 hours of TLC under my belt, and I'm nowhere near finished with that game indeed. See you soon for more TLC goodness, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "London Detective Mysteria: Not my cup of tea, dear", "date": "14/01/2019", "text": "Playing London Detective Mysteria filled me with newfound respect for Otomate. Sure, their stories are sometimes utter piles of horse manure, and I roughed them up more than once on this very blog; however, when it comes to gameplay, Otomate offerings boast a sheer accessibility that other developers such as Karin can only dream of. Otomate games have everything nicely streamlined, to the point where even complete otome noobs like me can land the good endings and unearth the true route without fail. Which, oh dear, is so not the case in LDM. LDM's gameplay suffers from a painful lack of clarity and readability. There are just too many systems at work: a bit of flag system here, an affection gauge there, branching paths left and right, a hidden 'detective gauge' in the corner, timed choices sprinkled on top — and a throroughly confused player in the end. Because of all these conflicting features, it's extremely difficult to pinpoint the requirements for a given ending. You'd think that zeroing in on a given beau to get locked on their route and then being more or less nice to them would land you the whole range of romantic endings, but that's not the case: you also need to factor in the detective gauge, and maybe one or two flags as well. Weirdly enough, bad romantic endings are actually harder to land than good ones; and don't get me started on the non-romantic routes, whose requirements are even more impossibly arcane. Mind you, the fact that most endings play so hard to get wouldn't be an issue, if not for the fact that viewing pretty much all of them is required to unlock the True Ending. Since I gave up after uncovering the five good romantic endings, I cannot say if going through all these loops is ultimately worth it.This segues nicely into the next point, namely LDM's story. I'd like to say that all things narrative are that game's saving grace; but alas, it's not the case. (Spoilers!) I could expand on the tone shift issue, which sees the story go from light-hearted comedy to gritty noir in a matter of chapters; but that's far from being my biggest problem here. Said biggest problem would be the sheer unlikelihood of the romantic entanglements, which defeats the very purpose of that game being an otome rather than a mere VN. Ironically enough, that very issue stems from something that could be seen as positive, namely MC Emily's very developed character. The game goes to great lengths to give her a depth properly unseen in the genre, and utterly succeeds; and that succeed turns out to be l'amour's downfall. Emily is no mere placeholder for the player indeed: she's a noblewoman with duties aplenty and a grisly past to deal with. Not only does she seem almost too busy to fool around, but the fact that she's determined to become the head of her house in a near future and do a great job at it obliterates all her possible relationships with the game's beaus, whose extraction is certainly not noble enough to court a lady. The power imbalance between Emily and the boys is so massive that jaded old me cannot see those relationships last, let alone flourish; and that's a tad depressing to be served with love stories that are so obviously bound to fail. (End of spoilers)So I'll take my french leave and drop LMD for the time being — and maybe forever, because let's face it: my initially warm feelings for that game have sadly grown cold. Sure, it has really pretty colours and gorgeous art; but so do many VNs with better stories in my precious collection. I may write a route report if I feel like it, but no promises here. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Psycho-Pass - Mandatory Happiness: A lovely discovery", "date": "10/01/2019", "text": "Dear fellow gamers, let me introduce you to the first contender in the 'Let's polish off all those digital Vita games before I lose interest in them' sessions! (Which games will still stand in the end, no one knows.) To say that I had low expectations regarding Psycho-Pass would be the understatement of the week: not only are reviews for that game far from dripping with praise, but it's part of a greater franchise that started with an anime — which means that it had the potential to be derivative as heck and incomplete unless one watches the anime in question. Heck, I would never even had purchased it, if not for its current ridiculously low price tag on the PSN. How delightful, then, to be pleasantly surprised by that game and end up loving it in earnest! Here's how PP managed to win my jaded gamer's heart:It's short! All too often, VNs simply cannot tell a story in a concise and elegant way. From Chaos;Child to Code:Realize, many overstay their welcome, dragging every single scene and stuffing them with useless dialogue and descriptions until the poor reader screams for mercy. This is exactly what PP abstains from doing, choosing instead to go straight to the point and telling a short, sharp and slick story. One evening is more than enough to clear a run of PP, which makes the prospect of experimenting with it and hunting every single one of its many endings much less daunting than in your average VN with a 15-hour long reading time. It's sober! With its subdued art style and colour palette, PP visibly aims for an older audience than your average VN. There is no trace of kawaisa in the character design, and your usual anime tropes are nowhere to be found; instead, we are treated to a cast of complex and relatable characters, whose relationships and modi operandi are pleasantly realistic. No power of friendship or going to the end of the world for the sake of a pretty face here! As PP's two MCs, we face dilemmas and quandaries on a regular basis; and like in most real-life dilemmas and quandaries, we have to make a decision alone — and face the consequences of said decision alone as well, as the game wisely abstains from taking a moral stance towards its own world or firing deus ex machinas left and right. It's efficient! PP might be short, but it does an amazing job at telling its story nonetheless. This is in no small part due to the fact that unlike many VNs, PP doesn't clumsily separate action and exposition, forcing us to endure the latter before launching into the former. Both are one and the same here: we get to know the crew through their reactions to the story's events, and we take in the stakes at work and soak up the atmosphere through those same events. It's also worth noting that there are absolutely no fillers, every line of dialogue and every narrative development being meaningful. Last but not least, we players get to enjoy plenty of agency through the game's many choices and branching paths: forget about being just a reader, this is a true Choose Your Own Adventure VN we have here.I played a single run and got the \"Symbol of Faith\" ending; and although I still have to uncover a metric ton of routes, I'm not gonna play more PP for the time being. My run left me fully sated, in the most positive fashion:  I loved everything about PP, and it left me with unabashedly positive feelings — and very willing to purchase its physical edition indeed. Here's to one digital game taken care of — and possibly one new recrue in my precious collection! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "New Gaming Year!", "date": "08/01/2019", "text": "Happy New Year 2019, dear fellow gamers! Hope you had the nicest Christmas holidays, full of lovely moments with your loved ones and scrumptious food. I certainly got my share of both; so much so, in fact, that I didn't put a single finger on my precious handhelds for the last three weeks, so busy was I enjoying that whole Christmas indulgence.But now that everybody is back home, it's time to get back to the daily grinding! I don't have that many gaming plans lined up for 2019, though: as the 3DS and Vita are slowly but surely retreating from the current gaming scene, my collecting prospects are drying up, leaving me sad and relieved at once. But I'll expand on my inner game collector in a dedicated post; for now, let's stay on my gaming plans for 2019. Apart from following my ever-dependable gaming instinct wherever it may lead me, there is one thing I really want to achieve this year, and that would be to play all my digital Vita games. Those games feel less and less important and worth playing as time goes on, no doubt due to their, erm, intangible quality; I'll probably soon reach a point where I just don't care anymore, and I'd rather give them a fair chance before it happens. This is all a matter of recouping my investment, and hopefully also unearthing a couple of gems worth a physical purchase in the process — just like my beloved Pandora's Reflection, whose japanese physical edition joined my precious collection lately after I played the digital version and fell in love with it one year ago.  So there you have it, dear fellow gamers: a teeny-tiny bit of collecting here and there and lots of (hopefully) fullfilling playing, that's what 2019 is shaping up to be. Feel free to share your own gaming plans for this year in the comment section; and as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},

{"title": "Code Realize - Future Blessings: The route report", "date": "14/12/2018", "text": "Here's my short and sweet report of Future Blessings' eight routes and stories, dear fellow gamers. Without further ado, let's go for it! (Spoilers ahead!)The Sequel RoutesThose routes are incredibly short, but they all have one redeeming quality: they offer various solutions to Cardia's poison issue, allowing the lady and her beau du jour to enjoy physical intimacy — probably for all eternity, since all those routes also imply a wedding to come.— Saint-Germain: After all the gloom and doom of Saint-Germain's route in Guardian of Rebirth, we get treated to a light-hearted route that fully shows Saint-Germain's kind and, dare I say, human side. Given his backstory, it's all too easy to treat the Count as a supernatural being of sorts; but the truth is that he started out his life as a human, and he remains a human despite his extraordinary longevity. His sequel route gives a welcome insight into his psyche and some of his relationships prior to meeting Cardia and the gang, and treats us to a really touching ending. Needless to say, I like Saint-Germain's arc much more after playing that route.— Van Helsing: It seems that after painting Van Helsing as the resident douche in the original game, the writers wanted to show a softer side of him; that's how we end up with a route featuring an insecure, shy vampire hunter who frets and agonizes about how to convey his overflowing love for Cardia. The whole thing is quite consistent with Van Helsing's angsty personality, while still managing to be genuinely unexpected and surprising. I would lie if I said that I liked Van H's arc, but I have to admit that his sequel route redeems his character quite a fair bit. I only have one pet peeve with the guy: his darn glasses, which are way too feminine. Combined with his too-stylish haircut, those glasses make him look more like an butchy middle-aged secretary than like the 'human weapon' he's supposed to be. — Impey: The crew's resident goof gets a lovely ending, rife with adventure and sweet, sweet romance. The writers keep weaving the whole Jules Verne thread, taking a page from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea and sending the young couple straight into deep sea exploration. Impey is more mature and assertive while still keeping his youthful, enthusiastic side; add to this an unexpected yet welcome bit of expertly handled steaminess, and you get much deeper and better character than the one we got to know and not necessarily love in the original game. — Lupin: The gentleman thief's route is quite inconsistent — just like his whole arc in the series, really. It starts as a funny and playful romp, in which a pouty and mischievous Cardia tries to find a way to throw her all-too-confident lover off balance and make him blush and feel embarrassed. The whole endeavour half-succeeds, after which the tone gets all serious as Cardia muses about what kind of person her father used to be when he was still human and sane. The route then turns into a clumsy attempt to rehabilitate the late Isaac Beckford — which, then again, only half-succeeds. Lupin's route, half-baked is thy name.— Victor: In my opinion, Victor's arc was just perfect as it was. The original game gave us tons of sweet romance as well as a fulfilling conclusion; there was really nothing to add, and the writers themselves probably realized this. But since they had to come up with those sequel routes for FB, they pulled out the whole Idea thing out of their hat and served us that heavy-duty, dramatic story in which Cardia's Horologium remains a ticking time bomb and the happy new couple must face the dire prospect of being separated sooner or later, with Cardia dying in the process. Hey, how do you like your honeymoon now? Still, Victor's route always had that bittersweet tone to it, and those new developments could be seen as a natural extension to GoR's events; that is, if said developments didn't house the biggest plothole of the whole game. The issue is: why is Cardia's existence considered a deadly threat only in Victor's route? There is nothing specific to Victor's route or to his love story with Cardia that justifies Idea's fears: the crux of the matter is that Cardia's Horologium is not fully neutered and that Victor, who provides the means to neuter it temporarily, will not be around forever to do so. Fair and nice; but this situation arises in all routes, not just Victor's one; so why the heck does Idea pop up solely in his route? Or do they try to recruit him in all routes, unbeknownst to us players? If that's the case, why do they leave Cardia off the hook? And why on earth would Victor spend potential eons brewing medecine for a woman he doesn't even get to bonk? If anything, Idea should appear in all routes but Victor's: it's pretty obvious that if he's with her, he's gonna try his hardest to heal her; on the other hand, if she's with another beau, life and circumstances will keep them apart and he's just not gonna try as hard. This whole situation is a big fat plothole and nothing else, full stop. I'll keep Victor's perfect route in GoR and treat that sorry sequel as non-canon. The brand-new stuff: — Shirley's Story: This is by far the longest story in that sequel, and it's an obvious attempt to give Cardia a female friend and craft a heart-pounding adventure around it. The whole thing kinda fails, mostly because of poor writing. Cardia and new girl Shirley become friends a mere two hours after meeting, after which their friendship is taken for granted and never questioned again. That instant bond would be marginally fine if the rest of the story were solid, which is unfortunately not the case. First, the featured mafia clan is as unconvincing as it gets: what kind of mafia doesn't kill anyone and refuses to dabble in drug trafficking? The writers themselves probably realized that the whole thing sounded unrealistic, because they tried to rebrand the clan as 'vigilantes' of sorts halfway through the story. Too little, too late, I'm afraid. Then, Lupin's crew demonstrate their whole range of superhuman and utterly ah hoc abilities; but that's pretty much business as usual, so I'll let that slip. What I cannot let slip is the fact that the big baddie, who killed hundreds of innocent citizens and was ready to flood Britain under a lethal drug, turns out to be evil because of a childhood trauma, after which he's nearly instantly forgiven. The fact that he's killed off-camera in some kind of freak accident, just so that Shirley won't dirty her pure white hands killing him in a bout of revenge, doesn't sit well with me either. That whole story is weak and unsatisfying, and it brings little to nothing to the Code Realize lore — all the less so as that precious friend of Cardia was never mentioned in GoR's story and is never mentioned again in the sequel routes. — Holmes' Route: This is probably the most derivative, 'fanfic-y' route in the whole game: not only do we get Sherlock and his foil Dr. Watson, but we also get Moriarty and the Reichenbach Falls, all things canon in the universe created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It's extremely hard to play that route without making constant associations with the BBC's Sherlock; Cumberbatch's and Freeman's faces popped up in my head every now and then as I played, and that's with me never having watched a single episode of the series. Good luck playing that route without mental interferences if you're a hardcore fan of the whole thing. Apart from that, Holmes comes across as a bit flat; I'd wager that this is mostly due to the toning down of his character, with the writers getting rid of such otome-unfriendly idiosyncracies as Holmes' drug habit and antisocial behaviours. The shortness of the route, combined with the fact that Holmes is a mere supporting character that we don't get to know that much in GoR, probably also plays a part in making Holmes the most transparent and unconvincing of all the Code Realize beaus. —Finis' Route: A fascinating and engrossing route, if only because it's non-romantic and features a brother and sister pair that don't end up cavorting with each other. Well, I guess Otomate adverted their own tropes pretty neatly with that one, now didn't they? Of course, Finis' route remains an Otomate creation through and through: not only is it FB's trademark confinement route, but it's rife with drama, despair and denial. Oh, the thrill! Getting Finis back from the brink of insanity and saving him from his own masochism is no small feat indeed, and the route kept me on my toes until the very end. It's pretty much a perfect route in my book; and although the game describes it as a story that \"could have been\", I'd be tempted to view it as the canon of all canons as far as Code Realize's overall story is concerned. I mean, Cardia can easily hook up with any of the beaus after she's done rescuing her dear brother, right? My only pet peeve with that route is the fact that Finis never changes his haircut or outfit, even after being rescued by Cardia. Sure, the other characters don't do that either; but their outfits and hairdos are more normal, while Finis' whole style is utterly bizarre and unpractical. I would have loved to see him without his Princess Leia-buns and his corset thing, if only in the ending sequence.—The Delacroix Skits: This is not really a route, just a collection of sweet little scenes that are often more humorous that anything else; and yet, it's unmistakably romantic in nature, if only in a veiled way. I mean, there is no mistaking Delacroix's blush when he realizes that his head is resting on Cardia's tighs, and there is even less mistaking Cardia's intentions when she starts imagining a handsome adult Delacroix playing around with a kid that sports the exact same hair colour as herself. Only time will tell if a full-blown Delacroix route becomes a thing; but if it does, I'd wager that the vampire king could become a new fan favourite in a flash. There you have it, dear fellow gamers: my whole route report for Future Blessings. Gee, I probably spent as much time writing that report as I did playing the game! Now, will I succumb again to the lure of the Code Realize fandisc and purchase Wintertide Miracles in early 2019? Only time will tell! Until then, dear fellow gamers, a million thanks for reading as usual, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Code Realize - Future Blessings: Sweet nothings", "date": "04/12/2018", "text": "I wasn't initially planning to purchase Code Realize's sequel/fan disk, because: a) this is far from being my favourite series under the VN sun, and b) it was said to be short and thus not worth its 40-bucks price tag. But then came the Black Friday sales on the PSN, and Future Blessings was granted a massive 50% discount; and since I was in the mood for careless spending and VN action at the time, I caved in and purchased it.My verdict: FB is most definitely short, and pretty light on content. However, that is not the game's main issue; that main issue would be how utterly pointless and redundant most of said content is. Without spoiling anything, what we have here is:— Five sequel stories involving the beaus from Guardian of Rebirth. Those stories are painfully short, and definitely not meaty enough to leave a lasting impact. They really should have been included in the original game, if only to provide a sense of closure that was sorely missing in most of said original game's routes. — Two brand-new romantic routes involving characters that were not dateable in GoR. Those routes are pleasant enough, and one of them comes close to single-handedly justifying the purchase of the whole game. If the game came with a 10 bucks price tag, that is.— One exclusive side story taking place during the events of GoR. Probably the weakest link here: despite the writers' best intentions, this side story comes across as asinine, pointless, and poorly written to boot. It's also ridiculously derivative: it feels like a fanfiction of GoR, which is itself very much a giant crossover fanfiction.— A set of semi-romantic skits involving a non-dateable character from GoR. Oh, such wasted potential! Those skits could have become an epic romantic route, if only the writers had bothered developing the whole thing. Instead, they merely give us a teaser and let us imagine what might happen. Or is it rather a trailer, alluding to a future route in yet another Code Realize fandisc? At any rate, it's a cheap move. A frustrating cheap move.If you read my last post about GoR, dear fellow gamers, you may remember that I had a whole list of things I wanted to see in the sequel. Now, was my wish Otomate's command? Well, it was indeed! Granted, I didn't get everything I wanted; however, I definitely got more than I dared hope for. (Spoilers!) I got my Leonhardt x Victoria love story, with the sequel routes firmly implying a greater intimacy between the pair; I got my Finis route, not romantic but still full of love; and I got the next best thing to a Delacroix route. The only wish of mine that wasn't fulfilled was an Aleister route; but I guess that hooking Cardia up with a psychopath old enough to be her (grand)father was a bridge too far, even for Otomate. (End of spoilers.)All in all, Future Blessings is a bit of a rip-off, even with a 20-bucks price tag. It was not unpleasant by any means, but it's definitely not juicy and solid enough to justify a purchase unless you're a hardcore fan of the series. I strongly feel that Otomate is trying to milk the series as much as possible by withholding important developments and then delivering them in sequels. Guardian of Rebirth is not a self-contained game: if you want a fulfilling conclusion to that game's routes, you need to purchase Future Blessings. Now, do you want a fulfilling conclusion to Future Blessings' brand-new routes? By all means, please purchase Wintertide Miracles, the second Code Realize fan disc! I swear, Otomate is just ruthless. (And I may just cave in in the end and purchase WM indeed, if only because I'm a sucker for wintery settings.) Having said that, I'll see you soon with my route report, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Avalon Code: My own private cult classic", "date": "30/11/2018", "text": "I've been replaying Avalon Code lately, for the 15th-or-so time. This game is an absolute cult classic of mine: I played it first in late 2013, racking up seven playthroughs in a row for a total of 150 hours; and I've been playing it on-and-off since then, which probably makes my global tally of played hours a good 300 and counting. Avalon Code is even to thank for the existence of that very blog, which I started in no small part due to my desire to convey my burning passion for that game. Of course, years and runs have changed my vision of Avalon Code. It's still very much a cult classic of mine, but I'm not as crazy in love with it as I used to be back in the days. Some things have gotten worse with time, such as the entire second half of the game: while said second half was a feverish, desperate race to regain what was lost during my very first playthrough, it feels more and more like a fake longevity-infused trudge as runs go on. This is not surprising, though: the impact of the devastating event that takes place at the halfway mark is bound to diminish as one replays the game and knows what to expect, exposing the game's second half as the poorly designed rehash of the first half it is. Nowadays, I don't always bother replaying said second half, preferring instead to give up after the Tournament and the love confession — if I get one, that is.And since I'm mentioning love confessions, romance is another feature that kinda lost its shine with time. I still like the overall romancing process very much, with its simple and no-fuss mechanics and its varying outcomes depending on when you start wooing sweethearts; however, I really cannot say as much about, well, the sweethearts themselves. More specifically, the huge quality gap between the male and female romance material. While the beaus are complex characters with shades and rich backstories, the belles are deep-as-puddle one-trick ponies. Duran is a coward haunted by guilt, who tries his hardest to overcome its crippling weakness; Fana, on the other hand, is just a sweet sick girl who spends her days in bed. Anwar is a cold loner who slowly warms up to human affection; Sylphy, his female counterpart in the 'ice queen' department, is a snotty elf who does little else than bitch about how weak human ares. (Granted, she gets to mature a bit, but only if you tackle her personal side quest; Anwar, on the other hand, evolves no matter what.)To make matters worse, the belles hardly take part in the overarching story beyond a few cameos here and there, while the beaus are all over the place all the way to the end. Say goodbye to Sylphy, Dorothea, Lauca Meia and Fana once you're done meeting them for the first time, because you won't see them again unless you actively look for them. The only belle that manages to avoid that sad wallflower destiny is Nanai, who is graced with a complex personality and touching backstory on top of playing an important role in the story — which is probably the reason I always end up as her (barely-legal-and-maybe-not-even) mate when I play with the male avatar. Either the writers thought that male players would be fine with just a pretty face to woo, or the romance options for the male avatar were added as an afterthought; at any rate, this lack of depth on the belle side is really frustrating. Not all is gloom and doom, fortunately: some things have gotten genuinely better with time. Arranging codes is getting easier by the playthrough, because I remember better and better where to find the codes I want. Fighting, I could do with my hands tied behind my back, as well as solving dungeon puzzles and finding secret spots on the map sections. Overall, each playthrough is getting smoother thanks to my ever-growing mastery of the game; and since I went platinum during my very first playthrough, finding every single item, fulfilling every single side quest and generally doing everything that was possible, I'm now free of the completion pressure and can play for as long or as little as I want, as superficially or extensively as I want. And I love that.So indeed, this is not the last time I play Avalon Code. As for writing about it, well... There are sure a couple of subjects I haven't covered yet in my posts about that game, such as the aforementioned romance; so there's definitely some untapped potential when it comes to writing about that personal cult classic of mine. Only time will tell if more tidings of Avalon Code come your way, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Labyrinth of Refrain Demo: Second helping, please!!! ", "date": "25/11/2018", "text": "And third, fourth and fifth, for that matter. It should surprise absolutely no one that I love that game to pieces. I mean, we're talking about a first-person dungeon crawler here; so it's absolutely not surprising that I spent six hours straight playing the demo and that I let out a genuine cry of dismay when the message notifying me that said demo was over popped up on my Switch's screen.Those six hours were spent exploring and roaming a mere three floors, and not entirely at that; this makes me think that LoR has the potential to be a FPDC of massive proportions. Also, the fact that I didn't feel a shred of boredom during those six hours spent on a mere three floors makes me think that LoR has the potential to be a very engrossing FPDC indeed. In fact, I don't just think that: I know it. No other FPDC I've played boasts such a perfect balance between exploration, team building, farming and combat, making for an incredibly addictive gameplay experience.— Exploration: Oh, the thrill! Complex and stimulating dungeon layouts, large floors, puzzles, and last but not least, hidden areas up the wazoo: LoR offers everything a FPDC aficionado could wish for. Oh, and you can break walls. Break. Walls. I cannot find words to explain how exhilarating it is to carve yourself a shortcut or to uncover brand-new areas by punching your way through walls. — Team building: Say goodbye to the solo run temptation! LoR is one of those games that gives the same amount of XP to all party members regardless of their numbers, which means that I can indulge in team building without a second though. And since there's no equipment galore and all pieces of gear can be equipped by all classes (albeit weapon efficiency varies greatly between classes), I don't have to bother with nightmarish levels of micromanagement. Sure, the game makes things a bit more complicated than necessary by slapping all sorts of fancy concepts on top of its (very traditional) gameplay mechanics, like many recent FPDCs; but it doesn't take long to make sense of LoR's terminology, especially when you have a couple of FPDCs under your belt.— Farming: I just revised my opinion on farming: I don't dislike it overall, I dislike it only when it's poorly handled. Which is so not the case in LoR. Heck, this game elevates farming to an art — and to an ungodly obsession. On top of the obligatory monster drops, you can gather mana, which is used as a currency of sorts and serves various interesting purposes (oh, how I love sucking mana from the dungeon's dirty walls); even better, you can get your greedy hands on all sorts of lovely loot, from neat pieces of gear to rare items. Oh, and the game resets the mana and loot points every time you exit the dungeon and kindly shows you where all those treasures are lying. To say that I could hardly resist the lure of said treasures when I roamed is very much an understatement, and impromtu farming sessions made a good chunk of those six hours I spent playing LoR's demo.— Combat: It's your standard turn-based fare, with a couple of clever twists — the main and best one being that encounters are not random. You can see enemies on the screen, just like FOES in Etrian Odyssey; and if you maneuver well, you can approach them from the back or the side and take them by surprise, which makes fights much faster and smoother. This also means that you're free to make a beeline for foes or to run away from them, depending on your goals of the moment. Another neat twist is that the game kindly lets you know when your attacks and weapons are effective or ineffective against a foe, just like any good old Pokemon game. Also, battles flow fast and are usually over in a couple of turns, which only makes you greedier for the next battle. What else? The soundtrack is lush, the art is gorgeous, the story is deliciously wacky, and main character Dronya is such a complete b*tch that it become hilarious. I need that game in my life, and I need copious amounts of it. Here's my plan laid thereupon for you, dear fellow gamers: first, I'm going to purchase the Vita version of LoR for collecting purposes, before it becomes prohibitely rare and expensive; then, I'll purchase the Switch version, play it to death and sell it once I'm done, after which I'll turn to the Vita version when I want to replay the game. Such a perfectly designed plan, which will allow me to play LoR right now and not struggle with japanese to do so! This post marks the end of my Demo Runs. The whole endeavour was not as fructuous as I had hoped; but one final purchase out of seven demos is better than nothing, I guess. Still, it was entertaining: I could be fully honest with my feelings about those demos and drop them in a flash if they failed to please, knowing that I had gotten them for free. No sunk cost fallacy here, baby! I think I'll try my hands at demos more often from now on, especially given how expensive Switch games are. I hope you enjoyed those Demo Runs as much as me, dear fellow gamers; as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Valkyria Chronicles 4 Demo: I'm confused", "date": "21/11/2018", "text": "Valkyria Chronicles 4 opens with a picture of a tank in a flower field; and that picture pretty much sums up my experience with the demo. This game is such a potpourri of contradictory features and elements that it could totally have been subtitled 'Cognitive Dissonance'.How the heck did you come up here without crushing flowers, buddy?First, you have the fighting system, which I would describe as 'realistic, yet not quite'. VC4 sure looks like a wannabe FPS at first sight, with its various weapon types, its aiming feature and its naturalistic-looking battlefields; yet weirdly enough, units get tired after a mere couple of steps and everybody can eat several bullets before kicking the bucket, pretty much like in any other grid-based SRPG under the sun. This mishmash of FPS and SRPG would be tolerable, if not for the fact that it makes battles painfully drawn-out and tedious. So my units cannot take more than ten bloody steps at a time, yet they have to choose the right weapon for each enemy and aim precisely? Give me a break — and automatic aiming, game. You cannot be realistic just when you fancy it. Cannot walk more than 50 m, but has faux cat ears and camel toe. Nice sense of priority, Sega. Then you have the atmosphere, which is just way too mellow and easygoing for a warzone. It's all lovely villages surrounded with pristine green pastures: is there even a war going on there? Also, the game mixes light-hearted bantering and anime tropes with a supposedly serious story about a bloody war covering a whole continent; maybe that's just me, but I cannot help but think that there's a teeny-weeny tone issue in that picture. I'm also growing too old to swallow the fact that only youths are fighting in that supposedly all-encompassing war. Oh, and the journal gimmick is just ridiculous. Who has the time to keep a neat, tidy little journal when toiling on a warzone? Err... Nevermind. Last but not least, the art is painfully out of touch. For once, VR4 boasts way too many pastel colours and not nearly enough red and browns for a game that's all about war. (I never though I would call for browns in a game ever, but there you have it.) For another, there's a serious issue with character design, and especially with outfits. Are leggings and short skirts really the most practical options for female soldiers, in a game that wants to play it realistic to a certain extent? And what's with all the boob, butt and crotch shots? I really cannot take meetings about the next operation seriously at all when you're zooming on the commanding officer's bosom, game. On the left half: soldiers. On the right half: fan service. In a nutshell, there's one thing I want to say to that game, and by extension to Sega: you cannot have your cake and eat it too, buddy. You need to choose: either you go for a full anime setting, and then you get off my case with annoyances such as manual aiming and messy realistic-looking battlefields; or you go for a gritty, FPS-ish setting with the colours and the seriousness to match — and then I won't touch your game with a ten foot pole, but that's another matter. As it is, I won't come closer to VC4 anyway. I wanted to love that game, I really did; but it's just too confusing and disconcerting for poor little me. And too slow and cutscene-laden too, which certainly doesn't help matters. But now comes my ultimate demo, dear fellow gamers; and as you'll see very soon, I pretty much saved the best for last. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Lost Sphear Demo: Dreadful", "date": "17/11/2018", "text": "I'm not gonna go all dramatic and cry that Square Enix have lost their touch, that their glory days are long gone and that they couldn't produce a good RPG these days even if they had the manual. Instead, I'm simply gonna say this: playing Lost Sphear fills me with a dread that I can hardly put into words. I usually enjoy playing even the most mediocre of RPGs, simply by sheer virtue of them being, well, RPGs; but not so with Lost Sphear. This is simply the dreariest, most depressing and disheartening RPG experience I've had in a long time — maybe ever. Here's a list of the things that made me give up on Lost Spear's demo before it was even over and oust the game from my To-Get-My-Paws-On List for all eternity:— The graphics are disgusting. I'm usually not too finnicky when it comes to that particular aspect of video games; but the combination of Lost Spear's cheap, plasticky phone(y) game art style and pukish, shitty colours really offends my retinas. (Don't trust the pictures here: the game looks much worse when you're actually playing it.) On top of that, the sprites are ridiculously tiny, especially on the word map. I have the sharpest eyesight and never had any problem with sprite size in any game, ever; and yet I have to squint to keep track of Lost Sphear's characters. — The fighting system is horrendous. In a nutshell, it's Hyperdimension Neptunia's fighting system done wrong. HN reaped all the good points of all three main RPG fighting systems while neatly ousting their bad points; Lost Sphear, on the other end, racks up all the bad points of said three fighting systems and lets none of their good points in. Lost Sphear's (sorry excuse for a) battle system has the tension of real-time combat (you lose your turn if you don't spring into action quick enough), the slowness of turn-based combat (you still have to wait for your turn) and the fastidiousness of tactical combat (you have to position your character properly to land an attack). I swear, it's like Squeenix went out of their way to create the most cumbersome and tedious fighting system ever; this is not an homage to retro RPG by any stretch of the imagination, no matter what Lost Sphear's promotional blurb claims. I kid you not: this is the first time ever I found myself actively avoiding battles in an RPG after a mere ten minutes of play.  — The level design is boring. Empty space is strong with this one, ooh yes indeed. Big empty corridors that could accommodate regiments of sprites, vast stretches of (waste)land filled with absolutely nothing: I feel like I'm playing an early 3D Playstation game here, not a retro-heavy JRPG crafted by the two former companies that single-handedly built up the genre. — Last but not least, the pet peeves. The demo starts in medias res, with people throwing orders at me and my whole party lounging around lv.20; this gives me the unpleasant impression that I'm playing someone else's save file — not to mention that this also probably means that you cannot import save data from the demo to the full game. Also, I hate the whole mecha gimmick. And I also hate all those dumb, outdated little hindrances such as the long animation for climbing ladders and the fact that you cannot climb said ladders with the mecha suit. In a nutshell, I'm not buying Lost Sphear in a million years. Playing that demo was a lifeless, tedious and pitiful experience, and I honestly cannot fathom how Square Enix could go from the sheer retro brilliance of Bravely Default to the utter dullness of Lost Sphear. That's two Switch demos down, and I can only hope that the last two will prove better. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "One More Dungeon Demo: No way", "date": "13/11/2018", "text": "That game's name reminds me of my blogging beginnings. Did you know, dear fellow gamers, that I initially wanted to name my little blog 'One More Level'? As in: \"heck, let's just grind a liiiittle more and gain one more level before I turn off the game and go to bed\". Alas, the name was taken; I had to rack my brains to find a name with a similar meaning, and the rest is history.That anecdote will be the meatiest thing in that post, I'm afraid; because the truth is that I have painfully little to say about OMD itself. It's a Doom ripoff with a fantasy setting, and it has the worst control scheme I've seen this side of... Well, nothing, actually. You move with the left analog stick, orient the camera with the right analog stick, and fire your two weapons with... the L and R buttons. Because the A and B buttons are so over, you know. This is the most unintuitive, uncomfortable, cramp-inducing control scheme I've ever had the misfortune of enduring on a handheld, and it's an absolute deal-breaker as far as I'm concerned. Compared to those controls from hell, the fact that the game is ridiculously hard and that hitboxes are as wobbly as jelly pudding is hardly worth mentioning. But I'm doing it anyway, just out of spite.Next please! OMD was my first Switch demo; and needless to say, I hope that my three other Switch demos will raise the bar and be more enjoyable. See you soon for more demo tidings, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Cladun Returns: This is Sengoku! Demo: I'm bored", "date": "09/11/2018", "text": "By all accounts, I should just love that game. I should revel in its simplicity and straightforwardness, I should lap up its retro graphics, and I should have a field day with its hack-and-slashy fighting system. And yet, none of this is happening; instead, I'm bored. Dreadfully, terribly, horribly bored. So bored, in fact, that I cannot even bring myself to play ClaSen for more than a couple of minutes at a time before turning off my Vita with a sigh of relief. I cleared the first chapter with great difficulty; and although the demo is not over yet, I really don't feel like going any further.Needless to say, I tried to figure out why ClaSen so totally failed to enthrall me. Could it be because of its half-baked combat marred with wobbly hitboxes and a general stiffness that doesn't go well with real-time action? Could it be because of its ugly pukish colour palette? Could it be because of its pint-sized dungeons totally devoid of challenge and interest? Could it be because of its party support system, which tries to be sophisticated yet comes across as needlessly complicated and pedantic? Or could it be because of all of that combined? Blimey, of course it's because of all of that combined!Or not really, actually. The aforementioned flaws are certainly irritating, but let's be honest: on their own, they certainly wouldn't be enough to bore me to tears and make me swear off ClaSen. I've played plenty of retro-ish games ripe with similar blemishes, from Astonishia Story to Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure, and totally lapped them up nonetheless; so there had to be something else, something that made me want to forget I ever touched that game. That something can be summed up in one sentence: there is just absolutely no reason for that game to sport retro aesthetics. It's neither a throwback nor an homage to a popular gameplay style from the 8-bit era; quite the contrary, ClaSen is a very modern proposition with its phone game-sized dungeons, its gimmicky mechanics and its inclusive sprites that are similar for male and female characters. It could have sported 3D graphics, and nothing would have been lost in the process. As a genuine retro gamer who was there back in the days, I feel like ClaSen's developers try to pry on my nostalgia and use my soft gamer's heart to make monies; and needless to say, I don't like that much.It goes without saying that I won't purchase the full version of ClaSen. Another one bites the dust! The good thing with demos is that since they're free, I don't feel pressured by the desire to recoup my investment and I can be fully honest about my feelings for the involved game. The bad thing in that particular case is that I own the first two Cladun entries; and if there are as lacklustre as ClaSen, there goes my money down the drain! See you soon for my next demo report, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "London Detective Mysteria Demo: Maybe, maybe not", "date": "05/11/2018", "text": "I was utterly surprised to find a demo for London Detective Mysteria, a VN I had heard about a long time ago yet totally forgotten. How on earth did I miss that demo on the PSN? Is it that old? Or do demos simply not appear in the regular game list? At any rate, I now have my eye on LDM, if only because it was not developed by Otomate; I'm curious to see what other developers can do with the otome genre, and if we can escape good ol' Otomate tropes such as confinement, childhood friends and wolves in sheep's clothing.The demo is painfully short, as expected for a VN; but that short time with LDM was very pleasant nonetheless. Those fifteen-or-so minutes were more than enough to realize that the colour palette is gorgeous, with rich and crystalline hues, and the character design is lovely without being overdone. (I'm especially fond of Watson's faux-bavarian style and MC Emily's cute yet sassy little face.) Characters are well-defined, and their personalities get to shine right from the start. Based on those elements alone, LDM would be a surefire purchase.But then, there's also the story. I have to wonder if that \"detective\" in the title means that I'll get to flex my investigative muscle, or if it's just an excuse to write a big, fat crossover fanfic featuring luminaries from all walks of detective fiction. The demo didn't offer dialogue choices, so I'll be inclined to think that the latter is true; however, this was only the prologue, and things could change later in the game. For now, I'll just assume that LDM won't let me investigate anything myself, just for the sake of avoiding disappointment. That being said, I also have to question the overall quality of the story: because if the 'case' featured in the demo is any indication, then I'm not holding my breath at the thought of the investigations to come. (Spoilers!) Said case involves the crew tracking down a cat whilst babbling nonsense about feline behaviours — such as the notion that cats can willingly backtrack in their own prints to hide their whereabouts, yeah right — after which Emily produces an ad hoc plant that can attract cats when burnt, which allows her to capture the fleeing cat. Am I supposed to take that 'case' seriously, or is this just a silly appetizer before the story starts for good — and starts being good? (End of spoilers)Well, I guess the only way to find out is to purchase the game, isn't it? Alas, XSEED is not exactly forthcoming about release details: apart from a vague \"Fall 2018\" mention on their website, there is no information available regarding the release format or the price tag. Those two elements are probably going to determine whether I purchase the game or not: if LDM is digital-only and comes with a hefty price tag — say 40 euros or more — then I may simply pass on it. Or I may buy it nonetheless, if my gaming instinct really craves it. Or I may wait for a hypothetical discount. Heck, I really don't know yet, to be honest. Let's just wait and see, shall we? Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Shining Resonance Refrain Demo: I'll pass, thanks", "date": "02/11/2018", "text": "Demos are short by nature, and so will be my posts about them. Let's kickstart these Demo Runs with the 30-minute-long Shining Resonance Refrain demo, which I'll sum up as such: that game is just not good enough to be on the Switch, let alone with a 50 bucks price tag.Granted, it may seem a bit unfair to judge a whole game after playing it for a mere 30 minutes. However, those 30 minutes were more than enough to realize that we're dealing with one of those mediocre, cookie-cutter JRPGs that try to lure the player in with a whole posse of scantily clad female characters and a crap ton of flashy, stylish cutscenes. Peel away all that eye-candy, though, and you're left with crappy dungeon design and a mediocre fighting system.I'll pass on the crappy dungeon design, which consists mostly of empty corridors bigger than they should reasonably be, and focus on the mediocre fighting system. I honestly fail to fathom how a 2014 PS3 game could be (dis)graced with such poor, half-baked real-time combat. (Heck, Avalon Code on the DS has better real-time combat than SRR, and it was released six years prior on a much weaker system.) The crux of the problem with SRR's fighting system is how stiff and unintuitive it is. It's supposed to be real-time action; and yet, the game pauses for two seconds every time you engage a foe in order to change the music and create some kind of 'fighting dimension', just like any good old turn-based RPG. Not only is that pause totally useless, but it also completely breaks the flow of combat. Then, there's the issue of combos: like any ARPG worth its salt, SRR lets your character perform a combo after delivering several hits in a row. That would be all nice and fine if the combos weren't so stupidly long, which allows foes to hit your character before the combo animation is over. And don't get me started on the stupid action gauge, which depletes as you hit foes and leaves you unable to strike when empty, forcing you to retreat while it refills. I mean, why? Why won't you let me hack and slash to my heart's content, game? Are you an ARPG or not? Last but certainly not least, long-range weapons are horribly handled: the character that wields them doesn't shoot fast enough and cannot shoot while moving, which means that you have to back down constantly to avoid being hit and have enough room to shoot. Horrible.That being said, I kinda liked SRR's combat nonetheless, and I could probably have gotten used to it under other circumstances. As it is, SRR is too loaded with cutscenes and dialogues for my taste: the demo features roughly ten minutes of fighting for twenty minutes of cutscenes, and that's with me going out of my way to kill all the available enemies. But most importantly, my decision to pass on SRR is mostly a matter of expectations vs. reality. See, Shining Resonance was initially part of that long line of outlandish Shining games with highly recognizable character designs by Tony Naka — Shining Hearts, Shining Ark, Shining Blade and the like. Most of these games were released on the PSP around 2010, and that's how I came to view that particular part of the Shining series: PSP-ish games, with the graphics and gameplay to match. Had I played SRR on the PSP, I would probably have enjoyed it and deemed it perfectly decent; however, it simply doesn't hold up as a 2018 Switch game. Ten years have passed since the PSP's heydays; and things that were totally acceptable on Sony's first handheld, such as a clunky fighting system or bland dungeons, just don't cut it on Nintendo's latest hybrid console.And so I'll pass on SRR. I was actually a hairbreadth away from purchasing it when I played the demo; and needless to say, I'm immensely glad that I gave said demo a try. 50 bucks saved! Geez, all games with price tags above 40 bucks should have demos. With that said, see you soon for my next demo report, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Demo Runs: Foreword", "date": "29/10/2018", "text": "Greetings, dear fellow gamers! I've had a hard time focusing on gaming lately; as a result, the last weeks have been littered with aborted playthroughs and wishful thinking about playing this, that and the other game. I pick up a game I fancy playing, only to give up on it after a mere hour of play because I cannot stand the thought of pouring 30 more hours in it. That's the issue when your game library comprises mostly RPGs, I guess! But deep down, I still want to play games; and that's why I've decided to use that low-energy spell to play a couple of Switch and Vita demos.I have seven demos lined up, two for the Vita and five for the Switch; and for suspense's sake, I'll keep the names of the involved games under wraps until I write about them.

{"title": "Tetris: How I learnt to stop worrying and love the game (somewhat)", "date": "28/10/2018", "text": "Although I firmly consider Super Mario Land to be my first ever Game Boy game, it's actually not the first Game Boy game I played: just like probably 99% of Game Boy owners, I first cut my teeth on packed-in Russian cult classic Tetris. However, this is a fact that I'm usually very prompt to forget, and with good reason: I've always hated that most famous of puzzle games.Okay, maybe \"hated\" is a bit too strong a term. Let's just say that I never saw the appeal of Tetris: whilst my sister and my neighbour could rack up lines for what seemed like hours and got to feast their eyes on the fabled space shuttles on multiple occasions, I was bored stiff after ten minutes of play. That is, when I actually lasted that long: on top of not liking Tetris, I sucked hard at it, and it usually took but a couple of minutes before my screen became cluttered beyond repair. The fact that seemingly everyone but me loved that game and excelled at it only added fuel to the fire of my aggravation: what was I missing there, and why couldn't I enjoy that darn game when it was the only one I owned? To top it all off, the sound effects grated on my nerves — especially that stupid squeaky whimper after clearing the Holy Four Lines, which always made me feel like my Game Boy was in pain. Like, as much in pain as me when playing that game. The only thing I truly liked in Tetris was the B theme; and even that awesome piece of music was not enough to convince me to suffer through the game. As soon as I got my paws on other games, I dropped Tetris and never touched it again. That is, until now.I purchased a Tetris cartridge recently for two reasons: I had one unused cartridge case and wanted a game to fill it up, and I was curious to see if I still hated Tetris after nearly twenty years of not touching it. (Very stupid reasons indeed, which probably wouldn't have cut it hadn't my cartridge been dirt cheap.) The answer to the latter is, surprisingly enough, not quite. I found myself not only playing Tetris with surprising ease, but also enjoying it; and that most unexpected state of affairs is due to the fact that I managed to alleviate most of the things that irritated me as a kid. Namely: — The open-endedness: I never liked games with no definitive goal and no ending, and I don't think I ever will; however, that issue was neatly solved when I discovered the B mode, a gameplay style that I cannot remember playing as a kid. Having to clear a puny 25 lines instead of a potential infinity of them suddenly makes the whole thing seem much more manageable — not to mention that you can ramp up the challenge by cranking up the speed and block height, confident that you'll manage to survive those 25 lines most of the time. — The messiness: Unlike fellow packed-in Game Gear game Columns, which looks crystalline and pristine, Tetris looks rough and messy. The pieces are so weirdly shaped that you always end up with bits sticking out here and there, no matter how hard you try to keep things compact; this is worsened by the fact that after wiping out a line, pieces above said line don't gracefully fall into the holes below, but rather float awkwardly in the air. I'll admit it: I simply couldn't stand this as a kid, and Tetris routinely sent me into the pits of OCD hell. Now, how do I keep all that unruliness at bay as an adult, you may ask? Well, on top of being (fortunately) more desensitized when it comes to OCD triggers, I simply manage to stack up pieces in a more efficient way nowadays, avoiding ugly holes and protuberances. Ah, the joys of getting older and wiser. — The unforgiveness: Tetris is a much more unforgiving brand of puzzle game than, say, Puyo-Puyo or Columns. The latter are colour-based and usually give you a lot of leeway to improvise; Tetris, on the other hand, is exclusively shape-based, with shapes so specific that things can easily go haywire in a matter of seconds if you don't get the right pieces or fail to arrange your pieces properly. Every Tetris player has felt that pang of regret when placing a piece in a certain spot, only to realise one second later that it would have worked better in a different spot and/or that the next piece in line would have fitted even better. Nowadays, my answer to Tetris' stern brand of gameplay is simply to relax and let go of perfectionism. A bit of strategizing goes a long way in Tetris: little tricks I couldn't figure out as a kid, such as pondering your next move while letting the current piece fall after positioning it properly, or stacking long pieces on the sides to free some room in the middle and avoid protrusions, can really work miracles and change one's fortunes. Also, mistakes won't necessarily doom a run: a poorly placed piece can always be recycled and used in a different setup later! And if you lose still, no sweat: you'll just do better in the next run, which is a mere couple of seconds away.  Now, as the title of this post implies, I'm still not that fond of Tetris. Granted, I like it much more than when I was a kid; but there are still plenty of things that annoy me to no end in that game, such as the impossibility of twisting tetraminos when they're in contact with the walls, the overeliance on luck in the harder levels of the B mode, or the unavoidable acceleration that occurs in A mode and prevents the player from simply enjoying the game at their own pace. Last but not least, playing too much Tetris simply irritates me: after a couple of runs, I invariably become tense and angry, and I must fight strong urges to throw my GBA at the nearest wall. That's when I know I've had enough Tetris for the day. Still, the fact that I can now play that game and enjoy it to some extent is nearly a miracle, given how much and how long I've despised it. Oh, and I really, really dig the A Theme now! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon X: The Wigglytuff Solo Run", "date": "24/10/2018", "text": "When it comes to Pokemon solo runs, I love nothing more than to draw inspiration from external sources. This often leads to all sorts of thrilling challenges that I would probably not have thought of, were I left to my own devices. Sources of Pokenspiration range from Youtube videos (cue my Meowstic solo runs, inspired by a video about gender dismorphism in the Pokemon franchise) to comments from you, dear fellow gamers; and let's be honest, the latter is definitely more entertaining, as it means that I'm not the only one invested in the success of the involved run. Sieg and Kumiko have already provided me with many a great solo run candidate; and recently, faithful reader Melanie expressed her dream of cruising Kalos with Jigglypuff. This was wishful thinking, though; because, as she mentioned herself in a comment, Melanie hates the sheer grindiness of the series. What was I to do? Heck, take up the gauntlet and give her the opportunity to tackle a Jigglypuff solo run vicariously, of course! And that's how I found myself roaming Kalos with that cutest, pinkiest and roundest of 'Mons.I might add \"crappiest\" to that list of superlatives; because oh boy, is Jigglypuff very crappy indeed when it comes to stats and general battle prowess. I honestly fail to fathom what that cute creature's niche was supposed to be, or even if it was supposed to have a niche at all beyond looking adorable. With a base Defense of 20 and base Sp.Defense of 25, Jigglypuff is even more fragile than Skitty; and her base 45 Attack and Sp.Attack are nothing to write Professor Oak about. Even worse, Jigglypuff is crippled by the worst base Speed I've seen this side of Roggenrola, i.e. a puny, pathetic 20. Her only redeeming quality are her ample amounts of HP, which still do little more than guarantee that she'll stay alive longer than one turn on the battlefield. In a way, this was maybe my most formidable solo run challenge to date: would I, as a Trainer, be qualified to take such a weak, fragile and slow 'Mon all the way to the Pokemon League?Nope, I didn't do nothing.As it turned out, the answer was yes — although to be fair, I had to cheat a little bit to kickstart the run. The main issue is that Igglybuff, Jigglypuff's pre-evolution, is one of these baby 'Mons that are utterly powerless on the battlefield: the creature learns its first offensive Move at lv.5 and just cannot hit before that. So I had the choice: either switch with my Starter until my Igglybuff reached lv.5 and learnt Pound, or slap an offensive Move on her before the trade. Feeling lazy at the time, I opted for the latter option and let my newly hatched Igglybuff learn Flamethrower before sending him to my copy of X. Because hey, if you're gonna cheat, you might as well go for it full force! And mind you, Igglybuff's stats are so horrid that Flamethrower didn't even do that much damage, let alone one-shot anything.Although the early stages were kinda rocky, my run changed for the better when Igglybuff finally trusted me enough to evolve into an adorable Jigglypuff. My initial plan was to run with that form for as long as I could, maybe even all the way to the Pokemon League; however, an oversight on my part regarding Type weaknesses kinda spoilt that plan. Overcoming the Rock Gym was difficult enough, yet manageable; however, when we reached the third Gym, home to Korrina and her Fighting 'Mons, I reasoned that the time to use the Moon Stone had finally come. My Jigglypuff was reaching the obedience level cap, and I simply needed the extra buff provided by the evolution into Wigglytuff to conquer that Gym — or even survive it, for that matter. Or so I though; because indeed, I hadn't factored in Jigglypuff's double Type, which simply cancelled out her weakness to Fighting. Talk about being a Pokemon noob!Anyway, the evolutionary Rubicon was crossed, and I cruised with Wigglytuff from that point on. And my, did the rabbit-like creature perform honourably on the battlefield despite her lacklustre stats. On top of Flamethrower, which my Wigglytuff wielded until the very end, I taught her Ice Beam, Dazzling Gleam and Return; and armed with that neat Move pool and the occasional Battle Item, we conquered every Kalos Gym and the Pokemon League. And that, dear fellow gamers, pretty much proves that ovelevelling can transform even the wimpiest of wimpy 'Mons into a fighting powerhouse. That run also proved that even traded 'Mons with the fastest levelling-up rate can stay below the obedience level cap all the way through in X&Y, providing that you leave Pokemon Amie untouched and avoid Trainers when your One and Only starts flirting with the current level cap. Being able to run with a 'Mon from the very beginning of the game used to be an experience restricted to the Starters; but thanks to the combination of breeding and trading, I can now get that intense bond with any 'Mon under the sun and take pride in cruising the whole region with them, from my modest hometown to the perilous heights of the Pokemon League! No more making do with a Starter I cannot get attached to until I reach my 'Mon of choice; I can now do genuine 100% solo runs even with the latest of late-gamers, and that's awesome. So here's to you, Melanie: the Jigglypuff Solo Run of your dreams, brought on a silver platter by yours truly! And my, was it fun too. Although if I'm totally honest here, I still feel that I have a bit of unfinished business with the pink round creature. There's the issue of her evolving too early for my taste, obviously; and I also cannot help but wonder how she performed before Gen VI, i.e. as a purely Normal 'Mon. Dare I say that I now want to tackle a Jigglypuff solo run in an older entry? Why yes, I'll totally say it! But in the meantime, I though of a neat little challenge: I want to invite you, dear fellow gamers, to come up with the most unsuitable candidates you can think of for Pokemon solo runs — and then, I'll obviously tackle runs with said most unsuitable candidates and try my hardest to take them all the way to the Pokemon League. Feel free to leave your most outlandish suggestions in the comments; and as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Adventures to go: (Really just) a farming fest", "date": "19/10/2018", "text": "Some say that the PSP is the true king of the RPG hill as far as handhelds go; and as much as I love all my DS and Vita RPGs, I have to admit that there's a kernel of truth in that assertion — a mighty big kernel, mind you. Even the most low-fi and budget PSP RPG has a certain wholesomeness to it, as though RPGs released on that system miraculously managed to capture the very essence of what RPGs are about. PSP RPGs usually strike a perfect balance between fulfilling gameplay mechanics, gorgeous graphics that borrow from both retro and modern gaming and premises that are original yet not too gimmicky or outlandish. They are so utterly excellent that I still have to play a PSP RPG that I don't like and whose evocation don't bring a giddy smile to my face and dreamy memories to my mind.Adventures to Go is no exception to that rule of PSP RPG awesomeness. It's very obviously a budget release; and yet it sports pretty decent graphics, an entertaining cast of characters and a fighting system that's the stuff of dreams, expertly delivering turn-based combat goodness with a whiff of strategy. If you've played Rainbow Moon, you'll feel right at home playing ATG: this is the exact same fighting system, with the added — and wonderful — possibility of ambushing foes in ATG. Last but not least, ATG boasts a simple yet terrifically efficient and addictive premise: to farm items in randomly generated dungeons, over and over.  As you may know already, I dislike farming; and yet, I found myself really digging ATG. There are two reasons for that unexpected love: the first, and most minor one, is the forgiving drop rate that pretty much guarantees that you'll snatch the required item(s) after a mere couple of battles. The second and major reason is the fact that dungeons are designed on demand by none other that you, the player. You can mix and match enemies and landscapes to obtain the dungeon of your dreams — in other words, the dungeon that will grant you the stuff required by your quests du jour. Not only does that feature provide a modicum of control over events and eliminate the frustration that can stem from genuine random dungeon generation, but it also allows for some welcome profitability. If you play your cards well, you can polish off several quests in one fell swoop and a single dungeon visit! In practice though, that dream scenario is not always possible: enemies and landscape options in dungeons cost a hefty sum of money, and ATG's tigh money balance won't always allow you to make the most of your trips. Using cheap or free dungeon visits to farm money is pretty much required, especially if you want to upgrade your party's gear on a regular basis or build up their magical abilities.As much as I love ATG, it's hard to ignore its major flaw: the farming premise, as entertaining as it is, is simply not meaty enough to support a whole game. The thrill of discovering new locations, foes and items quickly wears out, especially when dungeons get longer and foes grow more obnoxious. Either ATG should have been significantly shorter and more fast-paced, or it should have introduced more features as it went on; because as it is, that game is really not much deeper than your average phone game. Sure, one can argue that phone games were not yet a thing back then, and that ATG's premise was thus perfectly acceptable; however, that doesn't make the gameplay any less boring on the long run. I just dropped ATG after a mere 10 hours of play, simply because it was becoming too dull for my taste. That doesn't mean that I swore it off, though; I'll definitely come back to it later, just like I did with Rainbow Moon. Some games are made to be enjoyed in small doses, indeed! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Psychedelica of the Ashen Hawk: How to spoil a good VN", "date": "15/10/2018", "text": "PAH was off to a good start, it really was; but that was before the writers took a couple of unfathomable and painfully uninspired decisions, messily soiling their own work in the process. PAH had the potential to be a true gem, one of the very best VNs out there; instead, it ends up being merely passable, and here's why. (Spoilers!)— The ties with Black Butterfly. This is simply the single worst decision pertaining to PAH's story: not only does the link between the two stories come somewhat out of left field and feel shoehorned into the story, but it creates a milling mass of plotholes that wouldn't have existed otherwise. It's also really just cheap fan-service, when you think of it: so Kagiha, Hikage and Usagi from PBB are now stranded in PAH's world under a slightly different guise because reasons, and I'm supposed to cream my pants at the mere sight of them? Even though making Usagi an actual rabbit is possibly the worst case of dumb literal interpretation I've ever encountered? Am I also supposed to lose it when discovering the cast of PAH in school uniforms in the Girl Ending? To me, this is nothing but lame pandering to the current trend of unifying videogame series under a single narrative flag by forcing together games and stories that were conceived as separate entries. (I'm looking at you, Pokemon and your stupid parallel universes, Zelda and your ridiculous timelines.) Or, in PAH's case, should have been conceived as separate entries: using the Psychedelica concept in different and totally independent settings would have worked beautifully, and even opened the door for sequels and appetizing variations of said concept.  — Hugh. Not only is that guy's design bland and his characterization flat, but he's also the worst case of Deus ex Machina I've seen this side of the Akashic Records in Period Cube. Heck, the writers didn't even try to hide the fact that he's a narrative device on legs: he can teleport, talk to people in their dreams, modify his appearance at will, and generally do anything that's required to get the characters and the story out of a bind. Oh, and he pops up out of thin air to deliver the story's MacGuffin to Jed — because hey, why not? To add insult to injury, we're not even treated to a juicy and meaty explanation regarding his identity and the reason behind his amazing powers. It's been speculated that a third Psychedelica game was in the making and would provide answers regarding those matters; however, two years have passed since PAH's release, and it's becoming less and less likely that this fabled sequel will ever see the light of day.— Confusing is thy name: Unlike Black Butterfly, Ashen Hawk does a really poor job at explaining the ins and outs of its story — when it actually tries to explain them. I have to admit that some plot points remain a mystery to me, and I'm not too sure that I would be able to recap the whole thing if I had to. Were the jewels removed from the Kaleido-Via in the 'real' world or in the Psychedelica? Is Jed's red eye ultimately to blame on the jewel stuck in it, or is it a trait inherited from her mother? If everybody remain stuck in the Psychedelica in all endings but the Girl Ending, as the game seems to imply, why does the Psychedelica remain unchanged in some endings yet deteriorates in others? How can there be so-called ghosts in the Psychedelica, when all its inhabitants are already disembodied spirits? Clearing a second run might shed light on those murky matters, granted; but I really shouldn't have to do that in the first place. A story that doesn't leave the reader with a clear view of what happened is just a case of bad storytelling, period.— In for the (cheap) thrill: Some of the story's twists and turns come seriously out of left field, and undermine other genuinely good plot twists in the process. For instance, the reveal of Francesca's scheming nature was a excellent development: as the head of one of the towns' leading factions, it made perfect sense for her to be involved in some dirty machinations and to be a shrewd operator behind her kind facade. On the other hand, making her kill Aria out of sheer jealousy is a step too far and doesn't square with the calmness and sangfroid she displays throughout the story — not to mention her affection towards Jed, the very daughter of the woman she hated. Likewise, discovering that kind, responsible and collected Lavan harbours a burning hate for his father and a desperate drive to avoid becoming like him adds some welcome depth to his character; on the other hand, learning that jolly, happy-go-lucky Levi is a serial killer with an unquenchable lust for blood feels far-fetched and solely designed to upset the reader. And then we have all sorts of incoherencies and out of character behaviours, such as Olgar remaining cold to Jed after learning that she is his daughter, Jed ruthlessly manipulating Tee or Lavan behaving like a brooding, sullen douche in his dedicated ending. — Too little, too fast: All the endings, without exception, are rushed and unfulfilling. It's really a pity and a shame to see all the game's patient exposition squandered and spoiled in unsatisfying endings that don't do justice to the characters. The 'romantic' endings are particularly nasty in that regard: after all the expertly handled steamy moments between Jed and the beaus over the course of the story, it stings to be slapped in the face with those depressing outcomes that hardly show a shred of affection between Jed and her beau du jour.  At the end of the day, PAH is a VN that started well yet ran out of steam at the worst possible moment. I was thoroughly disappointed by the endings and the big reveals that came along with them; and yet, somehow, I still love that game. The characters, the art and the whole atmophere left a huge mark on my heart; and although I would have wanted a different outcome for the whole story, I don't regret my purchase one bit and I'll certainly replay PAH someday. And this, dear fellow gamers, is the end of my 'Summer of Mystery' adventures. Will I ever get to play another localized otome game? Only time will tell! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Psychedelica of the Ashen Hawk: How to build a good VN", "date": "11/10/2018", "text": "Here it is, dear fellow gamers: the last 'Summer of Mystery' instalment, and probably the meatiest as well. Ashen Hawk is similar to Black Butterfly: a Choose Your Own Adventure type of VN, with plenty of branching paths and no active romancing. And as the title implies, it's really good. In fact, it's one of the best VNs I've read, with a stellar build-up and sky-high production values. Here's how PAH manages to be the cream of the crop of otome VNs:— The leading lady is a genuinely deep character and not a mere placeholder for the player. Forget about your usual mute, nondescript otome heroine: Jed is the story's main focus through and through, and her personality and interactions with the rest of the cast are lovingly detailed and get tons of screen time. She's also fully voiced, and we get to see her 'act' on the screen instead of merely seing her portrait in a corner of the dialogue box. — NOT every single male in sight is a love interest, and the leading lady has interactions with other people beyond her potential lovers. All too often, otome VNs create some sort of love bubble that solely contains the heroine and her beaus, as though the rest of the world had simply evaporated. If you're lucky, you get one or two female friends, a baby brother or a bunch of comic relief sidekicks; but there's never any doubt about the fact that those extra characters are mere side dishes. Not so in PAH: not only is a good half of the male cast out of Jed's romantic reach, but she also entertains all sorts of relationships with all sorts of characters, from superficial friendliness to deep filial love.  — PAH is a gorgeous case of 'Show, don't tell'. The game sports plenty of character interactions that give us a good feel of the cast' personalities and relationships, but also allow us to discover the game world and its stakes. PAH really takes the time to establish its lore and atmosphere — which, incidentally, led a number of reviewers to deem the story too lengthy and drawn-out. It's a matter of taste, I guess: as far as I'm concerned, I totally lapped up PAH's long exposition and patient world-building. — PAH is blessed with the Greatest Art of Them All, a splendid display of drawing mastery that enhances the atmosphere and makes us love the cast even more. I honestly don't think I've ever taken that many screenshots in a VN — heck, every single cutscene called for a screen capture! Not only that, but the chara design is also stupendously gorgeous, with lovely outfits, stylish aircuts and lovingly detailed facial expressions. I deem Lavan the Best Otome Beau Ever as far as looks are concerned: not only does he genuinely look like the young adult he's supposed to be, but he's so ridiculously hunky that he manages to pull off a mullet and make it look darn sexy.   — PAH is rife with erotic and romantic tension despite its tricky cross-dressing setting. Mind you, this was quite the tall order: having an heroine pose as a male was not exactly the ideal setting to create a sultry atmosphere, and I wondered how the game was going to pull the whole thing off. The answer is: darn well. I won't tread too much on spoiler territory, but suffice to say that the writers found plenty of clever little ways to sneak in steamy moments without requiring any major suspension of disbelief from the player. Cherry on the cake, eroticism stems from different settings depending on the involved beau (spoilers!): Lavan knows that Jed is a woman yet uses Jed's male act to get physically close to her without looking like a pervert, while Lugus falls in love with the double cross-dressing female version of Jed upon a misunderstanding; as for Levi, he loves Jed regardless of her sex and is thus deeply troubled by any physical closeness or mark of affection from her. (End of spoilers)As dazzling a VN as PAH is, it unfortunately doesn't manage to be dazzling all the way through. Somewhere around the two-third mark, things subtly start going astray; and in a matter of chapters, PAH squanders its amazing potential and fizzles out, going from a brilliant VN to a merely decent one. Let's meet again soon for the story of that demise, dear fellow gamers; until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "7'scarlet: Better by the route", "date": "07/10/2018", "text": "Of the three 'Summer of Mystery' VNs, 7'scarlet is the one that lives up the most to the name: not only does it take place during the summer, with natsu matsuri, warm starry nights and other summery staples, but it also oozes mystery and suspense through every still. 7'S is very much a slow burner of a VN. It doesn't seem to hold much promise at first: the country town setting feels tame and prosaic, the revenant premise sounds overused and cliché, and the art is really not that stellar. And yet, as time and routes fly by, 7'S slowly but surely grows into a fantastic gem of a story. Not only does it manages to craft an enrapturing atmosphere out of its pedestrian settings, but it also spins its mundane story into fascinating and unexpected directions. Storytelling is definitely the game's strongest suit. This is the first time I play a VN that not only holds my interest all the way through, but also makes me more enthralled by the route. All too often, VNs don't live up to expectations and squander their potential, leaving the reader with a serious case of route fatigue; 7'S, on the other hand, only cranks up the suspense and becomes more riveting as routes go on. It distills its lore and explanations in a seamless and organic fashion, leaving you craving for more until the ultimate route that wraps up the whole mystery. 7'S offers a deeply fulfilling resolution that ties up all loose ends while still leaving some of the story's mysteries intact. (Spoilers!) Not providing a definitive explanation for the existence of revenants and their ties to the Violacea was a risky bet that could have left the reader insanely frustrated; yet the game manages to pull it off by injecting a modicum of metaphysics into the narrative. Guided by the characters' musings about all things unexplained and unexplainable and the tiny scope of human knowledge, we warm up to the idea that some events are beyond our understanding and must simply be accepted as they are; and as the story comes to an end, we take in the whole revenant lore gladly and make peace with the story's uncanny events. I love the bittersweet yet open nature of the ending: Ichiko loses her beloved 'brother' for good, yet the remaining Violacea in her garden leaves us with a glimmer of hope: maybe, just maybe, he could eventually come back to her. (End of spoilers.)One thing I really like about 7'S is the way our experience as readers completly mirrors Ichiko's experience: we discover things as she does, and we naturally come to the exact same conclusions. Or at least, we do as far as all things thriller and mystery are concerned; because indeed, when it comes to l'amour, 7'S fails to deliver. There is some active romancing this time around, with romantic routes, affection markers and character endings; but alas, that romance lacks a bit. Not only does it feel a tad rushed, but we also don't get to know the beaus all that much, neither before nor after wooing them. As a result, the love stories feel wooden and forced, and pale when compared to the rest of the story: ending up with any given bachelor feels like a mere side dish, while the overarching story remains the juicy main course that keeps us salivating. It becomes then all the more unbelievable and frustrating to see Ichiko put her search for her brother on the back burner to focus on her beau du jour. It's a pity, really: with better love stories, 7'S could have become a true otome gem, instead of being merely a excellent VN with lacklustre romancing. Since the romance is so underwhelming and the beaus so underdeveloped, I'll skip the route report this time as well. I'll thus see you soon with my thoughts about the ultimate 'Summer of Mystery' offering, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Psychedelica of the Black Butterfly: The romance that never was", "date": "02/10/2018", "text": "Psychedelica of the Black Butterfly is a fantastic visual novel. It oozes style and beauty, boasts a mesmerizing atmosphere, stars a cast that has charisma in spades and is dressed to kill, and sports a life-saving flowchart system that guarantees that you won't ever miss an ending. Cherry on the cake, it also has a lush soundtrack and an unexpected yet delightful shooting mini-game. It's an awesome game that I just loved playing; and yet, it's also a bit of a rip-off.Despite being part of Aksys' 'Summer of Mystery' campaign and being branded as an otome game, PBB is actually a regular visual novel masquerading as an otome game. Sure, a couple of its endings have romantic overtones; however, there is no actual romancing in that game. All the staples of otome games, from romantic routes to affection-raising dialogue choices to good&bad character endings, are nowhere to be found in PBB. Instead, the game boasts branching paths by the truckload, making it more akin to a gamebook than to a true-blue otome. All in all, playing PBB is not about romancing handsome beaus while distractedly following a story that is more often than not a vehicle for l'amour; it is about unraveling a mystery and uncovering all the narrative strings that, put together, create a gorgeous tapestry of a story.Since I'm mentioning the story, here's my two cents' worth: it was well built and well told, with nary a plothole and many a plot twist, and I really loved it overall. However, I would have adored it, had the writers implemented the following suggestions (spoilers ahead!):— Make Monshiro less of a vegetable and more of an actual teenage boy, with testosterone and the like. I know Monshiro is supposed to be the calm type; but there's a not-so-subtle difference between a quiet and shy character and a character who's completely lifeless and apathetic. Not to mention that after ten years spent in a monster-infested psychedelica, Monshiro should have grown into a grizzled, rugged lone ranger à la Aragorn rather than into the wimp he is. — Don't make every single beau secretly in love with Ai since, forever. This is trite and lazy, and there's only so much suspension of disbelief a player can apply before discarding the story as maudlin crap. The 'childhood friend who's been secretly in love with the heroine for years' trope works better when it's scarcely used. — Concurrently, make the cast mixed. Since there is no romancing to speak of, it's perfectly possible to introduce more female characters and thus more interesting situations. How about a rivalry between Ai and a female childhood friend, which ultimately gets resolved in the manor? How about unrequited love, or even a whiff of love triangle? All this would be more thrilling than a bunch of boys enamoured with little Ai for seemingly no other reason than her being the only girl in the group.— A bit more narrative gusto, please. I know that VNs are developed on a budget as a rule; but surely it should be possible to give the beaus a modicum of depth and subtlety and make them more than walking otome clichés — all the more so as PBB is not an actual otome game. Apart from Hikage, who is by far the most complex and well-developed character, every single member of the cast is just a lose asemblage of speaking patterns, stylish poses and gimmicky behaviours — including Ai/Beniyuri, who's little more than a placeholder for the player despite playing a central role in the story. PBB's premise is quite excellent, and it deserves solid characters that make it shine rather than dull it.Since there are no character routes in PBB, there's no route report ahead, and thus come my final words about the game. If you want mystery in a stylish packaging, with little to no ending hassle, then give PBB a try; on the other hand, if you want to woo anime beaus until you swoon, you're definitely better off giving PBB a miss. I'll see you soon with the next 'Summer of Mystery' instalment, dear fellow gamers; until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Dragon Quest V: Happy ending", "date": "28/09/2018", "text": "After 35 fulfilling hours, my DQV playthrough comes to an end. That's not to say that I defeated the last boss and saw the credits roll, though; because the truth is that I didn't. I found said last boss at the bottom of his lair, and engaged him unprepared to test the waters; and while vanquishing his first form was easy enough, his second form wiped out my whole party in a matter of turns. The right course of action would be to go back at him with an vengeance and a solid strategy; however, I just cannot bring myself to do that. To be honest, I don't really care that much about beating Grandmaster Nimzo to a pulp. For once, he's not exactly my sworn enemy: the first time I met him was precisely during the final showdown, and it feels weird to kill a big baddie I just met. Sure, he more or less destroyed my MC's whole life through his minions' actions; but he remained such an elusive presence throughout the whole game that it's hard to resent him genuinely. Slaughtering Ladja was a thrill because of all the bad blood between us; but slaughtering Nimzo feels more like your obligatory Final Boss Fight. And then, there's the issue of me being lazy: there were so few boss fights during the game that I basically grew complacent, and I just cannot be arsed to rack my brain for strategies and try again.And so will DQV remain unfinished business for now. I had a most lovely time with that game, and I'll definitely miss my awesome party — especially my little jailcat Jayla, i.e. the best party member an RPG player could wish for. (She was fast, strong, versatile, and totally adorable to boot; what's not to love?) I won't lie and claim that I loved DQV more than DQIX, though. My DQIX run was one of my most epic RPG playthroughs ever, and DQV simply cannot emulate the sheer scale of DQIX. DQV is more of a domestic RPG, with basic mechanics, a small game world and a mundane yet endearing story. The overall simplicity of the game bordered on shallowness at times, and there was a bit too much flirting with fake longevity; but playing DQV made me happy all the way through, and that's all that matters.So what's next, you may ask? Well, I just secured physical copies of the 'Summer of Mystery' otome games from Aksys; and since I've had my fill of grinding for the time being, I'm gonna unwind by playing those ultimate Aksys offerings. (I cannot imagine any physical Vita game coming out in the West in the months to come, let alone an otome game.) I'll see you soon with tidings of romance and mystery, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Dragon Quest V: Soothing late stages", "date": "24/09/2018", "text": "30 hours, getting close to the final boss. After the slightly tumultuous middle stages of my run, I finally made peace with the game. No longer do I even try to figure out where to go or what to do next if the story doesn't kindly direct me; instead, I run straight to an FAQ and move on. That shameless display of laziness oh-so-wise decision allowed me to focus fully on what I love the most in traditional RPGs, i.e. the holy Grinding. And oh boy, did I grind indeed. My hero and his two feline foils now boast a hefty Lv.45; and although that might be enough to slaughter the final boss, I'm still gonna keep grinding until they all reach the big 50. Just to be sure, and because I love grinding oh so much.The last ten hours have been smooth sailing, a soothing blend of grinding and dungeon exploration. I would have loved to tackle a couple of sidequests as a diversion and grind along the way; but weirdly enough, there are just no sidequests to be found in DQV. (Or, if there are any, they are incredibly well hidden.) I'm quite puzzled by that absence, all the more so as DQIX was a giant sidequest fest. This makes the proliferation of 'Where do I go next' instances in DQV look suspiciously like an attempt at fake longevity, methinks. But I digress; I was actually praising the game and the lovely, grindy ten hours I just spent with it. I recruited a Moosifer around the 25-hour mark, and I don't regret it one bit: that new ally is incredibly strong and sturdy, and he can hold his own on the battlefield just as masterfully as the rest of the crew despite boasting only a paltry Lv.16.I've grinded so much that I unfortunately feel a bit disconnected from the story now; on top of that, the events of the last ten hours somewhat failed to captivate me. (Spoilers!) It was nice to see my expectations as a seasoned RPG player neatly subverted, as the so-called 'Legendary Hero' turned out to be my MC's son instead of said MC himself; however, since I hardly ever interacted with the twins since their introduction, I couldn't care less about my son being the resident Chosen One. That sure won't give him extra levels, and I'm not sure equipping the Zenithian gear can compensate for the 10-level gap between him and his father; but since he's a good healer, maybe he'll be allowed to partake in the final fight if the going gets rough. As for being reunited with Bianca, it was pretty much a case of 'Too little, too late'. I honestly didn't care anymore at that point, and I wouldn't have minded a post-final boss reunion at all. It goes without saying that leveling her up is unthinkable; I would have liked to fight with her more, but she's just too far behind the rest of my crew. Now if you ask me, dropping undelevelled party members on the player so that they'll be forced to grind looks awfully like a display of fake longevity. Especially when it's done multiple times over the course of a single game. (End of spoilers.)So here I am, in the final dungeon and nearly at the last boss' door. I'll grind just a bit more, as promised; and then, it will be time for the final showdown. See you soon for my ultimate DQV tidings, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Dragon Quest V: Mixed middle stages", "date": "20/09/2018", "text": "20 hours of play under my belt, and things are getting a bit sour between me and DQV. The honeymoon period is over, and the game's flaws are starting to rear their ugly heads and to ever-so-slightly spoil my run. Mind you, the grinding is still soothing, the exploration is still thrilling, and the atmosphere is still enthralling; and then you have all those magical little moments that only DQ can provide, such as that glorious fight in which I vanquished two metal slimes with two critical hits. Glorious, indeed. I still love the game very much, really; but I undeniably love it a little less than when I started it, and here's why. No boss fight for hours on end: I honestly cannot remember the last time I faced a boss. Grinding is all well and nice, but it somewhat loses its edge when the game doesn't offer you mighty bosses to use as touchstones. I know bosses are bound to come back before the end of the game (like, literally), but that long boss-less stretch is a bit disturbing nonetheless. The choice that never was: The only thing I knew about DQV before playing it was that you could choose your wife; and while I certainly didn't expect any kind of active romancing from a DQ game, I at least expected to be given a real choice. However, the game frames that 'choice' in a mighty biased way that totally defeats the purpose of letting the player choose. Let's first discard Debora as the obvious added-in-remake troll she is, and let's focus on the two original girls (minor spoilers!). So we have Bianca, our childhood friend we just reunited with; not only is she blatantly is love with us, but her ailing father begs us to take care of her. And then we have Nera, a complete stranger who shows nothing but polite disinterest towards us; not only is she clearly in love with a local knight who loves her back, but she tries to get rid of us by hooking us up with Bianca. If this is not the game actively trying to shove us into Bianca's arms, I don't know what is. There's just no fairness here: one choice feels like Destiny, the other feels like forced mariage. One choice makes you feel like a gentleman, the other makes you feel like a heartbreaker. If the writers wanted the hero to marry Bianca that badly, they should have made that mariage a scripted event. Mind you, I had decided to tie the knot with Bianca from the get-go; but I would have loved a more balanced choice that didn't make me feel like a saint or a scumbag. (End of spoilers)The kids aren't alright: So, the game ultimately dumped my kids on me so that we could all roam&grind together. That certainly fits my hero's role as a father; but pray tell, what am I supposed to do with those wimps as a player? They are painfully underlevelled, which means that I have to waste tons of time grinding if I want to use them in battle. Why would I do that, when I have my already levelled-up feline team at hand? For now, the kiddies stay in the wagon and reap XP from battles; we'll see if they join the party once they reach decent levels. Where do I go next?: Yup, that dreaded old-school RPG trope is alive and well in DQV. While early quests always explicitely told me where to go, current quests are much more elusive, giving me only the faintest of clues and letting me figure out by myself where I'm supposed to be headed. Mind you, this wouldn't be so bad if the world map hadn't fully opened at the same time, giving me countless opportunities to get desperately lost. And yes, I did check walkthroughs once or twice — because hey, I have metric tons of other games waiting to be played and I cannot decently waste precious hours scouring every pixel of a game world.In a nutshell, I mourn the loss of the game's initial simplicity. DQV feels a bit less magical since its map opened up, and the concurrent ramp-up of the narrative stakes doesn't help its case. I loved being a kid busy with discovering the world and saving his own hide; but now, it seems that we're headed towards yet another case of Saving the Bloody World. Mind you, I like DQV's story, and I really enjoy the way it's told — special mention to the stone statue episode, which made me feel genuinely desperate as a spectator and as a player worried for the future of their party. It's just that I had this crazy hope that maybe, just maybe, the game was going to keep things domestic and treat me to a family epopee while giving the world a break. Oh, well. We'll see how the whole thing plays out, I guess. I'll see you soon for more DQV tidings, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Dragon Quest V: Dreamy early stages", "date": "16/09/2018", "text": "The mention of the Dragon Quest series makes me feel all mushy and nostalgic, despite the fact that I became acquainted with it as late as 2012 when I played DQIX. That legendary playthrough means a lot to me: not only was DQIX my first DQ game, but it was also my first turn-based RPG ever, the first of many solo runs and, last but not least, my longest run of any game, clocking at a good 212 hours. I loved DQIX to pieces, and subsequently bought every single DQ entry released on the DS and 3DS, as well as the Gameboy Colour remakes; and yet, weirdly enough, my gaming instinct didn't feel like touching any of these games for the last six years. I guess the memory of that formidable DQIX run was still too fresh in my mind, and it needed to fade away a bit before my gaming instinct craved the series again. It seems that I have indeed forgotten my happy times with DQIX enough, for my gaming instinct suddenly urged me to play DQV. And so I (happily) complied.I fully expected to be reunited with all the beloved staples of the series in DQV, and I was not disappointed. My breath caught in my throat when meeting my first Metal Slime, and finally killing one after many a try made me feel ridiculously happy — happier than vanquishing a bunch of pixels should ever make me feel. I could feast my eyes again on the gorgeous fighting screen backgrounds that had enchanted me so much in DQIX; this seems to be something that the series masters perfectly, and it makes me feel like a lone wanderer more than any open world ever could. I quickly got reacquainted with those oh-so-DQ-esque habits of rummaging through peoples' drawers and warbrobes and checking for fresher and better gear in every new town. Last but not least, I grinded, grinded and grinded — in fact, I'm still grinding.One feature that failed to pop up was the class system of DQIX: and, well, I must confess that I was relieved by that absence. Although I can work my way around class systems in turn-based RPGs, the truth is that I don't like them much: I prefer my chosen one's progression to be simple and straighforward and to rely solely on the power of levels and brute force. Having to choose between classes generates ponderings and hesitations that I simply don't need in my RPG, and I'd rather make do with what I'm given. That being said, DQV offers a replacement for classes in the form of monster recruitment. I was initially planning to give that feature a pass and to focus solely on my given party; but then, I crossed the path of a lovely jailcat that was willing to join my crew, and there was no turning back. Although that new feline recrue could do little more than scratch foes at first, a couple of playing hours molded her into a formidable fighting powerhouse. There's no way I'm letting go of her now, and she'll definitely be part of my team till the final boss. Talking about my party, DQV offers the most perfect mix of solo run and party run I've seen this side of Trails in the Sky. My titular hero has been the only fixture in my party so far, aided by a number of extra party members that come, fight by my side and go as the story unfolds. I really love that setting that allows me to enjoy the best of two worlds: I get that extra oomph in battle thanks to those guests, yet I can still lavish stat-raising items on my MC without a second thought. This also gives me the opportunity to try different fighting strategies, which is something lazy me probably wouldn't have bothered to do otherwise. I just love how straightforward and heartwarming DQV is. The game world is charming and welcoming, just like DQIX's world was; it has an quintessential and intemporal quality that can probably appeal to any RPG fan — or at least not ruffle anyone's feathers, unlike very distinctive RPG settings such as FFVII's steampunk world — and it somehow manages to capture the very essence of fantasy RPG. You know what to expect right from the start: set foot in a town, talk to the locals, agree to solve their big problem (there's always a big problem going on), go to the nearby dungeon, solve the big problem, collect your reward — rinse and repeat until the end of the game. And then you have the mandatory grinding, which may be stifling to some but is also quite soothing and reassuring: no matter how strong the foe, it can always be ultimately defeated with a healthy amount of grinding. No complicated strategies to master, no luck involved: just grind enough and you're set. In an RPG landscape full of increasingly outlandish fighting systems, such simplicity and predictability are a breath of fresh air.I have 10 hours under my belt already; and while I'm pretty sure that my DQV run won't ever be as long as my DQIX one, I still think I have a good number of hours of enjoyable play ahead, if only because I'm grinding so, so much. But hey, I can't help it: battles flow so swiftly with the maximum text speed that I find myself stuck in an transe and unable to stop; and the battle backgrounds are so gorgeous, I just want to gaze at them over and over again. In a nutshell, I'm hooked, and I love being hooked. See you soon for more DQV tidings, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Nurse Love Addiction: The route report", "date": "12/09/2018", "text": "Nurse Love Addiction offers four love interests and nine endings. I have no qualms about admitting that I resorted to an FAQ to land all the endings, and for good reasons: unlike its fellows romantic VNs Norn9 and Amnesia:Memories, NLA doesn't provide any clue to help the player figure out if they're on the right track. On top of that, the relevant dialogue choices are often quite random, and you cannot really figure out the 'right' answer by yourself despite all the patient character development present in the game. Last but not least, most of the bad endings (and some of the good ones as well, for that matter) come completely out of left field and clash vigorously with the story's overall sweet and heartwarming tone, leaving you gaping at the screen in sheer incredulity. Having said that, on with the show! (Giant SPOILERS included!)Itsuki: My least favourite route by a very long shot. On top of disliking Itsuki's design, I was left totally cold by her character (non)development and relationship with Asuka. We're basically dealing with two people that are initially in love with someone else rather than with each other, and it takes an awful lot of crafty storytelling to make such a setting work — storytelling that NLA sadly doesn't display. Itsuki and Asuka find themselves in love with each other out of the blue, and they don't even seem to enjoy it that much — in fact, they seem rather reluctant to be with each other, which certainly doesn't encourage the player to root for them. The big reveal about Itsuki posing as a bold and brash girl when she's actually a shy introvert was interesting; however, the writers made a serious disservice to her and to her story by not letting her switch back to her initial personality when alone with Asuka, which would have made her character much more nuanced and touching. Instead, she keeps her bratty facade on at all times, and comes across as utterly unconvincing in the process: as a reader, I simply cannot believe for a second that she managed to overhaul her own personality so thoroughly and maintain that change for ten-or-so years. And if she does switch back at times, well, she's just insincere for not doing it in front of Asuka. At the end of the day, Itsuki is a painfully one-dimensional and superficial character, and her talking mannerisms (i.e. \"uso da yo\" repeated ad nauseam) and clichéd otaku-ish hobbies really don't help her case. Another thing that doesn't help her route at all is her bad ending, which is so ridiculously improbable that you might miss what's actually happening here at first (I sure as heck did). Prior to this event, there is absolutely nothing in the story that hints at the fact that Asuka could become a cannibal-meets-necrophile upon losing her lover, and the tone shift is so brutal that it kinda fails to register and leaves the player more incredulous than shocked.Sakuya: As the game's resident 'hime', Sakuya gets a route that fits her personality to a T: mysterious, dramatic and romantic, with a super-duper plot twist to crown things. This could have been one of the best routes, if not for the story's excessive reliance on the whole 'destiny' theme. The premise goes as such: Sakuya and Asuka were in love with each other as kids; and that love, far from being your usual puppy love, was a fated romance bound to transcend time and space. We're dealing with the most overused romantic cliché of them all here; and unfortunately, NLA doesn't manage to make the most of it. The main issue is that interactions between Sakuya and Asuka at the nursing school are few and far between; and when said interactions occur, they are usually cold and superficial. Because of that, the game relies overly on Sakuya and Asuka's shared past to craft a romantic vibe between them; but since we, the player, never get to see that shared past with our own eyes, we just cannot get involved and feel the love. This is a classic case of telling instead of showing, and it makes the route quite flat and unbelievable. To make matters worse, the writers pushed the 'fate' thing as far as they could — up until the point where it becomes utterly grotesque. Sakuya's route is the only one in which the bad ending is actually better than the good ending: having Asuka hold a mariage ceremony on the hospital roof with a dying (or freshly dead) Sakuya is just a thousand times more romantic and touching than seeing Sakuya reincarnate as Kyoko's and Asuka's daughter and state in no uncertain terms that she's gonna make a pass at Asuka as soon as she's sexually mature, which makes Asuka giggle in delight. Seriously, game? You wanted to shove in your fated love story so much that you had to dabble in incest? And sure, maybe that new Sakuya is genetically related to Kyoko rather than to Asuka; but the whole thing is vomit-inducing nonetheless.Kaede: This is by far the most grounded route of the bunch, a perfectly normal love story involving normal people doing normal things; and it's also the only romantic route that doesn't mention Asuka's past at the Center at all. Since there is no pre-existing relationship between Kaede and Asuka, the game has to focus on the stakes of their current interactions; the result is an engrossing and subtle piece of story that deals with the perils of romances involving an age gap. As a young and inexperienced girl, Asuka dates Kaede out of admiration and lust, and focuses solely on the entertaining aspects of their relationship rather than on Kaede as a person; Kaede, on the other hand, is a full-grown woman with romantic experience that longs for a deeper and more serious relationship and is not quite sure that Asuka can provide it. From that situation emerges the only remotely predictable crossroad in the entire game: it either leads to the good ending, where Kaede and Asuka end up together, or to the bad ending, where Kaede goes back to her lover yet keeps bonking Asuka on the side. Not giving the letter back to Kaede confirms that Asuka is indeed just an immature brat with no morals who only cares about her own happiness, and leads Kaede straight back into the arms of her former lover — and the player straight into the arms of the bad ending. On the other hand, giving the letter back to Kaede shows that Asuka cares about Kaede's happiness first and foremost and is mature enough to renounce her if need be; such a display of selflessness melts Kaede's heart and secures the good ending. If I had to point a flaw in that route, it would be its overall mundanity and occasional corniness: this is a route that's more likely to induce yawns and embarrassed giggles than to keep you on the edge of your seat. Nao: Lovely Nao-chan was my favourite character by far, both in terms of looks and personality. I had thus a mighty big bias towards her route; and well, I was not disappointed. Nao's and Asuka's love story is by far the deepest and most fleshed-out of the bunch: not only do Nao and Asuka have the greatest amount of interactions, but their romance starts in a really subtle way — little touches that feel more erotic than they should, double entendres that sound a tad too serious, declarations of love that are a little too intense for sisterly love, and so on. You can really feel the love between those two, and this is the only route that actually made my heart flutter and made me root for the pair in earnest. It's also nice to get a plausible explanation for Asuka's weird personality change over the years: although it's never fully confirmed, we can infer that Nao's repeated tampering with Asuka's memories also messed up Asuka's personality, transforming her into the scatterbrained girl she is nowadays. Nao's constant dotting on Asuka is motivated by a mix of intense love for her sister and gnawing guilt over what she did to her; and those conflicting emotional forces get to shine in the good and bad ending respectively. Not getting Asuka's forgiveness and redonning the role of the younger sister who takes guidance from the older one allows Nao to atone for her sins and let go of her guilt, ultimately leading to a fulfilling relationship with Asuka. On the other hand, being forgiven by Asuka increases her guilt so much that she starts somatising and cannot physically stand to be near Asuka; this leads to the most twisted outcome of them all, in which Asuka has to beat Nao repeatedly in order to quell Nao's extreme guilt and self-hatred. The only flaw I could find in Nao's route was the spoilery quality of the whole romance: since it's obvious that the game is not going to show genuine incest on screen, we can guess pretty much right from the start that Nao and Asuka are not biological sisters. Of course, this also generates a modicum of suspense, so maybe it's not that much of a flaw after all.Asuka: Miss Jellyfish has her own dedicated 'owner of a lonely heart' route, which happens if you fail to romance anyone. It shows Asuka dutifully pursuing her daily life and her studies; upon graduating, she reflects on the past three years and gets a bittersweet feeling, commenting on the fact that she didn't \"find her star\". As uneventful as it is, this route is actually one of my favourites: it maintains the sweet, heartwarming and comforting vibe of the story all the way through and spares us all the gruesome stuff present in the other routes. It's kinda refreshing to experience Asuka as a perfectly normal girl, with no traumatizing past or twisted relationships to worry about; in a way, that somewhat dull ending is a perfectly happy one.NLA apparently has no true route; however, I fancy thinking that Nao's route is the true route in disguise, if only because of the intensity of their love for each other. Nao's relationship with Asuka is ten times the 'fated love' Asuka's relationship with Sakuya ever could be, with them meeting as children and ending up in the same family without ever being separated since. Also, look at the picture above: Nao and Asuka are the same size and basically glued to each other, while the other girls' heads are bigger and kinda float in the background, like larger-than-life fantasies that have no real chance of ever becoming true. If we want to go really wild, we can postulate that Nao only manages to rescue Asuka from Kyoko's stabbing in her own route thanks to the strengthening of their love bond, and fails to do so in other routes because of the converse weakening of said bond; consequently, all routes bar Nao's are just the twisted dreams of an Asuka stuck in a coma. Of course, it's probably just my own fondness for Nao speaking; but in the absence of any officially anointed true route, I can let my imagination run the show. And these, dear fellow gamers, are my final words about Nurse Love Addiction. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Nurse Love Addiction: I'm on the fence", "date": "08/09/2018", "text": "I'm slowly but surely getting bolder when it comes to romance games; and after cutting my teeth on your regular Otome game, I'm now ready to navigate more treacherous waters and broaden my romantic horizons in the process. And it so happened that Limited Run Games unknowingly supported those new endeavours of mine by releasing a physical version of yuri VN Nurse Love Addiction. The thing came with a hefty price tag of $ 50, which should totally have deterred me from purchasing it given that I was not even sure I would like it; but somehow, I was ready to take the risk. Fast-forward a couple of months, and NLA is now done and dusted. Did I like it, though? Well, kinda — although the things I liked about it were not what you might think of: I went in expecting a lacklustre VN with stellar romance, and what got instead was a stellar VN with lacklustre romance. Without further ado, let's get to the nitty-gritty of my NLA impressions, dear fellow gamers! (No spoilers involved, so feel free to read to your heart's content!)THE GOOD: That \"nurse\" in the title is more than just show: Despite (or maybe because of) both my parents being MDs, I have little interest in the medical profession beyond occasionally bingeing on Mystery Diagnosis episodes; but oh boy, did NLA make me wish I had given the medical field a go in my younger years. Kogado Studio went above and beyond the call of duty when it came to giving an accurate and faithful image of the nursing profession, and it's pretty obvious that they had an advisor all the way through. The game features lengthy lectures about the mundanities of being a nurse and doesn't try to sugar-coat anything, which means that unglamorous subjects such as hospital hygiene or the use of a bedpan will be touched upon. I found myself really engrossed by these well researched segments, so much so that I totally forgot that I was supposed to be here to woo cute girls and was genuinely surprised when romance suddenly popped up. Which leads us to...The build-up is out of this world: There's a rock-solid story at work there, a story that stands on its own even without taking the romance into account. I wouldn't step as far as to say that NLA is a VN first and a yuri game second, because getting to know the full extent of the story requires romantic entanglements; however, the game really takes its sweet time to establish things and make sure that we know the characters we're going to pursue. The nurse training setting is no mere excuse to bonk girls in white uniforms, indeed; we get to see plenty of the characters' routines and daily life long before the wooing process starts, which gives the whole story a homely and cosy vibe. Another excellent point is the fact that there is no true route and that all routes coexist without invalidating each other, which is no small feat given the number of plot twists involved. There's even a route solely dedicated to MC Asuka, in which she pursues her studies and ends up on her lonesome; and while this is not the most fascinating outcome of them all, it still stands up as a perfectly validpiece of story — as a matter of fact, it's one of my favourite routes. The production value are stellar: I'll admit it, I purchased that game first and foremost because I absolutely loved the art. I didn't even care about the story's quality — or lack thereof: all I wanted was to feast my eyes on these adorable girls and drink in those splendid soft colours. What I hadn't expected was to be swept away by the stellar voice acting and the gorgeous music, and to simply fall in love with the whole atmosphere of the game. The developers even took the time to refine the presentation and slide in lovingly crafted details; one such detail is the fact that each time you clear a route and go back to the title screen, the game's title is read aloud by the very character you ended up with — with a cheerful voice if you secured the good ending, or a dejected voice if you landed the bad ending. THE BAD:It's too yuri for its own good: How can a yuri game be too yuri, you may ask? Well, simply by taking for granted that all characters are lesbians and by eschewing any reference to anyone of the male persuasion. A reviewer for Gaming Age described NLA as \"the tender story of a young woman coming to terms with her sexuality\"; and as lovely as that description sounds, it couldn't be further from the truth. Asuka doesn't come to terms with her sexuality at all, because the game treats lesbianism as the default sexual orientation: the characters never display a shred of confusion, surprise or embarrassment at the mention of lesbianism, and they all pretty much act like girl-on-girl action is the most natural thing in the world. Even worse, the writers went out of their way to avoid showing males or even mentioning them: characters have sisters, female friends and 'parents' (supposedly both female) but brothers and fathers are nowhere to be found. Now I can imagine nursing schools not exactly brimming with men; but are you trying to sell me an hospital without a single male MD or patient or an anime convention devoid of male otakus, game? Does this game take place in our world, or in an all-female dystopia? If the latter is true, then it should be stated; and if the former is true, then the world and the characters' actions should be more consistent with what we're used to. Now don't get me wrong, dear fellow gamers: the last thing I want to find in my yuri VN is a social commentary on lesbianism. What I do want to find in any VN, on the other hand, is narrative consistency — and NLA painfully lacks some. No matter how you look at it, that game's story reads like the wild fantasy of a lesbian teenager who just cannot come to terms with the fact that 99% of humanity remain out of her bonking range. For 50 bucks, I certainly expect more than a slice of immature yuri fanfiction that can be found for free on the eponymous website, thank you very much. L'amour is just flat: One undesirable consequence of NLA's all-encompassing lesbianism is the total absence of any sort of tension in the love stories. Since romancing a girl is such an obvious thing in NLA's weird parallel world, there are no barriers to overcome in order to win the heart of your beloved and secure a happy relationship: no personal mental hurdles to conquer, no prejudices to fight against, no opposition from parents — just nothing. To say that this sorry state of affairs makes NLA's take on l'amour dreadfully boring is an understatement. This utter lack of stakes in the romance department is further worsened by the fact that characters seem to accept any sort of deviant relationship in a perfectly good-natured way. Incest, adultery, S&M, teacher-student relationship? Hey, no big deal! What matters is love, right? Heck no, game. Having my sister, my teacher or my classmate who already has a girlfriend make a pass at me is a very big deal indeed; and if you want your bloody romance game to be any thrilling, you should make sure that it comes across as such. Because the way things are, I simply cannot be bothered to root for all those vapid relationships that flow as effortlessly as a bunch of arranged marriages.Too much shock value: NLA is a game that tries way too hard to be clever and edgy, and it often comes across as gross or corny — or both. Like, I'm fine with the notion of Asuka giving mouth-to-mouth to her love interest right after said love interest vomited — I mean, this is a life-or-death situation and the characters are nurse trainees, right? What I'm not fine with, on the other hand, are lovingly detailed descriptions of how Asuka laps up — in every sense of the word — her love interest's vomit just because well, she loves her. Now that's disgusting, and utterly unrealistic to boot. Then you have those embarrassing scenes where Asuka and her lover du jour look each other in the eye and chant each other's names with increasingly breathless voices, complete with cheesy close-ups — right, I get it: you're getting horny and you're gonna bonk, okay, now stop it please. I won't quote any more examples to avoid treading on spoiler territory; but suffice it to say that NLA is a game that can ruin the mood in a single scene or sentence like no other VN I've read.At the end of the day, would I recommend NLA? Hard to tell, really. There's some good in this game, but there's also an awful lot of bad. In the end though, I still like it more than I dislike it; and I'll certainly replay it one day, if only for the enchanting atmosphere, the lovely chara design and art, the engrossing segments about nursing and the few endings I enjoyed. I'll see you soon with a route report brimming with spoilers, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be m guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sapphire: The Skitty Solo Run", "date": "30/08/2018", "text": "Despite cruising once with Skitty, I had some unfinished business with the pink kitten. Not only did my Skitty's Normalize rob me of most of the Type advantages I could have derived from her Move pool, but it also made my run a pure nighmare by making that all too normal feline unable to take down Ghost 'Mons. The truth is that Skitty's full potential didn't get to shine at all in that run, and I was left with a burning desire to give the kitten another well-deserved opportunity to shine on the battlefield. And since Skitty is a Gen III 'Mon and I haven't played much of that Gen yet, I decided to let the cute feline strut her stuff on her home ground.Having said that, it's quite ironic to see how painfully furtive Skitty is on her own turf. The pink kitten only has a 2% chance of appearing on Route 116, and I needed more than 100 encounters to even get a glimpse of a Skitty. It took so darn long that I started thinking that maybe I hadn't read properly when browsing Bulbapedia and that Skitty was not present in Sapphire after all. I was actually about to give up and turn my GBA off in sheer frustration when my Skitty finally appeared. Oh, the joy! And what a relief when that much-coveted, much-awaited Skitty turned out to be of the Cute Charm variety! My sister, who was holidaying with me and witnessed the recruitment of the cute feline, suggested the name 'Sakura' based on said cute feline's colour and overall cuteness; needless to say, that most fitting name was instantly adopted.I was initially planning to evolve Sakura, but the Gen III Skitty sprite is so utterly adorable that I found myself wanting to stick with it. On top of that, I had yet to tackle a solo run with a non-evolved 'Mon; and since I had already run with a fully evolved Skitty — albeit a slightly crippled one — the time was ripe and the occasion perfect. To my slight bewilderment, my little Sakura performed really well despite lacklustre stats. Even at lv. 85, most of her stats lounged lazily around the 100 mark — in fact, with a base Attack of 45 and base Sp.Attack of 35, Skitty is probably one of the weakest 'Mons I ever cruised with, if not the weakest. And yet, my little Sakura managed to one-shoot opponents quite smoothly and surprisingly often, which is quite a mystery to me. Are the Gen III games really that easy, or is Skitty just tailor-made for her home turf? Heck, even the Pokemon League was mostly a cakewalk, with only the Champion requiring a handful of Battle Items to bite the dust. And since we're touching on Skitty's battle prowess, the pink kitten is definitely a slow burner. She's pretty weak at first, with only a handful of crappy offensive Moves; and with her stats being as shitty as they are, she has to rely on vicious roundabout tactics to ensure victory — tactics such as Cute Charm and Attract, i.e. the most underhand Move ever created. Then, the feline slowly but surely grows into an offensive powerhouse, gaining access to really powerful Moves with a much greater Type coverage; that change is probably supposed to coincide with her evolution into Delcatty, although said evolution didn't happen in my run. Just compare my first Move pool, which comprised Faint Attack, Tackle, Covet and Attract, with my final Move pool made of Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Shadow Ball and Return, and you'll see the full extent of Skitty's potential for growth.   I loved Hoenn even more than when I played Emerald. Of all the Pokemon regions, it's probably the wildest and most untamed one, while still giving off a cute, wholesome and reassuring vibe. It's also really tiny and sweet, with my run clocking at roughly 11 hours when subtracting the hour of roaming required to recruit my Skitty. The pacing is probably the swifter I've seen in any Pokemon entry, with a constant and palpable sense of urgency pushing you forward; some might call that game rushed, but for a player who loves short and compact runs such as myself, this is just a complete blessing — not to mention that this unwavering focus on charging ahead greatly enhances that sweet, sweet dungeon crawling feeling I like to get from my Pokemon runs. And gosh, how I love not being forced to capture the resident Legendary and fight with it in order to progress! (I'm looking resentfully at you, X&Y. Oh, to think that you shove the Legendary at the helm of my team in lieu of my One and Only without asking me...) Even aquatic Routes were not that bad this time around, all the less so as I skipped large portions of them.So indeed, Skitty is perfectly at ease on her home turf; and despite her pitiful stats, she's great solo run material in her Cute Charm version. Incidentally, she's also one of my favourite 'Mons ever: not only is she an adorable kitten, but she's also an unassuming 'Mon that still gets the job done neatly on the battlefield. Some 'Mons out there have kick-ass stats, so you expect them to rock in battle and you just love them for their fighting prowess; but somehow, a passable 'Mon that still manages to pull off regular one-shooting and take down Pokemon League opponents with base stats three times higher is just as endearing, if not more. Taking a Flareon or an Absol all the way to the Elite Four is pretty much a given; a non-evolved Skitty, not so much. This is the kind of feat that makes you feel like a genuine Pokemon Trainer, who lovingly nurtures a 'Mon and helps them realize their full potential on the battlefield. And with that said, dear fellow gamers, my summer Pokemon spell comes to an end! Thanks for reading all those Pokemon adventures, and please be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Yellow: The Pikachu Solo Run", "date": "25/08/2018", "text": "My tatty, sweaty, sticky original cartridge. All the current talk about Pokemon Let's go made me curious about their source material, i.e. Pokemon Yellow. My gaming instinct was ever-so-slightly stirred, and I reasoned that the time was ripe to play that game. (More like a 'now-or-never' situation, really: given my dislike for Gen I and my recent purchase of FireRed and LeafGreen, there is virtually no guarantee that I'll ever want to play Yellow once the fuss about Let's go dies.) I went with lil' Pikachu as my One and Only — because indeed, what's the point of even playing Yellow at all if you're not gonna run with the sparkly mouse? So off we went, Wonderful Electric and I (I actually wanted to name him just like that — but alas, there were not enough slots available); and we soon found ourselves facing that most formidable obstacle, the one that's supposed to stop dead in their tracks any Yellow player who made the fatal mistake of relying on Pika-cute only: the Pewter Gym, lair of Brock and his Rock 'Mons. Now obviously, my little Etincelle — that's the name I settled for, and it means spark in french — only wielded three pathetic Moves at that time, namely Thundershock, Quick Attack and Tail Whip. Thundershock being virtually useless, I had to conquer that Gym with Quick Attack and Tail Whip only — talk about a tall order. The only strategy I could think of — and probably the only one that existed, for that matter — was to weaken Brock's 'Mons as much as possible by spamming Tail Whip, before wearing them down with Quick Attack. And blimey, it worked! And it was not even that much of an ordeal: sure, it was long and tedious, but Etincelle endured hits quite bravely and was never in real danger of fainting.Once that most infamous roadblock was behind us, cruising Kanto was easy-peasy. My electric ranger proved to be surprisingly resistant as well as quite strong, which surprised me after Alolan Raichu's poor performance on both defensive and offensive fronts. Gen I being, well, Gen I, I had to make do with the measliest of Move pool, made of Thunderbolt, Quick Attack, Swift and Mega Punch. Not that this Move diet stopped us from progressing, mind you: one-shooting was our bread and butter and we blazed through Kanto, leaving only fainted 'Mons and crying Trainers in our wake. Well, take that back: we didn't blaze through Kanto as much as we plodded through it. Yellow's pacing is every bit as horrible as Blue's one, and I had to backtrack and take detours so often that my run ended up bloated beyond belief, clocking at 15 bloody hours. Before we parted ways though, the game had one more nasty surprise in store for me: a final Gym and a Pokemon League bristling with Ground and Rock 'Mons. Why, thank you, game! You really don't want me to rely on Pikachu, now do you? Anyway, a whole lot of grinding and metric tons of Battle Items did the trick and I finally beat all those punks fair and square. Ooh, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love.  After playing Yellow, my verdict on Gen I remains the same: I still don't like those games — although not for the exact same reasons as when I played Blue, ironically. I took the inventory limitation, the terrible pacing and the general clunkiness and glitchiness in my stride this time around, only to be thoroughly bothered and troubled by yet another limitation: somehow, the Gen I entries don't feel like true-blue Pokemon games to me. This may sound like a ironic and even wildly ignorant statement, given that those games are the original Pokemon instalments; and yet, the opacity and abstruseness of the whole Move business in those games, the horrible HM management, the limited fauna and the constant herding of the player feel weirdly at odds with the spirit of the series. How are you supposed to manage your Moves, exploit the Type chart and fight efficiently when you cannot even check the nature and effects of Moves before your 'Mons learn them? How are you supposed to build up a well-oiled team when so few 'Mons can learn HMs and when you constantly encounter the same tired Rattatas and Pidgeys? How are you supposed to enjoy exploring and cruising around when you're constantly blocked by the most random obstacles and have to take a million detours in order to progress? In many ways, the Gen I games feel like a pre-evolution to the Pokemon series as we know and love it nowadays: everything is there, only half-baked and still in an embryonic state. It's certainly fascinating from a purely historical point of view; but when it comes to gameplay, latter Pokemon entries are undoubtedly more refined and fulfilling.As for Yellow in particular, I'll be blunt: it's a complete rip-off. What we have here is basically Red&Blue all over again, only with Pikachu at the helm and a couple of Jessie and James cameos. I guess that setup delighted many a fan of the anime who rejoiced in pretending they were Ash Ketchum fighting the evil Team Rocket, but that doesn't make Yellow less of a shameless cash grab. Ultra Sun&Moon took a lot of flak for not bringing enough novelties to the table, and yet they still bring ten times more than Yellow did. I'd be curious to know if Yellow was mauled by reviewers and branded as daylight robbery back in the days, or if the Pokemon honeymoon was still going full force and blinding Pokefans to the series' flaws.At any rate, that's one more Pokemon entry and one more solo run under my belt, and both managed to redeem the series' mascot after the Alolan Raichu semi-fiasco. But do you know what's most ironic, dear fellow gamers? Technically, I'm not even done with Pikachu yet. I still have to see how he performs as normal Raichu; and that means yet another Pikachu solo run, this time with a perfectly regular specimen recruited in tall grass. A solo runner's work is never done, indeed! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Back to business", "date": "24/08/2018", "text": "Hello again, dear fellow gamers! After a most refreshing holiday, I'm back to my daily grind — in every sense of the word. That being said, I did manage to get myself some quality gaming time during that holiday, which resulted in two more Pokemon solo runs that I'll cover here very soon. Summer and Pokemon are such a perfect match, indeed! But now comes september, and along with it a fresh new gaming wind: after a couple of months spent playing exclusively Nintendo handhelds, I've decided to swing back to Sony and give my PSP and Vita some much-needed love. And since I've done nothing but crawling&grinding these last months, I'll start these Sony Pony sessions by indulging in a couple of VN and puzzle games. See you soon for my last Pokemon solo runs of the summer, dear fellow gamers; and after that, let's sail together towards new and exciting gaming shores! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},

There won't be any post here for the next ten-or-so days, as I'm about to holiday abroad. I probably won't be able to indulge in any purchasing rampage — because where I go, there are no game stores. On the other hand, gaming will definitely follow me in the form of one of my many handhelds! I selected the GBA as my handheld of choice, because it's the tiniest handheld of them all and I like to travel light. I won't tell you which games will be part of the ride though, because I simply cannot promise that I will play them at all: for all I know, maybe those holidays will be super-busy and I won't lay a finger on my GBA's D-pad.

{"title": "Pokemon X: The Chesnaught Solo Run", "date": "28/07/2018", "text": "And with that, I covered all three Kalos Starters, making X and Y the third pair of games that gets the Full Starter Coverage treatment. Just four more Gens to go!  Little Chespin, resident Grass Starter of the Gen VI entries, could as well have been called 'Missed Opportunity' or even 'Giant Blunder'. His overall design, although inventive and cohesive, is so utterly repulsive that it tainted his whole legacy and probably deterred countless players from selecting him. Heck, I can honestly say that were I not so hell-bent on running solo with all Starters from all gens, I would never have touched the chesnut-meet-rodent creature in a million solo runs. And mind you, I'm still absolutely not sold on the Chespin line's designs and probably never will be; while I moderately like Chespin himself, Quilladin and Chesnaught were a constant insult to my retinas. However, I have to bow down to Chespin&evos when it comes to battle prowess; because let's face it, we're totally dealing with one of the best offensive Grass Starters ever created since the dawn of the series.It's fairly well known that GameFreak wanted the Kalos Starters to emulate traditional classes in RPG. In that regard, having the Grass Starter don the role of the Warrior/Paladin made perfect sense: trees can be associated with strength and solidity, while the intangibility of fire and the slipperiness of water makes them perfect fits for the Mage and Ninja classes respectively. Not only were those design choices beautifully spot-on, but they also treated us to a Grass Starter that's not a complete pushover on the battlefield. Chesnaught is a pure Physical powerhouse, with sky-high Attack and even higher Defense. That allows him to take a million hits comfortably while he obliterates foes, which beautifully compensate for his lousy Speed and make his whopping six Type weaknesses hardly noticeable. Chesnaught's double Grass/Fighting typing works really well on the battlefield, and he's treated to an absolutely stellar Move pool — another nice change for a Grass Starter. Chesnaught's levelling-up learnset comprises offensive Moves belonging to a whopping seven different Types; such variety is rare, even amongst Types that are traditionally more flexible than Grass when it comes to offensive coverage. I definitely had fun with my Chespin's Move pool, let me tell you that. It was already thrilling enough to handle powerful Grass Moves, which is something I don't get to do often since I hardly ever play with Grass 'Mons; but Chespin&evos also have access to other Moves that I had never handled before. Moves such as Take Down, Hammer Arm, Low Sweep or even Mud Shot quenched my thrist for Move experimentation and totally made my day — so much so that I didn't even feel compelled to use my beloved Return. After copiously switching between Moves, I finally settled on Seed Bomb (Grass), Take Down (Normal), Hammer Arm (Fighting) and Rock Tomb (Rock) in the late stages of my run. Once on Victory Road, I couldn't be arsed to make a detour to pick up Dragon Claw; and with hindsight, that was a bit of a mistake on my part. Wielding Dragon Claw instead of the rather weak Rock Tomb would undoubtedly have made my Elite Four showndown a trifle smoother, instead of the Battle Item-littered trudge it turned out to be. Oh, well. I was crowned Champion all the same in the end, and that's all that matters.Long story short: Chesnaught looks like shit, but he can strut his stuff like a boss on the battlefield. He can claim the honour of being my second favourite Kalos Starter when it comes to battle prowess: not quite as awesome as Delphox, but still way better than Greninja. And I have to admit that Chespin&evos somewhat renewed my faith in Grass Starters and made me want to try more of them. I sure hope that my next Starters Runs pack pleasant surprises on the Grass front! And as usual, dear fellow gamers: thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Greninja Solo Run", "date": "23/07/2018", "text": "I wanted to perform a speedrun of sorts with that particular playthrough, just to see how much I could squeeze my playtime on Gen VI; and boy, did that work well. At 10 hours and 15 minutes, my Greninja run is undoubtedly my shortest Pokemon solo run ever. And well, isn't that good to know that I can get a quickie run out of the Gen VI entries as well! Now I just have to check if I can perform the same kind of time compression in the Gen VII games. But not right now; for some reason, I developed some kind of aversion to everything Gen VII after my recent Ultra Sun & Moon playthroughs. Weird, really. But I digress. This post is all about Greninja, a beloved 'Mon if there ever was one; so beloved, in fact, that it was crowned Most Popular Pokemon in Japan and was granted a half-cringy, hald-badass exclusive transformation. I expected a lot from Kalos' resident Water Starter; and, well... Dare I say that I was a teeny-tiny bit disappointed? Yep, I'll say it: Greninja didn't live up to my expectations. It's not a bad 'Mon by any means, but it's not stellar either — at least in a solo run setting. Here are my two main issues with the ninja frog:—Greninja's double typing doesn't do him any favour. The addition of the Dark Type gives him three extra weaknesses compared to a pure Water Type; weaknesses that are, in my opinion, not quite compensated by the two resistances and the one immunity gained in the process. Sure, it's nice to be resistant to Ghost and Dark; but in a game that features no Dark and Ghost Gyms and very few 'Mons belonging to those types, it's a bit of a waste. As for the Psychic immunity, it'll probably only ever come in handy in the Anistar Gym. Fighting and Fairy 'Mons, on the other hand, are bloody everywhere in Kalos; and wouldn't it have been nice not to be weak to these two particular types. Greninja can also only learn a paltry two Dark Moves by levelling up; not too glorious, methinks. I daresay that the issue stretches beyond Greninja: so far, I have yet to encounter a 'Mon that profits significantly from secondary Dark typing. Either the secondary Dark type doesn't add anything and is treated as an afterthought, or it plainly hampers and weakens the involved 'Mon. I surmise that Dark works better on its own or as a primary Type in double typing — although I have yet to check that assumption by tackling solo runs with such 'Mons. —For a Starter, Greninja is surprisingly weak and slow-growing. He's afflicted with the lowest HP and defensive stats of the three Kalos starters; and while his offensive stats are pretty decent and balanced, his offensive prowess is hampered by the fact that his learnset comprises mostly weak Moves — like, Moves with an average power of 40-60. The poor frog can only learn three paltry Moves with a power above 60 through levelling up, and he has to wait until lv.49 for the first of those Moves to be handed to him. Ouch. Only in the very late stages of the game did I manage to put together a Move pool containing solely Moves with a Power of 80 and beyond, thus pretty much guaranteeing one-shooting; before that, well... I hardly ever one-shot anything unless a Type advantage was involved. Or unless I used Return, my eternal ace in the hole in solo runs.But enough complaining; my Greninja run was entertaining nonetheless, and the Kalos Water Starter does have undeniable qualities along his flaws: a varied learnset with good Type coverage, a sky-high speed that pretty much always offered me the first strike in battle on a silver platter, and an awesome and inventive overall design. Last but not least, he offered me a super-slick Elite Four showdown. With Surf (Water), Ice Beam (Ice), Extrasensory (Psychic) and Return (Normal) as my final Move pool, I was more than well armed to face the Kalos Pokemon League. I neatly took down Malva's Fire 'Mons, Wikstrom's Steel 'Mons and Drasna's Dragon 'Mons with Surf and Ice Beam; as for Siebold's and the Champion's teams, they were easily disposed of with Return. No Battles items, no fainting. At the end of the day, Greninja did the job, and that's all that matters. Now I just have to tackle a Chespin solo run, and I'll be done with the Kalos Starters! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Y: The Tyrantrum Solo Run", "date": "17/07/2018", "text": "Back to beautiful Kalos, for the second part of my fossil runs! I managed to squeeze my playtime even more and was crowned Champion after a mere 14 hours of roaming 'n' grinding. Not that shrinking my Pokemon solo runs is a goal per se, mind you; but it's undeniable that I like them better on the short side, a sweet and grindy treat that leaves me sated yet hungry for more. Honestly, I'd much rather have two 15-hours runs in a row than a single 30-hours run. But let's go back to the subject at hand, dear fellow gamers.Tyrunt is much more straightforward than his fellow fossil Amaura: he's a pure Physical Attacker, with the Attack and Ability to match. Although he doesn't have the widest Move pool of them all, he's granted sufficient Type coverage to take care of most of the Kalos fauna. My Tyrunt wielded four Moves belonging to four different Types during my whole run, and those Types were — amusingly — pretty consistent: Dark, Normal, Dragon and Ground/Rock. The evolution of my Move pool pretty much consisted in replacing my initial Moves with more powerful Moves of the same Type as I progressed — my final Move pool comprising Crunch (Dark), Return (Normal), Dragon Claw (Dragon) and Earthquake (Ground). I unfortunately had to renounce a couple of interesting Moves because they lacked precision or involved self-damage, all things that are hardly beneficial in a solo run. As for Type weaknesses, Tyrunt is afflicted with a whopping six, just like Amaura; however, unlike Amaura, Tyrunt doesn't have to deal with double Fighting and Steel weaknesses, and that made fights against 'Mons of those Types a bit less of a struggle.These two barebones, no-frills runs of X and Y allowed me to entirely reassess the Gen VI pair. I used to think that they were too darn long — and mind you, they were; however, they were too long only because I spent inordinate amounts of time doing things I didn't like much, things that didn't add anything valuable to my Kalos runs. Sure, Pokemon Amie is cute, but I don't play Pokemon for mini-games. Sure, being able to change my Trainer's attire is neat; but I don't care about fashion in real life, and neither do I in video games. Sure, fighting wild 'Mons gives good XP; but X and Y are so easy anyway that you can make it do just by fighting Trainers. Sure, Lumiose is the biggest Pokemon city ever created, with all sorts of fun places to visit; but if I want to stroll down fancy boulevards, I'd rather go to the real Paris, merci beaucoup. It all boils down to what I actually want to do in my Pokemon solo runs; and as it turns out, I want to grind and cruise regions in one fell swoop, from my modest hometown to the Elite Four summits. I totally approach and play Pokemon games like dungeon-crawlers: cute, mellow, heartwarming dungeon crawlers, but dungeon crawlers all the same, with each region acting as a giant self-contained dungeon. In that regard, the less fluff and diversions along the way, the better.Kalos also went through a well-deserved bit of rehabilitation in the process. Once I got rid of all the unecessary interruptions, I could at least feast my eyes on Kalos unhindered and take in the region's sheer beauty. And boy, is there a lot of eye-candy to be found there indeed. Kalos is undoubtedly the Pokemon region that offers the most variety in terms of landcape and decor: no town is similar to the next, no Route looks like the one that preceeds it, and even the interior design of houses is unique to each and every locale. Kalos features every possible type of landscape, from the traditional forests and grassy plains to more exotic locations such as mires, a rocky defile, french gardens and a windy steppe, without forgetting a bit of shoreline and what is probably the most gorgeous snowy area ever featured in a Pokemon game. Not only that, but Kalos also offers the most beautiful, well-designed and inventive Gyms in the whole series. They all take full advantage of the 3D to offer exciting puzzles and crawling, as well as splendid designs that are really easy on the retinas. GameFreak truly reached the apex of region and Gym design with Kalos; how sadly ironic, then, to see them drop all their progress on those fronts in the Gen VII games and revert to designs even more barebones than the ones featured in Gen I.At any rate, those runs gave me the precious opportunity to reassess the Gen VI games in the most glorious way. Soloing those games used to be a bit of a hassle; but thanks to all my clever tweaking, it's now pure, unadulterated pleasure. And that's an most excellent development indeed, because Kalos bristles with solo run candidates that are just itching to prove themselves on the battlefield. (My imagination running wild.) Expect much, much more Kalos goodness in the future, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon X: The Aurorus Solo Run", "date": "10/07/2018", "text": "If you have an eye for detail, dear fellow gamers, you might have noticed that I've played Pokemon X every summer for the last four years; and, well, this is no coincidence. See, I played the game first in june 2015 as I was staying at my beloved grandfather's place; I have the fondest memories of that trip, and those memories somehow coalesced and crystallized around Pokemon X. The dear old fellow has since passed away; but the memories and the game are still there, and I now replay X every summer to remember those precious moments. This summer is no exception, and that's how I found myself tackling yet another X solo run.I wanted that run to be a return to basics, a return to all the things I love about Pokemon. I have a complicated relationship with the 3DS entries: although I love them dearly, they usually fail to enthrall and satisfy me as much as the DS and GBA entries. I reckon that this sorry state of affairs is solely due to the sheer length of the 3DS games: soloing them routinely takes around 20 hours, and that's a good 5 hours too much as far as I'm concerned. A good shearing was in order, and that's exactly what I decided to do during that playthrough. The formula was simple: no touching Pokemon Amie (I ignored the feature entirely during my first run of X anyway and things turned out just fine), Repel in all caves and tall grass areas, no shopping for clothes, Potion-gobbling on the road to avoid backtracking to Pokemon Centres, no exploring Lumiose City and, last but not least, an unwavering focus on Gyms and dungeons. It worked like a charm, with my run clocking at 16 hours and being my most enjoyable playthrough of X/Y so far.My lone 'Mon du jour was Amaura, one of Kalos' two resident fossils. It boasted a double Ice/Rock typing that was unusual and thus interesting, but also promised a bit of a challenge on the battlefield: with six weaknesses including a double weakness to Fighting and Steel, battling could easily get hairy. And, well, it did get hairy. The first roadblock was the Lucario fight in Geosenge, which I won using a purely defensive strategy: give Amaura the Rocky Helmet, then use an X Defense on the first turn to survive Lucario's first hit; then, heal on every turn while Lucario hurts himself to death on the Rocky Helmet. Kinda underhand; but hey, it worked. After that first hurdle, the rest of the Type obstructions was easily dealt with: rely on my boosted speed to one-shoot Fighting and Steel 'Mons before they can hit me, use the Rocky Helmet when necessary, occasionally bypass Trainers, and gobble X Defenses during the Elite Four fight against Wikstrom. All in all, cruising Kalos with Amaura was actually much smoother than I expected, due to his decent and balanced stats and powerful Moves.And since I'm mentioning Moves, I was a bit surprised by Amaura's orientation in that department. Instead of being an Sweeper or a Tank, as I hoped, he's a Status effect caster with a couple of offensive Special Moves thrown on top and the high Sp. Attack to match — think Male Meowstic rather than Charizard. I literally only wielded two Move pools during my whole run: Icy Wind, Aurora Beam (Ice), Round (Normal) and Ancient Power (Rock) in the first half of the game, and then Ice Beam (Ice), Thunderbolt (Electric), Return and Hyper Beam (Normal) in the second half. But wait, there's a catch: because of Amaura's Refrigerate Ability, all my Normal Moves automatically became Ice Moves. This means that I played the whole game with three Ice Moves at all times, which could have been a recipe for disaster; but surprisingly enough, it was not. I was never in a pinch on the battlefield, and my Amaura always hit hard enough to take down even 'Mons resistant to Ice. I had a Flying Hidden Power in my inventory just in case, but I never needed to resort to it. With the 'refrigerated' version of Return, I had access to an extremely powerful and precise Physical Ice Move, which was definitely an ace in the hole against many a 'Mon with low Defense. Despite its vast array of weaknesses, Amaura is a nicely polyvalent 'Mon that can probably fit in all manners of teams: he's a Status effect and Weather caster that can take hits, strike back with a vengeance and resist both Hail and Sand Storm. And as my run abundantly proves, he's also great solo run material. Well done, you.My Amaura solo run might be over, but I'm far from being done with Kalos. Now that X and Y are back in my good graces, I can plot all the solo runs I want in that Frenchiest of Pokemon regions — starting with a run of Y starring Amaura's counterpart and polar opposite Tyrunt. See you soon for more Kalos goodness, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2: All's well that ends well", "date": "03/07/2018", "text": "162 hours, 24 minutes and 44 seconds. I was right when I said last that there was not much left to do and that the end of my run was nigh. After having maxed out all my Rare Blades' affinity charts, I went back to the story and quickly found myself facing the last boss. It turned out that my crew towered a good 30 levels over said last boss, which made that ultimate showdown a complete cinch of a fight. I was a trifle disappointed by that easy victory, so I tried again in Normal Mode; that didn't make the fight any harder, just considerably longer. I'm glad I played the whole game in Easy Mode and saved myself copious amounts of fighting; had I played in Normal, I would probably still be stuck in Mor Ardain.That being said, I'm a bit saddened by this abrupt ending; because the truth is that I wanted to play more. I wanted to fulfill more sidequests, grind more Rare Blades, explore more dungeons and areas, kill more Unique Monsters. Of course, I could still tackle a New Game +, which comes with heaps of benefits and lets you carry over pretty much everything you've gained over the course of your first run; but with the game being still so incredibly fresh in my mind, I just don't feel like restarting right now — all the less so as I already restarted the game a couple of weeks ago. So I'll just leave it at that for the time being, and carefully preserve my save file for a future playthrough on steroids.My, what a fine playthrough this was. I love everything about that game, from the thrilling fighting system to the enchanting atmosphere, without forgetting the sidequests, Rare Blade management and dungeon crawling. I only have three real beefs with XC2, and I'll mention them quickly for fairness' sake:The soundtrack: Yeah, I know everybody raves about that game's OST, and even I have to admit that we're dealing with high-class music there; however, that stellar soundtrack didn't make me feel anything. I cannot even think of a track that I genuinely liked from beginning to end. But hey, that's just me, not the music itself; it's similar to the way Mozart leaves me cold while Bach makes me feel all mushy inside. The graphics: It's no secret that I'm a retro whore and that I abhor photorealism in video games. Monolith Soft's attempt at photorealism in XC2 obviously doesn't sit well with me: not only does it make the game boring to look at, but it also interferes with the gameplay. It's much less pleasant and cathartic to kill realistic-looking foes than highly pixelated ones: it ruins that sweet, sweet RPG immersion and leaves you soon wandering why the heck you're slaughtering the whole fauna of the world you're supposed to care for. The story (SPOILERS): Too much nonsensical fluff, too many deus ex machina, too many cheesy lines, too much telling instead of showing, too much eye-rolling emotional porn, too many ideas lifted straight from Gunnm (up to the orbital station connected to the planet by an elevator). That story was bloated beyond belief and could have used some serious shearing. Just drop the whole Torna shebang, Jin and his shitty crew, the war from 500 years ago that no one cares about and Pyra's useless alter egos; the search for Elysium in order to save humanity from a certain death, spearheaded by a Pyra who just wanted to go back home, would have been more than enough to carry that game all the way through. All the sparing and political intrigues between regions would have provided ample amounts of bosses (cue Bana's scheming and the Tirkin 'conspiracy'), and the story would have been much more mature and elegant. And we could have had an touching reunion between Pyra and Rex at the end, instead of seeing him fidget and ponder which girl he should hug and kiss first. (END OF SPOILERS)But make no mistake, dear fellow gamers: XC2's pros largely outweight its cons in my book. I could rave on endlessly about the things I love in that gem of a game: the icy, etheral landscape of Tantal and its high-level monsters that only appear when the land is shrouded in fog, the auroras in Leftheria, the dusty grittiness of Mor Ardain, the way huge weapons feel genuinely heavy when your MC swings them, the flexibility of the fighting system that lets you mix and match fighting options and play it your way (I was all about Driver Combos during my first run, and rolled solely with Blade Combos during my second run), the highly adjustable difficulty level, my sidekicks' stellar intelligence in battle (my jaw dropped when I first realized that they could switch Blades on their own — I didn't even think that was possible!), the mouth-watering names of all the food on offer, the mellow vibe at night, the fact that I could fight the last boss with Morag instead of Rex — and many, many more things. It's safe to assume that I'll replay XC2 at some point, all the more so as my Switch library is shaping up to be quite tiny indeed. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2: 150 hours", "date": "01/07/2018", "text": "Playing XC2 has become a bit of a soothing habit over time: I pick up the game, grind until I'm sated, and turn it off until the next day. Now I understand better how people can pour hundreds of hours into MMORPG or long-winded games à la Skyrim; once you get into that sweet grinding rhythm, it's really easy to keep going. The question is, will my XC2 playthrough beat my 200-hours Dragon Quest IX playthrough and become my newest longest run ever? It would be sweet, but I'm not too sure this will happen. I'm slowly but surely running out of things to do; and since I'm currently standing at the beginning of chapter 10, wrapping up the story will probably require but a mere couple of hours. Just for you, dear fellow gamers, here's a summary of all the neat and nice things I managed to accomplish in the last 50 hours.—I developed all areas to the max; and as I promised, I did it without resorting to FAQs. I can safely say that I managed to pinpoint the requirements for developing, and that they are pretty similar for all areas: explore, talk to people, do merc missions, clear side quests, and most importantly, buy and sell a LOT of stuff. I got my paws on all the available Deeds (except the one from that Torigoth shop that's tied to a side quest triggered by a Rare Blade I don't own) and boy, do they make things smoother and nicer indeed. Faster running speed, better item drops, larger item collecting range — you name it, the Deeds will provide it to you. Most definitely worth the hassle and spending, oh yes precious. —I expanded my roster of Rare Blades, with only Kassandra, KOS-MOS and Dahlia still missing. Not bad for somebody who wasn't even planning on collecting Rares, methinks. And since I got hold of all these nice Blades, why not max out their affinity charts while I was at it? That's exactly what I'm been doing for the past 50 hours, and it was tremendously fun. Although requirements can be a tad repetitive at times (\"Kill monster x in place y\" was visibly a developer's favourite), they are nicely varied and entertaining for the most part. The difficulty variation was also a nice touch, with some Blades requiring significantly more work than others. My personal top 3 of high-maintenance Blades comprises Ursula, who required days of Merc Mission grinding; Boreas, who required a crap ton of foraged items; and last but not least, Sheba, who required no less than a bloody million gold. Fun anecdote, by the way: I was about to start grinding Sheba just as I got the Nopoon Doublon side quest, which also requires a hefty amount of money. I needed two millions for those two tasks; and as I checked my balance, I saw that I had only roughly 800,000 golds. Grumbling a little bit, I proceeded to farm more money — until I realised half an hour later that I had read too fast and that I owned not 800,000 golds as I though, but 8 bloody millions golds. I swear I had no idea how I got so filthy rich; the last time I had checked my balance seriously, I had something like 600,000 golds. Grinding for hours in side quests sure pays off, ain't it? —My whole crew reached the big 99, which is a tad disappointing but also strangely relaxing. My active fighting party is pretty much set, with Morag as my MC and Zeke and Nia as my sidekicks. I use Rex solely when I need to grind his Blades, and I all but ditched poor Tora: the little chap has not been strutting his stuff on the battlefield for dozens of hours. Although he was doing a great job in the early stages of the game, he became a giant gimmick as time went on — a time-consuming, high-maintenance gimmick. Not only is he stuck with the three versions of Poppi only, but I cannot even max out the affinity charts of said Poppies because there's some heavy Tiger Tiger playing involved. Why should I even bother with that pervy Nopon and his measly three blades when Morag does as good a job as him as a tank? —I slaughtered all Unique Monsters so far, apart from a nasty pair that are still too powerful for my party: the lv. 100 Driver in the Cliffs of Morytha and the lv. 130 creature in Temperentia. There's nothing quite like that feeling of accomplishment you get when you finally take down such powerful foes after a long and arduous fight. Now I understand better why Monster Hunter is so immensely popular.And that's the gist of my XC2 adventures for the time being, dear fellow gamers. Unless I'm sorely mistaken, I'm probably getting close to the end of my playthrough. I'm not planning to farm Core Crystals in order to gain the three Rares I'm still missing; and since I only have two Rares left to grind, max levels and a paltry single chapter to polish off, my run might very well come to an end in the next days. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon LeafGreen: The Charizard Solo Run", "date": "26/06/2018", "text": "After 50 hours of Ultra Sun&Moon's bloated story and tutorial galore, I suddenly found myself craving some simplicity. What I wanted was a quickie Pokemon solo run, with as little narrative fluff as possible yet metric tons of grinding. The only entry in my collection that seemed to fit the bill perfectly was Blue and its endless rows of idle Trainers; but alas, I just couldn't see myself suffering through that glitchy mess again, even for the sake of grinding. But then came the illumination, as I suddenly remembered the existence of the FireRed and LeafGreen GBA remakes. I had never bothered hunting for them because of the battery hassle and the ever-present risk of landing a bootleg; but now, that pair suddenly seemed like the most desirable games in the world to my hungry gamer's soul. (Like pretty much every single game I covet, until the next one comes into the picture — but that's another story.) The gaming instinct had spoken, and there was nothing to do but cave in and order a copy of LeafGreen from a reliable seller. A couple of days later, the precious cartridge was mine and I dove into a Charmander solo run with gusto.The next best thing to a Legendary.I have to admit that Charmander's insane popularity amongst Pokefans always eluded me — that is, until I roamed revamped Kanto with that first and most beloved Fire Starter of them all. Oh boy, is Charmander utterly, totally, ludicrously broken. He boasts ridiculously high stats, and has access to the most insanely enormous Move Pool I've ever had the pleasure of being granted access to. Moves were raining on me so consistently that I started making lists, in the hope of conveying the sheer enormity of that Move indulgence. First, here's the list of all the offensive Moves my Charmander wielded over the course of my run: Amber, Scratch, Mega Punch, Metal Claw, Flamethrower, Brick Break, Secret Power, Wing Attack, Slash, Return, Earthquake, Dragon Claw and Overheat. And then, here's the list of the Moves I could have learnt yet decided to renounce for various reasons: Mega Kick, Dig, Rock Slide, Seismic Toss, Dragon Rage, Fire Spin, Fly, Cut, Steel Wing, Fire Blast, Blast Burn, Rock Smash, Strength and Double-Egde. Pretty outrageous, ain't it? I never had access to that many Moves in a solo run ever, and I totally lapped up that insane Move pampering. Although I'm still not fond of the looks of the whole Charmander family, I'm definitely on board with the Charmander aficionados out there when it comes to the kantonian Fire Starter's battle prowess. Mind you, little Charmy here is supposed to act as a hard mode of sorts for the Kanto games, being weak to the types handled by the first two Gym Leaders; but honestly, this famed hard mode was no sweat at all in my run. My Charmander learnt Metal Claw right before the Rock Gym; with Rock being weak to Steel and my Charmander being much faster than basically any Rock 'Mon, that engagement was easy-peasy. I got Mega Punch right before the Water Gym; a bit of extra grinding on route 24 and 25's Trainers, and I was pretty much set. As for the rest, well... Once I got rid of these two typing roadblocks, it was pretty much one-shooting till the end. The original Red/Blue games were probably a bit harder, since Metal Claw wasn't a thing back then; but I have no doubt that Charmander's high Attack and Speed, combined with the overlevelling inherent to running solo, could take care of the Rock Gym no matter what. Not that I'm planning to put that theory to the test, mind you: now that I discovered those amazingly good Gen I remakes, there's no way I'm ever going back to Blue.As for my overall impressions of LeafGreen, they can be summed up in one sentence: The Gen Oners have a point. Indeed, when you peel off the glitches, cumbersome gameplay mechanics and graphical blotches of the Kanto entries, you suddenly uncover mighty fine games. LeafGreen delivers the essence of the Pokemon experience and does away with all the bloating and fluff that was added in subsequent gens: it's compact, straightforward and perfectly wholesome. It's a lovely, soothing game with a cute pint-sized world and a comfy vibe; and yet, it's not afraid of roughing you up all the way through. LeafGreen is probably the grindiest Pokemon entry I've ever played, with so many Trainers lounging around that I routinely ran out of PP when cruising between towns — and as you may imagine, I lapped the whole thing up. I'm especially fond of the fact that most Trainers have at least 3 'Mons, and often up to 5; I just hate challenging Trainers only to discover that they have one measly Pokeball in their arsenal, which is something that happens way too often in recent instalments. (Why do you even engage me with your pet 'Mon, you amateur?) And after a slew of wishy-washy rivals, it was deliciously refreshing to be pitted against Gary and with dirty mouth. (I'm getting bored of friendly rivals in Pokemon: give me aggressive twats again, so I can rejoice in wipping the floor with them!) Last but not least, I just love the simple yet charming graphics, and most especially the stylized battle backgrounds, which in my opinion are much more unique and pleasing to look at than those figurative, 360-degree battle arenas the series has forced on us since X/Y.At the end of the day, LeafGreen is the game that made me fall head over heels in love with Kanto — so much so that I promptly ordered FireRed, as well as a GBA link cable to trade 'Mons and expand my solo run horizons. But those are stories for future posts, dear fellow gamers; for now, I'll wrap things up by saying that my Charmander solo run of LeafGreen was one of the most excellent runs I've ever had with a Fire Starter. It was just as hectic, intense and satisfying as my Tepig solo run of White 2, with the added benefit of a huge Move pool. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Nintendo Switch: Two months, second thoughts - The software side", "date": "22/06/2018", "text": "Welcome back, dear fellow gamers, for the second part of my Switch rant. After covering my (numerous) hardware issues with the system, it's now time to delve into the software variable of the disaffection equation. To put it simply (and a tad pompously), Nintendo's newest offering doesn't fit gracefully into my collecting and gaming ecosystem. This might sound a bit vague; so let's go into details, dear fellow gamers.  —Although the prospective Switch lineup had me all hyped up for a while, I'm starting to realize that the Switch's brand of gaming isn't bound to add anything unique and valuable to my gaming regimen. From what we've seen so far, the Switch will offer two types of titles: sleek, HD home console-ish games à la Xenoblade 2, and low-fi, budget games à la Lost Sphear. The former is not my cup of tea, like, at all. It's not secret that I'm a retrogamer at heart and that I mostly despise modern gaming and its obsession with bloated open worlds, plasticky HD and boring hyper-realism — and sure, I love Xenoblade 2 to pieces; but that's despite its home-consoleness, not because of it. As for the latter, I already have it, like, by the truckload. My collection is full to the brim with all sorts of nichey, budgety, low-fi games, and I simply have no need for more at that point. Sure, The Lost Child looks like something I'd like to play; but how is it any different from my vast array of Vita first-person dungeon crawlers? Spoiler alert: it's no different at all, because this is actually a Vita port. Mind you, this is part of an even bigger problem: one year after the system's release, Switch gaming hasn't managed to carve its own niche and is still entirely derivative. See, I own five true-blue handhelds, and they all offer their own distinctive brand of gaming; the Switch, on the other hand, seems content to emulate other consoles and bring nothing original to the table. Just look at the current library: WiiU, 3DS and Vita ports, indies already released on other platforms, and 'HD' games that would have been perfectly at home on the PS3. Sure, I said I wanted a successor to the Vita and the 3DS; but I didn't mean a copycat that would churn out the exact same games, thank you very much. —The average Switch game is too pricey for my taste. Sure, I kinda expected high prices, since the Switch is an hybrid console; but seeing those inflated price tags in shops really drove the point home and made me balk at the prospect of purchasing metric tons of Switch games. On top of that, I'm very much reaching my spending limits when it comes to games, mostly due to the way my collecting unfolded. I started collecting for the DS and the PSP and was spoiled rotten by cheap second-hand games; then came the 3DS and Vita with brand-new titles, making my collecting endeavours more pricey and tedious. Now, the Switch is coming with even pricier games, and let's face it: I'm not ready to swallow yet another increase in prices and tediousness. At this rate, I'd rather keep collecting for the 3DS and Vita at a slower, more relaxed pace — because let's face it, those systems still have some gaming goodness to offer. —As the proud owner of GBA, DS, PSP, 3DS and Vita systems, I have access to three generations of handhelds already — even four, if you count the handful of Game Boy games I own. This seriously undermines what could have been one of my main motivations for building up a Switch collection, namely the prospect of playing the newest entries of my favourite series. With my precious collection containing series that span two to four generations of handhelds, I have very little need for more instalments. Sure, I'd like to play the Switch Pokemon games; but if I had to make do with the games I already own till the end of time, I honestly wouldn't mind at all. I would mind all the less as I love my gaming on the retro side and tend to replay games on the long run. —Last but not least, I have to listen to the voice of reason for a change. My precious collection is already absolutely massive as it is; so massive, in fact, that there's virtually no guarantee that I can even manage to play all the games I own before I lose interest or kick the bucket. Common sense dictates that I should stop the bullsh*t and focus on the games I already own instead of purchasing even more games I'm not sure I'll ever play — and for once, I'm actually in the mood to humour common sense. Mind you, that sudden burst of moderation and self-restraint is very much helped by the fact that my collecting drive is nearly extinct after five years of frantic collecting.All in all, my software issues with Ninty's newest piece of kit can be summed up in two words: diminishing returns. The Switch simply cannot bring me as much joy, satisfaction and fulfillment as its predecessors, neither on the playing side nor on the collecting side. Now, does this mean that I'm planning to give up on the Switch entirely? Not quite. I will purchase Switch games in the next years allright; but I'll be much more careful when doing so. I'll stop taking chances on anything ressembling an RPG and invest solely in games I'm 100% sure I can enjoy; and I certainly won't put together a huge Switch collection. In fact, I'm not even approaching the Switch as a collector, but rather as a gamer who wants to play a good game once in a while and leave it at that. Heck, I may even step as far as to resell used Switch games to get funds for new ones. I had reservations about the Switch at first and saw it as yet another clunky and overly complicated Nintendo home console, then I was seriously hyped up about it and saw it as the saviour of handheld gaming; now, after getting my paws on it, I see it as a mere regular gaming system, which happens to have little to offer me. I'll thus keep enjoying my vast soon-to-be-retro collection, with a Switch game as a diversion every now and then. There you have it, dear fellow gamers: my own personal Switch epopee, a.k.a. To the Switch and Back. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Nintendo Switch: Two months, second thoughts - The hardware side", "date": "18/06/2018", "text": "It's not secret that I bought my fair share of consoles over the course of my gaming life. That mass of consoles can be roughly divided into two categories: the much-wanted systems that ultimately failed to meet my lofty expectations, and the not-so-wanted systems that ultimately exceeded my meagre expectations. The latter category contains luminaries such as the Game Gear, a.k.a. my former Favourite Console Ever, the Vita, a.k.a. my newest Favourite Console Ever, and the DS and PSP, a.k.a the kings of portable RPG that masterfully blend the best of both retro and modern gaming. In the former category, we have the Game Boy, which I loved yet also came to resent because of how high-maintenance it was when it came to lighting conditions; the GBA, which I cannot play without getting some horrid hand cramping; the Mega Drive, which failed to give me the same sweet intimacy as handhelds; and, last but not least, the Switch.It pains me greatly to admit it, but my initial love for the Switch is unfortunately wasting away. I though I had gotten my hands — literally — on a winner of a system and yet another first-class addition to my already respectable collection of handhelds; but alas, all the things that seemed so appealing when I was longing for the Switch from afar proved to be less than dazzling when seen up close. As the title implies, there are two sides to that coin of disaffection; let's start with the nitty-gritty of my hardware issues with the Switch, dear fellow gamers. (Also, because I can't be bothered to take pictures of my Switch, those posts will be adorned with XC2 screenshots.)—The matte plastic used for the back of the Switch's tablet is literally the worst plastic I've laid my hands upon on any console, ever. It's like Nintendo went out of their way to handpick the material that would gather the most finger grease. I don't have particularly oily fingers, and I never snack when playing; and yet, after a mere two months and less than 200 hours of use, my Switch is already adorned with big fat greasy stains on all the places that come into regular contact with my fingers. Needless to say, all that unwelcome greasiness looks and feels utterly gross. Now of course, the Vita and the DS are also prone to grease staining; but rubbing the offending spots usually leaves your console clean as new. Not so with the Switch: you can rub all you want, the grease just. won't. bulge. This means that alcohol-based cleaning solutions are probably needed, which could be fatal to my Switch's coating — not to mention that I have better things to do than put the thing through a special cleaning therapy every couple of weeks. And then we have the analog sticks: instead of gathering grease, they gather every fleck of dust, dead skin or random crap that happens to be on your fingers; and once again, once something is stuck there, good luck wiping it away. This whole situation is just infuriating, and it boggles my mind that such materials were chosen and used for the Switch. —The Switch feels too fragile for my taste. Mind you, I'm not saying that just because my Switch's left Joy-Con happened to be a bit loose right out of the box; that fragility issue is inherent to the system's design. Joy-Cons are bound to get loose over time no matter what, until playing becomes really uncomfortable or (worse) connectivity simply stops working entirely. This means that the Switch might become unplayable on the long run simply due to its very design; and after a whole lifetime spend playing systems that were designed as monuments of solidity, that sudden reversal of gaming fortune really stings. —The Switch painfully lacks compactness and elegance. It just doesn't feel like a solid, real handheld — probably because it's not a true-blue handheld. For all intents and purposes, the Switch is but a tablet with two controllers stuck on the sides; it's a weird and unappealing mix of different parts that doesn't feel like a wholesome gaming system. The handheld aficionado and veteran in me just cannot fancy that big, blocky, disjointed mess of a console that lacks all the grace and solidity of a genuine handheld. On top of that, the Switch is simply too large and heavy not only for my own taste, but also to qualify as a genuine handheld. Sure, you can carry it around; but you can carry your laptop around as well, and yet you'd be hard-pressed to call it a portable gaming system. —The Switch has a way of getting uncomfortably hot during long playing sessions, especially on the right side. I even had to give up on playing a couple of time and let the system cool down because it was simply getting too hot to hold. Needless to say, it's all but impossible to play the Switch when it's charging, as it gets even more searingly hot.—The Switch's battery management is pure hassle. It's already annoying enough that the Switch has such poor battery life, forcing me to charge it literally every day; but that's not even my main battery-related issue. No, my main issue lies in the darn annoying Sleep Mode. Because the Switch cannot be completely turned off unless you go through a complicated and utterly unintuitive process, most of us will simply put their Switch in sleep mode and call it a day. But wait, there's a catch: sleep mode keeps draining your Switch's battery, and rather fast at that. So you didn't touch your Switch for a week after fully charging it? Too bad, now it's empty! Just say goodbye to your planned gaming session and go charge it again, sucker. (Yup, this is totally first-hand experience.) So, the GBA, DS and Vita can hold battery power for weeks on end, even months; but the Switch has to be kept on a constant charging diet? Not too convenient for an 'hybrid' console, methinks.   —Last but not least, I have a more general beef with the Switch, one that's entirely based on my collector's instinct: I feel that the Switch was not designed with longevity and perennity in mind, which is an absolute first for a Nintendo portable console — and maybe even for a Nintendo console full stop. I've handled and played every single Nintendo handheld, from Game&Watches to the 3DS, and I could always genuinely feel the sheer solidity and robustness of those systems: they were designed to last years and endure enormous amounts of abuse from careless hands. The Switch, on the other hand, doesn't ooze solidity and robustness at all, but rather feels like a fancy toy that's bound to break before you're through with it. As a collector, I very much have an issue with that approach. I just don't want to invest my funds and affections in a console that was so obviously designed as a disposable, one-generation-only piece of kit — something to be picked, played, used until it breaks and then ditched and forgotten as the newest piece of kit enters the picture. Granted, that approach has been running rampant on the home console scene for some years now; but I always thought (and hoped) that Nintendo would stay away from it and keep treating us to consoles designed to last. Alas, it seems they've been contamined at last by the industry's dirty built-in obsolescence ways.  At the end of the day, I think reality simply caught up with me. As a handheld aficionado, I really wanted the Switch to inherit the 3DS and Vita's legacy and perpetuate the strong, long-running Nintendo handheld tradition; but alas, it seems that this dream scenario is not meant to be. The Switch is a home console after all; and like all current home consoles, it's flimsy, fussy and not designed to last. Well, fine; I was fooled once, but I won't be fooled twice. There won't be extra backup Switches for me; I'll use my current Switch until it dies, and then it's game over — literally. But what about all those Switch games you were so excited about a few weeks ago, you may ask? Don't you want to collect them? Well, about that... Things have changed, shall we say. But that's a subject I'll cover in the soon-to-come second part of that Switch rant, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},

I have post subjects lined up, but I just cannot bring myself to sit in front on my computer and write a word. I spent the last few days trying to coerce myself into writing, but to no avail; as a result, I decided to call it quits and take a couple of days off.

{"title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2: 100 hours", "date": "27/05/2018", "text": "I abandoned the story some 30 hours ago, somewhere at the beginning of chapter 8; and since then, I've been doing nothing but sidequests. It's nearly ridiculous how all the secondary stories about Blades and NPCs are ten times more engrossing and touching than the main story; but at least, that makes for really good sidequesting. I just love seeing regions develop and evolve, discovering my Blades' backstories and personalities through exclusive Blade quests and checking every now and then on NPCs I helped back in the early stages of the game. The main story might be the game's backbone, but the sidequests and secondary stories are undeniably the delicious, juicy meat around that backbone.My plan for the time being is to grind my Rare Blades and fill up their affinity charts as much as possible. I managed to rack up a pretty decent roster, with only seven Rare Blades still eluding me. I'll be glad if they join the fray before I'm done with the game, but I certainly won't go out of my way to secure them — not with the RNG being as unfair and screwed as it is in XC2. I already have enough to do with my current roster, trust me. I really love the variety of requirements for the Rare Blades' affinity charts: from grinding Merch Missions to killing exclusive monsters by the truckload (hello Zenobia), without forgetting collecting, quests and heart-to-hearts, there's enough variety there to ensure that you'll never get bored grinding your Rares.And since I'm on the Rare Blade subject, I have to admit that most of the designs disappoint me. A couple of them are really original and interesting, granted; but for the most part, they're really vanilla and too anime-ish for my taste. Also, why are there so many female Rare Blades, why do male Rare Blades look more often than not like they're not male, and why is Dromarch the only animal Rare Blade? That lack of variety really hurts the Rare Blades roster; it's hard to be enthusiastic about discovering a new Rare when you're 95% sure it's gonna be yet another luridly-clad female. Also, a piece of my soul died when I read aloud the name of Poppi's third form for the first time and realized the cheesy, corny, lousy pun lurking there. Oh, well. That's what you get when you play RPGs marketed towards gamers young enough to be your own children, I guess. Thanks to all that questing, my party is massively overleveled, with everybody lounging now in the mid-80s. That sure helps tremendously for sidequests, since most bosses and rares monsters involved in said sidequests can only boast a puny level 50-60. Easy-peasy! If I had to nitpick though, I'd said that it pisses me off to see Rex stall behind and level-up slower than the rest of the crew. Is he the bloody hero or not? Is it because he's the youngest here? Oh well, nevermind; I don't care that much anyway, since I've been playing with Morag for the last 40 hours. Oh, how I wish she could have been the hero of that sorry story instead of virgin boy Rex. I'm gonna hang onto her as long as I can, let me tell you that; and if I can get away with slaughtering the last boss with her, then I'll sure as heck do just that. But hey, not now! I still have plenty of quests to polish off, and I'll get back to the grind as soon as I finish that post. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Ultra Sun: The Alolan Raichu Solo Run", "date": "20/05/2018", "text": "It had to happen, dear fellow gamers: I had to put the sparkly face of the franchise, the most iconic and recognizable 'Mon of them all, through the solo run test. Or more like wringer in that particular case; but more on that very soon.It pains me to admit that, but Pikachu is not good solo run material overall. In my personal solo run chart, he'd probably lounge somewhere on the mid-tier, around 'Mons such as Liepard and Rowlett — not horrible, but not stellar by any means either. Pikachu suffers from a bad case of limited offensive Move pool, so much so that I had to hang onto the same four Moves for most for my run — namely Grass Knot (Grass), Brick Break (Fighting), Psychic and Thunderbolt (Electric). Granted, that Move pool allowed me to dispose of most of the local fauna; but gosh, did it get boring to spam those four Moves after a while. Both Pikachu and Raichu are also afflicted with low HP and a truly abysmal Defense stat, which were a genuine thorn in my side during my whole run. I quickly lost count of the number of times my Electric lone ranger fainted, knocked out cold by a 'Mon with sky-high Attack. And it's not like he got to one-shot 'Mons with abandon, oh nooo: even in the late stages of the game and towering 15 to 20 levels above opponents, one-shooting was not guaranteed. I could never rest on my laurels with that most famous 'Mon of them all, and I had to strategize up until the last battle — which was interesting, but definitely not relaxing.As for Alolan Raichu specifically, he's terrible solo run material — that is, in Alola. The entire issue stems from his double Typing: Pikachu gains the Psychic Type upon evolving into Alolan Raichu, which slaps three extra weaknesses on top of his Ground weakness. Those extra weaknesses happen to be Ghost, Dark and Bug, which is just the most unlucky setting ever in the Alolan entries. Because if you remember well, those games are the ones that took upon themselves to single-handedly rehabilitate those three often forgotten Types. We have a Ghost Trial and a Dark Trial, and then we have to fight Ghost Captain Acerola two more times — one of them being an Elite Four fight, thank you very much. And then we have bloody Guzma and his bloody team of bloody Insect 'Mons, fronted by a bloody powerful Golisopod that somehow always managed to strike faster than my Raichu. And oh, did I mention that we have to fight him three bloody times? I suffered a lot through that run, let me tell you that. To add insult to injury, Alolan Raichu's double typing doesn't even bring anything worthy to the table solo run-wise: he can only learn two offensive Psychic Moves, which is definitely not enough of a pay-off considering all the hassle caused by his Psychic Type. A truly indecent amount of Battle Items were gobbled during that run and dirty strategies were used, let me tell you that.Although that Alolan Raichu run was definitely not the blast I had hoped for, it didn't make me swear off the series' mascot entirely. In fact, I consider that I have unfinished business with Pikachu: technically speaking, I still have to run solo with regular Raichu in a different game, which could change the course of things entirely. Given Pikachu's distribution, that different game would have to be X&Y or Red&Blue; and knowing those games' forgiving difficulty levels, I allow myself to think that the resulting Raichu solo run would be much smoother indeed. And of course, I still have to play Yellow and see if Starter Pikachu can reach the Elite Four on his own. As for my Alolan Raichu run, as much of a trudge as it was, it was redeemed nearly entirely by Alolan Raichu's unbearable cuteness. Gosh, hearing his cute little peeps and seeing his adorable happy expressions in Pokemon Refresh totally made me melt every time. Outstanding solo run material he is not; but when it comes to cuteness, he sure as heck lounges in the top tier. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},

Many a Pokefan is yearning for a Pokemon-related announcement at the upcoming E3, or a soon-to-come Pokemon Direct that would unveil the much-expected first Switch Pokemon instalment; and while such high hopes seem to be mostly wishful thinking, there are a couple of interesting rumours floating around.The first one, and probably the most reliable yet vague of the bunch, was ignited by Junichi Masuda encouraging Pokefans to get their paws on a Switch at a recent Pokemon fan event. This seems to be confirmation, straight from the horse's mouth, that the series is indeed coming to the Switch. However, it's just that: confirmation that a Pokemon entry will be released on the Switch at some point, and that the series is indeed making the jump to Nintendo's newest piece of kit. And while it's nice to see Masuda confirm that Pokemon is indeed headed to the Switch, it's not really a groundbreaking piece of information. At that point, with the Switch being a viable handheld and a successful console, it would actually have been more surprising to see Masuda imply that the series was going to continue on the 3DS. Having said that, one cannot help but wonder why Masuda coyly dropped that comment in front of a horde of Pokefans. Is there really a Pokemon entry coming out in the next months, or is GameFreak trying to single-handedly increase the Switch install base so that the next Pokemon core game will fly off shelves as soon as it's released? Or is it just, indeed, a playful confirmation that Generation 8 will make its debut on the Switch? Well, I guess only time will tell.Then we have Nintendo insider Emily Rogers \"believing\" that a Pokemon game will come to the Switch in 2018, and that this game will be an RPG and boast two versions. She also later stated that she didn't specify whether said RPG would be \"a core game, a spinoff series, a remake of an older game or a Gen 8 game.\" In other words, this new pair of Pokemon games could be any of the aforementioned things. My guess is that if those games indeed exist and are in the pipeline, they will either be entries in a spin-off series or Gen 4 remakes. The spin-off series in question is most likely to be Pokemon Rangers or Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, if we assume that Roguelikes can be widely classified as RPG. The first two instalments of the latter came out in two versions, so there's definitely a precedent here. As for remakes of Diamond and Pearl, they've been hyped and demanded for such a long time that I can very well imagine GameFreak tackling them to try their hand at developing for the Switch, while at the same time giving fans what they want and not risking messing up and blotching a core game. Three birds with one stone! Of course, that mysterious new pair of games could also be brand-new spin-offs. Or it could also simply not exist, just like the western version of Mother 3 teased by the same Emily Rogers. Once again, only time will tell.Then we have the most egregious rumour of them all, namely the Italian tranlastor 'leak' on 4Chan: a de facto announcement that a Pokemon core game is indeed coming to the Switch very soon, replete with story elements, new mechanics and artwork. Now this is nothing but a complete hoax, methinks. Making a living in the translation business is quite hard, and I cannot believe for a second that a translator who scored a gig with Nintendo would ruin their chances of ever working for them again, as well as their reputation in the translation business, by dumping crucial information about such an important game while simultaneously making themselves so easy to track down and identify. And talking about leaks and 4Chan, we also have the Starter 'leak', which features very cute and convincing Starter designs, but definitely wouldn't be the first occurrence of fake Starters gracing the internet. Then again, there were also genuine Starter leaks in the past years, so... Yeah. Once again, only time will tell if there's any semblance of truth in those flashy Gen 8 leaks.Let's now move on to a favourite subject of mine, dear fellow gamers: Pokemon solo runs! A whole new avenue suddenly opened on that front, as I managed to successfully trade 'Mons between my copies of Ultra Moon and Ultra Sun. Combined to Ditto-based Breeding, this means that I can technically run solo with any Alolan 'Mon that can breed, including late-gamers that were not an option until then. On the other hand, things are not so straightforward, because the obedience issue must be factored in in solo runs starring traded 'Mons. I would have to monitor my lone ranger's levels carefully, which could be all at once a challenge and a hindrance: what if I hit a typing roadblock that requires leveling-up just as I'm about to reach the current obedience cap? Would Battle Items be enough to take care of matters, or would I have to risk desobedience for the sake of added power and pray Arceus that my 'Mon heed my orders in battle? Mind you, this wouldn't matter so much if S&M and US&M weren't the hardest entries in the series when it comes to all things battling; but being the tough nut to crack they are, I genuinely fear being completely stuck mid-run with a traded 'Mon. Well, I guess I won't know until I try the deed, now will I? Bring on that Ninetales Solo Run I've been fantasizing about for years! And with that said, dear fellow gamers, my Pokemon thoughts of the moment end here. As usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Redux", "date": "12/05/2018", "text": "I restarted XC2 a couple of days ago, and I've already poured 40 hours into that new playthrough. Addictive game is addictive! As I expected (and hoped), that second run is infinitely more pleasant and engrossing than the first: I get a real kick out of knowing exactly what to do and being able to anticipate roadblocks and successfully circumvent them. Without further ado, here's a quick rundown of the activities I decided to focus on during that second playthrough.Common Blade Grinding: Things are working pretty neatly on that front. I rotate my Commons in Merc Missions and have teams dispatched at all times; as a result, I've been able to rack up a number of Field Skills that I could only dream off during my first playthrough. Which leads us to...Using Field Skills: I've been able to access a variety of places locked behind Field Skills this time around. The pay-off is not always stellar, mind you: most of the time, I'm only granted a safe or an item for my efforts. The pay-off doesn't matter, though, because the thrill lies in the act of exploring the world and uncovering secrets. Which leads us to...Exploration: I want to leave no stone unturned this time: no matter how long it takes, I'll explore Alrest's every nook and cranny. Nothing compares to the thrill of discovering a hidden tunnel or being able to reach a cliff that seemed inaccessible at first — and let's not even talk about all those \"Secret Viewpoints\". I have a soft spot for Mor Ardain, which literally bristles with hidden areas and tantalizing places that challenge you to reach them.Side Quests: Since I've been harnessing Field Skills, I can tackle side quests much more easily this time around. I've also been careful not to dive into questing too fast: first I explore, progress the story and level up a bit, and then I come back to formely explored areas to take care of quests. That tactic works like a charm, and I have a good number of cleared side quests under my belt as I'm writing this.Area Development: I managed to make some good progress on the development front, mostly through trial-and-error. (Want to develop Gormott? Just shell out 500,000 golds for the Inherited Core Crystal at Margia's Odds&Ends in Torigoth!) Overall, area development seems to be tied to a mix of investing money — heaps of it — into local shops and clearing side quests, with a couple of extra arcane requirements thrown into the mix. I'm determined to Develop on my own and not resort to FAQs, because it's more entertaining and rewarding that way.Affinity Chart Grinding: I was reluctant to grind Blade Skills during my first run, mostly because it screamed 'micromanagement' to me and I was already quite overwhelmed by the game's many features. However, raising Blade Affinity is actually quite fun and really not that demanding once you get the hang of it. I just use Merc Missions to grind all the Blades that can be dispatched, which leaves me ample amounts of time to pore over Pyra's, Dromarch's and Poppi's charts. And talking about Poppi, I was really determined to customize her this time around, but... I can't even beat the first stage of Tiger Tiger on easy mode! Why does that game need to be so hard? It's just an optional mini-game to obtain extra parts for a Blade that doesn't even really need them in the first place, darn it! Oh, well; screw Tiger Tiger, my Poppi is doing just fine as she is.Miscellaneous: Remember when I said I would rewatch all cutscenes with the english dub? Yeah, about that... I found out that I just cannot bring myself to sit through them again. So I'll just resume where I left off, i.e. at the end of chapter 7. On the graphical front, I cranked up the brightness to the max in a flash of anger, as I was yet again stuck in an infuriatingly dark building; and not only could I suddenly see much better, but I also really liked the result. It gives the game a subtle cell-shaded look reminiscent of Breath of the Wild; and as a gamer who laps up stylized aesthetics in games, I can only approve of that new look.  In a nutshell, that second playthrough is infinitely more enjoyable than the first, which confirms that this game does have indeed a lot of replay value. I was in a bit of a rush during my first playthrough, but I finally understood that XC2 is meant to be an epopee à la Dragon Quest IX, in which you take all the necessary time to build up your character and fully explore the world. That's exactly what I'm doing now, and I'm deeply enjoying the ride; and with that said, dear fellow gamers, I'll see you soon for more XC2 tidings. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's Delight: (Giddily) presenting the New 2DS XL", "date": "08/05/2018", "text": "I finally took the plunge and got hold of a New 2DS XL, a system I've been coveting for months on end but was reluctant to buy because of the ridiculously high number of 3DS I already own. But holy cow, was that a most inspired purchase indeed! In fact, I had such a massive crush on the system that I felt compelled to write a post about it without delay. Feast your eyes on the gorgeous Pokeball Edition of the 3DS' last iteration!Let's face it, Nintendo released way too many 3DS models over the course of the system's lifetime. The way they kept churning out new iterations with increasingly confusing names, each one arguably better than the one that preceeded it yet bound to be topped by the next one in line, was both silly and maddening. They released no less than SIX bloody 3DS models over the last six years; factor in the region lock, and you get a true collector's nightmare. I own way too many 3DS for my taste, and half of them have been made redundant by their younger siblings. And yet, I'm ready to forgive Ninty for all their 3Ds meanderings; because oh dear, did they top themselves indeed with the New 2DS XL. Not only is this by far the sleekest and most gorgeous 3DS model, but it's also one of the best handhelds they ever created — period.That piece of kit may lack 3D, but make no mistake: it vastly improves on both the regular New 3DS and the New 3DS XL on nearly all counts. Here's a quick round-up:Screen: Oh boy, is that thing gorgeous. It's miraculously mammoth compared to the system's overall size, and it boasts strikingly vibrant and vivid colours that really pop out. Coming from the regular New 3DS, I definitely saw the difference — and mind you, the regular New 3DS already improved a lot upon the original 3DS in that department. The screen's black borders make immersion into games easier, and give the console's upper part a neat smartphone look to boot. The touch screen is also huge, just as large as the New 3DS XL's one.Weight: The New 2DS XL is mercifully light. I weighed mine; and at 265 g, it's a puny 10 g heavier than my regular New 3DS, and an enormous 240 g lighter than my New 3DS XL. My wrists are definitely going to love that console, oh yes precious.Looks: This is arguably one of the fanciest 3DS models, if not the fanciest. The elongated shape gives that ultimate iteration a really sleek and classic look. All four editions boast a pleasantly sober dual colour scheme, in striking contrast with the regular New 3DS' rainbow buttons and many faceplates.Price: Although I'm not one to nitpick about prices when it comes to all things gaming, I'm also not one to sniff at a good deal. Being the cheapest New 3DS model out there, the New 2DS XL is definitely the piece of kit to go for if you don't care about the 3D. Considering that it comes with an adapter, unlike its two predecessors, this is definitely a bargain. New 2DS XL vs regular New 3DS. Of course, the New 2DS XL isn't perfect — no console is, after all. The stylus is a bit too small, the sound quality is lacklustre, and the mate finish looks a teeny-tiny bit cheap and gathers finger grease a bit too enthusiastically; but overall, we're still dealing with a darn good piece of kit. Nintendo managed to wrap up the 3DS line in a most glorious way with the New 2DS XL. It sure took them a long time to reach that level of perfection, and there was an awful lot of meandering along the way; but better late than never, right? In a nutshell: the New 2DS XL is awesome, I'm gonna get my paws on more of them — and I warmly encourage you to do that too. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Ultra Moon: The Primarina Solo Run", "date": "04/05/2018", "text": "After the XC2 mishap, I felt like I needed a lighter game to unwind and get back on track; and that's how I found myself picking up UltraMoon, which had been sitting in my collection for a couple of weeks. I unfortunately got the pair too late to get my greedy paws on the exclusive Dawn Rockruff, so I had to make do with the next best thing: Popplio, a.k.a. the last Alolan Starter I had to run solo with. I was lucky enough to snatch a female Popplio (can't help but think that Popplio's looks would have called for an exceptional reversal of the usual female/male Starter ratio); but woe is me, that female Popplio boasted a Sassy Nature — again!!! However, I was not in the mood to indulge in more RNG galore, and I decided to grind and bear it and run with the Popplio fate had granted me, hoping that overleveling would take care of matters on the long run.As it turned out, there was definitely no need to worry about Popplio&evos' performance. The Alolan sea lion is simply one of the best Water Starters I've ever handled — on par with my beloved Piplup — and he's the most efficient and kick-ass of the Alolan Starters by a very long shot. Popplio's Move pool definitely makes the most of his sky-high Sp.Attack: nearly all the offensive Moves he can learn are Special Moves, and ridiculously powerful ones at that; that makes him a pure special attacker, and a ridiculously good one at that. My Move quartet was pretty much set during the game's second half, with Moonblast (Fairy), Ice Beam (Ice), Energy Ball (Grass — a Water 'Mon wielding a Grass Move, how broken is that??) and signature Move Sparkling Aria (Water): all insanely destructive Special Moves with a power in the 90s and beyond. Popplio's Move pool is also nicely diverse, with Moves that can take care of a wide variety of 'Mons; in fact, Ice and Fairy Moves alone can wipe out most of the Alolan fauna. Also, I've never encountered a 'Mon with so many Moves that can target several opponents. I swear that at one point in the game, all of my four Moves were multi-targeting Moves — quite handy in Trials, indeed.Talking about Trials, the order in which they unfold is definitely in favour of Popplio, with little to no Typing roadblocks along the way. Not that it would change anything, mind you: the Popplio line, and more specifically final form Primarina, is so ludicrously overpowered that running solo with them entirely annihilates Ultra Sun&Moon's famed ramped-up difficulty and makes the games feel as plain sailing as X&Y. I can count on literally half the fingers of one hand the number of times I've used a stat-boosting item over the course of my entire run, none of these times including an Elite Four battle — as a matter of fact, I pretty much one-shot my way through the Elite Four. Long story short, Popplio is one of the most broken Starters I've ever had the pleasure of cruising with, and you should definitely choose him if you want an easy ride.I was initially planning to tackle a single Alolan solo run; however, US&M's revamped 'Mon distribution made me change my mind faster than you can say \"Gee, that 'Mon is super-duper cute and I've never run solo with it!\" As a result, I have a couple more US&M solo runs lined up, and I'm going to tackle at least one or two of them in the upcoming days. Stay tuned for more Pokemon goodness, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Houston, we have a problem", "date": "25/04/2018", "text": "And a mighty big one at that. See, I was fumbling with my Switch yesterday, trying to erase my Project Octopath Traveler demo save data, and... Heck, I sure you guess what happened, dear fellow gamers: clumsy little me selected the wrong save data, and that's how I ended up accidentally wiping my XC2 save data off the face of the earth.I should be absolutely crestfallen, even furious; but weirdly enough, I'm not. I daresay that I actually feel a bit relieved by that turn of events. The Spirit Crucible Elpys dungeon at the end of Chapter 7 was a bit of a turning point for me, because it forced me to a) switch to Morag as my MC because I couldn't stand the way Roc's wings blocked my view when handling Rex, and b) bond and assign Blades to stack up enough elemental ability levels to progress. As I did that, a whole new world of gameplay opportunities opened in front of my very eyes, and I suddenly realized how much I had missed in the preceeding 60 hours by refusing to experiment with Blades: exclusive elemental combos, passive buffs, restricted areas only accessible with Blade abilities, you name them. It was a bit of a bittersweet moment, and I couldn't help but wish I had pored over the whole Blade system and made it mine long before the game actually forced me to do so. Of course, it's entirely XC2's fault for letting me run free for so long before suddenly coercing me into Ability harnessing and Blade bonding, but still... That whole affair severed the fast-paced flow I had managed to create pretty much since the beginning of my playthrough, and generated mixed feelings I certainly didn't need.I was also growing tired of the story, which in my opinion took a turn for the worse in Chapter 7. (SPOILERS!) I joked in my last post about how Pyra \"Tits are life\" and Mythra \"Ass is hometown\" were really two facets of the same steamy coin; well, lo and behold, the game did it again with Nia! While regular Nia is your token cat girl in a body suit, Blade Nia is your no less token bunny girl in a leotard. Honestly, that design choice soiled her character ever-so-slightly for me. I also really don't like where the story is headed when it comes to Blades and their relation to humans, and I have that horrible inkling that the game is going to reuse concepts and story elements from Xenoblade Chronicles — which would be the most dreadful outcome ever as far as I'm concerned, because I found that game's story cheesy and clichéd beyond belief. I sincerely hope that the Architect will not turn out to be one of XC's main characters; and yet, I know I have to steel myself for such an outcome, because this is technically a sequel we're dealing with. (End of SPOILERS.)So what's in store for XC2, you may ask? Well, I don't know yet. I need a couple of days to digest that brutal interruption; but technically, I still crave some XC2 action. In fact, I'm really eager to replay the game's early stages with all my accumulated mastery of its many systems, and get a blast out of knowing exactly what to do and doing it swiftly. Also, I switched to the British dub at the beginning of Chapter 7 (I had rolled with the Japanese dub until then) and found myself really loving it, so I'd like to watch again all the cutscenes in english. And talking about cutscenes, maybe I'd like to skip them and watch them later, when I feel like taking a break from the game's grindy action. Oh, and I'd also like to handle Morag more, because a) she's an awesome fighter and b) she looks amazing, and I'd rather stare at her poised and noble figure than at Rex's ass crack and speedos. In short, there are plenty of things I'd like to do differently. This wouldn't be the first time I restart a long and rather complex RPG right after an aborted playthrough, mind you. I did that with DQIX and Fire Emblem Fates; and from my experience, it's a great way to maintain my drive to play (the last boss is still standing, dammit!) while allowing for a much cushier and smoother ride thanks to the game's mechanics being still so fresh in my mind. At any rate, I'll mull over this and see you later with more XC2 tidings, dear fellow gamers. In case you were eagerly waiting for my progress reports and final impressions about the game, I apologize profusely for my clumsiness; and as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Of demos and hauls that never were", "date": "22/04/2018", "text": "I just took a break from the Xenoblade Chronicles 2 grinding by playing the Project Octopath Traveler demo, which delighted and annoyed me in equal parts. I love the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the mix of 3D elements and pixel art and the many playable characters à la Seiken Densetsu 3; on the other hand, I hate how dark and blurry the graphics are, and I despise the lack of instant save. Come on Squeenix, which year do you think it is? Save points are simply unacceptable in 2018, even for nostalgia's sake. Having said that, I'm probably going to buy the game anyway, if only because it oozes some genuine retro charm. Games that try to capitalize on nostalgia by boasting pixel art and old-school gameplay mechanics are a dime a dozen these days, but most of them don't feel like genuine 16-bit offerings; POT, on the other hand, does feel like it's been lifted straight from the '90s. After the (huge) disappointment of seeing the Western 3DS release of DQXI cancelled, I'm expecting a lot from Squeenix on this one, and I sure hope they will fix the demo's issues as promised.Still on the demo front, I gave another chance to the World of Final Fantasy demo and found myself really liking it, to my utter surprise. I lapped up the game's grindiness and straightforward fighting system, and all the issues that bothered me during my first try went unnoticed this time around. Weird, really. At any rate, this means one more entry on my To-Get-My-Paws-On List, and one more opportunity for Squeenix to redeem itself in my jaded eyes.But enough of Squeenix for now, dear fellow gamers. It so happened that I took a small European holiday, which led me to cross paths with a brick and mortar game store. That store boasted a crap ton of Switch games, amongst which several offerings coveted by yours truly — Lost Sphear, Disgaea 5 Complete, Nights of Azure 2, The Longest 5 Minutes, Atelier Lydie and Suelle, you name them. I was about to go for a shopping rampage and snatch all of them; but then the price tags stopped me dead in my tracks. Those darn games boasted prices ranging between 50 and 65 euros, and that just obliterated my purchasing drive on the spot. Brand-new Vita and 3DS games cost between 30 and 40 euros, and I had no problems purchasing five or six at once; but I find much harder to indulge in such purchasing sprees with Switch games that are nearly twice as expensive. This may lead me to ponder my future Switch acquisitions much more carefully, and to invest in Switch games only if I'm 100% sure I'll like them. That would sure be a massive change from the not-so-distant time when I used to purchase any game that looked even remotely like an RPG.But what about 3DS and Vita games, you may ask? Well, I already owned all the 3DS games available in that store; as for Vita games, there were simply none. The Vita display was gone: no more games, no more accessories, as though the console never existed. This was eerie, let me tell you that. The Vita was always a niche console, and we all know it's headed towards retirement: but the complete and total absence of any Vita-related product in a game store really drove the point home.With that, dear fellow gamers, I'm going back to my Switch and to XC2 — which is still my one and only Switch game, grumble grumble. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2: 50 hours", "date": "19/04/2018", "text": "My Switch's battery is currently charging, after yet another long XC2 session that nearly totally depleted it; and as I just passed the 50-hour mark in the game, now's the perfect time to take a break and write a progress report.I'm currently exploring the snowy depths of Tantal, with my crew boasting levels in the mid-50s. I was already kinda overleveled at the 30-hour mark, and I got even more severely overleveled after I spent a couple of hours killing everything that moved in Leftheria. Then I spent another couple of hours unwinding in Temperentia, which made me even more ridiculously overleveled. As a result, I'm now towering a good 20 levels over tantalian foes and fighting for peanuts, with battles yielding little more than 50-70 XP. If I'm lucky enough and take down a huge beast, I might get 120-150 XP; not really worth the hassle, methinks. On top of that, none of the regular foes attack me anymore because of my high levels; as a result, I cannot help but feel like a nasty bully when I let my crew gang up on some poor unsuspecting beast that was not minding me in the slightest. I think I'm going to blitz through the game until I encounter juicier enemies that deliver more XP and have a bit more bite.As much as it pains me to admit it, I've virtually given up on side quests during the last 20 hours. I've reached a point where I can barely clear one side quest out of five, just because I lack the Blade abilities that would allow me to progress in most quests. I still accept them and fulfill them when I can, which does happen sometimes: while in Temperentia, I got a nicely relaxing fetch quest that allowed me to put to good use all the items I had foraged during my exhausive exploration of the place. But unfortunately, simple and straightforward quests like that are the exception rather than the rule. I won't criticize XC2's side quests for being long, complex and demanding, because that's very much a design choice that's just as valid as simple and short side quests; I'll just say that since I usually tackle side quests in RPGs to unwind and get a break from the main story, XC2's convoluted side quests are not exactly my cup of tea.I've dabbled a bit in Salvaging, mostly to unlock one of Poppi's abilities; and now that I'm done with that, I won't touch Salvaging again unless it's absolutely necessary. I've realized that I can perfectly live without the items that come from Salvaging, and even more without the QTE that come with it. As a matter of fact, I've realized that I can perfectly live without 95% of the items offered by that game; and as a result, I've decluttered my inventory and gotten rid of massive amounts of stuff that I'm pretty sure I would never have used anyway. That gave me plenty o' money to invest in Pouch items, which are a neat way to get passive buffs without having to lift a finger in battle. All in all, the only items I keep track of are Pouch Items, Core Chips and Accessories; the rest, I ignore or check once in a blue moon. Hey, maybe it's time to pore over my selection of Aux Cores again, just in case I got something juicy in the last 15 hours.It's smooth sailing on the story front. (SPOILERS!) The decaying state of humanity and the sheer desperation of the last remaining countries are becoming more blatant by the chapter. Alrest looked like a peaceful world at first, but the cracks are now plainly showing: some villages and towns are on the brink of starvation, whole Titans are becoming uninhabitable, and wars are about to be waged for tiny expanses of land. It's a dire reality, and one that the game presents with a lot of tact and restraint while still not occulting any of the issues at hand. But no matter how grim things are in Alrest, we still get privy to juicy romantic development between Rex and his two well-endowed Blades. There is definitely a love triangle at work there, as well as a funny dichotomy between the exposure of Pyra's and Mythra's assets, shall we say: while Pyra's outfit and the way the camera films her are all about exposing her bosom, Mythra's outfit and associated camera shots focus much more distinctly on her bottom and thigh gap. Will Rex be forced to choose between Team Butt and Team Tits, or can he get the best of two worlds? Only time will tell! Hopefully time will also tell if Nia is indeed a Blade as the game seems to imply, and what are Blades exactly. (End of SPOILERS)One development that took me by surprise are the technical issues. Ever since I set foot in Mor Ardain a couple of hours ago, things have gotten pretty hairy on that front, and a lot of hitches that were totally absent prior to that point started to appear and are now rampant. Clipping reigns supreme, graphics are getting fuzzier and grainier, textures pop in and out of existence and often take a couple of seconds to load after Instant Travel; and to my utter chagrin, the game's initially bright colours are becoming increasingly dull and washed-out, as though someone applied a crappy Instagram filter on my XC2. Gameplay is also affected to some extent, with hardcore slowdowns in hectic battles, the targeting feature routinely locking on some enemy roaming in the background instead of targeting the one that's right under my crew's noses, or foes slipping through the floor after a hit and delivering blows from there while I cannot retaliate. I don't know if these technical hiccups are to blame on Monolith Soft running out of budget or on my Switch being overwhelmed by my battery-draining gaming sessions, but I have to admit that these issues bother me ever-so-slightly. I'm not a graphical whore by any means, but seeing a game kind of unravel in front of my very eyes as I'm playing it is a rather unpleasant experience. I just hope things won't get significantly worse before the grand finale.That's it for that 50-hours progress report, dear fellow gamers! See you soon for the next chapter of my XC2 epic; and as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Details, details", "date": "14/04/2018", "text": "You know it's a fetish of mine to linger and agonize over details in video games, dear fellow gamers. Without further ado, here's the XC2 edition of my beloved \"Hell is in the details — and heaven too\" feature!\"Yes please\": —Instant save system AND instant travel! Oh, the extasy! I fully expected a long JRPG like XC2 to feature (too sparse) save points and to force some slow and unpractical travelling contraption on me, and I nearly cried with happiness when discovery the game's delicious player-friendliness.—Not status effects in battle. I don't think I've ever mentioned that before, but I hate status effects in battle in general, and I despise them twice as much in real-time fighting. There's nothing that breaks the flow of combat quite like having to fumble through one's inventory to snatch an antidote; and gosh, am I immensely glad to be spared that chore in XC2. —Being able to jump from considerable heights without dying is deliciously heady. Oh, sure, you can die if you really jump from too high; but overall, XC2 is much more forgiving in that department than, say, Tomb Raider or Breath of the Wild. I just love diving from a cliff into a lake 1000 feet below in Uraya, or taking a shortcut by jumping from the 3rd floor at the Argentum Guild. Cherry on the cake, you can find secret places and extra safes by taking such leaps of faith!—No equipement galore (insert eyes teary with happiness). Characters can equip two pieces of gear and Blades two Aux Cores, and that's it. I had read many complaints about the menus and customization systems being overblown prior to playing the game, and I feared some overkill in the equipment department; so imagine my surprise and relief when discovering those mere two slots. \"No thanks\": —The game is often too dark, especially in towns, caves, buildings and at night time overall. I find myself staring at my reflection in the Switch's screen while I'm playing way too often for my taste, and I sometimes cannot play at all unless I retreat in a dark room.—I hate how loot flies all around the place when I kill foes, forage or open safes, forcing me to gather items one by one afterwards. It's messy, sloppy and it makes me lose some precious time. It's especially annoying when fighting several foes in a row, because all that shit clutters the battlefield and I'm always wondering if some of the items will despawn if I take too long to wrap up the fight. I've also lost some (presumably) excellent loot because of that stupid feature, just because some items fell off a cliff or into deep water, or because a cutscene was triggered before I could pick up everything. Oh, and let's not forget all those times I fell to my death trying to gather loot next to a cliff.—Pyra is too unremarkable compared to other Blades. She's supposed to be that top-tier Blade, a league of her own; yet nearly all rare Blades look cooler, fancier and edgier than her. I have a hard time seeing her as an exceptional, mythical Blade when she's strutting around dressed like a dorky Europop singer. And no, her \"alternate outfit\" is no better. —I cannot fathom why Rex doesn't automatically draw his sword when being targeted by foes. I always take a couple of unnecessary hits because of that omission, not to mention that having to draw my sword in a hurry is so darn stressful that I often find myself fumbling with the buttons and taking even more damage.That's it for the hellish&heavenly details, dear fellow gamers; I'll see you soon with more XC2 goodness! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2: 30 hours ", "date": "10/04/2018", "text": "I was planning to write a progress report much sooner; but somehow, I found myself wanting to play just a little more instead, then a little more after that... And before I knew it, I had poured 30 hours into the game. On the other hand, 30 hours of XC2 probably amount to 5 hours in a regular RPG, so that's fine. Without further ado, here's the first of (I bet) many XC2 progress reports, dear fellow gamers! (SPOILERS!)So, where to start? The premise, maybe. I was not expecting to care about the story, like, at all; but to my utter surprise, I find myself actually sympathizing with Rex and understanding his plight and his subsequent eagerness to trust and follow Pyra. I mean, the kid probably did the math and realize that at the rate the Titans go down, he won't be around to see his grandchildren grow up; that's a terrible prospect for anybody, and an even worse one for a (presumably) virgin teenage boy who spend most of his life slaving away to feed his village. So when a ray of hope suddenly appears, can you really blame him for wanting to cling to it as if his life depended on it — which it might well literally do in that case? As for Pyra herself, I understand her even better now that I've played through chapter 3: she's basically in forced exile, an unwilling outcast who's been torn away from her homeland and wants to go back there at all costs. And talking about Pyra's home, the separation between the Titans and Elysium reminds me eerily of the whole Salem/Scrapyard situation in Gunnm (a.k.a. Battle Angel Alita). I have an inkling that if we do indeed reach Elysium, we're gonna discover that it's not as holy a land as we thought and that we were better off on the Titans after all. And since I'm mentioning the Titans, I cannot help but think that they were designed as a bunch of Noah's arks. I mean, they are floating on an endless ocean, with all those animals cohabiting peacefully on their backs... I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out later that they were indeed designed specifically to rescue the last remnants of a dying civilization.The characters, now. Well, I like them overall, and I have a special soft spot for Nia; in fact, I would definitely play as her if not for the fact that she's a healer and doesn't accommodate my bull-like fighting style. So far, I find myself disliking only two characters. One is Akhos, that arrogant, precious stuck-up little Harry Potter clone; and the other... Well, it pains me to admit it, but the other is Mythra herself. Gosh, I vomit her. Why, Monolith Soft? Why did you feel the need to squeeze that immature, touchy, violent tsundere b*tch into your game? Why not stick with Pyra, darn it? Pyra is calm, cool and collected, in a gentle and motherly way; and she was just perfect as the female lead. My party's chemistry was amazing until that broad Mythra popped up and ruined it all with her temper tantrums — like, blaming Rex for having \"awakened her\" while he was not even aware of her existence, calling him a pervert for oggling at her bosom for a nanosecond while she's the one prancing around half-naked, or slapping him hard for mentioning that she was blushing. The worse part is that so far, there is absolutely no sound justification for her existence, apart from fulfilling the tsundere quota and creating a lame love triangle between her, Pyra and Rex. The story implies that her changing into Pyra is a way to restrict her immense power, but that doesn't explain why she has to change her looks and behaviour in the process. Why did she feel the need to create a mellow alter ego for herself? Did her aggressivity cause a calamity of sorts in the past, or is she just ashamed of her violent personality? Well, she should.Now let's talk gameplay, folks! You know I like to keep things simple and streamlined when I play RPGs; and to my utter delight, XC2 is very much in the mood to accommodate me. I've been sticking to my initial Blades — Pyra/Mythra, Poppi α and Dromarch — in combat and doing just fine, and I fully intend to keep doing that as long as I can get away with it. So far, I've had no desire to start training with my other Blades; but you never know what might happen in the next hours. That's not to say that I didn't dabble in Blade bonding: I managed to snatch rare Blades Godfrey, Perun and Nim (the latter from a mere Common Crystal!) and they're currently busy slaving away on Merc Missions. I've not been touching Salvaging and Pouch Item management so far, but I fully intend to pore over it in the next hours, all the more so as I amassed a considerable amount of cash already and need some outlets for it. But no rush here, I still have dozens of hours of play ahead!As for my progression, I'm currently in Mor Ardain, trying to break into that shady factory. (That's chapter 4, although I routinely tend to forget that this game has chapters.) My whole crew is Level 37; and if the levels of the foes I'm currently facing are any indication, I'm a teeny-tiny bit overleveled. It's not like I actively grinded, though: I find myself fighting for fun on my way to places, just because I love combat in that game, and I cannot help but tackle every side quest that comes my way. And talking about side quests, they're very much a mixed bunch. They range from entertaining and forgiving to obnoxious and hardcore, and there's no way to know how they roll before accepting them. I finished roughly half of them so far, leaving the other half for later — or never. (I'm not losing sleep over uncleared side quests, I can assure you.) Overall, I've been progressing without a hitch so far, taking down bosses and unique monsters without breaking a sweat — which may or may not be due to the fact that I'm playing in Easy Mode. That's not too glorious of me, but I didn't want to run the risk of toiling on random encounters and being stuck on hardcore foes in a game that vast and that brimming with features and systems to manage.And that's it for my 30-hour progress report, dear fellow gamers. I'll see you soon with more XC2 goodness; and as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2: An unexpected crush", "date": "05/04/2018", "text": "This is the game I was telling you about, dear fellow gamers: my very own Switch killer app, the game I wanted to play so badly that no amount of reasoning could deter me from forking out an indecent amount of cash to get my paws on it and its hosting machine.I had my doubts about this, you know. Heck, I was totally afraid of just throwing my hard-earned money through the window with that move, that's what I was. I mean, the odds were totally stacked against me loving that game at all. For one thing, I hate long story-driven RPGs full of cutscenes as a rule, and open-world games tend to bore and exhaust me at once. For another, I deemed XC2's character design and outfits over-the-top and utterly ridiculous, and the fighting system looked like a hot mess. Last but not least, it so happens that I absolutely loathed the original Xenoblade Chronicles. I just couldn't fathom why my gaming instinct yearned for XC2; and although I finally complied and got my paws on a copy, I half-expected to have a miserable time with the game and give up on it very quickly. What happened instead is that not only have I been playing XC2 for a couple of hours without a hitch, but I'm also loving it more by the minute. Somehow, all the potential issues that bothered me before purchasing the game were tackled and magically solved:The cutscenes, pacing and story: The cutscenes are nowhere near as long and numerous as I feared, and they can be paused or skipped entirely. The pacing is certainly slow, but in a mellow, relaxed way: this is not your typical dreadful fake longevity-inducing slowness, but rather the tranquil slowness boasted by games that have a story to tell and an atmosphere to build up and take the time they need to do so. I've encountered that brand of slowness in games like DQIX and Trails in the Sky, and it's a pacing I relish very much indeed — probably because I love taking my sweet time to do things IRL. As for the story, it's as laid-back and unobstrusive as it gets: instead of coercing you into a given course of action, it gives you a general goal at any given time and leaves you free to aim for said goal at your own pace. You're free to go anywhere you want in the meantime and spend as much time doing whatever pleases you. For all intents and purposes, the story and gameplay are completely separate and independent from one another in XC2; and that's something that actually chagrined many a reviewer. As for me, I just love that arrangement, because it allows me to enjoy the better of two worlds at my own pace. The open world: The notion that XC2 was an open-world game was floating around before the game's release; and after playing it myself, I have to wonder if this was a marketing sham, a concept ditched during development or a misunderstanding of sorts. Because indeed, an open world Alrest is not. It's made of various enclosed and separate islands that only become accessible as you progress the story, and there's no physical in-game way to travel between those islands; instead, you have to use an instant travel system. Sure, the environments are gigantic and bound to give you a heady feeling of freedom; but when all is said and done, XC2's areas function just like traditional dungeons, with their dedicated fauna, decor and inflexible boundaries. The character design and outfits: Let's be blunt: before playing, I thought the whole crew looked dumb beyond belief. From Pyra's late '90s low-cut hot pants to Rex' spandex shorts, from the copious amounts of inner boob to the Saint Seiya-esque shoulder pads, everything screamed corny and lousy chara design. And yet, weirdly enough, all that corniness and lousiness virtually evaporated once I saw the characters in action. I honestly think Pyra and Rex look darn good in their outfits, and I wouldn't want them to wear anything else. That's not to say that I won't dress them otherwise if I get the opportunity; but if this happens, it will be for the sake of visual change and not because I cannot stand their outfits.The fighting system: To my utter relief, that whole fighting business was not nearly as messy as it looked on some Let's Play videos. Shutting down all voices during combat was a neat start; and once I got used to adjusting the camera when necessary and visually focusing on Rex while letting the rest of the crew do their thing, fighting became a deliciously smooth and streamlined affair and a continuous source of pleasure and joy. XC2's fighting system does away with mindless button-mashing and chooses instead to showcase and magnify the best elements of real-time combat, which are none other than the sharp timing, the clever positioning, the feverish rythm and the smooth flow of battle. It certainly doesn't hurt that the AI is quite stellar: my crew knows when to avoid blows and when to heal, and I can genuinely trust them and fully rely on them on the battlefield, which is the most wondrous feeling ever. In fact, I daresay that Rex has bitten the dust more often than Nia and Tora despite the fact that he's fully under my control. The filiation with XC: I didn't play XC enough to compare the two games; but suffice it to say that most of what bothered me in XC is nowhere to be found in XC2. Colours are brighter and prettier, the art style is more distinctive, the learning curve is more forgiving and, last but not least, the fighting system is much easier to grasp. While XC forces the player to scroll through a selection of Arts and select the one they want, XC2 has those same Arts displayed on the screen at all times and tied to specific buttons, and that makes all the difference in the world. As for the huge scales that disorientated me so much when I played XC, well... I somehow got used to them this time around. Maybe that's actually a matter of screen size, now that I think of it.My playthrough of XC2 is shaping up to be a very long one indeed, and I have tons of things to say about that game, even in these early stages. Expect a lot of posts about that Very First Switch Game of mine, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Switch, Switch, b*tch", "date": "30/03/2018", "text": "That's it, dear fellow gamers: I finally (and deliciously) succumbed to temptation and treated myself to a shiny brand-new Switch. I'm a complete handheld whore, yes I am.Yeah, I know; I didn't wait a couple of years as I claimed I would. But that's because of the games. The games, folks! It seems that the optimistic scenario I mentioned in my post about the future of portable gaming is becoming reality, to my utter delight and relief: developers that used to toil on the 3DS and Vita are moving to the Switch en masse, and the console is suddenly being flooded with all sorts of appetizing nichey, budgety, low-fi titles. With the game release schedule picking up the pace and at least a dozen coveted games in my To-Get-My-Paws-On List for 2018, I had absolutely no reason to wait any longer before securing a Switch—all the more so as my main other reason for waiting a couple of years, i.e. the hope of seeing a portable-only Switch grace the market, seems rather pointless now. Most Switch owners seem to love the switching gimmick and use it profusely; and unlike the 3D effect, the switching thing poses no threat to one's health, nor does it make one want to regurgitate their lunch when playing. There's thus no sound reason for Ninty to release a pared-down Switch to cater to worried parents and gamers who don't give a crap about the gimmick du jour. The only reason for such a move would be the budget aspect, and I'm not sure Nintendo would do away with the Switch's main attraction for the sake of shaving off a couple of bucks. In a nutshell: no more reasons to wait, gimme that gorgeous piece of kit! And if Ninty does release a portable-only Switch down the line, well... A collector like me always needs backup systems, oh yes precious. I'll let you on about a little secret, dear fellow gamers: there was actually one single Switch game that I really, really wanted to play. More like craved to play, actually. I tried hard to rein myself in, I waited a couple of weeks until the desire to play that game evaporated, I tried to focus on other games; but nothing worked, and my gaming instinct stubbornly refused to be swayed and remained hell-bent on playing that particular game and nothing else. Well, who am I to shun my ever-faithful gaming instinct? Heck, if I was so obsessed by that game, then surely it was a sign from the Universe that there was a mind-blowing gaming experience ahead, right? I've been playing said coveted game for a couple of hours now, and a blast is it indeedy. More on that very soon!First impressions—The Switch is much more comfortable to hold and play than I expected. I've felt no incomfort in my wrists and thumbs so far, even after long playing sessions.—The analog sticks gather dust really easily, and they're quite hard to clean. The obsessive-compulsive in me is definitely not pleased.  —It's incredibly easy to boot up the Switch in portable mode: I took it out of the box, plugged it and presto, I could play! To my utter delight, it's also possible to ignore the dock entirely and charge the tablet directly with the AC adapter, thus treating the Switch like a de facto portable system. Heck, I think I'm going to sell my dock and cables, because there's no way I'll ever use them. —Although that large screen is undoubtedly a thing of beauty, I must admit that neither its size nor its resolution wowed me. It's not me being blasé here, but rather the fact that when it comes to console screen size or videogame graphics, there's always a point of maximum enjoyment after which increases virtually cease to matter. For me, that point was the Vita's screen and overall brand of graphics; and any progress beyond that won't impress me much, I'm afraid. Like, I can feel a massive improvement when going from the GBA to the Vita, but I hardly feel any improvement going from the Vita to the Switch.—For some weird and unfathomable reason, the Switch doesn't feel like a true blue portable console to me. I don't know if it's because of its sheer size or because the controllers are not built into the system, but the Switch fail to generate that feeling of coziness and intimacy that I get with my other portable systems. On the other hand, I remember hating the Vita upon first play; so maybe it's just a matter of getting used to the console.So, do I love my Switch? Yes I do, and I don't regret my purchase one second. I'm glad I didn't buy the console one year ago and waited instead until my desire to get it became irrepressible. Now the games are pouring in, and my Switch is here to stay. Dedicated portable gaming is still alive and kicking indeed, and I'm insanely gladdened and relieved by this turn of events. We portable gamers get to press buttons and push analog sticks for one more console generation! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Stella Glow: I'm sated", "date": "24/03/2018", "text": "20 hours in, just cleared the 8th chapter, and... Now come the SPOILERS! Avert your eyes, lest Stella Glow's main event loses all its impact!Well, the game got me good with this one. I absolutely never expected Commander Klaus, i.e. the epitome of anime male perfection, to be a backstabbing traitor, let alone Alto/Elcrest's former-brother-in-arms-turned-jealous-rival. And yet, I guess I shouldn't be surprised at all in hindsight: although Alto was the titular Hero and Chosen One, Klaus was the de facto party leader, and the whole crew danced to the beat of his tune (pun totally intended). He lead us all on a leash like good little poochies, myself included, and I didn't realize it one second. I was totally and utterly fooled, and I loved being fooled. Well done, game.On top of being pleasantly surprising, that plot twist answers the question nobody asked themselves: what if your typical messianic RPG hero that newly awakened to their destiny unwittingly ended up serving the bad side's interests? When you think of it, it's quite improbable that these guys somehow always magically wind up on the good side, all the more so as they are usually meek-as-lamb amnesic village boys who never wielded a sword before learning that they were The One, let alone took part in any fight with major stakes. My, they're really just ripe for the grooming, aren't they? I have to commend Klaus for being an genuinely clever and devious RPG villain: instead of charging dumbly against The One and setting himself up for a resounding defeat, he manipulated everyone and used Alto's and the Witches' powers to serve his own nefarious purpose. In hindsight, Hilda and her cronies' spiteful attitude towards Alto&co and their refusal to explain what they were up to makes perfect sense: they were actually the good guys all along, and we were the big baddies as far as they were concerned — and as scores of RPGs taught us, big baddies deserve nothing but contempt and harsh words from the good guys. Way to take the piss out of the players by turning RPG conventions against them, game.As much as I dig that unexpected turn of events, there's a teeny-tiny problem: I really don't want to play Stella Glow any longer. See, everything until that point had led me to believe that the game was going to end there, at the end of the 8th chapter. I was fully poised for the grand finale: we were going to wipe the floor with Hilda&co, save the crystallized people, and restore world peace. Alto would be free to cavort with his own private little quatuor, the crew would live happily ever after, everybody would gorge on Klaus' delicious desserts until type 2 diabetes struck, The End. And now you're shoving that plot twist down my throat and telling me that the closure I expected is still some hours down the line, game? Oh heck no. I don't want to suffer through this, all the less so as I know exactly what's going to happen now. An inordinate amount of time will be spent laying down plan B, I'll have to run all around the world map to implement said plan B, Hilda will join my party and I'll have to Tune her several times, battles will get harder and I'll have to level-grind, yada yada. No thanks. In my opinion, the game should end right now — not only because that's what I was led to expect, but also because 20 hours feels like the right length for that game. According to internet wisdom, Stella Glow is roughly 40 hours long, and that's way too much, especially with a big baddie reveal at the 20-hour mark. How dare you pull a Tales of Hearts R on me, Imageepoch?Nope, baby. No more Tuning for now.And so I'm giving up on Stella Glow. I'm not swearing it off, mind you: I still see it as that delicious puff pastry of a game — but I'm sated now. Will I replay it at some point? Absolutely; I'll skip all them cutscenes, and I'll get my steamy endings with the Witches, my bro endings with the guys, and my harem True Ending with the whole crew at my feet. Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Chaos;Child: It's all over but the headache", "date": "19/03/2018", "text": "That picture suddenly makes sense.Here it is, dear fellow gamers: the last VN I snatched during the January PSN sale, and the last one to face the Shall We Get Physical Test. And my, what a handful Chaos;Child was. It left me elated, thrilled, shaken and nauseous at once. I want to replay it over and over; yet at the same time, I don't want to hear about it ever again. Let's try to sort out that milling mass of contradictory feelings, shall we? (Giant SPOILERS ahead!)The \"Gimme More\" side: The story and atmosphere are absolutely mesmerizing. This is hands down the best VN I've ever read, putting to shame Steins;Gate and even favourite otome VNs of mine such as Bad Apple Wars and Norn9. Not only did Chaos;Child regaled me with its mind-blowing story, its enthralling atmosphere and its charismatic characters, but it also treated me to a delicious millefeuille of plot twists, most of which I didn't anticipate at all. Now that's what I crave from a suspense story, be it a VN, a book or a film: developments that I don't see coming miles ahead and plot twists that make shivers run up and down my spine and leave me gaping. The \"I wanna puke\" side: The art is disgusting. The colour palette is ugly, characters look like sh*t (even though I got used to their faces after a while) and the overall character design makes no sense. The weird hair colours, improbable hairdos, oversized bosoms and slutty female uniforms scream \"harem anime\" and clash vigorously with the tense and creepy atmosphere and the story's serious tone. I cannot help but think that C;C's story would have called for a much more realistic and sober art style — but hey, maybe that's just me being an old fart who lost touch with anime tropes years ago. However, the art style is but a detail compared to C;C's biggest problem: that game is TOO DARN LONG. It claimed more hours of my life that any VN should have the right to claim, and that's without even playing the Heroine Routes and the True Ending. The last chapter alone is four bloody hours long, and the ten chapters that preceed it are not much shorter. Do you know how many books I could have read during all the time I spent toiling on C;C's main route, 5pb? Heck, that story could have been told so much faster. Like, stop writing down every single sigh, gasp or gulp uttered by the characters, stop describing every minute detail and every petty musing, and get on with it already.Cutest girl in the game. Too bad she's not real.Because that game has no respect for my time and has stolen enough hours of my life already, I decided to skip the alternative routes and call it a day. And after running to a story summary and spoiling myself rotten, I'm immensely glad I didn't toil through those routes. Not only do they pack disappointing developments, but I had actually foreseen most of said developments:Nono's Route: My guess was that Nono had taken Senri's place at the AH hospital and endured the experiments in her stead; and let's be honest, I would have preferred that outcome to the real thing. The idea that Nono is actually a transformed Senri is deeply unsettling, and somehow destroyed all the love I had accumulated for the character. Hinae's Route: It's all well and nice to get privy to Hinae's family history, but there's a small problem: those people were never mentioned at any point in the story before that, and I couldn't care less about their endeavours. Also, I would have been really salty if I had endured that route only to be slapped in the face with its nasty and depressing ending. Hana's Route: As I guessed, Hana was a Gigalomaniac too, and her powers were tied to her voice. The developments in her route are so ridiculously overblown, improbable and anime that I uttered a big sigh of relief at the though of what I escaped by skipping her route. Uki's Route: The classic 'Character thinks he's doing stuff while he's actually unconscious' setting. We've seen this a million times before, and I have no need for a nth retelling, especially one starring a transparent and servile character I never quite liked.I also spoiled myself regarding the True Ending while I was at it, and I was not disappointed this time around: the Chaos Child Syndrome is a really neat plot twist that I would have loved to uncover with my own eyes. I had an inkling that there was actually a collective delusion going on in Shibuya; but my version was a tad more drastic, as it involved Shibuya being still in ruins and having become a ghetto full of Psychics maundering around trapped in their shiny delusion of Shibuya being rebuilt and good as new. However, the game's version pleases me just as much, if not more than my own: the idea of the heroes being physically altered and totally unaware of it is fascinating, in a slightly gross and unnerving way, and it's the perfect ultimate plot twist to crown that amazing gem of a story.Having said that, I'm torn about what the writers did with Serika. On one hand, I totally dig the uncompromising and radical fact that she was basically born to be a slave and punching bag to Takuru's overinflated ego and fulfill all his desires, no matter how twisted they might be; but on the other hand, I regret that her mannerisms changed so much when her real nature was revealed. It would have been much more striking and disturbing to let her maintain her happy-go-lucky ditzy self — not to mention more darn logical. The way it was done looks more like your obligatory 'Chirpy character turns out to be a creepy plotting b*tch' trope, and I've long grown tired of that kind of contrived plot twist. Also, she's the only character that escaped completetly unscathed from that whole mess despite her involvement in the murders, and that outcome left a sour taste in my mouth. Was she actually the main character in disguise all along? On the other hand, it's only fair that she gets a modicum of happiness for herself after having been Takuru's DUFF for so long. Karmic reward, I guess. So, I loved Chaos;Child; but as it is, that game failed the Shall We Get Physical Test nonetheless. I cannot see myself playing through the whole thing again, let alone endure the alternative endings. I may change my mind on the long run, or I may decide that the 30 hours I spent playing C;C are enough for a lifetime. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Stella Glow: Warm and fluffy", "date": "15/03/2018", "text": "Those are strange terms to use when talking about a video game, but I just can't help it: Stella Glow makes me think of a warm and fluffy puff pastry. It's comforting, heartwarming and gladdening, just as any good puff pastry should be; and I'm filled with giddy delight every time I indulge in a bite. If there's any such thing as comfort games, then Stella Glow is exactly that.It's not just the fact that Stella Glow looks amazing, with its polished graphics, bright lovely colours and adorable character design; it's also the fact that it plays so smoothly and is so easy on the player. Heaven is in the details, as I always say; and stuff like the weapon dealer asking you if you want to sell your monster loot as soon as you set foot in her shop, or the game letting you know if a battle will occur or not in a subchapter, instantly won over my jaded gamer's heart. I also love how perfectly tailored to portable gaming that game is, with its short yet fulfilling subchapters and accommodating save options. I'm taking my sweet time and discovering the story at leisure, letting the game pamper me with its comfortable user-friendliness and delightful easiness. I only landed three Game Overs in battle since the beginning of my playthrough, and that was solely due to stupid mistakes on my part. (Except that time when Sakuya recklessly charged ahead and got herself killed, forcing me to dedicate a couple of units solely to protecting her fragile little arse.)For once, I'm glad that Stella Glow removed both the necessity and the opportunity to grind from me. I won't lie and claim that I totally ignore the few free battles I'm offered; however, I don't abuse them either, and I play them solely to let units that are a bit behind level-wise gain a welcome XP boost. Because indeed, SG quickly proceeds to giving you more characters than you can use in a single battle, and that's something that should normally piss me off; however, I don't mind at all in that particular game. All units sport their own strengths and weaknesses and have something to offer in battle, and it's fun to switch between them depending on the combat circumstances. I find myself actually strategizing instead of simply charging ahead blindly until there's nothing left alive on the battlefield. Sure, I'm still very much an SRPG noob; but considerations such as \"This is mountainous terrain, so let's use Ewan instead of Archibald\" or \"Let's first weaken that boss with my long-range units before finishing it off with my melee units\" are pleasantly new to me.To my surprise, I really dig the musical gimmick. Had someone told me that I would enjoy slaughtering foes to the beat of J-Pop, I would probably have laughed and dismissed the whole idea as ludicrous; and yet, I find myself really pumped up when I'm about to Conduct a Witch and unleash a wave of glorious J-Popness on the battlefield. And talking about Conducting, that whole business is decidedly brimming with erotic innuendos. I mean, you have Alto brandishing his thick little dagger and sticking it in the witch's body, after which said witch cries and moans in ecstasy... Heck, I think we all get the picture. And that whole Tuning thing, with Medea granting me access to 'the secret flower garden', asking me which girl I 'desire' and praising my 'amazing technique' — her own words, not mine... My, that's really all a giant metaphor for comfort sex, isn't it? Mind you, I'm not complaining; quite the opposite, that subtle brand of fan-service is actually very much my cup of tea. I'll take that kind of subdued eroticism over maid outfits, bath scenes and outrageous displays of T&A any day of the week.I've been playing for roughly 10 hours, and I surmise that I have to play for just as long before reaching the end of the story. I'm heading there at my own pace, one battle at a time; and I'm really enjoying the ride so far. I'll see you soon with more Stella Glow tidings, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collar x Malice: A bunch of douchey douches", "date": "10/03/2018", "text": "Let's not beat around the bush: CxM's beaus majorly suck. Some of them are slightly less douchey than others; but when all is said and done, they're all big douchey douches. However, I have to give them credit for straying from anime tropes and subverting expectations to some extent. What I cannot commend them for, on the other hand, are their improbable and ridiculously messy haircuts. I know we're dealing with a crisis quarantine situation there, but surely there must be some hairdressers left in Shinjuku. And what's with the improbable hair colours? Those five guys suffer from a serious case of bad hair day, and that certainly doesn't help their overall case as far as I'm concerned. (Hoshino herself is no better, mind you; it's like she couldn't decide between a bob and long hair and settled on a sloppy mix of both.) Having said that, on with the show! (SPOILERS ahead!)Shiraishi: The resident nutcase—with a feline twist. Although Shiraishi pleasantly strays from your usual otome psychopath by boasting strikingly good sun-kissed looks and a charming and playful personality, he's actually a really derivative character. Take Enomoto's chirpiness, mix it with Sasazuka's bluntness and brains, throw in a couple of cat-themed accessories for good measure, and voilà! That's Shiraishi for you. The poor guy's troubled past and his love story with Hoshino are just as unconvincing as his sense of style: I cannot believe for a second that a couple of hours spent with Hoshino over a two-week period are enough to overcome years of hardcore mental conditioning. Either Adonis' conditioning programs are utter crap, or Hoshino has some superhuman hypnosis abilities. The ending, on top of being depressing, is just ridiculously improbable. You want me to swallow that young and beautiful Hoshino is going to pull off a Penelope and wait patienly and lovingly for her terrorist boyfriend to be released from jail? Yeah, like heck she will. More like she'll find a nice normal guy to warm her up during those cold, lonely nights away from Shiraishi, and that'll be the end of it. All in all, Shiraishi's route is by far the most frustrating, implausible and unfullfilling of all the CxM routes.Enomoto: Right of the bat, I couldn't help but see the would-be samourai as a mix of Impey Barbicane from Code:Realize and Sha Gojyo from Saiyuki. Add to this his ridiculous eye patch, and you get a character that I couldn't take seriously for the life of me. Mind you, Enomoto's backstory was intense enough and could perfectly have redeemed his route and his character; but then he had to ruin it all by fretting every time Hoshino was kind to him, by fussing about indirect kisses and using first names, and by being generally way too impulsive and immature. And he's a crappy investigator to boot. Why am I even working with this guy, exactly? Not only does he do virtually nothing to help me, but I'm the one who has to drag him out of his procrastination misery and kick his butt so that he'll come to terms with his past. Yeah, sure! I have nothing more pressing to do after all, right? It's not like I have a collar choke-full of poison around my neck or something. In the end, Enomoto is not a bad character, but having to pamper and reassure him constantly just got on my nerves on the long run. Okazaki: Dreamy-eyed Okazaki is a really slippery character, a character I couldn't quite figure out despite spending hours on his route. His ulterior motive is too far-fetched to be convincing, and his sloppy looks and anarchic sleeping patterns just don't square with his steely determination and bewildering physical abilities. He's also overbearing and a bit of a stalker, and yet he peppers his SMS with cute smileys. I get the feeling that the writers just threw together a couple of conflicting features in the hope of obtaining a paradoxical and fascinating beau—and in my opinion, they kinda missed the mark. Okazaki is a very inconsistent character, and ends up being painfully forgettable. On the other hand, he's by far the gentler and most affectionate of the guys, and the sweet atmosphere he manages to create by sheer virtue of his mellow demeanour and adorable smiles redeems his route quite a fair bit. That's how I'm ultimately able to claim Okazaki's route as my second favourite route in CxM, despite the fact that I can hardly remember what transpired in it. Sasazuka: I thought I would be grappling with the resident tsundere here, but Otomate pleasantly subverted my expectations. Sasazuka is no tsundere indeed, but rather a very blunt and laconic character who doesn't mince his words and doesn't bother with subtleties such as politeness and putting himself in one's shoes. That tactless attitude is justified by the fact that Sasazuka spent years in the USA and was somehow contaminated by our famed barbaric Western rudeness. Hum, I wonder if the Otomate writers realize that Sasazuka is very brusque and brash even by Western standards? Oh well, nevermind. Sasazuka's bluntness and snarky comments aside, his route is actually my favourite in CxM. I dig the fact that he doesn't bother hiding his feelings, be they positive or negative; and I dig even more his boldness when it comes to carnal matters. Where the other guys hardly dare to brush against Hoshino and agonize endlessly over kissing her or not, Sasazuka just act upon his instincts. His relationship with Hoshino is pleasantly physical: he hugs her, kisses her and lays with her—and let's be honest, that's the last thing I expected from him given his ice queen demeanour in the prologue and the other routes. And since I'm a huge sucker for the 'Quiet Character That Turns Out To Be A Horny Pony' trope, I lapped the whole thing up. Oh, and the guy loves doughnuts—and anybody who loves doughnuts gets an instant pass as far as I'm concerned. Yanagi: Sheesh, what a giant snoozefest. I hoped that the game's poster boy and true route tenant would pack some punch behind his nondescript looks and low-key behaviour; but alas, Yanagi is every bit as boring in his own dedicated route as he is in the prologue and the other routes. There is not a shred of chemistry between him and Hoshino: they don't ever seem to feel comfortable in each other's presence, let alone attracted to each other. Then there is the massive issue of their common past: when Yanagi mentioned that he and Hoshino were \"perpetrator and victim\", I immediately pictured a situation in which Hoshino would have to choose either to get her revenge on Yanagi, thus subscribing to Adonis' ideals, or to forgive him and break the insane and potentially endless vicious circle of crime&revenge instigated by Adonis. That would have been the most intense and perfect outcome, wouldn't it? But NOPE! It turns out that Yanagi actually rescued Hoshino from a random abductor back in the days, after which the matter is prompty ousted and never referred to again. I seriously suspect that this event was shoehorned into Yanagi's route to create a connection of sorts between him and Hoshino. Like: \"Suuuure, there's no spark at all between those two—but hey, they met in the past!!! That has to count for something, right?\" Well, I'm afraid not. Yanagi's route could have been redeemed by the fact that it let me flex my investigative muscle at long last—but infortunately, that was too little, too late. And I'm still pissed off that the game required me to input a certain character's full name without giving me the opportunity to save or check my files first. I sure knew all the character's last names, but their first names? Are you kidding me, Otomate? I had to reload my last save to retrieve the first name in question, and I was none too pleased by that interruption.Nope, you can't have them.On top of offering nothing but douchey beaux, CxM keeps the best guys tantalizingly out of your woiing reach. You sadly cannot get into Minegishi's, Morioka's, Mochida's or Saeki's pants, which is a huge pity given that they all have nicely normal haircuts and behave ten times more decently than Yanagi&co. (Morioka in particular is a real sexy b*tch, and I'm sure many a CxM player would have killed for some steamy lovin' between him and Hoshino.) I'm not sure I'll ever bother getting up close and personal with the CxM crew again—but then again, only time will tell. And after that lukewarm experience with CxM, I'll take a nice, long break from otome games. I won't take a break from visual novels yet, though: I have one more VN from that January PSN sale to put to the test, and I'll do it without delay. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collar x Malice: Not feeling it", "date": "06/03/2018", "text": "Sheesh, is my otome tolerance running low already? Collar x Malice left me cold and utterly bored, which is certainly not a development I expected given the glowing reviews reaped by that game. So what's the problem exactly? Is it me, or is it the game? Why, of course it's the game! It sure cannot be me, because I was very much in the mood for more otome drama at the beginning of my playthrough. So, how did CxM manage to kill my otome buzz? I could draw up a neat list of the things that this game did wrong, but I won't do it because a) I already drew up lists in my recent posts about otome VNs and I'm getting sick of it, and b) I don't care enough about CxM to put that kind of effort into writing about it. See, that's how totally unimpressed I am by that game.So I'll keep things neat and brief for once and go straight to the heart of the matter. CxM is an excellent game in many ways: it boasts gorgeous art, splendid character design, a stellar soundtrack, an enrapturing atmosphere and a captivating story. It certainly deserves its stellar scores allright; and yet, I didn't like it, because it didn't give me anything. No sweet love stories that made me stupidly warm and mushy inside, no gripping mysteries to uncover through the power of my mighty investigative brain—niet, rien, nada. CxM is basically Amnesia:Memories with collars, guns and terrorists—and without the thrill.The two games sport a similar premise, i.e. an heroine thrown into a dangerous situation and forced to collaborate with a bunch of rude and wary beaus. Amusingly, both games also sport an uncanny number of branching bad endings in which the heroine gets killed by random people in gruesome ways; however, the similarities end here. Amnesia:Memories puts you in charge of your own destiny and makes you sweat to recover your memories and win the guys' love. Like a private eye on the prowl, you must pick up clues to figure out the nature of the heroine's missing memories and select the appropriate dialogue choices—all this while balancing your beau's feelings and worming your way into their heart. Ironically enough for a game whose main characters are actual cops and detectives, CxM totally fails to exhibit this kind of agency. As leading lady Hoshino, I'm completely passive and have no choice but to let the story unfold with hardly any input on my part. I'm the victim here, but my beau du jour is the one doing all the work and saving my arse. I'm not happy with that, not at all. Why don't I get to investigate, damnit? Am I the bloody main character or not? I'm the Collared One, and a cop to boot; and yet I cannot lift a finger without first obtaining permission from those guys I hardly know. It doesn't make sense story-wise, and it's darn frustrating gameplay-wise.To add insult to injury, Hoshino's predicament is not even the focal point of the story. The collar is little more than an inverted MacGuffin of sorts: it's the plot device that drives the characters together at the beginning of the game, after which it's promptly forgotten and hardly ever mentioned again. Instead, the story focuses on the hardships of Hoshino's beau du jour, who gets to take centre stage and shine as the route's true star while Hoshino has to play second fiddle. Now listen, game: I have a bloody collar full of bloody poison around my bloody neck here, and I don't give jack sh*t about the troubled past of some guy I just met. That whole story should be about Hoshino first and foremost, and then about her beau du jour. Look at Amnesia:Memories: they nailed it perfectly by centering the story around the heroine's memories, which happen to include the guys. Now that's the way to do it, writers. If you choose to put your leading lady in a sticky situation, make sure she's the centre of interest all the way through and not just a mere side dish.So, that's another otome VN that bites the dust and fails the Shall We Get Physical Test. That being said, I'm not writing off CxM completely yet. I may come to reassess it on the long run, just like I did with Code:Realize; or I may completely forget about it, just like I did with Steins;Gate. Only time will tell if that game wins a place of choice in my precious collection or joins the ranks of the Games That Failed To Impress Me. For now, CxM will occupy me just a little longer, as I want to write a full report about its resident unsavoury pricks. I did say that there were no sweet love stories to be found in that game, didn't I? Well, I sure won't let these guys off the hook so easily. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Children of Mana: My thumbs scream for mercy", "date": "01/03/2018", "text": "I'm reaching that point where I'm longing to replay the very first games I played after my Second Coming of Gaming. Children of Mana was one of them, and I have very fond memories of playing it, somewhere between Sonic Rush and Dragon Quest IX. So when my gaming instinct compelled me to play it again, I gladly caved in and went for another round of hectic hack'n'slashy, dungeon-crawly action — and with that sentence, the game is pretty much exhaustively described. Some critics back in the days blamed the game for straying too far from the Mana formula, but I beg to differ. Children of Mana harks back to the series' famed 16-bit era by being a pared-down retelling of Seiken Densetsu 3's grindy second half; and sure enough, CoM manages to replicate most of his venerable ancestor's pros and cons in the process.The 'Yay': Stellar fighting system: as far as retro-ish ARPGs go, you won't find much better than CoM. The physics are top-notch, and punching every living thing into oblivion soon becomes ridiculously addictive and a true guilty pleasure. Now, if you want to have a real blast playing that game, do yourself a favour and pick up Tamber as your character. It's all too easy to dismiss her as your usual frail range weapon user, when she's actually a true melee beast. She hits just as hard as Ferrik and is significantly faster than him, which means that she can wreak havoc on the battlefield while swiftly avoiding enemy fire. Trust me, I tried them both extensively and my seasoned fingers know the better character when they handle them. Mana charm by the truckload: The unmistakable graphical style of the series is there, as well as its most famous locales. Bright and shiny colours abound and the whole atmosphere is incredibly lovely and uplifting. Never had it been so heartwarming to destroy whole ecosystems by wreaking havoc on the local fauna.  Battle fairness: Foes are affected by traps on the battlefield just like your character. Now that's just a detail, but that's the kind of thing that separates good and fair games from nasty cheating ones as far as I'm concerned. It always royally pisses me off to see foes waltz around hazards that eat away my character's HP bar, and I appreciate CoM for trying to redress the balance.Great soundtrack: If you're any familiar with Mike Oldfield's work, many tracks sound a lot like his '70s output — Incantations and the like. Now, I have to admit that this soundtrack tends to grate on my ear very quickly for some reason; but there's no denying that it's incredibly lush, polished and complex. And I really, really love the first track, a.k.a. 'Tower of the Flickering Prayer'; it makes me want to roam dungeons on and on!Lots of lovely loot: Treasure chests! Monster drops! Stuff hidden in bushes! Forget about the village's shop and its greedy owner, all you need and more can be found in dungeons. Sell the extra items for good money, reinvest it in bigger bags and awesome gems and you're set. The 'Meh':Too. Bloody. Grindy: Hence this post's title. I never though I'd ever call a game \"too grindy\", but CoM is just too bloody demanding for its own good — and for my wrists. Most hardcore grindy dungeon crawlers favour turn-based combat over action-based combat, and there's a very sound reason for that: the latter is bound to inflict a nasty case of carpal tunnel syndrome on the unsuspecting player before long. It would have been nice to implement less foes, or to make them less persistent and/or resistant. The difficulty spikes at the beginning of each dungeon are also a royal pain in the butt, because they require level-grinding and CoM is really not a game that lends itself to grindy bouts. The MC levels up way too slow and each level require the slaughtering of dozens of foes; and if your mind doesn't balk at the task, then your thumbs will. Tedious sidequests: Sidequests could have been a welcome breather from all the crawly and grindy action; but instead, they involve crawling already explored dungeons over and over again while killing everything in sight. Also, they often feature an insultingly high number of floors and reuse the exact same floor layout ad nauseam. Eew. The second half is a total bore: Overblown dungeons, milling masses of insanely irritating enemies that take a million hits to die, a story that goes nowhere and a final boss that's a total pushover not worth the hassle. Nuff said. Since I polished off CoM back in the days and know exactly what to expect from it, I had no qualms about ditching it as soon as it became tedious, i.e. at the beginning of the Mana Ruins dungeon. Heck, I remember coming very close to ragequitting in the last dungeon back in the days, and I certainly don't want to go through that again. Still, I love that game despite its flaws, and you can bet I'll play it again sooner or later. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Coveted Games: All over the place", "date": "25/02/2018", "text": "What my brain looks like right now.  I'm a hot gaming mess these days. My collecting instinct came back with a vengeance some two weeks ago, prompting me to buy such a crap ton of games that I'm up to date again on my To Buy-List. As it is, I'm using all my willpower to curb my roaring purchasing drive and refrain myself from sweeping those seven Japanese Vita games that are currently lounging in my Amazon basket. Wait at least until an hypothetical localization announcement, dang it!Having said that, I'm fully aware that there will be fewer and fewer localization announcements for the Vita in 2018. Games that would have been released on the PS4 and the Vita a mere year ago are now being proudly advertised as coming to the PS4 and the Switch. It's getting harder and harder to resist the lure of Ninty's newest piece of kit, and the only reason I haven't caved in yet is because I'm waiting for the console's next iterations. A portable-only Switch, yes please!!! The games, on the other hand, are darn tempting; I'm probably going to get my paws on my Very First Switch Game very soon, and it's probably going to be a Japanese copy of Ikenie to Yuki no Setsuna, with its convenient english and french subtitles. Unless it's the North-American physical version of Fallen Legion, which I want to secure before it becomes prohibitively expensive. Or maybe Nights of Azure 2, which I've been wanting to play, like, forever. And what about the famed Dark Souls, a game that was beyond my reach until now and whose legendary difficulty piques my masochistic streak? I sure won't have any problem finding good Switch picks in the months to come, oh no precious.More of my greedy, gaming-obsessed brain. Not that I have problems finding good Vita and 3DS picks right now, mind you. Squeenix treated us to Romancing SaGa 2 at long last, Limited Run Games released a Vita RPG for the first time in weeks, and those high-profile 3DS titles I've been drooling over for months are slowly but surely starting to grace digital shelves. I'm a very happy little collector right now. Not only am I greedy for new additions to my precious collection, but I'm also yearning to play tons of games. I want to start them all, play them all, all at once! Those six games I received two days ago? Bring them on, says my gaming instinct! That's a most unusual state of affairs, but I cannot say I dislike it. It's just that there's no way this can work: if I start six games at once, I'm gonna be overwhelmed and drop them all before long. Better be reasonable and focus on the three games I'm playing right now, all the more so as I'm clearly neglecting two of them already. I'll see you soon with posts about these three games, dear fellow gamers; in the meantime, feel free to let me know what you're playing right now, as I'm also greedy for gaming tidings. Thanks for reading as always, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Etrian Odyssey: Drop it like it's hot", "date": "21/02/2018", "text": "After an indecent number of hours spent playing EO, I finally called it quits and erased my save file — and boy, am I insanely relieved. I love that game to pieces, but it was starting to make my gaming life a misery. I made it all the way to the bottom of the Sandy Barrens; and there, on the cursed 20th floor, I was confronted with my biggest challenge so far. I was given the mammoth task of defeating 14 FOEs and a boss in a row, all that without exiting the labyrinth — coz if I did, all the defeated FOEs would respawn. That was the mother of all insane challenges, and in any other circumstances, I would have been thrilled to bits and would have taken up the gauntlet with gusto; but this time, I just didn't feel like it. I have to admit that the level cap did do a number on my motivation, no matter how hard I tried to pump myself up; and so did the 4th stratum's dreary colour palette, the nagging backtracking, the annoyingly high encounter rate, the infuriating status effects and the cursed absence of an instant save feature. In the end, I just got drained, and those hateful 15 were the last straw that broke my crawling drive.This is not the first time I give up on a FPDC, mind you. My run of Class of Heroes also came to an abrupt end back in the days; however, my reasons for giving up were different. I ditched CoH because I was sick to death of its obnoxious dungeon design; on the other hand, I ditched EO because I was sick to death of its obnoxiousness, full stop. EO is like that new pal you meet and click instantly with, thinking you're gonna be mates forever — only to realize after a few weeks that they're a bit of a prick after all. EO is a game that's stupidly hard for the sheer sake of being stupidly hard; and when I say \"stupidly\", I mean it literally. The kind of difficulty boasted by EO is neither fulfilling nor genuinely challenging: stuff like the absence of an instant save feature, the low escape rate, the random action order in battle or the level 70 cap are just arbitrary limitations whose sole purpose is to make the player's life miserable and force them to pour more hours into the game.Now, does that mean that I'm swearing off that game and the series it belongs to? Absolutely not. On the contrary, I see this run as a necessary baptism of fire that allowed me to figure out the series' rules and to be better prepared for my next run. As a matter of fact, here are the things I'm already planning to do next time I play some Etrian Odyssey:I'll experiment with other classes before deciding which one to pick for my one and only. I went straight for Protector this time because of that class' high defense and healing skills; but maybe other classes could fit the bill just as well and offer more profitable combinations of abilities. I'll retire my lone ranger at least once to gain yummy stat increases. I didn't dare to do so in my run because the mere thought of grinding all the way back to my current level was more than I could bear; however, I neglected to factor in the gear element. Being decked in powerful gear when I retire means that I can grind on deeper floors and level up faster. Given how fast I reached the level cap, I can definitely afford to keep grinding longer.I'll ignore the sidequests and focus solely on roaming. I tackled a lot of sidequests in the early stages of my run and lost some precious time doing so — time that would have been better spent exploring. On top of that, the rewards granted by these quests are not really worth the time and hassle. I'll use more healing items in the exploration phases, i.e. when I map out floors. My playthrough has proved that the money balance in EO is not a problem at all when running solo, so I can afford to stock up on restoring stuff and indulge in longer roaming sessions. So, while me and EO are clearly done for the time being, this is absolutely not an adieu. I'm gonna play that game again, I'm gonna play its sequels, and I'm gonna keep purchasing every new game in the series and rejoice at the though of the many hours of crawling goodness that lie ahead. This is not the end, indeed; this is only the beginning between me and Etrian Odyssey! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Bad Apple Wars: From love to hate to love again", "date": "18/02/2018", "text": "Let's get straight to the point: I ADORE Bad Apple Wars, so much so that it can claim the honour of being my absolute favourite otome VN so far. (Yup, I love it even more than Norn9—although to be fair, there's but a teeny-tiny gap between the two games in my heart.) But as the title implies, it was not always that way. It took a lot of time and runs to reveal that game's true potential, and my feelings for it went through a lot of ups and downs in the process. Without further ado, here's the story of how BAW meekly but decidedly climbed to the top of my personal otome chart. (Minor spoilers!) Things started auspiciously, as I had an instant crush on BAW the very second I started playing it. I was hopelessly fond of the sharp character design, the distintive art style, the vivid colour palette, the lush soundtrack, the unique font, the lively translation, the zesty voice acting, the eerie setting, the mesmerizing atmosphere—the everything. I just loved that game, period. It oozed some strong Danganronpa vibes, and yet it was unique enough to not feel like a complete rip-off of said Danganronpa. I relished the fact that the heroine was this bland, unremarkable, nearly blasé character instead of your usual cheerful and upbeat otome MC, and I was delighted by her uncanny ability to maintain her apathetic edge even in the face of a completely foreign and ludicrous situation. I cleared Satoru's route first, and I enjoyed it so much that I was just that close to jumping on my keyboard and ordering a physical copy of the game. However, experience had taught me to be cautious with VNs and otomes, and to not judge a whole game on a single route. So I restrained my roaring purchasing impulses, and kept playing.And sure enough, things started to deteriorate right from the second route. I went for Higa, and I was quickly irritated by Rinka's submissive attitude towards the Bad Apples and by the goody-two-shoes and holier-than-thou attitude of said Bad Apples. I started suspecting that the writers had a mighty big bias towards the Bad Apples indeed, and that the choice between two sides I had somehow been promised was nothing but a marketing sham. Then I played Alma/Aruma's route, and the repetitions promptly drove me crazy. Higa's and Aruma's routes had so many scenes in common that I felt like I was virtually playing the exact same route, only with a different suitor. And to my utter dismay, the same pattern reared its ugly head yet again in Shikishima's route. That's when I resorted to skipping massive chunks of the game in order to reach the next exclusive scene without having to sift through mountains of already read dialogue; and by the time I polished off Watase's route, I had virtually stopped reading segments that didn't feature the beau du jour. That sure didn't help alleviate my negative feelings towards BAW, as all that skipping made me feel more disconnected from the game than ever. To add insult to injury, the story was not answering all my questions, and you know how much I hate it when a story leaves me hanging and doesn't bother tying loose ends. In a nutshell, I was pissed off, and my initial love for the game had turned into contempt and aversion.I thought things were well and truly over between me and BAW—but lo and behold, a few days after the end of my run, I started nursing second thoughts. I though that maybe I had missed some key information by skipping so many scenes; and I wondered if maybe the bad endings, which I had carefully avoided, could shed light on some unexplained story elements. Most importantly, the game still tugged at me and draw me in somehow; and deep down inside, I really didn't want to dislike it. And that's how I decided to give BAW a second chance and found myself replaying the whole game from scratch, bad endings included.And to my utter delight, everything clicked into place during that second playthrough. It turned out that BAW is one of these stories in which nearly every word uttered by the characters contains meaningful information and is relevant to the plot, and that I had indeed missed a lot of important narrative elements by force-skipping entire sections and avoiding bad endings. I finally managed to piece everything together and I was able at long last to understand the whole story—and holy cow, is it a mind-blowing story indeed. Very consistent rules, no major plotholes, no trace of ad hoc or deus ex machina and last but not least, a delightful plot twist—albeit a bit too muted for it own good. It took an awful lot of unraveling to get the full picture, but gosh, that was so worth it. The game's title finally made sense, as well as the fact that there's only one true side available: the sole purpose of the NEVAEH Academy is to coax dead youngsters into overcoming despair and recovering the will to live, and that deed can solely be achieved through being a Bad Apple. Fully understanding the story's stakes also gave me a new appreciation of all the characters, whose hurdles and hardships suddenly became much more touching and heart-wrenching. And that's how I found myself not just merely loving BAW again, but loving it ten times more than when I started playing it.It goes without saying that after all that, BAW brilliantly passed the Shall We Get Physical test. And it passed with honours too, since I ended up purchasing the regular North-American edition AND the Japanese special edition. As they say in french, when you love, you don't count the (shipping) costs! Having said that, I'm going to skip the route report for that game. The reason for that most unusual course of (in)action is twofold: first, the romance in BAW is clearly secondary to the overarching story, a mere side dish to be enjoyed along the way; and secondly, although I kinda liked all the guys and could relate to their plagues, I don't have much to add about them. I was thinking of laying down the rules of the BAW universe in a dedicated post, but I'm not sure I'll have the drive to do that. What I have the drive to do, on the other hand, is play the last otome VN I snatched during that January PSN sale. Let's get back to the love grinding! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},

While I adored Emerald Grove and despised Primitive Jungle, I have mixed feelings about Azure Rainforest. Things started auspiciously enough, with lenient trash mobs, softcore FOEs, easy to navigate layout and, last but not least, a great decor that made crawling deliciously pleasant and relaxing. XP was raining on me, especially when Treefrogs and their propensity to call for help were involved, and I already saw myself reaching the big 99 before I was done with the stratum. In a nutshell, I was enjoying myself tremendously and relishing the change of pace after the obnoxiousness of the second stratum.Best enemy evah. Then came the nastier blow I had endured since I started the game, a blow that was made all the nastier by the fact that I didn't expect it one second: the level 70 cap, folks. I reached that level as I was innocently cruising the 11th floor and realized, to my utter horror, that battles that ensued didn't yield any more XP. A frantic internet search revealed that for some unfathomable reason, party members in EO cannot go beyond level 70. Seriously, game? Why the heck do you violate the implicit RPG rule that states that characters can go up to level 99? Are you trying to be edgy or something? I'm not gonna lie: the discovery of that level cap was such a blow to my gaming morale that I seriously considered giving up on the game entirely. Not only did I see random encounters as pointless obstructions with no benefits whatsoever after hitting level 70, but I also genuinely feared being ovewhelmed further down the labyrinth. Having reached the maximum level at the beginning of the third stratum, was there any hope that I could go all the way down to the maingame boss? Sure, I was seriously oveleveled; but would that be enough? And if that wasn't enough, then why did the bloody game let me run solo only to stab me in the back?I was getting all fidgety and paranoid, and my drive to roam was slowly but surely evaporating; but them, I suddenly remembered something that gave me a glimmer of hope. The farming, folks! It's a well-known EO feature that monster drops can be used to forge gear — the stronger the enemy, the better the gear. I suddenly had a very good reason to forge ahead, as well as the implicit guarantee that I would indeed be technically able to forge ahead: I just needed to get my paws on good monster drops, and I'd have my progression covered.My drive to roam blossomed again after that, and I spent the next hours blazing through what proved to be the fastest and easiest stratum by far and the perfect breather after the tediousness of its predecessor. Oh, it sure had its share of hindrances and nasties: the 12th floor ants were a pain in the behind that generated many a Game Over, and I could have done without all those Killclaws that tried to sneak on me when I was engaged in random battles. But overall, it was a jolly good ride. As planned, I clawed and sliced myself some neat monster drops that granted me powerful pieces of gear that compensated for the levels I was no longer gaining. And here I am now, standing at the entrance of the freshly uncovered 4th Stratum and ready to keep crawling. I'll get to the bottom of that labyrinth or die trying, I swear. See you soon for a red-hot Sandy Barrens report, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Period Cube: Poyo-Poyo's route — The best for last", "date": "11/02/2018", "text": "Heck, I love Poyo-Poyo's route. It was the very last route I played, and it was so darn good that it somehow redeemed the whole game in my eyes. It roused me from the comfortable slumber the other routes had put me in, blew my mind and made my heart skip a few beats; and as far as I'm concerned, it's the only route worth its salt in Period Cube. Let's get on with the praise! (Spoilers ahead!)Why Poyo-Poyo's route is the greatest: — Of all the bachelors, Shiki is the one we get to know best — as a matter of fact, he's the only beau we get to know extentively before we can romance him, and that makes all the difference in the world. By the time his route becomes available, we've heard about him so much that we already formed an opinion about him and that he feels somehow familiar to us; yet at the same time, we can't help but be curious about what he's really like and what makes him tick. As a result, Kazuha's romance with him feels much more natural than her romances with the rest of the crew and flows much more effortlessly. Also, the whole story is kickstarted by Kazuha's strong desire to find Shiki; so it feels only fair that said story should end up with her getting her paws on him at long last — in all possible ways. He's bringing sexy back. — Shiki is a vibrant mix of tenderness, affection, passion and lust — and so is his route and his relationship with Kazuha. This is the only route that explores the full emotional spectrum of a romantic relationship: the combination of Poyo-Poyo's kindness, cuteness and good-natured banter and Shiki's intense love and repressed lust for Kazuha creates a potent and heart-wrenching mix that has way more impact than anything you can find in the other routes. And talking about Shiki's intense love and repressed lust, this guy simply delivers the single best declaration of love I've ever read in an otome game. Every otome beau can come up with run-of-the-mill sentences such as \"I love you so much\" and \"I want to be by your side forever\"; but Shiki cranks up the passion and comes up with a declaration that makes you feel the love & the lust. Heck, I swear I fell in love with him for a split second when I saw him bare his heart in such an ardent way.— This is a route that respects its peers. I usually despise true routes for their annoying habit of casting all the routes that preceeded them as redundant and pointless and making the player feel like they've been betting on the wrong horse all that time — and I like Shiki's route for abstaining from all that. As a matter of fact, all PC routes have the exact same outcome, namely the destruction of the Period Cube and World V and Shiki's return to the real world sans memories; the only thing that varies is the beau that winds up on Kazuha's arm. Shiki's route is what all true routes should be: a route that explains the story's ins and outs while coexisting peacefully with its fellow regular routes. The fact that it can be unlocked at the halfway point depending on which routes you played first is quite telling: this is but a mere route amongst others, a route that ain't a league of its own.How Poyo-Poyo's route — and by extension the whole story — could have been better: — Scrap the whole Akashic Records deus ex machina. It's a fascinating concept I'd certainly like to learn more about, but it has no place in PC's story. If we assume that Shiki could have discovered a way to separate the soul from the body on his own, we have to admit that the Akashic Records have been implemented solely to allow Kazuha to go back in time, avoid the accident and spare Shiki the whole descent into madness he had to endure after said accident; and not only is it a frustrating plot device that comes completely out of left field, but it also cancels the whole Shiki route and makes it null and void. Now look, game: I don't want to be told that all the developments I witnessed and rooted for never happened, nor do I want to be fed a bloody ellipsis and told that Kazuha fell in love with Shiki this time around without getting the opportunity to see said falling in love with my own eyes. What I wanted was to see Kazuha uncover and acknowledge her love for Shiki in Shiki's route. If she fell head over heels in love with Hiroya in a couple of days despite never seeing him as anything more than a friend before that, then surely it would have been possible to do the same thing with Shiki, now wouldn't it? Just let her realise that her feelings for Shiki are deeper and stronger than she thought and come to terms with them, and voila! Definitely less far-fetched and more believable in the story's context than that whole time travel crap. — Concurrently, tone down Shiki's endeavours in Arcadia and cut down on the insanity, so that he can live on without being tortured by remorse and doesn't require a reboot to live a happy life. Scrap the player killing, the nocturnal fondling, the experimentation on Natsu, the jealousy bouts and the overarching sick desire to preserve Kazuha's soul and memories forever like a twisted trophy — all the more so as it's highly improbable that someone could be driven over the edge so severely just because their stepsister landed in a non-lethal accident and lost a couple of trivial memories. Replace those twisted antics with more interactions with Kazuha in Arcadia, and let the girl realise that she sees Shiki as more than a mere stepbrother. Proceed then to reveal that Kazuha loves Shiki and that they can be together in the real world, and make Shiki drop his mad plan to focus on his dream come true. Arcadia players are spared, everybody is freed from Server V and can go on with their lives, Shiki and Kazuha become an item, The End. More romance, less craziness, and happier players — both Arcadia and Period Cube ones.— Better still, scrap the whole World V, Amadeus and Period Cube shebang entirely, and also scrap that lame accident while you're at it. Use the following premise instead: Shiki is buckling under the pressure of his unrequited love for Kazuha, and he's recently become an hikikomori that plays some Arcadia all day long to get away from the dire reality of his life. Everybody is at a loss, but ingenious little Kazuha comes up with the idea of creating her own Arcadia avatar to reach out to Shiki from inside the game. Proceed then to slowly reveal Shiki's feelings and make Kazuha realise the true depth of her love for him, which she had never dared to acknowledge in earnest because of their family situation. Then crown it all with a good ending in which they end up together and Shiki goes back to his happy straight-A student self, and a bad ending in which he doesn't dare to confess to Kazuha and retreats even deeper into his room and Arcadia. The beauty of that premise is that it would also make the other routes more interesting, by allowing Kazuha and her beau du jour to interact both in Arcadia and the real world and get to know each other over a much longer time period. Cherry on the cake, you don't even need to alter Shiki's destiny in these other routes: just make him loose his memories because of the sheer shock of seeing Kazuha fall in love with another man, and you're covered. (Heck, it's not even that improbable IRL.) Call the whole thing 'Arcadia: Shackles of Love&Despair' and you're good to go! Such a straightforward and unfussy story would flow much more naturally and spare us the many plotholes PC bristles with.So, you may ask, you declare your love for Shiki's route yet claim in the next breath that it should have been entirely different? Yup, that's totally what I'm doing. I loved Shiki's route, the passion and intensity of it; but had it unfolded the way I just described, I would have adored it. I would certainly have adored the other routes as well and ultimately purchased a physical copy of Period Cube, which is something that's definitely not going to happen with the story being the mess it is. That's sad, because there was some potential for stellar love stories and even — let's dream wildly — dashes of RPG-inspired gameplay. Well, maybe the next romantic VN will prove better — because indeed, I got my paws on a couple more of these during the January PSN sale; and since I'm still very much in the mood for love, I'll put them to the Shall We Get Physical test without delay. Better strike while the iron is hot, indeed! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Period Cube: Pick your poison", "date": "07/02/2018", "text": "A.k.a. the route report I promised you, folks. Let's face it: overall, all the beaus in Period Cube are temperamental little pricks that don't deserve Kazuha's favour — and by extension mine — and their romances with the lead lady pack very little romantism and hardly more plausibility. Without further ado, let's get to the whipping! (Spoilers ahead!)Astrum: Making cool, calm and collected Astrum an awkward and grumpy nerd in real life was a neat idea and an unexpected twist. However, the game spoils that premise by piling up the flaws and making Astrum also jealous, pervy, domineering and rude. Like, how dare you call me an idiot when I'm professing my love for you, you ungrateful little nerdo? Do you want to get laid or not? The way you insisted on applying healing balm on Kazuha's thighs, I'd have thought you were desperately hungry for it. Honestly, if I want a fulfilling love story with a geek, I'd rather go for Meoshi in Sweet Fuse; because as it is, Astrum is merely a creepier, nerdier and skinnier version of Kent from Amnesia:Memories. Demento: That route is a complete joke. On top of being a truncated route that branches off Astrum's route quite late into the game, it also features a bloodthirsty nutcase that beats Kazuha and proudly flaunts his love for murder. I'm sure this route wasn't initially planned, and I can nearly hear someone at Otomate scream: \"Shoot, we forgot to add a psycho route! Let's fix something before the game ships!\" Said game would definitely have been better off without that pint-sized excuse for a route. Hiroya: A.k.a. the token childhood friend consumed with unrequited love. He's the teary-eyed guy on the cover art; and he has good reasons to cry, since he has to watch Kazuha cavort with other guys in all routes but his. I could nearly pity the poor thing, if not for the fact that he's a sullen and immature brat with a high-maintenance streak. The way he harasses Kazuha and demands that she relies on him more while throwing tantrums when she doesn't is not exactly a caring behaviour in my book. Not to mention that, why don't you just prove that you're reliable, instead of coercing me into leaning upon you? Sour cherry on the cake, Hiroya gets all flustered when Kazuha shows him her love and blames her for embarrassing him. Wait, you've been in love with me forever, and now that you got what you wanted, you're playing all coy and bitchy? Stop being hot&cold and make up your mind, boy.Libera: Have you ever fantasized about a slice of yuri in your otome? Now your dream can come true thanks to Libera, a boy who masquerades as a girl in Arcadia. Libera is actually one of the best bachelors, boasting a playful streak and a touching backstory, but his posturing as a female somewhat soils his route. You could tell that the writers themselves were not completely at ease with that premise, because they made his Arcadia character model completely devoid of bosom, bottom or any other distinctive female attribute and gave him instead the same willowy body sported by all the bachelors — only with skimpy clothing. I can't help but think that if they were not going to go full force and make him a buxom female, they should simply have stuck with his male identity. Zain: A.k.a. Mr. Plothole. Why this guy is even part of the bachelor crew is a mystery to me: as an NPC, he has no volition whatsoever and gains a will of his own solely through accidentally fusing with Demento. Ensue weird events and plotholes by the truckload, until Zain is somehow magically warped into the real world while retaining his Arcadia appearance. Now wait a minute, game: how is that even remotely possible? Okay, Zain fused with Demento in Arcadia, and it's implied that the former is hosted in the latter's body in the real world; but how can Zain modify Demento's facial features to make them look like his own? The answer is simple: he cannot, and that turn of events was implemented solely to spare the player the twisted outcome of having a romance with a Zain looking like Demento. Radius: Okay, now I'm pissed. You had one simple job, game: to make my fellow solo runner Radius a compelling character with a good backstory — and you screwed it royally. You want me to believe that this guy was actually a regular party runner that got traumatized because he had to abandon his party to save his life, and that he's been running solo ever since to avoid reliving that trauma? How asinine is that? Couldn't you come up with a more believable solo runner, i.e. a guy who runs solo because he's a genuine lone wolf yet warms up to love and company upon meeting Kazuha? Also, you want me to believe that this guy is actually an idol in real life? If he were really an idol, he would be slaving away for his label, not running solo in an MMORPG. The romance is also way too rushed in that route, with Kazuha claiming that she wants to make Radius happy and doesn't want to be separated from him a mere day after meeting him. That's too fast, even for Period Cube.Well, I'm done with the route report. But wait, I hear you ask; what about Poyo-Poyo's route? Well, Poyo-Poyo's route is a bit of a special case: as the true route and the only route I genuinely enjoyed, it deserves its own dedicated post. Thanks for reading, and by my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Period Cube: Not worth its case", "date": "04/02/2018", "text": "Its plastic case, that is. See, I have a new approach regarding Vita VNs with a romantic overtone: since many of these games hold little to no replay value as far as I'm concerned, I've decided to use the PSN sales to purchase them digitally at a bargain price. If it turns out that I love them and can see myself replaying them at some point, then — and only then — will I go for a physical copy. Period Cube is the first discounted otome VN I got my digital paws on, and the first to be put to the Shall We Get Physical test.Having said that, let's cut to the chase: Period Cube is neither a good VN nor a good otome game. Not only will I certainly not invest in a physical copy of that game, but I really think that Period Cube was not worthy of a physical Western release and should have been a digital-only game with a $20 price tag. That may seem a bit harsh, especially coming from a collector that advocate physical games for life at every turn; but PC is simply too much of a half-baked game to deserve a full-price boxed release. (Spoilers ahead!)Why PC is not a good VN: —It's not explicit enough. PC is your typical \"How the heck did I end up here and why the heck is this happening\" story, and such stories require meaty explanations at the end. Loose ends must be tied, and all mysteries must be laid down in a satisfactory way; and that is exactly what PC cheekily chooses to dispense with, preferring instead to drop allusions and lapidary statements in a nearly offhanded way and let the player put two and two together. Because of that, misunderstandings can easily arise despite the fact that the story is really simple and straightforward when put down on paper. For instance, Shiki never clearly states that he uses World V both as a tool to hone his custom-made soul-trapping process and a way to lure the strong players who carry the data needed for the final Period Cube update. He never explains properly that he was planning to wield the Almighty power himself as a sub-character on his Arcadia account and that Kazuha gained said Almighty power by mistake when she created a sub-character from his computer. Nor does he fully explain that the whole \"Trilogy of Swords\" setting was a mere scheme whose sole purpose was to lure powerful players to the Ark in order to feed their data to the Period Cube, and that himself was supposed to lead said powerful players — including the bearers of the two other swords — as the wielder of the Almighty power. And so on and so forth. It's annoying to have to rack your brain to figure out why things unfolded the way they did when a five-minute explanation from Shiki would have done the trick.—It's stuffed with incoherencies and plotholes. Like, why would Shiki carelessly let his PC running and connected to World V, when he knows fully well that Kazuha has the keys to his flat and can waltz in whenever she pleases? How can NPC Zain appear in the real world with the exact same body and voice as in the game? Why does Shiki only gains theorical knowledge about how to separate the soul from the body when he visits the Akashic Records and has to work for years to implement what he learnt, when Kazuya gets to travel back in time instantly like she's been making a wish to a lamp genie? Et cetera, et cetera. If there's one thing I hate more than stories that don't explain themselves properly, it's definitely stories whose plot looks like honeycomb.—It's brimming over with ad hoc. The guys always arrive precisely at the right moment to get dumb little Kazuha out of a bind, dumb little Kazuha always gets to use the Almighty power precisely when she needs it, information always drops in the characters' lap precisely when they need it, and so on — and let's not even talk about the Akashic Records, a.k.a. the most shameless deus ex machina of them all. It becomes so transparent after a while that you stop caring about the characters because you know they'll never be in real trouble.Why PC is not a good otome game: —L'amour comes into the picture way too fast. There is no common route apart from a tiny branching prologue, and the romancing starts literally five minutes after you boot up the game. When I started my run, it actually took me a while to realize that I was locked on a guy's route and that I had to start hitting on him — so much so that I had to restart the route to get the 'right' answers I'd missed. Because of that lack of a common route, you don't get to know the guys and grow attached to them before getting the opportunity to woo them, which makes said wooing a bit forced and vacant. I know we're here to bag up dudes first and last, but surely a bit of exposition and preparation wouldn't hurt? The way PC rushes things, I feel like I'm playing \"Dogs in heat: The game\" rather than an otome VN.—Kazuha is too painfully transparent to make a believable love interest. I cannot believe for a second that all these guys are fawning over a girl that dull and devoid of personality. Heck, I'm supposed to be her and I cannot figure her out, so how can these dudes fall for her like she's a femme fatale? The game repeatedly states that she's kind, optimistic and always smiling, but is it really enough to make her that irresistible? On the other hand, all these dudes seem to be virgins, so maybe that's why they melt when a woman smiles their way.—The guys are too similar. They're all feisty young men with the same lithe body, the same tousled hair and the same eye-rolling tendency to get embarrassed and peevish when Kazuha expresses her love for them. Now look, you little b*tches: I'm about to put you out of your virgin misery, so stop acting like darn tsunderes and show some gratitude already. To be fair, I think the problem is not so much the sameness of the guys as the fact that I'm not exactly the target audience. PC is obviously aimed at teenage girls, who can undoubtedly appreciate those androgynous princes charming much better than I ever could. As for me, I would have preferred more variety in terms of body shape, age and behaviour.Now, did I hate Period Cube? Absolutely not. Although it qualifies neither as a good VN nor as a good otome in my book, I had a good time playing it and there were a couple of things I genuinely liked. For one thing, Arcadia boasts the most gorgeous colour palette I've seen in a video game ever — heck, I sure wish I could get trapped in a game world boasting those lush crystalline hues. For another, the secondary characters were really endearing — especially the Forte crew, whose dynamics were hilarious and whose bond came across much more blatantly than Kazuha's supposed bond with her beaus. And there was also that route — the route that blew me away and somehow made the whole game worth playing. And talking about routes, I'll be back soon with a full-blown run report. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Etrian Odyssey: That difficult second stratum", "date": "30/01/2018", "text": "I'm done with EO's second stratum, and let me tell you: I'm glad. I'm glad that darn Primitive Jungle is behind me, and I don't want to roam it again before a very, very long time.To be fair, that second stratum was not nearly as hard as the first; but what it lacked in difficulty, it made up for in sheer tediousness. It boasted tons of FOEs that respawned at the speed of light and had to be eliminated on a regular basis for unhindered roaming, damage floors, trash mobs hell-bent on poisoning me, hidden passageways, stealth sessions — in a word, the whole shebang of first-person dungeon crawler obnoxiousness. On top of that, I was really not fond of that stratum's look, with its dull and dark colour palette that contained way too much black for my retinas' liking. Are jungles really that dark? And if they are, do we really need game jungles to be realistic? I'd have preferred deep and lush shades of green rather than this depressing mix of black and khakies. But all these annoyances pale in comparison to the second stratum's main irritant, which was none other than the bloody backtracking. I honestly don't think I've encountered a worse case of backtracking in any RPG ever. The whole stratum was a nasty case of two steps forward, three steps back: crawl a bit, retreat, save, crawl a bit further, kill some FOEs, retreat, save — rinse and repeat for a number of hours I'm glad I don't get to know. That number of hours was pretty indecent, if my lone ranger's progression is any indication: I gained 30 levels in that stratum alone, and I gained them solely through backtracking, with not a shred of dedicated level-grinding involved. I don't know if I should be happy or mortified, honestly.Regardless of how I feel about that second stratum, there's no denying that this is the stratum that made me stupidly strong and indecently oveleveled. On top of the 30 level package, I gained access to the powerful skill Smite, which could as well as been called \"let's bulldoze that FOE in three turns, b*tch\". FOE fights are now only marginally harder than the average trash mob fight, and I can easily handle several of these nasties in a row — or even at once. How do you like my fighting now, you bullies? I used to tremble at the sight of you, but I'm all grown and leveled-up now. (Cue evil laugh.)Anyway, I'm standing on the very first squares of the third stratum, which is already promising a much more pleasant roaming by sheer virtue of its gorgeous crystalline blue colour palette. I think I'm going to take a one-day break from the game, because that cursed Primitive Jungle really drained me; but I'm already itching at the thought of exploring that splendid oceanic third stratum. I'll see you later with tidings of the Azure Rainforest, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Code:Realize: Here we go again", "date": "27/01/2018", "text": "I'm just done replaying Code:Realize, folks. Now, why replay that game, a mere year after I wrote two unflattering posts about it? Well, I could tell you that I'm playing a super-grindy game these days and need a lighter game on the side to unwind, or I could tell you that I'm usually in the mood for VN in the winter; but the bottom line is that my gaming instinct wanted to revisit that game for some unfathomable reason — and where my gaming instinct tells me to go, I go.Not only did I replay C:R, but I replayed every single route — and I'm glad I did, because it gave me a new appreciation of that game. To sum it up neatly: everything I said about C:R last year still stands, and yet I like that game nonetheless. I'm not sure why I like it, to be honest. I could try to come up with reasons, such as the lush SFX, the gorgeous colours, the characters' mannerisms, the whole atmosphere; but I'll rather leave it at that and simply enjoy the fact that C:R was not such a bad investment after all. I mean, nobody said love had to be rational, right? Having said that, I still have some criticism in store for C:R — because indeed, it's very much a case of tough love between me and that game. First, a quick route review (minor spoilers):Victor: Just as perfect as the first time. For me, Victor is Cardia's canon mate, and nothing will make me bulge. The clever way Victor figures out a solution to suppress Cardia's poison is deliciously satisfying, and the smooth way he saves her and London in the nick of time while slipping in a steamy moment is even more satisfying. Impey: Still nice, entertaining and very Jules Verne-ish. Still no chemistry between Impey and Cardia, but that cannot be helped. Saint-Germain: Now that I knew what to expect, that route felt a tad less weird. Still, events there are a bit too far-fetched for my taste. Why would anybody go as far as Saint-Germain does for the sake of a single person? And the whole \"we'll shape our destiny ourselves\" motto has been worn out by scores of JRPGs already and has no more lustre to offer. Van Helsing: Mr Iceberg's attitude was slightly less intolerable this time around — heck, I could even spot flashes of niceness towards Cardia here and there. Still, that route is by far the weakest when it comes to narrative content. You want me to swallow that Aleister manipulated events around Van Helsing for years just for the sake of traumatizing the latter, and that Van Helsing's feelings for Cardia allowed Aleister to add the final touch to his twisted oeuvre? I mean, Van Helsing doesn't manifest Hidden Strength in the other routes, so it's obviously Cardia's love that makes the difference; but why would psycho Aleister give up on his prey so easily in the other routes? On the other hand, why would he go that far in the first place? You're either too crazy or not crazy enough here, mate. Lupin: Just as unconvincing as before. The game tries its hardest to convey romance and to showcase the Frenchman as the perfect bachelor, but I just cannot feel l'amour there. Now for the biggest bite, i.e. Cardia's overarching story. Oh boy, is there a lot to say about it. There are so many problematic things there that I don't know where to start. Well, maybe by saying that the biggest issue is not so much Cardia herself, but rather her father Isaac, whose decisions make absolutely no sense in the context of the story. (SPOILERS again!) Incoherency#1: Isaac abandoning Cardia in a remote mansion instead of locking her up in his headquarters. I know I mentioned this before, and I know I'm supposed to exert suspension of disbelief here; but I'm sorry, this premise is just too far-fetched to swallow. The story goes to painfully great lengths to establish that Cardia's Horologium is of paramount importance and holds the key to Isaac's entire masterplan; and yet you want me to believe that Isaac casually let Cardia frolic around in the boonies, free to attract unwanted attention and be abducted by any random madman wanting the Horologium for himself? Either that guy is a complete moron, or this a a very transparent plot device to allow the story to unfold the way it does — and I'd wager it's the latter indeed. Incoherency#2: Isaac recreating his children only to kill them off. On one hand, he claims upon dying that the only thing he wanted was to be one with his family again; yet on the other hand, he tells Cardia that he doesn't like her and that she's only a pale copy of his beloved daughter. So what does he want exactly? Did he clone his children hoping to recreate his happy family, only to realize that he couldn't love them after all? Now that would be fickle. Incoherency#3: Isaac turning himself into pure spirit and letting a clone of his son take care of his masterplan in his stead. How did he achieve that state in the first place? And why would he all of a sudden entrust the son he always despised with such a mammoth task? Given the story's fantastic nature, having Isaac being alive and well and planning to fuse his original physical body with Cardia's Horologium after using the pendant on it would have made just as much sense as doing these things as a big ball of something with Finis' help. I'm afraid we're privy to another plot device here: keeping Isaac as an ethereal presence makes him more threatening and unescapable, as well as more akin to the god he wants to become. Too bad it doesn't also make sense in the grand scheme of things, really. Incoherency#4: The slaughtering of Isaac's family and Isaac's subsequent madness. Sure, rural folk in C:R are routinely described as subhumans, always ready to harass and wrongly accuse innocent people; but killing the entire family of the doctor that served them for years just because they feel he might be responsible of the current famine is too much, even for them. Isaac's reaction to that event is no more believable — so your family has been murdered, and the first thing that comes to your mind is \"I'll become a new god\"? How about something less far-fetched, like \"I'll torture and murder all them pigs that did that\"? Once again, plot devices: a forced and overblown trigger to a no less forced and overblown change of character.   In a nutshell: Isaac is an half-baked villain, he makes no sense whatsoever as a character, and nearly all his decisions are mere plot devices that exist solely to further narrative developments. Too bad it's so painfully transparent. There are also a couple of minor non-Isaac-related plotholes that bothered me, such as:Cardia and Finis being twins: Really? Cardia looks at least five years older than Finis, if not more. Lupin rescuing Cardia just before Isaac is done absorbing all her poison: Sure, that's a neat narrative trick, and a no less neat way to let Cardia live as a normal person... That is, until you start thinking about it in earnest. Like, how on earth did Lupin know when the poison was about to run out? Sheer luck, obviously! And how did he know which amount would be necessary to let Cardia live a normal lifespan without emitting poison? Sheer luck again! Yeah, more like \"shut up and suspend your disbelief, b*tch\". Horologium tautology: Okay, so the Horologium needs to spend some time in a living being to reach its ultimate state. Regular humans couldn't survive the stone's poison, so Isaac created an Homunculus (i.e. Cardia) to bear it. Fine; but given that the Horologium is the very thing that keeps Cardia alive, how does she qualify as the living being that will allow the Horologium to mature? She wouldn't be alive if not for the stone, so she's not really a living being after all. Or can the Horologium feast on the very life it grants Cardia? This is all quite unclear, and it looks too much like a logical fallacy for comfort. Geez, that's a lot of writing for a game I already played once! But when all is said and done, I like Code:Realize despite its flaws. I like it so much, in fact, that I firmly plan on purchasing the sequel that's slated for release in early 2018. Heck, I even have a wishlist for that sequel: I want a Delacroix route, because Delacroix is a sheep in wolf's clothing and seeing him getting all flustered at Cardia's wooing attempts would be hilarious. I also want an Aleister route, because every Otomate game needs a sir psycho sexy as a love interest; and I'd even like a Finis route for the sake of 'blooming-love-overcoming-deep-seated-hate', if not for the fact that Finis is Cardia's brother and is feasting on the flowers. Oh, and I also wanna see Victoria and Leonhardt tie the knot. Let's hope that the sequel will make some of these wishes come true! I'll see you later with more Code:Realize tidings, dear fellow gamers; as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Etrian Odyssey: The first fight is the hardest", "date": "24/01/2018", "text": "I'm mad, mad, mad about that game. I'm hooked, hypnotized and glued to my DS screen, craving for more. If Ray Gigant made me doubt my undying and ardent love for first-person dungeon crawlers for a split second, Etrian Odyssey gloriously reasserted the vibrancy and intensity of that love. I'm loving that game much more than I ever though I could, actually: I half-expected an unpolished early-era DS game with clunky controls, crappy graphics and player-unfriendly features up the wazoo, but what I got instead was a well-crafted and challenging game with an unique and enthralling vibe. I've been playing for one week and just cleared Yggdrasil's first stratum, so now's the perfect time for a small break and a progress report.Meet Wolf, sole member of the Cruiser guild. (Yup, that's totally a reference to 'lone wolf'. Sue me for my poor taste in MC names, I don't mind.^^) She's one of the character models featured on the game's cover art, which gives me the satisfying feeling that she's somehow supposed to be the hero of the game to begin with; and she's also a Protector (in other words, a tank), which is undoubtedly one of the best suited classes for solo endeavours in EO. High defense, decent attack and healing skills, what more could you ask for for your one and only? Well, probably better foraging skills and a higher agility, because little Wolfie lacks a bit on that front. But hey, solo runs are all about choices and sacrificing some stats and abilities for the sake of others, so I won't complain — all the less so as my lone Protector is doing a stellar job at exploring Yggdrasil so far.The Death Row.As expected from a hardcore FPDC, the early stages were hard. Like, soul-shatteringly, weepingly hard. It was all about surviving the very first battle, i.e. the hardest battle of them all: I knew that if I could survive that first battle and make it back to town, I would be on a roll. It took me many a try and many a Game Over, but I finally succeeded and could breath a long-awaited sigh of relief. Or, to quote Beatrix Kiddo in Kill Bill, \"hard's part over\"! Well, not quite yet — or, to quote O-Ren in Kill Bill, \"you didn't think it was gonna be that easy, did you?\" The following battles were just as tough, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I died dozens of times on the first floor and spent my first hour of play roaming the six squares right in front the exit and retiring to town to save after every single battle. That being said, I also have to admit that I unwillingly made things harder for myself by not checking the local shops and purchasing better gear and healing items before venturing into the dungeon; but hey, what's done is done, and it was a thrilling challenge anyway, so I regret nothing.A lot of time has passed since those fateful first steps (although I cannot tell exactly how long, because EO doesn't track playing time) and things have changed for the better. I roamed, grinded and grew stronger, going from a wimp cowering in fear at the sight of a butterfly to a ruthless fighter eating FOEs for breakfast — and lunch, high tea and dinner, for that matter. Game Overs have become few and far between, and I can safely claim that no battle on the first five floors poses a genuine threat anymore. Even first boss Fenrir couldn't resist the assaults of my lone ranger, and I put the nasty beast to rest after using a couple of devious tricks to separate him from his vulpine minions. (Why is a saber-toothed tiger the leader of a pack of wolves, I wonder.) You didn't think I was going to fight all of you at once, did you? I'm kinda overleveled, sure, but not that overleveled. Not yet, that is. (Cue evil grin.)EO's atmosphere is something else, really. None of the FPDC I've played so far manages to combine so perfectly and expertly a peaceful and soothing vibe with a sense of menace and impending doom. Class of Heroes has the latter without the former, Demon Gaze has the former without the latter, but only EO has the whole package. The crystalline colours, the mellow soundtrack and the exquisite sound of crushed grass under my feet make me want to to roam endlessly; yet at the same time, every step feels like a step closer to a Game Over. I genuinely feared going deeper into the labyrinth during the early stages, and I swear I felt my throat tighten the very first time I lay my eyes on a FOE. This is a potent and striking mix, and I'm not going to forget my first impressions of that game any time soon — even though by now, Yggdrasil has lost a lot of its chilling power thanks to my dutiful grinding.I'm surprised that such a fuss was made about the map drawing feature, when it's a totally superfluous task that can be ignored for the most part. There is an auto-drawing map option; and while it doesn't show walls, doors and harvesting spots, those can be added afterwards — like, when one is safely back to town. Drawing walls is by far the most time-consuming task, and it's not even necessary to navigate the labyrinth. Check the map on the side: the left half shows a fully completed map, while the right half is solely the product of auto-drawing, with a couple of door icons added — as you can see, the latter is explicit enough and perfectly serviceable. For all intents and purposes, map drawing in EO is just a flashy gimmick that's here primarily to help the series stand out from the dungeon-crawler crowd. Mind you, I'm not complaining; I was actually afraid of disliking the series because of that very feature, and I'm glad that it turned out to be nothing more than an innocuous gimmick. In fact, I even enjoy fine-tuning my map once I'm done exploring a floor.In a nutshell: I adore that game, and I'm gonna keep playing it for a long time. Brace yourself, second stratum, for here I come! I'll see you soon with a second progress report, dear fellow gamers; until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Generation of Chaos - Pandora's Reflection: Final thoughts", "date": "21/01/2018", "text": "Well, I'm done with Pandora's Reflection for now. A second run with my overpowered duo was darn tempting, but I was just dying to play *name hidden for suspense's sake* and that took precedence. So here comes my final opinion about the game, warts and all.This is a PSP budget game, with the good and bad points of such games. I like the lo-fi charm of budget offerings from that console generation, so I was delighted and felt right at home. That lovely fuzziness! Those charming non-animated skits! Those nostalgia-inducing pixelated 2D sprites! Gimme more! What I didn't like so much, on the other hand, was how dark the game was — like, in every sense of the word. From the dull and murky colours to the gloomy story that spares the player no gruesome description of murder, torture and the like, PR did a serious number on my mood after a while. Also, the final boss — the one I fought, that is — is a nasty cheating b*tch. She had as much HP as Claude and Yuri at their max level together, she could teleport, cast spells and heal, she moved four times faster than my duo and, cherry on the cake, she had 25 minions as cannon fodder. How is that fair? It took me no less than four tries to beat her, and boy, did it felt vengefully good. I was initially planning to check the other two endings, but... After that laborious showdown, I really didn't feel like it. Those endings can wait until my next run of PR.  Although I love PR's simplicity and low-fi feel, there's no denying that the gameplay is a bit lacking. This game obviously wants to be the perfect portable SRPG and Visual Novel hybrid, with its short chapters offering narrative developments along with the battle du jour; but alas, the story and battles are too disjointed and this enticing mix never gels. Like, my crew goes on and on endlessly about how weak and fragile Yuri is and how she needs to be protected from harm, when Yuri is actually a warhorse that eats foes for breakfast on the battlefield — cue Underrated and Overleveled. And talking about the battlefield, it's downright silly to see the battles' winning and losing conditions contradict over and over what the narrative struggled to establish just seconds before. Even when the whole crew insists on sparing opponents, seizing enemy positions first and foremost or destroying a given contraption, battles always unfold the exact same way and can ALWAYS be won by slaughtering every living thing in sight and/or taking the enemy base. Take, for instance, that chapter where you're forced to fight brainwashed young orphans: the way the whole crew insists on sparing the kids' lives, you'd think that the ensuing battle would include a losing condition in case too many kids are killed — but NOPE! You can slaughter them all, and you'll win just the same, with hefty amounts of XP in your name! Also, battles that are titled \"Destroy contraption X\" or \"Take position Y\" usually don't even feature the objects in question, let alone the actual opportunity to destroy them! I swear, this became hilarious after a while.But hey, let's be honest: I don't care one bit. I played that game for the battles, the grinding and the duo run thrill, and I got everything I could wish for on that front. The story can get lost for all I care, and so can the rest of the crew. Claude&Yuri forever! I loved that game, and let's face it, I'll probably purchase a Japanese copy of it somewhere down the road. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Generation of Chaos - Pandora's Reflection: It takes two to clear that game", "date": "17/01/2018", "text": "I did it, folks: a true blue duo run of Pandora's Reflection. Claude & Yuri only, all the way to the final boss — and boy, am I proud of that feat. And it was fun, too! Now obviously, that duo run involved copious amounts of level-grinding, along with tweaked battle tactics. Forget about taking enemy positions, forget about weapon complementarities, forget about terrain, forget about all those niceties and subtleties of SRPGs: my main battle tactic consisted of sticking around my base, slaughter all the minions that kindly came down to attack said base and then make a beeline for the boss. Stage done, next! When the number of grunts was too annoyingly high and I didn't feel like taking down all of them, I splitted my duo and let one protect my base and the other slaughter the boss. All in all, those dual tactics worked like a charm. In fact, I daresay that if there ever was an SRPG that lent itself to duo runs/limited party runs, then PR is exactly that game. Not only is it technically possible to run with as little as two units in PR, but the game is actually highly conducive to these types of runs because to the following points:You only get to deploy two units at the beginning of each battle. To be able to deploy more, you have to take so-called unit and/or strategy points first, and then make sure that said points are not invaded by enemies. And it's not like there's hundreds of these points around, oh nooo: even if you take them all, you'll hardly manage to deploy more than three or four extra units. Better save yourself the hassle and make do with what the game gives you, o yes precious.You cannot leave your base unattended at all, lest foes make a beeline for it and take it in the blink of an eye. This means that you can only send a single unit to take unit/strategy points at the beginning of a battle, and that single unit will probably run into tons of enemies on the way. Much better to lounge around the base and take advantage of those sweet, sweet impact circles  until the small fry is disposed of. The battlefield is too small to accommodate many units. We're talking about a single screen here with no scrolling involved, and it can get crowded really fast. Better to have just a few units and a clear view of what you're doing. The enemies are such pushovers that it's not worth over-strategizing. A bit of level-grinding, and you're set! Also, the weapon complementary thing is basically pointless: during my playthrough, I didn't run into a single battle where both of Claude's or Yuri's weapons were weak against their foe's ones. There's really not point in tinkering with units when it only takes two to tango all over enemies' bodies. But hey, I'm not trying to convince anyone to play a duo run of PR. Like, not at all. It's not like I'm a hardcore solo runner that sings solo runs' praises at every turn, now is it? Okay, I'm totally trying to convince you there. But I swear, that's because cruising with Claude and Yuri alone is the perfect treat for grinding aficionados. I had such a blast playing the game with these two that I nearly want to start a New Game + right away. I'm not sure I will, though; there are tons of other games tugging at me, and I'm quite greedy for new playthroughs these days. So I'll come back to you soon with either a post about a second run of PR or a post about my final thoughts about the game, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Utawarerumono-Mask of Deception: I hate cliffhangers (SPOILERS!)", "date": "14/01/2018", "text": "I really, really hate cliffhangers. Wait, did I mention that I hate cliffhangers? I deem them the cheapest narrative trick ever, a dirty way to ensure that the reader/viewer/player/whatever will feel compelled to purchase the sequel. Plus, cliffhangers are nothing but emotional porn designed to tug at one's heartstrings while at the same time leaving them insanely frustrated. Like, how can I not desperately want to buy Mask of Truth after UMoD fed me its heart-wrenching ending? How can I live without knowing if Kuon and Haku are reunited and if Haku's deception is exposed? Heck, just the thought of having to import Mask of Truth and wait a few weeks until it's delivered is killing me right now.Sheesh, that ending royally pisses me off. Not only is it a dirt cheap cliffhanger, but it's a stupid dirt cheap cliffhanger. Having Haku pose as Oshtor makes. absolutely. no. sense. whatsoever. I don't care that this was Ohstor's last wish; it's pretty obvious right off the bat that Haku is going to buckle under the pressure of impersonating someone else sooner or later and that the whole scheme is bound to fail. (Just ask Jean-Claude Romand how that crap worked for him.) Why not let Kuon know? Why not let the whole crew know, for that matter? If this was indeed Oshtor's last wish that Haku pose as him, as the game implies, then it's pretty obvious that Oshtor made that demand for his countrymen's sake, so that they have a trusted leader figure to look up to. As for the crew, they would sure prefer to have Haku at their side rather than Oshtor; not to mention that Haku's deception would be more likely to last if he had accomplices. So why? Heck, I think I know the answer: to create more drama and ensure that players will purchase Mask of Truth without fail.Well, I certainly will do that — and not for the cliffhanger's sake, mind you. I had lots of fun playing UMoD and totally want more of it. Sure, it was not perfect by any means: the story was too disjointed at times, the characters' behaviour had me rolling my eyes more than once, and I swear I wanted to punch Nekone into oblivion when she nearly ruined Oshtor's chances to win the final fight by throwing a tantrum like the unsufferable immature brat she is; but overall, it was still a darn good game. The battles were fun, with just the right dose of strategy and challenge to be entertaining without being frustrating, and the story mixed heartwarming, humorous and dramatic moments to great effect, with a couple of expertly handled plot twists to boot. Oh, and I'm totally mad about Kuon. Seeing her go away tore my heart out, and I swear I wanted to run after her, hug her and beg her to stay. Oh Haku, you're such a prick for putting Kuon and myself through that emotional wringer. Since I mentioned the story, I'm kinda glad that it picked up the pace and offered more intense developments than these endless slices of life I deplored in my last post. I now see those as innocuous fillers, necessary to build up relationships between characters and lighten up the atmosphere — although these moments irritated me more than anything. I'm just a tad disappointed that the writers resorted to the overused 'Super Mode' trope; I've read a couple too many shonens exploiting that stuff to not get completely blasé about it. Also, the story was sometimes a tad too morally twisted for straight-laced old me: on top of Nekone lusting for her bro, we have Atuy's dad loving his daughter in a a suspiciously intense way, and Woshis using his personal posse of young servant boys as models for the yaoi mangas he secretly draws. But hey, this is pretty standard anime fare after all; and I sure played plenty of Vita games that were much more hentai-ridden than that without batting an eyelid, so I guess I have no ground for complaining.With that said, dear fellow gamers, I'll see you later for Mask of Truth — that is, when I'm done importing it, which may or may not happen soon. Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Generation of Chaos - Pandora's Reflection: Grinding it my way", "date": "10/01/2018", "text": "A couple of years ago, I would have sternly refused to play Pandora's Reflection without playing its two prequels first. But the times, they have a-changed; and since my gaming instinct was dead set on playing that game and wouldn't be swayed, I had no choice but to comply and play. And I'm glad I did, because I had an instant crush on Pandora's Reflection. I mean, it was simply impossible not to have a crush on an RPG that let me fight my first battle after two minutes and grind my party to level 15 in the first hour of play. It also looks deliciously PSP, with that unmistakable PSP fuzziness — and the annoying collateral effect that you cannot take screenshots. Last but not least, it has that telltale Sting quirkiness, with a weapon appraising system reminiscent of Hexyz Force and a fighting system that's an uncanny mix of RTS-lite and QTE-meets-Rhythm game.Back when I got my paws on the Generation of Chaos PSP trilogy, I remember being annoyed by the fact that PR was the only entry that didn't get a physical release on our shores; but now that I'm playing it, I somehow understand why. This is a very bare-bones game whose development budget was probably close to non-existent: graphics are 16-bit level, the whole story is told through fixed screens with not a single cutscene in sight, and the gameplay is barely deeper than your average phone game. (On the other hand, PR is fully voiced, which makes me question Sting's and IF's sense of priorities.) The series has been dormant ever since the release of PR, so I guess that game was really Sting and IF trying to scrape enough money to give the series an ultimate instalment. Or maybe they wanted to ditch the series altogether and used that opportunity to go budget and try a couple of gameplay mechanics that were not typical of the series. Who knows?At any rate, I'm enjoying that game. I love simple games as a rule, and I love grindy games as well; and given than PR is both simple and grindy, we very much have a match made in heaven there. It should surprise no one that I'm fighting Free Battles by the truckload, reaping metric tons of XP and fun in the process. But hey, how do you expect me to be fulfilled with one mere battle at a time? I know that's how SRPGs roll, but hey, I want more. It should also surprise no one that my grinding focuses solely on Claude and Yuri and that I've been playing solely with these two so far: they were the first two characters introduced, and as far as I'm concerned, they are the game's true heroes. Everybody else is a mere extra that may not even stick around till the bitter end for all I know; so as long as the game doesn't go all Luminous Arc on me by pitting me against a cheated boss, I'll cruise with Claude and Yuri alone. And mind you, I'm not sure I could play otherwise even if I wanted to; multitasking is not my strongest suit, and I already have enough trouble as it is keeping track of my duo's and their foes' manoeuvres without throwing extra units into the mix. So let's hope that Claude and Yuri alone will do the trick and that I won't come back to you with PR tidings involving extra units or untimely quitting, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Utawarerumono-Mask of Deception: A bouncy ride", "date": "06/01/2018", "text": "I'm not sure where this game and its story are headed, but I'm kinda happy to be part of the ride. Utawererumono: Mask of Deception (referred to as UMoD from hereon) is a strange beast of a game, a meaty visual novel with intermittent battle sections that doesn't seem to know exactly what kind of story it wants to tell and what kind of atmosphere it wants to craft. Things started ominously enough, with amnesiac hero Haku waking up in a completely foreign world and being rescued in the nick of time by mysterious lone ranger Kuon. Ensued a bunch of terrifying events, such as attacks by giants insects and bandits, and the introduction of a couple of interesting characters; combined with Haku's glaring disconnect with his surroundings and the burgeoning of a quiet yet intense relationship with Kuon, we were seemingly headed towards a intense tale of mystery, love and recovered memories.A couple of hours later, things have derailed pretty severely. Ever since Haku and his small crew set foot in the Yamato Imperial Capital, the story has shifted focus from Haku's lost memories and attempts to understand his new foreign world to mundane events such as bath-dipping, chatting with merchants and cooking sweets. The game has also deprived me of my sweet intimacy with Kuon by throwing at my face tons of new female characters that eat a lot of screentime and have pushed my lovely Kuon into the background. For all intents and purposes, my intense tale of mystery, love and recovered memories has slowly but surely morphed into a slice-of-life harem anime. How did it get to this? This is not what I signed for, and this is certainly not what the game's early stages led me to expect.Mind you, I wouldn't mind that change of tone that much if not for the fact that the new female recrues are all unsufferable brats and that the story is now brimming with the worst clichés under the anime sun. Tsundere teenage b*tch who despises the hero? Check. Unwilling peeping at naked female characters in the bath, followed by hefty punishment? Check. The hero being blamed by all the girls for a bad turn of events he's not even responsible for? Check. The list goes on and on, and so does the parade of annoying characters the game is throwing at me. Like, I've hardly gotten used to bratty tsundy Nekone, and now the game is pushing first-class spoiled little minx Anju on me, who is ten times the brat Nekone is! Can you please let me catch my breath between blows, game? To add insult to injury, Haku, and by extension myself, must endure a nearly constant assassination of character by this bunch of nasty broads. I'm routinely called a pervert, a slob, a bum, and blamed for this, that and the other. Heck, even loving and protective Kuon has joined the fray and started unwinding at my expense, going from a dignified mother-like figure to a grumpy teenager in a matter of chapters. And mind you, those girls are far from being perfect enough to judge me. Like, how dare Nekone, of all people, call me a pervert? Hey, I'm not the one lusting after my own brother here, b*tch. And how dare Rulutieh look down on me for having scantily clad females in my entourage, when she owns stacks upon stacks of graphic yaoi manga? Typical case of the pot calling the kettle black, if you ask me.But hey, let's chalk up my dislike of the narrative's current style to the fact that harem manga and anime have never been my cup of tea; and let's heartily move on to the game's positive sides, the main one being the battle segments. Those battles are more than mere diversions: there's a real, solid fighting system at work there, with levels, skills, attack ranges and the like, and it makes those engagements really engrossing. Even better, you can actually level-grind by fighting free battles! Needless to say, I overindulged in said free battles, especially when the story got on my nerves. Cherry on the cake, steering my crew on the battlefield and seeing their awesome fighting prowess helps me forget their annoying antics and tantrums and makes me love them more. Other highlights are the great soundtrack, the easy-on-the-eye character design and the depth of the game world, which was given a lovingly crafted set of customs, myths, folktales and the like — heck, even confectionaries have their own dedicated entries in the glossary. And there's also the whole atmosphere — that is, if we ever get out of those slice-of-life, harem-ish meanderings and go back on track to pursue Haku's lost memories. So here I am, enjoying the ride while fervently hoping that UMoD won't pull a Steins;Gate on me by bastardizing its own narrative beyond repair. I've been playing for roughly 15 hours, and if internet lore about UMoD is to be believed, I still have a good number of playing hours ahead. See you soon with more Utawarerumono tidings, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "New gaming year", "date": "01/01/2018", "text": "Happy New Year, dear fellow gamers! One more gaming year under our belts — and my, what a fruitful and wholesome gaming year that was. Having said that, I'm not going to cover the gaming year as a whole and remind you of what we all know — the Switch et al; instead, I'm going to ramble about my own gaming year, past and to come. Here we go!This was a very busy year as far as my playing was concerned, with more games and runs cleared than ever before. I've had a lot of free time this year as well as a ferocious drive to play games, i.e. the perfect combo; and since things are shaping up to be the same in the next months, you can expect a lot of posts and playthroughs in 2018 as well. The collecting front, on the other hand, has been a bit on the tepid side, with few games bought and a rather sloppy purchasing drive. I'm quite behind on my To-get-my-paws-on list, even neglecting to secure coveted Vita games despite promising myself to purchase such games day one to avoid missing on them. However, I'm confident my purchasing drive will come back before the Vita and 3DS are through; and since I'm not planning on missing on the ultimate releases for these two anyway, there will be a couple more gaming shopping sprees no matter what.And talking about the Vita and 3DS ultimate releases... Eeeh, things are not looking too good on that front right now. The 3DS has a couple of appetizing games slated for release in early 2018, but there are no news of any games being planned beyond that; as for the Vita, 90% of the planned 2018 localizations are digital-only releases. Allow me to be totally unexcited about this, both as a collector worried about the future of the PSN and a buyer who wants the best value for money. That being said, I'd lie if I said I'm over-hyped about the 2018 Vita release schedule: apart from the lone RPG such as Rainbow Skies and Omega Labyrinth Z, there's nothing there that makes me jiggle with excitement. But I'll take what I can, and I'll take it gratefully. 2018 may see the end of both the 3DS and Vita, and I want to bid them farewell with as many game purchases as possible. Bring it on!At that point, it's also safe to say that I will indeed purchase a Switch at some point. There are already a half-dozen games out there I'm coveting and just as many slated for release in 2018, which is more than enough games to justify a purchase — heck, I bought consoles for less games than that back in the days. While I don't think I'll buy the Switch itself in 2018, it's quite possible that I'll start stockpiling games, all the more so if 3DS and Vita releases trickle down to nothing in the second half of 2018. And with that, you have my gaming plans for 2018: lots of playing and blogging, as much collecting as possible and tons of gaming fun overall. I wish you a glorious gaming year, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Six years of gaming happiness: Playing 'em games", "date": "26/12/2017", "text": "The year was 2011, the month was December. Between gorging on cinnamon biscuits and using the short days as an excuse for copious napping, I was eagerly waiting for my sister's imminent visit — and for the Christmas gift she would bring in her luggage. Make yourself comfortable and bring the pop-corn, dear fellow gamers; for what you're about to read is the sweet story of how I reacquainted myself with gaming after nearly fifteen years away from D-pads.Icecap Zone, Sonic 3. Because winter, snow, Christmas.That blissful moment had been a long time coming. Ever since I lost interest in my Mega Drive in 1998 because of a lack of games to play, I had virtually retreated from gaming. I stopped purchasing consoles, stopped following the industry's evolution and generally stopped investing time and energy in all things gaming, pouring instead all my fan instincts and my funds into manga and anime. In 2000, gaming made a timid comeback in my life through emulation, as I discovered the joys of replaying oldies on my newly purchased second-hand PC. However, such bouts of nostalgic gaming were but a mere distraction: I usually indulged in a gaming binge once a year, preferably in summer when free time was abundant, and left my emulators untouched for the rest of the year. This became the pattern for the next fourteen years, up until that fateful year 2011.I don't remember how this happened exactly; but the fact is that by the end of 2011, I had somehow become interested in gaming again, to the point of wanting to get my paws on a current-generation console for the first time in, like, fifteen years. I spent the second half of 2011 comparing consoles and prospecting for potential games; and upon discovering that the Nintendo DS was blessed with a vast array of RPGs, I decided to just go for it and get on board with Ninty again. Enter my beloved sister, a.k.a. my partner-in-gaming ever since we got our first Game Boys together way back in 1990: we plotted that whole thing together and decided that my Christmas 2011 present from her would be a brand-new DS, complete with a copy of Sonic Classic Collection so that I would have something to feed my DS right out of the box.I wanted Christmas gaming pictures, but hey, copyright issues. That awesome Christmas 2011 came to pass, and I felt the joy of laying my hands again on a true blue gaming device at long last. Emulation is all well and nice, but it just cannot compare to the feeling of holding a handheld and knowing that this little machine packs up hours of potential gaming happiness and can deliver said gaming happiness pretty much anytime, anywhere. I was utterly smitten with my gorgeous new DSi and could hardly believe that I owned a console again, after what felt like a million years spent away from gaming.Yet despite being overjoyed at the prospect of diving into gaming again, I didn't quite do that right away. Years spent on an intermittent gaming diet had taken their toll, and I needed to get used to the thing again — all the more so as even back in my active gaming days, I was not the most avid and obsessed gamer of them all. I basically spent the first half of 2012 playing nothing but Sonic Classic Collection and Sonic Rush, with large periods of not touching the DS in between. Then games started trickling in, amongst which cult classics of mine Avalon Code and Dragon Quest IX; and slowly but surely, the DS became a fixture in my life, along with my ever-growing gaming library.But lo and behold, these are from my first DS game. How symbolic!Now, my gaming ways have changed a lot in six years. In the early stages of my gaming rebirth, I used to play each and every game intensely, leaving no stone unturned, no extra dungeon unroamed and no complimentary boss alive. This attitude was born all at once from the desire to recoup my gaming investments, from a sense of duty towards the developers' hard work and, last but not least, from deeply ingrained gaming habits. Games being few and far between in the '90s, I had to squeeze every single ounce of fun out of each and every game I managed to get my paws on. That's how I found myself playing Sonic Triple Trouble on the Game Gear for weeks despite the fact that I hated that game's soundtrack, level design and overall atmosphere; and don't get me started on Super Mario Land, the game that taught me all about making lemonade when life gives me lemons. Coming from that place of scarcity, it should surprise no one that I milked my first DS games dry and kept playing them long after they lost their freshness, despite the fact that I had other games waiting to be played.I've mellowed over time when it comes to game completion, and no longer do I force myself to go platinum with my games no matter what. Life is too short and my collection too humongous to lose time playing games I don't fully enjoy; so when I don't click with a game in the first hours of play or don't feel like toiling on a cheated final boss, I ditch the game entirely and without regret. I've learnt that it's simply impossible to end up loving every single game one buys — especially when one buys games by the truckload — and that one must humbly admit their lack of judgement, sell the offending game and simply move on to the next game in line. I'm also much less of a purist when it comes to game series. There was a time when I insisted on playing a series' entries in chronological order, preferably starting with the very first one when it was possible; however, I don't care anymore nowadays and simply play series in any order I fancy, letting my gaming instinct run the show.That was totally a Christmas post in disguise. And since I'm mentioning this... My sharp, ever-dependable gaming instinct played a huge part in shaping those six years of gaming awesomeness. See, I don't determine my next gaming pick through rational means, such as asking myself which game/series/genre I want to play right now or deciding on a list of games to play in a given timespan; instead, I simply daydream about my collection until I get a sudden and irrepressible desire to play a given game. I don't even have to look at the games themselves: I just let my memories of them flow until I get that sharp, unmistakable impulse to play one of them. The lucky winner can be my newest acquisition, or it can be a game I bought five years before; there's no rule, apart from letting my gaming instinct run the game. (Pun totally intended.) This also means that I have no backlog to speak of: I simply assume that I'll play all the games in my collection sooner or later — that is, if arthritis doesn't catch up with me first. And the most amazing thing is that it works like a charm: the game chosen by my gaming instinct nearly always end up fulfilling my gaming wishes of the moment.There you have it, dear fellow gamers: the story of my Second Coming of gaming, my long-awaited return to the gaming roots I should never have strayed away from in the first place. I'm currently basking in my Halcyon Days of gaming, and let me tell you: this time, gaming is here to stay. I made sure of that, by purchasing enough gaming material and backup systems to maintain my gaming habits for years, if not decades. And since I'm mentioning this, no story of my return to gaming would be complete without covering the collecting side of things as well; and that's exactly what I'm going to do in a future post. Thanks for reading, be my guest anytime and, last but not least: Merry Christmas!"},
{"title": "Atelier Ayesha Plus: I'll be back, baby", "date": "22/12/2017", "text": "Just a quick post to let you know that I've cleared my second run of Ayesha and nailed three of the game's ten-or-so endings. No true ending in sight, but that was to be expected given that I gave Keith the cold shoulder during my whole run. As promised, I sold my whole inventory in the last days and ended up with a massive 200,000 cole balance that's gonna come in handy during my next run. I managed to cram in a bit of gear appraising during the late stages of the game and made my weapons even better, which should make my next runs an even bigger piece of cake than my newly finished run was. I beat most of the complimentary bosses to a pulp, but not all of them, sadly: those bloody Tera Slags got the best of me every single time, and I could hardly scratch that stupid Tank. Guess there's still some room for improvement when it comes to my appraising skills, indeed.Having said that, I can gladly claim that my alchemic skills got a bit better. The learning curse was steep indeed, but we're getting there, thanks to an awful lot of observation and experimentation. I no longer feel completely lost at sea when I'm toiling in front of my cauldron, and I've been able to craft pretty nifty items during my last days in Dusk. I'll probably only get better at it as time and playthroughs go on and enjoy that whole alchemy business more and more. And maybe one day I'll be able to generate those insanely good Traits/Effects/Properties that pop up in forums about complimentary bosses. I only have praise in store for Ayesha, and I have a special soft spot for the land of Dusk. This is simply one of my favourite game worlds ever, and roaming it routinely sent me into heavy-duty bouts of wanderlust. There were times I simply stopped playing to gaze at the scenery, and some of the vistas were so breathtakingly beautiful and evocative that I nearly became teary-eyed just looking at them. Of course, it helps that I'm excessively drawn to mountains as a rule and that Dusk is choke-full with mountainous landscapes; I got some strong Central Asia vibes from that game, mixed with a touch of Tyrol. Dusk feels like a cohesive and organic game world — unlike Arland, which felt more like a collection of disjointed vignettes with little to no consistency. I can only imagine the wonderment of gamers that went from the Arland trilogy to Ayesha and were treated to those breathtaking landscapes thanks to the PS3's horsepower.So, I'm leaving Ayesha for the time being; but I'll certainly reunite with the endearing alchemist and her colourful pals sooner or later. I'll probably also purchase a physical Japanese copy at some point, when my purchasing instincts awaken — they seem to be hibernating for the time being: I haven't purchased a game in weeks. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Atelier Ayesha Plus: Okay, I love it ", "date": "16/12/2017", "text": "No buts and yets this time: I adore that game and I'm having the time of my life playing it. I've been gorging on it for 42 hours straight, and I'm seriously pondering a physical purchase — despite the sky-high prices complete and mint Japanese copies of that game command these days.As it stands, I'm about to polish off my second playthrough; and the very existence of that second playthrough must not be chalked up to my love for Ayesha, but rather to the fact that I suck big time at alchemic RPGs. I spent my first playthrough running around like a chicken with its head cut off, spending way too much time on pointless pursuits and not nearly enough time on the stuff that really matters. I fought, foraged and ran around on the world map too much and synthesized too little, and the consequences were harsh and stinging: I didn't manage to reach the final boss' lair in due time, let alone save my sister. This utter and complete failure stung a bit, to be honest — especially after having read on forums that Ayesha was lenient with time and that clearing everything and getting all endings on the first run was piece of cake. Ouch, my poor gamer's pride.I was not going to stop at that, obviously; I started a New Game + right away and proceeded to streamline my playing. It certainly helped a lot that the game let me keep my overpowered gear, including those awesome items that cut down foraging and travelling time. Those two runs were like night and day, really: this time around, I managed to progress smoothly, synthesize a lot, beat the final boss to a pulp and rescue my sister — and, most importantly, have fun. I'm currently busy tying up a couple of loose ends story-wise and fighting complimentary bosses, and I fully intend to sell my whole inventory right before the end to get funds for my next playthrough. I ran with Linca and Regina during both of my runs, and came to absolutely adore them — so much so that it's going to be really hard to try cruising with other party members. Not that I need to, mind you: I'm in mostly for the atmosphere, the exploration and the fighting, and nothing prevents me from running forever with these two if I want to.But what about alchemy, you may ask? Yeah, what about the meat and potatoes of the Atelier series? Well, about that... It's, erm, complicated. Like, in every sense of the word. I have to admit that I don't really understand the logics of synthesis yet, and that the whole process is too murky, complex and random for comfort. Like, why are Traits, Effects and Properties separate? What's the Stock Yard for, and how come that the Traits I pour into it more often than not don't end up in the final item? Why are Effect descriptions sometimes so impenetrable? Why do I end up with an item with a Water Power Trait when I've been using two ingredients with Wind Power to synthesize it? Why, why, why? I'm lost, I really am. Ayesha is a game that sorely needs detailed tutorials or a replete booklet to explain this whole alchemy business to noobs like me. And yes, I somehow fathom that the very randomness of synthesizing is what makes the whole process interesting; but to enjoy it at all, one must at least master the basics and understand what they're trying to accomplish in the first place. Maybe the original PS3 version came with a massive manual, for all I know; but the digital-only Vita version does not, and that absence really stings.Ah, well; no need complaining about what one cannot change. Not mastering alchemy certainly didn't hamper my fun, nor did it prevent me from finishing the game; so I can live with it, I guess. And who knows, maybe I'll become proficient in alchemy as I play more Atelier games. Because indeed, I'll definitely play more of these: Ayesha has managed the tour de force to make me fall in love with the series in earnest; and after my tepid beginnings with Rorona, that was easier said than done. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Norn9-Var Commons: The Truth Route + Final thoughts", "date": "13/12/2017", "text": "The so-called 'Truth Route' is not so much a true route as an opportunity to tie loose narrative ends and let us know what happens to Sorata, the genius boy with whom this whole mess started. Indeed, he was not forgotten, and neither was his elusive link to Aion, which was hinted at in the prologue. The android and her reborn creator find themselves falling in love with each other à la Chobits, which was an unexpected but quite lovely turn of events. Having the possibility to actively woo Aion instead of simply witnessing the birth of her relationship with Sorata would have made that epilogue even more entertaining; but hey, this is an otome game after all, and I understand Otomate not wanting to push the envelope too far by sneaking in a splurt of gal game action right at the end. As I said before, Norn9 is my favourite otome game so far — and by far. This is the first otome game in which I love every single character and enjoy every single route; on top of that, my favourite routes are in greater number than in any otome I've played before — said routes being Natsuhiko, Senri, Sakuya, Akito and Heishi. I'll definitely replay at least those routes at some point, and most likely all of them: they all have their strengths and share of interesting moments and all bring something to the story and the overall atmosphere. Talking about the story, it's a darn good one. My taste in stories can be described in three words: simple, yet effective — and Norn9's story fits that description to a T. By choosing a simple base concept and dutifully sticking to said concept without trying to expand wildly on it, the writers managed to craft an elegant and striking story devoid of plot holes and paradoxes. Sure, one might argue that Norn9 is a bit light on the narrative side: were all the romantic fluff sheared and the main plot written down, said main plot would definitely amount to a short story rather than a novel — but hey, I'd rather read a terrific short story than a lousy novel.Not only is Norn9 a pretty fine sci-fi story, but it can also be read as a metaphor for the tricky transition between adolescence and adulthood. Teenagers with their unique own special talent are being taken to an unknown place and expected to use said special talent in circumstances that have yet to be clarified, under the authority of yet unknown people: is this not totally a metaphor for joining the workforce and starting living as a self-supporting adult, using your strengths to make a living? Also, the risk of being exploited by the higher-ups and the challenging task of maintaining one's integrity while putting their special talent to good use are mentioned many times, and those are definitely issues anyone has to face on the job. There's no way of knowing if the writers wanted such a metaphor to come across, but it can definitely be read in Norn9's story.And with that, dear fellow gamers, my paean to Norn9 comes to an end. It goes without saying that I totally encourage you to play that gem of a game, whether you're an otome fan or not. (Heck, I sure wouldn't describe myself as such, and yet I lapped up the whole thing from beginning to end.) Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Norn9-Var Commons: The Mikoto Routes", "date": "09/12/2017", "text": "I had a crush on Mikoto the very second I laid my eyes on her. I had a hunch that she was going to be my favourite girl, and she proved me right: her routes totally delighted and enraptured me, and I'm more than glad I kept said routes for the end. (SPOILERS ahead!)Mikoto is a interesting character: she's feisty, proud and dependable with a great sense of responsability, which seemingly makes her the perfect shojo heroine; but she's also hilariously modest, quite clumsy, prone to emotional outbursts, and she often fails to behave like a perfect elegant lady despite her aristocratic upbringing. Yet she does try her hardest to fulfill her duty, and doesn't take any pride in failing to be the consumate lady like any regular anime tomboy would; instead, she just acknowledges her failures, and keeps trying. Watching her act and evolve is incredibly entertaining, and she never ceased to surprise me in her routes. Talking about routes, Mikoto is treated to a great choice of handsome and poised men, along with the most balanced romances: instead of being all about herself like Nanami's routes or all about her beaus like Koharu's, Mikoto's routes pack character development for everybody involved and end up with Mikoto and her potential lover meeting halfway for a fulfilling love story. Note that I said \"lover\", and that's not just a fancy choice of word to avoid repetition: as the only girl who's legal, Mikoto gets to become intimate with her men, which makes her romances even more pleasantly grounded.Itsuki: So we have Mikoto, who's prim-and-proper, very modest and a blue blood; and then we have Itsuki, who's the ship's resident womanizer and a red-light district boy. You might think that this route is gonna be a handful, and you'd be totally right — although it's not nearly as bad as it could have been. These two get on each other's nerves and push each other's buttons constantly, and they get to evolve and mature a lot as a result. Itsuki must face the unpleasant consequences of his careless banter and nonchalant handling of his own feelings, i.e. Mikoto's complete lack of trust and respect for him; he's thus forced to overcome his insecurities and be more forthcoming if he wants to win the lady's heart. As for Mikoto, she's driven into a corner by Itsuki's insightful commentaries and has to face the fact that deep inside, she'd like to let go of her overwhelming duty sometimes and to be the one being protected instead of the one protecting. The two find a common ground over time: Mikoto accepts to lay her head on Itsuki's shoulder and show her vulnerable side to him, and Itsuki become a more sensible man who own his love for Mikoto instead of hiding said love under badinage for fear of being rejected. Natsuhiko: Every Otomate game needs a confinement route, and vagrant engineer Natsuhiko is the one who dons the role of the abductor in Norn9. However, he manages to do so with grace and poise and to not come across as a psychopath or a pervert, which is quite the tour de force. Of course, it helps that he abducts and confines Mikoto not because he nurses some kind of twisted and totally unhealthy love for her, but rather because he wants to use her power to serve his own purpose. She's a mere tool to him, and he has no feeling whatsoever for her; as for Mikoto, she fears and despises him in equal parts. The whole route is about the way they slowly discover each other and fall in love in spite of very unauspicious circumstances; and boy, is it a story well told. Their burgeoning romance is totally believable and deeply fulfilling and heartwarming despite its rocky beginnings, and the whole route made me feel all mushy inside. Cherry on the cake, these two are stunningly gorgeous and ridiculously well-assorted as far as looks are concerned. A special mention to Natsuhiko's short story, which is so impossibly sweet and adorable that I nearly fainted from diabetic coma when reading it. Sakuya: A.k.a. the Childhood Friend — because hey, every otome game needs one. I usually vomit that trope; but Norn9 masters it so well that I lapped it up this time around. Years of knowing each other give Mikoto and Sakuya's relationship a depth and intensity that's absent from all the other routes (bar possibly Akito and Nanami's one, albeit on a smaller scale). They have not been in love since childhood — in fact, it's implied that they only recently fell in love and are still busy figuring out their feelings — but they developed a very complex and intense relationship over the years nonetheless: an intricate mix of protecting each other and feeling dependent on each other in turn, complete with an unspoken deep admiration for each other and a strong desire to better themselves in order to be worthy of the other. Sakuya's seer power is a constant source of torment for both of them: since Sakuya will supposedly die when protecting the girl he loves, they both decided that he should never, ever fall in love. Yet obviously, he falls head over heels in love with Mikoto; and since she desperately loves him back, she cannot suppress her feelings for him despite trying her hardest. Oh, the intensity! It takes a while, but they finally take a chance on their love instead of cowering in fear at the thought of losing each other and brooding over their repressed feelings, and they fight tooth and nail to protect their union. That's it for my favourite Norn9 girl — heck, my favourite otome heroine ever would be closer to the truth. I'll see you soon for an ultimate post about the true route and my final thoughts about the game, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Atelier Ayesha Plus: I like it, yet not quite", "date": "05/12/2017", "text": "I started Atelier Totori Plus a couple of days ago, got unsufferably bored with it, stopped playing it and erased it from my Vita's memory card. I then started Atelier Meruru Plus, got unsufferably bored with it, stopped playing it and erased it from my Vita's memory card. Then, because I'm totally a stubborn masochist that doesn't learn, I started Atelier Ayesha Plus... and fell in love with it on the spot.That sure was a nice and unexpected change. Right from the introduction scene, I was swept away by the beauty of the game world, its sheer scope, its solemn and mysterious atmosphere, its lovely pastel colours, its everything — so much so that I developed yet another full-blown case of gaming fernweh: give me Ayesha's remote hut with its breathtaking vistas and I won't need anything more for the rest of my life. Then the gameplay came in and worked its magic on me, as I became instantly smitten with a bunch of features I'll list down there for your convenience:The new fighting system: More varied that ever, with support moves, effects added to attacks depending on the character and foe's respective positions and the possibility to move around and hit enemies from the back for extra damage, all enhanced by kickass battle animations. Battling was often a dreadful chore in Atelier Rorona Plus, but not so in Ayesha. Plus, we get a brand-new cast of foes to fight: goodbye boring Punis and Rabbits and hello more outlandish and graceful creatures that really look like RPG fauna.The new rules for synthesizing: Gone is the quality system, which made half of your items worthless; now you can keep and use everything you harvest. Gone are also the requirements for specific traits rather than items in recipes, which confused me to no end in Rorona: now you deal with items categories, which is much more simple and straightforward. All this is nicely completed by a new choice of items — I was getting so sick of seeing constantly the same old Eiches and Puniballs in the Arland games, I swear.  The new harvesting mechanics: So much more efficient! Just press the X button when standing on a gathering spot and voilà! Everything is in your basket, and gone is the annoying and time-consuming obligation to review items and select the ones you want to keep/ditch like in the Arland games. Oh, and items stack up in the basket, which means longer harvesting sessions and no worries about the basket getting untimely full. The new 'Memory Point' system: By synthesizing, fighting foes, harvesting, fulfilling quests and talking to everybody in sight, you gain so-called 'memory points' that can be converted into neat benefits such as stat increases, skills and the like. It's a really lovely and darn efficient incentive to explore, roam, poke your nose everywhere and basically do things and get involved in the game world. So there I was, having fun and enjoying the ride; but then, something sneaked in and spoiled my fun. And lo and behold, that something is the exact same thing that cramped my style in Rorona, i.e. the bloody time management. Did I mention that I absolutely loathe time management? I suck hard at it, and having to pull it off in a video game is not my idea of a good time. At all. As a result, my playthrough of Ayesha is slowly losing its shine and charm as my preoccupation with the calendar and its ever-flying days increases. There's not a single action in that game that doesn't consume precious time — heck, I'm sure a day elapses when Ayesha yawns or releases a fart. I have three years to reach my goal, and I have no idea how stringent the game is when it comes to its deadline: do I have a bit of leeway to experiment, or do I have to make every day and every move count? And why isn't there an instant save feature to spare me the hassle of going back to town and losing precious time just to save? On top of the time management hassle, the game's lack of guidance and focus is making me seriously antsy. While Rorona offers the player a series of clear-cut assignments, Ayesha gives you this general goal and lets you figure out by yourself how to reach it. Mind you, I would absolutely lap up that concept in any other circumstances; but given that I must figure things out in a bloody limited time lest I get slapped in the face by a Game Over, I'm finding a teensy bit hard to experiment and get lost in the flow of the gameplay. I have to find a way out of that predicament: either I stop playing the darn game, or I just forget about the deadline and follow my every whim without worrying about the outcome. I'm strongly leaning towards the latter right now: I love the game too much to give it up so soon, and I'll certainly learn plenty of interesting stuff in the process; stuff that can be put to good use in subsequent playthroughs of Ayesha in case I fail my current one — not to mention in the two other Dusk games. I'll mull over the matter and come back at you soon with fresh Ayesha tidings, dear fellow gamers. Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Norn9-Var Commons: The Nanami Routes", "date": "30/11/2017", "text": "Nanami was my second-favourite girl, based on her looks and behaviour in the prologue. An uncanny mix of Akane Tendou and Rei Ayanami, I expected her to pack some narrative punch and treat me to routes more gripping than the Koharu ones. Well, she kinda did — although not quite in the way I expected. (SPOILERS ahead!)Nanami appears as a cool, collected and mysterious character in the other girls' routes; however, once the spotlight shines on her, she turns out to be a deeply insecure individual racked with guilt, self-loathing and a nearly debilitating inability to communicate with others and express her feelings properly. She absolutely hates her power and would like to see it gone, just like her troubled past. Because she's been at her father's beck and call for her whole life, she's mostly unable to make decisions for herself and act as the independant adult woman she's about to become, which leads her to become embroiled in all sorts of sticky situations ranging from crippling to downright dangerous. With such an array of mental hurdles, it makes perfect sense that Nanami's routes should be the most torturous of the bunch by a long shot. (So torturous, in fact, that I unwillingly landed two bad endings.) It also makes perfect sense that she should be the polar opposite of Koharu in terms of route dynamics and focus: Nanami's routes are all about Nanami, with her beau of choice acting as a catalyst for whatever changes she undergoes.Heishi: Ever-smiling and bubbly Heishi treats Nanami to her most romantic and heartwarming route — which, given Nanami's personality, still involves plenty of drama. Heishi and Nanami's relationship is choke-full of all sorts of misunderstandings and uncomfortable moments, all due to the cosmic gap between their respective ways of dealing with their feelings. Heishi is conctantly overflowing with strong emotions he tries to keep in check for his fellow espers' sake; Nanami, on the other hand, has a hard time acknowledging her emotions and an even harder time conveying them to others. The whole route revolves around Nanami slowly discovering that Heishi is in love with her and agonizes over her lack of feedback, after which she tries to come out of her shell and show him that his love is not unrequited after all. They make a really lovely and well-assorted couple, if only because they look so much like each other. Ron: It had to fall upon Nanami to be the dedicated love interest for the game's resident fruitcake/ sociopath/unbalanced douchebag — who also happens to be the traitor everybody hunts. My, such prime romance material! This route is nasty and downright harrowing, with little to no romance or tenderness involved; and yet, it's also one of the most interesting when it comes to Nanami's character development. Ron has a hidden gauge — which I'd dub the 'domination gauge' — that fills up when Nanami behave in a submissive way towards him; his normal affection gauge, on the other hand, fills up when Nanami is assertive and confronts him. This leads to two vastly different outcomes: when the hidden gauge fills up, Nanami winds up in a twisted master-slave love relationship with Ron, obeying him blindly — literally — and doing everything she must to stay with him. When the regular affection gauge fills up, those roles are somehow reversed: Nanami uses her power to wipe out Ron's memory, after which they start a love relationship in which he relies fully on her for daily guidance until he makes new memories. Those two outcomes are perfectly consistent with Nanami's personality and possible evolution: the 'submissive' outcome is but a continuation of her past relationship with her father, while the 'wiped memories' outcome shows her come to terms with her power and use it to bring Ron and herself happiness. Akito: The game's resident delinquent is by far Nanami's most formidable romantic challenge. Due to a sombre event in their past, he absolutely despises her; this only adds to her own self-loathing, and she becomes a complete doormat when Akito is involved, so great is her desire to atone for what she did to him. Of course, one cannot help but feel a thrill of giddy excitement at such a premise: how will these two characters, who have nothing but bad blood between them and bring out the worse out of each other, ever manage to become a happy, lovey-dovey couple? That was a steep challenge for sure; yet the game took up the gauntlet and managed to make the whole thing work — and beautifully at that. Nanami is totally earnest in her desire to expiate her past sins and make Akito feel better in the process, offering to let him hit her and even suggesting that he may kill her if he wishes. Akito is shaken by her sincere remorse and her steely determination to alleviate his suffering, which in turn leads him to see Nanami as a human being rather than a cold-blooded monster. A lot of reassessing of past and present events ensues for both Nanami and Akito, along with the birth of genuine romantic feelings. Nanami gets an unvaluable opportunity to fix what she unraveled back in the days — which translates into a branching path in the game: a certain choice must be made to fully earn Akito's love and secure his Good Ending. This route is the most heart-wrenching of the bunch, but also the most rewarding and fulfilling when one successfully clears it, because it deals with the most painful and entranched obstacle to Nanami's happiness — and Akito's one; and gosh, is it a relief and a joy to see them finally overcome that roadblock together.So, that's Nanami for you: misunderstandings, submission, atonement, self-loathing — the full monty of relationship drama. I certainly didn't expect her to be such a mass of negative emotions and psychological hurdles; but her routes were entertaining nonetheless, and she went through a lot of pleasantly subtle and convincing character development. With that said, I'll see you soon with Mikoto's route report, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Avian Solo Runs: Final thoughts", "date": "26/11/2017", "text": "Here comes the ultimate post about my Avian Solo Run experience; and my, what a remarkable and entertaining ride that was. I came to realize many things during these six playthroughs, which resulted in an heightened appreciation of the Pokemon series and of GameFreak's work as a whole. But first, I must tip my hat to all regional birds: because gosh, are these feathery 'Mons stellar solo run material and great fun to run with. They all performed greatly despite the occasional weakness and shortcoming, and I can only recommend them warmly to any bird lover who wants to indulge in a Pokemon solo run with their species of choice. I'd be hard-pressed to pick up a favourite, because all these birds really rocked; but I have a soft spot for Swellow's design, and my Pidgey run of HeartGold stands out because of how deliciously long it was and how far it took my Trainer and my beloved Pidgey.Playing four generations of Pokemon games in quick succession made me realize how much the series has progressed in the last fifteen years and gave me a better appreciation of the improvements made between generations. The Pokemon series has been routinely blamed for constantly sticking to the same old tired gameplay mechanics and for somewhat betraying its own motto by refusing to evolve; but the truth is that it did evolve, only in a discreet and unobstrusive manner. GameFreak have managed the tour de force of improving consistently on their flagship series while keeping the familiarity of said series entirely intact; that's a tough balance to strike, a balance that many famous videogame series missed completely over time. (For each Pokemon that manages to maintain its initial shine and get subtly better over the years, you have ten Sonic that crash and burn because the developers involved wanted to overhaul everything and follow the latest gaming fashions.) I won't go into all the minute improvements made to balance 'Mons and improve competitive play, because this is really not my area; instead, I'll stick to more mundane details such as the game asking you if you \"want to use another Repel\" from generation V onwards. This looks like nothing, and yet it's the kind of detail that can save you a lot of menu hassle and button-pressing.I have to admit that for all my rambles about my gaming instinct leading the way, I really enjoyed this bout of 'planned' gaming. It was great to have an clear-cut objective for my gaming du jour; so great, in fact, that I'll probably streamline my gaming once in a while from now on. Now, as far as Pokemon solo run features are concerned, this is really only the beginning. Those avian solo runs have opened the floodgates for many similar endeavours, and here's a quick teaser about future solo run features:The Starter Runs: A set of solo runs that feature all Starters from all generations — providing that said Starters are viable for a solo run, that is. I'm definitely not going through the Snivy hassle again. The Eevee Runs: A set of solo runs featuring all eeveelutions. Given Eevee's distribution, these runs would exclusively take place in Black 2/White 2 and X/Y — unless I manage to trade fully evolved Eevees between my own games, that is. The Full Type Coverage Runs: A set of runs featuring all the Types I haven't dabbled in yet, namely Ice, Electric, Ground, Dragon and Fairy. Those runs should provide me with ample amounts of Pokemon action and keep me occupied in the months to come. Here's to a glorious Pokemon solo run rampage to come; stay tuned for all that furry goodness, dear fellow gamers! Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Avian Solo Runs, bonus episode: Noctowl in Pokemon HeartGold", "date": "21/11/2017", "text": "I was initially not planning to tackle a Hoothoot solo run; but as I pored over the bird's specs on Bulbapedia, my interest was piqued. Not only does Hoothoot have an unusual Stat distribution for a regional bird, with high Sp.Attack and Sp.Defense, but it also blissfully strays from the usual Normal and Flying Move diet most regional birds have to put up with as they evolve. Here is a bird that learns a good number of Psychic Moves despite not belonging to that Type; and after my satisfying experiences with male and female Meowstic, I couldn't help but want to wield such Moves again. And so, after running around in the tall grass to no avail for a couple of minutes and finally figuring out that Hoothoot was literally a night owl, I got my paws on a specimen and started cruising Johto once again.What followed was a regular yet satisfying run; Hoothoot is no stellar solo run material, but he gets the job done without a fuss. Most of his Moves are Special Moves: no trolling à la Pidove there, Hoothoot is unshamedly a Special attacker and rocks at it. After a while, my Move pool was pretty much set with Air Slash (Flying), Shadow Ball (Ghost), Extrasensory (Psychic) and Hidden Power: Special Moves only, and powerful ones at that. Most of the roadblocks I encountered when cruising Johto with Pidgey were easy as pie with Hoothoot: Milktank, for instance, was knocked out cold after three turns, and Mahogany's Gym was a mere formality.Sure enough, he ran away.After having cruised with Hoothoot, I still have trouble wrapping my head around that 'Mon: how come he can learn so many Psychic Moves while being Normal/Flying Type? And a Ghost Move? This is the first time I hear about a Normal 'Mon being able to learn a Ghost Move. Not that I complain, mind you: Hoothoot is a very interesting regional bird, on par with Fletchling when it comes to Move pool variety and Type combinations. But that also makes me wonder: why put the regional birds of the three next generations on such a drastic Move diet? Was it for the sake of STAB? Or was Hoothoot originally intended as a regular bird and then recycled as a regional before the game's release? We'll never know for sure, but it's undeniable that Hoothoot is one of the most atypical regional birds to ever roam a region's first Routes. I don't have much to add about that run, really. It was entertaining, and I'm pretty sure I could have taken my little owl all the way to Red; but after having polished off a full HeartGold playthrough mere weeks ago, I was not in the mood to repeat the deed, and so I gave up after I was crowned Champion. At least my Avian Run feature is complete now; and really, it would have been a pity to miss out on Hoothoot given how serviceable that bird is. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Norn9-Var Commons: The Koharu Routes", "date": "16/11/2017", "text": "Koharu was the first heroine I tackled, due to a very mundane reason: she was my least favourite girl, so I wanted to get her routes out of the way first. Before we go any further, here's a disclaimer: I only pursued the Good Endings for all the routes, because a) it's so darn easy thanks to the game's cues and b) I love those characters too much to see them suffer in the throes of bad endings. With that said, let's get to it! (SPOILERS ahead!) Koharu looks like your usual otome heroine at first sight: sweet, innocent, kind and meek, always upbeat and in a good mood despite being lost in a word she doesn't quite understand. Yet her routes reveal a more nuanced and interesting character: a girl that's prone to occasional bouts of brooding and angst and harbours ambivalent feelings towards her power. She's also surprisingly blunt and rather awkward around people, all due to her solitary upbringing. Last but not least, she has a way of blurting out the most embarrassing questions without batting an eyelid, which makes her both endearing and hilarious.Because Koharu is mostly a blank slate in terms of character and personal history, her routes focus essentially on her men's personalities, the hurdles they face and the character development they undergo. That's not to say that Koharu herself doesn't get to be in the spotlight at times; but her evolution is clearly second to her bachelors' evolutions, which are the meat and potatoes of her routes. She gets a nice choice of kind and well-rounded gentlemen, along with straightforward and heartwarming relationships devoid of excessive drama and complications.Kakeru: Being both the natural-born leader of the pack and an unwilling mole under mind control, Kakeru is in a bit of a hard predicament. His upbeat and bold demeanour is but a shiny facade, under which lurk metric tons of self-loathing and angst. His manipulative and slightly sadistic streak is consistently neutralized by Koharu's honesty and innocence, which leads him to regret his actions and try to make amends for them. Basically, Koharu acts as an absolution device for Kakeru: her unwavering support and intense love for the boy allows him to face his deepest fears and insecurities and fully accept them, knowing that Koharu will be there for him afterwards. This route shows Koharu at her most determined, tackling Kakeru's self-destructive behaviours head-on and battling to protect him and preserve their relationship. It's the most intense and serious of Koharu's routes and the one that brings the most to the table in terms of story progression. Senri: As the resident shut-in, Senri goes through a lot of character development. Bathed in Koharu's soothing presence and influence, he learns to become a tad more open to others, to assert himself and stand his ground and to accept his own feelings and emotions instead of trying to ignore them or bottle them in. His growing attraction to Koharu forces him to face his male instincts, which he had not acknowledged until then, and to grow into a full-blown adult despite his tiny frame. This route is the most romantic and heart-warming of the bunch, with an highly emotional Koharu swinging between being flustered and feeling all mushy inside and trying her hardest to convey her love to Senri, who gets gladder to receive said love by the chapter. Masamune: As the crew's self-proclaimed peacemaker and big brother, Masamune has a lot to deal with and very little time for romance. Yet under this diplomat guise hides a healthy young man, whose carnal instincts pop up when he lets his guard down — which, for some reason, happens when he wolfs down sugary stuff. Masamune's personal challenge revolves around making more time for Koharu while simultaneously trying to repress his urges to do the naughtiest things to her, and that's a balancing act he has trouble dealing with for most of the route. As a result, Koharu strays away from him in an attempt to find someone who will see her as valuable and important, which nearly results in a disaster; fortunately, Masamune wake up and smells the coffee before it's too late and manages to bring her back to the fold. This route is the funniest of the three, Masamune and his sugar-induced bouts of lust being an obvious comic relief; but it's also the most angsty and frustrating, with Masamune failing to give Koharu the attention and love she craves until it's nearly too late.In the end, I came to like Koharu and her romances much more than I initially expected. Her routes are refreshingly simple and straighforward, with limited amounts of drama and satisfying endings that leave no ambiguity about Koharu and her beau's deep love for each other. The same thing cannot be said about our next girl's routes — but I'm getting ahead of myself there; more about that very soon, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Avian Solo Runs, Episode 5: Talonflame in Pokemon Y", "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "This is it, dear fellow gamers: the fifth and last instalment of my Avian Solo Run feature. The winged star of this ultimate episode is none other than Fletchling, a bird whose ultimate evolution Talonflame is deemed the most dazzling regional bird ever created by many a Pokefan. And rightly so, shall I say: Talonflame improves so much on the old regional bird formula that he virtually creates a league of its own — a league that, so far, is his turf alone. Sure, older regional birds are good, even great in some cases; but Talonflame is simply outstanding, and its awesomeness is made even more extreme by the fact that it comes right after what is arguably the crappiest regional bird ever created, i.e. Unova's 'my-Stats-don't-match-my-ridiculously-tiny-Move-pool' Pidove. And yet, weirdly enough, it actually turns out that Talonflame is not the best suited regional bird for a solo run. He may be stellar competitive material allright; but when roaming Y as a lone ranger, the fiery bird displayed a number of unexpected foibles — foibles that didn't detract from my run at all, but definitely came as a surprise from a bird that highly rated.I'll cover Talonflame's unexpected shortcomings very soon; but for now, let's focus on his brilliancy and achievements. This is a bird that managed to rise above his regional bird condition, raising the bar for all regional birds to come in the process. These birds, while often great battling material, are usually afflicted with poor defensive Stats, a rather dull Normal/Flying double typing and, last but not least, severely restricted Move pools. Talonflame virtually pulverizes these traditional limitations by boasting more balanced Stats, a more strategically interesting Fire/Flying double typing that he gains by evolving and a deliciously varied Move pool that covers a much wider array of Move Types than his kind usually allows. Over the course of my run, my Talonflame wielded in turn Thief (Dark), Peck, Aerial Ace and Fly (Flying), Ember, Flame Charge and Flamethrower (Fire), Fighting-type Hidden Power and Return (Normal), Solar Beam (Grass), plus a couple of other early Moves I can't be bothered to list here. That's a whole lot of Moves, and that welcome variety made for tons of fun on the battlefield. Cherry on the cake, this is a helluva gorgeous bird, with a lovely middle evolution and a superb final evolution whose splendor is made even greater by the fact that it's constantly airborne when fighting. And talking about being airborne, I could at long last take part in all those Sky Battles that I had to decline constantly when playing X and Y with non-flying 'Mons. You never get too many Trainers to fight, indeed!My Talonflame run was overall a smooth and pleasant run full of glorious one-shooting moments; despite having to resort to Battle Items to escape unscathed from Grant's Rock Gym and final showdown against Champion Diantha, I mostly breezed through the game with a virtually unstoppable Talonflame at my side. And yet, cruising Kalos with the fiery bird actually proved harder than I expected given said fiery bird's track record and overwhelming popularity in the Pokemon community. Talonflame is afflicted with two solo run-unfriendly weaknesses that made him regularly unable to one-shoot opponents, leading him in turn to take hits and sustain copious amounts of damage — to the point that I slapped Leftovers on him just to avoid having to heal him constantly. His first weakness is his (surprisingly) low Attack: with a base Attack of only 81, Talonflame is the second-weakest of all regional birds, standing a mere point above Pidgeot and his 80 base Attack. Such a low base Attack simply couldn't guarantee one-shooting in all battles, even when factoring in overleveling. The fiery bird's second weakness is his lack of Special Move options. Despite the fact that he boasts a base Sp.Attack of 74, which is simply the highest base Sp. Attack of all the final evolutions of regional birds, Talonflame can learn very few Special Moves; and most of the Special Moves he can learn are two-turn Moves that are quite hard to pull off in a solo run. You'd think that given his Stats, GameFreak would have made him a mixed attacker; yet he ends up being mostly a Physical attacker, with the Move pool to match. Talonflame's overreliance on Physical Moves meant that I couldn't pull off my tried-and-tested strategy of using Special Moves to get rid of 'Mons with low Sp.Defense such as Rock and Steel 'Mons, making some battles much harder than they would have been with, say, Pidgeot or Swellow. I fortunately got some much-needed leeway after getting hold of Hidden Power and Flamethrower in the late stages of the game; but having no Special options during most of my run certainly made cruising with Talonflame much harder than it should have been. This was not even something I could circumvent with suitable strategies; the only thing I could do was patiently wear down my opponents while taking damage and heal afterwards. Until the next battle.I could also verify my hunch regarding solo runs being the perfect EV training regimen; and lo and behold, it turned out that I was right. As proven by the picture on the right, my Talonflame maxed out his EV solely through battling every Trainer and wild 'Mon that crossed our path. I didn't keep track of when the maxing-out exactly occurred, but the deed was done by the time I reached Laverre City and was presented with the Effort Ribbon. Now, this fact doesn't really change anything as far as my solo runs are concerned; but it sure fills me with pride to know that I took all my beloved One and Onlies to such lofty grinding heights. One last anecdote for the road: remember that torturous fight against Aegislash in my Skitty run? Well, what do you think happened this time? I one-shot the bloody sword, that's what happened. Oh, and Lucario too. Pokemon solo runs sure can be wildly different depending on your lone 'Mon's Type and Moves! And with that said, dear fellow gamers, this Talonflame run report comes to an end. I'll write an ultimate wrap-up post about these Avian Solo Runs though, so stay tuned for an ultimate bout of feathery goodness! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Norn9-Var Commons: Oops, I'm in love", "date": "03/11/2017", "text": "It's official: Norn9 is my favourite otome game/visual novel so far. I've been glued to that game for a couple of days, gorging on it and gulping down one route after the other in a frenzy. This is a most pleasant development, all the more so as my expectations for that game were initially pretty low. Here's everything Norn9 does right, a.k.a. the reasons it qualifies as a near-perfect game in my book: Story: A true blue huis clos, rife with mystery and drama without being cheap or over-the-top. Here's the pitch: a bunch of youngsters with various powers travel aboard a ship headed towards an unknown destination under the guidance of a mysterious and elusive entity called \"The World\" — and that's really all you need to know, lest we trample on spoiler's territory. The writers were clever enough to stick to their premise and not deviate from it, and there's not a shred of ad hoc or deus ex machina in Norn9's craftily woven narrative. Sure, the story is not perfect: The World's true identity can come across as a trifle underwhelming, and some routes are just plain stingy when it comes to revealing new elements and add painfully little to the overarching narrative mix. Nonetheless, Norn9's story is expertly crafted and manages to be captivating without resorting to cheap plot devices, and that's rare enough in the realm of VN to be mentioned and praised. Characters: I love that crew — heck, if I were 20 years younger, I'd probably have written fanfiction or drawn fanart featuring them. On top of looking absolutely stunning — kudos to Teita for her outstanding work — they also manage to rise above your average anime trope and to come across as genuinely complex and original characters. Take for instance Sorata, the game's red thread: he's your usual genius boy allright, but he's also immature, broody and slightly antisocial instead of being the dedicated helper genius characters usually are (cue Ami Mizuno in Sailor Moon). Or take Koharu: sure, she's meek and sweet like your usual otome heroine, but she's also quite blunt, socially awkward and prone to occasional bouts of anger, all due to her solitary life prior to boarding the ship. Mikoto could have been a prim-and-proper lady or a tomboy; instead, she's neither of these — or a subtle mix of both, depending on how you see it. She has a genuine sense of responsability and tries hard to behave like a lady, yet occasionally fails at it; but instead of moping or wearing her inability to conform like a badge of honour, she does her best to accept her limitations and work around them when possible. The same pattern goes for the rest of the crew: they are all surprisingly complex and much closer to actual humans than your usual impossibly perfect anime characters, and that makes them both endearing and easy to relate to. Presentation: The cream of the crop, really. On top of Teita's amazing character design, we are treated to gorgeous background art full of lovely crystalline colours, making the whole game a delicious eye-candy. The soundtrack is also mesmerizing, completed by very convincing sound effects.Gameplay: This is a VN, so there's obviously not much interactivity to be found there; but the little gameplay offered by Norn9 is perfectly handled. For once thing, having three different heroines to choose from introduces a welcome modicum of variety to the routes on top of allowing for better-matching couples — it always struck me as odd and unrealistic that a single heroine could wind up with vastly different guys in otome games. For another, the game lets you kindly know when a guy's affection is going up, which saves tons of time and allows you to make a beeline for the good ending. Simple and unfussy, and perfect for an otome noob like me. Atmosphere: Norn9's ambience is all at once subdued, contemplative, foreboding, grim, gentle and humourous, switching between all these moods on the fly and mixing them at will. The result is a pretty unique vibe that manages to be both soothing and heart-wrenching, a vibe that left its inprint in me and will definitely linger with me for a while. I can say with absolute certainly that I will replay Norn9 to bask again in its subtle and entrancing atmosphere.Norn9 is a game I wanted to cherish and treasure, a game I want to replay again — and lucky me, I have a physical copy that will allow me to do so at will. Coming soon are full run reports for all three heroines; stay tuned for more Norn9 action, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Avian Solo Runs, Episode 4: Unfezant in Pokemon White 2", "date": "29/10/2017", "text": "Welcome to the fourth chapter of my Avian Solo Run epopee, dear fellow gamers! The feathery 'Mon du jour is none other than Pidove, a bird as mocked, ridiculed and globally considered as crap as Pidgey and Starly are revered and beloved. Pidove is dismissed as a lazy knockoff of one of the most common birds ever known to man, and one must admit that there's a kernel of truth there — a mighty big kernel, mind you: while Pidove's final form Unfezant packs a modicum of personality and originality along with lovely plumage colours and patterns, his original form is, to all intents and purposes, a mere pigeon. A very grey, very realistic, very boring pigeon. Couldn't GameFreak come up with a fancier inspiration for the regional gen V bird than a species that's universally associated with the grime and dirt of big cities? Surely North-America has more local birds to offer, right? How about a Canada goose — or better yet, a bald eagle, the very symbol of the US of A itself? There are not nearly enough birds of prey in Pokemon games, if you ask me. But hey, what's done is done, and we have to make do with what we're given; and that's how I found myself yet again cruising Unova with a pigeon-turned-game bird.While cruising alongside Pidove, I slowly but surely uncovered the real reasons why this bird is so universally vilified by Pokefans, and most especially by online meta aficionados. Those reasons can be summed up in a single, lapidary sentence: Pidove is a complete troll, the crème de la crème of trolly 'Mons. To see the full extent of GameFreak's trolliness when it comes to Pidove&evos, let's lay down the bird's specifics. Unfezant, Pidove's final evolution, has a base Attack Stat of 105 and a base Sp.Attack Stat of 65 — quite the gap, shall we say. This makes Unfezant a perfect Physical attacker; yet half of the Moves Unfezant can learn by leveling up, as well as nearly half of its TM Moves, are Special Moves. But there is worse: Pidove is, so far, the only example I've encountered of a 'Mon that cannot learn offensive Moves belonging to its own Type. I had no idea this was even a thing, and I swear I nearly choked on my own spit when I discovered my Unfezant couldn't learn bloody Sky Drop and Acrobatics. And what a coincidence, those are actually Physical Moves that would have taken perfect advantage of Unfezant's stellar Attack! Such a setting must have been intentional on GameFreak's part; they must have wanted Pidove to not live up to its full potential by severely restricting the bird's access to good Physical Moves, and I can only speculate about their reasons for doing so. My main guess is that they wanted to shake up the online meta my delivering a regional bird that was good for little beyond being a Fly slave. And if that's indeed the case, then they totally succeeded; because while Staraptor was gloriously perched on the heights of the OU tier in gen IV, Unfezant is pitifully nested in the depths of the PU tier, i.e. the absolute bottom of the barrel when it comes to competitive tiers.Mind you, the glaring discrepancy between Pidove's Stats and its potential Move Pool is not its only shortcoming: the poor bird is also a complete regression when it comes to Move variety. GameFreak basically wiped the slate clean with Pidove, taking away all the subtle improvements made in gen III and IV in term of Move pool expansion for bird 'Mons and putting gen V's regional on the worst Move diet I've seen this side of Oricorio. The picture on the right shows the Move pool I used during the latter half of the game, and it fully showcases how utterly desperate I was to get my paws on offensive Moves for my Unfezant. I went as far as to give him an HM, which is something I usually never do in solo runs; and I had no choice but to slap two Special Moves on him just to be make sure I got Moves with high power, high accuracy and a decent amount of PP. (I know he can technically learn Steel Wing and U-Turn; but the former is not a TM in the gen V games, and the former would have been useless before I reached the Pokemon League and got rid of my HM slaves — not to mention that it's a pain to obtain.) And mind you, things would have been even worse if not for the awesome Move Tutor in Driftveil City who taught my Unfezant Uproar — i.e. one of the most amazing Normal Moves I've ever had the honour of handling. Uproar is basically a three for one discount, with each PP delivering three turns of intense action — perfect for restroom breaks. On top of that, it's a Special Normal Move, which is a configuration rare enough to deserve a bit of notice and praise — despite the fact that said configuration was not the best suited for my run. Uproar was a breath of fresh air by sheer virtue of being a Move I never used before, and its use was basically a bet every time: I could never be sure the next 'Mon in line wouldn't be resistant or immune to Normal Moves, and it made the use of Uproar widly entertaining. The weird thing is that despite Pidove's huge limitations, cruising Unova with him was actually kind of a breeze. He was more than able to hold its own on the battlefield right from the beginning; and from the halfway point, he actually became overleveled enough to one-shoot opponents with Special Moves Air Slash and Uproar. Having these Special Moves was actually an ace in the hole all things considered, because it allowed me to reprise the strategy I used in my Pidgey solo run and dispose neatly of Rock and Steel 'Mons, and more generally of all 'Mons with a less-than-stellar Sp.Defense. That's the weirdest thing ever, really: for all intents and purpose, Pidove&evos is a crappy 'Mon and the shittiest regional bird ever created, and yet he is perfectly decent solo run material in practice. I'd be tempted to attribute this unlikely performance to Black&White 2 being shamelessly easy, if not for the fact that my Snivy solo run of Black 2 was far from being a cakewalk. How my Pidove-turned-Unfezant managed to perform so amazingly well despite his obvious limitations is quite a mystery to me, and I'll just chalk it up to a perfect combination of overleveling, fitting Moves and sheer luck.With that fourth Avian Run under my belt, this feature is slowly but surely coming to an end, with just one more feathery solo run to tackle. I'll see you soon with the run that wraps it all up, dear fellow gamers; and I sure hope it will be the most glorious closure of them all. Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Ray Gigant: Not quite a dungeon crawler", "date": "23/10/2017", "text": "I have to face the harsh truth: I've been playing Ray Gigant for 10 hours and I don't quite enjoy it.I didn't want to believe it at first, you know. I mean, we're talking about a first-person dungeon crawler, i.e. one of my favourite subgenres under the RPG sun and one I'm not too picky about, given how much I enjoyed mediocre offerings such as Class of Heroes and Moe Chronicles; so how come I disliked Ray Gigant? I thought about it a little bit, and it suddenly struck me that Ray Gigant was not really a first-person dungeon crawler after all. Or, to be more precise, Ray Gigant looks and plays like a FPDC to some extent, yet it lacks all the trappings of the genre I've come to know and love. Here are the game's most glaring shortcomings, which are also my main beefs with it:Easy in all the wrong places: Ray Gigant replenishes your team's health after each and every battle and lets you exit dungeons at any time, which is all well and nice; but I would have preferred an instant save option along with the possibility to heal outside of battle, thank you very much. Likewise, each dungeon features a single save point that also automatically reveals the whole map of said dungeon; but as a dungeon crawler aficionado, I feel totally robbed by that feature. Half of the fun in FPDC comes from maniacally exploring every nook and cranny of a dungeon and seeing the map filling up as you do so, and I don't fancy seeing a game take that simple pleasure away from me.Too much story: Ray Gigant is a game that has a story to tell and really wants to tell it. In practice, this means that crawling is constantly interrupted by cutscenes bristling with dialogues. Maybe the story is fascinating for all I know — and I don't know that much, given that I stopped paying attention to cutscenes very quickly — but I don't play FPDC for their stories. In fact, I deem stories in dungeon crawlers detrimental to my fun, because constant narrative interruptions prevent me from becoming engrossed in the flow of the crawling. Also, the darn game is so hell-bent on telling its darn story that it doesn't allow diversions such as side quests. How rude!Too linear and constrictive: I don't mind a bit of linearity in my dungeon crawling, as my intense love for 7th Dragon III abundantly proves; but Ray Gigant goes way too far in that department. For one thing, dungeons are, to quote Doc Brown in Back to the Future, erased from existence as soon as you polish them off. How dare you, game? I painstakingly explored these dungeons and it's my absolute right to be able to keep visiting them at leisure, dang it! For another, levels are capped, which forces you to resort to strategy rather than brute force in boss fights and makes level-grinding entirely pointless once you've maxed out your team's level. Now, I don't mind strategizing once in a while, but why can't I also level-grind if I want to? I'd rather have hardcore difficulty along with the possibility to level-grind rather than a reasonably easy game thats coerces me into a single course of action. It's all about freedom and playing it my way, and Ray Gigant won't allow me to do that — and I despise it for its interfering ways, ooh yes I do.Too simplistic: No substantial loot. No shops. No real equipment management. No crafting system to enhance said equipment. No items. No side quests, not even Fedex ones. Palette swaps up the wazoo. Tiny and empty dungeons. Enemy placement that never varies. There's a fine line between simple and barren, and Ray Gigant definitely crosses it — more like leaps over it, really.   That being said, not all is doom and gloom: I've been playing Ray Gigant for 10 hours, so it obviously has a couple of redeeming qualities. Roaming dungeons — when the game lets me do so — is delightful, the difficulty curve is well implemented and I really liked starting over with a new party once I was done with my first team. The final boss fight for Ichiya&co was also a neat and thrilling challenge: you have to balance parasitism, AP and SBM while hitting the boss and making sure everybody stays alive, and it was great fun. But alas, those good points are not enough to make me want to keep playing Ray Gigant. The last straw was when Kyle&co got stupidly wiped out in a stupid encounter after half an hour of intense crawling and fighting, which pissed me off so much that I erased my save file. I'm thus done with Ray Gigant for the time being, and maybe forever: because let's be honest, this game doesn't deliver at all on the dungeon crawling front. It's more akin to a visual novel with bouts of first-person dungeon crawling squeezed between events, and that's not how I want my dungeon crawlers to feel and play. What I want is freedom, huge dungeons choke-full of hazards and loot by the truckload; and if I cannot get all that in Ray Gigant, then I'll get it in other games. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Touhou Genso Wanderer: Lovely little roguelike", "date": "18/10/2017", "text": "Touhou Genso Wanderer for the Vita is a strange beast. It's ridiculously expensive, has no physical release even in Japan and is, if the total absence of walkthroughs on the internet is any indication, played by virtually no one. PS4 owners were graced with a physical release of that game while Vita owners were completely ignored and had to make do with a digital-only version, which makes absolutely no sense given that the Vita is the abode of niche gaming. On top of that, it's a clunky Shiren the Wanderer clone with a pregnant low-fi, budget feel, which makes its overinflated price tag all the more ludicrous. And yet, I craved that game and wanted it in my collection; my gaming instinct told me I would have a blast playing TGW, and a blast I had indeed.  Just like Shiren, TGW features a really short main story dungeon followed by some enormous post-game dungeons, the former feeling like a mere appetizer for the latter. Not for me, though: once I was done polishing off the 38 floors of the main story dungeon, I was more than content to turn off my Vita and call it a day. I wanted to indulge in a short, sweet and reasonably challenging bout of rogueliking, and that's exactly what I got with TGW. That game lounges at the easy end of the Roguelike spectrum and is much more forgiving than games like Shiren or Sorcery Saga. For instance, TGW doesn't send you back to the very beginning of the game empty-handed when you perish: you keep all your items, the only thing lost forever being your money. Traps are seldom — if ever — deadly and often fail to trigger, the item that lets you return to base is abundant and foes' behaviour is easily predictable. Since TGW offers no cheated items such as Shiren's Mamel Meat to take care of powerful foes, main character Reimu has to be genuinely strong to survive the last floors of the main dungeon and the last boss. That mandatory strength is obtained primarily through leveling up gear and adding useful seals to it, and to a (much) lesser extent by leveling up Reimu herself. The sense of progression is much more palpable than in Shiren, as you find yourself able to go a bit further with every bout of equipment buffing-up. That makes TGW the perfect game for short bouts of rogueliking: with a bit of toiling, luck and clever gear management, you're guaranteed to see the credits roll in 15 hours or less. The game is full of lovely little surprises, such as a sakura flower dungeon, scrumptious-looking Japanese food items and pieces of gear that change form as they level up or get fused with other pieces of gear. Like, look at my awesome ghost sword and crystal shield in the picture above! They didn't look like that at first, and I nearly squealed with delight when they transformed under my very eyes. Little moments like this alone make the game worth playing as far as I'm concerned.That being said, TGW is still a totally overpriced game that lacks ergonomy and is mostly derivative. I'd like to recommend it to beginners because of its shortness, if not for the fact that there are nearly no tutorials and that the menu sytem is really clunky and confusing, not to mention the rules of the game itself. Sorcery Saga is a much better deal for a beginner: it's more accessible, has a more distinctive atmosphere and can be found boxed for one-fourth of TGW's price. But despite TGW's shortcomings, I really loved it and could perfectly imagine myself replaying it. If only Limited Run could release a boxed version of that game, I'd be a very happy roguelike aficionado indeed. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Avian Solo Runs, Episode 3: Staraptor in Pokemon Platinum", "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "Welcome to the third episode of my Avian Solo Runs feature, dear fellows gamers! Here we are, back to the generation that started it all for me; and boy, was it delectable to go back to my Pokemon roots. On top of being treated to sweet waves of nostalgia (kinda ironic knowing that I played the gen IV games only a mere three years ago), I got to appreciate much more how splendid a game Platinum is. Exquisite graphics, perfect pacing, lovely atmosphere, that game has it all and improves on Diamond and Pearl on all fronts. Sure, Sinnoh still could be a trifle more varied and offer more types of landscape, and the design of local 'Mons could still be a tad more inspired; but overall, Platinum is such a fulfilling game that I'm not sure I can ever go back to Diamond and Pearl and their crudeness. And since I'm mentioning all three games in the same sentence, there's one thing that bugs me: why are these games' names so inconsistent? We have a gemstone, an animal by-product and a metal, all things that are seemingly unrelated. According to the prevailing version logic, Pokemon Crystal should be titled Platinum, while Platinum itself should be titled something else entirely, just like Diamond and Pearl themselves. What's the logic behind this triad of names? Are they related to jewelry somehow? Or did GameFreak run out of inspiration at the time? These incohesive names don't diminish the games' merits in any way, mind you; but they sure are puzzling, all the more so are they are the only true case of nominal incoherency in the whole series. Ramblings about versions and names aside, the regional bird du jour is none other than online meta darling and OU tier permanent resident Starly. This is no mere Fly slave we have here, oh nooo: Starly is, as one Jubilife TV anchor neatly put it, a \"mighty fine\" 'Mon, blessed with such impossibly high Attack and Speed that it might as well have been tailor-made for solo runs. With that tuxedo bird, GameFreak kept slowly but surely expanding the Move pool of their regional avian 'Mons: the Starly family has access to more Move Types than the Taillow family, which itself was an visible improvement on the Pidgey family on the Move pool front. Granted, the stinginess inherent to older entries when it comes to handing out Moves prevented me from gaining access to a genuinely wide Move pool; nonetheless, I managed to put together a pool of Moves belonging to four different Types over the course of my run, and that's the first time this happens since I started tackling the Avian Runs. On top of never-missing Aerial Ace and solo run little darling Return, my Starly expertly wielded Steel Wing, the Steel Move that had proved so refreshing and useful in my Taillow Run of Emerald, as well as newcomer Close Combat, a Fighting move with few PP yet great potential. That Move involved some lowering of the user's Defense and Sp. Defense Stats, yet packed an insane 120 power, which made it the perfect finishing Move to take down a buff Legendary or a Gym Leader's overpowered ultimate 'Mon. I used it regularly to wrap up tough engagements in a neat and orderly fashion, knowing fully that the defensive Stats reduction would have virtually no effect.Mind you, my Starly solo run would have unfolded just as fine without Close Combat: the tuxedo bird is so insanely powerful that I encountered virtually no obstructions over the course of my run. With Platinum having a Rock Gym as its very first Gym just like Emerald, I fully expected to struggle as much as I did in my Taillow run; yet low and behold, Starly's Attack is so impossibly high that I managed to take down Roark's collection of rocky roadbloacks without too much damage nor fainting. I didn't use a single Battle Item over the course of my run, and the Elite Four was a complete walk in the park. I mean, what could a Bug Trainer and a Ground Trainer possibly do against a Flying 'Mon that's immune to Ground Moves and wields a kick-ass Flying Move? Starly&evos is stellar solo run material, a 'Mon utterly perfect on all fronts. Or nearly all fronts: in my opinion, GameFreak somewhat dropped the ball when it comes to Staraptor's design. Starly's final evolution looks a bit off, with a head that's too small compared to its body size, feather tufts that look like cat ears and eyes that are disturbingly tiny and devoid of expression. The worst part is that GameFreak actually changed the Staraptor sprite for Platinum, making the poor bird visibly uglier in the process; his Diamond/Pearl sprite looked much better, with a more natural stance and a sharper eye. Had I known about this sprite change beforehand, I swear I would have picked Diamond or Pearl for my Starly run despite the fact that Platinum is the superior game.All in all, the Starly family amply deserves its fame and permanent spot in the OU tier. That bird is much more versatile than his gen II and III predecessors thanks to his more varied Move Pool, and ends up being much more entertaining and pleasant to use, especially in a solo run. My Starly solo run was overall an incredibly smooth, mellow and soothing ride — much like Sinnoh and the gen IV games themselves, really. And with that run under my belt, I now have only two avian runs left before I achieve full Regional Bird coverage. See you soon for more thrilling feathery action, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Rainbow Moon: That's a wrap", "date": "04/10/2017", "text": "Roughly one year after I took a break from my beloved Rainbow Moon, I went back to it and polished it off in one clean, swift go. I defeated my archenemy in a fight that was mostly a matter of patience over tactics, said archenemy being a massive HP bag whose blows hardly made a dent on my little Baldren's enormous HP bar. I could then at long last go back to my homeland, only to be kindly invited to go back to Rainbow Moon — the land, not the game — to tackle a flurry of sidequests involving massively overlevelled enemies. I passed on that, though: after 75 hours spent playing Rainbow Moon, I definitely had my fill of grinding, drawn-out battles and quests sending me all over the world to pick random items. More of this would spoil the pleasure, and I certainly don't want to ruin the memory of those amazing and fulfilling 75 hours of roaming, exploring and grinding. I used to think that I would play that game for hundred of hours, taking my sweet time and enjoying the ride; but then the credits rolled and, well... You know the drill: my drive to play plummeted and crashed down, never to rise again.To wrap up that Rainbow Moon epic, I'll make a quick, non-exhaustive list of the things I loved in that amazing gem of a game. I was initially (read: last year, when my obsession with the game was at its peak) planning to write an exhaustive list of said things I loved; but now, one year later, I don't really feel like doing that — not to mention that it would probably be an exhausting (no pun intended) read. So I'll just stick to the features that really stick out (sheesh, enough crappy puns already):All randoms encounters can be avoided, fleeing never fails and the game lets you kindly know which foes you'll be fighting and how many of them. Perfect for micromanaging your level-grinding and your farming.Should you die in battle, you'll respawn at the exact same spot with 1 HP. No progression lost, no backtracking, no hassle. Healers, merchants and the like can be found virtually everywhere, including in the deepest recesses of dungeons. Exploring those cutthroat places suddenly feels much more relaxing once you know you can rest and refurbish on the spot.Instant save anytime, anywhere. 'Nuff said. You always get the opportunity to save and prepare before boss battles, even after you've engaged with said boss. This is the RPG equivalent of anime foes politely waiting for heroes to have achieved their transformations and delivered their introductory speeches before attacking them, and it's both hilarious and very handy.Tons and tons of loot ready for the taking. On top of the obligatory monster drops, the game world is overflowing with safes and money bags begging to be pilfered. Oh, and they glow. With a golden shimmer. You'll feel like Scrooge McDuck when you see them, I swear. Then you have more subjective points, such as the lush graphics that caress and soothe the retina, the pint-sized game world that does away with useless roaming (always a plus for a gamer who grew up on 8 and 16-bits offerings), the whole enchanting atmosphere of the game that reminds me of RPGs of old and fills me with nostalgia and wanderlust, the tight gameplay that features metric tons of grinding, and so on. I just ADORE that game, period. It's a perfect retro grindy treat with a heavy coating of modern player-friendliness, and this is a mix I'll undoubtedly come back to in the future. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Avian Solo Runs, Episode 2: Swellow in Pokemon Emerald", "date": "28/09/2017", "text": "Welcome again, dear fellow gamers, for the second instalment of my Avian Solo Run feature! Our lone flyier this time is Taillow, a bird that can be described as the polar opposite of Pidgey: not only does it don a sleek, aerodynamic frame and cold-toned plumage where Pidgey was all ruffled feathers and warm shades, but it's also as gloriously unknown and ignored by fans as Pidgey is recognized and celebrated. As a matter of fact, I don't remember having encountered any mention or even picture of Taillow anywhere before playing Emerald. Sure, it's the regional bird of Hoenn, so it makes sense that it won't be seen anywhere beyond the region's frontiers; but heck, I sure knew about Pidgeot before playing the generation I and II games. Taillow, on the other hand, is hardly ever featured in fan art, is never mentioned again after generation III and certainly didn't benefit from a cool update in later generations such as a flashy Mega-Evolution. Is it because of its sober looks? Is it because it has only two stages of evolution? Is it because it looks way to much like its real-life inspiration? Is it because its final form looks ridiculously smug? Whatever the reason, I find this lack of fame mostly unwarranted given how amazingly that lithe bird performed in my Emerald solo run.As you obviously noticed already, I went for the original Emerald rather than for the ORAS remakes. There were two reasons for that: first, I prefered the Taillow and Swellow sprites from the generation III games; and secondly, I wanted to experience said generation III as it was originally meant to be before diving full force into the remakes. I've only been dabbling briefly in Alpha Sapphire a couple of years ago, but gave up quickly on my playthrough for fear of spoiling my experience with Emerald. It seemed more logical and righter to play the original before the remakes, although I sure let a lot of time pass before finally tackling that Emerald playthrough. But better late than never, as they say; I now have a run of Emerald under my belt, and my, what a fine run it was. I know that the gen III games were the black sheep of the series for the longest time (until the gen V games snatched that dubious honour away from them); but that sure wasn't due to their pacing, storyline or to the Hoenn region in itself, because all these aspects are quite stellar. I found myself embroiled in a delirious and hectic adventure, rushing from mountain tops to ocean floors through what can only be described as one of the most varied and interesting Pokemon region ever created; I faced two incredibly touching and riveting Pokemon rivals and found myself squeezed between two vilain teams at loggerheads with each other; I got to meet and fight my dad for the first time ever in a Pokemon game and I Surfed so much I could hear the Beach Boys in the background, and I enjoyed the whole ride tremendously.I also enjoyed Taillow quite a lot. Despite its lack of fame, this is a stellar bird 'Mon that can do a stellar job on the battlefield with enough training and dedication. Sure, we were off to an incredibly rough start, with the very first Gym being choke-full with Rock 'Mons. This was a serious roadblock that I managed to overcome only with an awful amount of preparations. First thing first, I level-grinded until my beloved Taillow reached lv.20, knowing fully well that this alone wouldn't do the trick; Taillow's main strength is his sky-high Speed Stat, but the bird is not especially stellar on the Attack front. So I made good use of a particularity of Emerald, i.e. the presence of Battle Items in Rustboro's shop — which, en passant, seriously challenges the notion that Pokemon entries only got easier with time. I bought all the X-Atk and X-Defend I could with my meagre funds, which didn't amount to much at that early point in the game; but I needed the edge they would provide to make my Gym strategy work. Said strategy involved stuffing my Taillow with Battle Items at the very beginning of the fight and spamming Double Team until the game told me it had no effect anymore in order to reduce damage; then, I would unleash my Taillow's not-so-destructive blows while praying for Double Team to work its magic and keeping an eye on the health gauge. This was a bit of an ordeal, but it worked finely in the end, and it gave me the (too) rare opportunity to strategize a Gym showdown from beginning to end.After that mother of all Typing roadblocks, I pretty much spent the whole game one-shooting everything that moved. Sure, the Electric Gym that followed stung a bit (no pun intended), but it was still easy-peasy compared to its Rock counterpart. Over the course of my run, I put together a nifty Move roster made of normal moves Return (a beloved classic!) and Double-Edge (a move quite handy to wipe out 'Mons my Taillow was weak to before they could move a toe, knowing that being hit by said 'Mons would hurt more than the damage dealt by Double-Edge itself), flying move Aerial Ace (a bit weak on the long run, but never missing its aim) and steel move Steel Wing (a welcome breath of fresh Typing air despite its unperfect accuracy). I'm quite glad I got to use a different Move set and thus different strategies than in my Pidgey solo run, despite the fact that both Taillow and Pidgey are Normal/Flying 'Mons with tons of Moves in common; I was fearing that my Avian Runs would all play the same, but reality is proving otherwise — and much more interesting. I was also fearing that the lack of Physical/Special split for move would hamper my Taillow's performances, but I noticed virtually not difference on that front compared with newer entries. Guess these aging mechanics were really crippling only for a couple of unlucky 'Mons, such as Dark-Type Absol and his Stats that were often at odds with his Moves' assigned damage category.In a nutshell, I loved everything about my Taillow Solo run, from the distinct GBA graphical touch to the swift pacing, without forgetting my gorgeous Taillow-turned-Swellow himself. But wait, you may ask, what did you think about Emerald's and Hoenn's most enduring legacy, the one that ultimately gave birth to the infamous \"Too much water\" meme? Well, I'll be blunt: I absolutely adored Emerald's overwhelming aquatic terrain. I loved the Surfing and the Diving to pieces, the latter even making shivers run up and down my spine: I used to be terrified of depths when I was a kid and that fear lingers still a bit in me, and my inner bathophobic found Emerald's representation of deep seabeds pretty convincing. That being said, I have a gripe about the water Routes featured in the second half of the game, i.e. 124 to 130; and that gripe is how wide and confusing they are overall. I got repeatedly lost on these Routes and it took me way more time than necessary to reach my goals, be they above or under water. That's pretty much a pet peeve, but I sure hope that the 3DS remakes improved on that aspect and made the maritime routes easier to navigate — no pun intended.With that said, dear fellow gamers, I'll see you again for the third episode of my Avian Solo Runs feature, which also marks the halfway point of this whole ride. With that third episode, I'm going to dive back into the games that started it all for me as far as my love for Pokemon is concerned; games that, coincidently, I haven't played for the longest time. Hopefully the reunion will be fulfilling and heart-warming! Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Fairune: Cute but flawed", "date": "23/09/2017", "text": "Indie games and I are not a good match overall; so when I stumble on an indie game I like, which happens one in a blue moon, I try to milk the darn thing as much as I can. That's why I've been polishing off three runs of Fairune, a cute little indie game that's an unashamed homage to 8-bit action RPG. Fairune is basically Hydlide sprinkled with a bit of Ys and Legend of Zelda: it boasts graphics that scream 8-bit, a really catchy chiptune soundtrack that has a way of getting stuck in one's head and a basic yet relaxing and satisfying gameplay based on puzzle-solving and enemy-stomping — complete with a very unexpected bout of space-shooting during the final boss fight. I had lots of fun playing that simple little retro treat, and yet... I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone; because as cute and refreshing as it is, it's also quite flawed — and we're talking about a game-breaking flaw here, not a mere cosmetic issue.If you write off Fairune's shortness, simplistic graphics and barebone gameplay as aesthetics choices that must be loved or left, the game's single major flaw is the inconsistency of its logic. Solving Fairune's endless string of puzzles is a cinch most of the time, especially when one figures out said puzzles' patterns; yet once in a while, the game throws in a puzzle that boasts confusing and/or never used before logic or even downright makes no sense at all unless the player knows exactly what they're supposed to do. Here are the three insults to logic that irritated me the most:The Warrior Statue: This is an item that you obtain early on and that's used many times over the course of the game; however, figuring out how to use it can be tricky at first, because its design is kinda counter-intuitive. As the name suggests, this is a statue of the game's heroine; and as the shape suggests not, it must be used as a mere weight to hold down switches and the like. Why not go with something a bit more obvious and straightforward, like a stone or a brick? By all RPG logic, a statue should rather be used as a key of sorts to open a locked door, not as a mere dead weight. Were you trying to be fancy or just confusing, game? I'm so not impressed.The Infinite Warp: An homage to 8-bit RPG wouldn't be complete without a good ol' screen that warps lest you choose the right set of directions. Fairune's warping screen can be found in the Administrator Tower; and as you may expect, there's a clue nearby to help you figure out the right directions, and that clue is none other than six statues conveniently facing the directions you're supposed to take. But wait, there's a catch: those statues only indicate the directions you have to take, not the order in which you're supposed to take them. Are you kidding me, game? Do you know how many options that leaves? If you assume that the last direction has to be left for layout reasons, that leaves 120 different combinations! I assure you I have better things to do than test 120 bloody permutations just to cross a screen, game. Such a cumbersome puzzle is entirely pointless, especially in the age of the internet. But wait, there's worse...The Mamono Slayer: This puzzle is the worst offender of the bunch, because there is virtually nothing that indicates that it must be tackled or even that it exists at all. The Mamono Slayer is a sword that's necessary to slay the final boss; and how do you get that sword you're never told about? Why, by upgrading your regular sword in a hardly discernible split on the first floor of the Administrator Tower, of course! Seriously, game? Why can't I have a single functional clue to figure out what I'm supposed to do? Do you maybe expect me to try every single item on every single pixel until I hypothetically stumble upon the solution? This is pure obnoxiousness, that's what it is. There is nothing worse that a random puzzle that cannot be solved through logic just because you don't even know it's there. I honestly can't figure out why these shitty puzzles were allowed to soil Fairune. Was it a vibrant homage to the fake difficulty-riddled '80s adventure games? Was is an attempt to make the game last longer than the mere hour it takes to beat it once you know the ropes? Were the puzzles created by two different teams? Whatever the reason, that uneven logic serves no purpose and only detracts from the game's quality by forcing the player to run to a walkthrough on a regular basis.Anyway, that's one less indie on my to-play list. I've been able to cross a couple more lately, including the two Hotline Miami games and Titan Souls: those three games combine a gameplay requiring diabolical precision with a sloppy and unprecise set of controls, and that's a deadly combo that made me scurry away faster than I could scream \"shit, a game that requires motor skills!\". So all in all, Fairune is the best indie I've played these last months despite its game-breaking flaw; and that, dear fellow gamers, is a testament to how indie games and me are not meant to cross paths. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Avian Solo Runs, Episode 1: Pidgeot in Pokemon HeartGold", "date": "17/09/2017", "text": "Welcome, dear fellow gamers, for the first episode of my Avian Solo Runs feature! We're dealing with star material here, since our lone ranger du jour is none other than Pidgey, an absolute fan favourite and one of the most ubiquitous 'Mons of the first two generations. Did that famous opener live up to his reputation? Well, we'll see that very soon.I cruised Johto and revamped Kanto on my DS, since I don't own the original games; and things will probably remain that way since these games are notorious for being unplayable these days lest one regularly replaces their batteries. Fun fact: my copies of HeartGold and SoulSilver, which are boxed and mint and which I snatched for a very fair price back in the days, are Canadian ones. More specifically, french Canadian ones, which sport only the language of love and are uncompatible with english copies. Now, this honestly boggles my mind: why release an exclusive french version in a country with two official languages? Was it a Québec exclusive? Anyway, this messed up with my Poke-references quite a fair bit — just think of all the translation work I had to go through just to be able to deliver that post — but owning the games in perfect condition was definitely worth the hassle.This time around, I polished off Kanto right after Johto, taking my Pidgey-turned-Pidgeot all the way to the summit where Red was lounging around, seemingly staring at nothing with snow piling up around his ankles (Spoiler: Pidgeot wiped the floor with him and his 'Mons). And boy, what an epic, mindblowing and fulfilling run that was! It was all at once deliciously grindy, heart-warmingly cosy and brimming with thrilling exploration and roaming, and I loved every minute of the 22 hours I spent cruising the original two Pokemon regions. Well, nearly every minute: I could have done without the 100.000 times my Pidgey was paralyzed by Electric 'Mons (could it be due to her weakness to that particular Type?), without Whitney's bloody sturdy Milktank (good thing my Pidgey was female, or things would have been even worse because of Milktank's Attraction) and without Lt. Surge's ridiculously annoying Magneton, which I needed to postpone over and over to be able to beat it (Pidgey towered literally 45 levels over it when she took it down yet still struggled to do so).The rest, however, was a cakewalk; and the fact that I even managed to reach Red at all despite my Pigdeot's occasional lack of punch — the poor thing has a base Attack of only 80, which is even lower than Liepard — was in no small part due to smart Move management. Flying 'Mons have very few weaknesses to start with, and most of the work consisted in working around these weaknesses. I unfortunately didn't manage to alleviate issues with Electric 'Mons, and they remained a thorn in my side until the very end. Rock 'Mons, on the other hand, were easy to dispose of thanks to an ingenious hack: I reprised the trick of wielding one Special Move and one Physical Move of the same Type — in that case Air Slash and Wing Attack respectively — to target each foe's defensive weaknesses. It turns out that Rock 'Mons often have shitty Sp. Defense, which allowed my Pidgey to dispose of them without breaking a sweat thanks to the combination of Air Slash, decent Sp.Attack and overleveling. I had an Electric-typed Hidden Power that allowed me to take care confortably of the many Water 'Mons littering Johto and Kanto, and Quick Attack retained its power for so long that I hold unto it until the late stages of the game before replacing it with my beloved Return, a.k.a. the Perfect Solo Run Move. As for my Pidgey's last glaring weakness, i.e. Ice 'Mons, they were so few and far between that dealing with them was hardly a hassle. I only had to delay Mahogany Town's Gym until my Pidgey was overleveled enough to take down Pryce's Pilowswine without passing out in the process.This leads me to one of HeartGold's highlights, namely its non-linearity. I had written off this feature as crappy old-school game design during my first run of the game, but I realize now that this enthusing opening of the game world after Ecruteak City was entirely intentional on GameFreak's part. And boy, is it a thrill to get to explore the wilderness at your own pace and tackle the three next Gyms in the order you want! As it turned out, I started with Mahogany's Gym, failed to clear it and then followed the more traditional order of Cianwood and Olivine before returning to Mahogany with a vengeance and a good number of extra levels under my belt. Kanto was even better, allowing me to roam around as though I owned the place. I kinda did, in a way; despite having played through the first generation only once, I remembered nearly all locations. Now that I can appreciate better non-linearity and roving in Pokemon games, maybe I'll replay Generation I entries with a more open mind at some point. Hey, I own a copy of Yellow that is just begging to be played before its batteries die on me.You get the picture, dear fellow gamers: this first official Avian Solo Run was a total and complete blast. It was thrilling, uplifting, heartwarming and a delightful adventure from beginning to end. Never before did I undertake 16 Gyms, a whole Pokemon League (twice) and a legendary Champion with a single 'Mon, and this exploit created the most enduring and amazing bond between me and my beloved Pidgey. This most breathtaking run also gives me good hopes for the following Avian Runs; although I already suspected that bird 'Mons were stellar solo run material, successfully tackling two regions and a regiment of Gyms Leaders with a single bird really drives the point home in the most flamboyant way. See you soon for my next Avian Solo Run, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Awakening: A glorious end (spoilers!)", "date": "13/09/2017", "text": "True love all the way.After 20 exhilarating hours of play, my run of Awakening has come to an end. The final showdown was suitably epic, with my force making a beeline for Grima while weathering the relentless attacks of her minions. I let my strongest units gang up on her and the whole engagement was over after a mere couple of attacks, with Noire delivery the final blow. I then let my avatar nobly sacrifice herself for the greater good, only to have her revived in the last seconds of the ending sequence — and let's be honest, I totally expected that outcome. I mean, that's the least karma could grant me after I spent hours toiling to save the world from complete annihilation. Last but not least, Ricken got the gold medal, Miriel got the silver one and my avatar the bronze one. I really, really meant it when I said that Ricken was my absolute favourite unit. What more can I say? Awakening was an amazing game, a game I only enjoyed more and more as I played it. I really lapped up the no-frills yet deep gameplay, I grew to love the characters more and more as the game went on, and I absolutely adored the whole atmosphere of that game; and let's be honest, I currently have to fight strong urges to replay the whole thing all over again with a male avatar. One thing I didn't like much, on the other hand, is the storyline. Or, to be more precise, I didn't like the whole time travel shebang, which I deem superfluous and pretty much uncalled-for in the context of Awakening. Time travel never works properly as a narrative device; yet for some unfathomable reason, it pops up time and time again in manga, anime and games. From Dragon Ball to Sailor Moon to Steins;Gate, countless series have reprised the trope of the heroes' progeny hailing from a supposedly apocalyptic future and travelling back to the past to prevent said apocalyptic future from happening, armed with a grim sense of purpose and a truckload of unsolvable time paradoxes and plotholes. In a nutshell, Awakening dabbles in a theme that's all at once totally cliché and pitifully inefficient, and there was virtually no chance it would come unscathed out of it.My main problem with the time travel theme in Awakening is not so much the fact that it's bursting at the seams with plotholes — although it certainly doesn't help matters — but rather the fact that it's nothing more than a very transparent plot device whose sole purpose is to justify the presence of the characters' offspring as well as to make the double ending possible. The story would have been much more striking and efficient without that whole time travel mess: just let Validar be the vessel for Grima and find another explanation for my avatar's amnesia — like, she got a couple of fuses burnt after she tried to stop her evil father or something like that. Then, drop that crap about Grima being impossible to annihilate except by his own hand and let the crew slaughter him for good — all the more so as it doesn't make sense at all that Grima cannot be killed but can commit suicide. What is that, selective death? As for the offspring, well... How about going the sensible way and let the characters age for real? If the apocalyptic future theme is removed, then there is no need to rush things and the story can perfectly take place over the course of two decades. I think the story would actually work out better with a slower pacing and over a longer time period; it doesn't make much sense than my force can scour two continents and fight hundreds of foes over a mere one or two years as implied by the game. Then we could also dispense with the silly fan-service and not have Lucina pose as a boy and call herself Marth. Seriously, the girl deserved better than that cheap cross-dressing act.But enough with negative musings about Awakening's story; let's rather focus on the many excellent lessons I derived from that game. I'm now more confident about my ability to play Fire Emblem games my own way, and I'm definitely going to change a couple of things during my next incursion into the series:I'll use the best weapons as soon as they appear instead of shelving them and making do with low-class stuff. There is always better gear appearing as the game goes on anyway, so there's really no need to spare anything. I had tons of excellent weapons left in my inventory by the time I finished the game, weapons that could have been put to much better use. This won't happen again, I swear.I'll focus on my absolute favourite units, the ones I really have a crush on, and totally ignore the rest. Once again, the game consistently delivers new units over the course of a playthrough, so I can rest assured that I will find good recrues for my force no matter what.I'll wait until my units have reached Lv.20 before Master Sealing them. I was way too eager to promote them this time around, slapping Master Seals on them as soon as they reached Lv.10, and I lost a couple of yummy stats increases in the process. I'll sell right away the items I don't plan to use in order to buy items I do plan to use. During my playthrough, I kept Gaius Confects and Vulneraries in my inventory for hours \"just in case\", before finally admitting that this stuff didn't square with my playing style and that I would never touch it. No more. With that said, dear fellow gamers, I'm bidding Awakening adieu for the time being. Or am I? The game is still tugging at me, to be honest; and if it keeps obsessing me that way, then maybe I'll just cave in and polish off a second playthrough with a male avatar. As usual, I'll let my ever-dependable, all-powerful gaming instinct run the show! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Awakening: The Dream Team", "date": "09/09/2017", "text": "A.k.a my absolute favourite units, my own paragons of fighting awesomeness. I lavished copious amounts of pampering on these units, lovingly leveling them up and painstakingly maxing up their weapon proficiency chapter after chapter, and let me tell you: after all the hours I spent molding them into ultimate warriors, they will definitely stick with my avatar till the bitter end. Dear fellow gamers, let me introduce you right now to my own personal Awakening top 13!Anna: The resident trickster's inclusion into my force came as a bit of a surprise for me; because honestly, my initial feelings towards her were tepid at best and nonexistent at worst. Sure, her ditzy-yet-savvy personality was rather charming, and her ability to wield healing staves and open safes on top of being an attacker was quite interesting; but on the other hand, she could build up support with virtually no one, couldn't tie the knot at all, couldn't change class and didn't get nearly enough opportunities to deploy her safe-opening talents. I wasn't swept away, that's for sure; and yet, Anna managed to buid herself a place of choice in my force by sheer virtue of being a reliable unit and a great asset on the battlefield. She slowly grew into a formidable fighter, which is something I certainly didn't expect given her class; and her healing abilities came in handy more than once, not to mention her nimble fingers. With hindsight, I'm glad I took a chance on her and gave her the opportunity to shine, because she amply deserved it. Chrom: It's kind of hard not to include the face of Awakening into any top-unit list; Chrom is pretty much unmissable, if only because the game forces you to take him along on a regular basis. And yet, despite the fact that he's been involved in every single main story battle since the beginning of my run, my feelings towards him are quite ambivalent. The thing is, Chrom is not the best unit around despite being the game's poster boy. He hits quite hard, granted; but he's also surprisingly fragile and not really good at avoiding blows, which can lead to some unwelcome damage. Add to this a rather limited move range, and you get an unit that, while perfectly decent and serviceable, is not quite the crème de la crème. I like to compare Chrom's evolution in my force to Tuxedo Mask's evolution in the Sailor Moon series: both went from saving the day on a regular basis in the early stages to just being pretty in the background as time went on. It certainly doesn't help matters that getting Chrom killed always lands you a Game Over, even if your whole force is still standing. So, I can turn off Permadeath, but it's still a thing for Chrom? Can't he just scurry away to lick his wounds like the rest of the crew? All this makes Chrom a bit of a bothersome unit; and while I usually take him along for the ride, I use him solely to dispose of petty, weak foes that pose no threat to his health bar. I certainly wouldn't have him go at a boss and risk getting killed in the process, no thanks. Frederick: With his sturdiness and his ability to wield three different weapons, Frederick is a great asset in any force. Sure, the fact that he cannot change class is bothersome: it takes away some of his potential for Stat growth, which in turn leads to him losing his edge and being overrulled by newer units in the late stages of the game. That happened in my run, obviously: Frederick went from riding high at the top of my unit chart in the first chapters to lounging somewhere in the middle of said unit chart as I'm reaching chapter 20. That being said, he's still an excellent unit that didn't get killed a single time on the front despite taking part in virtually every single battle since the beginning of my run — a distinction very few units in my force can brag about. His tongue-in-cheek demeanour and motherly personality are also quite hilarious and really grew on me as time went on — although once again, he's been forced into the background by newer units and got very little screen time in the second half of the game. Gregor: The faux-Russian of Awakening gained entry to my force pretty much as soon as he appeared. He's sturdy, he hits like a beast, and he has this hilarious comedic Russian accent: what's not to love, seriously? Since that fateful first encounter, he's been getting even more awesome by acquiring incredibly useful Skills, such as Sol, which absorbs HP equal to half of the damage dealt, or Armthrift, which allows him to attack without wasting his weapons. He was delivered with Nowi as a package of sorts, and I just couldn't help but make them tie the knot; and given the lovely chemistry between the two of them, I have to assume that this was what the game wanted all along. And despite appearances, he's the younger one there by far, which creates a funny misunderstanding when the pair meets Chrom&co for the first time. Way to go and avoid accusations of lolicon, Intelligent System.   Libra: I just couldn't help but recruit the multi-tasking monk right away. One can always use a healer that also happens to be a capable attacker, especially when said healer has a really good move range. Libra cannot change class, and that's a bit of a shame; but he compensates that little flaw by his innate knack for multitasking and his great stats. Since he joined my force, he's gotten even more awesome by acquiring the skill Renewal, which restores 30% of his HP at the beginning of each turn; and even though his healing talents are required less often now that all my units have maxed out their levels, he's still pretty much an unmissable asset on the battlefield. His kind and unassuming personality is also quite refreshing, and it was great fun to pair him with brooding Tharja. For some silly reason, I'm quite glad Noire got his hair shade rather than Tharja's; there are so many dark-haired people in my force that a bit of blonde shine is much welcome. Maribelle: Let's face it: Maribelle is overall a lousy unit, even after Master Sealing. She's frail, she doesn't hit hard, she misses her aim on a regular basis; so why has she been in my force pretty much since the beginning? Well, simply because I adore her. This is a typical case of hanging onto a character regardless of their abilities — or lack thereof — because of intense feelings, and that's not something that often happens to me in RPGs. I love Maribelle's exuberant and sarcastic personality, her adorable character design, her flowery language — I'm just madly in love with her, period. I lavished a lot of time, attention and stat-raising items on her to mold her into a good fighter, and I'm glad to say that my efforts paid off. Although she's by no means one of my force's top dogs, she's able to endure hits much better now and to deal decent amounts of damage; and while one-shooting foes is but a distant dream for her, at least I can have her on the front row now instead of keeping her in the back to protect her. And my, her romance with Ricken is just too sweet for words. In a nutshell, Maribelle is not going anywhere and will be prancing on the battlefield until the credits roll.Miriel: I was initially not too fond of Miriel, to be honest. Her square, straight-A student personality really didn't click with me, and her drab garb didn't help her case. However, I quickly changed my mind when I saw her stellar performances on the battlefield, and she's been one of my top offensive units ever since, consistently wreaking havoc on the front row. She has a good array of really efficient passive buff and debuff Skills and she's sturdy as a horse when it comes to magic attacks, boasting the highest Resistance of all my units — along with Libra. Cherry on the cake, I adore her Sorcerer sprite; her outfit gained lovely azure and purple hues when she changed class, and she's now easier than ever to spot on the battlefield on top of looking really gorgeous. I'm really miffed I didn't manage to recruit her son; I'm sure the kid would have rocked just as much as his mother on the battlefield. Oh, well; I'll repair that oversight next time I play the game if Miriel still makes the cut — which will probably be the case, because she's just too awesome. Morgan: The avatar's child, which also happens to be Chrom's child in my run. Two children for one couple is a bit too much in a Fire Emblem playthrough, and I was initially planning to ditch Morgan without a second though and have him join my vast graveyard of unused units. So how did he ended up in my force after all, you may ask? Well, for the ficklest of reasons: I wanted another happily married couple in my roster, and he was my favourite available male unit as far as fighting performances were concerned. And I certainly don't regret what was essentially a whim on my part: to my surprise, Morgan quickly grew into a formidable fighter and a great asset on the battlefield. The Master Sealing treatment made him even more awesome, and he's now comfortably nested at the very top of my roster along the rest of the big shots. Sure, his personality is painfully transparent, he doesn't get any screen time in cutscenes, and he looks just utterly plain; but who cares about that when he can decimate lines upon lines of foes? He's pretty much the polar opposite of Maribelle, i.e. a unit I don't really fancy yet integrated into my force just by sheer virtue of his brilliant fighting performances. Noire: Libra and Tharja's offspring didn't impress me much at first. Despite the fact that I really wanted to integrate an archer into my force to be able to easily wipe out those pesky flying units, Noire's habit of dying early into battle made me dismiss her as yet another character that looked great at first glance yet couldn't hold their own on the battlefield. Just like Morgan, the only reason she was rehabilitated and joined my force at all is my fickle desire to play matchmaker; and just like Morgan, she proved to be an asset to be reckoned with once the right amount of level-grinding had been lavished on her. I can't say I'm fond of her switching personality and shrinking violet looks and gait; but once again, just like Morgan, her performances on the battlefield amply make up for her lack of attractiveness. I just resent the fact that because of her shooting range, she can easily get cornered by foes and find herself basically unable to move at all; as a result, it's really not a good idea to separate her from the rest of the crew and have her attack a bunch of foes on her own, lest you find yourself forced to dispatch another unit to rescue her. Tried and (de)tested, folks. Nowi: I had an instant crush on lovely Nowi as soon as she appeared and knew right away that I wanted her in my force. She never disappointed me: she's pretty strong overall, with excellent offensive abilities and stellar defense, and she's one of these units that can be sent on solo rampages without having to worry about her fainting and scurrying away. Sure, she lost a bit of her bite as the game went on, going from being able to one-shoot every living thing when she joined the fray to needing two blows to dispose of foes in late chapters; but that's the destiny of all old units, and that really didn't deter me from using her — all the less so as she remained sturdy and perfectly able to waltz and wreak havoc on the front lines. Her kid, on the other hand, failed to impress me and make the cut: poor Nah is a bit of a wallflower, really, and I don't fancy dragon units nearly enough to justify having more than one of them in my party anyway. Ricken: My little darling! The pint-sized mage can claim the honour of being my absolute favourite unit this time around. His absurd sturdiness and stellar offensive abilities make him an unmissable asset on the battlefield, and I've been using him in every single battle to great effect. And unlike many early units, he didn't lose his bite over time; on the contrary, he grew steadily more overpowered and unstoppable as the game went on. Master Sealing him into a Dark Knight made him a powerhouse that basically eats foes for breakfast and leaves no one alive in his wake. He's become a ferocious slaughterer that can be dispatched on his own on massive killing sprees rife with one-shooting; and with his awesome Lifetaker skill, which heals 50% of the user's HP after they defeat a foe, he can even take care of his own health perfectly. Why, it's like this skill has been designed especially for him! As a Dark Knight, he's supposed to be weak to mounted units; but honestly, that weakness is hardly noticeable, if at all. Frederick does take heavy damage from horsemen on a regular basis, but Ricken is pretty much unfazed by everything. He's a boss-slayer, a one-shooter and the absolute top unit of my roster, period. Say'ri: The Swordmaster made it into my force in a nearly stealthy way, and her inclusion into the roster kinda took me by surprise. What happened is that I was experimenting with new potential recrues at some point after her arrival, and she was one of the units I put to the test. She kept dying on a regular basis, and I really thought she wouldn't make the cut. But as I had a bit of room in my force at the time, I kept taking her into battle anyway; and to my surprise, she slowly but surely grew into a very competent fighter that could hold her own on the battlefield and deal good amounts of damage. The Vantage and Astra skills, which respectively allow her to strike first at all times if her HP is 50% or less and to pull off five consecutive strikes, make her even more dangerous; and it wasn't long before she joined the coveted club of units that can pretty much one-shoot their way to the objective. I'm a bit miffed that she cannot tie the knot nor build up support with anybody expect for Tiki and my avatar, but her stellar performances on the battlefield amply make up for that tiny flaw.Tharja: The game's resident Dark Mage was a pain to recruit: I had to restart her side story three times because she kept dying by recklessly throwing herself at my units and getting stupidly killed in return. That should definitely have deterred me from recruiting her; but for some reason, I had an inkling that she would be a valuable addition to my roster, and I was right. She was more than worth the hassle, as she quickly grew into a formidable assailant that could take down even the strongest armoured unit with insolent ease. She can take care of her own health just fine with Nosferatus, and Master Sealing her into a Dark Mage made her shoot straight to the top of my roster. She became virtually unstoppable after that, and she hadn't bit the dust a single time since her promotion. Her personality, on the other hand... Eh, I don't know. I think I'm just too old for all that cliché emo anime stuff; and her weird and awkward interactions with my avatar only made matters worse. I quickly grew tired of her brooding act, and I'm kinda glad that she consistently got less screen time as the game went on.There you have it, dear fellow gamers: the thirteen harbingers of doom that follow my avatar virtually everywhere, to the hell and beyond. Because indeed, my avatar is also part of my deadly roster; but as she's mostly a placeholder with a very predictable evolution, I didn't bother mentioning her in that list. Then you have all the units that interested me at first yet didn't make the cut because I got bored of them or because they bit the dust way too much for my taste: Sumia, Panne, Cordelia, Owain and Henry. Sorry, guys — maybe next time? And you have Lucina, which is a bit of a special case: despite her ridiculous strength and huge potential for growth, I just never liked her and thus didn't want to fully integrate her into my force. Since she appeared, I've been taking her along in battle when room was available, because I could always use her fighting abilities despite not being fond of her; but in my mind, she's not part of my force and never will be. Well, weirder things have happened in RPGs, I guess. And with that, dear fellow gamers, this post is coming to an end. I'll see you soon with my final Awakening report — because let's be honest, completion is near as I'm writing this. Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon thoughts and announcements", "date": "02/09/2017", "text": "Totally random Pokemon treat.Greetings, dear fellow gamers! As you undoubtedly noticed, I've played an awful lot of Pokemon solo runs lately; so many, in fact, that this blog could easily be granted the subtitle \"'The Serial Pokemon Solo Runner\". I'm really not in the mood for demanding, 50-hour-long RPG epics these days: the only thing I want to play are short games with relaxing game worlds, mellow gameplay and simple rules. The Pokemon series fits this description to a T, and that's why I've been playing virtually nothing but Pokemon entries these last weeks. And my Pokemon fever is not over yet, oh nooo. In fact, I'm about to tackle a special feature, which I proudly dubbed \"The Avian Solo Runs\". As you may have guessed from the title alone, this is a series of runs featuring the resident bird of each region — you know, that bird that can be captured on the very first Routes and ends up being a Fly slave in most runs. I've always been extremely fond of bird 'Mons and itching to cruise more often with them, and the time is ripe to do so. I'll thus perform an avian run of each generation — bar generation I and generation VII: the former because it features the same regional bird as generation II, and the latter because I already cleared a solo run with the local bird. Stay tuned for some avian action in the weeks to come, dear fellow gamers!Edit: Since writing that post, I learnt that the regional bird of Johto is supposedly Hoothoot rather than Pidgey. I find that notion debatable, since a) Pidgey and Spearow can also be captured on the first Routes and b) Gold and Silver were basically a remix of sorts of the gen I games and the concept of 'regional bird' was probably not a thing yet at the time. This theory is backed up by the fact that Hoothoot doesn't follow the usual Stat distribution of its supposed kind. Final forms of regional birds usually have high Attack and Speed, coupled with low defensive Stats and mediocre Sp.Attack; Noctowl, on the other hand, boasts high Sp.Attack, super-high Sp. Defense and low Attack. I'd be tempted to classify Hoothoot as a regular, non-regional bird — similar to Wingull, Farfetch'd or Ducklett — that was retrospectively branded as a regional for the sake of variety, and to assume that Pidgey is the regional bird of both Kanto and Johto; that would make perfect sense given the strong continuity between the gen I and gen II games and the fact that the two regions are basically next to one another. At any rate, I won't tackle a Hoothoot solo run of the gen II games; because as I'm writing this, I already have a Pidgey solo run of HeartGold under my belt and I really don't want to replay the whole game over again. Yeah, I'm kinda obsessed.And since we're talking about Pokemon and my current roaring obsession with it, I got to expand my knowledge of the games' core gameplay mechanics lately thanks to a number of really informative Youtube videos, which in turn led me to ponder a couple of technical matters that go as such:Knowing that EVs are raised by battling 'Mons and that each type of 'Mon delivers an EV boost in a given Stat, could a 'Mon running solo have all its EVs maxed out by the time it reaches the Pokemon League? I'd be tempted to believe that it is indeed the case, because a 'Mon that single-handedly takes down the fauna of a whole region has to get a ton of EV in all Stats. And there's another element that leads me to believe that solo runs are the perfect EV training regimen: the Effort Ribbon, which rewards a 'Mon with maxed-out EVs and which I'm quite sure I already obtained in some of my Pokemon solo runs. At any rate, I'm going to keep an eye on the Super Training feature when I tackle my avian solo run of X/Y and answer that question myself once and for all. Let's say you want to comply with the series' Western tagline and resident Pokemon Professor's orders and complete the Pokedex, going after all those elusive Legendaries, 'Mons with an insanely high evasion rate and other Feebasses. Given that the amount of money obtainable in the games is limited and that you cannot grind for more and that some 'Mons require an hefty number of tries before being caught, can a player find themselves in a situation where they are totally unable to complete the Pokedex because of a lack of funds to purchase Pokeballs? I never heard of anything like that, but I'd be really curious to know if it can concretely happen. Some 'Mons out there cannot be considered solo run material not because of their Stats, but rather because they appear way too late in the games to be viable candidates for solo runs. On the other hand, I've been wondering: since I own all pairs of Pokemon entries as well as extra 3DS, wouldn't it be possible to capture a late 'Mon in one of the games during a solo run, store said 'Mon, send it to the other game through trade and then tackle a solo run with it as usual? I would have to take into account matters such as the involved Mon's level and the number of Gym Badges needed to make it follow my orders; but technically, that should be possible. Now I just have to try it for myself. Having said that, dear fellow gamers, I'll see you soon for the first episode of my Avian Solo Run feature. I'm quite thrilled by this whole thing, and I just can't wait to revisit all generations and indulge in all sorts of feathery adventures. Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Awakening: I'm in deep", "date": "26/08/2017", "text": "Did I mention that I absolutely adore this game? I'm quite sure I didn't, because that's a pretty new development. I started falling in love with Awakening in earnest a couple of chapters ago (around Chapter 12, if I remember properly), when the game suddenly opened up and I gained access to more Side Stories and complimentary battles than ever before. I obviously lapped up all that free grinding and polished off all the extra engagements that were offered to me, raising all my favourite units' weapon proficiency to A and their levels to the big 20 in the process. Everybody that could benefit from a Master Seal got a class change, and my force is now pretty much set and ready to follow my avatar till the bitter end. And talking about my force, I'm totally planning to write a post about my units of choice before I wrap up the game. Stay tuned!Awakening is proving to be a much deeper game that Fates: Birthright, which only confirms that the latter is a truncated game and thus a complete rip-off. Maps in Awakening are ten times more varied than in Birthright, and the former doesn't need a browser game in disguise to keep players occupied. There's more than enough going on with the side stories, the complimentary battles, the recruitment, the refurbishment, the grinding to raise levels and unit closeness and last but not least, the romance. And talking about the romance, a couple more units tied the knot since my last post: Tharja and Libra, who go perfectly together as the brooding sorceress and the kind priest hiding dark secrets behind his ever-present smile; Gregor and Nowi, whose adorable relationship revolves around the latter crafting dragon scale outfits for the former; and last but not least, Noire and Morgan, whose hilariously silly love story involves the latter helping the former get rid of her fear of bugs.I would gladly have worked on more pairings; but alas, my force's size is limited, and some units cannot marry anyway. I obviously went out to my way to recruit my units' progeny, even though they didn't join my force afterwards most of the time; the only offspring that's yet missing is Frederick and Miriel's one, whom I failed to recruit when I polished off the 'Shadow in the Sands' Paralogue. (But hey, how could I have known that a potential unit was in hiding in one of the villages? That's not fair, game!) And heck, I just don't want my playthrough to end yet! I'm relishing that game so much that I want to keep basking in more grinding and swift battles. But all good things come to an end, including amazing runs; and as my force is leveled up to the max, Master Sealed and pimped up with the best gear available, it's now time to tackle the ultimate chapters and find out if my avatar is indeed an unwilling traitor, as the game has been implying pretty much since the beginning. Brace yourselves, last chapters: I'm coming full force — in every sense of the word.My only gripe with that amazing game so far is pretty much a pet peeve: to put it simply, I really dislike Awakening's soundtrack and voice acting. The former is just plain weird: if there's any such thing as martial elevator music, then Awakening's soundtrack is exactly that; and while those tracks have a way of getting stuck in my head, I just really, really don't fancy them. As for the latter, it's not really full-blown voice acting, just a couple of sentences thrown in here and there; yet those snipets have a way of not squaring with the characters' text nine times out of ten, effectively destroying the mood completely and preventing immersion. Complete silence would definitely have been a better choice, if you ask me. With that said, dear fellow gamers, I'll leave you for the time being; I have battles to fight and a playthrough to wrap up. I'll see you soon with an exhaustive breakdown of my favourite units; until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Sonic Lost World and Sonic Generations: A miss and a miss", "date": "19/08/2017", "text": "I admit it: the Sonic game I really want to play right now is Sonic Mania, the homage-heavy, long-overdue, critically praised 2D sequel to Sonic&Knuckles. Alas, Vita and 3DS owners were collectively denied the joy of playing that game; and thus I have to make do with erzatz such as Sonic Generations and Sonic Lost World to quell my Sonic thirst on the 3DS. Those two games have been sitting in my collection for, like, forever; it's thus time to give them an opportunity to prove themselves — if only to be able to sell them for good money while the 3DS is still supported in case they turn out to be disappointing. And as you may have infered already from the title alone, those two games were indeed disappointing; and we'll see right away how they failed to dazzle and impress the Sonic fan in me.First is Sonic Lost World, the spiritual successor to the ill-fated Sonic X-treme on the Saturn. Resurrecting games that failed to come to existence is a great idea on paper, but it can easily go haywire; after all, those games failed to make the cut in their time for a reason, and that reason may or may not involve unpractical gameplay concepts. And in the case of Sonic X-treme and Sonic Lost World, I'd be more than tempted to assume that the former was indeed shelved because its gameplay proved unsatisfactory and that the latter shouldn't have existed at all in its current form. I've read horrible, horrible things about Lost World's level design and control schemes — a couple of levels being singled out and branded as pure torture tools prone to make even the most seasoned and patient Platformer aficionado ragequit. I couldn't verify this assertion myself, though, because I quit before the end of the second level. I didn't ragequit, mind you; I just quietly put the console down, quietly took the cartridge off and quietly put it back into its box, never to be touched again — all that because I wasn't enjoying the ride.Mind you, things started nicely enough, giving me good hopes that I could indeed like that game. The controls were sleek and precise, the aerial-based gameplay instantly clicked with me and spiraling up and down the tubular zones was great fun. Sure, said zones were a bit too long for their own good, colours were a bit too dark for my taste, and the music was lacklustre; but I could perfectly live with that if the gameplay rocked. I cleared the tutorial and the first zone without too much hassle; then came the second zone, and I starting falling to my death. A lot. Those repeated falls conjured up horrible memories of Super Mario Land; and with that, the die was cast. I can tolerate tweaks to the classic Sonic formula quite good-naturedly, as my appreciation of Shattered Crystal abundantly proves; but having levels that are basically giant bottomless pits with a couple of platforms hovering around is where I draw the line. And mind you, those early levels are supposed to be easy and forgiving compared to later levels, which makes me think that there's no way in hell I could ever clear that game. I might as well save myself a couple of painful ragequits and spare a couple of good gaming hours by selling Lost World right away.Then there is Sonic Generations, i.e. the game that nearly single-handedly made me purchase a 3DS back in 2011 — before I wisely decided that a DSi with Sonic Classic Collection was a better investment. This game is a self-celebratory monument of fan-service that tries its hardest to unite all Sonic aficionados under its banner and please older as well as newer fans — and fails utterly at it. The main issue lies in Generations' very concept, which is inherently flawed and a recipe for bombing. Offering flashy remade versions of old zones sounds like a Sonic fan's wet dream on paper; yet in practice, it's bound to disappoint basically everybody by sheer virtue of offering a limited selection of zones. It was pretty obvious that every single fan was going to be miffed that their favourite zones were not included and pissed off at the inclusion of some other zones they happen to dislike. Was I miffed and pissed off? Heck, you bet: I don't care whatsoever about the zones lifted from the 3D entries, but I would have killed to play remade versions of Flying Battery, Lava Reef and Dead Line — with a gloriously remixed soundtrack to boot. And was there really no better pick from the Rush games than Water Palace? How about Sky Babylon and its amazing theme track? And how about lifting Aquarium Park or Starlight Carnival from Colours, rather than the ultra-generic Tropical Resort? I could go on and on like that, just like probably every single Sonic fan that purchased that game. The only way to avoid such ramblings would have been to include every single zone created since the dawn of the series; and with a meagre seven zones for the 3DS version, the Sonic Team kinda missed the mark, if you ask me.Mind you, Generations is a perfectly serviceable game with glossy graphics, sharp controls and a lovely celebratory vibe, and I polished it off nearly entirely, omitting only the irritating final boss; yet as decent as it is, there is no chance I'll ever touch it again. It's just too bland, too stingy and overall too unsatisfactory. What's the point of rushing through a measly selection of zones when I could just as easily replay the original games? Not to mention that the 'modern' 3D stages make me feel nauseous and that the Sonic Team managed to squeeze in a corny story that tries — and laughingly fails — to rationalize the presence of the two gameplay styles instead of letting zones flow and fans enjoy the game for the shameless fan-servicey treat it is. With Generations and Lost World being dismissed as unsatisfactory instalments and on their way to the closest second-hand shop, I now find myself in the very weird situation of being able to bandy Shattered Crystal as my favourite 3DS Sonic entry. But hey, that's Sonic Team's fault for releasing experimental and half-hearted games instead of building upon the series' strengths. The DS entries did a great job at restoring the series' former glory; so why not expand on them, instead of resurrecting a dead unfinished game and wallowing in selective fan-service? Where is the third Rush instalment or the sequel to Colours, for instance? Heck, just because the 3DS has '3D' in its name doesn't mean that all games released on it have to go for full 3D, as the Boom subseries cleverly figured out. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to curl into a ball in a corner and come to terms with the fact that I'll probably never get to play the flashy, shiny and lush Sonic Mania. Or will I? After all, I still didn't write off the Switch entirely, now did I? Maybe I'll play that game in a few years after all, if I follow my own plans and invest in a Switch towards the end of the system's lifetime. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Awakening: Smooth sailing", "date": "13/08/2017", "text": "A couple of extra hours of play under my belt since my last post, and I'm still enjoying Awakening quite a lot. The ennui that viciously gripped me during my Fates playthrough is nowhere to be felt now, and I sure hope that things will stay that way until the end. I finally decided to stick with my female avatar, leaving an hypothetical male run as an option for future runs; and while I was at it, I got my claws into Chrom and made him my avatar's husband. I seriously doubt this romantic move will unlock anything interesting, but better safe than sorry. It's not like there were a lot of interesting bachelors anyway; the female characters are definitely more alluring, and I'll sure have a hard time choosing my mate when I replay the game with a male avatar — although I've already set my sights on a couple of ladies. But I digress; let's move back to my current playthrough and its unexpected developments.Or maybe not so unexpected; because let's be honest, Fates had already pulled the exact same trick on me — and I fell for it once again like the FE debutant I am. I'm obviously referring to both games' propensity to offer powerful new units on a silver platter as chapters go by, prompting the player to ditch their overpowered old units without a second thought to focus on the flashy newcomers. That's how I found myself dropping newly wedded Vaike and Sully as well as Lon'qu and Lissa when Libra, Tharja, Gregor and Nowi joined my force. I feel a bit guilty about virtually abandoning the former on the highway after they served me so dutifully since the beginning of my run; but hey, what else could I do? The new units are just ten times more colourful and entertaining, and they are incredible assets on the battlefield to boot. And with Libra joining the fold, I now have three Healers on my hands, and that's definitely one too much. I love Maribelle too much to let go of her, and Libra is such a perfect embodiment of multitasking that I cannot think of parting with him for the life of me; so Lissa has to go, despite the fact that she's one of the main players in the story. And if Lissa goes, so does her husband Lon'qu — heck, the guy has a ridiculously tiny move range anyway. As for Sully and Vaike, they were always pis aller units that I used to fill up my force, so I certainly won't miss them too much.Having said that, I'm a bit miffed by Fates' and Awakening's propensity to force planned obsolescence on the player by making newer units more attractive than older ones — or rather, I'm miffed by my own propensity to fall prey to that trick and lavish time and energy on units that I don't really fancy and won't keep in my roster till the bitter end. That's a full-blown case of sunk cost fallacy if I ever saw one; yet I cannot help but being salty about all that lost XP that could have been used to power up my absolute favourite units. Now, my own naivety and lack of insight in all things unit management are perfectly forgivable given that I'm still a complete FE noob; but let me tell you, I won't be one forever. I'm currently experiencing burgeoning yet irrepressible impulses to play it my way, taking a page from my own serial solo runner book and focusing exclusively on my very favourite units, even if that involves taking less characters along for the ride than the game actually allows. My next run of a 3DS FE game is definitely going to follow that pattern, and I'll bend the genre to my tastes and make it ten times more enjoyable in the process.Never were deeper words of love spoken.And since I've been referring to my favourite units over and over, I might as well introduce them right now. We have the Miriel/Frederick pair, two powerhouses with a really lovely and totally believable love story; and then we have my absolute little darlings, the Ricken/Maribelle pair, whose love story is so sweet and utterly perfect that it made me all mushy inside. Ricken is ridiculously strong despite his tiny stature and young age; and while Maribelle is not that useful on the battlefield, the idea of parting with her just tears my heart out. Then you have the quatuor I mentioned earlier, which made quite an impression, as well as new arrival Anna, which I may or may not intregate into my force depending on her performances on the battlefied and on the evolution of my feelings towards her. I mean, I was initially quite fond of Panne and Cordelia before their mediocre fighting performances and transparent personalities prompted me to ditch them without a second thought.With that said, I'll see you soon with more Awakening reports, dear fellow gamers! There will be blood and romance, new recruits as well as new romantic developments. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Black: The Scolipede Solo Run", "date": "05/08/2017", "text": "Until very recently, I was under the impression that I still had to run solo with a great many Pokemon Types; but lo and behold, it turns out that I've actually covered most of the Type spectrum — all the more so if double Typing is taken into account — and that the Types I've not dabbled in yet can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The 'Mon du jour, i.e. vividly coloured, blasé-eyed Venipede, is taking me not just one, but two steps closer to full Type coverage with his double Bug-Poison typing. I've been fond of Venipede ever since I encountered him on the Route 6 bushes in Kalos (and I'm not the only one, since a Venipede run was endorsed enthusiastically by faithful readers Sieg and Kumiko). There's something endearing about that garish insect that I just can't explain with words; and while his middle form is a bit, shall we say, inexpressive, his gigantic final evolution manages to be all at once baddass, hilarious and adorable. What's not to like about a nonchalant giant magenta centipede, seriously?My Venipede and her evolutions — collectively known as Venin — did a stellar job on the battlefield, despite rocky beginnings. The main issue was Venipede's and Whirlipede's low Attack, which made one-shooting opponents a distant dream; fortunately, I was helped on the offensive front by my Venin's awesome ability Poison Point, which helped me eliminate more than one assaillant. As soon as my foe was poisoned after a hit, I would spam Protect and let the poison do its work and dispose of the obstruction for me. That sure is a roundabout way to win, but it certainly did the job; however, Poison Point's magic became virtually unecessary after Venin crossed the ultimate evolutionary threshold, gaining sky-high Attack in the process. I got hold of a couple of neat Moves throughout my run; and by the time I reached the late stages of the game, I was pretty much set on Poison Tail (Poison), Bulldoze (Ground), X-Scissors (Bug) and Facade (Normal). The latter was more or less a pis aller: I wanted my beloved Return, but alas, I didn't find it during my run, nor did I find a more powerful Physical Poison Move than Poison Tail. Nonetheless, that Move quatuor was more than powerful enough to wreak havoc on the battlefield — at least, it was so until the first Elite Four showdown and rolling of credits. I'll be blunt: even after three runs of the Black/White pair, I still find the forced double Elite Four showdown just as hard to swallow as when I was first confronted to it. In fact, I find it even harder to swallow after having been acquainted with the awesomeness of Black and White's direct sequels, the Black 2/White 2 pair — a.k.a. the games that single-handedly made me fall head over heels in love with generation V. Compared to these sequels' swift, smooth and near-perfect pacing, the pacing of the prequels sucks, with their abrupt ending, overblown postgame and Elite Four force-feeding. Technically, everything that happens after beating N belongs to postgame territory, since we get a credit roll after that victory; and yet, beating the Elite Four a second time triggers another credit roll while at the same time not ending the game for good, which is the clumsiest setting ever. How many postgames does this game have, exactly? I'm also not fond at all of the massive difficulty spike that occurs after the first rolling of credits, which I deem totally uncalled for. I swear that Moves that could one-shoot opponents with ease before the fight against N were suddenly rendered unable to knock out anything cold after the credits rolled, and that seriously hampered my ride. Let me enjoy my overleveling in peace, dang it!Now, I can appreciate how GameFreak tried to break the mold with these games. The idea of making the resident Champion fail and be beaten by N, only to make you the Champion in all but name when you wipe the floor with the latter, was a really innovative idea that introduced a welcome modicum of drama in the franchise. Having you fight the Elite Four a second time to become the official Champion once the Team Plasma menace is more or less eradicated was also a thrilling challenge, and so was the scouring of Unova and hunting of the remaining Seven Sages led by Looker (which, for the record, I have yet to endurtake). All this was really neat and exciting on paper; but unfortunately, the execution is flawed. The first rolling of credits comes too early in the game and way too abruptly, leaving all at once too many places to explore and a sour feeling of unfinished business; and the unneeded difficulty spike that ensues makes the task of exploring said places and finishing said business all the more tedious and wearying. Reaching the Elite Four the second time around is busy work, and I have no qualms about admitting that I did it solely to get a celebratory post-victory snapshot with my Venin and that she gobbled more dope than a Tour de France rider in order to be ultimately featured on said snapshot. Lazy and vain gamer is lazy and vain!But hey, the first part of that run was pure delight, and it was a satisfactory experience overall. Having said that, I'm not too sure I will replay Black and White too often after that, lest they host an exclusive 'Mon I really want to run solo with. Black 2 and White 2 are so much more polished, so much more rewarding and so much better overall that I declare them henceforth my reference games and go-to entries for generation V. And with that Venipede solo run under my belt, I'm now inching closer to full Type coverage. Ground, Ice, Electric, Dragon and Fairy 'Mons, you're next on my To-Run-Solo-With list! Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Awakening: Taking it easy", "date": "30/07/2017", "text": "So I'm playing Fire Emblem: Awakening these days, and I'm doing so in the most casual way possible. I found out that this game lends itself really well to very short playing sessions and is just the perfect game to fiddle with when you're stuck performing mundane, unescapable tasks — for instance, I polished off a battle the other day while I was cooking pancakes and it was a much welcome and pleasant diversion. Since then, I've been snatching ten minutes here, fifteen minutes there, for a total play time of roughly three hours. Playing Awakening in such a disjointed way obviously makes the task of keeping track of the story a tad harder; but I'm handling it well so far, mostly due to the fact that Awakening's story is more streamlined and less convoluted that Fates' one. And since I'm mentioning Fates, I must insert a disclaimer before going any further: since Fates was my first ever Fire Emblem game, my writing about Awakening is going to be brimming with Fates comparisons. With that said, on with the show!To be honest, this game has a lot going for it. Apart from its aforementioned player-friendliness and streamlined story, I'm totally in love with the art style used in cutscenes, and I really dig the fact that the action flows without pause and that I don't need — at least so far — to waste some time taking care of headquarters and effectively playing a browser game in disguise. I'd much rather be prowling the land with a limited team of characters — although if Fates is any indication, I'll probably end up with a full regiment by the end of my playthrough. I also find quite interesting that my avatar is not the main hero of Awakening, but rather an observer of sorts that finds themselves embroiled in a conflict that seemingly doesn't concern them. Of course, if the opening cutscene is any indication, it will probably turn out that my avatar is deeply linked to Awakening's events after all and that their amnesia is due to time travel or something similar. But hey, let's play and see! I'm just here to enjoy what the game has to offer, from the smooth no-casualties battles to the striking no-feet character designs.On the negative side, I could mention the fact that the cast is painfully transparent: they feel like unpolished beta versions of the colourful Fates cast, and the fact that they are all dressed in drab garb certainly doesn't help. The most interesting character, apart from my own avatar, has to be Chrom; but he's still dull and unremarkable compared to, say, a Kaze or a Silas. And since I'm mentioning Chrom, I'm pretty miffed that Awakening is actually sneaking in some romantic innuendos between him and Sumia. How dare you, game? As the resident hero and face of Awakening, Chrom should be my avatar's exclusive turf, period. I was planning to bag him up from the very start in the hope of unlocking interesting narrative developments; now, I feel like a homewrecker of sorts doing just that, and that's totally your fault, IS. To add fuel to the fire, those romantic innuendos between Chrom and Sumia are ten times more romantic and touching than the support conversations between the former and my avatar, which revolve solely about bumping into each other in the steam tent and thus forming a bond thanks to the shared experience of having seen the other naked — jeez, kill me already. Now that I think of it, Sumia is really lovely, and I sure would love to snatch her away from Chrom. Hey, maybe I'll just restart the game with a male avatar; I can afford to lose three hours, and I'm starting to get the feeling that Awakening's story would work out better with a male avatar, just like I got the feeling that the Fates story would work better with a female avatar back in the days. And if the chemistry between Chrom and my avatar — or complete lack thereof — is any indication, I won't miss on a lot of character and narrative developments anyway.Well, I'll ponder that option in the next days; and at any rate, I'll see you soon with more Awakening goodness, dear fellow gamers. I can safely state that for now, I like Awakening much more than Fates, despite the dull cast and disappointing interactions between my avatar and the game's resident hero. Now that I think of it, my aborted romance with Azura in Fates was also quite lacklustre; maybe it's just a better idea to woo secondary characters than to make a pass at the cover character in Fire Emblem games. Until next time, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon X: The Delcatty Solo Run - Epilogue", "date": "22/07/2017", "text": "I'm writing this post fresh from my Elite Four victory with Delcatty, a victory that was as unexpected as it was delicious. The fact that I can brag about being the Kalos Champion in my Skitty Solo Run of X can be attributed solely to Sieg, who judiciously reminded me of the existence of the TM Hidden Power in the comment section of my first Skitty solo run post. Hidden Power being a Move that's not affected by bloody Normalize in Generation VI, that meant that my Delcatty could effectively get her paws on a surefire way to get rid of Ghost 'Mons — providing, of course, that her Hidden Move Type wouldn't be Fight, which would be the worst stroke of bad luck ever. It turned out that my Delcatty's Hidden Power Type was Steel, which delighted me since I've not been using Steel Moves since my Piplup solo run of Platinum. Little did I know that Steel was possibly one of the worst possible Hidden Power Types in the context of my run — but more on that very soon.The Hidden Power hack worked beautifully, and I was at long last able to wipe the floor with Ghost 'Mons; and boy, did it feel vengefully good after a whole run spent avoiding them, cowering at the though of encountering them and being gripped by dread when getting stuck in a battle against them. They still managed to be a bit of a hassle, mind you. Hidden Power doesn't hit that hard to begin with, and my Delcatty's Sp.Attack, while being respectfully high, was still much lower than her Attack; as a result, one-shooting Ghost 'Mons was but a distant dream that never materialized — all the less so as my Delcatty has already hit the big 100 level-wise when she learnt Hidden Power. Still, I could at least progress unhindered and reach the Pokemon League to engage in what would turn out to be one of the most challenging and nerve-racking Elite Four showdowns of my gaming career.Trembling yet? Oh yeah, you should. Oh boy, that Elite Four showdown. The least I could say about it is that it had a serious case of mood swings. Either I was one-shooting opponents at the very first turn or I was sweating and struggling and toiling for minutes on end. To ensure a smooth progression, I stuffed my Delcatty with Battle Items at the beginning of each face-off, and that worked nicely enough; however, I had stupidly forgotten to stock up X Sp.Atk, and that oversight would prove lethal against the Elite Four Ghost 'Mons. Because indeed, my Delcatty was pitted against more than just one Ghost 'Mon during that showdown: there were three of them, and they were all a pain in the butt. Chandelure and Gourgeist took a million turns to faint, with Hidden Power only taking a small chunk of their life bars at a time and their Trainers healing them at least twice in a row and ruining all my arduous efforts. But as annoying as these two Ghost obstructions were, they were small fry compared to their colleague: Aegislash, a.k.a. The Most Tedious Elite Four 'Mon I Ever Fought and Delcatty's Absolute Bane.I never thought much of Aegislash, but that disparaging point of view certainly changed radically after facing him with Delcatty in the X Pokemon League. That fight necessited two attempts and nearly made me tear up with sheer frustration and powerlessness; and when I finally managed to wrap things up, it was after fifteen minutes of arduous fighting. Let me tell you: never had I been that relieved to wrap up a Pokemon battle. I let out a huge sigh, threw my head back and beamed in sheer relief, fervently wishing never to encounter an Aegislash again. Ever. Because my, that 'Mon was the biggest nuisance ever and a monstrous challenge to overcome. And I don't play Pokemon solo runs to have it hard: on the contrary, I play them to make things easy, mellow and smooth. I run solo to bask in the thrill of one-shooting my way through regions, drinking in the sights and chatting with NPCs without having to bother about recruitment, training, breeding and fighting strategies. I obviously relish the occasional challenge during my Pokemon solo runs; but oh gosh, was Aegislash a giant, tough bite to swallow.But enough fluff; let's get to the point and peel this most arduous battle against X's resident sword 'Mon. That formidable opponent had a deadly card up its sleeve: the Stance change, which makes it swing between being an mortal offensive powerhouse and a impenetrable defensive fortress. Oh, and did I mention it's resistant to Steel? Yep, the same Steel my Delcatty's Hidden Power TM belonged to. Here's how things unfolded: I was basically stuck in a vicious circle of trying to hit Aegislash when it was in the offensive Stance and healing from its destructive blows when it was in the defensive Stance, all this complicated by the fact that Stance changes are totally random. But wait, there was worse: prior to the fight against Aegislash, I had faced Klefki, which had left me with a nasty souvenir as it went down: a full-blown case of Torment. So on top of having to deal with Aegislash's random Stance changes, I had to juggle between Moves to be able to use my precious Hidden Power. Needless to say, a lot of blows went down the drain during that fight. Of course, Wikstrom healed Aegislash as I was about to finish it, forcing me to restart the whole process over again. That torturous fight's only saving grace was that I had miraculously hold onto three X Sp.Atk. until that point, which my Delcatty gobbled avidly and which undoubtedly played a huge part into making that fight winnable at all. I struggled and toiled and soldiered on through the pain and the drawbacks, and I finally managed to throw that cursed sword back into its pokeball. And I'll be damned if this wasn't my hardest Elite Four fight ever.But you know what? All these hardships made my ultimate Elite Four victory all the sweeter. Ghost 'Mons were a huge thorn in my side during my whole Skitty solo run of X, and to manage to overcome these pests and thumb my nose at them was well-deserved payback. Needless to say, being able to salvage my run and snatch a clean victory from adversity's jaws was also immensely satisfying; I never like to give up on Pokemon solo runs, especially when they're going smoothly and chances of success are high. A big shout-out to you, Sieg, for the inspired suggestion that ultimately allowed me to wrap up this solo run! Having said that, I still want to tackle a solo run of White 2 with a Cute Charm Skitty; but maybe I'll warp things up a trifle to make said run more interesting, for instance by not making my Skitty evolve into Delcatty. My, wouldn't that be a blast to beat the Elite Four with a cute pink kitten? Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Five totally random gaming anecdotes", "date": "16/07/2017", "text": "Let's face it, dear fellow gamers: we all more or less play the same games, but what make our own gaming career unique is the mass of entertaining and distinctive little events that unfold around our playing. Without further ado, here are five random anecdotes lifted from different eras of my gaming life. Enjoy!What the heart wants: 2014 marked the absolute peak of my collecting endeavours, as well as the release of Selena Gomez' single \"The heart wants what it wants\"; and as unlikely as it may seem, these two events are correlated in my gaming life. It so happened that one fateful day, as I was browsing the internet in search of games, the radio played Selena's freshly released forlorn love call; and upon hearing the song's chorus, I couldn't help but laugh at how perfectly the lyrics fitted my current situation. There I was, hunting for games despite the fact that a backlog the size of the Mont-Blanc was waiting for me — because, you know, the heart wants what it wants. After this episode, the song became my official Game Hunting Song for a couple of weeks, and I played it every time I looked for and purchased games online. To this day, hearing the song still stirs up memories of browsing through Ebay and Amazon pages along with a sweet, aching longing for games I didn't own yet.Missing memories: I owned three consoles over the '90s: a Game Boy, a Game Gear and a Mega Drive, none of which I still own to this day. But while I can remember perfectly how I parted ways with my beloved Sega duo, I'm totally unable to conjure up memories of how my no less beloved Game Boy exited the scene. This is the weirdest thing ever, especially considering how extensive and precise my memories of the system are: I remember every single Game Boy game I bought or borrowed — up to very the last one, a broken mess of a game called Titus the Fox that made me give up on the console entirely. This was in 1995; and I have no memories at all of playing my Game Boy or even handling it beyond that year. Now, 1995 is also the year I got my Game Gear; and I reckon that the two events are actually linked. Although I have no memories of it whasoever, I'm pretty sure that I sold my Game Boy and its game library after the Titus the Fox debacle in order to get the necessary funds to purchase my Game Gear. That sure would explain neatly why my Game Boy seems to have disappeared from the face of the Earth after 1995, and how I was able to treat myself to a brand-new Game Gear despite the fact that I was still an idle teenager at the time.Collecting karma: In 2013, I imported a second-hand copy of Children of Mana for the DS for a couple of euros. Upon opening the box, I discovered that it contained an unexpected guest: in the GBA slot was nested a pristine copy of Pokemon Emerald in all its shiny and transluscent glory. The former owner of my Children of Mana copy had obviously either forgotten it or put it there to get rid of it, and I pondered what I should do with that surprise gift. And since I neither owned a GBA nor knew the Pokemon series at the time, I seriously considered tossing it away. Tossing. It. Away. A nearly brand-new copy of Pokemon bloody Emerald. I very nearly did it, and I shudder at the thought that I could have thrown away such a valuable game in such a careless way. But wait, I hear you say, couldn't that complimentary Emerald copy simply be a crappy bootleg that its owner didn't care one bit about? Well, this possibility obviously came to my mind after I became acquainted with the series, and I put the cartridge through a thorough examination. And guess what? This is the real thing. It's a totally authentic and legit copy of Pokemon Emerald, and I got it virtually for free. This was my biggest gaming stroke of luck ever, a splendid gift from the Universe; and it certainly repayed me beautifully for these early collecting stages when I found myself routinely paying way too much for games because I didn't know better.Games before consoles: When the Vita was released, its \"AAA games on a portable console\" selling motto made me write it off as a system that was not tailored at all to my gaming needs and tastes. But at some point in 2014, I saw a trailer for New Little King's Story and my interest in the system was suddenly piqued. I set out to purchase a brand-new Vita; but to my utter dismay, there were none available in my area. However, a shipment was expected at some unspecified date in the near future; so I could rest assured that I would indeed net a Vita sooner or later. My collector instinct was fully awakened though, and I needed to unleash it and let it soar without delay; and that's how I found myself hunting for good bargains on Vita games on the internet while not even owning the console yet. And it so came to pass that when brand-new Vitas finally graced my local game store with their much-awaited presence, I already owned half a dozen Vita games. But the story doesn't stop here, oh no: it took me one more year to play my very first Vita game — which, for the record, was Sorcery Saga. And guess what? I absolutely hated the Vita upon first play. The analog sticks felt utterly foreign, the screen was way too big, the graphics were too sleek and polished, and the console left such a bad overall impression on me that I turned it off and put it right back in its box with a lot of huffing and puffing. Good thing I picked it up again a week later and managed to overcome my initial repulsion, or I would have missed on what turned out to be one of my favourite handhelds of all time — as well as on a ton of stellar games.The rearguard: I happened to be part of the very last bunch of subscribers to the now defunct Official Nintendo Magazine UK: I subscribed in early 2013, only to see the magazine bail out in october 2014, a mere year and a half later. To see that publication edge closer and closer to its unavoidable retirement was quite an eerie experience, I must say. In true Nintendo-ish fashion, the publisher and writing staff didn't mention that ONM was slated for execution before said execution was nearly upon us subscribers; but one could feel that something was fishy many months before we were actually notified that our subscriptions were cancelled. The magazine's content was incredibly poor, with safe and boring interviews of Nintendo developers and dull previews and reviews of big titles that were published again and again under a slightly different form each time. There were no in-depth analyses, no retro features, no cutting-edge and informative interviews; in a nutshell, there was none of what I actually expected to find in a magazine devoted to Nintendo consoles and games. But when the list of staff members and contributing writers started shrinking literally every month, I knew that the writing was on the wall. I certainly didn't regret the magazine's half-baked and snooze-inducing content in the slightest; on the other hand, it was a bit of a nasty blow to be ousted from my own subscription. I had already missed out on the most famous gaming magazines of the '90s; and now that I could finally bask in the joy of being a gaming magazine subscriber, that long-awaited joy was taken from me after barely one year? Sheesh, talk about the Universe not wanting me to read gaming publications. Good thing I managed to unearth other interesting and — most importantly — thriving gaming magazines and to get a good subscription pool after that.Now that you've been reading these anecdotes and hopefully enjoying them, I have a favour to ask of you, dear fellow gamers. See, what I enjoy even more than pondering all the little quirks of my gaming life is to learn about the little quirks of other gamers' gaming life. You guess where I'm going with that, I'm sure: I'd like you to tell me some gaming anecdotes of your own in the comments, dear fellow gamers. Numbers don't matter; just feel free to tell as many or as few stories as you wish, and I'll read them all with great delight. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon X: The Delcatty Solo Run", "date": "09/07/2017", "text": "Skitty is the mysterious 'Mon that nearly single-handedly made me give up on my planned Eevee solo run. When I encountered him in Castelia City, I was instantly reminded of my delicious playthrough of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky and the great time I had had handling this lovely pink feline, and I wondered why the idea of tackling a Skitty solo run had not dawned on me earlier. The time was more than ripe to address this oversight, and I decided to do so in Pokemon X instead of White 2/Black 2. For one thing, I was getting a teeny-tiny bit tired of cruising Unova; for another, Skitty appears right after the first Gym in X and I wanted to cruise with him as early as possible; and last but not least, I was dying to pet and feed the adorable kitty into oblivion in Pokemon-Amie.I was expecting that run to be business as usual, but things didn't exactly unfold as planned. Skitty is great solo run material on paper, with balanced stats and a decent offensive Move pool that guarantees an efficient Type coverage. I was struggling a bit in the early stages of the games — the first fight against Lucario being an especially gritty point — but the discovery of a Moon Stone and my Skitty's subsequent evolution into Delcatty gave me a welcome stat boost and some much-needed room in all things fighting. I was set for a smooth ride, or so I thought; but the game had other plans for me. I started sensing something was amiss when none of my Skitty's Moves was able to scratch a random Ghost 'Mon. Now, I fully expected Return and Wake-up Slap to be unefficient; but Dig and Feint Attack? By all accounts and to the best of my knowledge, these last two Moves should have taken care of Ghost 'Mons allright, and yet they were entirely useless, making my Skitty powerless and unable to dispose of Ghost 'Mons. At first, I could rely on my crew of HM slaves to take down these irritating ghostly obstructions; but as the game progressed, these HM slaves became underleveled and I had no choice but to swiftly run away from random battles and carefully avoid all Trainers armed with Ghost 'Mons. This was manageable, if only a tad irritating; but it didn't explain why my Ground and Dark Moves were suddenly unable to pummel Ghost 'Mons into oblivion.It took me a while, but I finally uncovered the very logical reason for my Skitty's powerlessness against the Ghost crew; and that reason is none other than the Normalize ability, which transforms all Moves into Normal Moves. While this gives a welcome boost on the battlefield thanks to the STAB, it also makes the Normalize version of Skitty a genuinely unfit candidate for a solo run — the first I've encountered since I started soloing Pokemon games, en passant. Because indeed, Skitty comes in two versions ability-wise: the one with Normalize, and another with Cute Charm. It was my bane to get a Skitty with the former; had I gotten a Skitty boasting Cute Charm, I would have blasted through the game without noticing anything. And I would now be crowned Champion instead of stalling at the entrance of Victory Road.Because indeed, I didn't reach the Elite Four. By the time I polished off the eight Gyms, my Skitty's lack of bite against all things ghostly had grown into a regular and unavoidable issue: at that point, I was basically unable to dispose of Ghost 'Mons, be it with Skitty or my HM slaves. I didn't want to tackle the Elite Four without a fair bit of checking, knowing that a mere single Ghost 'Mon could stop my Skitty dead in her tracks. And lo and behold, it turned out that there was indeed a Ghost 'Mon in the Elite Four roster: Chandelure, a dual Fire/Ghost 'Mon handled by Fire Trainer Malva. That put an end to my lofty Elite Four dreams, and I gave up on my run after roughly 17 hours of play. Now, if I ever tackle a Skitty solo run again, I'll obviously make sure that I recruit a creature with the Cute Charm ability. I'd like to cruise Unova with a Skitty, if only because I like the kitten's sprite in White 2/Black 2; so a Skitty solo run redux is not entirely out of the question. The lovely feline didn't get to prove herself fully, and I want to let her strut her stuff on the Elite Four grounds. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Black 2: (Proudly presenting) the Boldore Solo Run ", "date": "02/07/2017", "text": "A.k.a. The Run I Would Never Have Dreamt of Tackling in a Million Years. The very existence of that unlikeliest of runs can solely be attributed to a tease from faithful reader Sieg, who innocently dropped a little bomb in the comment section of my Tepig Solo Run report going as such: \"If you ever solo Pokémon BW/BW2 with Roggenrola, I have to admit you have some top-quality gaming caliber!\" Oh boy, little did Sieg know what he had stirred there. I'm a sucker for playful challenges and a serial solo runner who needs but the slightest excuse to tackle new Pokemon solo runs; and once I read that tongue-in-cheek suggestion, there was simply no turning back, and I was more than thrilled to take up the gauntlet and dive head first into that new and most unexpected endeavour.Mind you, I did my homework beforehand. Endurtaking exciting challenges is all well and nice, but I had to make sure that a Roggenrola solo run was even possible at all before digging up my cartridge of Black 2 from my precious collection. I pored over the little rock's Stats on Bulbapedia; and lo and behold, it turned out that Roggenrola actually had a couple of cards up his sleeve stat-wise — cards that could make him more than fit for cruising solo. For one thing, he boasts a stellar Attack stat, which means guaranteed one-shooting; for another, he's blessed with high Defense and loads of HP, which allows him to be a damage sponge and take hits comfortably. This automatically took care of the cute geode's crippling weakness, i.e. his abysmal Speed stat: even though I never got to act first in battle, I would still be able to stomach my opponent's hit before unleashing my own devastating moves. Last but not least, Roggenrola's Sturdy ability ensured that my little rock would never be one-shot at the beginning of a battle. There was definitely some potential there, and good hopes that I could indeed succeed and pull off a Roggenrola Solo Run. As you probably guessed already, I did indeed succeed and took my Roggenrola — affectionately renamed Geode — all the way up to the Elite Four and beyond. And guess what? It wasn't even that hard. In fact, I dare say my Roggenrola Solo Run was easier than my Snivy run of White 2 and my Rowlet and Litten runs of Sun. That was wildy unexpected — all the more so as I didn't even get to benefit from Roggenrola's final evolution, which can only be triggered through Trading — and believe me, I relished the surprise and the whole ride that came in its wake. Despite Roggenrola's many elemental weaknesses, I was never in real trouble in any of the Gyms — nor in the Elite Four, for that matter: my ample amounts of HP and sky-high Defense allowed me to take damage while biding my time, and a couple of Battle Items took care of padding my Geode's lousy Sp. Defense when necessary. Cherry on the cake, Geode managed to overcome his natural limitations on the Speed front through overleveling: in the late stages of the games, I got to strike first in roughly one third of all battles, which was a most pleasant development. Now obviously, I did endure a lot of first hits and thus a lot of damage through that run; but that gave me the opportunity to stock up on healing items and use my mountains of cash, which usually remain mostly untouched during my runs. On the Move side, I spent most of the game wielding Rock Smash (Fight), Return (Normal), Bulldoze (Ground) and Rock Slide (Rock) and managed to take care of all battles situations with that powerful quatuor of Physical awesomeness. Rock 'Mons may have a lot of weaknesses allright, but there are sure many Types that are weak to Rock in return: Rock Slide was by far my most used move, a terrific one-shooter that could send Flying and Dragon 'Mons crashing to the ground just as readily as knock out Ghost and Psychic 'Mons into oblivion.  So you have it: the unlikeliest solo run of them all, presented by yours truly and kickstarted by a playful comment. This is actually the second time a comment by Sieg prompts me to undertake a Pokemon solo run I would never have thought of in the first place, and I'm starting to think that we share some kind of cosmic Pokemon connection. At any rate, here's to you, Sieg: a solo run that proves once more that valid candidates for Pokemon solo runs come in all shapes and sizes and that even the occasional crappy, crippling stat can be overcome when the rest of the numbers are in all the right places. And now, after four solo runs in a row, I'm taking a break from Black and White 2 — but not from the series. I still have a couple of runs to get out of my system right now, and I'll keep gorgeoing on Pokemon until my itch is fully scratched. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Me and Final Fantasy VII", "date": "25/06/2017", "text": "Every RPG aficionado as well as any gamer born before 1985 has a story to tell about Final Fantasy VII, a.k.a. the game that single-handedly introduced the mainstream gaming scene of two continents to the joys of JRPG. As Square Enix is cooking up a remake of this beloved cult classic and we're about to come full circle twenty years after the original game's release, it's now time for me to unfold my personal story about FFVII. There will be hype, there will be hope, and there will be unrequited love grown cold. Make yourselves comfortable and grab some popcorn, dear fellow gamers: for what you're about to read is the bittersweet story of how I totally and utterly missed on FFVII.  Let's rewind all the way back to 1997. Summer 1997, to be more precise. To say that this was an underwhelming gaming summer for me would definitely be an understatement. At that point, I had milked my Game Gear library dry and squeezed every possible ounce of fun from the system; and since no new games were being released, I had nothing left to hope for on the Sega portable front. My Game Boy was long gone, sold to a second-hand store a couple of years before in order to get the necessary funds to purchase my Game Gear; as for my beloved second-hand Megadrive, it would only come into the picture a couple of months later. In a nutshell, I was stranded with no games to play and immediate gaming prospects looked pretty dire.In a desperate attempt to stay connected to gaming, I decided to acquire the summer issue of a now long-defunct gaming magazine. This was definitely not an usual move for me at the time: far from being the avid game magazine reader I am nowadays, I carefully shied away from all these colourful tomes bristling with hype-inducing pictures and over-assuming titles that could best be described as the ancestors of today's clickbaits. There were two reasons for this avoidance: the first was that these magazines were quite expensive, and I hardly had enough pocket money to purchase games, let alone magazines about games. The second reason was that at the time, I was still dreaming of acquiring a home console and actively lobbying my parents to let me hook a machine to the home TV; and while the deed was not done, reading enthusiastic articles about the latest home console releases would only have poured salt in the wound. But these two very sound reasons to stay away from gaming magazines virtually evaporated that summer, wiped away by my overwhelming desire to indulge in something—anything—related to gaming.So I purchased this magazine, whose name I cannot remember for the life of me. Not that I cared at all about that at the time, mind you; the only thing I was craving and caring about were the contents. And boy, did I got more than I bargained for. For lo and behold, dear fellow gamers: somewhere in this holy magazine, between an El-Hazard poster and cheesy readers' letters, was nested a full-fledged feature about the upcoming Final Fantasy VII.I remember that piece like I read it yesterday, dear fellow gamers. A complete survey of FFVII's storyline and cast of characters, replete with gorgeous full-colour pictures. Cloud, Barret, Tifa, Aerith, Rouge 13: they were all displayed there in all their official art glory, and they all looked impossibly cool and edgy. Like, cooler and edgier than any other videogame character created since the dawn of gaming. And gosh, how hard did I want to grab a controller and swing that impossibly huge sword around.Of course, this wouldn't have been possible at all, since FFVII is a turn-based RPG; but that was not something you could infer from the article's content. The whole piece was solely focused on the narrative, with little to no mention of the type of gameplay involved. Even more revealing, there was not a single gameplay picture to be found in these FFVII-soaked pages: the many pictures that adorned the article were either the official art or screen captures lifted from cutscenes. Over the years, I've learnt to despise that gaming advertising angle that focuses on character fan-service and does away with gameplay footage; but during that summer '97, I was totally unfazed by this lack of gameplay information and lapped up the whole thing, all the more so as my anime obsession was at its peak at the time.To say that I was enthralled by this article would once again be an jolly understatement. This was the first time ever I was hearing about that game, and what I read pretty much glued me to the magazine. To put it simply, this brand-new RPG looked like the most amazing, mind-blowing, breathtaking game of all times to my younger eyes. I was ferociously hyped up, and my level of hype climber higher with every reread of that FFVII feature that had become akin to a sacred text for the younger, game-starved little me. I wanted to play that game with every fibre of my being, and my body and soul ached at the thought that it would probably never happen.Because indeed, things were pretty complicated between the Playstation and me at the time. For one thing, I had already grown to dislike Sony's first gaming piece of kit for its ugly blocky 3D and shitty shades of brown by the time I discovered that fateful FFVII feature, and it would take more than one appetizing game to make me change my opinion of the system. But the most damning reason I would not get to play FFVII in the near future was that there was no way I could own a Playstation in said near future. Even if my parents gave me the green light to purchase a home console the very next day, the Playstation was way beyond my financial means. It would have taken months and months of saving my pocket money to garner the funds required to purchase a Playstation and a copy of FFVII; and young little me had already been through that whole process with the Game Boy and was not in the mood to repeat the deed with the Playstation. Especially when there was no guarantee whatsoever that I would find any game to play beyond FFVII.And so did FFVII pass me by at the time of its release. I could still have played it a couple of years later, mind you; I was a mere couple of years away from adulthood in 1997, and I could perfectly have gotten my paws on a second-hand Playstation and a copy of FFVII when I moved into my first flat. However, I rather choose to dabble in emulation and anime marathons at the time, and FFVII slowly but surely slipped out of my radar as years went by.To this day, I still have to play FFVII. But you know what? I really don't want to. Not only did I lose every last shred of interest for the game over the years, but I'm pretty sure that I would be sorely disappointed if I tried my hand at Square's most famous RPG ever. For one thing, it didn't exactly age gracefully: I encountered some actual gameplay footage for the first time a couple of years ago and was appaled by the sheer ugliness of what I saw—not that cutscenes are any better, mind you. But most importantly, FFVII has become such a perennial and absolute cult classic over time that even while gradually losing interest in the game, I've absorbed all the praise about it and unconsciously developed expectations. And without nostalgia to make the heart grow fonder, those expectations are bound to not be met and I'm bound to be disappointed by FFVII.So, I'd rather let gaming legends rest undisturbed. There is a time for everything, and there's no time but the right time; and the right time to play FFVII is over as far as I'm concerned. And since it's also highly unlikely that I'll ever play the remake, FFVII will forever remain my main teenage years gaming fantasy and The Cult Classic RPG That Passed Me By. I've been passionate about that game, desperately greedy for it and bitter not to get to play it; but nowadays, FFVII is nothing more than a bittersweet memory of those years when I was starved of games and a reminder that I have it really freakin' good nowadays when it comes to gaming abundance. And now that I've unrolled my own private FFVII story for you, dear fellow gamers, I fervently encourage you to humour my insatiable gaming curiosity by doing the same in the comments. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon White 2: The Flareon Solo Run", "date": "19/06/2017", "text": "Here it comes at last! My long-awaited Eevee solo run, which I kept delaying to have fun and experiment with the Unova Starters. After I got this out of my system, I was able to focus on the cute little fox at last and put it to the solo run test. I've been curious about Eevee's performance on the battlefield for the longest time, ever since I discovered him in my aborted Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team playthrough; but alas, that versatile creature is not exactly ubiquitous in Pokemon entries. Not only can I count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I stumbled upon a wild Eevee in my Pokemon runs, but the adorable fox also has a way of appearing really late in the games, making him a somewhat unfit candidate for solo endeavours. After a lot of research and an inspired suggestion from faithful reader Kumiko, it appeared that the Black 2/White 2 pair offered the best setting for an Eevee solo run, with Eevee himself being available for recruitment right after the second Gym and various Stones being ready for the taking not too far after that. And thus I started my long-awaited Eevee solo run in bucolic automnal Unova, eager to see what magic the kawaii creature could work on the battlefield.I'll be blunt: my lovely female Eevee, affectionately renamed Eeveeta (I usually suck at choosing 'Mons' nicknames, but I'm quite proud of that one), blew away virtually all my expectations. I never thought a mere Normal 'Mon could pack that much punch — which shows once again that my relative inexperience in all things Pokemon generates plenty of big fat stereotypes that only beg to be quashed through multiple playthroughs. I feared I would have a hard time with Eevee's Normal form, but my worries were unwarranted: my Eeveeta's fighting performances were so stellar that I delayed her Stone-triggered evolution and cruised with her base form much longer than I initially planned. When I finally decided to make her evolve after leaving Driftveil City, I was confronted with the torturous question that probably plagues every Eevee Trainer before that important milestone: which form do I want? I only owned a Fire Stone and Thunder Stone at that point, which gave me access to two forms on top of Eevee's two \"natural\" evolutions; a bit of testing showed quickly that Flareon was the form best fitted for solo endeavours in general and for my run in particular. The fiery fox boasts massive amounts of HP that can compensate his relatively low Defense and Sp.Defense by allowing him to be a damage sponge; as for its Attack, it's so impossibly high that I gave me good hopes I could blaze (indeedy) through the rest of Unova without a single scratch.The Attack stat was the key there, because my whole Move pool was on the Physical side. And my, what a kick-ass Move pool it was. Three Normal Moves (Return, Quick Attack and Covet) and a Dark Move (Bite) to take care of the occasional Ghost type, and I was set for pretty much the whole game. Upon entering Victory Road, I switched Quick Attack and Covet for Dig (Ground) and Firethrower (Fire) to give me a wider array of fighting options during the Elite Four showdown; and armed with this awesome Move quatuor, I proceeded to blast the whole Elite Four crew. It was mostly piece of cake, apart from Fighting Trainer Marshal, who forced me to use a battery of Battle Items for the first and only time in the whole game. The Champion's Dragon 'Mons, on the other hand, couldn't sustain the combined assault of my overpowered Moves, which happened to target their weaknesses to a T in what I can only describe as a giant stroke of luck. And so was I crowned Champion after 17 delighful hours of cruising Unova with my irresistible — in every sense of the word — Eevee-turned-Flareon.Not only was my Eevee solo run pure glee from beginning to end, but it also gave me ideas for future solo runs. On one hand, experimenting with the Thunder Stone on Eevee made me realize that I yet have to attempt a solo run with a Electric 'Mon. I have two valid candidates for the job, whose identities I will keep under wraps until I do tackle solo runs with them. On the other hand, I stumbled upon a 'Mon that delighted my retinas so much that I nearly gave up my Eevee solo run on the spot to cruise Unova with that new recrue. I managed to restrain myself and stick to the original plan, but a solo run with that newly encountered creature that fits my Pokemon tastes to a T is definitely in order; and once again, I will keep the identity of my new crush hidden for the time being. At any rate, the Black 2/White 2 pair has inspired me beyond my wildest expectations. A mere couple of months ago, I was ready to swear these games off after discovering that they sported the same starters as Black/White; and here I am now, cruising them like there's no tomorrow and loving them more by the solo run. There will definitely be more 5th generation action on that blog, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Black 2: The Serperior Solo Run", "date": "07/06/2017", "text": "After my delightful Tepig solo run, I decided to put the 5th generation Grass starter to the test. I would lie if I said I had great hopes about Snivy's performance on the battlefield: from what I've read and heard, this is a 'Mon that doesn't pack a lot of punch and lacks a bit on the Stats side. However, I liked the looks of the serpentine starter, and I wanted to see for myself how it fared in a solo run setting.I can say right away that the rumours were indeed true: Snivy is far from being a stellar fighter. He has low HP as well as low Attack and Sp. Attack, and his Defense and Sp. Defense stats can be described as average at best. On the other hand, he boasts sky-high Speed; but this was useless as far as my solo run was concerned, since over-leveling is usually enough to give my One and Only the upper hand — and thus the opportunity to strike first — in nearly all solo run battles. Snivy also suffers from an affliction I've come to hate, i.e. Ridiculously Restricted Move Pool. The poor snake can only learn Grass and Normal offensive Moves by leveling up; and since TMs are a bit of a pain to uncover in the 5th generation entries, I spent my whole run spamming the same moves — namely Leaf Blade (Grass), Return (Normal), Slam (Normal) and Giga Drain (Grass). Mind you, that Move diet wouldn't have been an issue at all had the Moves in question been stellar; but unfortunately, that Move quatuor was far from being satisfactory. Not only had most of these moves low PP and poor accuracy (except for my beloved Return, which never fails me in solo runs), but because of Snivy's pathetic Attack and Sp. Attack, they failed more often than not to one-shoot opponents, even with the benefit of over-leveling. As a result, battles dragged on and I routinely found myself out of PP for my moves, which forced me to backtrack to Pokemon centers way to often for my taste.Indeedy.After roughly eight hours spent plodding through the estival version of Unova, one thing suddenly dawned on me: I was not enjoying myself. That Snivy solo run was not downright impossible or even torturous, but it was tedious enough to eradicate most of the fun I usually derive from playing Pokemon entries as a lone ranger. Given the size of my precious game collection and the sheer number of Pokemon solo runs I still want to polish off, I had absolutely no time to lose in a playthrough I was not fully relishing; and thus I gave up on my Snivy solo run, leaving my Lv. 59 Serperior to rest in Lacunosa Town. Guess he'll stay there for all eternity, because I'm not planning to resume that run and burden myself with the serpentine Grass starter again any time soon.Since I don't have much more to say about my aborted Snivy solo run, I'll use the opportunity to point out a couple of details that routinely irritate me in my Pokemon runs. The time is ripe to mention them; because the more entries I play, the more these details irk me. Low and behold, here are the joy-killers:Not having my 'Mons' HP refilled when they gain a level. Every single RPG under the gaming sun does that, so why not Pokemon? This makes even less sense given the overall forgiving and player-friendly vibe of the series. So I can restore my 'Mons' health for free as many times as I want, but the usual complimentary HP refill after leveling up is off limits? That's really stingy, GameFreak. Stat-raising items having no effect after my 'Mons' Stats rise beyond a given limit. Now, this really infuriates me, because it's completely unfair and uncalled for. Isn't it my right to lavish all the Zincs, Carbos and Proteins I uncover on a single 'Mon if I want to? This is all the more stupid as there are other ways to raise Stats independently from leveling up, such as IV and EV training. Good thing Rare Candies keep working no matter how high your 'Mons' levels are — that's the silver lining on this cloud of skewed limitations. Not being able to sell TMs. I understand that this was implemented to protect players from themselves and to make sure that they wouldn't go on a TM selling spree only to regret it afterwards; but to be honest, I find this a bit patronizing. Unused TMs have a way of cluttering one's inventory, and I wish there were a way to get rid of them for good. There should be other ways to prevent players from selling TMs by mistake or to address second thoughts, such as double-checking is the player is sure during the selling process or implementing a shop in which all sold TMs can be purchased again. Now that this is out of the way, I can wrap up this post. I'm glad I gave the 5th generation resident Grass starter a chance; and although he ultimately failed to enrapture me, we still had some pleasant hours cruising Unova together. And now I can enthusiastically move on to other Pokemon solo runs; I still have my long-awaited Eevee solo run to tackle, and I sure hope that the adorable versatile fox won't disappoint me. Stay tuned for more Black 2 and White 2 goodness, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon White 2: The Emboar Solo Run", "date": "30/05/2017", "text": "Summer is the ideal time to play Pokemon as far as I'm concerned. Never mind the fact that I spent two months glued to Sun and Moon just a couple of weeks ago; the gaming instinct wants what it wants, and it wanted some furry action. And so I dug up my still unplayed cartridge of White 2 from my precious collection and started yet another solo run. My initial plan involved an Flareon solo run, since both Eevee and the Fire Stone can be obtained quite early on in White 2; but destiny and my ever- dependable gaming instinct had other plans in store for me. See, I chose Tepig as my starter as a half-joke, naming him \"Bacon\" to understrike the humorous charge of that move; but as I played the game, I became unexpectedly attached to the piglet. He doesn't look half as bad as rumour has it, and he certainly packs a punch and rocks on the battlefield. When time came to recruit an Eevee and get the Fire Stone, I was so enamoured with the porcine starter that I couldn't bear the though of dropping him; and that's how my Eevee solo run was shelved and became a de facto Tepig solo run.And my, what a great run it was. The pacing was amazing, brisk and sharp without feeling rushed; and the leveling-up speed was out of this world. I reached Lv. 30 after barely 3 hours of play, folks! Now that's how I love my Pokemon solo runs to be: fast-paced and with lightning-fast leveling-up. Clocking at 14:30 hours, my Tepig solo run was probably one of my shortest Pokemon solo runs ever; but there was still plenty to do during that time. I loved the fact that I got to tackle Unova in a completely different order from the one that was imposed in Black and White; that gave me a totally new and fresh vision of the region and make me feel like I was playing a different game that still felt pleasantly familiar. It was also a great idea to leave some towns out of the mandatory path, to be explored at leisure during postgame; it made the game more compact and the pacing swifter. All in all, I felt like I was cruising a brand-new Unova, glossier and shinier than the original, like a fresh doughnut covered with glaze. (Look at me, trying to sneak in an all-American metaphor to square with the Unova setting. This has totally nothing to do with the fact that I've been introduced to the heavenly Original Glazed Doughnut by Krispy Kreme lately and have been obsessed with it ever since, oh no.) My lovely little Bacon did a great job in all things fighting, one-shooting his way to the Elite Four and generally treating all other 'Mons like insignificant obstructions. He was Lv. 91 when I finally reached the Champion; and suffice it to say that the whole Elite Four showdown was a mere formality. Bacon managed to one-shot most of his opponents, including the Champion's six 'Mons. Poor girl didn't even get to use a Max Potion or a Full Restore! But hey, my Tepig-turned-Emboar was just too formidable. For the record, my move pool during the second half of the game was Arm Thrust (Fighting), Return (Normal), Bulldoze (Ground) and Flamethrower (Fire); an efficient and varied quartet that allowed me to take care of pretty much all battle situations. I didn't bother taking Nature into account this time around — heck, I didn't even bother checking my Tepig's Nature. Experience has taught me that as far as Starters in older generations are concerned, Nature doesn't matter that much; these guys will always get an overwhelming edge in solo runs regardless of their Nature.Only one thing rubbed me the wrong way in that otherwise delightful and fulfilling run, and that thing can be summed up in one sentence: my Trainer is a total PUSHOVER. Absolutely everybody in that game is bossing me around: Hugh, Alder, Professor Juniper, Colress, Cheren, and even airhead Bianca. Heck, even my own mum is sending me on the road after a couple of expeditive questions with the words \"your course of action has been set\" as an goodbye. Wait, set by whom? Don't I have a say in the matter? But that's only the beginning: Hugh, my supposed rival, treats me like a mere tool to serve his own purpose. He doesn't even see me as a genuine rival: sure, he fights me, but to quote his own words, that's only to make sure that I'm 'strong enough to back him up'. Back. Him. Up. Huh, excuse me?! Am I not supposed to be the bloody hero here? Is that game not supposed to be about me and my epic quest to Catch 'Em All and become the strongest Trainer that ever lived? And the infamy doesn't stop here, oh nooo. Professor Juniper doesn't even have the decency to invite me to her lab and treat me to pats on the back and words of encouragement like basically every other Pokemon professor since the dawn of the series; instead, she sends her assistant Bianca to boss me around. Erm, could you actually care less about my endeavours? I met Professor Juniper once throughout the whole game, only to have her throw a few vague words of praise at my face and then run away like she couldn't bear the thought of being seen with me. Then Hugh bossed me around some more, always sending me on the front line while he stayed safely on the rear, only to pop up as I was about to polish off a dungeon and claim all the glory for himself. Oh, and don't even think of tackling the Elite Four before Hugh allows you to do so: never mind the fact that you have reaped all eight Badges, you have to help him reach his goal first. Because, you know, he's apparently the bloody Hero here, not you. Cherry on the humiliation cake, people routinely compare you to 'that great Trainer from two years ago', who is none other that the Black/White Trainer. A Trainer who got the privilege to be the Hero of their own game, unlike you. Looks like the '2' in the game's title refers to my Trainer's station in life just as much as to the fact that this game is a sequel, indeed! Seriously, I felt more like a bellboy than like a Pokemon Trainer in White 2, and I didn't like it one bit. That game didn't revolve around my heroic personal quest like all other Pokemon entries; it revolved entirely around the stories and endeavours of NPCs, with me at their beck and call, slaving away to serve their objectives. Sheesh, I guess I should be glad this bunch of bullies even allowed me to tackle the Gyms and the Elite Four at all instead of keeping me on a leash or something.  Playing second fiddle aside, this was a jolly good solo run that helped me reassess the fifth generation as a whole and its Starters in particular. I dismissed them as first glance; but as time goes on, I find them more and more interesting. I was already quite fond of Oshawott, and Tepig has become a new favourite over the course of that solo run; and I have to admit that I'm now genuinely interested in tackling a Snivy solo run. Oh, and my initially planned Eevee solo run is not forsaken, obviously. I still crave some Pokemon action after this delectable Tepig solo run and I have yet to play Black 2, so expect at least one more run report very soon. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "R-Type: Too little, too late", "date": "23/05/2017", "text": "The face that launched a lifelong longing.Just like Super Mario Land, Balloon Kid and Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle, R-Type belonged to the first wave of games released on the Game Boy. I remember encountering some promotional material that featured a screen capture of the first boss and becoming curiously enthralled by this image; so much so, in fact, that staring at that tentacular creature created a deep longing to play R-Type in my young soul. Alas, that was not meant to be: for some unfathomable reason, R-Type was never available in the local game stores and I never encountered anyone who owned it. And so was Irem's famous horizontal shooter the first game to join the list of Games That Passed Me By, a list that was soon to grow to epic proportions. But I digress.Anyway, since my collecting endeavours are partially fuelled by a desire to make up for lost time and (re)discover potential cult classics that I missed out on or didn't get to play enough, it was perfectly natural that I would purchase a copy of R-Type at some point. I wanted to play that game at long last and see if it was the fascinating and riveting game young little me thought it was at the time. The answer? Yes and no. While there's no doubt that I would have lapped up R-Type in 1991 and would have played it over and over again until I managed to eradicate the last boss, I simply can't bring myself to try to reach said last boss nowadays. Heck, I can't even bring myself to play the damn game at all, period.As you may imagine, these conflicting perceptions can be solely blamed on the gameplay. R-Type is an arcadey game with an unreasonable difficulty level: four lives, two continues, no saving system and last but not least, a spacecraft that explodes at the slightest contact with foes, bullets, and even the ground or the ceiling. What is that ship made off, cardboard? And I'm supposed to obliterate the evil Bydo Empire single-handedly with such a crappy piece of kit? Not only is R-Type unreasonably difficult, but it is also a pure Die-and-Retry game that requires perfect knowledge of the level layouts to be navigated. Add to this a clunky and slow control scheme, and you get a game that's way too hard for its own good and bound to scare away any gamer who's not a complete masochist. Now, young me would have taken up the gauntlet without batting an eyelid; but older me knows that clearing that game is a lost cause and that there are more rewarding games out there. And that's precisely the core issue with R-Type: this game is not rewarding at all unless one pours countless hours of play into it. The punishing difficulty and unsatisfying controls rob the potential player of instant gratification, and the arcade, no-saving nature of the game prevents any sort of delayed gratification from occurring. The only way one can enjoy R-Type is by playing it until they know it like the back of their hand, after which they may derive some gratification from being able to navigate the game unhindered.In a nutshell, R-Type comes 25 years too late into my gaming life. Its exacting and unforgiving gameplay would have been perfectly acceptable in 1991, both for me and for the gaming scene at large; however, both me and the gaming scene simply cannot accept such a grueling and punishing game in 2017. R-Type is interesting and relevant as a piece of gaming history; but as a game, it's better left in the depths of the Game Boy library and the early '90s where it belongs. Playing that game taught me one crucial thing: gaming fashions come and go and there's a time for every type of gameplay, and some games must rest undisturbed lest they give the unsuspecting played a massive culture shock.

{"title": "Collector's delight: My (second to) last special edition", "date": "17/05/2017", "text": "As I mentioned before, I'm getting a bit burnt on collector's editions; hence my decision to stop purchasing these alluring yet ultimately disappointing items. I'm not planning to fork out an extra buck for the upcoming special editions of Culdcept Revolt and RPG Maker Fes; instead, I'll wisely go for regular copies with no dust-collecting memorabilia included. However, despite my vows to stop lavishing money on these space-consuming packages, I lately found myself purchasing one Special completely out of the blue, and for the most unlikely game ever. What I purchased is none other than the Japanese special edition of Ore no Shikabane o Koete Yuke 2, better known as Oreshika 2.There are two reasons for that unlikely and unexpected purchase. The first is that this package was dirt cheap; since the game was panned by many a Japanese player, affordable Japanese copies are abundant — including copies of this special edition, which are trending around 40-50 bucks. The second and most important reason is that this Special is incredibly well curated. Granted, its contents don't fulfill my ultimate criterion for the purchase of collector's editions, i.e. to improve on the game experience and/or add something significant to the gameplay; but on the other hand,we're dealing with items that are actually useful for a change, and quite gorgeous to boot. No dust collectors here: what we have is a hand strap, a (very large) cleaning cloth, a pouch and a set of skins, all boasting really lovely patterns. In a word, a full set to pimp up your Vita and make it the ultimate Oreshika machine.Not only is it rare to find such a cohesive and carefully chosen set of items in a collector's edition, but said items are also arranged quite neatly and orderly. They are actually housed in a separate box, each one having its own little compartment; that separate box inserts smoothly into the main box, with the game itself nicely nested on the side. This is a nice change from most special editions, in which items are either thrown willy-nilly into the box or squeezed into it to such a point that it's nearly impossible to slide them back in once you took them out.As a whole, this is a Special that was obviously crafted and put together with love and care; and just for that reason, it's perfectly worth owning. Sony went the extra mile to offer original collectables instead of sticking to the old OST or flimsy 30-page artbook seen in virtually every collector's edition under the gaming sun, and that effort must be praised. I'm quite content I got my paws on this Special — which, as I mentioned in the title, is not going to be my last, but rather my second to last collector's edition. Before I stop purchasing these overpriced collections of memorabilia for good, I absolutely want to make mine the special edition of Ys: Lacrimosa of Dana, which is shaping up to be a thing of beauty and a Special totally worth purchasing. Until then, I'll gladly stick to regular editions and rub my hands at the thought of all the money I'm saving. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Balloon Kid: Gone with the wind", "date": "08/05/2017", "text": "Balloon Kid was not my Xth Game Boy game; instead, it belonged to my sister, who undoubtedly bought it based on its cute premise. A game starring a little girl floating around and collecting balloons had to be adorable and heart-warming, right? Heck, NO. A million times no. Forget Balloon Kid's lovely gameplay proposition: this is an exacting and nerve-racking Platformer that packs all the nastiness and viciousness of Nintendo Hard NES games and sneaks it into the Game Boy under the most misleading kawaii guise imaginable. Just like her namesake, Alice is in for a most unpleasant trip — and so is the player who controls her. Or tries to; but more on that very soon.Die, you stupid fish.\"Platformer\" is too simplistic a term to describe little Alice's aerial adventures, actually. Just like fellow 1990er Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle, Balloon Kid is a game that blends several playing styles and is unafraid to experiment with gameplay mechanics. If there were ever such a thing as a hardcore Platformer without platforms, then BK is that game: it requires an insane amount of focus, sangfroid and precision to be navigated properly, which ironically makes it a somewhat unfit proposition for its kiddy target audience. It's also a weird floating/hovering simulator that requires constant player input. Alice doesn't fly on her own and sinks like a stone lest the A button is diligently pressed; then, constant height and speed adjustments must be made to make her go beyond obstacles. The game's physics are extremely consistent and cohesive and are actually quite stellar for the time; but they are also really hard to master, all the more so as they can be counter-intuitive even to the most seasoned Platformer aficionado. Alice is floating around, which means that there is a certain inertia at work in all her moves; and that parameter must be taken into account at all times, which generally involves a high degree of move planning. BK also packs a distinctive Die-and-Retry flavour: level layouts are always the same, down to enemy placements, and they must be learnt by heart to be navigated safely. There are also more random and outlandish gameplay elements at work, such as the highly unusual right-to-left scrolling (I don't think I ever encountered another Platformer that makes the player crawl levels that way, and that scrolling sometimes feel downright counter-intuitive), the fact that screen boundaries act like physical objects and can be used to rebound or the fact that bosses must usually be beaten by resorting to Alice's seldom-used ground move pool, whose physics are downright wonky. Balloon Kid is also the most striking illustration ever of the \"Perfect And Encompassing Level 1 That Makes All Subsequent Levels Pointless\" (a concept that can also be found in the original Sonic and its lush Green Hill Zone); in fact, I seriously suspect that BK single-handedly created that very concept. The first level of that game is a monument of wholesomeness and heart-warming perfection, with whimsical graphics, a lovely and highy evocative theme track and a pitch-perfect balance between challenge and fun. This first level is the one that draw me back to the game time and time again as a kid; had BK started right with its gloomy second level, I'm not sure I would have bothered replaying it even once. Now obviously, that first level is also a big fat lie, because it's in no way representative of the game as a whole; and yet, it somehow feels more perfect and fulfilling than all the other levels combined. Talk about burning all your ammo before the fight even starts.Although BK is a very good game for its time and the hardware it was released on and still holds up pretty well to this day, it suffers from a variety of shortcomings that prevents it from reaching a cult classic status. For one thing, it's painfully linear and streamlined, with little room for gameplay variety and improvements. I blame this linearity solely on the automatic scrolling; the presence of such a feature implies that no matter how well the player masters BK, playthroughs will always last roughly the same amount of time and unfold in the exact same way. Player performance has virtually no impact on the game beyond making sure that the last boss will be reached, and that destroys most of BK's potential replay value. Then, there is the burning issue of the gameplay being skin-deep only: once you peel off BK's difficulty, which is sometimes so insane that it makes the game look like a parody of Nintendo Hard NES games, you're left with very little to sink your teeth into. At its core, BK is really nothing more than a giant, glorified QTE: you're at the game's beck and call, floating around in a virtual gameplay void and trying to stay alive by working your way around a vast array of fixed hazards. And once again, there is very little replay value to be found once you've successfully learnt to circumvent said vast array of fixed hazards. Despite BK's lack of depth and infuriating difficulty, I found myself purchasing it not once, but twice over the course of my gaming career: the first time was when I was a teenager and wanted to own my own copy of the game and try my hardest to finish it (for the record, I failed), and the second time was a couple of years ago for collection's sake. I can polish off Balloon Kid without too much hassle these days, although it's far from being a personal cult classic; but I still deem it highly valuable as another snapshot of 1990s gaming with an interesting potpourri of gameplay features and a widely unusual gameplay premise. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Nintendo 3DS: Is this love again? ", "date": "02/05/2017", "text": "Something peculiar and unexpected happened lately: the 3DS crawled back in my good graces, slowly but surely. In fact, I don't think I've ever loved the system as much as I love it right now: I'm immensely hyped up about games to come and I found a renewed interest for my 3DS library, which I want to explore and enjoy at leisure. This could be due to the mere-exposure effect: as a new — and not immediately enticing as far as I'm concerned — piece of kit is coming, the older and more familiar console suddenly seems much more reassuring and attractive. Or it could be due to my uncanny passion for systems that are about to go retro; but whatever the reason, I am indeed smitten with the 3DS like never before.And why wouldn't I be smitten, after Nintendo announced the imminent release of two shiny and brand-new models of 2DS? The collector in me leaped in joy when discovering these two sleek beauties; needless to say, said sleek beauties buried my resolution to stop purchasing more 3DS iterations on the spot. I must get my paws on this pair when they reach European shores, all the more so as they are deliciously unexpensive and look temptingly comfortable to play.To my utter joy, these revamped 2DS won't come alone, as a number of appetizing game offerings are slated for release in the months to come. We already had the newly released Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns, the soon-to-be-released Fire Emblem Echoes and the to-be-released-at-some-point Fire Emblem Heroes to scratch our 3DS itch this year; but along them is coming a bunch of unexpected, last-minute localizations. RPG Maker FES, Culdcept Revolt, Yo-kai Watch 2 and Monster Hunter Stories are all on their way to our shores, and I'm totally thrilled about them. Ever Oasis has a definite release date at long last, and Dragon Quest XI's international unleashing shouldn't be too far either. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if 2017 had more 3DS localizations in the pipeline than 2016 despite the recent arrival of the Switch!Even better, some mouth-watering 3DS games are being developed as I'm writing this very post. Those coveted games are Etrian Mystery Dungeon 2 (roguelikey dungeon crawler goodness!), Shin Megami Tensei: Deep Strange Journey (more dungeon crawler goodness!!) Layton's Mystery Journey, Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology and The Alliance Alive. I'm particularly pumped up about that last game, which is being pitched as a \"new classic RPG\" and  a \"spiritual successor\" to The Legend of Legacy — one of 2016's highlights as far as my gaming resumé is concerned. Needless to say, I'm ridiculously hyped up about all these games and I pray daily for their localization. And if they don't come to our shores, then be it; they'll be fodder for my Japanese 3DS, because there's no way I'm letting these gaming nuggets pass me by. Heck, I don't think I've been that excited about prospective RPG releases since the beginning of the 3DS era.This situation is all the more delightful as it is totally unexpected, especially in light of the way previous Nintendo systems exited the gaming scene. As the Switch made its grand debut, I fully expected Nintendo to ditch the 3DS line-up like a stone and developers to flock en masse to the shiny new machine; but lo and behold, the Big N is instead treating us to a brand-new model and developers are crafting exciting games as we're speaking! This is definitely a first for a Nintendo system as far as transitions from one console generation to the next are concerned, and one could actively speculate about the reasons behind such a situation. Does Nintendo want to pamper 3DS aficionados and thank them for their unwavering support? Are developers still uncertain about the long-term prospects of the Switch? Does everybody think there is still good money to be made with the 3DS? All of this at once? It doesn't matter to us portable aficionados, really: what matters is that the 3DS is still alive and well and exciting games are coming our way. With such a thrilling 3DS release schedule ahead of us, I have renewed hopes for a future localization of Etrian Odyssey V, or even a possible Untold remake of Etrian Odyssey III. Bring it on, Atlus!Here's to a glorious year for Nintendo's dedicated handheld, which is pleasantly defying expectations and proving to be a survivor indeed! I sure hope you're as thrilled about these unexpected 3DS developments as I am, dear fellow gamers, and that you have as many games — and maybe even a shiny new 2DS XL — on your Coveted Games List as I have right now. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Luminous Arc: That's a wrap", "date": "26/04/2017", "text": "So, did I manage to pull off an Alph solo run of Luminous Arc? Well, sort of. I sure blazed through the second half of the game, polishing off twelve chapters in a mere four hours; and Alph was pretty much my sole asset on the battlefield. I occasionally took a couple of extra party members along for the ride; but being the under-levelled wimps they were, they usually died in a couple of turns, leaving Alph alone to finish the job. Not that it was a problem, mind you; my Lv. 99 Alph was more than strong enough to take care of any foe, and so I managed to reach the final boss without hassle. It was smooth, it was nice, and it was definitely fun.The final boss battle, on the other hand, is none of these things. It's a nasty difficulty spike of Eiger proportions; and for the first time since my insane grinding marathon, I found myself in a genuine bind. Not only do the boss and his six minions hit harder than any foe before them, but they are also hell-bent on healing and buffing themselves. And since I cannot take them down in one clean hit, even with Alph's most powerful attack, I got stuck in a vicious circle of hitting them only to see them replenish their health, ruining all my efforts in the process. Add to this the necessity to heal myself on a regular basis and you get a perfect recipe for Final Fight Failure. The rest of my crew is virtually useless because of their low levels; and since I got my fill of grinding already, there is no way I'm investing a single extra minute of my time in levelling them up. And thus I'm officially giving up on Luminous Arc after 20 hours of genuinely satisfying play.That game is not perfect, obviously. Controls are infuriatingly clunky and imprecise (I actually switched to stylus controls after a couple of minutes because they were less frustrating than button controls, which speaks volumes about the poor quality of said button controls), battles are ridiculously slow, and the story is so asinine that the game would have been better off without it. I wish the options to skip all story segments had been available, because watching said story segments felt like a complete waste of time. Heck, I didn't even bother reading the text anymore after a couple of hours. I could elaborate a lot more about how characters accept new circumstances way too fast, how they are so pure and pristine while all church officials are evil and rotten to the core and how the big baddie's ultimate goal hardly makes any sense; but I'll abstain. I've already given that story much more attention than it deserves simply by enduring its unskippable cutscenes.Still, there's no denying that I had tons of fun playing Luminous Arc. This is the second SRPG in which I resort to over-levelling to break the game and enjoy myself; and I must admit that there is some kind of genuine thrill in subverting a game's rules and playing it in a way that was not intended by developers or by the genre itself. Relying on a single overlevelled character didn't fully work in Luminous Arc, but it sure took me far into the game; and had I been ready to pour a few extra hours into the game to level up a couple of units, I'm sure I could have beaten that cheated final boss and his minions without breaking a sweat. In the end, we always get back to the same point: the RPGs I love the most are the ones that give me the opportunity to play them my way, and Luminous Arc was definitely one of those. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Luminous Arc: Whatever works", "date": "21/04/2017", "text": "Boy, is it good to be reunited with my beloved DS at long last! It's been nearly a whole year since I played the system last, and the wave of giddy joy that washed over me as I rediscovered the DS' unmistakable graphical style and low-fi touch made me realize that I missed the system a whole lot. Guess I should play DS games more often then — all the more so as my DS library is by a long shot the largest of all my game libraries. But I digress. This post is not about the awesomeness of the DS, but rather about how I broke, twisted and remodeled Luminous Arc's gameplay beyond recognition in an over-enthusiastic attempt to make the game work for me. And work for me it does indeed, o yes precious.My playthrough started in a fairly normal and unremarkable way: I fought a couple of battles, noticed right away that everybody but Heath and Alph sucked big time on the battlefield, and decided thus to focus the bulk of my level-grinding efforts on the aforementioned pair and to make them my main battle assets. This worked nicely until the game viciously removed Heath from my party after a mere couple of chapters, leaving me stranded with a reasonably strong character and a bunch of under-levelled losers. Why, oh why, game? I was seriously salty after that backstabbing move, not to mention anxious about whether I would manage to progress with such an unbalanced team; fortunately, the game was kind enough to drop a couple of powerful characters into my party, allowing me to move forward without having to level-up my neglected party members. I then decided to play Luminous Arc as it was visibly intended, i.e. by using all characters and choosing the best fitted for the battle du jour.It worked well enough and I progressed unhindered until chapter 13. However, there was one tiny problem: I was bored. I didn't use most of the characters often enough to master them all in earnest and pull off genuinely satisfying strategies. Most of the time, I used only the top dogs in my team — a.k.a. the \"Fab Four\" Alph, Saki, Nikolai and Lucia — leaving the rest of the crew in their underlevelled slumber. I could have levelled up that sorry bunch and gotten used to them by abusing free battles, but Luminous Arc is so stingy when it comes to XP granted in said free battles that it would have taken a million years to get decent results. But most importantly, the fighting in Luminous Arc is so unbearably slow that attempting full-party deployment will quickly turn into a complete torture for anyone who isn't a Zen monk. The more characters involved, the snappier the fighting system: this is an unwritten rule that all RPGs should abide to lest they transform into massive snoozefests.Not only was I bored, but those cursed battles were harder than I expected. My fine quartet was overlevelled to some extent; but that wasn't enough to ensure a smooth ride, and fighting was slowly but surely turning into a chore. And given that Luminous Arc consists solely of battles with fixed screens and a bit of chatting in between, being sick and bored of said battles would have made the whole game pretty pointless. That's when I decided to break the mold and treat myself to a bit of easy grinding by crawling back on the world map until I reached a free battle point where foes where so undelevelled that I could take them down in one hit. And since I wasn't sure how long Saki, Nikolai and Lucia would stick around, I decided that Alph would be the sole beneficiary of my grinding efforts.At first, I solely wanted to unwind and grind a couple of levels in a relaxing environment; but things took a different turn after I fought a few battles and realized how unbalanced the XP gain dynamics were. To put it simply, defeating strong foes gives too little XP and defeating weak foes gives too much XP. Not only that, but there is actually a minimum amount of XP given for killing a foe, regardless of your character's and the foe's levels. That amount is 6 XP; and it never gets any lower than that, even if your character towers at Lv. 99 and the foe crawls at Lv. 1. Combine this to the fact that the number of XP required to gain a level is precisely 100 and never varies, and you get the perfect set-up for a mammoth grinding marathon and a massive breaking of the game.Heck, I'm sure you guessed what happened, dear fellow gamers. At first, I grinded a dozen of levels; then I wondered if I could grind a dozen more, just for fun. I did so, and it was so painless and pleasant that I decided to add a couple more to the mix. And then, I was hooked for good, and I just couldn't stop for the life of me. The result of that epic grinding fest can be seen on that picture: MC Alph is now Lv. 99, and I'll probably be able to blast through the rest of the game without breaking a sweat. I'm a hardcore grinding aficionado, as you all know; but I swear I never, ever planned to go that high with Alph. The fact that I got so engrossed into senseless grinding is solely due to the deliciously predictable nature of level-grinding in Luminous Arc. It took exactly the same number of foes and roughly the same amount of time to gain a level, and that regularity put me into a transe of sorts that was both relaxing and stimulating. I didn't need to put always more and more effort into climbing the level ladder, but rather the exact same amount of effort for every rung of that level ladder; and boy, was it deeply satisfying. In fact, Luminous Arc has one of the best level-grinding systems I've ever encountered, despite the imbalance of its XP gain dynamics — or maybe precisely because of them.After having completed that heavy-duty bout of grinding, I can safely claim that the developers never intended players to take party members all the way to 99. The mere fact that only the freshest foes give decent amounts of XP was probably conceived as an encouragement to forge ever on; and the existence of the XP minimum indicates that Imageepoch didn't think for one second that players would backtrack and engage in crazy level-grinding marathons. On top of that, all characters stop gaining skills and special attacks after Lv. 46, which makes me think that the crew is probably supposed to be around Lv. 45 when the final showdown unrolls. Well, guess I broke the game then. That's your fault, Imageepoch, for making level-grinding in Luminous Arc so deliciously addictive.I can now go back to the main story, and I'm really curious to see how things will unfold. Will I blast through the rest of the game, leaving a trail of burnt land and dead bodies after me? Will Alph's impossibly high levels be enough to ensure smooth victories over the many foes ahead? Will I manage to pull off a de facto solo run of Luminous Arc' second half? Well, we'll see, and very soon at that. Stay tuned for my next run report, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "A bunch of games I couldn't play", "date": "15/04/2017", "text": "To my utter dismay, I've hit a bit of a dry gaming patch lately. I've been unlucky enough to encounter not one, but three games in a row that didn't click with me and that I ditched around the three-hour mark, utterly blasé and disgusted. I'd be tempted to attribute that stroke of bad luck not to a temporary failure of my ever-dependable gaming instinct, but rather to the fact that the involved games were cheap digital-only PSN games, and such games are pretty much hit-or-miss propositions. Without further ado, here are the offenders, along with the reasons they failed to enthrall me:Vagrant Story: I grabbed that subterranean Squaresoft cult classic for a couple of euros; and at first, it seemed like an inspired purchase. I was extremely fond of that game's claustrophobic vibe, in medias res introduction à la Dark City and vaguely menacing eroticism reminiscent of '70s exploitation films; and although the gameplay first conjured horrific memories of Tomb \"Them controls are too fussy\" Raider, Vagrant Story's physics were sleek and polished enough to make me quickly forget that first impression. On the other hand, I was not so enthusiastic about the fighting system, which struck me as dreadfully boring. Instead of treating us to some hack-and-slashy goodness, Squaresoft introduced a tedious extra step in the fighting process: enemies must first be locked on, after which you have to choose the body part that will get the most damage. Whether Squaresoft chose those mechanics for the sake of being original or because automatic aiming with melee weapons was not possible at the time, said mechanics take all the urgency away from combat. On top of that, killing foes is busy work: they don't grant XP and they drop loot once in a blue moon, so you're basically killing them just to clear the way. But the dealbreaker was the fact that each weapon is efficient only against a given type of foe and that weapons must be levelled-up and switched on the fly if one wants to progress smoothly. The though of spending hours of my life levelling up weapons filled me with such dread that I wisely decided to give up on the game. I really liked Vagrant Story, but I'm not sure I can ever muster the courage to touch it again.Siralim: I had an instant crush on this game, to be honest. It boasts everything I love: nostalgia-inducing 8-bit graphics, a simple and fast-paced turn-based fighting system, randomly generated dungeons that are a joy to explore, tons of missions that give perfect incentives to roam&grind and, last but not least, the possibility to run solo. With such a perfect list of features, there was absolutely no reason for me to lose all interest in that game after a mere three hours of play, was there? And yet, that's exactly what happened, and that untimely defection can be blamed on two factors. First, the number of dungeon floors is actually infinite and there is no definitive end to the game; and that killed all my drive to crawl on the spot. If it's up to me to decide when I want to stop crawling, I might as well save myself some time and not start crawling at all, all the more so as I've never been fond of sandbox games with no grand finale: I need a goal, a challenge to keep me playing. Give your dungeon 500 floors if you want, but make it finite. Secondly and most importantly, Siralim uses level scaling, which makes level-grinding entirely pointless. This means that the only way to overcome difficulty spikes (the first one being pretty early on at floor 5) is to farm all sorts of materials to improve your weapons and spells; and I dislike farming, which I deem too random and unproductive. All in all, this game is an exercise in sheer, utter laziness. The developers dispensed themselves with implementing a balanced difficulty curve, thought-out difficulty spikes and a seamless progression towards a final boss; instead, they threw in a bunch of algorithms for random dungeon and mission generation, level scaling and difficulty spikes and called it a day. I don't see why I should play that lazy excuse for a dungeon crawler when there are dozens of better dungeon crawlers available.Bastion: This highly praised title crystallizes everything I despise about indie games. With its anaemic, simplistic and unpolished gameplay craftily hidden under a thick coating of gimmicks and edgy aesthetic choices, Bastion is the perfect illustration of the expression \"style over substance\". Alas, the game's flashiness and apparent originality wear off very quickly. The gimmick of the levels assembling themselves as you progress is just like the 3DS' 3D effect: it wows you at first, but you stop noticing it entirely after five minutes. The narrator gimmick could have been a neat one, if the developers hadn't been dumb enough to reveal said narrator's identity after ten minutes of play. The baroque, colourful art style is undeniably gorgeous, but there's so little variety to the levels that it becomes boring after a while. The story is told in a disjointed way for mystery's sake and ends up being totally incomprehensible in the process; and last but not least, the bleak atmosphere à la Limbo becomes seriously depressing after a while. All this arty varnish wouldn't be an issue if the gameplay were satisfying, which is unfortunately not the case: Bastion's real-time fighting system is sloppy, unprecise and frustrating. There are often so many mobs attacking at once that the only way to progress is to slash and shoot blindy while running around, dodging and chain-healing; and while these hectic one-against-hundreds battles are undeniably thrilling at first, they quickly become irritating. Enemies also feel a bit too insubstantial to be really pleasant to slaughter, and that's all to blame on their wobbly hitboxes. Hitboxes are everything in Action-RPGs and can make or break a real-time fighting system; in the case of Bastion, they don't utterly break the fighting system, but they certainly don't help its case either. Once I got bored of the fancy gimmicks and fully realized the gameplay's utter lack of depth, there was no more hope for Bastion and I dropped it just like its two predecessors.There's at least one good thing to be found in this series of unexciting games: if I lose access to my digital games once the PSN bails out, I won't shed a single tear for these three. Needless to say, Siralim and Bastion reinforced my natural aversion to indie games, and I don't think I'll purchase many more of these in the future. For one gem like my beloved Rainbow Moon, there are ten turds like Siralim and Bastion that rely on lazy algorithms and attention-grabbing gimmicks to get by. I have a couple of digital indies left to play, such as Titan Souls and Hotline Miami, and I wouldn't be surprised if I end up hating them as well. But hey, only play will tell! And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to dig up a REAL game from my precious collection to compensate for that festival of mediocrity. (Yeah, I know; that jibe's easy and cheap, but it feels so good). Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Super Mario Land: It's VERY complicated", "date": "30/03/2017", "text": "After having replayed Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle, I was in the mood for a retro rampage and decided to take a trip even further down memory lane by replaying The Game That Started It All: Super Mario Land, a.k.a. The First Video Game I Ever Purchased. I was an industrious kid and saved my pocket money on a regular basis, and that's how I was able to purchase a brand-new copy of SML very quickly after getting my Game Boy, saving myself from an dreary Tetris diet in the process. I cannot remember why I picked up that particular game, but I'd reckon that it was both because it was wildly advertised and because it was one of the very few Game Boy games available at the time. I didn't know what to expect from SML, but I sure hoped for the best. Alas, the best didn't come.I'll be blunt: I don't like Super Mario Land at all. Right from the start, I had this tormented, twisted and passionate relationship with it: I loathed it, and yet it lured me in time and time again. The reason for these intense feelings was pretty simple: SML was way too hard for me back then, missing the challenging mark by a couple of miles and landing straight on the infuriating mark. My father would regularly comment on the fact that I was ridiculously riled up when playing that game, that my face was so flushed he thought I was having a heart attack and that I'd better go outside to get a breath of fresh air; and mind you, I did just that more often than not. On top of introducing me to dedicated portable gaming, SML introduced me to the concept of ragequitting. I spent weeks stuck in front of King Totomesu and felt the crush of despair when fake Princess Daisy turned into a disgusting giant fly, I fell over and over again in the millions of bottomless pits littering the game, I cried tears of blood in the Chinese levels; and the only time I actually managed to reach final boss Tatanga hanging onto my last life, my nerves were so frayed that I couldn't make a move and died on its first fireball. SML required a level of platforming skill that I couldn't muster at the time, and thus it ended up being a torture tool to young little me. To make matters worse, my father was adamant that I polished off the game entirely before purchasing a second one and was hardly swayed by my teary-eyed protests that SML was just too difficult and frustrating; and while that logic made perfect sense from a parenting point of view, it was utterly absurd from my burgeoning gamer's perspective. Games were supposed to be fun, so why wasn't I allowed to ditch a game that not only failed to entertain me, but irritated me to no end every time I picked it up? But my father had the power and the car that could drive me to the toy shop standing in the next town, and thus I had to abide by his rules and spend a couple of extra weeks toiling on SML and enduring its sloppy and slippery physics, its nerve-racking boss theme and its insanely demanding platforming.Interestingly, while SML was overall a nightmarish experience for young little me, it absolutely didn't put me off gaming. On the contrary, it made me more eager than ever to tackle new games; and I think that's a testament to the vibrancy and intensity of my love for gaming. I was a yound kid, and gaming could have been just one of the many fads I embraced before ditching them without a second though; but this was something deeper and more serious, and I probably felt it at the time, if only confusely. And there I am, 27 seven years later, replaying SML and polishing it off in less than half an hour. Things sure have come a long way when it comes to my platforming abilities; but amazingly, replaying SML with a complete mastery of the gameplay was still not a pleasant experience. In fact, I felt the exact same mix of frustration, restlessness and emptiness I used to feel when I played SML as a kid, and I was so dispirited at the end of my short playthrough that I seriously considered selling my cartridge or even throwing it away. Heck, I'm still considering it.If SML didn't me make me steer clear of video games as a whole, it sure made me steer clear of the Super Mario series. And yes, I'm aware that SML is not a true blue Super Mario game, having been developed by Gunpei Yokoi instead of Shigeru Miyamoto; and that's precisely why I decided to give the series a second chance by purchasing and playing New Super Mario Bros on the DS. Did I love it? Nope, not more than its Game Boy ancestor. Well, I guess my heart just belongs to Sonic after all.In the end, my relationship with SML is still pretty complicated to this day. This was my very first game, and I have to acknowledge its importance and meaning in my gaming career; but on the other hand, I really don't like that game and don't think I ever will. So I'll probably put it to rest one way or another and wisely abstain from ever touching it again. Bad gaming memories are better left undisturbed, all the more so in a present that's brimming with fulfilling gaming experiences. I'd be curious to know what your very first game was and if it was a lacklustre experience or an amazing one, dear fellow gamers; so feel free to let me know in the comments.

{"title": "Pokemon Sun: A Nuzlocke solo run ( a.k.a. the Toucannon Solo Run )", "date": "25/03/2017", "text": "A.k.a. The Run That Opened Even More Avenues For Future Solo Runs. It all started with Sieg's innocent question in a comment: \"Will you ever try out a Nuzlocke Challenge?\" My first impulse was to answer that there was no way I'd ever go back to playing party runs in Pokemon and that as a result, the probability of me ever tackling a Nuzlocke challenge was virtually inexistent. But then I paused and asked myself: could there be a way to tweak Nuzlocke rules in order to make them work for a solo run? My interest was seriously piqued; and before I knew it, I had devised my own solo run version of the Nuzlocke Challenge, which goes as such:The solo run must be attempted with the first 'Mon captured in the very first patch of grass on Route 1. If recruitment fail during the first encounter, it has to be performed during the second encounter and so on until it succeeds, without moving from the first patch of grass. The whole run must be 100% solo, with no other 'Mon in the team. A 'Mon can be recruited only for mandatory Double Battles and must be released immediately after. As a consequence of the aforementioned rule, the use of Revives is strictly forbidden. No healing in Pokemon Centres. I was seriously pondering if I should treat fainting as death, but I decided to shelve that rule for another Nuzlocke solo run (because indeed, there will be more of these). What I wanted to achieve with that very first attempt was what I would dub a \"Route 1 Crappy 'Mon Solo Run\". Let's face it, dear fellow gamers: none of us has any sort of respect or even consideration for Route 1 'Mons. They are used as convenient training fodder to level up our Starter before the first Gym, and we capture them solely to fill up our Pokedex. And when we keep them in our team for more than five minutes instead of sending them straight to the PC, it's usually for the sole purpose of padding said team before better and cooler 'Mons become available. In a nutshell, Route 1 'Mons are universally viewed as the very embodiment of genericness and mediocrity — in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if dictionaries featured a picture of Rattata along the definitions of these two words. And because they are so widely sniffed at, I was curious to see for myself if they could be decent solo run material.Let me tell you: the Pikipek Solo Run that ensued single-handedly changed my opinion of Route 1 'Mons forever. I now have the uttermost respect for these often overlooked creatures, and never again will I look down on them and discard them as mere training fodder and Pokedex fillers.That being said, it took some time to get there. I was none too happy with my new recrue at first: Pikipek looks like your generic Flying 'Mon, the kind you've seen a million times before in Pokemon games. His middle form left me even more unimpressed: not only is it just as generic as his initial form, but it's quite ungracious to boot. But when Pikipek's ultimate form appeared before my hopeful eyes, I had a total change of heart and fell in love with that form on the spot. Mean-looking Toucannon is just positively hilarious, with his giant colourful beak and evil eye; and I couldn't help but run to the Name Rater and change his name to \"Big B\". I had to! Toucannon is hands down one of my favourite final evolutions in Sun and Moon so far, and cruising Alola with him was an absolute delight.Looks are all well and good, but how did Pikipek & evolutions fare when it comes to fighting? Well, that was the biggest surprise there and the reason for my newfound respect for his kind: this banal, innocuous Route 1 'Mon absolutely rocks on the battlefield. He's an absolute powerhouse, with perfectly balanced overall stats and an Attack Stat as high as the Everest. Interestingly, while Pikipek and middle evolution Trumbeak also boast really high Speed, the Speed Stat takes a dive when the ultimate evolutionary threshold is crossed, leaving Toucannon with a surprisingly poor Speed Stat. (This was not a hindrance in my solo run, though; by the time Toucannon took center stage, he was so ovelevelled that he still got to act first in 95% of fights.) Unlike his avian cousin Oricorio, Toucannon boasts a really neat and varied offensive Move pool brimming with Physical Moves that take full advantage of his sky-high Attack. Normal, Fighting, Flying, Grass, Fire, Steel, Bug, Rock Moves: you name them, the big-beaked bird can learn them and unleash them on the battlefield with style. For the record, my final Move pool comprised Toucannon's signature Move Beak Blast (Flying), Bullet Seed (Grass), Thief (Dark) and Brick Break (Fighting), and that Move quartet had me covered in pretty much all battle situations. Cherry on the cake, my Toucannon had the Keen Eye Ability, which meant no Accuracy reduction on the battlefield; and gosh, did this come in handy more than once.So indeed, this was a great run that pulverized all my expectations regarding Route 1 'Mons. The next step is to tackle a Nuzlocke solo run that includes the rule \"Fainting = Death & Release\", because such a run could be wildly interesting as well: it could involve recruiting and training several 'Mons over the course of the run, which would allow me to cruise solo with unlikely solo run candidates. Now that I think of it, I don't even need to wait for my 'Mon to faint: I can decide beforehand to release my 'Mon at some point and continue my run with a freshly recuited 'Mon. Gosh, now I have even more ideas for potential Nuzlockey solo runs. A brand-new world of Pokemon goodness opened right in front of my eyes, and I'm going to enjoy it to the fullest. Not right now, though: after six Pokemon solo runs in a row, I need to take a break from the series in general and from Sun and Moon in particular. But I'll be back, and probably sooner than later: I still have to tackle a Popplio solo run, and I love Alola so much that I'll be drawn back to it eventually. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Tales of Phantasia: See you, so long, goodbye, hooray", "date": "20/03/2017", "text": "Now's the time to reveal my feelings about Tales of Phantasia, and said feelings can be summed up in one short sentence: I love that game. I love it so much that it can claim the honour of being my favourite Tales entry so far. I love everything about that debut, from its retro aesthetics to its dreamy atmosphere, without forgetting its thrilling fighting system and unobstrusive story deliciously light on cutscenes. And the cast is by far the best I've seen on a Tales game: no whiny teenager, no hysterical loli, no overbearing big brother, but rather a dignified quartet intent on fulfilling a crucial mission. Sure, said crucial mission is by no means original, since we're talking about the meat and potatoes of all J-RPGs, i.e. Saving The Bloody World; but still, things are presented in a way that's pleasantly toned-down for a J-RPG and a Tales game — especially when compared to latter Tales entries and their distinctly hysterical storytelling.So yes, I do love Tales of Phantasia. I love it so much that I would be hard-pressed to find a glaring flaw in that gem of a game; but if I had to nit-pick about something, that would probably be the fact that the random encounter rate is a trifle too high in dungeons and a trifle too low on the world map. I would have preferred to get either the opposite or a more balanced encounter rate overall — all the more so as dungeons are labyrinthine and bristling with puzzles, and it can be quite hard to keep track of what you're doing when you're interrupted every five seconds by a random battle. I could also mention the stiffness and slowness of the fighting system, which makes retaliation or escape impossible if you happen to be stuck in a bad pattern of enemies cornering and chain-hitting your team. But since it was a first try, I'll be lenient and forgive the fighting system's shortcomings, all the more so as it's quite efficient and entertaining overall.I love Tales of Phantasia, I really do; and yet, I'm now dropping it after roughly 20 delightful hours of play. And the reason for this untimely defection is quite simple: I've had enough of it, in the most positive way possible. As a matter of fact, as far as my personal RPG clock is concerned, ToP should end right now, at the 20-or-so hour mark; this just feels like the perfect length for that game. Not only that, but I've explored the whole game world and I'm currently standing at the foot of the big baddie's castle, so now would be the absolute perfect time to wrap up that game. But we're talking about a Tales game there; and if my meagre experience in the Tales department is any indication, ToP simply cannot end in such an unfussy and straightforward way. There has to be a plot twist down the line, as well as a whole lot of detours and meanderings that will obviously involve backtracking. To confirm my growing suspicions that I was in fact far from being done with ToP, I checked an online walkthrough; and sure enough, it turned out that I had actually only cleared two thirds of the game. With that, my decision to quit was cemented, and I erased my save file to make sure that I wouldn't crawl back to the game in a moment of weakness. I'd rather stop playing while the game is still pleasant and restart a brand-new run if I feel the need to play it again; since I know what to do now, the early stages will flow faster and I can hopefully come considerably further, maybe all the way to the end of the game, before I start longing for closure.Still, it amazes me to see that I always get that feeling that Tales games should wrap up and bid adieu around the 20-hour mark. In my opinion, these games seriously overstay their welcome and try to inflate their average play time by resorting to fake longevity tricks such as forced backtracking, time-sensitive side quests (which I never touch) and high random encounter rates in dungeons. The issue here is not the playing time per se — 35 hours is a perfectly reasonable playing time for an RPG, and I've been pouring many more hours than that in many RPGs — but rather the fact that Tales games don't have the necessary resources to sustain such long playthroughs. They usually feature pretty small game worlds, which makes backtracking mandatory in order to stretch playing time beyond the 20-hour mark. Likewise, dungeons are quite tiny despite being mazy, so the random encounter rate must be cranked up to eleven to ensure that these dungeons last longer than five minutes. And last but not least, the fighting system is only skin-deep despite its steep learning curve. Once you've mastered the art of positioning your characters and timing your attacks, you're pretty much set; and the only thing you'll need to learn afterwards are the resident foes' move and attack patterns and the range of your new Skills. Basically, what you do during your very first battle in the Forest of Spirits is what you'll do throughout the whole game, only with flashier and more potent Skills. I genuinely love ToP's unique brand of fighting; but for all the flashiness of its name, it's hard to deny that the \"Linear Motion Battle System\" is definitely not deep enough to provide 35 to 50 hours of continuous enjoyment. And so I'm quitting Tales of Phantasia before it becomes stale and aggravating; but I'll probably come back to it one day, if only because I enjoyed it so much. That being said, I wonder if there is a Tales entry out there that lasts less than twenty hours; if such a game indeed exists, then I would gladly get my paws on it, because a Tales entry that doesn't overstay its time and keeps things nice and short would most certainly be a blast to play as far as I'm concerned. Feel free to fill me in in you know anything about the matter, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle: A snapshot of 1990 portable gaming", "date": "16/03/2017", "text": "Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle was my second Game Boy game and saved me from a frustrating diet of Tetris and Super Mario Land, two games I only marginally enjoyed. BBCC, on the other hand, turned out to be one of my favourite Game Boy games, and I played it extensively until third game Ducktales came into the picture. It goes without saying that I purchased BBCC solely because of its ties with the Looney Tunes franchise, which was the cult classic cartoon series of my childhood; and being especially fond of ol' Bugs, any game that featured him as a hero was a must-buy. Little did I know at the time that the game had been designed with Roger Rabbit in mind and that my favourite carrot-munching rabbit was just a placeholder amongst many; but had I known it, it probably wouldn't have changed anything. Bugs Bunny as the star role or not, this game is one of my personal Game Boy cult classics; and after a whopping 25 years spent without touching it, I finally decided to play it again and see how it measured up to my pristine and perfect childhood memories.Surprisingly, BBCC stood the test of time pretty well. I only wanted to clear a couple of levels before writing down a password and picking up the game later, but I found myself playing it for two hours straight without a shred of boredom, irritation or lassitude. Not only was playing BBCC genuinely fun, but it was also quite interesting from an historical point of view. BBCC was released in 1990, and it reflects faithfully the gaming trends of that very year; and yes, I'm zeroing on a single year there, because this was the time when the gaming industry took quantum leaps every passing year. And since BBCC was one of the very first Game Boy games, it also marks the beginning of dedicated portable gaming and is thus doubly fascinating.So what does BBCC tell us about 1990 gaming in general and portable gaming in particular? Well, it first tells us that fake advertising was definitely a thing back in the days. It still is nowadays to some extent, obviously; but oh boy, is current fake advertising totally innocuous compared to its 1990 counterpart. See the cover art for that game? You have Bugs bouncing around with a milling mass of foes at his heels. That screams action, right? And the title! Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle: now that promises some insane gameplay, right? I mean, how can a game called like that, with a cover art like that and one of the looniest cast of characters ever created not be a frantic romp of epic proportions? Herm, maybe because the Game Boy wouldn't allow such a game to exist and run on its weak hardware? But nevermind that; fake advertising had to work its nasty magic on that game and make us believe we're purchasing an action-packed game when BBCC is anything but. Such underhand tricks were the meat and potatoes of gaming advertising back in the days, and that was probably a necessary evil; because let's be honest, no one would have purchased a game based on said game's real looks and performances. You really needed a whole lot of advertising polish to sell the dream and help people view games as more than just a bunch of crappy pixels.Although BBCC is definitely not the frantic, action-packed game it masqueraded to be, it's still an excellent game with a really interesting gameplay. And that leads us to another characteristic of 1990 gaming, namely the fact that gaming genres and subgenres were not so finely determined back then. Nowadays, we tend to praise games that cross over genre boundaries and borrow gameplay elements from different genres; but such a thing was routine back then. Experimentation was the key word and developers were not afraid to try all sorts of new things; and that was all the truer in the burgeoning Game Boy scene, which provided the perfect terrain to tinker with gameplay formulas at a lower cost. BBCC's gameplay is a beautiful illustration of that open and daring state of mind. The game looks like a Platformer at first glance, but there is no jumping or platforming feat of any kind. It's not a pure Puzzle game either, because the presence of foes deadly to the touch and determined to have Bugs' hide creates some tension and trepidation that are usually absent from Puzzle games. I remember vividly that back in the days, BBCC was classified as a \"Strategy\" game, and maybe that's the aptest description for what is actually happening in that game. You're presented with a series of tableaux in which you must find a viable way to pick up all the carrots lying around while avoiding deadly enemies; isn't that the perfect embodiment of what \"strategy\" is about?Then you have more random gameplay elements, such as the very pronounced Stealth flavour: more often that not, you have to avoid enemies and work your way around them rather than confront them. As a kid, I didn't perceive that Stealth dimension: I always went out of my way to eliminate as many foes as I could, making the game much harder than it needed to be in the process. I dare say that there is even a touch of Rogueliking in BBCC: the way you move Bugs around has a direct influence on the way enemy sprites move, and you can manipulate enemy movement to some extent. Starting a level by heading left can and will often have totally different consequences than starting the same level by heading right; and sometimes, heading in a certain direction at the beginning of a level is totally mandatory to clear said level, because it will set enemy movement a certain way and allow you to access areas that would be blocked by foes otherwise. Of course, like with so many games back in the days, it's hard to know if such a feature was fully intended by developers or if it was just the result of hardware limitations leading to programming oversights. That's the beauty of 1990 gaming: you could find ingenious ways to break games and relish in the thought that you were exploiting programming foibles to do things that were never planned by developers. We'll never know if Kemco actually wanted BBCC players to exploit enemy movement to their own benefit; but it works beautifully all the same.When engrish ruled in games.Last but not least comes the defining characteristic of 1990 gaming, especially in its burgeoning portable guise: while it took me several weeks to finish BBCC back in the days, the two hours I spent playing it a couple of days ago were enough to polish it off entirely. Indeed, 1990 games were short, and 1990 portable games were even shorter. While such games may have been considered poor investments, this was the norm back in the days, and everybody accepted it good-naturedly. Such paltry lengths would be unacceptable nowadays, in a gaming scene where even the meanest indie Platformer or Puzzle game packs more content than BBCC; and yet, I feel that short games are more rewarding than they may seem at first glance and should be granted a place in the current gaming landscape. Being able to polish off a game in one neat, clean go generates a feeling of completion and fulfillment that can't be emulated by longer games, no matter how tailored they are to short bursts of gameplay. I was deeply content when BBCC presented me with its final screen bristling with typos — another quirk of games of this era — and even somewhat relieved that I wouldn't have to pour more hours into the game. I'd like to get more of these gaming quickies in the current gaming scene, with the gentle price tags to match — all the more so as just like BBCC, such games tend to pack a lot of replay value.All in all, replaying BBCC 25 years after I last touched it was a great experience: it aged surprisingly well and is still very much worth playing today. The gameplay is challenging and stimulating without being unnerving, and although the game is not soul-crushingly difficult, it still provides ample opportunity for some solid brain-racking. BBCC is also weirdly relaxing, a quality I would be tempted to attribute to its barebone, nearly abstract level-design: it's like we're dealing more with a bunch of symbols than with game sprites, and I found myself unusually focused and alert as I progressed through the levels. In fact, my focus only grew as I played, as if the game was acting as some kind of meditation device; and although I died and had to restart levels more than once, I never felt a shred of irritation or lassitude. Now I remember why I loved that game so very much back in the days and why I wasn't disappointed that it didn't sport an hectic gameplay: Super Mario Land did rile me up so much and so often than getting to play a game as relaxing as BBCC was like a breath of fresh air and a soothing balm on my gaming wounds. Although I decided to snatch BBCC primarily for nostalgia's and old days' sake, I'll definitely indulge in playing it again at some point; and I certainly encourage you to do so as well if you have the opportunity, dear fellow gamers, if only for the sake of getting a taste of 1990's brand of gaming.

{"title": "Tales of Phantasia: An unlikely franchise starter ", "date": "10/03/2017", "text": "Gaming often moves in mysterious ways. Games that are critically praised sell only a handful of copies, consoles and games that are snubbed at the time of their release gather a cult following as time passes, games that no one of would have bet two cents on become massive hits; and last but not least, games that don't have a shred of originality in their code become the starting point of a thriving franchise that's still going strong twenty years later.That last sentence perfectly applies to Tales of Phantasia. First released on the SNES in 1995 and then on a slew of other systems, ToP is the prime example of a game that should have remained a one-shot yet somehow miraculously managed to give birth to a whole series. They say hindsight is 20/20; but hindsight is no help at all when trying to understand how an RPG so unremarkable and cookie-cutter could become the founding ground of what is today one of the most recognizable JRPG series. ToP is a lacklustre potpourri of all the 16-bit RPG tropes under the gaming sun and could as well have been called \"16-bit RPG 101\". It has your nondescript 16-bit-ish pixelated graphics that should elicit nostalgia yet fail partly at it because of the colours being on the dreary side of the spectrum, your mandatory Mode 7 map that stopped being impressive long ago, your strident soundtrack that tries to sound mysterious and inspired and fails utterly at it, your peaceful home village that will inevitably end up burnt to the ground and kickstart the whole adventure in the process, your cast of colourful characters that join the hero a mere five minutes after meeting him, your everything that screams 16-bit RPG. I don't think I've ever played an RPG that felt so utterly familiar and derivative and borrowed so much from its forebearers (except maybe for Tales of Hearts R; but more on that later). This shameless borrowing actually verges on plagiarism, with the story being a pared-down rip-off of Secret of Mana sprinkled with a bit of Lord of the Rings. I guess the only reason why Squaresoft didn't sue Namco into oblivion at the time was the fact that all RPG stories were pretty unimaginative back then and tended to recycle the same elements ad nauseam. Now that I think of it, they still do so nowadays — but I digress.So if ToP is that run-of-the-mill, uninventive 16-bit RPG, how could it achieve what countless other more original 16-bit RPGs, from Bahamut Lagoon to Secret of Evermore, failed to achieve? How could it warrant no only a sequel, but fifteen of them — and that's without even counting the spin-offs? Well, I have my own theory about the matter. I'd wager that the first and most minor reason ToP became the first entry in a series rather than a mere one-shot is its very title. The Tales of- structure can lend itself to all sorts of variations and potentially give birth to a infinity of games, and it carries an aura of mystery and whimsical sophistication to boot. Now that may seem like a petty and silly reason to transform an isolated game into a full-blown series; but let's be honest, stranger things have happened in the gaming industry, and we all know how important a striking title is in establishing a gaming series' brand.But not wanting to waste a perfectly good title is obviously not the only reason ToP became the founding ground of its own series; in my opinion, the second and major reason this happened is ToP's fighting system. Pompously dubbed the \"Linear Motion Battle System\" by Namco themselves, this fighting system is all at once the game's saving grace and its only genuinely original feature. It revolves entirely around position and timing, the key to fighting prowess being to move around nimbly and to trigger attacks at the right time in order to strike foes without being hit. It also has a steep learning curve and requires a lot of practise to be fully mastered, but it only gets better as the game progresses. Although it's prone to the occasionnal bout of clunkiness, with Cress being sometimes as easy to move around as a 36 ton truck, this fighting system is overall a true gem that stands halfway between the hecticness of action-based fighting systems and the deliberation of turn-based fighting systems. I'm quite convinced that this highly technical and demanding fighting system, which is still pretty unique and unrivaled to this day, is the jewel in the series' crown and its main selling point. It's not a coincidence if Namco have been refining and honing this fighting system with virtually every Tales entry; it was a huge asset in 1995 and still is nowadays, all the more as no other mainstream RPG series has dared tread on that ground.In a way, even ToP's utter genericness may actually be a strength, thanks to its all-encompassing quality. This is the kind of genericness that stems not from a lack of inspiration, but rather from a true love for its own genre and a desire to be inclusive and comprehensive. I already commented on the fact that Tales of Hearts R felt like a compendium of all modern JRPGs; and since the same holds true for ToP, I'm starting to think that this is an overall characteristic of the Tales series. That makes that series a perfect flagship for the JRPG genre; as a matter of fact, if I had to recommend a JRPG to someone who never played any, I would probably go for the Tales series. Tales games pack all the tropes and trappings of the genre while offering a compelling fighting system that should draw in players allergic to turn-based combat, they involve little to no level-grinding and last but not least, they are mercifully shorter than your average Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, clocking at roughly 35 hours on average. Heck, you could easily get your regular fix of over-the-top JRPG-ness solely by investing in the Tales series.I've poured 14 hours in the GBA version of Tales of Phantasia so far, and a future run report is obviously in the pipeline. I'll keep the suspense intact by shelving my feelings about the game until then — which basically means that this post is a wrap. See you soon for a more personal take on my ToP experience, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sun/Moon: A miscellany of good and bad points", "date": "02/03/2017", "text": "Hell is in the details, as they say; and so is heaven, as I often add. When it comes to games, my keen eye tends to linger on the most uncanny details; and my feelings for a game can often grow fonder or colder just because of a minute element that may pass the next gamer completely by. You probably know where I'm going with that, dear fellow gamers; without further ado, here's my list of all the details that charmed me and irritated me in Pokemon Sun and Moon. Enjoy!\"Lurid Ranger, go!\"The \"Gimme more\":No HM moves. This is totally the feature I've been dreaming of without even knowing it. Gosh, how heavenly it is to be at long last able to dispense with HM slaves that clutter your team and serve no purpose beyond occasionally clearing the way. I fervently hope that this change is here to stay and that HM moves are now buried in older Pokemon entries for all eternity.Being able to lie down in random people's beds, and getting informed comments about the state of said beds. Gee, how I dig up feeling like some kind of perv and sneaking into NPCs' intimacy. MCs in RPG can usually do whatever they please in NPCs' homes, but rolling around in bed sheets and burying your nose into pillows take that impunity to a whole new level. The sound effects at the Pokemon Center Cafés. Hearing these deliciously realistic pouring, slurping and gulping sounds invariably makes me want to pour myself a warm cup of tea—which I usually do. I swear that my daily tea consumption has tripled since I started playing Sun and Moon. The Team Skull encounter theme, as well as their battle theme. And the wonderfully silly way they wriggle when they talk. Oh, and their no less wonderfully silly battle pose. Heck, I love everything related to the hilarious Team Skull; they're my favourite villain team ever, period. The Z-Moves poses. They remind me of the Power Rangers TV show I used to watch when I was a kid; and watching my Trainer flail about in such a cheesy yet totally heartfelt way really puts me in an upbeat and combative mood. Had I been ten years old, I'm pretty sure I would have reproduced the moves while playing outdoors.Encountering a tanned, long-haired version of Professor Oak as I was cruising around Alola. Boy, did I have a shock when I recognize him! And yeah, I know this guy is supposed to be Oak's cousin; but I prefer to picture him as the original Professor Oak, and I'll stick to that version. The '80s-inspired colourful clothing in stores. I'm a sucker for bright colours, garish prints and '80s fashion overall, and it was pure delight to deck up my Trainer in outfits so gaudy that they could make one's eyes bleed. Oh, the joy of sneaking into strangers' beds.The \"Get outta here\":Not being able to engage in double battles without having at least two 'Mons in my team. Like, why on earth? Isn't it my right to be a daring masochist and take two 'Mons single-handedly if I feel like it? This stupid feature soiled my solo run by forcing me to recruit an extra 'Mon just to partake in these battles. Too many doors that cannot be opened. I don't remember having seen so many doors used as mere wall decorations in older Pokemon entries. What's the point of teasing me with these doors if I cannot see for myself what's behind them? This frustrates the explorer in me, it really does. Changing the battle protocol on the fly. Most of the time, you get the opportunity to save your progression before an important battle. However, the game sometimes gets a flight of fancy and throws you into battle right after an unskippable cutscene without giving you the opportunity to save. It's absolutely infuriating to get trapped in one of these vicious battles when your 'Mon's health is at its lowest; and given the game's difficulty, this can easily lead to defeat and having to redo the whole battle. The english traduction present in the European version of the game is horribly lacklustre. Very little humour and wit, no puns on 'Mons' names, no effort made to enhance character's personalities by tweaking their vocabulary. On one hand, it makes sense to make the english traduction as neutral as possible given the prevalence of the english language; but on the other hand, this is the European version and it would thus have been perfectly acceptable to pepper the english text with purely British references. The TV broadcast is utterly dull and uninteresting. The only thing you'll ever hear on Alolan TV are lame commentaries about malasadas that let you know that sweet malasadas are sweet and sour malasadas are sour. Why, thank you, Captain Obvious! After the delightful interviews in Sinnoh and the Japanese lessons and move explanations in Kalos, this lack of substance really stings. Look at me, cool as a cucumber while the world is crashing down around me.And there you have it, dear fellow gamers: the details that enthralled and enraged me in Pokemon Sun and Moon. And with that, you also have my last post dealing with overall aspects of the games—so to speak. All future posts about Sun and Moon will be solo run reports; and given how much I love these games and how many 'Mons inspire me and make me want to cruise solo with them, I'd wager that there will be a couple more posts about Sun and Moon down the line. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Nintendo: A matter of perception", "date": "24/02/2017", "text": "Internet is swarming with reactions to the Nintendo Switch these days. These reactions come in all shapes and sizes and levels of intensity, ranging from gamers screaming gloom and doom while frothing at the mouth to starry-eyed gamers finding no flaw whatsoever with the system, with the vast majority of us standing somewhere in the middle and professing our interest for the Switch while confessing our worries regarding its future performances.But no matter the intensity and nature of reactions, some gamers out there seem to have a very deep and intense love for Nintendo; a love that goes way beyond your average appreciation of your favourite console manufacturer. This is the kind of love that makes people utter sentences such as \"I really want Nintendo to succeed\" or \"We have to support Nintendo and make sure the Switch is a success by purchasing it en masse\" or even \"The gaming industry needs a thriving Nintendo\". Apart from their seemingly boundless devotion to the Big N, these vocal gamers have another thing in common: the vast majority of them hail from North-America. And while they cannot mention Nintendo's possible retirement from the console manufacturing industry without tearing up, European gamers usually just shrug at the idea and let out a wistful sigh, saying \"Sure, that's sad — but hey, c'est la vie\". These vastly different reactions confirm my long-running hunch that North-America and Europe nurture drastically different perceptions of Nintendo.In North-America, the Big N is more than a mere console manufacturer: it's a gaming institution. In fact, the very surname \"Big N\" hails straight from the USA. The story is the stuff of legend: Nintendo came up with the NES in 1986 and single-handedly revived the gaming industry, which lay in shambles after the horrendous Video Game Crash of 1983. Nintendo actually did more than just revitalize the moribund North-American gaming industry: they somehow recreated it from scratch by introducing innovations that still perdure to this day, such as the D-Pad or the idea of bundling a game with brand-new consoles. (How ironic that they giving up on these concepts with the Switch; but I digress.) They took center stage right from the NES' release and became the king of the gaming hills, basking in unparalleled domination from 1985 to 1995. Sure, Sega of 16-Bit Console Wars fame rocked their boat somehow in the early '90s; but despite their legendary boldness and aggressive marketing, Kalinske's teams only ever managed to topple Nintendo temporarily — not to mention that they were always seen as the outsider challenging the top dog rather than Nintendo's equals. Nintendo was so encompassing and ubiquitous in North-America that the brand's name basically became synonymous with gaming — with a capital G. A whole generation of gamers grew up sitting in front of a TV with an NES controller in hand and owe their childhood gaming memories to Nintendo exclusively. No wonder, then, that these gamers do not want The Big N to retire from the gaming landscape; because if Nintendo goes down the drain, so do their cherished childhood gaming memories. I can fully understand why North-American gamers who were introduced to gaming by the NES are clinging so desperately to the hope that Nintendo will endure against all odds. Because somewhere deep in their minds, Nintendo is gaming and always will be.The situation in Europe couldn't be more different, and that boils down to a single factor: there was never any gaming crash in the Old Continent. Quite the contrary; gaming was thriving in Europe in the '80s, with dozens of systems to choose from — from the ZX Spectrum to the C64, without forgetting the Amstrad GX4000 (I still remember the advertising for that machine) and virtually dozens of other pieces of kit. When Nintendo unleashed the NES upon Europe, not only were they not hailed as the saviour of gaming like in North-America, but they had to face immediate and ferocious competition from the Sega Master System, which was quite the hit in Europe. (I remember playing Alex Kidd at my cousins' house and failing to go beyond the first level because of those cursed eagles. Stupidly hard game — but I digress.) Sales figures are quite telling: the Master System had sold 6.8 millions units in Europe as of 1993, which is a far cry from the paltry 2 millions sold in North-America; the NES, on the other hand, is said to have sold a mere 3.5 millions as of 1993 — although European sales numbers are curiously hard to find, probably due to Nintendo whitewashing their poor European sales. Nintendo were never a gaming messiah in Europe, nor were they the king of the gaming hill: they were merely one of the players in the sprawling European gaming industry, and that initial perception endured ever since. Sweet nostalgia cannot even help their case, because Europeans gamers who grabbed their first D-pad in the late '80s are just as likely to owe their first gaming memories to Sega than to Nintendo — without even mentioning the plethora of other systems available at the time. As a matter of fact, when it comes to pure probabilities backed by sales figures, these European gamers are more likely to owe their first gaming memories to another system than the NES. And this is why European gamers can mention Nintendo bailing out of the console manufacturing industry without batting an eyelid: for us, Nintendo was always just one console manufacturer amongst many others. We were able to bid Sega consoles farewell without too much drama back in the days, and so would we be able to bid Nintendo consoles farewell in the same quiet way. We're used to it, after all: we've seen countless console manufacturers exit the gaming scene over the years, and we came to develop a nearly fatalistic attitude towards the console manufacturing industry. Systems come and systems go, but gaming always endure — that's our stance.So there you have the full picture as far as perception of Nintendo goes on Western shores. North-American gamers cling to Nintendo as the symbol of their happy gaming childhood and the very reason why they are able to play games today, while European gamers go with the flow and lose little time musing over the many console manufacturers that graced Europe with their offerings since the dawn of gaming. It's no coincidence that Nintendo never released the Power Glove and the Virtual Boy in Europe: European gamers were never as devoted to the Nintendo brand as their North-American counterparts, even after the number of gaming systems available in the Old Continent shrunk dramatically in the early '90s. Would we be sad if Nintendo went third-party in the years to come? Sure. Would it be a blow to our gaming morale? Certainly not. There are other console manufacturers out there, and someone could certainly fill the void left by Nintendo if they bailed out. As long as there will be a dedicated console market, there will be companies to occupy it. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Moon: The Oricorio solo run", "date": "20/02/2017", "text": "A.k.a. The Run That Shouldn't Have Been. See, I initially wanted my first Moon solo run to be a Popplio one, and that's actually what it was at first. Unfortunately, I was unlucky enough to be given a Popplio with a Sassy Nature. A bloody Sassy Nature, on a 'Mon that already has a pitifully low base Speed by default. What do you think happened? Heck, you guessed it: despite being overlevelled, my Popplio always acted second in battle. This quickly got on my nerves, to the point where I seriously considered erasing my save file and restarting my playthrough with a Popplio more fitted to solo run endeavours. But as I was pondering that possibility, I happened to encounter a wild Oricorio in Melemele Meadow; and hot on the heels of that fateful encounter came the idea of recycling my Popplio solo run into an Oricorio solo run. I had already come that far and Oricorio was one of my potential candidates for future solo runs anyway; so why not use the opportunity and spare myself the waste of a couple of hours of play? And that's how I found myself running solo with the dancing bird while I put my Popplio into early retirement on Poke Pelago. Sheesh, guess Lusamine was totally right about Trainers being cold-hearted pricks that get rid of their 'Mons when said 'Mons don't perform well enough in battle.\"Don't perform well enough in battle\" is definitely not a sentence that applies to Oricorio in any of her forms. Gosh, that bird packs some serious punch and is just a perfect 'Mon to tackle a solo run. She levels up fast and boasts perfectly balanced stats, with no crippling weakness and two major strengths, i.e. Speed and Special Attack stats that go through the roof. The form change feature is just the perfect tool to tackle Trials without having to resort to a massive amount of battle items, and it's quite a nice diversion to boot: staring at the same 'Mon for hours in a solo run can be a a trifle monotonous, but Oricorio's four forms bring in a nice bit of visual variety. I switched at will between the three forms that were available during the main game (shame on you, Game Freak, for stingily sticking the most awesome form of the bunch behind the postgame wall), finally settling on the Baile style for most on my run. And boy, was it a blast to cruise Alola with such a powerful and stylish 'Mon.That being said, I wouldn't deem Oricorio a perfect 'Mon by any means. In fact, Oricorio is pretty much a missed opportunity: she is quite a fine 'Mon as she is, but she could have been an outstanding 'Mon with a bit more effort on Game Freak's part. What drags the dancing bird down and prevents her from reaching the pinnacle of Pokemon greatness is her crippingly, ridiculously, infuriatingly limited Move pool. I though Rowlet was bad in that department; but oh boy, had I seen nothing yet. I had yet to meet Oricorio, i.e. The 'Mon That Can Solely Learn Two Move Types by Levelling Up. Yup, you've read that right: apart from Agility, which is a Psychic Status Move, Oricorio can solely learn Normal and Flying Moves by levelling up. Could it get any worse than that? Is there actually a 'Mon out there that has a worse move pool when it comes to Move Types — apart from your usual Magikarp or Cosmog, which are bound to evolve into kick-ass forms? Oricorio does not evolve and must endure being on a virtual Move Type diet for all eternity. And don't think that the colourful bird has it better on the TM front: she has to endure serious restriction there as well, with only a couple of Status Moves and a paltry two offensive Moves not belonging to Normal and Flying Type at her disposal. This is pure Move Type starvation, that's what it is.It may seem like I'm nitpicking there, especially given that Oricorio's severe Move Type limitations didn't hinder my progression in the slightest. But mind you, there is more at stake here than a mere cosmetic issue (i.e. me growing blasé after 17 hours on a Normal and Flying Move diet): this Move Type restriction makes Oricorio's Double Type Variation gimmick virtually pointless. Like probably every Sun and Moon player, I assumed at first glance that Oricorio would be able to learn Moves belonging to her secondary Typing, and was seriously disappointed when I realized this was not the case; but it turns out that as a solo runner, I actually had more use for Oricorio's Double Typing than my fellow party runners. Although the dancing bird has obviously been designed to assume the role of the resident powerful Flying 'Mon in a party setting, her inability to learn Moves that tap into her secondary Types means that the sole advantage of said secondary Types is the array of Resistances tied to them. That leads us to a situation where in a classic party setting, Oricorio will be the best choice only when facing an opponent that is weak against Flying and belongs to one of the Types she's resistant to in any of her forms. How often is that likely to happen? Clearly not enough to justify the existence of the Double Type Variation gimmick as it is. Like I said above, this gimmick can only be of any use in a solo run, where all Trials have to be tackled with Oricorio alone; and even in such a case, it's far from being a game-changer. I switched my Oricorio's Type two or three times over the course of my run to make Trials easier; but knowing that I could have obtained the same results with a couple of Battle Items, being restricted to two Move Types during my whole run was too steep a price to pay for a couple of Resistances. In the end, Oricorio's form change gimmick is just that: a form change gimmick, bound to please the eye but with no real use in battle whatsoever.I cannot fathom why Game Freak decided not to implement Moves belonging to Oricorio's secondary Typings, and I see only two possible reasons for that glaring omission. The first is that it may have proved too hard or even impossible to program; but in that case, Game Freak should have created four separate versions of Oricorio, each with its own Pokedex entry, and ditched the Nectar trigger altogether. The second is that it would have made Oricorio completely overpowered; but in that case, Game Freak should have given the bird access to more Move Types in order to make her more versatile and useful on the battlefield. In the end, nothing justifies the chosen implementation of Oricorio's Double Type variation; this is just bad Pokemon design and a massive missed opportunity.That being said, I still enjoyed my Oricorio solo run and definitely recommend that 'Mon for a solo run, providing that you can stomach the lack of Move Type variety. Before I wrap up this post, here's one last anecdote for the road. When I play pairs of Pokemon games, I usually play as both the resident male and female Trainer, one for each version; and the choice of which Trainer to play in which version usually boils down to chance or to my mood of the moment. But in the case of Sun and Moon, I was intent on playing as the male Trainer in Moon. Why, you may ask? Well, because of Evangelion. More precisely because of the famous Evangelion art book called Der Mond, which I never owned but heard off, like basically anybody who was an anime fan around 2000. I remember thinking that it was just so damn cool that the word \"moon\" was a masculine word in German, while being a feminine word in most latin-derived languages; this detail kickstarted my interest in linguistics and has been stuck in my memory ever since, prompting me to pick a male Trainer for my playthrough of Moon nearly twenty years later. And on that colourful note, I'm wrapping up that post, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Sonic Boom - Fire and Ice: Nothing new under the sun", "date": "16/02/2017", "text": "Let's get straight to the point for once: this game could as well have been subtitled \"Shattered Crystal 2\". It's a virtual copy-paste of the first Sonic Boom entry on the 3DS: it sports the same aesthetics, the same cast of characters,  the same physics, the same gameplay, the same weirdly vague zone themes, the same lacklustre soundtrack and the same overall atmosphere. Everything I said about Shattered Crystal applies to that game to a T, and that's why I'm going to focus on the — very few — new features that Fire and Ice brings to the table.Let's start with the game's main selling point, i.e. the fire and ice gimmick. It's actually quite good for what it's worth, and it completes nicely the already existing Sonic Boom mechanics; but unfortunately, it's also completely underexploited. I fully expected the world of Fire and Ice to be solely composed of fiery and wintery zones that would have pushed that new gameplay feature to its limits; but instead, we have a potpourri of very classic and cookie-cutter zones in which the fire and ice gimmick is used only sporadically. Not only is that poor use a missed opportunity, but it also dilutes the impact of the character-specific gameplay mechanics introduced in Shattered Crystal. Fire and Ice could as well have featured Sonic alone for all the use it makes of the rest of the crew's abilities — and in my opinion, it definitely should have featured the Blue Blur alone in a land of fire and ice so gorgeous it would have made Georges R. R. Martin green with envy.Mind you, the fact that character-specific abilities take a backseat in F&I is not entirely negative. It does away with one of SC's most annoying elements, namely the obligation to clear levels over and over again with different characters in order to be able to progress at all. This infuriating display of fake longevity is absent from F&I, replaced by a fluid progression that lets you rush forward to your heart's content. That makes F&I more akin to a genuine Platformer, while SC felt and played more like some sort of weird mix of Platformer and Action-Adventure game.F&I is also noticeably harder than SC, which really took me by surprise — before I started huffing and puffing about it, that is. This added difficulty doesn't please me in the slightest, all the more so as it destroys what was in my opinion the strongest point of the Boom series' gameplay: its very un-Sonic relaxing quality. SC's gameplay was casual and thus pleasantly soothing, in an oddly unexpected way; F&I's gameplay, on the other hand, is more demanding and ends up being quite irritating. I am not ashamed to admit that I ragequit a couple of times and that playing that game felt more often like a exercise in frustration than like a relaxing outlet. And mind you, the level of difficulty involved is as bad as it can be: it's high enough to get on one's nerves, yet not high enough to be challenging and thus genuinely thrilling. This becomes painfully obvious when considering the Challenge Rooms, which are small bonus stages featuring some really tricky platforming; said platforming is so well-crafted and demanding that clearing these stages is truly exhilarating, and that's all the difficulty that game needed in my opinion. Just give us those nerve-racking challenges in small doses and let us luxuriate in that mellow trademark Boom gameplay.All in all, I really can't fathom why this sequel was released at all. It was delayed by a whole year, and one could have thought that Sanzaru Games put some major work into the project; instead, what we got is a copy-paste of the first game with an underused gimmick added. What's the point of even developing such a game? Mind you, I know what the point is: the target audience for the Boom subseries are kids, and kids have long forgotten everything about the first entry and are no doubt treating F&I as a totally new and fresh game. For those of us who have longer memory spans and still own Shattered Crystal, Fire and Ice is an entirely dispensable purchase. It brings too little to the Boom formula and takes away too much from it to be worth playing, and that's coming from someone who genuinely enjoyed Shattered Crystal. I'll probably sell my copy of F&I at some point and hold onto SC for future replays; because SC is really all I need if I want to get a fix of that soothing Boom signature gameplay. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Nintendo Switch: The Great Game Drought", "date": "11/02/2017", "text": "The damage control around the Switch is still going on full force, with Nintendo die-hard fans, optimistic gamers and gaming journalists trying to whitewash and gloss over the console's flaws. And granted, maybe we're all being overly dramatic about the Switch; after all, many of the system's initial flaws can be managed and even entirely erased. Sure, the battery life is pitiful; but trust Nintendo to produce another more endurant model down the line. Sure, the idea of a paying an app for voice chat is ludicrous; but trust Nintendo to backpedal and make the thing entirely free if gamers are becoming too angry and vocal. Sure, the console, games and accessories are ridiculously overpriced; but trust Nintendo to lower prices massively if their stuff doesn't sell, just like they did with the 3DS. There is, however, one glaring flaw that cannot be mitigated or sugar-coated, and that flaw is the shocking lack of games. And this time, you cannot trust Nintendo to come up with a magic fix, because they've proven with the WiiU that they were unable to produce more games or to bring in third-party developers even if their life depended on it — and in a way, it did. But that doesn't prevent the damage control brigade from bandying all sorts of disingenuous justifications and excuses for the Switch anaemic's launch line-up, such as:\"But we already have a meaty AAA game at launch, and that's Breath of the Wild! A game that huge and amazing should surely occupy you for many months, right?\" Well, I hate to point out the obvious and piss on your bonfire, but we don't know yet if BOTW is going to be a game meaty enough to occupy us for several months. For all we know, it could have a 5-hour-long main quest with tons of fluff and filler on the side. But there is more: we don't even know yet if that game is going to be good at all. Nintendo have built up the hype around BOTW so skillfully that we all assume that this game is going to be a masterpiece; but for all we actually do know at that point, it could be just a mediocre or barely satisfactory game. To bet so much on a game that we still know so little about and that has yet to be reviewed is just unreasonable, especially considering Nintendo's recent track record when it comes to their own IPs. The latest entries of Animal Crossing, Star Fox and Paper Mario were deemed quite mediocre; and Ninty has not exactly been delivering on the Zelda front either, with only four HD remakes, a derivative follow-up to a 1991 entry and a clunky multiplayer spin-off released in the last console generation. And even if BOTW turns out to be the best Zelda entry ever released, there are gamers out there that don't fancy the Zelda series and/or open-word games with tons of crafting and running around, and BOTW won't make these gamers warm up to the idea of purchasing a Switch day one.\"There are enough great games slated for release as it is! How many games do you need exactly? Just stop piling up stuff and focus on one game at once!\" While it's true that my backlog could use a bit of shearing, this argument doesn't hold water in the current gaming landscape. In the early '90s, a single high-profile game could easily unify all gamers under its overbearing and encompassing greatness. Things were simpler back then: the overwhelming majority of gamers followed the dominant gaming trends with a enthusiam only matched by their zeal to get rid of games that were not trendy anymore, and it was easy to feed them any killer app. Nintendo themselves gave birth to some of these massively successful and highly revered crowd-pleasers: Super Mario 64, Super Mario World, Ocarina of Time, you name them. However, the gaming industry has changed since the '90s, and so have gamers' expectations. The meteoric rise of indie, retro and portable gaming has created a gaming landscape in which every gamer can find games tailored to their tastes, no matter how niche or quirky these tastes happen to be. We gamers have grown used to being pampered and treated to the exact games we want, and we're not going to renounce cherry-picking our games just because Nintendo cannot be bothered to release games catering to all gaming tastes — not when there are others console manufacturers around. My point is: in today's gaming scene, you need a wide array of games covering many gaming genres to bring a large audience to your console. You can't simply release one high-profile game every three month and call it a day. Heck, you can't even get away with releasing one high-profile game and five digital indies every three months like Nintendo is about to do until the end of the year. This kind of publishing policy simply doesn't cut it in 2017, and no gamer beyond hardcore Nintendo fans are going to be content with that.\"A huge launch line-up doesn't automatically imply success! The Vita failed with 25 launch games, and the Game Boy soared with only 5!\" Sure, numbers don't lie, and those facts are pretty much undeniable. But someone coming up with this argument has to be either extremely disingenuous or naive beyond belief; because once again, these wild variations boil down to gaming eras and concurrent expectations. While Nintendo could still afford to release the N64 with only two launch games in North-America in 1996, such a behaviour would be nothing short of suicidal nowadays. The PS4 struggled to gain traction despite its 25 launch games, and the 3DS' 15-or-so games left gamers so unimpressed that the system very nearly died in its first months of existence. What was still perfectly acceptable two console generations ago — the PS3 launched with 14 games and the DS with just 7 in North-America — is totally unthinkable nowadays. As I mentioned above, most of us gamers want many games to choose from; and if a game manufacturer don't provide enough games for our tastes, we will simply jump ship and take our business to the next console manufacturer or to PC. We're not willing anymore to purchase a console bereft of games and grind and bear it until games start arriving, especially not when other consoles with bulging game libraries are courting us.\"Third-party devs and Nintendo themselves are cooking up some games as we're speaking! Just you wait until E3! There will be tons of games released before the end of 2017!\" No, there won't. If tons of games had indeed been in the pipeline, they would have been shown at the Switch presentation. Why on earth would Nintendo present us with mere concept art, declarations of goodwill and trailers totally devoid of any gameplay if they had games slated for release in 2017? It's not like they wouldn't know about these games at that point, now would they? And why would third-party developers themselves be so hush-hush about their upcoming releases for the Switch, in a gaming era where games are teased years before their actual release? (Kingdom Hearts III, anyone?) And why would Nintendo themselves feed us so many ports of already released games if they had some new material nearly ready for launch? Sure, Nintendo and third-party devs are indeed cooking up some games right now; but these games won't be released before 2018, maybe even 2019 for the slowest developers. (If we see Octopath Traveller before the end of next year, I'm ready to eat my special edition of Bravely Second.) The only developers that could pull off 2017 surprise releases while having no material ready at the time of the Switch presentation are super-niche developers à la Experience Inc. and indie devs, and there's nothing to expect from them; the former are too busy crafting games for the Vita and the latter usually need months of Kickstarting before they can even write a line of code. Let's face it, people: what we've seen at the Switch presentation is what we'll get in 2017. There will be no releases coming like a bolt out of the blue, and the whole Nintendo E3 conference will be devoted to showcasing footage from Super Mario Odyssey. And that Pokemon Stars game we were all waiting for? I'm pretty sure it's not coming before 2018. If it's coming at all.\"Nintendo just published a list of all the upcoming Switch games, and now we have 106 games to look forward to in the next years! There's nothing to worry about!\" Fair enough; but unfortunately, a good two thirds — if not three quarters — of these games still don't have a release date. Heck, I'm sure that the development process for those games hasn't even started yet, which means that we won't see them before 2018 or even 2019. And mind you, just because third-party developers are announcing their intention to release games on the Switch doesn't mean that these games will actually see the light of day: those developers are simply keeping their options open, and they will be quick to pull out the plug and cancel these games whose development has probably yet to start if the Switch doesn't sell well enough. The exact same thing happened with the WiiU and is even more likely to happen nowadays: no game is safe anymore and any game can be cancelled without mercy, as the Scalebound fiasco abundantly proves. So until these games have release dates set in stone, we can as well consider them as gaming potentialities rather than actual games.Mark my words: the Switch is a console starved of games and will remain that way for a very long time. Heck, it could even remain that way forever. If the WiiU debacle has taught us something, it's definitely that no console can thrive without a solid library of games and that not having enough games available in the early stages of a console's lifetime can scare away third-party developers and create a vicious circle in which the number of games developed for the console steadily decreases over time. Too bad Nintendo didn't learn that lesson as acutely as we did and didn't bother securing third-party support and developing a slew of first-party high-profile titles long before the Switch's release. They're obviously being stingy, lazy and complacent when it comes to the Switch; and that stinginess, laziness and complacency may be their downfall. The Switch launch could have been the most epic, glorious and flamboyant console launch of them all, with games up the wazoo and Nintendo making their second coming; instead, it's a dud of massive proportions that has the audacity to line up even less games than the WiiU did. Damage-control all you want, but there's no escaping that dire reality. And let's remember, people, that the WiiU actually had a rather good launch before third-party devs deserted it and made it the failure it is today. If the WiiU failed despite its more consequent launch line-up and stronger initial third-party support, what hope is there for the Switch to soar and be Nintendo's saving grace? Only time will tell. I'll be waiting for the games to appear; and if they don't, I'll pass on the Switch with no regrets. With that, I rest my case. Thanks for reading, dear fellow gamers, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Nintendo Switch: The state of the hype", "date": "08/02/2017", "text": "I can't open Youtube these days without being greeted by a Recommended tab swarming with Nintendo Switch-related videos. Negative Nintendo Switch-related videos, should I say, because the overall tone of this abundant material is not exactly positive: rant videos make the bulk of the Switch-related content, with beaming and optimistic videos being few and far between. As videos and articles about the Switch keep piling up on the internet, it's now time to examine the state of the hype surrounding the upcoming Nintendo Switch—and Nintendo's prospects in general.Let's face it, the situation is quite dire. The Switch hype has pretty much deflated like an overcooked soufflé since the now infamously lousy Switch presentation, with all the excitement generated by the system since the october trailer virtually evaporating in a matter of days—if not hours. I don't think I've ever seem the hype surrounding a gaming system collapse so quickly; and yet, as Youtube is flooded with \"Switch will fail\" and \"WTF is Nintendo doing\" videos, a lot of damage control is simultaneously going on.I should rather say sheer denial, actually. Defending Nintendo's atrocious approach to the Switch and giving it a positive spin does require metric tons of denial and wishful thinking, but some gamers seem to have no shortage of these things. I've watched videos of starry-eyed gamers postulating that the reason Nintendo revelead so few games in the Switch presentation is because they are keeping some high-profile projects under wraps for E3 2017. That's a lovely theory, but there are virtually no chances that this is indeed the case. Nintendo have not performed game reveals on a massive scale at E3 for years, and I seriously doubt they will do so in 2017. Let's face it, folks: the most likely reason Nintendo revealed so few games during the Switch presentation is because there are no games to reveal. They had no qualms about announcing that Super Mario Odyssey would be released at the end of 2017, so why would they be coy about other games? That \"Shelving Games for E3\" theory doesn't hold water, especially when considering Nintendo's E3 track record these last years.This game issue leads us to another newly sprouted topic regarding the Switch and Nintendo in general. Some gamers are starting to speculate about the Switch's possible failure and its most likely consequence, which is none other than Nintendo retiring from the hardware business and going third-party full force. Such conjectures were unthinkable two console generations ago when the Big N was soaring along the Wii and DS, and they were pretty much taboo while the Wii U and 3DS were struggling to gain traction; but now that Nintendo seems to be failing to read and ride the gaming zeitgeist once again, gamers are no longer shy to discuss Nintendo going the Sega way. Some are even bolder and assert that this would be the best option for everyone, including Nintendo themselves: they could stop wasting resources on woefully underpowered consoles and pour all their energy into the development of mind-blowing games, milking their popular IPs for generations of consoles to come. How awesome would it be to play an HD Mario game on the PS5 or the XBox Whatever-enigmatic-name-Microsoft-come-up-with? How wonderful would it be to get all Nintendo IPs on one's console of choice without having to worry about the lack of third-party support? That sounds stellar indeed, and I can understand why so many gamers are slowly but surely warming up to the idea of Ninty going third-party.There's only one teeny-tiny problem with this dream scenario: Nintendo doesn't seem to be able to produce games properly anymore. They were not even able to get a new Mario out the door for the Switch release, and Zelda \"forever\" Breath of the Wild has been in development for so long that it was initially supposed to be the resident WiiU entry of the series. Most of the time, Nintendo doesn't even bother doing the bare minimum when it comes to long-running games series, i.e. releasing at least one new instalment on every new console they produce. And the stuff they do manage to get out the door is becoming increasingly derivative and superficial. Titles like Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival and AC: Happy Home Designer are barely games at all, Paper Mario: Color Splash is widely said to be the most casual entry in the series and all the recent canon Mario games revolve more around collecting Stars than around clearing increasingly complicated levels like back in the days. And that's without even talking about Nintendo's readiness to recycle their own winning gaming formulas: Star Fox Zero is basically a reboot of the original Star Fox with a cumbersome control gimmick added and every Mario entry released on the WiiU and 3DS is a rehash of old Mario games. Will they be able to dazzle and make big bucks as a third-party developer with such an anaemic game production? Heck, I don't think so.Moving on to the Switch's marketing pitch, one sentence that's being bandied around more and more often since the presentation is the \"Play AAA games on the go\" motto. Some gamers utter this like it's the market positioning to rule them all, the magic formula that will guarantee the Switch's success. But wait, doesn't this sound eerily familiar? Didn't somebody try this marketing ploy before, assuming that all gamers wanted to play AAA games on a handheld? Why, obviously: this used to be the main selling point of the Playstation Vita back in 2012. Did it work on the long run? Nope. And mind you, the Vita actually had a very good lauch, with no less than 25 launch titles including big-profile games. What's more, the Vita didn't underperform because Sony stopped supporting it; instead, they stopped supporting it because it didn't perform well. And why didn't it perform well? Could it be because gamers don't care about playing AAA games on the go after all? Could it be because portable gamers are purchasing handhelds first and foremost for the exclusive and highly specific brand of gaming offered by such systems? Heck, I'd wager that 95% of the current Vita install base is made of niche games aficionados—and that obviously includes yours truly. Sony failed to understand that handhelds are not mere hardware options but rather self-sufficient gaming ecosystems that appeal to a certain audience, and it seems that Nintendo is failing to understand this as well. Will the 3DS install base move over to the Switch? If the franchises they used to play and love on Ninty's handhelds do not move over to the Switch themselves, I seriously doubt it. Heck, I know I wouldn't do it.So, that's where we are today. The hype has deflated, and most gamers have adopted a cautious \"Let's wait and see\" stance that more often than not involves not purchasing the console at launch and waiting for more games to be released. No matter how you look at it and no matter how much of a Nintendo fan you are, it's hard to deny that the Big N is in a precarious position right now. We'll see how things evolve in the months to come, and I'll probably write more posts about the Nintendo Switch—because let's face it, I'm kinda hooked on all that Nintendo drama now.

{"title": "Pokemon Y: The male Meowstic solo run", "date": "05/02/2017", "text": "My Rowlet solo run showed me that defensive 'Mons with a reduced offensive move pool can nonetheless be decent solo run material; and in the wake of that discovery, I suddenly needed to tackle a male Meowstic solo run. The deed didn't seem so impossible after all, especially considering how shamelessly easy X and Y are.No sooner said that done; I stuck my still unplayed Y cartridge into my 3DS and before I knew it, I was roaming Route 6 and hunting for Espurrs. I must confess that I actually had this wild fantasy of attempting to cruise Kalos with a shiny male Espurr—nevermind the fact that I never ever encountered a shiny 'Mon in any of my Pokemon playthroughs. However, after it took me roughly two hours to capture a dozen male Espurrs, I realized how futile this hope was and moved on with my run. Now, why capture so many Espurrs, you may ask? Well, because I wanted to take advantage of another feature I had failed to take into account until then; and that feature is none other than Pokemons' Natures. See, I wanted to give myself as good an edge as possible and to compensate for my future Meowstic's unavoidable weaknesses by choosing the most fitting Nature. I didn't go as far as to hunt for a specific Nature, mind you; I recruited a bunch of Espurrs and chose the one with the Nature that best fitted my purposes. The lucky winner turned out to be an Espurr with a Quiet Nature, which was quite a good bargain considering that Meowstic's Speed is fairly high and could thus tolerate a bit of lowering; and since Meowstic's most powerful offensive moves are Special moves, an increase in Sp. Attack was definitely most welcome.The ensuing run went incredibly smoothly and was pure delight from beginning to end. Despite the fact that male Meowstic does indeed has a ridiculously tiny offensive move pool, I managed to end up with a quartet of offensive moves belonging to four different Types by the end of my run, which was more than I had dared hope for and allowed me to handle pretty much all battle situations. Since this is Pokemon Y we're talking about, my Meowstic obviously reached the big 100 level-wise before the credits rolled and could take care of the Elite Four without breaking a sweat. Now that's a job well done, especially for a defensive 'Mon.Cruising Kalos again right after Alola was a bit of a trudge, I must admit. The fact that you simply cannot get rid of those cursed roller blades is infuriating, and the sheer abundance of towns in Kalos still doesn't sit well with me. And gosh, Serena is the less stimulating rival ever. Not only did she seem less than enthusiastic to spar with me, but her incredibly sorrowful expression at the end of battles made me feel horrible for repeatedly beating her. I want my Pokemon rivals to rile me up, damnit, not to make me want to hug them and rub their back after every fight! Good thing Game Freak ditched the rival pattern entirely for Sun and Moon instead of offering yet another half-hearted rival.On the other hand, playing Y right after Sun made me realize how painfully slow the latter is. I knew that already, but being thrown on Kalos' roads literally two minutes after starting the game really drove the point home. And we're not talking solely about the general pacing: battles in Y are also ten times snappier and brisker than their Sun and Moon counterparts, with their endless intros and slow-emptying life bars. On the other hand, Y sports considerably more of these annoying caves full of Zubats, and I was none too happy to be reunited with them. The swift and flowing pacing also deteriorates in the second half of the game, which is way too drawn-out for my taste. So if I had to pick up my favourite pair of games between X/Y and Sun/Moon , I'd still choose the latter over the former despite their diluted pacing and combat that feels likes you're battling through molasses.I actually wonder if Game Freak may have been somehow testing the waters with X and Y before rehauling the Gym system in Sun and Moon. The Gym distribution in Kalos is quite unusual when compared to former entries, with Gyms seemingly popping up randomly in towns—so randomly, in fact, that I always lose track of the number of Gyms I've cleared at some point and invariably end up surprised when I'm told that I can now challenge the Elite Four. Gone is the rock-solid and long-enduring \"One Town, One Gym\" pattern, and in its place comes a much less linear repartition of the game's famous eight milestones. Could this more haphazard Gym distribution have been envisioned as a way to break the traditional Gym mould and subtly introduce players to a different structure while gauging their reactions, or is it just me reading too deep into matters? We can't know for sure, but I really fancy thinking that Game Freak had things mapped out long before the first line of code for Sun and Moon was even written.With that, I'm done with my male Meowstic solo run. It was an incredibly pleasant run that made me want to attempt even more solo runs with 'Mons that may be considered poor solo run material at first glance. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Nintendo Switch: Random technical enquiries", "date": "31/01/2017", "text": "As the Switch release date is getting closer and Nintendo is as tongue-tied as ever about specs and technical aspects of the system, unanswered questions are bound to pile up. I've been pondering a couple of points myself since the Switch presentation, and I sure hope to get conclusive answers as soon as possible. Without further ado, here are my burning technical enquiries about the Nintendo Switch:Can the system be used exclusively on portable mode from the get-go, or is a TV required at least for the initial configuration? The answer is not as crystal-clear as it may seem, and it's not guaranteed at all that the Switch can be booted up right away and played solely on tablet mode. Let's take the example of the PS4 remote play on the Vita: while it's perfectly possible to stream PS4 games on a Vita without any TV at all, a TV monitor is still necessary to install the PS4 at first. Granted, we're talking about a single occurrence, but it's a serious hurdle nonetheless for a gamer like me who doesn't own a TV. If the Switch works in a similar way, that would be a major deterrent to a purchase as far as I'm concerned. It's now established that the resolution and frame rate will vary between tablet play and TV play. Now, doesn't that mean that developers will have to come up with two different versions of the same game if they want to exploit these specs to the fullest? Like, one version that can be accommodated by the tablet and another for dock-powered TV play? I'm not a tech wizard and I have very scant notions regarding such matters, but my meagre understanding is that squeezing a game with high specs into a console that cannot accommodate such specs will not result in an smooth automatic downgrading, so to speak; the console will either have major difficulties running the game (case in point: Pokemon Sun and Moon on the original 3DS model) or be purely and simply unable to run it. This means that either developers will indeed have to develop two versions of every single game, which I seriously doubt anybody but Nintendo will do, or they will have to downgrade their games right away to the level of the tablet's specs, which I'd wager every developer but Nintendo will do. Or will some developers choose to limit their efforts solely to one of the two display modes, ignoring the other entirely? Like, could we have games that will run solely in docked mode or tablet mode? Is that even technically possible? And if it is, will Nintendo allow it?Because Nintendo decided to go all Wii on us again, these stupid little Joy-Cons contain batteries. Now let's imagine an hypothetical situation in which you play some motion game or some Mario Kart 8 on the TV with the Joy-Cons for some time, then decide to play something on the tablet. Since you've been using the Joy-Cons separately from the tablet screen, doesn't that imply that there will be a discrepancy in the battery levels of the Joy-Cons and the tablet screen? Could this lead to a situation where the Joy-Cons will die on you before the tablet screen, de facto preventing you from using the screen's full battery? Or will the Joy-Cons suck power away from the tablet screen, which could then lead to faster battery depletion? And if the Joy-Cons don't feed from the screen battery, does that mean that they must always be recharged in their dedicated dock? Because then again, such a configuration would be a major deterrent as far as I'm concerned. Charging one system on a regular basis is enough work as it is, and there's no way I'm going to double that workload. One's home contains only so many AC sockets, after all. Those are my enquiries of the moment, and more will undoubtedly pop up as time goes on. The Switch is shaping up to be a very fussy and complicated console indeed, and I cannot say that my desire to get one is increasing. Hopefully things will clarify in due time and possible technical issues will be solved in an efficient way. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sun: The Midday Lycanroc solo run", "date": "27/01/2017", "text": "A.k.a. the run that blew me out of the water and proved further that good candidates for Pokemon solo runs come in all shapes and sizes—and types. My expectations regarding a Rockruff solo run were the lowest of the low: my sole reason to attempt such a solo run were the rocky canine's looks, which I deemed irresistible despite not exactly digging dogs. So far, this is the first time ever I love all of a 'Mon's forms equally. There is usually always a crappy form nested somewhere in the evolution process, but not so with Rockruff: his pup form is too adorable to handle and his vulpine form oozes haughtiness and poise. On top of that, his overall design is a perfect mix of animal shape and natural elements tapping into his typing, which should be the blueprint for all Pokemon designs. But when it comes to the gorgeous canine's fighting performances, I expected to have a pretty hard ride and to be forced to keep my Rockruff permanently high on Battle Items in order to progress. After all, we're talking about a 'Mon with five weaknesses, no immunities whatsoever and only four resistances, which is probably as lousy as it gets when it comes to Type effectiveness. The reality couldn't have been more removed from that vision of doom. Not only was my Rockruff solo run considerably more pleasant than I had expected, but it was also much smoother and easier than my Litten and Rowlet solo runs. I got a really sleek ride this time around, and this can be attributed to three factors:Rockruff naturally levels up much faster than his fellow starters and can thus tower over opponents much more effortlessly. Rockruff and his evolution Lycanroc (midday form) have stellar Attack and Speed stats, which is a blessing in a solo run. Rockruff learns powerful moves much earlier than his fellow starters. Let's take the example of a move of any Type with power ranging between 55 and 65: Litten and Dartrix learn such a move at lv. 15 (respectively Fire Fang and Razor leaf), but Rockruff learns such a move at lv. 7 (Bite). And believe me when I say that this makes all the difference in the world. When I recruited my Rockruff at Ten Carat Hill, he was already wielding Bite and could wreak serious havoc on Alola's fauna. That being said, Rockruff still has some massive deficiencies that needed to be handled properly. The most blatant one is obviously his wide array of Type weaknesses, which didn't bode well for upcoming Trials. I was especially fidgety and anxious about the Water Trial, for very obvious reasons: we're talking about the game's second Trial only, which means that I couldn't rely on overlevelling to punch my way through. Fortunately for me, the Totem Pokemon was dumb enough to use a move that transformed my Rockruff into a Water-type 'Mon right on the very first turn—needless to say, this took care of matters. I powered through the Grass and Ground Trials with a couple of Battle Items; and by the time I reached the Elite Four and got to face Hala, my Rockruff was ovelevelled enough to take down his Fighting 'Mons without breaking a sweat. And while I'm mentioning the Elite Four, my Rockruff was around lv. 75 when we finally reached Mount Lanakila's summit, i.e. a good twenty levels above his opponents. Easy-peasy! Now this is the kind of edge I want for my Elite Four showdowns, not this paltry ten level-lead I had to endure with Incineroar and Decidueye.Rockruff's other main shortcoming is his abysmal Special Attack stat, which could have put me in a bind; fortunately, the game took care of that issue itself. All the offensive moves Rockruff and Lycanroc learn by leveling-up are Physical moves, as well as most of their TM/HM moves. Out of a total of 13 offensive moves, only four are Special moves, which gives more than enough leeway to operate without ever worrying about Rockruff and Lycanroc's crappy Sp. Attack stat. I mentioned in my Rowlet run report that I was not sure I would ever need to take Move Categories into account again, and I'm quite glad my Rockruff solo run gave me the opportunity to do so. My Pokemon solo runs are getting deeper by the game, and I'm lapping it up.Rockruff's move pool was not exceptional, I must admit: when it comes to offensive moves, the rocky canine can solely learn Normal, Rock, Dark and Fighting moves. However, this tiny variety of moves is more than compensated by the sheer power that all these moves pack. I spend the second half of the game cruising around with four powerful moves—one of each kind: Rock Slide (Rock), Crunch (Dark), Brick Break (Fighting) and Rock Climb (Normal). Combined with the corresponding Z-Crystals, these moves allowed me to tackle all situations and blaze through Alola, leaving a trail of fainted 'Mons  and crying Trainers in my wake. After successfully beating the crap out of the Elite Four and Professor Kukui, I started exploring postgame territory and went much further than usual. I captured the quartet of Guardian Deities as well as all the Extra Beasts on the loose, collected the missing Z-Crystals and gained a couple of extra levels before finally giving up after beating Blue in front of the Battle Tree. I wanted to climb that monument of grinding with my lv. 85 Lycanroc, but the rules implied that levels would be lowered to 50 upon entering the Tree, which was not to my liking at all. Like, do you want me to actually play fair and come up with strategies and well-balanced teams instead of one-shooting my way to the top? No way, game. Keep your stingy and illiberal Battle Tree; as for me, I'm off to new and exciting solo runs. It's worth noting that I played the french translation for a change; and oh boy, is it a million times better than the english one. Not only is the text brimming with jokes, witty comments and puns on 'Mons names, but the characters are also considerably more fleshed-out. For instance, Captain Ilima's snotty nature and obsession with his looks come across much more blatantly: I roared with laughter when Team Skull Grunts claimed that they didn't want his 'Mons because they \"reeked of conditioner\", or when Ilima himself told me he hoped my Island Challenge would bring me \"plenty of good things—like, a better haircut or fancier clothes\". There were also minor story elements that were not mentioned in the english translation and helped clarify a couple of things. Cherry on the cake, discovering a whole new body of text made me feel like I was playing a totally new game. I have nothing more to add, apart from the obvious: Rockruff is a perfect solo run candidate in Sun and Moon. He's not afflicted with the slowness that seems to plague most native Alolan 'Mons, he packs an awful lot of punch and his weaknesses can easily be managed. I would have loved to indulge in a Rockruff solo run of Moon; but unfortunately, Lycanroc's midnight form looks so goofy and dumb that I simply cannot imagine myself cruising Alola with that bipedal canine by my side. I've had my share of anthropomorphic 'Mons that look like they're lifted straight out of a saturday morning cartoon, thank you very much; and thus will my Rockruff solo run remain a Sun exclusive. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Aqua Kitty-Milk Mine Defender DX: Let's not get physical", "date": "22/01/2017", "text": "It's time to expose another dirty little secret, dear fellow gamers: I'm extremely fond of Shoot'em ups. Despite the fact that I didn't even play enough of these games throughout my gaming career to count them on the fingers of one hand, every single one I've played enthralled me and pretty much remained engraved in my memory for all eternity. So when I found Aqua Kitty on a PSN sale a couple of months ago, I simply had to purchase it. Because it's a Shoot'em up, and because cats. And I've been playing it lately not because I needed a fix of frantic shooting or cute felines, but rather because Limited Run Games are about to release a physical version of the game and I wanted to assess if it was worth the purchase.I had good hopes for that game, mind you. Not only is the premise of having kittens foraging for milk unbearably cute, but Aqua Kitty emulates one of my favourite and seldom-used shooting subgenres, i.e. horizontal aquatic shooting. I still have exhilarating memories of wreaking havoc on the marine fauna in level 2-3 in Super Mario Land on the Game Boy, and I fully expected to feel the same kind of giddy delight again in Aqua Kitty's cut-throat waters. I had also heard that the soundtrack was absolutely glorious, pure chiptune ear-candy; and I was more than ready to blast every swimming creature in sight while gorging on 8-bit aural goodness until my head swam.However, my actual gameplay experience with Aqua Kitty was nowhere near as frantic and elating as I had fantasized. My trip through the game's hazardous waters was a bit of a trudge, and this was solely due to questionable game design. Take the level design, for instance: instead of featuring an automatic scrolling, zones loop and can be navigated indifferently from left to right or right to left. While this gives the player a bit of leeway by letting them choosing their direction and speed, it also removes the stimulating feeling of urgency generated by an automatic scrolling. I found myself looping through the zones and meeting the same waves of pesky enemies over and over again until I got sick of them. And talking about enemies, they are the meat and potatoes of the game, since you can only exit a zone once you've been scouring it of all the resident pest. No rushing towards the end of the stage and dodging half of the aerial obstructions in heroic dashes in Aqua Kitty: you're basically a marine janitor, and you won't go anywhere until you've cleared all the trash floating around. I don't know about you, but I find that gameplay premise a tad anticlimactic.Aqua Kitty also suffers from the \"Seen Level One, Seen Them All\" syndrome. The entirety of the gameplay is concentrated in the first set of levels: you get your two types of ammunition from the get-go (weak unlimited ammo and strong limited ammo) as well as a briefing regarding gameplay objectives; then you polish off a couple of levels, fight a boss, and that's it. Rinse and repeat for the rest of the game, only with more waves of pesky enemies as the game goes on. Sure, these new foes boast fresh moving and shooting patterns; but at its core, the gameplay remains desperately unaltered. When you've played the first set of levels, you're pretty much  played them all; the rest is just flourish and extra enemies by the truckload. It doesn't help that said first set of levels is graced with what I deem the best track of the whole game (i.e. the wonderfully giddy and bouncy \"Buttermilk Bay\"), making these opening levels feel like a monument of perfection that the game never manages to top in its latter stages.And since I mentioned the music, does it deserve its stellar reputation? Oh yes, it does. It's highly reminiscent of the Ecco the Dolphin soundtrack, and it's bound to elicit tidal waves of nostalgia just by sheer virtue of its lush chiptunes that sound like a love affair between a Game Gear/Master System soundchip and a Megadrive one. It's not the game's only highlight, mind you: the controls are as tight, sharp and responsive as they can possibly be, without a shred of lag or delayed response to be found. And it would take a heart of stone not to melt when hearing the adorable \"mreow\" sound uttered by the feline miners when you rescue them from abducting jellyfishes. This leads us back to the original question: is Aqua Kitty worth a physical purchase, with shipping and toll fees involved? To put it simply, no. Sure, it has one of the most adorable premises ever created since the dawn of gaming and the best OST of the last two decades; but take away these two elements and Aqua Kitty loses fifty percent of its appeal. The gameplay is too shallow to offer any replay value beyond the challenge of clearing the game in the insanely hard Normal and Arcade modes, which I certainly won't do. Although this little aquatic feline odyssey was definitely fun to play, I can't really imagine myself picking up that game ever again now that I've cleared it. And so will Aqua Kitty forever remain a digital entry in my precious collection. On the other hand, I've purchased the OST, because it's freakin' awesome and it's stuck so deeply in my head that I simply had no other choice. Heck, I'm even listening to it as I'm wrapping up this post. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Nintendo Switch: The emperor's new clothes", "date": "16/01/2017", "text": "Watching the infamous Switch presentation didn't change my stance one bit when it comes to acquiring the console: I'm still determined to purchase it further down the line, when prices have decreased and the line-up of games has inflated. Nonetheless, I obviously have an opinion regarding the presentation and the console itself; and that opinion is genuinely mixed. The presentation did nothing to reassure me and make me more enthusiastic about the upcoming Switch; if anything, it made me more worried about the fortunes of Nintendo's newest piece of kit—and by extension the fortunes of handheld gaming as a whole.There were positive points, I must admit. The announcement that region-lock would be removed made me utter a big sigh of relief, and the prospect of getting some RPG titles brought a beaming smile to my lips. But once the joy of learning that I could resume my cosmopolitan collecting endeavours unhindered when I felt like it and that I would have some RPG goodness to enjoy wore out, the harsh and cold reality appeared in all its unholy glory. And boy, did it pour icy-cold water on my newfound enthusiam for the Switch.That harsh and cold reality is that despite Nintendo's bragging about the heavy third-party support they supposedly managed to secure, the Switch is so far a console bereft of games. The launch line-up is as anaemic as it gets, there are no surefire release dates for big third-party titles in 2017 and most of the appetizing games shown in the presentation seem to be still in the embryonic stages. You might say that this should not matter to me since I'm planning to purchase the Switch much later; and in a way, it does not. However, I'm still worried about the Switch's fortunes as a whole; because if it doesn't perform well from the get-go, some thrilling third-party game releases could be purely and simply canceled or end up never being developed as years go by. What worries me even more is Nintendo's insistence on showcasing the Switch's motion control gimmick and presenting it as a home console first and foremost. This is the exact opposite of the Switch trailer, which was presenting the system first and foremost as a portable console that could optionally be played on a TV screen; and all this to and fro makes me think that for all their bravado, Nintendo don't actually know what they are doing and what they are aiming for. The segment in which they clumsily attempted to present the Switch as a synthesis of all the Nintendo consoles ever released before is quite telling in that regard. At first, I though they were trying to capitalize on nostalgia for marketing purposes; but then, to my utter dismay, I realized that they may actually have been totally serious and have envisioned the Switch as a fusion of all the Nintendo console gimmicks ever created. That would sure explain the uncanny combination of motion controls, rumble technology, portable display, touchscreen capabilities, local multiplayer and whatnot; and that hotchpotch of features makes me genuinely worried. My fear is that by trying to have a finger in every pie and cater to all types of gamers, they will spread themselves too thin and end up catering to none of them in earnest. We would then end up with yet another WiiU fiasco—only with direr consequences, since it would also affect Nintendo's portable prospects.Or maybe not. Even if the Switch fails to compete with the PS4 and XBox One on the home console front, it could end up thriving as a portable console. If developing for it is as easy as rumor has it, I can totally envision developers focusing solely on the portable side of the Switch equation and showering it with games tailored for portable play—the type of games that would formerly have been released on the 3DS and Vita. For all we know, the Switch may even become the newest hideway for niche games after the Vita bails out. Now of course, that would imply minimal interference on Nintendo's part, which is not something I'm counting on. But I think we can all safely assume that if the Switch does indeed fail as a home console, Nintendo won't hesitate to hail it as the 3DS' successor and market it exclusively as a handheld.So yes, I'm worried about the Switch's fortunes and I'm quite sure Nintendo don't really know where they're going with this system. It seems that all rest on developers' shoulders now: they can pretty much make the Switch or break it, depending on what kind of games they will choose to develop for it—or on whether or not they choose to develop for it full stop. I think there's not much left to expect from Nintendo themselves: they've proven that far from having a crystal-clear vision of what the Switch should be, they are so lost at sea that they are potentially aiming for all gaming audiences at once and letting developers choose on which gimmick they want to focus. Only time will tell if the all-encompassing Switch was Nintendo's greatest stroke of genius or the final nail in the coffin, and I'll follow the upcoming Switch soap opera eagerly in the months and years to come. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sun: The Decidueye solo run", "date": "11/01/2017", "text": "A.k.a. my first-ever Grass Starter solo run, dear fellow gamers! Now, the reason why I always snubbed Grass Starters when considering potential candidates for solo runs is the exact same reason that made me choose Rowlet this time around: looks. Yes, I'm a fickle Pokemon player that chooses 'Mons for their appearance first and foremost; and Rowlet is the first Grass Starter that managed to catch and please my eye and make me want to pull off a Grass Starter solo run.I'm saying \"pull off\", because Grass Starters are traditionally not considered great solo run material. I'm always ready for a good challenge though, and I was quite eager to see for myself how tough it would prove to cruise Alola with the Grass owl. And surprise surprise, it didn't prove much more difficult than cruising Alola with its Fire counterpart. I'll go further and claim that Litten and Rowlet are virtual copy-pastes of each other when it comes to their final forms. Indeed, Decidueye and Incineroar have eerily similar stats, and that includes a ridiculously low Defense stat. That took me by surprise, I must say. I mean, I fully expect a Fire 'Mon to have low Defense, but a Grass 'Mon? I thought these guys were supposed to boast sky-high Defense, for Rotom's sake! To add insult to injury, Incineroar actually has higher Defense that Decidueye, which doesn't make any sense. Overall, Decidueye felt like a alternative version of Incineroar, only with slightly crappier stats and a different move pool.Although I fully enjoyed my Rowlet solo run, there's no denying that this 'Mon is not exactly stellar solo run material. Rowlet and his evolutions have one of the most miserable move pool I've ever encountered so far, and that tiny move pool severely restrained my enjoyment. I spent hours spamming the same old tired moves and desperately waiting for new fresh moves to come my way, only to be disappointed when half of them turned out to be defensive and buff moves. I would also have a lot to say about Decidueye's pitifully low HP, which put me in a bind more than once by sheer virtue of being so limited.  Once again, I had to resort to the massive use of Battle Items to punch my way through and stand a chance to finish the game with Decidueye as my One and Only.On the plus side, the Grass owl is a pretty memorable 'Mon that can lift up a whole solo run by sheer virtue of his colourful personality. Cute Rowlet is just too adorable to handle, coquettish Dartrix and his obsession with his hair is absolutely hilarious, and solemn-looking Decidueye oozes mystery and charisma—although Game Freak could have tried a tad harder to make him look like a genuine bird rather than like a man in a cheap bird suit. It's great to see a Grass Starter whose final evolution doesn't look completely goofy—if anything, Incineroar looks ten times goofier than Decidueye, despite the fact than Fire Starters are usually the ones blessed with badass final evolutions.Cruising around with Decidueye also gave me the rare opportunity to experiment with move categories. During the latter stages of my run, I had access to two powerful Ghost move dealing similar amounts of damage, namely Decidueye's signature move Spirit Shackle and TM move Shadow Ball. The trick is that Spirit Shackle is a physical move while Shadow Ball is a special move; and after my Decidueye learnt both of them, I had tons of fun experimenting with these two similar-yet-different moves and trying to determine which one was the best fitted for each 'Mon I had to pummel into oblivion—erm, situation. This is the first time I've ever taken this aspect into account, and it may well be the last time for all I know; but at any rate, it was a welcome discovery and it helped make the late stages of my run more exciting and rewarding.All in all, this was a pleasant and entertaining solo run despite the Grass Owl's inherent limitations. I'd lie if I said that this solo run made me want to cruise around again with Grass 'Mons; but I'd also lie if I claim that it put me off all 'Mons grassy. Only time will tell if I ever tackle another Grass Starter solo run; but for now, I'm firmly planning to cruise Alola yet again with Popplio, thus making the Sun/Moon pair the first Pokemon games I've ever roamed solo with all three Starters. I've been playing Sun until now, but I will switch to Moon for that third solo run, as well as switch to a male trainer for a change. See you soon for more solo run goodness, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sun: The Incineroar solo run", "date": "06/01/2017", "text": "It should surprise no one that my first solo run of Pokemon Sun starred the feisty Fire Starter Litten. Because, you know, cats. Fire Starters are not my favourites when it comes to solo runs, but the fiery kitten was the obvious choice and did a fine job during the 17 hours I spent cruising Alola by his side.I can safely claim that this solo run was the hardest and most challenging Pokemon solo run I've ever tackled. It was even harder than my Purrloin solo run of Black, and that's saying something given that Purrloin is overall a crappy 'Mon whose evolution Liepard belongs to the NeverUsed Tier. The difficulty level was definitely ramped up in Sun and Moon, and the game's wide array of Trials, Captains, Totem Pokemons and random Trainers roughed me up on a regular basis. Even more telling, my Litten-turned-Incineroar only boasted a paltry Lv. 64 when I finally reached the Elite Four headquarters, which is just the most unusual thing ever; at this point in the game, my lone 'Mons usually boast levels between 90 and 100 and can pretty much one-shot their way to the champion accolade. Not so in that case; I had to fight 'Mons that were a mere ten levels below me, and believe me, it was a struggle.Not that I would let ramped-up difficulty stop me, mind you; before long, I had found a brilliant and reliable solution to get myself out of any bind and compensate for my Litten's weaknesses. This solution was none other than the regular and diligent use of some items I had neglected until now, i.e. Battle Items. Anytime I had trouble with a battle, I stuffed and buffed up my Litten with X Attacks, X Defense and the like, and voilà! Formerly impassable battles suddenly became manageable and I could progress unhindered. I can shamelessly claim that I would never have taken down the Elite Four and the Champion without those wonderful Battle Items, and I'm immensely grateful for their very existence. And now that I've learnt to assess their wonderfulness, I can go back to my unfinished Purrloin solo run of Black and finally put an end to it with the help of a huge stock of X-whatever.Litten's move pool was decently varied, but not staggeringly so; and while his double typing was interesting, it didn't hold a lot of novelty for me given that I had already played a solo run with a Dark-type Cat Pokemon. Is there some kind of hidden rule at Game Freak stipulating that all feline 'Mons must belong to the Dark type? Anyway, I had already wielded Dark moves on a regular basis and knew them well enough to be a bit blasé towards Litten's ability to learn them. I was also not impressed by the teeny-tiny number of Fire moves Litten can learn over the course of his evolution: we're talking about a meagre four moves there, and I don't think it's enough for a Fire 'Mon. More fire moves can be learnt through the use of TMs, but one must get their paws on them first, and I have to admit that I didn't perform honorably when it comes to acquiring these precious items and thus ended up with a very small choice of Fire moves.I also have to admit that for all my love for Litten and his middle evolution Torracat, I had a shock when he finally crossed the ultimate evolutionary threshold. When Incineroar appeared before my incredulous and horrified eyes, I had to fight a very strong urge to turn off the game, erase my save file and try to forget I had ever witnessed that. I mean, how did this happen? How did we go from Love Meow to John Cena in a single evolution? That's certainly not how I expected Torracat to evolve, and it took me a very long time to get used to Incineroar's deviant art-infused design. It certainly didn't help matters that I had to repeatedly massage the creature's heavily muscled chest during the Pokemon Refresh sequences, making me feel like I had gotten myself stranded in a bad case of fanfiction. But hey, time heals all wounds, and I finally managed to get used to Incineroar's questionable design and to stroke his bulging muscles without cringing. Thanks a lot, Game Freak, for giving me the unforgettable opportunity to get up close and personal with an humanoid cat looking like Machamp's long-lost brother. I'll remember that solo run, oh yes I will.Game Freak's dubious design choices aside, my Litten solo run of Sun was a fairly entertaining one. It was so entertaining, in fact, that I started exploring postgame segments with enthusiam, before realizing that what I really wanted was to relive the early stages of the game with another 'Mon. I thus started another solo run with another Starter; and that's a story I'll tell you in my next run report, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Coveted games: 2017 a.k.a. the grand finale", "date": "03/01/2017", "text": "Dear fellow gamers, I wish you all the best for 2017! May this brand-new year be full of delights, accomplishments and successes, in gaming as in other fields. We'll obviously focus on gaming here, as I'll lay down my gaming hopes and plans for 2017. Without further ado, let's get started!One thing is pretty obvious as I'm writing this: 2017 will mark the end of my collecting endeavours, at least for the time being. My collecting pace already slowed down considerably last year, and it will slow down even more over the next months. My prognosis is that by the end of 2017, my 3DS purchases will have trickled to nothing as the 3DS will be quietly yet firmly ousted to make room for the Switch; as for Vita purchases, they will probably have become occasional occurrences by the time 2018 rolls in.But like I've said before, my ultimate collecting moments will be glorious ones. I have a massive list of coveted titles for the first half of 2017, with the Vita playing the star role. See for yourself all the goodness I'm planning to get my greedy paws on: Fate Extella, Akiba's Beat, The Nonary Games, Mary Skelter, God Wars, Period Cube, Hakuoki Kyoto Winds, Danganronpa V3, Operation Babel, plus any digital-only game that will capture my interest. On the 3DS, there is unfortunately very little on my radar, with only Dragon Quest XI, Ever Oasis and maybe the upcoming Story of Seasons on the purchasing horizon; but maybe a couple of interesting releases will pop up in the months to come. Fingers crossed!This leads us to my localizations wishes, which are quite reasonable. I'm only pinning for two games, one for each system: Ys-Lacrimosa of Dana and Etrian Odyssey V. If I get this duo, I can bid the Vita and 3DS farewell with a serene heart. And lucky me, there are actually good chances that we'll indeed get these two games, if Nihon Falcom's and Atlus' track records when it comes to localizations are any indication. And while I'm mentioning Etrian Odyssey, I wonder if a remake of Etrian Odyssey III: will ever come to life. Atlus remade the first two DS entries, so it would make perfect sense to remake the third as well; but on the other hand, the 3DS is on its last legs and maybe they don't want to bother with a dying console. Oh, well; 2017 will tell, I guess.2017 will also certainly tell if the Switch lives up to the hype and turns out to be a resounding success. I'll follow the fortunes of Ninty's newest piece of kit very closely, and I may even write a couple of posts about it if I'm inspired. But you know my plans, dear fellow gamers: no Switch will join my collection in 2017, and the next months will be all about exploring the depths of my current treasure trove of games.So that's 2017 in a nutshell: watching the Switch from a comfortable distance, getting my paws on the ultimate games that pique my interest and enjoying all the great games I managed to secure over the last five years. As my collecting days are slowly but surely coming to an end, it's now time to lay back and enjoy my hard-earned games without worrying about game-hunting. Goodbye custom fees and endless internet browsing and hello long gaming and blogging sessions! Hopefully I'll keep you entertained along the way, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Sun/Moon: A departure", "date": "28/12/2016", "text": "Greetings and Merry Christmas to you all, dear fellow gamers! I've been writing about general gaming matters since the beginning of december, and you may wonder if I've been playing any game at all during that time. Well, the answer is yes: as a matter of fact, I've been pretty engrossed by a single game these last weeks, and that game is none other than the newly released Pokemon Sun. I've been polishing off two playthroughs of it already, and run reports are very much in the pipeline. But for the time being, I want to write about my overall impression of the game and analyze the many changes it packs in its tiny cartridge. Without further ado, let's dissect the newest Pokemon beast together! (Slight SPOILERS ahead!)The Sun/Moon pair means a lot to me, because they are the first brand-new Pokemon entries released since I discovered the series in 2014. I've been waiting and pinning for them with a lot of trepidation and anticipation; and oh boy, did they gloriously fulfill my expectations. I can proudly claim that Sun and Moon are my favourite Pokemon entries ever and that insular Alola managed to charm and enrapture me like no other Pokemon region ever did. Heck, cruising through Alola even awakened in me an overwhelming desire to visit its real-life inspiration and gorge on deliciously real malasadas.The early stages of my exploration of Sun, however, were not that glorious: in fact, my initial feelings about the Alolan entries were lukewarm at best. The excessive linearity, constant hand-holding and abundance of cutscenes were a shock to my system, and I think the only reason I was able to soldier through the first hours of the game without ditching it entirely before writing a scathing review was because my levels of energy were still quite low at the time and could thus accommodate an overbearing game. And that's all for the best, because once I managed to accept that this was the newest Pokemon fashion and got fully used to it, I fell head over heels in love with Alola. I love the rural insular setting of that new region and the fact that it sports no huge and confusing city like entries from generations V and VI. I love the fact that Alola is so cosy and welcoming, with a nice variety of pint-sized landscapes that don't take hours to explore. I love the gentle atmosphere and the fact that the locals are so hell-bent on collaborating and welcoming a complete stranger like me. Feeling like a foreigner and being routinely challenged by locals in a slightly antagonistic way in former Pokemon entries was a thrilling experience, but I definitely prefer the comfy, heartwarming and welcoming vibe of Sun and Moon, in which every NPC treats me as an important part of the community. (Of course, it certainly doesn't hurt that one of the local Guardian Deities entrusted me with a Sparkling Stone that let me use D-moves five minutes after I set foot on Alola, thus making me a kahuna in all but name, now does it?) I love this friendliness so much that I simply cannot help but go out of my way to chat with every single NPC in Alola.Given that Alolans are so open and friendly, it makes perfect sense that the game won't pit you against a hot-blooded rival this time around. For all the wild speculations on the internet regarding the rival matter—going from the notion that your character is actually supposed to play the role of the rival towards Hau to the idea that your real and true rival is Professor Kukui—we have to face the truth here: there is no traditional rival in Pokemon Sun and Moon. Hau is way too friendly to be a rival, all the more so as he chooses the starter that's weak against your own. Gladion appears too unfrequently to be considered a true rival and has his own goals that have nothing to do with becoming the strongest trainer around. As for Professor Kukui, he fights you only once and does so as the resident champion. Sun and Moon take away the good old rival figure and replace it with a variety of antagonists that fight you for various reasons and are nowhere near as aggressive and determined to beat the crap out of you as the rivals of old. And boy, is that refreshing. As much as I enjoyed showing over-confident pricks à la Barry who was the boss, I relish this change of pace in all things rivalry. The resident villain team was also treated to a much-needed makeover. Let's face it: although they are initially designed to be threatening, villain teams always come across as foolish and slightly pathetic. Game Freak seem to have noticed this pattern and taken it in their stride; this time around, they created a team of villains that were very blatantly designed as laughing stocks, with hilarious behaviours and one-liners that bring a lot of humour into the game. On the other hand, they introduced a villain team in disguise in the shape of the Aether Foundation employees, whose rigid ethos and self-righteous behaviours, constant meddling and too pristine outfits are bound to elicit unease and suspicion—which turn out to be totally justified. It is later revealed that the two teams work hand in hand for very mundane reasons; and although they do some harm over the course of the game, neither of them are as inherently evil and rotten as teams from former entries, which is a welcome change of tone.That leads us to the story, which is considerably more fleshed-out than your usual Pokemon romp. No more \"take that pokedex and become the strongest trainer out there\", no more teams of villains with murky and far-fetched motives; this time, your trainer gets to interact with characters that have believable goals and sound reasons to act the way they do. Sun and Moon's storyline is surprisingly grounded and well put together, and all the characters turn out to be pleasantly relatable. Instead of dealing with guru-like team leaders that want to get their paws on godly 'Mons for purposes unfathomable to anyone but themselves, we are confronted with a slightly insane wealthy woman who collects pokemons she deems perfect for her own selfish enjoyment. In a region so intent on cooperating and helping one another as Alola, this comes across as the ultimate treason and a potentially dangerous behaviour that must be stopped at any cost—and that's obviously a job for your trainer, along with many helpers. I was very fond of that simple yet well-constructed story, although I could have done with slightly less cutscenes and hand-holding along the way, as well as a trifle less linearity. This is the first Pokemon entry in which the story moves you forward instead of the opposite, and I cannot help but feel a bit sorry for all the players whose primary purpose is the hunting and breeding of 'Mons and who must endure heavy amounts of narrative to reach the next area in line.I can't avoid mentioning the biggest change of them all, namely the ousting of Gyms. The streamlined and compact Gym structure with its unmovable eight milestones has been replaced by the much looser Trial structure. The core goal is still the same, i.e. fighting strong Trainers and 'Mons and ultimately getting the upper hand as well as an item that will prove your victory beyond any doubt; however, Trials have a much more roundabout way to lead you towards that goal. They come in all shapes and sizes, involve a wide variety of endeavours and are scattered around the islands in uneven numbers. All this makes them much more unpredictable than the Gyms of old and thus quite refreshing for veteran players. Although I slightly miss the thrill of taking one Gym after the other in an neat and orderly fashion, I have to admit that the Trial structure is a stimulating change of pace that's perfectly suited to the more rural and insular nature of the Alolan region to boot.What's highly interesting about these changes is that they all target unexpected features and aspects of the series. Pokefans have been calling for many changes over the years, but I was never aware that there were massive pleas to change the Gym system, the rival dynamic or the narrative. All these changes were not only not demanded, but also not inherently needed: Pokemon games just worked fine the way they did and could have kept doing so. These massive changes in areas that were not in dire need of changes can be interpreted as a message from Game Freak, and by extension Nintendo. They are basically telling us that this time, they mean business and are ready to usher a new era. This is consistent with the changes that could be spotted in other upcoming entries of Nintendo IPs, such as the open world of Breath of the Wild, and it's also consistent with the innovative and revolutionary image of the Switch. Nintendo have being consistently accused of resting on their laurels and recycling their old gaming formulas ad nauseam during the whole 3DS and WiiU era, and they obviously want to silence such criticism for good and prove that they can evolve if they put their mind to it. I'm curious—and a bit anxious, I admit—to see where this brand-new direction will lead them; although this could bring some welcome innovations to the fold, I fervently hope that I won't ever have to suffer through an open-world Pokemon instalment.These were my overall feelings about Sun and Moon, but I'm far from being done with these games, both in playing and writing. I'll see you very soon with more Alolan goodness, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pondering portable gaming prospects (2)", "date": "23/12/2016", "text": "After having pondered the evolution of portable gaming until now, it's time to unroll my informed speculations regarding its future. 2017 is going to be a paramount year for portable gaming, because it's very likely over the course of that year that we are going to find out whether portable gaming as we currently know it has a chance to survive or not.But before we even get there, we have to face the sad truth: 2017 will certainly mark the end of the 3DS' shelf life. Although Nintendo claim that they will continue to support the system after the release of the Switch, anybody who's been following them for more than a console generation knows that such promises are as empty as the Virtual Boy gaming library. If their track record regarding older console support is any indication, they will support the 3DS for a couple of months and then ditch it without a second though. In this particular case, they will probably wait until the handful of games that are still in development are released and then announce the end of the 3DS production. All this will likely take place before the end of 2017, and that means that we may well end up missing a couple of appetizing localizations in the process. For instance, I'm not too sure that games like Etrian Odyssey V and Monster Hunter Diary will arrive on our shores, unless publishers pull off tardy releases à la Devil Survivor 2. At any rate, the tiny number of slated 3DS releases for 2017 is quite telling: the 3DS is on its last legs and heading towards retirement, sooner rather than later. Although it's far from being my favourite portable console of all times, I'm a little bit sad at the though that Nintendo's ultimate dedicated portable system is about to go retro.The question is, will the 3DS bail out alone or will it do so alongside the console that should have been its main competitor but never managed to rise up to the challenge, a.k.a. the Vita? Nothing seems to be clear-cut when it comes to the immediate future of the unofficial sanctum and anchorage for all games quircky and nichey, as Sony steadily refuses to mention the console at official events or comment on its possible future. While this snubbing is infuriating, it can also be interpreted in a positive way: as long as Sony is uttering no word about the Vita, they are at least not announcing the end of its production. And since they have no planned successor to their unloved portable, the Vita may actually endure longer that the 3DS and enjoy a much longer pre-retirement period. Indeed, there are tons of Vita games slated for physical release in 2017, both in Japan and in the West; and it's not a stretch to assume that the Vita will manage to survive until the beginning of 2018—maybe even until late 2018 or early 2019. Despite pitifullly failing to fulfill Sony's expectations, the Vita has managed to carve itself a niche and to build up a small but devoted and passionate fan base, both in Japan and in the West. The type of games that are currently gracing the Vita can't be found on any other console, and there is undoubtedly a market for such games; this is why I can envision the Vita going strong—in the niche acception of the word—for a couple of extra years, supported by developers and publishers that won't find any better outlet for their budget niche games. In the best possible scenario, niche Vita releases will keep going until the market dries up and Sony will abstain from interfering, offering the black sheep of its console line-up a pleasant and peaceful departure—and boy, isn't that the least they can do after ignoring it for years.But regardless of how long the Vita clings to life, the survival of our beloved current brand of portable gaming is still at stake; and it hinges entirely on how the upcoming Switch will perform and how third-party developers will handle it—making Nintendo once again THE company that will single-handedly make portable gaming or break it. We've reached a point where portable console gaming and home console gaming have become vastly different experiences, so much so that they should be discussed separately; and in what can only be described as a giant display of irony, they have somehow switched places over time. Portable gaming has claimed for itself the variety and boldness that used to characterize home console gaming back in the days, and home console gaming has shrunk and become just as lacklustre and samey as portable gaming used to be in its early stages. Home console gaming has become overcautious, tired and crusty while portable gaming is the avant-garde bristling with dynamism, and it's up to future Switch developers to maintain the latter's edge. If things turn out right, the Switch can even bring a breath of fresh air to home console gaming and shake it from its hyperrealistic AAA slumber.In the most gloriously optimistic scenario, current 3DS and Vita developers will massively flock to the Switch and focus solely on the portable side of Ninty's all-in-one console, thus ignoring home console standards entirely and releasing games similar to the ones they've been releasing on former portable systems. Just because the Switch can behave like a home console doesn't mean that all developers must take that possibility into account and that every Switch game must abide to home console criteria. After all, many developers have a track record of diligently ignoring Nintendo's and Sony's gimmicks du jour, developing games as though dual screen, touch screens and stereoscopic 3D were never a thing; and they can keep ignoring Ninty's latest flight of fancy if they want to. Portable gaming would thus coexist peacefully with home console gaming on a single system; and if such a cohabitation turns out to be fruitful for all parties involved, it could definitely set a new standard for gaming consoles and encourage other hardware manufacturers to cross the Rubicon and start producing similar all-in-one systems that can cater to all brands of gaming.In the most depressingly pessimistic scenario, most current 3DS and Vita developers won't make to move to the Switch, and those who do will ditch the current brand of portable gaming without a second though and start catering to the home console audience by releasing games bristling with open worlds, camera fiddling and attempts at hyperrealism. The portable games of the last twelve years will be dismissed as pitiful by-products of technical limitations and the whole console industry will bow down to home console standards. In such a case, the Switch will probably underperform dramatically compared to its counterparts and scare away potential developers, thus ending up as yet another third party games-deserted fiasco. And given that Nintendo are about to ditch the 3DS and fuse their home console and portable console departments in what is arguably the boldest and most dangerous move in their history, they will be left with no flourishing portable console department to fall back on and will most definitely go belly up for good. Between these two extremes stands the reasonably realistic scenario, in which Nintendo and a handful of third-party developers will occasionally release the odd game inspired by former portable console standards, thus transforming the present-day brand of portable gaming into a niche of sorts. Mind you, there are actually a lot of clues pointing to that outcome to be found in the current home console landscape, as we are now seeing home consoles being graced with games that would have remained confined to the realm of portable gaming a couple of years ago. Sonic Mania, Mighty No. 9, Nitroplus Blasterz, Digimon Story Cybersleuth, every indie game ever Kickstarted into existence: you name them, the home consoles have them—and portable consoles more and more often don't, which is just the weirdest situation ever. It's like home console gaming is trying to reclaim its long-forgotten diversity and taste for innovation while at the same time attempting to put portable gaming back in the place that it left so long ago, i.e. in the shadow of all TV-tied consoles. In such a scenario, the current brand of portable gaming, which is very much its own entity, would merge into home console gaming, and Gaming with a capital G would be unified once again under the old banner of home console gaming, with portable gaming being reduced to a mere hardware option like back in the days.The Switch does have the potential to give birth to these three scenarios, which is just the most dizzying and overwhelming feeling. It's not a coincidence that analyses and commentaries are describing the Switch both as a portable console that can be plugged to a TV screen and as a home console with an extra portable display; just like Schrodinger's cat, the Switch is actually both of these things as long as it's not released. Only time, developer support and actual games will determine the destiny of the Switch, and by extension the destiny of portable gaming as a gaming trend of its own.It goes without saying that I will follow the Switch's performances very closely. I don't think I've ever been that eager to see how a Nintendo console will perform, which is quite ironic given that I'm not even planning to buy the thing in the next years. Nevertheless, the Switch's fate will determine if I have to retreat into the solace of retro gaming for good or if the gaming industry still have some juicy bites to offer me, and it's definitely something I'm anxious to find out. The die is cast, and we'll see which number pops up. In the meantime, I'll enjoy my precious collection, give my bank account a well-deserved rest and keep writing about games for my pleasure and yours, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pondering portable gaming prospects (1)", "date": "19/12/2016", "text": "Portable gaming has been my holy land ever since I started playing video games. From Game&Watches to my beloved Gameboy to my expectation-shattering Vita, I've seen portable gaming evolve in ways I could never have imagined when I first laid my thumb on a D-pad. And right now, after more than twenty-five years of portable gaming growth, we are standing at a crossroad. An ominous crossroad, shall I say, because it will determine whether portable gaming as we currently know it will endure or disappear. And boy, wouldn't that be a pity to see portable gaming disappear now that it finally managed to reach its peak after years spent in the shadow of home console gaming. Indeed, it took portable gaming quite a bit of time to mature and reach its full bloom. Portable consoles were initially low-fi versions of their more popular and flashier home counterparts, with game libraries made of downgraded versions of more popular and flashier home consoles games. Game releases were usually simultaneous, with each home console game getting its budget, barren equivalent on portable consoles. Home console gaming was running the game (indeed) at the time, with portable gaming following suit as a mere extension—or as an afterthough in some cases. Exclusive portable games were few and far between, and they either took their cues from home console gaming or were conceived as experiments that would have cost too much to produce on home consoles. (Think Final Fantasy Legend II or the original Pokemon Red and Green for examples of such safe bets.)Things started to change with the Gameboy Color. At the time of its release, home console games had become too advanced to be squeezed into portable cartridges, be it with a lot of downgrading. The Gameboy Color and portable gaming as a whole had to find a new avenue if they wanted to keep striving and prospering—or even if they wanted to survive full stop. The genius solution at the time was to turn to NES ports and remakes from the former gaming generations, peppered with a couple of exclusive games blatantly inspired by 16-bit gaming. This potent mix worked as a charm and allowed the Gameboy Color to enjoy a decent lifetime; but most importantly, it instigated the separation between home console gaming and portable gaming and paved the way for an independant brand of portable gaming that would be a viable alternative to home console gaming.The Gameboy Advance solidified these advancements and took portable gaming even further away from its home console counterpart. Retro gaming was growing in popularity at the time, and the GBA cleverly surfed the nostalgia wave by offering all at once lush ports and remakes of SNES games and brand-new games that emulated 16-bit era gaming. It's no coincidence that the GBA has been dubbed \"the SNES emulator\"; its whole library is basically one giant homage to 16-bit home console gaming. This planted the idea that portable gaming was somehow bound to hark back to older gaming eras and to revive dead gaming trends; and oh boy, did it indeed do so in the years that followed the GBA's retirement.Let's face it: the last twelve years have been the Halcyon Days of portable gaming. We're talking about the seventh and eighth generation of consoles here, and they saw portable gaming reach its full maturity and peak as a gaming trend, with more dedicated systems and games to choose from than ever before. 2004 marked the glorious release of both the DS and PSP, two systems that would be instrumental in making portable console gaming its own glorious entity. They introduced a staggering variety of gaming genres and gaming experiences, from convincing copies of AAA games to much more niche games and everything in between, without forgetting remakes and ports from former generations. Even better, they actually revived genres that were dead and buried, such as hardcore 2D platformers and first-person dungeon crawlers. No console under the gaming sun can claim a gaming library as wide and varied as the DS' and PSP's ones, which span every single gaming genre and subgenre ever created.Two consoles come very close though, and that's obviously the 3DS and the Vita. The proud successors to the DS and PSP refined the thriving unique brand of portable gaming established by their elders by getting rid of most of the shovelware that plagued the DS and PSP gaming libraries and focusing on genres that portable gamers lapped up and wanted to play more of. The Vita throwed itself into niche gaming full force and became the unofficial haven and refuge for all games quircky, nichey, fan-servicey and budgety; as for the 3DS, it gave gamers more of what they wanted to play the most by releasing lovingly crafted entries of the most successful DS series and ditching less popular franchises without a second thought. Remakes and ports were still going strong, keeping alive the portable gaming tradition of maintaining fruitful ties to the past—although at that point, they were starting to feel more like quick cash-ins than like shout-outs to former gaming eras. The 3DS and Vita offered a wide variety of games while keeping an sharper eye on quality control; their gaming libraries are like upgraded and honed versions of their predecessors' ones, in which only the best gaming formulas have been kept and fine-tuned until they become the creme de la creme.These glorious and peaceful days of portable gaming may be about to come to an end, though. As I mentioned before, we are standing at a crossroad, and the next years will determine the fate of portable gaming. The question is: will portable gaming as we currently know it endure? Will it maintain its nichey, budgety aspect, its staggering variety and its independance from home console gaming, or will it be absorbed by stronger gaming trends and dissolve entirely, leaving nothing behind but fond memories and dusty cartridges coveted by wistful retro gamers? As Nintendo is about to unleash an all-in-one console upon the world and Sony is planning no successor for the Vita, it's now time for informed speculations regarding the future of the brand of portable gaming that we currently know and love.And you know what, dear fellow gamers? I'll actually unroll these informed speculations in another post, because this one is getting close to being dangerously stuffy. You won't have to wait long though, because the whole thing is pretty much mapped out in my head as I'm writing. I'll see you very soon for the end of my portable gaming musings, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Why I will wait a long time before buying the Nintendo Switch", "date": "11/12/2016", "text": "I have to admit it: for all my past rantings about Nintendo, I am currently interested in the Switch. Ever since the big reveal some weeks ago, I've being thinking that maybe, just maybe, that console could delight me after all. I mean, this is technically a portable system, and I'm a portable console aficionado; so there's really no reason I should write the Switch off, right? Well, things are not that straightforward. Although I am definitely pondering a purchase, that doesn't mean that said purchase has to happen Day One, or even Year One. Or year two, three or four, for that matter.Here's the thing: I am currently planning to let a good amount of time pass before I do purchase a Switch. In fact, I'm planning no less than to purchase a Switch at the very end of the console's lifetime, maybe even after production has stopped. Not only could I then take full advantage of the Switch's Pit, but that would also allow me to avoid a couple of pitfalls that are likely to be waiting for me if I purchase the Switch Day One. Without further ado, here are my very sound reasons to bide my time to get my paws on Ninty's all-in-one offering:Prices tags: Although I would solely use the Switch as a portable console if I buy one, there's no denying that this is actually a home console/portable console hybrid, with prices to match. The price tag of 300$ for the system alone is currently floating around the internet, and I have to admit that such a price tag is a trifle too high for my taste. I never invested that much money in a gaming system ever and I'm not ready to start now. And that's without even talking about the games, which will probable come with price tags anywhere between 60$ and 80$. I'm really not ready to fork out that much cash to get my paws on the Switch and its gaming library, hence my decision to wait for the end of the console's lifetime and the concomitant price dips to invest in the whole package.Prospective game library: Although many third-party developers have come forward and claimed that they fully support Nintendo and the upcoming Switch, such claims are little more than declarations of intent at this point. Real, actual games still have to be confirmed; and for all we know, the Switch may end up being totally bereft of third-party support and suffer the same fate as the WiiU. Given that 95% of my Nintendo gaming libraries are made of third-party games, I'd rather wait patiently until such games do indeed turn up on the Switch before considering a purchase. Because let's be honest, I'm not a great fan of most of Nintendo's IP and I certainly wouldn't purchase a Switch just to play Pokemon. Release schedule: Even if third-party developers lavish the Switch with great games and if every single franchise that ever released games for the DS, 3DS and Vita move on to the Switch, it's highly likely that the release pace of all these games will be much slower than it used to be on older portable systems. We're talking about a home console of sorts, after all, and it can be expected to follow home console standards when it comes to development times and release schedule. As a long-time portable gamer, I've been pampered with rapid-fire releases that delivered at least two or three entries of each franchise on every system, sometimes more. That makes one game per year, or one game every two years at the worst; and now that I'm fully used to this release pace, I don't want to switch gears and spend many a year pinning for a series' newest entry. I'd much rather wait until the Switch runs its course and then purchase all the games that interest me at once. And gee, wouldn't that be the most amazing shopping spree of them all. I'm nearly looking forward to it, actually. Call of the backlog: After five amazing years of intensive collecting, I'm sitting on a nice, big fat collection of games that are begging to be played. And you know what? I'm in the mood to humour them—and myself in the process. After five years spent ordering games, waiting impatiently for them and wasting spending unspeakable amounts of money in custom fees, I am now ready to sit back, relax and enjoy my hard-earned games. By the time the Switch bails out, my game purchasing drive will probably have returned full force and it will be a great delight to indulge in a massive orgy of Switch-related purchases. Until then, I'll enjoy my collection to the fullest as a full-time retro gamer. Once bitten, twice shy: After Nintendo's shenanigans during the 3DS and WiiU era, I know better than to jump blindly on any new console they release. Ninty has a lot to answer for as far as I'm concerned, and they really have to step up their game in a major way if they want to get me on board again. I'm thus waiting, and watching. If they get rid of the cursed region-lock, pick up the pace when it comes to game development and releases, stop cutting games in pieces and releasing them as standalone games, drop the excessive gimmickry and cut the crap with the artificial shortages, then I'll be more than glad to invest in their stuff again. If they don't, then I'm out for good. You get the point, dear fellow gamers: if I do indeed end up purchasing a Switch, it will be by the time the Switch is about to go retro. This is actually a bit of a pattern in my gaming life: I'm just as likely to invest and indulge in a console's library after said console's prime is over than during said console's heyday. And when I say \"just as likely\", I mean it literally: half of all the systems I ever purchased were acquired during the console's official lifetime, and the other half right after the console bailed out. There's something oddly comforting in purchasing a system and its library as another console generation is about to kick in: not only does it spare you the fake hype, the long waiting times between game releases and the sky-high prices, but it nearly makes you feel like a savior of sorts for taking in a forlorn console that nobody wants anymore. Only time will tell if I will end up adopting a Switch; in the meantime, I'll go full retro and keep playing and reviewing games from the last four console generations. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Code:Realize: Fifty shades of frustration", "date": "01/12/2016", "text": "A.K.A. the route report I promised you, dear fellow gamers. My drive to write about Code:Realize is drying up fast, so I'll wrap this up nicely and tighly before said drive entirely evaporates. Without further ado, let's get to it! (SPOILERS ahead!)Impey: I had very low expectations regarding the crew's token goof's route, but Impey's route pleasantly surprised me. It packs a lot of action as well as some really interesting character development. Goofy Impey turns out to be much deeper than expected and Cardia gets to show a lot of courage and to mature accordingly. Although the two often feel more like friends than like lovers, there's no denying that the chemistry between them is really good and that they make a jolly good pair. All in all, this whole route reminded me a lot of Jules Verne's most hectic books, which is more than fitting given that a lot of the route's narrative elements are lifted straight from Jules Verne's oeuvre. Heck, playing this route even made me want to reread Journey to the Center of the Earth, my favourite Jules Verne book ever! I would definitely rank this route in my top favourites, and it may have been my ultimate favourite route if not for the fact that Impey and Cardia don't get to consumate their relationship. I'm still pissed off about this whole abstinence thing, I really am. Saint-Germain: Bizarre is the right word to describe this route. It boasts some narrative developments that come completely out of left field as well as some character development that's, well, totally out of character. It starts with a bout of unexpected confinement—or maybe not so unexpected, because it seems that every Otomate game must feature confinement of the heroine in at least one of the routes—and it ends with a fight between immortal beings on London Bridge, with tons of uncanny events in between. This route left a very weird taste in my mouth, and the forced abstinence that popped up once again certainly didn't alleviate my distaste for it.Van Helsing: Oh, what a torture! Playing this route was as pleasant as whipping myself with nettles or jumping head first in brambles. Van Helsing is by far the most antipathic, rude and disgraceful character I've encountered in an otome game. He's neither a tsundere not an ice queen; tsundere are sometimes nice and ice queens can be defrosted, but Van Helsing remains cold and rude to Cardia throughout the whole route. He's a bloody iceberg, that's what he is, with not defrosting in sight whatsoever. He doesn't show a shred of affection towards Cardia, and it was seriously depressing to see him rebuff her time and time again. Even worse, Van Helsing doesn't even have the decency to deal with his heavy past in a graceful way. Unlike the other guys, who carry their own personal burden with dignity and soberness, Van Helsing faces his past sins with anger, bitterness and a lot of whining. And guess on whom he vents his frustration and pent-up rage? Why, on poor little Cardia, of course! So much for the love he claims to feel for her. If that's what love means for this guy, then he doesn't deserve my lovely, sweet Cardia. And he's not gonna get the whole of her anyway, because forced abstinence is once again part and parcel of this route. Victor: Well, I certainly didn't expect that. Who would have thought that this route would turn out to be the most perfect and fulfilling of the bunch? Victor and Cardia have it all: the connection, the chemistry, the tenderness, the loving and comforting words and, last but certainly not least, the kisses and whatever comes in their wake. Yup, innocent-looking Victor gets some, and that's probably the biggest plot twist in the whole game. Anyway, the alchemy between Victor and Cardia is amazing and their love story is heart-warming. They care for each other deeply and they show it blatantly in the sweetest and most honest way. What's not to love, seriously? The rest of the narrative is also deeply satisfying, with a lot of intense moments and an overall atmosphere that's a perfect mix of sadness, hope and gentleness. Absolution is a strong theme in this route, and it  packs an interesting plot twist that only serves to increase the bond between Victor and Cardia. Cherry on the cake, the route hints at the fact that Queen Victoria could also have a chance at love, which was a nice touch. This route is my favourite and the one that touched me the most, and probably the only one I would bother replaying if I ever pick up Code:Realize again.Lupin: The one True Route, the one that should have wrapped things up in the most satisfying way and failed to do so. For one thing, Lupin is not a very convincing love interest. It's clear that the developers wanted to create a well-rounded bachelor that would potentially appeal to all players; unfortunately, Lupin is so well-rounded and middle-of-the-road that he ends up being painfully transparent. It's hard to figure out his personality and what makes him tick—so much so that I didn't manage to nail his true ending on my first try like I did with the four other routes. The sad truth is that there is really not much to Lupin beyond his playful bragging, cape flourishes and mademoiselle, and even his supposedly painful past pales when compared to his counterparts' hurdles. To make matters worse, the chemistry between him and Cardia is non-existent: if anything, they feel more like long-lost siblings than like lovers, and the cliché wedding at the end of the route doesn't change that fact one bit, nor does the fact that they have the rare privilege to be able to enjoy physical intimacy. As for Cardia's story, the least that can be said is that it doesn't end up in a satisfying way. There is no logic whatsoever to the fact that her father didn't keep her at his side at all times, and the whole concept of him being somehow transformed in a big ball of something and about to become a new God falls completely flat. How about something less far-fetched and not dripping so much in ad hoc and deux ex machina, game? I cannot take that conclusion seriously at all because it's too damn improbable, even when taking the nature of the story into account. I mean, even the most fanciful fantastic story must have a modicum of coherence to function properly. Otherwise, you can just throw anything into the mix—aliens, furries, Jedis, Cthulhu, whatever gets you out of a narrative bind—and call it a day. And now that I think of it, isn't there a logical fallacy in the act of sticking the Horologium in Cardia's body? Since the story establishes that the stone needs to spend some time in a living body to reach its full potential and is the very thing that keeps Cardia alive in the first place, why not stick it in Finis' chest, since Isaac seemingly hates him so much? Why give it to the clone of its supposedly beloved daughter, knowing that she will die the moment the Horologium is ripped out of her chest? Yeah, I know the answer: because the game wouldn't have existed otherwise. Now that's tautology at its best, and I don't like it much.With that said, I'm done with this post, and I'm done with Code:Realize as well. I'm glad I got this out of my chest, and I can now move on to greener gaming pastures with a sigh of relief. I must admit that Code:Realize left me a trifle nauseated and not too eager to tackle other otome games right now. Although I would certainly have appreciated to maintain my current mellow gaming stride, I just can't bring myself to face more torturous love stories. So I'll let otome games rest for a while and find another relaxing game instead. See you soon with more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Code:Realize: Please get me out of here", "date": "27/11/2016", "text": "After my glowing experience with Sweet Fuse, I was still pretty low on energy and not quite ready to tackle a demanding RPG, which led me to elect another otome game as Sweet Fuse's follower. The happy winner was Code:Realize, an game that has been patiently waiting for its time since last year. Now that I'm done playing it, I think it could definitely have waited longer.I'll be blunt: I didn't like Code:Realize. It had its moments and it managed to captivate me to some extent; but overall, it was a pretty negative experience that left a bad taste in my mouth. And yet, as I mentioned above, I played it entirely—and intensively, since I polished off the whole thing in a couple of days without taking a break to write about it. So why was I so hell-bent on playing a game I didn't like, you may ask? Well, I guess it was out of curiosity—morbid curiosity, that is. I wanted to see how ludicrous the story would get and what absurdities it would throw at me; and last but not least, I wanted to see if the game would manage to wrap things up in a fulfilling and convincing way. For the record, the answer was no.As you probably guessed already, my main beef with the game and bone of contention with its reviewers is the story. It's widely said to be stellar, so much so that the game garnered the stellar score of 85 on Metacritic and was highly praised even by male reviewers; and yet that stellar story failed to enrapture me. This is the Steins;Gate situation all over again: a supposedly amazingly good story that started auspiciously yet ultimately left me cold and annoyed. If you want to know why, follow me through the next SPOILER-bristling paragraphs, dear fellow gamers.I'll start with a disclaimer: CR's story is not inherently bad, although it has its flaws. It's suspenseful, gripping and well told, with interesting and loveable characters and narrative arcs that converge towards a conclusion that ties all ends together. There are very few contradictions and plotholes, but that's not saying much given the nature of the story: it belongs to the fantastic genre and as such, it's much more likely to get away with plotholes through the shameless inclusion of ad hoc narrative elements. There are a couple of incoherencies, such as the fact that Cardia was virtually abandoned in the middle of nowhere instead of being securely kept at her father's side, or the fact that she could talk despite being an artificial being that had never been in contact with humans before escaping the mansion; but without these, the story would basically not exist. So let's just exercise suspension of disbelief and move forward.My main issue with CR's story is how sprawling and all over the place it is. See, I am a rather single-minded person that tends to favour slightly claustrophobic \"huis clos\" narratives, such as locked-room mysteries. I love when writers stick to a simple premise and skilfully work their way around it to weave a gripping and potentially mind-blowing story. And that, dear fellow gamers, is exactly what CR's writers did not do. They do offer an interesting premise, if only a bit cliché; but instead of sticking to it, they expand their narrative to the infinite and beyond, throwing tons of disparate elements that clash vigorously with each other into the mix. Vampires, British monarchy, philosophal stone, cloning, Knights of the Round Table, giant flying fortress: you name them, CR has them. Some developments come completely out of left field and seem to have been included for the sole purpose of avoiding plotholes, filling up narrative threads or giving a backstory to some of the characters—I'm looking at you, Saint-Germain's route.What I dislike even more than sprawling stories is derivative sprawling stories, and CR is a proud exemple of the genre. Not only are the characters lifted straight from literary works, but their backstories and the content of their personal narrative arc are more often than not also lifted from said literary works in the process. Such a heavy-duty borrowing of narrative elements verges on plagiarism—or at the very least on a very blatant and massive lack of inspiration. The blunt thruth is that despite its pizzazz and flashiness, CR is little more than a glorified cross-over fanfiction.Even worse, CR doesn't even have the grace to be a fulfilling cross-over fanfiction. As anybody who ever laid their eyes on this peculiar form of writing knows, the main purpose of fanfiction is to create romances that were never intended by the original material's creators—the smuttier, the better. Since romance is also the meat and potatoes of otome games, we should have a match made in heaven, right? Well, not quite so. Someone at Otomate apparently decided that it would be a great idea to make most of CR's romances entirely platonic. Yup, you read that right: not even a kiss to reward you for all your hard wooing work, let alone the promise of steamy physical intimacy between the newfound lovers after the credits roll. The harsh truth is that in three of the five routes, Cardia simply cannot touch her lover or be touched by them at all without the protective layers of her poison-resistant clothing. Really, game? Sure, this situation is justified by the narrative, but it sucks nonetheless. What's the point of having a love story in an bloody otome game if it doesn't allow for physical intimacy? That's cruel to the characters, and even crueler to the player that spent several hours of their precious time pursuing a bachelor, only to be rewarded by forced abstinence at the end. Shame on you, Otomate. I feel robbed, I really do.Mind you, there is worse to the routes than the inconclusiveness of their featured love stories. I've come to understand that otome games always have a so-called \"true route\" that is supposed to fully answer all the questions raised by the story and to put an end to  said story for good. Well, CR's writers went absolutely overboard with the true route: they made it the canon route by excellence, grossly neglecting the four other routes in the process. Said four other routes come across as mere side dishes, aborted versions of the main story that the player must plod through to gain access to the only real and authentic route that answers all questions. These routes shift the focus from Cardia's mysterious identity to whatever hurdles her bachelor of choice is facing, leave heaps of questions unanswered and don't even have the decency to offer conclusive love stories, which makes them feel entirely non-legit and out of place in the grand scheme of things. Games like Amnesia: Memories and Sweet Fuse had a true route all right, but all the non-true routes stood on their own and offered satisfying endings. Not so in CR, the game in which all non-true routes are mere roadblocks on the path to the one and only true and cannon route. And boy, does it suck.My, that was a lot of ranting, wasn't it? You get my point, dear fellow gamers: far from impressing me, CR's story ultimately left me frustrated and disappointed. It certainly doesn't help that it was so darn long: count three to four hours of play for the common route alone, plus two and a half to three hours of play for each route. That's nearly twenty hours of play, and these twenty hours left me drained and exhausted. Mind you, that won't prevent me from writing a route report very soon; I have more things to get out of my chest to settle the score between this game and me. I'll see you soon, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Sweet Fuse: Refreshing", "date": "22/11/2016", "text": "Gee, it's been a while since I last wrote, isn't it? I apologize for the long delay, dear fellow gamers. See, I was pondering which game to play after my last post when I was suddenly forced to take care of urgent matters that invited themselves into my life with the grace and subtlety of a cannonball. I had to use a lot of energy to solve these issues and I didn't lay a finger on any of my gaming devices during the last four weeks. Fortunately, the matter is nearly fully solved as I'm writing; and as the dust is settling and blood is drying on the now quiet battlefield, I can finally indulge in gaming again.I chose Sweet Fuse because I wanted an easygoing game that required as little player input as possible—I'm still quite low on energy, I must say. Sweet Fuse turned out to be a fun, entertaining little game that packed more punch than I had expected, and I enjoyed every minute of it. The story is gripping—albeit a bit too easy to figure out for my taste—and the romancing process is as simple as it gets: there is no flag system, and the game lets you kindly know when you've made the \"right\" choice, i.e. the choice that will make the coveted bachelor fall deeper in love with you. This is straighforward and unfussy, just as I like my video game romancing to be. On the other hand, the production values are the lowest of the low: apart from the rather appealing character designs and good voice acting, everything in Sweet Fuse screams \"budget\". I could probably count on my two hands the number of background pictures used throughout the game and the cutscenes look horrible most of the time. But that's a bit of a law of the genre, I guess; I still have to uncover a VN with stellar production values.I remember reading reviews deploring the fact that Sweet Fuse was too geared towards a young female audience for males to play it without cringing. I'm quite perplexed by such statements, which I'm tempted to blame on the fact that otome games were virtually unknown in the West when Sweet Fuse was released; because honestly, Sweet Fuse is not that soaked in girliness. Main heroine Saki is far from being a girl's girl, the overall tone is rather grisly and the game packs so little romantism that Amnesia: Memories' rough story feels like an Harlequin scenario compared to Sweet Fuse. Sure, there are a couple of kiss scenes here and there, and they can be cringing at times; but that's mostly because they are very poorly drawn. In a nutshell, don't let the otome nature of Sweet Fuse stop you, for you would miss a deeply entertaining and fast-paced story in the process.Now's the time to talk about the routes. Here's my own personal ranking, from my least favourite route to my utmost favourite one:Mitarashi: A rather unmemorable route as far as I'm concerned. In fact, I can't even remember what exactly happened. Mitarashi lacks depth and the whole \"yankee-turned-escort\" scenario was at once too far-fetched and too cliché to grab my attention.Urabe: This is the Toma situation all over again, i.e. a guy who's incredibly kind and polite yet hides some dark impulses behind the polished surface. Just like Toma, Urabe is prone to confine and imprison the object of his affection in the name of protection; and just like Toma, he comes across as more than a little unbalanced. This route was actually rather entertaining and would have been ranked higher if not for the fact that it's too short and that Urabe whines way too much for my taste.Shidou: My, what a disappointment. Shidou being a sexy b*tch with a cold-as-ice attitude, I expected a Defrosting Ice Queen scenario of massive magnitude rife with steamy moments—well, as steamy as a game geared towards teenage girls can allow, anyway. Alas, I was let down by Shidou's route. Not only does Shidou remains cold and boring until the end, but the route itself is far too long and poorly paced. As for the alchemy between Shidou and Saki, it's quite on the frosty side too. Heck, close to the absolute zero would be more accurate: during most of their cutscenes, he seems indifferent and bored and she seems ill at ease. Well, so much for the steaminess! Frankly, I expected more from the most popular character of the male cast and unofficial poster boy for the game.  Wakasa: A nice entertaining little route. It can best be described as mid-tier: good enough to be pleasant when you play it yet not good enough to be truly memorable. Although the idea of a blooming love story between an idol and a regular girl is too unlikely to really convince, it must be noted that Saki and Wakasa have a good chemistry—if only because they look so much like each other. Shirabe: A surprisingly good route. It's fast-paced and gripping, and there's a very good love chemistry between Shirabe and Saki despite their age difference. I only regret that the developers threw Shirabe's daughter into the mix; it feels slightly forced and it cheapens the overall narrative in general and this route in particular. Obviously, your mileage may vary on that one, and maybe many a player found Shirabe's daughter a cute addition to the game; but as far as I'm concerned, having a kid from a former union in the picture is a trifle gross. If I were a teenage girl, there's no way I would get romantically involved with a man who's already been spreading his genes around—especially if the result of said spreading is more than old enough to be my little sister.Mikami: Now we're reaching the top-tier routes and it's getting really, really good. Mikami's route is an intense, gripping and hectic route in which each wrong answer will result in an untimely death—exactly like Ukyo's route in Amnesia: Memories. Mikami actually shares something else with Ukyo, i.e. an unstable personality peppered with bouts of psychopathic behaviour. In other words, he's a bit of a nutcase, and that's why it's so enthralling to watch his story unfold. This route is the most \"romantic\" of the bunch, in the sense that it revolves nearly exclusively around saving Mikami from the dark side of the Force, shall we say. All in all, I deem Mikami more interesting than Ukyo in the role of the game's resident fruitcake: he's a charming nutter with a goofy side, a weirdly soothing voice and looks that make you want to take a trip to the nearest beach. Meoshi: Please welcome my favourite route! Not only was it enthralling and ideally paced, but the alchemy between Meoshi and Saki is quite amazing. The route is rife with sweet moments between the two of them and the slow blooming of their love story is just so totally believable that it made me all mushy and stupidly happy. Even better, Meoshi is the only character that undergoes some character development reaching beyond the scope of the narrative. We get to know quite a lot about his introverted personality and we see him come out of his shell and become bolder and more assertive as his route unfolds, which is a great development. This route resonated strongly with me, partly because I identify closely with Meoshi. There's the obvious \"gamer\" element, of course; but there's also the fact that I used to be painfully shy and introverted and prone to social anxiety in my early twenties. Heck, I was basically Meoshi in my early twenties; and just like him, I managed to overcome these hurdles. That's why his route had such an impact on me.  Jeez, I'm quite drained after writing for the first time in a month. Let's wrap this up, shall we? I don't have much to add anyway, apart from the fact that Sweet Fuse is a refreshing otome game that deserves to be played. Oh, and Count Hogstein is hilariously awesome—totally on par with abhorrent Monokuma from Danganronpa. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "World of Final Fantasy: Thanks, but no thanks", "date": "29/10/2016", "text": "And yet another Square Enix RPG that I won't buy. You know, I'm starting to think that the issue may be that I actually don't like Square Enix' current style. The only recent Square Enix games I truly adored were Dragon Quest IX and Bravely Default; everything else has been either a lukewarm experience or an instant hate affair. So maybe I'm simply going to write off Square Enix and stop purchasing their games altogether.Anyway, I'll keep this post mercifully short. I hated the little I've played of World of Final Fantasy and I certainly won't purchase it. To sum it up, the graphics are lacklustre and the game world is totally devoid of charm, battles are painfully slow and tedious, the camera moves make me nauseous and last but not least, it's a crappy Pokemon rip-off. Square Enix' pilfering of other successful gaming formulas is still going on full force, and it seems that this is indeed their new way of creating games.Well, I certainly won't support that. Square Enix may be a powerhouse and a gaming legend, but past glory can only carry you on for so long. I don't care how great a developer's resumé is; if their current games don't please me, then I won't invest in them. I did love both Square and Enix RPGs in the past; but in my humble opinion, what they produce nowadays is utter crap. Now I seriously dread playing my newly purchased copy of Dragon Quest VII and having to face yet another disappointment. But hey, what's bought is bought! At least, I avoided spending money on WoFF.Now I'm going to dig up a funny and light-hearted game to play next, because I really need to relax and unwind after my recent lukewarm gaming experiences. I'll see you soon with more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime! I just erased my CG2 save file and boy, am I relieved. I just can't play that game anymore.The last straw was yet another Wake-Up Call Boss that would have needed insane amounts of level-grinding, strategizing and patience to be overcome. I already grinded like crazy to beat Shadow Tsukasa and a couple of other wake-up call bosses before her, and I'm just sick of it. I managed to get used to the unbalanced field battles, but these cheated bosses are just ruining my fun.On top of being sick to death of unfair boss battles, I feel like I've seen enough of the game to quit now. All the girls have been rehabilitated and Knighted, so my job as a Program Instructor is done. I don't care that much about whatever final boss may come after that, nor do I care about the unavoidable harem ending and the post-game segment that will let me recruit Enri and fight yet another super-cheated boss. I'll just watch the ending(s) on Youtube and call it a day, thanks a lot.Still, there's no denying that I would still be playing if not for the game's horrendous fake difficulty and lack of balance. The girls' interactions are intense and gripping and they are all interesting characters despite being copy-pastes of CGIO's cast, and I would have liked to spend more time with them—all the more so as their Knight outfits are stunningly gorgeous. But hey, the gaming instinct wants what it wants, and it says that more grinding and cheated bosses are out of the question.And so I comply. I'm leaving CG2 to roam greener pastures, starting with the demo of World of Final Fantasy that I downloaded a couple of days ago. Let's see if Square's newest offering will be a gem or a turd! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Criminal Girls 2: Deja vu", "date": "26/10/2016", "text": "Let's not beat around the bush, dear fellow gamers: Criminal Girls 2, or CG2 for short, is a carbon copy of its predecessor Criminal Girls: Invite Only. Not only does it sports the exact same gameplay, but it also proudly features the exact same dungeons so far (albeit redrawn), the exact same \"motivation\" minigames (albeit slightly more sophisticated) and last but not least, the exact same cast of foes (without albeit: they were virtually lifted straight from CGIO). The only brand-new feature is the cast of characters, their backstories and the saucy scenes that go along with them—although then again, we're not exactly dealing with genuine novelties there. All the girls are blatantly inspired by their CGIO counterparts, be it in terms of looks, personality and demeanor: Chloe is a virtual copy-paste of Alice, Tsukasa of Ran, Yurine of Tomoe and so on. (It was actually quite entertaining to tie each CG2 girl with her respective CGIO inspiration.) Anyway, you get the picture: CG2 is basically CGIO with revamped art, a new yet familiar cast and ramped-up fan-service. Which in theory is totally fine by me, since I really don't mind treading on familiar ground when it comes to beloved gaming formulas. In practice, things are a bit more complicated. I'd like to claim that I fell head over heels for CG2 just like I did with CGIO and that I'm having tons and tons of fun playing it; but unfortunately, the reality is quite different. While I'm having a decent amount of fun with CG2, I'm far from being glued to it and I deem it quite inferior to its predecessor. This is due to a sole reason that jumped out at me as soon as I started my playthrough: CG2 is unreasonably hard. We're not talking about the \"challenging\" kind of hard there, but rather about the \"tedious\" type of hard—the one that generates eyerolls, exasperated sighs and ragequits. I was visibly not the only one being put off by CG2's excessive difficulty, since a so-called \"casual\" patch was made available for the Japanese version. This patch was added to the Western version, and I switched to Casual mode after a mere couple of minutes because playing on Normal mode was an absolute chore. Not that it changed my fortunes wildly, mind you: the only difference between Normal and Casual mode is that foes hit slightly less hard on the latter, but everything else is left untouched. Brace yourselves, this is how CG2 rolls when it comes to difficulty:—All foes have ridiculously high defense, coupled with a ridiculous amount of HP. They are also several steps ahead of the girls by default, with better skills that the girls often cannot prevent or counteract. As a result, all battles tend to be painfully slow and tedious. Even the meanest field enemy takes several turns to die and can inflict ugly status effects on the whole party long before the items or skills that can cure said status effects have been uncovered. As for the bosses, they are so cheated that it's not even funny. They are always lightyears ahead of the poor girls, with better stats, better skills and literally twenty times more HP. Beating bosses in CG2 requires all at once pre-battle grinding, strategizing, luck and a treasure trove of patience, and having all that doesn't even guarantee that you won't die after twenty-five minutes of arduous fighting. Battles in CGIO were stimulating and challenging affairs that flowed smoothly; battles in CG2, on the other end, feel like painful interruptions that take way too long to be resolved. In a nutshell, what we have here is a serious case of The computer is a cheating bastard. —The girls' suggestions in battle are often off the mark, especially when compared to CGIO. I've lost count of the number of times when all girls pull out their most powerful skills to dispose of a mere field enemy or coyly offer regular attacks when fighting a boss. They are also quite reluctant to suggest buffs and debuffs, which doesn't make boss battles any easier. This definitely qualifies as fake difficulty because of Artificial Stupidity.—The \"Motivation\" minigames have been made unnecessarily fussy and are now bristling with confusing instructions and complicated control schemes, which leads to fake difficulty because of Some Dexterity Required. Not only are they often tedious to play, but they don't allow for much clumsiness, unlike their CGIO counterparts. This means a higher failure rate, which means less XP gained, which means more grinding to gain CM points, which means more slow battles. Now that's the fake longevity cherry on top of the fake difficulty cake.You get the picture, dear fellow gamers: we have a big fat case of fake difficulty here, and it takes away a good chunk of the player's rightful enjoyment. Granted, I've already given praise to games that were choke-full with fake difficulty, such as Astonishia Story; so why am I so finicky all of a sudden, you may ask? Well, it's all a matter of expectations. While I fully expect a retro-ish game like AS to be unreasonably and unfairly difficult, I expect a fan-servicy game like CG2 to boast a light-hearted, easy-going and fun gameplay that complements its sassy overtone. I do NOT want to grind in a fan-servicy game, nor do I want to spend half an hour fighting a non-final boss. I don't know which point Nippon Ichi Software were trying to make by delivering such an unforgiving gameplay, but the outcome doesn't sit well with me. Now that I think of it, maybe they are actually taking the piss out of the player: you come here to indulge in SM fare with helpless girls and you end up being roughed up by the game—what goes around comes around, karma's a b*tch and all that, you know. That would sure be a brilliant display of irony, but that wouldn't make the fake difficulty easier to swallow. I've come very close to rage-quitting a couple of times, and I'm not sure I will be able to clear my current playthrough of CG2: I started playing it to get a break from Rainbow \"grindy\" Moon, and fake difficulty and drawn-out boss battles that requires metric tons of level-grinding to be overcome are not exactly what I signed for. Oh, well. The gaming instinct will decide, as always! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Rainbow Moon: On hold", "date": "23/10/2016", "text": "After 50 hours of play, I'm taking my first official break from Rainbow Moon. The break I took some time ago to try out Dragon Quest Builders was a mere intermission that hardly lasted a day; this time, I'm planning to stay away from the game much longer. Although I still love Rainbow Moon dearly, there's no denying that I'm starting to feel a teeny-weeny bit of grinding fatigue. I'd rather wisely take a break from the game now and come back to it later than soldier on and end up vomiting the whole thing. After such elating beginnings, such an outcome would be quite a pity and a shame indeed.This break is also partly fuelled by my trip abroad. Not only did that trip broke my grindy Rainbow Moon routine, making it kind of hard to hop back on the grinding treadmill once I came back home, but it gave me the opportunity to amass some absolutely glorious gaming loot. I found no less than five recent releases in a single shop—including three Vita games, of all things! And we're not talking about just any Vita games, dear fellow gamers: this trio of acquisitions includes Criminal Girls 2 and Valkyrie Drive, two games I never expected to find in shops in a million years. Well, not only were they here and ready for the looting, but they were also proudly advertised as the top-selling games of the moment. Looks like there's still some life in the Vita after all! At any rate, it's been years—if not decades—since I was able to purchase that many games in a brick and mortar store, and my elation is so intense that I literally want to play them all right now.The gaming instinct wants what it wants, and that's why Rainbow Moon must take a backseat while other contenders are taking center stage. I can already tell you that after much inner debate, Criminal Girls 2 is the game I elected to grace my Vita slot these next days. Time to indulge in another sort of grinding! That being said, I'm still very much planning to write about Rainbow Moon, and that promised list of the things I love in the game is still very much in the pipeline. See you soon for more gaming goodness, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Rainbow Moon: An exhaustive list of the things I don't like", "date": "12/10/2016", "text": "43 hours, level 40. My Baldren Solo Run—because yes, I'm now officially luxuriating in a Baldren Solo Run, without fear of jinxing the game by being too bold—is going stronger than ever and treating me to tons and tons of fun. I was afraid I had been too cocky a couple of hours ago, when I hit a difficulty spike of sorts upon entering Shadow Wall Mountains and found myself roughed up by local foes; fortunately, a bit of grinding and a couple of extra levels took care of that issue neatly and smoothly. Rainbow Moon is undoubtedly the type of game in which a few levels makes a huge difference—which makes total sense, since levels are so hard to gain to begin with. Anyway, after pimping up my little Baldren with overpowered gear, feeding him every single stat-increasing items I found and boosting his stats with Rainbow Pearls, I've reached a point where I'm virtually unstoppable and can single-handedly dispose of trash mobs as well as bosses without breaking a sweat. I also curbed my roaring obsession with the game to more manageable levels, and I don't feel anymore like my heart is being ripped out when I lay down my Vita.In a nutshell, everything is fine and dandy and I'm enjoying myself tremendously. I'm actually planning to write a massive list of all the things I like in Rainbow Moon; but first, I want to get the few things I don't like so much about the game out of the way so as to keep le meilleur pour la fin, as they say in France. Without further ado, here are the Rainbow Moon features that I would gladly do without:—No stackable items and no automatic item sortering in the inventory: items just pile up as they come, with no rhyme or reason whatsoever. There is an semi-automatic sortering option that even lets you choose the type of sortering you want—by name, type and so on—but it has to be activated manually from the inventory menu and reactivated every time you get some new stuff. Tedious doesn't even begin to describe how annoying this is, especially in a game so rich in loot.—Battles can't be sped up and battle animations can't be skipped at all. Being the grindy game par excellence, Rainbow Moon would really, really need both of these options. I fortunately got used to the long, drawn-out battles over time and even came to appreciate them to some extent; but that doesn't change the fact that Rainbow Moon forces the player to spend waaaaay too much time watching friends and foes do their thing and strut their stuff. I really hope SideQuest Studio will fix this issue in the upcoming Rainbow Skies and mercifully allow players to indulge in faster battles. —The hunger factor. To be fair, I don't really dislike it; a part of me even appreciate this throwback to classic rogueliking. But one must admit that apart from paying homage to a 35-years-old gaming subgenre, the hunger factor serves no purpose at all in Rainbow Moon—apart from needlessly cluttering your already tight inventory, that is. The whole hunger thing is designed to keep you on your toes in roguelikes, and it works beautifully; but it makes absolutely no sense to implement a hunger factor in a game where food can be purchased every ten meters and found in harvesting points on a regular basis.—Allies. Now, your mileage may vary on that one, but I found extra party members to be giant liabilities. The whole game is designed to accommodate a single character, from the size of the inventory to the Rainbow Pearls feature to the story itself (a man stranded in a foreign world trying to go back home, locked up in an endless pursuit of his nemesis), so why throw extra characters into the mix? They make battles a nightmarish slog, they are a chore to manage from the menu, they must be protected like fragile sprouts during their levelling-up process, they eat up your precious food and monetary resources and, last but not least, they ruin the glorious feeling of being a lone ranger in a unknown world. Sure, I do not doubt that they bring some variety to the gameplay if you can tolerate all these inconveniences; but there were other ways to achieve that goal. Give Baldren more skills, more weapons or even the possibility to change classes, but don't bother me with extra characters that requires tons of pampering. And if extra party members are required for safely navigating postgame territory like it's the case in some games, then let me recruit them in postgame—and properly levelled-up while you're at it. Don't just drag down my whole main game experience with those boulders when I can just as smoothly run solo.—The dungeons are all a bit samey. This didn't bother me so much in the early stages, when dungeons were few and far between; but now that they are getting larger and more abundant, I would like to see a bit more variety when it comes to dungeon design and decoration.I'm so far behind on my HP that it's not even funny.—Boosting up HP in the Attribute Shop requires a ludicrous number of Rainbow Pearls. We're talking about 15 Pearls for each extra point, and that's 10 or 12 too many given how much extra HP is available. Granted, this mountain of complimentary HP is by no means necessary to progress smoothly, but it's galling to be unable to get my greedy paws on it without an insane amount of Pearl farming. My theory is that this absurd situation is the result of a glitch or an oversight by the developers, who may have initially planned to implement less extra HP or to make each point cost less Pearls.That's the entirety of the things I don't like in Rainbow Moon so far; and as you can see, there are quite few of them and none of them are deal-breakers. Mark my words, my upcoming list of the things I like in Rainbow Moon is going to be much longer than that. It's going to have to wait a tad longer though, because I'm holydaying abroad for a couple of days starting tomorrow. I'll come back with a refreshed mind and (fingers crossed) some good gaming loot! Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Dragon Quest Builders Demo: Not my cup of tea", "date": "05/10/2016", "text": "There are some developers/publishers out there whose RPG offerings I can purchase blindly, knowing that I will always enjoy them. These luminaries of mine include Nihon Falcom, Sting, Compile Heart and a few others that never failed to satisfy me with their awesome RPGs. Powerhouse Square Enix, on the other hand, is not part of that list of gaming happiness purveyors. In my personal ranking, their RPGs range anywhere from cult classic (Dragon Quest IX) to abject failure (Adventures of Mana) and everything in between (Final Fantasy Explorers). There is basically no guarantee of satisfaction with Square Enix as far as I'm concerned; their RPGs can enthrall me just as readily as disappoint me. In an effort to preserve my bank account and spare myself some disappointment, I decided lately to do some thorough checking before purchasing any Square Enix RPG instead of blindly jumping on them like I used to do. I applied that brand-new treatment to Dragon Quest Builders, whose demo was released on the PSN lately, to figure out if that Dragon Quest spin-off was worth a spot in my precious collection.It turns out that the answer is no, which makes me glad I've given a try to that demo. DQB didn't click with me at all, leaving me bored stiff after a mere hour of play. Here are the main points that bothered me during that time:—The graphics are unappealing. While Minecraft's graphics have some sort of pixelated, low-fi charm, DQB's graphics just look like your average phone game graphics. It doesn't help that the colour palette is dull and washed-out. I expected to find some Dragon Quest graphical touch at work there, but the sad truth is that there is no visual reminder of the series apart from a couple of slimes fooling around and an avatar with distinctly Toriyama-esque features.—Too much camera fiddling. Any game that actually requires me to control and manually orient the camera is a no-go, so DQB is more or less doomed from the start.—The controls are messy and lack precision. Now, this may be due to the fact that I'm not familiar with building games à la Minecraft, but I found incredibly hard to position blocks properly—despite the outlines kindly provided by the game. A big part of this issue can be blamed on the fact that the analog stick doesn't allow for precise positioning; and while I'm sure that it's possible to get the hang of that positioning thing with practice, my first frustrating steps with it didn't exactly encourage me to persevere. To make matters worse, I don't like the menu interface at all and I find the commands really confusing.On a more fundamental level, it turns out that I'm not fond of the whole building thing. Building games invariably failed to enrapture me when I was a kid, and it seems that this lack of interest is still alive and well. While playing this DQB demo, I realised that the prospect of erecting huge structures didn't thrill me in the slightest; as a matter of fact, it sounded much more like a genuine chore to my ears. The conclusion is unplacable: Dragon Quest Builders is not a game for me, and thus it won't join my precious collection. That makes more room and money for another game, and that's great.On a more general note, playing that demo makes me wonder about Square Enix's policies of late. It seems that their main gaming formula these days consists in ripping off a successful gameplay style and slapping a heavy-duty layer of in-house fan service on top of it. Final Fantasy Explorers was basically Monster Hunter with a shiny Final Fantasy varnish, and DQB is Minecraft with a Dragon Quest sugar-coating. The upcoming FFVII remake seems to be borrowing heavily from the Telltale Games formula, and I just wonder: is this their new way of creating games? Are they just content with milking off their famous franchises while borrowing gameplay styles they didn't create and tweaking them ever-so-slightly? If they've really come down to this, that's a little bit sad—but hey, whatever floats their boat.At any rate, my thorough checking plan worked perfectly, and I firmly intend to apply the same treatment to the upcoming World of Final Fantasy. I've lost all excitement for that game after my recent string of disappointements with Square Enix RPGs, and it will have to prove really stellar to deserve a place in my precious collection and not share DQB's fate. And now, I'm diving back full force into my beloved Rainbow Moon. We were not apart for long, now were we? Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Rainbow Moon: Even more grinding heaven", "date": "03/10/2016", "text": "Although I've been playing for twenty hours now, it still feels like I'm in the early stages of the game, if not the very early stages. My little Baldren still boasts nothing more than a measly Lv.18, while I've caught a glimpse of Lv.800 (eight hundred) enemies in one of the dungeons I visited lately. (For the record, said Lv.800 foes were secluded behind a locked door, which was quite a relief. The mere sight of the number 800 hovering over their heads was enough to give me chills, I swear.) Not that this bothers me, mind you: I relish the slow pace of my Rainbow Moon saga and I firmly plan to enjoy every minute of that exquisite trip.It should surprise no one that I'm running solo, sticking to my little Baldren while letting other potential allies bite the dust to keep them conveniently out of my party. The flow of battles is ten times more comfortable and swifter with a single character, all the more so as recruited allies are usually underlevelled and must be carefully protected during the, oh, first dozens of battles they engage in after joining your crew. But really, the main reason why I don't want to deal with extra units are the Rainbow Pearls. My precious, awesome Rainbow Pearls, which I greedily want to keep for my little Baldren and not share with anyone else. See, Rainbow Pearls can be used to raise up stats beyond the average level increases, and such boosting is basically the key to stay ahead of the enemy mass at all times. Each foe drops one Pearl (two on Moon Days) and only the character that gives the final blow to a foe can harvest the resulting Pearl. Do you see the problem here? If I fight with other units, I will have to share Pearls with them, and stingy, greedy little me doesn't want to do that. At all. All must go to Baldren, period.And why wouldn't it go to my dear little Baldren? This guy is awesome and does a great job on the battlefield. He's conveniently standing halfway between the physical and magical types, his stats are perfectly balanced, his attack ranges are varied and useful, his special skills are wide-ranging and powerful and last but not least, he eats like a bird. Seriously, he can roam for days surviving on mere carrots, apples and water bottles. What an awesome metabolism, at least for the player that controls him! That's certainly better than ever-hungry Dozeru. (I could feel something was fishy with this guy when the quest to recruit him required me to purchase large amounts of nourishing food.) That being said, even though I'm planning to stick with Baldren to the bitter end, I am still fulfilling recruiting quests and stacking up allies, if only because these quests are entertaining. And who knows, I may stumble upon a roadblock later in the game and be in dire need of some extra units. Or I may unearth a totally awesome overpowered character that makes me forget about Baldren on the spot, although I'm not counting too much on that. My little Baldren is starting to show signs of over-levelling, and this condition is only bound to increase in intensity as I keep running solo. But as usual, let's play and see.Or let's not, actually, because I'm currently taking a small break from Rainbow Moon. This is not due to the fact that I'm growing tired or bored of it, but rather to the exact opposite. My obsession with this game is growing stronger by the hour, and it makes me do really strange things. Not only did I overcome the tiredness that used to grip me after one hour of play, but I'm now finding myself playing for three or four hours at a time, even when I merely intend to play for thirty minutes. The other day I was playing until 3 A.M., and I wanted to play more despite being exhausted! I also find myself wanting to get up and snatch a play session while I'm in bed and trying to fall asleep; the last time this happened to me was after purchasing my Megadrive in the mid-90s, and I'm not too sure I relish that throwback to my teenage years. Oh, and the game's music is looping in my head more or less all around the clock, obviously. This is all a bit overwhelming, and I feel a break is in order to digest all these feelings and reduce my obsession with Rainbow Moon to a more manageable level.In the meantime, I'm going to indulge in the free demo of Dragon Quest Builders, which I just dowloaded from the PSN. I'm very much on the fence regarding that game, having never played any building and crafting game à la Minecraft before; and this demo comes just at the right time to help me decide whether to purchase DQB or not. I'll see you later for a post about my impressions of that demo, dear fellow gamers, after which I'll dive back senselessly into Rainbow Moon. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Rainbow Moon: Grinding heaven", "date": "28/09/2016", "text": "I've been playing Rainbow Moon for six hours and I absolutely ADORE it. Consider 7th Dragon all but forgotten for now.The story of how my gamer's path crossed Rainbow Moon's one is quite a convoluted one. It is actually twofold, and here's how it goes:On one hand, I've been unsuccessfully looking for a certain type of RPG for quite some time now. Said RPG would have to be brutally grindy and to revolve solely around building up my characters' strength, preferably slowly and on the very long run. It would also have to sport a simple interface and unfussy gameplay while still boasting a modicum of depth. Gorgeous graphics and bright colours would obviously be much appreciated, if only to caress and soothe my retinas while I'm grinding like a beast. Grandblue Fantasy as described by Kina seemed to be a perfect match; but alas, it's a browser game, and a Japanese one to boot, and I rather wanted to play that super-grindy game alone with myself on one of my portable consoles. Some mobile games could have been adequate candidates, if not for the fact that they were always too simplistic, too ugly or required constant internet connexion to even be played, which is something I loathe. So I kept looking and pinning for that ideal grindy RPG, hoping to encounter it one day.On the other hand, I recently discover an amazing website: Limited Run Games, a.k.a. A Collector's Wet Dream. This North Carolina-based team of distributors had the most amazing idea of printing and releasing physical copies of digital games, in small batches to keep the hype up and the ball rolling. Cherry on the cake, I was lucky enough to discover them just as they were about to unleash a slew of RPGs. Or nearly so: as a matter of fact, I missed the release of Rainbow Moon by a mere couple of days (which could as well have been centuries, given how their games are usually sold out in a matter of minutes, if not seconds). Undeterred, I jumped on Ebay and unearthed a fairly priced copy of Rainbow Moon; but before pressing the Buy button, I wanted to make sure that this game was really worth a physical purchase. Fortunately, I had bought it on a PSN sale a couple of months before; so I dug up the memory card that contained it, booted my Vita and started a test playthrough.That's where the two parts of my story beautifully merge together. Not only did I love Rainbow Moon enough to warrant an immediate and frantic purchase, but that game also turned out to be the massively grindy RPG I had desperately been seeking for so long. If this is not serendipity at its most glorious, I don't know what is.One reason I would never have thought Rainbow Moon could fit the bill and be the grindy RPG of my dreams is the fact that it has been universally presented as a Tactical RPG or SRPG. That's a bit of misinformation here, if you ask me. Rainbow Moon is actually a very classic Turn-based RPG with an SRPG-flavoured battle system, similar to Astonishia Story or Popolocrois. This SRPG overtone is a double-edged sword: while it brings some welcome variety and complexity to all things fighting, it also drags the game down by making battles overly long and drawn-out. The combination of brutal grindiness and slow battles is a potent and deadly one indeed; and while I adore Rainbow Moon, I'm not shy to admit that playing this game exhausts me. I invariably end up drained after a mere hour of play, no matter how pumped up I am when I boot my Vita. And I'm usually very pumped up. Mind you, I wouldn't want to have Rainbow Moon any other way. The initial piece of gear sported by hero Baldren is called \"Daily Grind Armor\", and this name brilliantly sums up the ethos of Rainbow Moon. This is a very long game that requires patience and endurance, a game that's better played in small doses on the very long run. And heck, that's exactly how I intend to play it. Mind you, I am under no illusion that I will manage to finish Rainbow Moon in one go. Things will probably unfold that way: I'll play it a couple more hours until I get bored, then I'll play something else, then I'll come back to it until I'm bored again, and so on until I either finish it or drop it.But hey, let's not put the cart before the horse. Finishing or dropping Rainbow Moon is but a distant prospect for the time being, as I'm relishing every second spent playing and making my slow but determined way through the game world. There are still many places to discover, many levels to grind, many foes to slaughter and many hours of enjoyment to savour. I'm not done talking about Rainbow Moon and you're not done reading about it, dear fellow gamers. See you soon for more musings about that new crush of mine! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "7th Dragon III: Done and (nearly) dusted", "date": "26/09/2016", "text": "This time it's for real, people. I am standing proudly on VFD's still sizzling remains, covered in sweat, blood and grime, in the middle of a battlefied littered with dragons' corpses. Oh, the thrill!That cursed beast was not so hard to kill after all, and a bit of preparation went a long way into making it easier to slaughter. I buffed up all my units with special accessories, treated the cats at Meowdens to some Fancy Cat Food in order to fill up all Exhaust Gauges and then went back at it with a vengeance. I used all three teams to make the most of everybody's Exhaust Gauge, unleashing devastating EX Skills at the very beginning of each phase to get a good edge. I kept my usual Rune Knight/Agent/Fortuner team for the third and last phase, with the idea of taking advantage of the Hacking that can be generated by my Agent's EX Skill. Things when as planned, with VFD 3.0 being hacked right from the first turn. Hooray! It couldn't focus and attack after that, which allowed me to use Dragon Hatchlings on my Rune Knight and Agent and unleash a second wave of devastating EX Skills, combined with buffs obtained from Support Skills for good measure. Oh, the intensity! VFD 3.0 was hacked again and left with only a tiny portion of its HP bar, which I proceeded to empty with my most powerful regular attacks. The showdown was over after a couple of turns, without having required more Dragon Hatchlings or even a Unison attack. Now that's a neat and sleek boss fight if I ever fought one. Now that the dragon counter is empty at long last, let the credits roll!Roll they did; and before I knew it, I was standing at the entrance of the postgame dungeon. Said postgame dungeon turned out to be quite disappointing, if I have to be totally honest. Not only is it a boss rush that implies fighting stronger versions of every single boss fought in the game, but its takes place in a dungeon that recycles bits and pieces of all the dungeons visited throughout the game. Oh, and it boasts dragons as regular trash mobs, obviously. Now, do I want to explore the same dungeons again in order to kill bosses I've already killed? Heck, no!! If I wanted to do this, I'd replay the game itself, thank you very much. Give me an exclusive dungeon with exclusive foes, Sega!Oh, well. I can't say I'm crestfallen by this turn of events, because I've already had my fill of dragon-slaughtering and dungeon-crawling (or nearly so; but more on that in a bit). 7th Dragon III is an amazing game that I adored from beginning to end, and I'm immensely grateful to Sega for having localized it. With hindsight, I'm also glad that I own both the Japanese and North-American versions of the game, because it deserves all the support it can get. As a matter of fact, I'm planning to purchase the European edition as well as soon as it's released, to show the depth of my love for this game. And one extra purchase can certainly not hurt when it comes to supporting the series and paving the way for future western localizations of its entries, oh no precious.All in all, 7th Dragon III is pretty much a perfect game in my book. Great aesthetics, great music, great gameplay, great atmosphere, great game overall. The flaws I mentioned in my very first post were somehow taken care of: the excessive easiness disappeared and the railroading, while remaining present and stringent throughout the game, was so brilliantly executed that it was hardly noticeable, let alone painful. The pacing was brisk while maintaining breather moments at the right time and I was always eager to move on to the next step in line no matter what, so all this railroading really didn't hurt at all nor tainted my whole gameplay experience. One teeny-tiny flaw I would like to mention actually revealed itself at the very end of my playthrough: there is not enough dungeon-crawling in 7th Dragon III! This is not really noticeable during the game because of the high encounter rate and the many dragons hovering around, but dungeons are actually quite tiny and there are not so many of them. Now that all is said and done, I'm left with an unsated crawling hunger despite the 35 hours of play I poured into that game. I'm pretty sure that this is due to my insatiable appetite for all things Roaming&Crawling, though; most gamers will probably deem the amount of dungeon-crawling present in 7th Dragon III perfectly decent.Now that I polished off 7th Dragon III, discovering the series at long last in the process, I totally plan to play the original 7th Dragon as well as 7th Dragon 2020 and 2020-II. I own them all, which is a great starting point; and from what I've seen, they use the same templates as 7th Dragon III when it comes to interface and general gameplay, so I should be at home when playing them even if my Japanese is still lacking. The box of 7th Dragon is sitting on top of a console at home, taunting me and begging me to play it; I don't know when I will, but I'd wager that it will be quite soon. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "7th Dragon III: Curse you, VFD!!", "date": "23/09/2016", "text": "Remember when I promised in my last post that I would write again once I stood on the final boss' remains? Well, said final boss is still alive and breathing, to my utter irritation. Still, I didn't completely break my promise: although I'm not standing on its remains yet, I still killed it somehow. Twice, actually. So I'm perfectly entitled to write that post, all the more so as I have some burning and whirling feelings to get off my chest.That bastard VFD!! I had pondered the meaning of its initials before, settling on something like \"Very First Dragon\" or \"Very Final Dragon\"; but I'm now convinced that it means \"Vile F*cking Douchebag\". How dare that boss pull off a stunt that no boss in the game had pulled out before, namely to boast several forms? And how dare Sega play such a nasty trick on me, subverting my expectations for that final fight? That's so underhand, that really is.Mind you, that's my fault to some extent. I went into the fight mostly unprepared to test the waters, and was careless and silly enough to waste all my carefully saved Dragon Hatchlings during the first phase of the showdown—which I thought would be the only phase then, in my defense. That first phase was easy enough, but I was in for a nasty blow when witnessing the appearance of the boss' second form. I switched teams and soldiered on, finally managing to snatch a resounding victory after a most glorious Unison attack. Oh, the joy! I was ready to execute a victory dance, but then came the cursed third form! I totally crumbled on the spot, I swear I did. Then I picked up my shattered bits from the ground, put up a brave front and kept fighting, although I was starting to feel seriously wretched at that point. Things had gone on nicely and smoothly enough until then, despite the blows to my morale inflicted by the boss' unexpected rises from the dead; but this last phase was bound to change the story. VFD 3.0 managed to wipe out my whole team with one powerful attack, forcing me to make another attempt at eating away its mammoth HP bar. The game was fortunately merciful enough to let me restart at the beginning of the third phase rather than force me to undertake the full showdown again, which I'm immensely grateful for. Alas, this was not enough to change destiny: beginner's luck was decidedly not with me back then and winning that fight on the first attempt was not meant to be. I could have won, mind you. After two subsequent tries, I was starting to figure out VFD's patterns as well as tricks to work my way around them; and I'm pretty sure that I could have taken that pest down with a few more tries, despite my initial lack of preparation. The reason why I was forced to surrender was a mundane yet unescapable one: I had to set out for work, dear fellow gamers. Time to work hard after playing hard! Now obviously, I could have put the 3DS in sleep mode and resumed the fight once I was done playing slave to the wage; however, I wanted to get a better start and snatch a clean victory from VFD's jaws. Just you brace yourself, you filthy protean abomination! I'm coming back with a revamped team, maxed-up skills, better equipment and strategies up the wazoo. Oh, and a good amount of free time with no obligations looming on the horizon, obviously.With that, dear fellow gamers, I'll see you again once my dragon counter is down to zero—for real this time.

{"title": "7th Dragon III: The end is near", "date": "22/09/2016", "text": "After 30 hours of play, I'm finally down to the last dungeon. I have 40 dragons left to eradicate, which happen to be all conveniently located in said last dungeon; and since I'm done polishing off all the sidequests available in the game, it's going to be one clean and neat final push from now on. That's just how I like last dungeons to be, so that's perfect.Since my last post about sidequests, I discovered another feature I had neglected to explore until then, namely the romancing. Which has actually little to do with romance and everything to do with having your way with every single major NPC, from big boss Allie to grizzled officer Yoritomo. You can literally get into everybody's pants, regardless of their gender—or yours, for that matter—and regardless of how many other NPCs you've been intimate with before. Isn't that the perfect promiscuity simulator? Add to this the fact that the ultimate carnal knowledge resulting from dating NPCs is very unsubtly signaled by sentences that range from embarrassing to hilarious (I still laugh inside when thinking of Yoritomo offering me dessert before uttering \"I did say that I would answer any request, but this... Go easy on my old bones...\") and you get a feature that I would have royally ignored if not for the awesome benefits that can be reaped from acting as Nodens' resident sex fiend. Said benefits are nothing less than exclusive powerful weapons for all classes, which can be obtained from every NPC after you get to know them in the biblical sense of the word—which happens after three dates, en passant. Granted, these powerful weapons are bound to become outdated as soon as the 6th item expansion becomes available at the beginning of chapter 7; however, they can make the two ultimate fights of chapter 6 much easier and smoother, so they're totally worth sweating for—in every sense of the word.You've probably noticed by now that I ditched the blue-eyed samurai girl featured on the game's cover and her human sidequicks in favour of a more feline team of Atlantean characters. Things will probably stay that way until the end, because I love both the looks and alchemy of this new trio. For the record, that's a Rune Knight, an Agent and a Fortuner we have here, and they rock together. On the other hand, I didn't click with the last two classes, the Banisher and the Mage. The Banisher is a lot of hassle to handle because of the bomb thing, and the Mage is little more than a copy of the Duelist. I doubt I will ever use my two Banishers and my Mage on the battlefield; their buddy skills, however, can be quite useful, so I'm still keeping them in the back teams.I don't have much to add, really. I'm currently gathering my energy before the last stretch, which will certainly be a slaughtering frenzy. 40 dragons in a single dungeon, people! My Atlantean three currently boast a hefty lv. 65, and I'm confident they can climb up to Lv. 70, if not more, by the time they reach the final boss. With that said, dear fellow gamers, I'm on my march towards destiny. I won't see you again before standing on the final boss' remains, I promise! Until that fateful moment, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "7th Dragon III: Sidequests with (LOTS of) benefits", "date": "20/09/2016", "text": "I just emerged from a slew of sidequests that acted as a welcome breather from all the dungeon-crawling and dragon-killing. Mind you, this turn of events is rather unexpected: in the early stages of the game, I had decided to virtually ignore the sidequests after having tackled a couple of them and realised that they were rather boring in execution. They consist exclusively in running back and forth between people and places to look for this and that item, with sometimes a battle or two thrown in the mix. Add the fact that these quests are just as much on rails as the rest of the game, with pointers conveniently indicating where the people and items involved in the quest of the day can be found, and you'll understand why I decided to steer clear of them. However, the game had other plans in mind and basically forced me to clear a couple of them in intermission chapters. I was not exactly reeling with happiness at first, but I changed my mind when I saw for myself the many benefits of these sidequests. Since then, I've been tackling more and more of them with an ever-increasing delight. These sidequests may be on the boring side of running errands, but see for yourself the awesome benefits they bring:—The rewards for polishing off these sidequests are always plentiful and tremendously useful: cold hard cash, field skills, rare pieces of gear and items that are not sold at the local shop, skill points, you name them. For instance, one of the quests yielded an awesome skill that can totally suppress random encounters, while another gave me access to a no less awesome skill that can multiply by 1.3 the amount of XP reaped from the next fight. On the spot before fighting dragons, as you may expect. —These sidequests also provide interesting insights into the storyline, sometimes even at the meta-level of the series itself. Thanks to a trio of quests, I could infer that the original 7th Dragon on the DS is actually a sequel to 7th Dragon III, while 7th Dragon 2020 and 2020-II on the PSP are prequels to it. It's also fun and refreshing to see the characters interact with each other in a light-hearted and often humorous way during the quests, and it certainly helps flesh out my crew as well as NPCs.—Last but not least, some of the dragons are solely accessible through sidequests. This is definitely the main draw for me, as I plegded myself to slaughter 'em all in the early stages of the game. A good way to know if more dragons can be found in an area after the dragon counter for this area is down to zero is to check for the presence of Dragonsbane flowers in the area in question. If the Dragonsbane is still blooming there, then some dragons are very likely still lurking around. Go clear these sidequests to get them! Not only is it a thrill to unearth hidden dragons, but scouring areas from the Dragonsbane as a result is deeply satisfying. Now that's a job well done!After having pledged myself to kill all dragons, I've now pledged myself to clear all sidequests, regardless of how mundane and on-rail they may be. There is always a neat benefit to be reaped from them, and they act as a pleasant breather from the frienzied and grindy dungeon-crawling and dragon-slaughtering to boot. Now if you'll excuse me, dear fellow gamers, a guy wants me to deliver a love letter on his behalf. A dragon hunter's work is never done, indeed! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "7th Dragon III: Perfect curves", "date": "18/09/2016", "text": "I'm not referring to the characters' perfect body lines and postures there—although mind you, these terms could perfectly apply to them. They are getting more awesome by the sprite and I really wish I could have selected some of the latest models at the beginning of my playthrough. But I digress.I'm here to talk about other curves, starting with the awesome difficulty curve, which is the most perfect one I've seen this side of Link's Awakening. I mentioned the easiness of 7th Dragon III in my last post in a slightly disparaging tone; but after 18 hours of play, I have no complaints anymore in that department. I went from a smooth place where I was able to take down dragons in two turns, was swimming in money à la Uncle Scrooge and basically owned the dungeons to a much rockier place where I have to grind for money to purchase equipment, face double dragon battles on a regular basis and have to play hard even in field battles if I don't want to end up in a bind. Oh, and cherry on the nastiness cake: the Dragonsbane flowers, which used to be pleasantly innocuous in the early stages of the game, are now hurting me—in a vicious nod to the original DS entry. And you know what? I absolutely adore this evolution. The most awesome thing is that I didn't even realise that the game was getting harder by the dungeon, because the difficulty curve is so smooth and flawless that there is virtually no difficulty spike. I just suddenly pondered things after disposing of a particularly tricky boss and thought: \"Wait a minute, where is the easy game I was playing a couple of hours ago? What I'm playing now is a grind fest, and a hard one at that! Hooray!\" I'm so totally lapping this up, and I hope the game has more challenges up its sleeve before the end. Which I'm sure it has.Never a truer sentence was spoken.Another curve 7th Dragon III draws just right is its learning curve, especially regarding party matters. I started with three party members, a limited amount of skills and battles that demanded no further implication from me than spamming the attack command every turn; 18 hours later, I'm managing nine party members wielding skills by the truckload and I have to carefully strategise each move in battle if I want to escape unscathed. And once again, getting from the former to the latter didn't hurt a bit thanks to the learning curve being so brilliantly executed. You would have thought that a serial solo runner like me would absolutely hate being stuck with so many units to manage, but I'm actually relishing it, to my utter surprise. The game did a great job in introducing new party members very slowly and letting me get properly used to them, while skillfully drawing my attention to all the benefits brought by these extra units rather than to the micromanagement hassle they could generate. As a matter of fact, they really don't generate that much micromanagement hassle, rather bringing a welcome variety to the gameplay. When I was getting bored of my first trio of dragon hunters, I switched to the second one and nearly felt like I was playing a different game. Right now, the game is requiring me to roam the dungeon du jour with one team at a time, which is a neat challenge. (Cherry on the convenience cake, I didn't even need to grind to level up my new recrues; while they are waiting to take the stage, they stay safely tucked away in the back row while XP is raining on them.) In a nutshell, the learning curve is so utterly perfect that it's nearly frightening. I'm now climbing these flawless curves with an eagerness that's only growing by the dungeon, and I hope they still have many delights in store for me before I'm done with eradicating the last dragon of the game. By the way, I didn't miss a single one of them so far! I'm now down to 139 and counting—the halfway mark is in sight, hooray! The current dungeon alone still hosts 37 of them, so I'll have scoured a good chunk of that pest when I finally make a triumphant return to the Nodens headquarters, all drenched in sweat, blood and grime. With that said, I'm getting back to it! See you soon for more dragon-slaughtering epics, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "7th Dragon III: A long-awaited foray", "date": "14/09/2016", "text": "Ever since I read Kina's inspiring posts about 7th Dragon, I've been longing to play the series. Alas, my meagre notions in Japanese didn't allow me to dive senselessly into the first two—or three depending on how you consider them—instalments, released on the DS and the PSP. (Not that I didn't try, mind you; but the kanjis were barely readable on the DS screen and the text scrolled way too fast to allow a beginner like me to decipher it. Oh, well.) I though I would have to wait a few more years and make substantial progress in Japanese to be able to discover the series, until Sega took the gaming world by surprise by announcing something no one expected: they would localize 7th Dragon III both in North-America and Europe, and grace us with physical releases of the game to boot. Oh, the joy!Since Sega announced the North-American localization long before the European one, I pre-ordered the former and was treated to a lovely 'Launch Day Edition' that packed a small art book compiling all the character models and bites of concept art. Given that the game's art is all-around gorgeous, this is certainly a nice treat, made all the nicer by the fact that I didn't expect it at all. Thanks a lot, Sega!This gorgeous art book inspired me so much that I decided not to shelve the game, sticking it instead right away in my 3DS and starting a playthrough. I chose the blue-eyed girl featured prominently on the game's cover as my main character, because in my mind, she's somehow the hero of the game. She's not, of course: 7th Dragon III is one of these games that let you choose your party members' character model, completed with palette swaps and voices options so that you can craft the ultimate moe team of your dreams. Anyway, upon having selected the solemn and aloof beauty featured on the cover, I was pondering a solo run for a little while; but that plan was quickly ditched when I discovered that the game kindly allots the exact same number of XP to all party members, regardless of their numbers. Running solo would have meant that I would have literally needed to grind thrice as much than with a regular party, which I was totally not in the mood to do. Especially not when there are so many cute character models and interesting classes available.So far, I absolutely love 7th Dragon III. Interestingly, it reminds me somewhat of Ecco the Dolphin, of all games. I reason that this uncanny association is due to the splendid crystalline colours, the 70s prog-rock infused soundtrack (layers upon layers of synth, what a ear candy!) and, last but not least, the Sega logo that graces my eyes every time I boot the game. (Oh, sweet nostalgia.) I've played roughly 9 hours, and from what I've seen, 7th Dragon III is shaping up to be a rather long game. Which is totally fine by me if it keeps being that wholesome—and awesome.If I had to express a minor gripe, that would probably be the fact that the game is a trifle too easy, even in the normal difficulty mode. I didn't especially go out of my way to grind, and yet my team is so powerful that they can take down minor dragons in two turns without suffering a shred of damage. I expected these dragons to be more of a handful and to have more bite, so to speak, so I'm a bit disappointed; however, that minor point doesn't tarnish my love for the game in the slightest.Another minor gripe is the fact that 7th Dragon III is extremely linear and pretty much a game on rails. My team is at the beck and call of the shady organisation they enrolled into, jumping when their bosses say jump and exploring that dungeon when they say explore that dungeon. Explore might be too strong a word, mind you: given that dungeons are as linear as they get, there is very little actual exploration to be performed there. Heck, even random encounters are streamlined. See that bar on the up-left corner of the picture on the right? That's a random encounter meter of sorts. As your team runs around, it goes from blue to red and triggers a random encounter when it's fully red. This means that random encounters always happen with the same frequency, which is a bit boring when you think of it. All in all, the only space of freedom granted by the game regards the decision to kill or spare the many optional dragons littering the dungeons, which is left to the player's discretion. You probably know me enough to guess that I decided right away to exterminate every single one of the 250-or-so dragons that roam the game world. Grinding is me life!With that said, I'll take my leave, dear fellows gamers. These pesky dragons won't slaughter themselves, now will they? See you soon for more juicy bites of 7th Dragon III! And as always, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Gaming plans", "date": "12/09/2016", "text": "Here's a quick update regarding my overall gaming plans for the months to come. There will be no such things as a list of games I'm planning to play though, but rather general guidelines; and they'll actually be more about peripheral things than about gaming per se. Oh, well. Let's get started!First, the collecting thing. After five years of super-intensive collecting, I'm burnt out not so much on collecting in itself, but rather on ordering games from the internet, waiting for them and paying those wretched custom fees before being allowed to lay my hands on my precious acquisitions. I'm thus declaring that I will from now on stop ordering games from the internet and rather perform bulk purchases anytime I'm holydaying abroad, which happens often enough to guarantee that I will not miss out on any coveted games. Well, I may have to keep ordering from the internet occasionally, for instance if I want to get my paws on Japanese games; but I will try to keep these instances to a minimum. Less custom fees, more collecting happiness!When it comes to backup systems, I'm pretty much done purchasing every console that caught my eyes; and as a matter of fact, I now have enough systems to keep gaming for decades—providing that these precious stand the test of time, which remains to be seen. Anyway, my ultimate planned purchase in that department is none other than the gorgeous Pearl White New 3DS XL that is going to be released in November this year. See, I recently reassessed that particular model as I started playing 7th Dragon III on my American New 3DS XL, which I had not used prior to that. As I did so, I discovered that this beast was unexpectedly comfortable to play and strained my thumbs and wrists considerably less that its smaller counterpart, the regular New 3DS. Cherry on the cake, the screen is nearly as wide as a Vita screen and deliciously crisp and sharp. In a nutshell, the New 3DS XL is now my favourite iteration of the whole 3DS lineup, and I absolutely need the European version of that thing of beauty, ergonomy and performance. If I'm in a collecting mood, I may even end up purchasing the pink and orange versions on top of the white.Let's now move on to the blog matter. I'm very much planning to continue writing about games; but after three years spent on the free side of blogging, I now want my own website, with domain name and hosting fees included. My ethos is pretty much to grind and sweat to get my paws on good things—as my love for grindy RPGs abundantly proves—and I know for a fact that maintaining my own website with my own money is going to prove ten times more satisfying than mooching off Blogger. I'm studying the different hosting options for the time being, although it's quite likely that I will go for the famous and ubiquitous Wordpress. Any advice regarding that matter is most welcome, dear fellow bloggers!Last but not least is gaming per se. I don't have much of a plan in that department, except to follow my gaming instinct wherever it may lead me, which is as glorious a plan as it gets. Oh, and I will definitely stop trying to play more than one game at once. I'm probably the worst multi-tasker on this hemisphere, and I never get as much pleasure out of a game as when I concentrate solely on said game. Even two games at a time is too much of a hassle for me, so I'll wisely stop trying to be the multi-task wizard I am not and I will, well, play it my way.With that, my gaming plans for the months to come are laid out. See you soon for my first impressions on 7th Dragon III, dear fellow gamers! And as always, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "On to the next game!", "date": "06/09/2016", "text": "Yes, I'm back! After more than a month of complete rest, I laid my fingers again on a gaming device at long last. And boy, did it feel amazing.It certainly doesn't hurt that I reclaimed a lot of my passion for gaming and collecting during that month spent away from gaming devices. Both had become a bit of a part-time job these last months, and I had come to tackling them in a semi-automatic way without even realising it. It didn't help that my collection had been standing in boxes ever since I moved to a new place one year ago and that I had resorted to throwing new gaming acquisitions in boxes and pantries without bothering to sort them. But I finally endurtook that long-overdue endeavour and reorganised my whole beloved collection, generating plenty of pleasant feelings in the process. Sentences such as \"oh, I remember I got a super bargain on that game!\" or \"jeez, this game was so hard to find!\" or \"gee, I didn't even remember I owned this game!\" popped up in my head on a regular basis, along with an overwhelming sense of pride and happiness. I worked really hard on my beloved collection and I'm deeply content that I did.But most importantly, I recovered the feelings of elation and giddy innocence that used to be mine when I started collecting. I see games again like I did back then, i.e. as promises of many hours of delight and thrill. When I look at my collection now, I don't think anymore about the games I still have to purchase to \"complete\" it, but rather about the countless hours of enjoyment packed by all the games I already own. It's an amazing feeling that I had lost along the way, and I'm intensely glad it came back to me.All in all, I'm quite grateful for this forced break away from gaming. I'm coming back refreshed and rejuvenated and more than ready to roll again. Oh, and of course, my wrist is now fully healed! I obviously have to take it easy and go slowly to avoid ending up in the same predicament again, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem. See you soon for more juicy gaming bites, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Gaming break—extended", "date": "02/08/2016", "text": "August is here, and as promised, I'm back in business full force. This is what I should write; but unfortunately, the reality is quite different. See, the wrist pain I mentioned in my last post has evolved into a full-blown case of tendinitis—and a nasty one at that. The verdict is unplacable: I have to stay away from all gaming devices until things get better, which could take several weeks. And since unnecessary typing is also off-limits, there won't be a lot of blogging either during that time—not that I would have written a lot anyway without playthroughs to write about, mind you.I'm quite bummed by this turn of events, but let's face it: health comes first. I wouldn't risk ruining my wrist beyond repair just for the sake of gaming, so I'll be sensible and leave my consoles untouched for as long as necessary. With that said, I'll see you later, dear fellow gamers. I'll be back here eventually, be it in three weeks or three months. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Summer gaming break!", "date": "14/07/2016", "text": "As the title abundantly implies, this is a brief message to let you know that I'm taking a summer gaming break of sorts, dear fellow gamers. I've being playing games quite consistently these last months; as a result, not only are my thumbs and wrists experiencing some serious strain, but I'm starting to feel a teeny-weeny bit of gaming fatigue. On top of that, this is summer, and my whole being craves the outdoors. I've thus decided to indulge in a retreat away from gaming and blogging until the end of July, after which I'll go back into business full force. I'll see you in August with fresh posts, dear fellow gamers! Until then, enjoy your summer! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!King Garon is no more, and thus I'm back for my final post about the Hoshido side of Fates.The final showdown was not as excruciatingly hard as I had feared, but that's not saying much given the forgiving difficulty parameters I chose at the beginning of my playthrough. I tremble at the though of tackling an old-school entry of FE and having to deal with permadeath and its harsh consequences—and I'm thinking first and foremost about fake longevity there. I wouldn't have minded tackling a given battle ten times in a row in order to let all my units escape unscathed when I was a teenager starved with games, but I certainly would mind now that I have a backlog the size of the Everest to polish off. Oh, well; no need to worry about future FE playthroughs now, I guess. I'll see how it works out when I play these intimidating older entries; and in the meantime, let's move back to the subject at hand, namely the end of my run.  I'll be honest: although I'm quite delighted with my Birthright playthrough and proud of the feats I managed to accomplish as a complete beginner, I'm harbouring sour feelings towards Fates right now. The reason is pretty simple: as I witnessed the purposefully vague and unconclusive ending that unfolded at the end of my 16-hours run, I realised that Fates was not the game I had imagined. Before purchasing it, I assumed Fates was a trilogy of standalone games à la Pokemon, only with a wider range of narrative variations; however, Birthright forced me to confront the awful truth—Pokemon this is not, indeed. Far from being the triumvirate of SRPG masterpieces I pictured in my eager mind, Fates is one big pie of a single game that was arbitrarily divided into three portions—each portion being then sold for the price of the full pie. Birthright is not solid and meaty enough to stand as a game in its own right, and it takes but a playthrough to realise it. Not only were there still heaps of unanswered questions when the credits rolled, from the true nature and purpose of Azura to the reason why Garon changed so much lately, but I was also left unsated and craving for more. This was not due to the shortness of my run per se—I've played plenty of 15-hours playthroughs that left me deeply satiated—but rather to the fact that Birthright is a truncated game that cannot offer a fully satisfying gaming experience.Now, to cut a standalone game in three and sell it as three distinct games—with the matching price tags, obviously—is definitely a rip-off and a swindle in my book. I have a hard time believing that Nintendo pulled off such a dirty sham, and yet the facts are there: I forked out $120 to get the full Fire Emblem Fates experience, courtesy of Ninty and their money-mongering schemes. After the region-locking, the shortage of games and the gimmickry, this was definitely the last straw for me, and I thus officially declare that I will stop supporting Nintendo at the end of the 3DS' tenure. Granted, they are the company that single-handedly got me into gaming twice, and that should count for something; but although I'm obviously forever grateful for the major part they played in my gaming career, I never let the past cloud my assessment of the present—and my assessment of Nintendo's current policies is scathing. I don't like their decisions and haven't done so for quite some time, and that shameless Fates scam is the last indignity I will suffer at their hands. There will thus be no more Nintendo handhelds for me, even if this implies renouncing future Pokemon entries. I don't think I'll be missing that much anyway, given that they seem to have become unable to develop their own IPs on their own machines in what can be considered a decent amount of time.Rants and pledges asides, I won't pick up Conquest or Revelations right away. I spent 33 hours toiling through Birthright, only to be left feeling unsated and cheated when the credits rolled; I thus need some time away from Fates to nurse my wounds and rekindle my desire to play that game. But fear not, dear fellow gamers: I'm definitely planning to polish off the whole package, all the more so as the gameplay itself was quite satisfactory. Let's thus meet later to savour the rest of the Fates pie, shall we? Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Atelier Rorona Plus: My (great) work here is done", "date": "12/07/2016", "text": "After 14 hours of alchemic deeds, I'm done with Atelier Rorona Plus. Although I managed to clear all assignments with three-star rankings—bar the last one, which reaped only two stars—the fact that I totally neglected to build up my popularity during my playthrough meant that I could only pretend to the Normal Ending and its rather uneventful outcome. I have to admit that for the time being, I really can't fathom how I could have cranked up my popularity to the sky-high levels required for the better endings. I mean, I hardly had enough time to fulfill the assignments, let alone run errands for the townspeople! I guess this is manageable with more experience, and I'm pretty sure seasoned Atelier players can get all the endings with their hands tied behind their backs. What I'm also pretty sure of is that I won't ever become one of them.At some point in the game, Rorona's mercurial master Astrid asks her if she loves alchemy, and I couldn't help but take that question personally. Do I love alchemy? Well, not quite. I obviously like it to some extent, given that I cleared the whole game without having to force myself too much; but my feelings for virtual alchemy are pitifully tepid when compared to my burning love for all things grinding, roaming and crawling. To put it simply, there are at least half a dozen RPG subgenres that I love more than alchemic RPGs à la Atelier. I certainly didn't expect that; as I mentioned in my last post about Rorona, I expected to adore the series and enjoy it deeply. Alas, a blast this was not. Although I finally managed to relax and get used to the gameplay, I was never really enthralled by the game. I plodded through the whole thing, doing only what was strictly necessary to progress and never feeling compelled to accomplish more. Not that I could really have, anyway; I don't have the knack for multi-tasking, neither in real-life nor in videogames—and the game didn't really accommodate me with its somewhat unclear interface and messy gameplay. (For instance, the fact that recipes sometimes require a specific trait rather than a specific ingredient was too complicated for my taste; I would have preferred to deal solely with clear-cut base ingredients.)All in all, my biggest issue with Rorona's gameplay lies in the degree of freedom alloted by the game, which I would describe as too large to be reassuring yet too narrow to be exhilarating. Rorona offers neither the compelling and fulfilling freedom of dungeon-crawlers—a favourite gaming subgenre of mine—nor the stimulating and challenging constriction of puzzle and adventure games—another favourite subgenre of mine. The former allow a seemingly limitless number of ways to play while the latter tolerate only a single one; they are standing at opposite ends of the freedom spectrum and are riveting because of their extreme nature. Rorona, on the other end, lounges somewhere in the middle of the spectrum—with the lack of intensity to match. This is a game that requires the player to do their best in a given time and with a limited amount of resources; in practice, this means that there is neither a single suitable way nor thousands of them to play your way out of an assignment, but rather a general course of action allowing a limited number of variations. Deviate too much from that stringent course of action and you'll get a Game Over as a punishment for your wayward ways. The same kind of limited freedom can be found in Fates, and I'm starting to think that this is actually the essence of strategy as a gaming genre. \"Do your best with what you're given, and try again if you're not happy with the result\" could be the motto of such strategy-flavoured games. While I'm adamant that I can never come to love these games as much as I adore dungeon crawlers and puzzle/adventure games, I'm pretty sure that I can learn to genuinely like and enjoy them on the long run.When all is said and done, I'm definitely not swearing off Atelier games. Although my playthrough of Rorona was not the most enrapturing run of my gaming life, it was still pleasant enough to make me want to play the other Atelier games I own. I will just play them my way, accepting my limitations and focusing on what I feel capable of accomplishing without fretting over what I'm missing out. On the other hand, I don't think I will invest in any more Atelier games from now on, and I highly doubt I will ever replay Rorona in particular. My only hope now is that the other Atelier games I own will somehow prove more interesting and gripping than Rorona. Hope springs eternal in the heart of the gamer who wants to recoup their investment, indeed! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Fates: The end is nigh", "date": "10/07/2016", "text": "As the conclusion to the Hoshido arc is drawing near, it's time to write a last progress report before wrapping up the whole thing. The final showdown is going to be bloody and messy, that much is sure: not only are story-related battles getting harder by the chapter, but I stopped clearing Challenges a couple of chapter ago in order to get in shape for the Nohr arc. The last three engagements, i.e. from chapter 23 to 25, were ruthless battles that I managed to win only by the skin of my teeth, with just a couple of characters still standing at the end. I was literally down to my last unit during the chapter 25 confrontation, with only Ryoma alive to slay the boss; you can easily imagine the relief that washed over me when this survivor hanging onto half of his HP bar landed a death blow on said boss. While I find the fact that Ryoma is so much more powerful than other units a bit overindulgent and ridiculous overall, his amazing capabilities certainly come in handy in such circumstances. Ryoma \"I save the day\" aside, my final dream team comprises Corrin (obviously), Kaze, Scarlet, Kagero, Reina, Hinata, Oboro, Subaki, Hana, Azama, Takumi and Shura, as well as Caeldori and Hisame, who are respectively Subaki's daughter and Hinata's son. I generously used Master Seals on all units that could benefit from it, which led to most interesting class changes. Hana is now a Priestess and can wield both the bow and the staff; likewise, Azama has gained the ability to fling around the naginata when becoming a Great Master. Subaki and daughter Caeldori are now Falcon Knights and can also wield low-tier healing staves, which makes a grand total of four polyvalent units that can work both on the offensive and healing front. Most of my other units have become offensive powerhouses through the class change process: Hisame and Hinata are now Swordmasters, Kaze and Kagero are Master Ninjas, Oboro is a Basara and Takumi a Sniper, and all can wreak havoc on the battlefied. My force is overall well-balanced and doing a decent job on the battlefield, if not a stellar one; but I attribute my often lacklustre fighting performances to my lack of experience in the SRPG field. The only notable issue that cropped up lately is the weakness of my four flying units, who have been regularly and thoroughly overwhelmed in the last confrontations. They were doing a great job in the first twenty chapters with their ability to cover large expanses of terrain and scour isolated opponents out of the battlefield, but they are clearly reaching their limits in the last chapters. With hindsight, I wish I had ditched two or three of them earlier and focused on other potentially interesting offensive units; but what's done is done, and I have to make do with the force I created with my own hands.For my fellow gamers interested in the romantic side of Fire Emblem, here are the pairings I managed to craft throughout my playthrough: Kaze/Corrin (obviously), Caeldori/Hisame, Takumi/ Kagero, Subaki/Hana and Hinata/Oboro. I also paired Orochi with Saizo and Silas with Azura in the early stages of my playthrough—before mercilessly ousting the four of them from my force as I focused on other units. As you can see, I played it safe and mostly went along the game's not-so-subtle pairing suggestions. Poor Ryoma didn't find a mate yet, nor did Azama and Shura; as for Reina and Scarlet, they are still single as well—courtesy of the game itself, which doesn't allow them to marry for some reason. All in all, I think we're pretty much set romantically, as I won't integrate any new units just for the sake of marrying my remaining trio of bachelors.I'm now more eager than ever for wrap up my playthrough. Bring it on, game! My force is all prepped up and my body is ready! This is the final push, dear fellow gamers; I'll see you when I'm done beating Garon to a pulp and dancing over his remains. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Atelier Rorona Plus: Cramping my style", "date": "06/07/2016", "text": "This had to happen: I finally made my first foray into the long-running Atelier series as well as into the vast world of so-called \"alchemic RPGs\".I was initially planning to play Atelier Escha&Logy Plus, but I reasoned that it would be better to start with what can be considered the roots of the series on the Vita, i.e. the Arland trilogy. More specifically with the first game in the trilogy, namely Atelier Rorona Plus. And thus I found myself embroiled in Rorona's epic fight to keep her master's atelier afloat and discovering the marvels of videogame alchemy for the first time ever. And boy, does it defy and crush my expectations regarding virtual alchemy in general and Atelier games in particular.Indeed, I used to have my own private vision of how both virtual alchemy and Atelier games should play like. Said vision was informed by my love for all things grinding and by my playthrough of Hometown Story, which is the closest thing to a simulation game I'd played before picking up Rorona. I envisioned games that would let me forage for hours on end and synthesize items by the truckload, in what could only be described as an alchemic-flavoured take on good ol' grinding. As for the time limit, while I vaguely knew of its existence, I fully expected it to be lenient and to allow for a lot of foraging, synthetizing and running around trying various things.The actual gameplay of Rorona is, of course, a million miles away from this rosy picture, and I can see from here the knowing smiles on the faces of the players who are familiar with the franchise. Never before did I play a game in which every single decision matters so much and must be so carefully pondered. Not only is the time limit so stringent that there is very little room for error and/or experimentation, but the resource management is absolutely diabolical. Nothing is given for free in that game and nothing must be taken for granted: every single action costs resources, time and/or money, and balancing everything that must be accomplished is a full-blown challenge. In fact, not only is it a challenge, but it's actually the whole point of the game. The alchemy is but a pretense here: at its core, Rorona is really just a game revolving around time management, whose sole purpose is to accomplish as much as possible in a given amount of time.Despite the fact that I've performed honourably so far, clearing the first two assignments with a three-star evaluation and all ratings to the max, I have to admit that playing Rorona makes me feel quite fidgety and cramped. This is not the most relaxing of games, especially for a total beginner. Not only do I tend to fret about the best course of action, but the risk of failing an assignment and seeing a couple of gameplay hours go down the drain looms large over my playthrough. Of course, there is no indication that this is ever going to happen; if anything, my first steps into the game are rather indicative of the opposite. Now, only time will tell if I keep up with the good work and manage to do a clear round or if I stumble along the way. At any rate, I hope I will manage to relax a trifle and handle my alchemic duties with more gusto and abandon on the long run. Let's play and see!So far, while I'm having a decent amount of fun playing Rorona and can certainly feel a rewarding sense of accomplishment when I manage to monitor tasks and assigments in a clever way, I didn't have a massive crush on the \"alchemy simulation\" subgenre. As a matter of fact, I was expecting to love the genre considerably more, and the relative tepidity of my feelings for Rorona definitely took me by surprise. On the other hand, this means that I can dispense with purchasing Japanese physical editions of all the Vita Atelier games for the sake of perennity; given my moderate love for the genre, my physical edition of Atelier Escha&Logy will certainly suffice to satiate all my cravings for virtual alchemy in the decades to come. Good thing I restrained myself and didn't purchase Japanese physical versions of Atelier games before playing Rorona. Patience is definitely paying off! Now if you'll excuse me, my third assignment is waiting to be tackled. See you later for more alchemic deeds! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Fates: A fresh start", "date": "30/06/2016", "text": "From my experience, chaos theory applies quite adequately to videogames. Minor uninspired decisions made at the beginning of a playthrough can pretty much expand into massive hurdles as said playthrough unfolds, totally ruining the whole experience in their wake. However, tinkering with the offending parameters can work miracles and make way for a much more pleasant playthrough. I've been copiously using that trick to great effect, from Dragon Quest IX to Animal Crossing, and I decided to let it work its magic once again on Fates.I came to realise in the last hours that despite my best efforts, my run couldn't be salvaged. I had made too many bad decisions, taken too many wrong turns and wasted too much time on endeavours that turned out to be unproductive, ruining my whole playthrough beyond repair in the process. I needed to wipe the slate clean and start anew, and that's exactly what I did by erasing my save and restarting the game from the so-called \"branch of fates\" where paths diverge, choosing Hoshido once again.My first change was to opt for a female Corrin instead of a male one. My reasoning was that the moe-ladden behaviour of my male units would be easier to swallow if it were directed towards a female character, because it would then pass as chivalry or galantry rather than boy's love innuendos. I was also secretly hoping than the bonding scenes would be toned-down for male mates and that I would escape embarrassing kissing simulations. To my utter delight, my assumptions and estimates proved quite accurate, and that fresh new start with \"Lady Corrin\", as she's respectfully called by my force, totally feels like the right decision. There is also something more intangible at work there: for some unfathomable reason, I do feel that the whole story works better with a female Corrin. Granted, this may be a personal impression only; but on the other hand, I never experienced this kind of feeling with Pokemon or Avalon Code, whose stories flow just as naturally with characters of both sexes. I'd be curious to know if other players feel the same—because sometimes, stories do indeed work better with a character of a given sex for a myriad of intangible reasons—or if this is really just an idiosyncrasy of mine.Then there was the Kaze issue, which needed to be resolved at all costs. Kaze was my absolute favourite unit by a very long shot—heck, I liked him considerably more than my Corrin—and to lose him was quite a blow to my morale. I knew I had to save him during that second playthrough; and since this can be achieved through gaining A support rank with Corrin (kudos to Elisa for letting me know about this), I figured that I could as well go all the way and pair my stoic, aloof, noble-looking female Corrin with equally stoic, aloof and noble-looking Kaze. As I'm a total sucker for stoic, aloof, noble-looking characters, this was absolutely a match made in heaven; and it certainly helps that the support conversations between these two were both intense and full of restraint and thus quite fascinating to watch. This riveting dynamic is maintained during the bonding sessions, which are a glorious mix of reserve, formality, frankness and forwardness on Kaze's part. If the Corrin/Azura bonding sessions were often reminiscent of dates between teenage lovers, Corrin and Kaze's brand of bonding is much more genuinely akin to intimacy between adult spouses, which suits my tastes better. At any rate, that matter is now solved, and I can relax and indulge in the joy of fighting with my favourite unit throughout the whole game without fearing that he'll be removed from my force. Life is sweet!Matchmaking aside, my main goal with that second playthrough is to keep things tight and streamlined in order to preserve the game's pacing and to avoid ending quagmired in boredom like the first time around. This implies focusing solely on a limited number of units and ditching the rest without mercy; and this is actually a much-needed relief, given how much of a hassle it had proven to maintain an evenly leveled-up force during my first playthrough. As a consequence, I will spare myself the trouble of clearing the Paralogues—except if I have a really, really massive crush on the involved kid. None of the units recruited during these Paralogues were stellar anyway, and some of them were giant walking liabilities. (I'm looking at you, Mozu. Oh, the hours I wasted leveling-you up to no avail, because you were always so bloody weak.) And while I'm at it, I will also skip Invasions, which means that I can avoid wasting my food on Lilith and use it to power up my units instead thanks to the Mess Hall. Two birds with one stone! This time around, I will also play matchmaker more actively and let love bloom between units, for the sake of increased performances on the battlefield—and also a little bit for the sake of entertainment: I've gotten used to the feature and I have to admit that it's both cute and amusing to see units growing closer and finally tying the knot. I've been following these new guidelines for a couple of chapters now and I'm having quite a blast. Battles are much more interesting and thrilling now that there are less of them and that my crew is tighter and not overleveled anymore, and I love catering to my favourite units and molding them into ultimate soldiers. This revamped run of Fates/Birthright is the absolute treat and proves yet again that every game deserves a second chance. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a fiery battle/matchmaking session to attend. More news of my exciting brand-new run soon! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Fates: Now we're toiling", "date": "27/06/2016", "text": "17 hours into Fates, and ennui is slowly but surely creeping in.I'd like to keep my initial warm feelings for Fates intact, but the game is not exactly accommodating me. The story is just as nonsensical and asinine as in the early stages, if not more; at that point, I've been force-fed a couple of \"plot twists\" that could be foreseen from miles and only served to increase my foul disposition towards that mediocre mess of a storyline. The whole narrative is so simplistic and predictable that I'm seriously starting to believe that it was written with 14-years-old players in mind. To make matters worse, I fought so many free battles that I actually forgot what my force was supposed to achieve in the first place. We're now marching towards Nohr, but I don't have the slightest idea of why, which is deeply embarrassing. I feel like a kid who's been drifting out during class and is anxiously waiting for the teacher to find out—except that there is no teacher, and the only punishment I face is to be at a loss regarding the goals of my force until the end of the game. I can live with that, especially since I didn't care that much about the story in the first place.Then there is the moe overdose, which is getting worse by the chapter. I'm now married to Azura and I have to endure some moe antics of the worst sort, such as needing to blow in the mic to refresh her face, to wake her up with the stylus and, last but *shudder* not least, witnessing her mimicking a kiss to me—and I mean the real-life me, not Corrin. Although I knew this kind of thing existed in romance games, I had never been confronted to it myself and I found the whole scene deeply cringing. As though lovestruck Azura were not enough, my whole force is behaving like giggling schoolgirls and begging me to give them accessories. Accessories! Erm, do you people realise we're supposed to be at war? And don't even get me started on the bath house, because I could become vulgar. I swear a piece of my soul died when I saw that this optional building was nothing more than a way to squeeze your obligatory piece of bath fan-service into what's supposed to be a serious and mature game. But maybe FEF is not supposed to be mature and serious after all, but rather yet another fan-servicy game pandering to teenagers with inferiority complexes: that would certainly explain why every damn unit in this army is so smitten with Corrin, asking him for gifts and visiting him all day long to tell him how great he is with coy blushes. The huge number of characters to manage at that point in the game is also unfortunately spoiling my pleasure. I cannot keep track of them all, let alone use them all in battle and keep them all properly leveled-up; and to my dismay, I have to ditch a good number of them on the side of the road as I march on. I also noticed a modicum of planned obsolescence, with older units being considerably weaker and less efficient than newly recruited ones. Maybe these are FE staples, for all I know: maybe I'm supposed to toss overpowered units without mercy as I progress, and maybe I'm supposed to cherry-pick my favourite characters like I would choose dishes from a buffet. If this is the case, I won't bother keeping everyone evenly leveled-up during my next FE playthrough, thank you very much. Oh, and maybe that will allow me to actually see romance blossom between my units; because so far, love has not exactly been in the air. Apart from Azura and Corrin, my only other couple are Setsuna and Hayato, and no one else is making much progress towards marriage. I have to admit that I have other fish to fry on the battlefield than pairing units according to matchmaking plans, so I decided to leave the whole marriage matter to chance; however, since I've been switching so much between units, relationships are not exactly blooming. Kaze and Rinkah ended up married a couple of battles ago, only to be separated as (SPOILERS) Kaze fell to his doom saving Corrin. (I wouldn't be surprised if he turned out to be still alive and the resident traitor to boot, though.) (END OF SPOILERS) This kind of event doesn't quite encourage me to put some work into raising my units' support ranks, let me tell you that. Also, I wonder what was the point of all the fuss about homosexual relationships being possible in Fates; because as far as I've seen, it's not the case at all. A bit of research seemed to indicate that the gigantic number of two characters were potentially bisexual; that, in my book, amounts to an Easter Egg and certainly didn't deserve any mention, let alone a full-blown announcement by Nintendo. I could list plenty of other minor gripes, such as the fact that ever-hungry Lilith is virtually useless since there are nearly no invasions, the fact that the gameplay of the headquarters sessions is too reminiscent of a browser game for my taste, or the fact that the support conversations are totally uninspired and certainly don't feel like the first steps of a solid friendship, let alone an intense love; but let's admit it, that would be boring and disheartening. I think I took a bit of a wrong turn when starting the game: by playing too many free battles, spending too much time toiling in the base camp and wanting to lavish an equal amount of TLC on each unit, I diluted the intensity of the whole experience and drove myself into a slog. But I'll steer my quagmired playthrough back on track by focusing more on story battles and on my favourite characters from now on, and hopefully the second half of the game will be more thrilling than this uneventful first half.

{"title": "Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2-Sisters Generation: All's well that ends well", "date": "25/06/2016", "text": "After 30 hours of non-stop grinding, I'm finally done with Re;Birth 2. I'm sated and elated and I enjoyed that playthrough from beginning to end. I wanted a heavy-duty bout of grinding and that's exactly what I got—trust HN games to scratch vigorously any grinding itch a gamer may have. I also wanted a gaming experience similar to my playthrough of Re;Birth 1; and in that regard, I got much more than I bargained for, because Re;Birth 2 is virtually a clone of Re;Birth 1. Apart from a couple of extra characters and dungeons, this is basically the exact same game with the exact same gameplay, the exact same cast of characters and the exact same overall feeling. It's certainly a treat if you enjoy the series as much as I do, but it comes across as a complete rip-off if you're anything less than a die-hard HN aficionado.  The last stages of my playthrough were a tad anticlimatic, if I have to be totally honest. I level-ground so dutifully throughout the whole game that my party was actually a trifle over-levelled by the time I reached the final boss. Polishing off that ultimate showdown was a mere formality and a matter of a couple of turns, with no major casualties except from Falcom fainting once. For the record, my winning party was made of Nepgear at Lv. 53, Compa at Lv. 51, Cave at Lv. 49 and Falcom at Lv. 47, and I'm immensely glad the game didn't force down my throat a final boss so hard that only a full team of CPUs could have beaten it. And talking about CPUs, I was a bit bummed that the CPU quartet from Re;Birth 1 joined my party in the late stages of the game. Not only did it make my force a bit too crowded for my taste, but it stole the resident CPUs' thunder in a way that was not to my liking. Neptune, Noir, Blanc and Vert were the undisputed heroes and main attractions of Re;Birth 1; couldn't Nepgear, Uni, Rom and Ram have been granted the same honour in Re;Birth 2? At any rate, there was no way I would let the big sister brigade steal the show in my own playthrough, and thus I dutifully stuck with Nepgear, Compa, Cave and Falcom until the very end. These fab four did a stellar job in boss fights, with Nepgear and Cave as the main damage dealers, Compa as the skilled healer and Falcom as the EXE drive gauge refiller/minor damage dealer. I didn't feel like using Uni, Rom and Ram on the long run because their attack ranges, which favoured a healthy distance from foes, made for a tricky positioning that was more a chore than a joy. Sorry, girls—but fret not: I adore the real-life, physical versions of you.I incidentally learnt that Re;Birth 2 offers as many as six different endings, some of them boasting insanely arcane requirements. I find the whole thing a little bit pointless, to be honest, because the storyline is clearly not Re;Birth 2's strongest suit. I unearthed the so-called Normal Ending, which is deemed the easiest of the bunch, and I'm perfectly happy with that outcome. There's no way I'm going to replay the game and try to uncover the five other endings all by myself, be it with an FAQ in hand; I'm playing HN games solely for the grinding, and I'll get plenty of it no matter which ending I get. Not to mention that trying to tinker with each nation's shares in order to reach the desired requirements for the hardest endings feels like a complete micromanaging nightmare, and I loathe micromanagement in games. All in all, this was a gloriously fun playthrough of a game that managed to feel both pleasantly familiar and refreshingly new. It was certainly not innovative by any means when compared to Re;Birth 1; but that's not what I was looking for in the first place, so this is perfectly fine by me. As a matter of fact, I was so eager to bask again in the glorious feelings elicited by my first encounter with the series that I initially planned to replay Re;Birth 1 itself; however, I'm glad I changed my mind and picked up Re;Birth 2 instead, because it treated me to the exact same delightful experience while still bringing something new to the table. Now I can only hope that Re;Birth 3 will follow suit—although there is little doubt it will, given how hell-bent on recycling the HN series is. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2-Sisters Generation: Grinding reigns supreme", "date": "21/06/2016", "text": "Let's get straight to the point: I absolutely adore the Hyperdimension Neptunia series. If I had to establish a top ten of my favourite Vita games, the first two HN instalments would undoubtedly be part of it; and if I had to pick up my three favourite Vita series, HN would absolutely be one of them. This may come as a surprise, given that I hardly ever mentioned the series on this blog and never reviewed any Hyperdimension entry. What happened is that I played HN Re;Birth 1 last summer, right before holidaying abroad; as a result, the planned review of that game was lost forever as holiday laziness and newer playthroughs pushed it out of the scene before it could even make an entrance. However, I absolutely adored that game and have the fondest memories of that playthrough; and one year later, I decided to treat myself again to a healthy dose of HN goodness by playing HN Re;Birth 2.To my utter delight, I was reunited with all the HN staples I had come to know and love over the course of my HN Re;Birth 1: the adorable zesty characters, the witty story poking fun at the videogame industry, the pint-sized dungeons that are really more akin to grinding patches than genuine dungeons, the hardcore boss battles every two steps, the side quests by the truckload, the exhilarating special attacks and their over-the-top animations and, last but not least, the metric tons of grinding. HN is nothing if not a series that strives on grinding and wears its grindy quality like a badge of honour. Dungeons may be pint-sized, colourful and bristling with hilarious-looking foes, but each one of them is a difficulty spike per se that requires a healthy amount of grinding to be navigated safely. And let's not even talk about the boss battles, which are ruthless engagements that can prove challenging even with a conveniently levelled up party—and utterly impossible to win with an underlevelled party. HN reprises the old-school trope of the Boss that's unbeatable unless you boast a Certain Level, and I fell pray to it during my playthrough of Re;Birth 1: due to a lack of regular level-grinding on my part, I totally failed to beat the final boss. Said final boss had a regenerating ability, and the combined attacks of my underlevelled party were not dealing enough damage to counter its automatic healing. (The amount of grinding that would have been needed to overcome that hurdle of a final boss would have been staggering, so I wisely—or cowardly—decided to give up.) I was determined not to end up in the same kind of bind again during my playthrough of Re;Birth 2, and I started grinding dutifully and regularly from the get-go. That was a most inspired decision, because Re;Birth 2 is harder than Re;Birth 1, if that's even possible. So far, my playthrough can be divided as such: 85% grinding, 10% boss battles and 5% story-related cutscenes and inventory management. You've been warned, fellow gamers.Of course, I absolutely lap up this heavy grinding, and this is due to a sole reason that is none other than the fighting system. To put it simply, HN's fighting system is my favourite RPG fighting system ever, all subgenres combined. It clicked with me like no other fighting system ever did, because it combines everything I love from the three main RPG fighting systems. It sports all at once the exhilarating button-mashing of real-time fighting, the relaxing deliberation of turn-based combat and the fine-tuned positioning of strategic/tactical fighting—all sprinkled with sharp, glorious animations that make even the meanest fight a feast for the eyes. I'll spare you a boring technical explanation of how the whole thing plays out; any video will do a much better job at this than me. This fighting system is the ultimate RPG fighting system hybrid, and it's so sleek and utterly brilliant that I wonder why no developper ever thought of mixing these elements together before HN. Maybe is was not technically possible, or maybe it was too cutting-edge for most audiences; and given how little praise is lavished upon HN's fighting system and how mixed are the reviews of these games, I suspect that the latter might be the truth.Although I adore it, I have to admit that HN is pretty much a hit-or-miss series. If you love grinding and click with the fighting system, then you're in for a treat; if not, then you can forget about the series altogether, before there is really nothing more than grinding to be found there. Exploration is totally absent because of the tiny dungeons and the fact that the next objective in line is always highlighted; and the story, although excellent, is too minor to justify playing the game solely for it. Seeing cute personifications of the Game Gear, the PSP and the DS as well as luminaries such as Compile Heart, Idea Factory and Nihon Falcom in RE;Birth 2 is certainly a delight—and I enjoyed it all the more as a portable gamer at heart, obviously—just like discovering all the clever puns about the gaming industry hidden in the game; however, it certainly won't help a player allergic to grinding to stomach the vast amount of it present in the HN series. Grinding is the meat and potatoes of HN, and all the rest is but accompaniments. I'm currently 25 hours into Re;Birth 2, and I can feel that the end is drawing near. My current party comprises Nepgear, Compa, Cave and newly recruited Falcom and I'm pretty satisfied with that line-up—heck, Cave's Black Label supermove alone can terminate boss fights in a couple of turns. I'm starting to suspect that I may need a party made solely of CPUs to beat the final boss; but that shouldn't be too much of an issue thanks to the awesome inclusive levelling-up system, which gives experience even to the characters who are not in the party. At any rate, I'm planning to undertake a massive level-grinding marathon before the final boss, because said final boss will surely turn out to be an Everest-sized difficulty spike. See you in a few hours of grinding, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Fates: Rocky beginnings", "date": "19/06/2016", "text": "A couple of hours into FEF, and I'm hooked for good—confirming in the process that I can indeed enjoy SRPGs just as much as any other RPG subgenre. I'm deeply relieved, all the more so as I own a considerable number of SRPGs that I yet have to play. One may call me air-headed for having bought so many games without even knowing if I could enjoy the genre they belong to in the first place, but you know how I am—collection is me passion! But I digress. Let's go back to my young FEF run, which happens to take place on the Hoshido side—i.e. Birthright—and to follow the lenient setting combination of Casual mode and Normal difficulty. Hey, I am an SRPG and Fire Emblem beginner, after all.I may be totally captivated by FEF right now, but that love didn't bloom immediately. Far from enthralling me, the very early stages of the game left me cold, annoyed and ultimately deeply unsatisfied. I was bothered by a multitude of details that spoilt my pleasure, and here are those joykillers in their unholy glory:—Much to my dismay, the story comes across as quite asinine. The overall premise is both silly and ludicrous, and main character Corrin accepts the cataclysmic change in his life and takes his new situation in stride a bit too fast and willingly for my taste. Shouldn't he feel at least a bit conflicted about the whole thing? Shouldn't he have legitimate doubts about the truth of the matter? And what's with the cliché of the oppressive kingdom ruled by a crazy tyrant living in an cold stone castle devoid of furniture vs. the oppressed kingdom that favours diversity and is ruled by a kind royal family all decked up in silk? I honestly expected more from a series that's always been hailed as deeper and more mature than most of its peers. Alas, the narrative content I've seen so far is really no different from your average J-RPG story—there's even a reference to Corrin's supposed amnesia, for crying it out loud!—and as a result, FEF's narrative left me thoroughly unimpressed. —The amount of moe injected in the game really disturbs me. I've always envisioned Fire Emblem as a venerable, serious and austere SRPG series that relied more on gameplay quality than on flashy looks; and somehow, the presence of moe doesn't quite square with that solemn picture. I wanted a mature-looking Corrin, yet the character creation interface is so soaked with kawaisa that I really struggled to create a character that didn't look like a 15-years-old cosplayer in full convention mode. (And I still feel like I failed for the most part.) As for the \"private\" conversations taking place in Corrin's abode, they are absolutely cringeworthy. To see your teammates utter lame and cheesy sentences with a coy, please-be-gentle expression is deeply embarrassing, and I'm immensely grateful that Nintendo removed the Petting minigame for the Western release, because I don't think I could have stomached it. These people are my fellow soldiers, damnit, not cute and fluffy pokemons begging to be stroked! —The battle animations are painfully long and so frequent that they totally disrupt the flow of the gameplay. Never before in any game have I been confronted to battle animations so shamelessly intrusive; I'm pretty sure that if I were to count the amount of time devoted respectively to gameplay and to battle animations in any given battle, the latter would win by many a minute. Combine these ubiquitous battle animations with the omnipresent story-related cutscenes and you're left with the feeling of playing an interactive movie that requires player input solely to trigger cutscenes. —The menus are ridiculously confusing and sorely lack ergonomy. Actions as simple as changing a character's equipment or browsing the available selection in shops are much more complicated than they should be, and the amount of character data displayed on the lower screen is so abundant that it nearly comes across as a parody. What's the \"rating\" of a character supposed to refer to, for instance? Heck, this is the one game that would absolutely require an detailed, paper-based instruction manual to refer to at all times. All these hurdles made the game such an absolute pain to play that I seriously considered giving up after a couple of battles. Fortunately, my messy young run was salvaged by the discovery of the Options menu and the fantastic possibilities it harboured. I cranked up the game speed to Fast and totally shut off the combat animations, and a totally different game appeared before my grateful eyes: a brisk, fast-paced, no-frills game with deliciously retro low-fi looks. Then I discovered the possibility of grinding senselessly through subsidiary battles, and there was no turning back. (I unfortunately couldn't alleviate the moe-soaked conversations and the complicated menus, but I'm getting used to the latter and looking elsewhere during the former.) I've been playing for roughly seven hours now and I'm loving FEF more by the hour. I'm pleasantly surprised by how portable-friendly the game is: it's incredibly easy to play it in short bursts thanks to the Battle Save feature, which makes it the perfect game for commuting. Of course, it also accommodates long playing sessions just as well, and my own sessions often stretch far beyond their planned boundaries—as a matter of fact, I was so engrossed by the game once that I nearly arrived late at work. I can sense a glorious playthrough ahead, and FEF will probably end up being my main Summer 2016 game. It's not as light-hearted as my usual summer picks, granted; but after the massive Pokemon rampage of these last weeks, a change of tone is most welcome. To a Fire Emblem summer! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's delight: Crystalline beauties", "date": "15/06/2016", "text": "Despite the fact that the DS Lite was the most popular, emblematic and recognizable model in the DS line-up, I was never too fond of it. I always thought the DSi was the superior console, be it in terms of size screen and resolution, ergonomy and looks; and as a result, I concentrated solely on DSi models and never bothered to hunt for DS Lites. That is, until now.What made me change my mind and consider DS Lites as valuable backup systems is the existence of an awesome feature that was (unfortunately) removed from the DSi. You guessed it, fellow gamers: I'm obviously talking about the GBA cartridge slot. Since I've been accumulating a pretty decent collection of GBA games in the last years, this feature now greatly interests me. The prospect of playing GBA games on a bright and colourful DS Lite screen rather than on a crappy GBA screen is an appetizing one indeed, and that's what prompted me to start hunting for DS Lites. My plan was to purchase two brand-new consoles and then to play GBA games exclusively on them, using my collection of second-hand GBAs solely to play Gameboy and Gameboy Colour games.I was lucky enough to unearth an online seller that offered two brand-new DS Lites for very fair prices, and in gorgeous crystalline colours to boot. These two colours are simply my favourite of the whole DS Lite line-up and I could definitely have elected them even if all colours had been available. These two DS Lites are splendid and look like appetizing pieces of hard candy, and here they are in all their crystalline glory:I'm quite delighted and proud to have managed to snatch these two beauties, and they will get a place of honour in my collection of backup systems. I've work really hard these last two years to put together said collection of backup systems, and I feel now that my work is nearly done. I may purchase a Pokemon Sun or Moon New 3DS bundle this fall, and that will be the end of my backup accumulation crusade. My console hoarding work is done!

{"title": "Pokemon X: The female Meowstic solo run", "date": "14/06/2016", "text": "Yet another Pokemon solo run for your delight, Poke aficionados! Jeez, the Pokemon fever that struck me of late has been of unseen intensity—not that it bothers me, mind you: I actually lap up these irrepressible gaming frenzies. That being said, this particular run shouldn't have existed at all. I was initially planning to tackle a solo run of Omega Ruby and pondering my choice of 'Mon for said run when I happened to watch a video about gender dismorphism in Pokemons. (Jeez, those weird topics on Youtube.) The first 'Mon introduced in this video was Meowstic, and... I'm sure you can easily guess what happened next. Heck, I had an instant crush on that 'Mon—that's what happened. I immediately started gathering data about these lovely cats; and upon learning that the pair roamed the Kalos grasses only, I ditched my planned run of Omega Ruby on the spot and dug up my cartridge of Pokemon X instead. And the rest, dear fellow gamers, is history—history that is now going to unfold under your very eyes.The first step was obviously to get my hands on an Espurr, the pre-evolution form of Meowstic. These adorable kittens can solely be found on Route 6, which involved cruising around with one of the starters until I reached the desired spot. I chose Fennekin and was surprised to get yet again a female Fennekin, just like during my first run of X. Given the low probability of getting a female version of that starter, I'm wondering if my cartridge is bugged or if I'm just extremely lucky. And talking about gender, I had to decide before capturing one of these adorable Espurr kittens if I wanted to cruise Kalos with a male or a female Meowstic. I was initially fonder of the male's colour palette and overall design, but his defensive and supportive move pool made him considerably more unfit for a solo run than his female counterpart, who boasted a more offensive move pool. My decision was thus made, and with a female Meowstic would I climb all the way to the Elite Four.The (deeply satisfying) playthrough that ensued could totally have been dubbed the \"I take back everything I ever thought about Psychic Pokemons\" run. See, since I started indulging in Pokemon solo runs, I always operated under the assumption that Psychic 'Mons were no solo run material. I envisioned them as crappy fighters centering mostly on supportive and defensive abilities and able to dish out little damage beyond easily curable status effects. Oh boy, how utterly wrong I was. But I finally saw the light thanks to my lovely and highly talented Meowstic, and I now laugh at my own former misconceptions while rubbing my hands and licking my chops at the though of the new soloing avenues that opened to me now that I saw the errors of my ways.To put it simply, the female version of Meowstic is an awesome fighter. That aloof cat with Chanel-ish elegance treated me to one of the most thrilling and enjoyable Pokemon solo run I've ever had, period. Not only does she have pretty decent stats—especially when it comes to Sp.Attack and Sp.Defense—but her move pool is absolutely staggering. Never before have I cruised with a 'Mon that can learn so many different types of special moves: on top of her trademark Psychic moves—which are beautifully destructive, en passant—my Meowstic could learn some Ghost moves, Bug moves, Electric moves and Grass moves as well as some Dark and Normal moves. Talk about a wide array of abilities! And since her Sp.Attack is quite high, lady Meowstic hits like a beast despite her delicate and gracious looks. Never judge a book by its cover indeed, and never assess a 'Mon's solo run abilities just by checking its type. The stats and move pool are what matters; and when it comes to the latter, the more moves, the merrier the solo run. By making my Meowstic learn moves belonging to four different types, I ensured that I would never struggle against any 'Mon—on top of keeping my run highly entertaining.Technical considerations aside, cruising Kalos again was immensely pleasant. I enjoyed it even more than the first time around, because I knew what to expect and was not bothered anymore by things that annoyed me during my first X run—such as the bunch of kids following me, the mass of coffee houses and hotels and the tipping. Heck, even Lumiose became enjoyable once I figured out safe ways to navigate it! I also managed to wrap my head around the Pokemon-Amie feature and to use it to great effect, effectively making my Meowstic and I become \"best friends forever\"—to quote the game's own words. On top of being enjoyable, the Pokemon-Amie petting-heavy and treat-laden brand of pampering produced stellar performances in battles, with my Meowstic routinely landing critical hits and avoiding attacks and status effects. Cherry on the cake—indeed—the Pokepuffs looked like choux à la crème, a fluffy and delicious French pastry. Miam! Apart from that, it was business as usual: I cruised around, took down every single Trainer and Gym Leader standing in my way, beat the Elite Four, shed a tear when AZ was reunited with his beloved 'Mon Floette, and enjoyed the whole trip immensely.In a nutshell, my Meowstic solo run of Pokemon X gloriously exceeded all my expectations. I had reservations regarding the possibility of tackling a solo run with a Psychic 'Mon, expecially one encountered after the first Gym rather than immediately at the start of the adventure; but my awesome lady Meowstic removed all these doubts with mighty punches of her cute little paws and taught me in the most glorious fashion that Psychic 'Mons can very much be solo run material. This was an wonderful solo run, and I look forward to tackling more solo runs with niche 'Mons—starting maybe with a male Meowstic, if only for the challenge of attempting a solo run with a mainly defensive 'Mon.

{"title": "Bits and Tidbits: Localization heaven", "date": "12/06/2016", "text": "This will be a short yet sweet post, as it's going to focus entirely on localization announcements that can only be described as mouth-watering. Without further ado, here are the happy winners that will be granted a Western release in the months to come!Tidbit#1: XSEED is planning to bring Akiba's Beat, Fate/Extella and Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns to North-America—and they are promising releases by the end of 2016, no less. There are no news yet about a European release of that trio, but that's not a problem as far as I'm concerned, because I will get my paws on these games no matter what. I'm particularly hyped up about Fate/Extella, which is a game I really didn't expect to see localized. Great job, XSEED!Tidbit#2: NIS America apparently teased a future Western release of Criminal Girls 2 at the end of their annual press event a couple of months ago—something I was totally unaware of. In the meantime, a release date has been confirmed as well as the presence of a healthy dose of censorship in the final product. Censorship or not, I'm certainly not going to miss that game after I enjoyed the first entry so much. I was just a bit confused by the fact that the game seemed to be available solely on NIS America's website and wondered anxiously if things would remain that way; however, a quick visit on Play-Asia revealed listings for both the North-American and European versions of the game, which considerably reassured me. Trust Play-Asia for providing us with the nichest of games!   Tidbit#3: While I'm talking about NIS, I fortuitously learnt that NIS' Europe Online Store sells a special edition of Grand Kingdom for the Vita. I was rather surprised to encounter that Special, because I had fully integrated the idea that there would be no special edition for the Vita version of Grand Kingdom. Well, apparently there is one, and it has started popping up on other merchant sites' listings as well. Now that's quite a late appearance, isn't it? At any rate, I already preordered the game alone, so this Special won't be mine.Tidbit#4: A physical release of Yomawari: Nights Alone for the Vita is planned this fall for both Europe and North-America. The interesting part is that it will come bundled with Hotaru no Nikki, with both games safely tucked on the same cartridge. I've been toying with the idea of giving the latter a try but never actually purchased it; and upon learning about that planned dual release, I'm immensely glad that I waited. Once again, a gorgeous special edition is available, but I'm going to pass on this one and concentrate rather on the game alone.That's it for the exciting gaming tidbits of the moment, dear fellow gamers. A lot of thrilling releases await us, and the gaming fall ahead promises to be bright indeed. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's delight: Fate is on my side", "date": "08/06/2016", "text": "Indeed, it is—courtesy of Play-Asia and of my lightning fast change of heart. I still have trouble believing that I managed to snatch that much-coveted Special, to be honest. But enough self-patting on the back; we're not here to dwell on how lucky I am, but rather to discover that gorgeous all-included special edition of Fire Emblem Fates.As you may have noticed, this is the Australian PAL edition. From what I've seen—or not seen in that case—the European edition of that Special is excruciatingly rare and nearly impossible to find, with only a couple of selected retailers stocking the thing and very little possibility to import it if you're not lucky enough to live in a country that hosts such retailers.Here's the full package in all its glory:The box contains a single cartridge with all three games safely tucked on it, yet unfortunately no booklet. I'm sad, I really am. The poster sports the exact same picture that's displayed on the box cover; as for the \"steelbook\", as it was called in the package's description, it is actually an extra metal case that can host the cartridge just as readily as its more mundane plastic counterpart. I still can't really fathom what's the point of including an extra case, but said case is undeniably pretty:Last but not least comes the 74-pages artbook, which turned out to be quite a nice surprise. It features a nice variety of illustrations sporting various graphical styles as well as unexpected inclusions such as an illustrated chronology of the series or a gallery of pixelated sprites. I didn't expect much out of that art book in the first place, but it ended up delighting me in earnest and is very much a valuable addition to that special edition.After having gazed amorously at that Special and taken pictures of it for this post, I'm going to indulge in something quite unusual for me: instead of squirreling that game away in my collection vault, I'm going to play it immediately. That will make it my first ever Fire Emblem game, and I can't wait to discover both the series and Fates. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "New Nintendo 3DS: Pet peeves", "date": "07/06/2016", "text": "After having played exclusively on a regular Nintendo 3DS for a couple of months, I decided to give a try to that shiny New 3DS I purchased last year. I had used it solely to play an (horrendous) hour of Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, which was definitely not enough to get a good grasp of that new iteration's pros and cons. The time had come to get a closer look, and thus I woke that New 3DS from its peaceful slumber and started playing it in earnest.I have to admit that I'm pretty satisfied by this iteration of the 3DS, which I deem the best of the whole 3DS line-up. (For the record, I own the regular New 3DS.) It is both considerably lighter than the 3DS XL and pleasantly rounder than the regular 3DS, which makes it quite comfortable to play. The screen is sharper and crisper than ever and easily beats the display of all the other 3DS models, with colours being especially bright and vivid. The size of the screen is also quite perfect: it's notably larger than in the regular 3DS while not being large to the point of generating pixelisation. In a nutshell, it's a great console; and should I purchase more backups for the 3DS line, they will definitely be New 3DS.Alas, as the title of this post hints, not everything is perfect. The New 3DS may be an excellent system overall, yet it suffers from a couple of hardly accountable design flaws that spoil the pleasure one can take in playing that ultimate 3DS iteration. I'm quite surprised that Nintendo gave the green light to the New 3DS without addressing these aggravating details:—The Power button is ridiculously tiny and hard to press. I understand Nintendo wanted to preserve players from switching off the system by mistake, but they went a tad too far in their quest for safety. That button is painfully uncomfortable to reach and press, and I've already grown sick of it after just a couple of days playing the console.—The stylus is not ergonomic enough. It's much too short and can thus quickly become uncomfortable to hold, and I really regret the retractable stylus of the regular 3DS. The tip is also too hard and too thin, which makes interactions with the touch screen rather unpleasant—not to mention that I'm constantly afraid of scratching it, something that didn't even cross my mind when wielding the DS stylus and its comfily soft tip.—The left analog stick manages to be both slippery and stiff, a deadly combination that can transform extended playing sessions in bouts of exquisite physical torture faster than you can say \"ouch, my poor thumb!\" As a matter of fact, I've developped some persistent thumb pain after playing the system for a few days, so I'm trying to avoid using that cursed analog stick and to make do with the D-pad instead. Such symptoms never occurred with my Vita or even with the regular 3DS model, so I'm pretty confident that the New 3DS is to blame and suffers from a bad case of crappy analog stick.—Last but not least, the battery life is pitifully short. I was playing the DS a short time ago and the differences between the two machines in that regard are staggering. Even with the 3D feature totally disabled, I hardly manage to squeeze more than 4-or-so hours of play out of my New 3DS before it begs to be recharged yet again. This is a really poor performance, especially for a console that's supposed to be portable. Dealing with the pathetic battery life of that thing is already galling enough when playing exclusively at home, but it must be ten times more of a hassle when playing on the go. Which I'm glad I never do.Maybe I'm the only New 3DS owner bothered by these defects—but then again, maybe not. It find quite troubling that Nintendo managed to nail near-perfect designs with the DS Lite and the DSi yet somehow failed to reproduce that feat with the 3DS line-up. All 3DS iterations suffer from blatant flaws, from the excessive weight of the 3DS XL to the low-quality screen of the 2DS to the uncomfortable angular shape and propension to screen-scratching of the regular 3DS—and the New 3DS, which should have been the ultimate and most perfect incarnation of the console, is just as rife with shortcomings as its elders. I'm not going to scream doom&decadence and prophesy the upcoming death of Ninty, but I can honestly say that their newfound unability to come up with stellar designs douses my already very moderate enthusiam for the NX.

{"title": "Coveted games: Summer '16", "date": "02/06/2016", "text": "My collecting days may be numbered, but that doesn't mean that they won't be epic and memorable. I firmly intend to retire from collecting fully sated after a glorious final string of gaming purchases; and luckily for me, the summer '16 release schedule seems more than willing to indulge me and accommodate my magnificent plans. Without further ado, here's my wishlist for what may be my last summer of collecting! Enjoy, and don't hesitate to share your own coveted games in the comment section!Shiren the Wanderer: The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate (Vita): A Shiren game on the Vita, of all things! To say that I'm overjoyed with that release is pretty much an understatement. As the interminable title doesn't say, this is the fifth instalment in the Shiren series and the last one so far. Since it was initially released in 2010 for the DS in Japan only, this makes me wonder if the series has come to a halt. I sure hope it's not the case, and I'll keep my fingers crossed for a sixth entry on the Vita. 7th Dragon III Code: VFD (3DS): That game with a cryptic title will be the first 7th Dragon instalment ever released in the West; and since it's a dungeon crawler, I must get it absolutely. In fact, I already did so by purchasing the Japanese version a mere couple of days before the western release was announced—that certainly taught me a thing or two regarding the value of patience in all things collecting, thank you very much—but that won't prevent me from snatching the North-American version as well.MeiQ: Labyrinth of Death (Vita): Yet another first-person dungeon crawler is gracing the Vita. *heavy breathing* What more can I say? Joy and glory! One can never own too many dungeon crawlers, oh no precious. Giddiness at the prospect of expanding my already massive dungeon crawler collection aside, I'm pleasantly surprised by the fact that MeiQ is going to be granted a physical release. Idea Factory, I do love you. Gaming love declarations aside, MeiQ is part of the so-called \"Makai Ichiban Kan\" project, a Dept. Heaven-like gaming venture orchestrated by Compile Heart that comprises two games so far—MeiQ and Trillion God of Destruction. The project looks fairly promising and I'm really curious to see which games will come next.The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 2 (Vita): I got the first half, so I must get the second. Not much to add, really. Next!Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse (3DS): Let's face it, this game will not be physically released in Europe, and the digital version will very likely come to our shores a full year after the North-American boxed version. If it comes to our shores at all, that is. I say, let's save ourselves the trouble of waiting for a blotched European release and purchase the shiny physical North-American version instead, shall we? Well, that's what I'll be doing, at least. I just wish this game had been given a title that fully showcases the fact that it's a brand-new Shin Megami Tensei entry and not yet another one of these enhanced remakes that plague the 3DS library.That's only five games, which is quite reasonable. My collecting, like all things, will benefit from a refreshing summer break; and hopefully I will emerge from the summer with my collecting zest replenished and fully ready to tackle the epic collecting autumn that awaits us.

{"title": "Play in Progress: Pokemon run reports", "date": "30/05/2016", "text": "My recent Pokemon addiction is still roaring and shows no signs of abating. On top of polishing off Blue, I've been trying to tie up a couple of loose ends in other Pokemon entries these last days—with more or less success. Without further ado, here's a round-up of my late Pokemon activities:—Pokemon Blue: My run ended as quietly as it had started, after an anticlimatic final showdown with newly anointed League Champion Red. As I didn't mention in my last post, my run of Blue was a Squirtle solo run, and it was too ridiculously easy to be truly entertaining. Nobody could resist the massive blows of my overleveled Squirtle and the fact that Gym Leaders nearly never resorted to potions made my progression even more boringly effortless. I have nothing interesting to add about that run, so I'm going to explain the reasoning behind my Squirtle's nickname instead: I'm playing the French version of the game, and Squirtle's french name is \"Carapuce\", which is a pun on the words \"carapace\" (shell) and \"puce\" (flea). I decided to extract the last part of the name and to transform it into \"pupuce\", which is a lovely nickname that can be translated into \"honey bee\", \"pumpkin\", \"sweetie\" and the like. Hence a delicious irony when my lovely Pupuce evolved into an enormous monster of an fortified turtle. Now that's Poke-linguistics for you! —Pokemon Black: I learnt some time ago that unbeknownst to me, I had accomplished a feat of sorts by clearing solo runs of Black and White with two 'Mons belonging to the Neverused Tier, i.e. Liepard and Samurott. Or rather nearly cleared in the case of Black, since I stopped playing after the first encounter with the Elite Four; however, knowing that I had managed to make my way through Unova with two 'Mons deemed as crappy fighters filled me with pride and prompted me to pick up Black again and finish the job. I leveled up my Purry all the way to Lv.100 and I'm now trying to tackle the Elite Four a second time around. It's not working too well so far—especially against the Figthting Champion, as you may imagine—and I may have to allow fainting&reviving if I want to overcome that hurdle; but I'm quite convinced that beating the Elite Four with my Liepard is an attainable feat. I'll keep trying, I promise!—Pokemon Heart Gold: After polishing off Blue, I decided to wrap up my interrupted run of Heart Gold by exploring revamped Kantoh. I progressed without a hitch through a much more lovely and colourful version of the mother of all Pokemon regions; however, I got bored after a while and ditched the game yet again after beating the Fuschia City Gym Leader. Kantoh is overall a pretty dull and uninspired region—especially compared to regions from latter entries—and extra colours and details cannot work miracles and single-handedly make it breathtakingly interesting. That's all for this play-in-progress report, dear fellow gamers. A bit heavy on the Pokemon side, maybe—but that is bound to change, as I'm currently pondering several games belonging to others franchises for immediate playthroughs. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Blue: Inglorious beginnings (a.k.a. The Blastoise Solo Run)", "date": "27/05/2016", "text": "The Pokemon rampage is still going on full force, to my wonderment and delight; and after my run of White, I decided to make an audacious jump to the monochromous roots of the series. I wanted to see at long last where and how it all started, and so I dug up my Blue cartridge bought two years ago, my silver GBA and dove into yet another playthrough of a Pokemon game. And the result... Well, the result was unlike anything I'd have expected. In a good and bad way.I'll be blunt: from what I've played of Blue so far, I totally and utterly fail to understand how that game could single-handedly drag the Gameboy out of its early retirement and sell millions of cartridges around the world. I fail even more to understand how it could take Gamefreak nearly six years to come up with that game— notwithstanding that the development phase was an on-and-off process. Because what I'm seeing and playing right now is nothing more than a half-baked, clunky and overall barely decent RPG. For all the praise nostalgic players lavish upon it, the first Pokemon generation is shockingly unpolished compared to later generations and to other Gameboy RPGs—and here's how:—It takes but a glance to realize that Blue's graphics are shockingly primitive, even by Gameboy standards. Such over-simplistic graphics would have been acceptable in the early stages of the console's lifetime; but in 1995, they were horribly dated. This is worsened by the fact that Tajiri and his team obviously didn't put a lot of effort into embellishing their game world; voluntarily or not, they did only the bare minimum in that regard and left it at that. Trees look like boulders, tall grass looks like sprouts and so on. Good thing that I knew beforehand that Tajiri intended to channel the lushness of untamed nature in Blue/Red, because I certainly wouldn't have guessed it from seeing Blue's graphics.—The pacing is quite terrible. Blue feels like a long plodding trudge for the most part: tension and excitement are absent, goals are embarrassingly vague and there is very little incentive to move on to the next spot in line. Had I not known the Pokemon formula inside out, I'm not sure I would have been able to spell out what I was precisely supposed to achieve in that game. This impotent pacing is considerably worsened by the fake longevity-friendly bane of old-school RPGs, i.e. regular obstructions that require talking to every single NPC, scouring the whole game world and generally performing ludicrous actions to be overcome. I admit it: I resorted to internet wisdom more than once during my run of Blue. I didn't feel like fine-combing every town to find a beverage for the gate guards, nor could I bring myself to try to get my paws on a bike. And let's not even talk about the game actually forcing me to capture ten different 'Mons in order to get a mandatory item. To my dismay, there were also all too many occurrences of another annoying old-school RPG trope, the dreaded \"Where do I go next?\" For all their twisted retro charm, these hindrances gave me the unpleasant feeling of progressing by fits and starts without ever managing to find a flowing playing rhythm. Granted, it's a first-playthrough-only issue—but an aggravating one nonetheless. —The inventory is absolutely horrendous. I found myself staring at the thing in disbelief and wondering if this was a bad joke of sorts. Twenty spots only in the bag? And fifty more only in the PC? No subcategories? No automatic sortering? Seriously, this is a pure ergonomic nightmare. It's nearly as bad as FFL2—except that FFL2 has the excuse of having been released five years before Blue.—While the inventory is horrendous, the move management is nothing short of calamitous. I just cannot believe the fact that there is absolutely no way to check the elemental nature of moves, their base strength and, last but not least, their effects. What were they thinking, seriously? Were players supposed to test moves at random and reload their save files if they were not happy with the results? Heck, I guess that's exactly what they were supposed to do. It's pretty obvious that elemental complementaries and strategy as a whole were but an afterthought in the first generation and that the meat and potatoes of Red/Blue was the completion of the Pokedex.—The narrative is weak, superficial and childish to a fault. Take resident rival Red: why does this guy even challenge me in the first place and why does he resent me so vehemently? Sure, I guess I wouldn't be happy either if my own grandfather couldn't remember my name and if he offered the kid next door a 'Mon before offering me one; but honestly, Red's dislike is fickle at best and totally baseless at worst. You can also forget about the gentle holistic vibe introduced by latter entries of the series, with their emphasis on human/pokemon collaboration: pretty much everybody in Kantoh is an immature prick whose sole joy in life is to use their 'Mons as mere tools to challenge random passerby to glorified rooster fights. Jeez, now I understand why the series was initially accused of promoting animal abuse. Also, I don't know if this is specific to the french traduction I'm playing, but the language used by NPCs is pretty sloppy and aggressive, with abbreviations that shouldn't be seen in written text, invasive slang and insults thrown at my face on a regular basis. Bloody obnoxious Red routinely calls me a punk and a loser—despite the fact that I pulverize him every time we fight, which is quite laughable—and random people rebuff me way too often for my taste and comfort. I could have done without all that callousness, thank you very much. Dialogues are also incredibly vapid compared to latter entries, in which even the most insignificant NPC is granted interesting and instructive lines that give a better understanding of the local region. —The level design is quite poor. Wild areas between towns sport an uncanny amount of empty space whose monotony is broken solely by the rows of Trainers standing around idly. Towns, on the other hand, are annoyingly labyrinthine, with a ridiculously high number of ledges, fences, bushes and other obstacles whose sole purpose seems to be to force the player into detours. (I'm looking murderously at you, Fuschia City.)Let's wrap this up: I'm not impressed by the early stages of the Pokemon series. I'm so totally not impressed that Blue can now claim the dubious honour of being my least favourite Pokemon entry. While this game obviously delights the retro gamer in me with its old-school trappings, it leaves the Poke aficionado in me pretty unsated. Without nostalgia to make the heart grow fonder, the first generation is nothing more than a passable try with a lot of room for improvement. And boy, was there indeed improvement! Playing Blue made me fully realize the extent of the vertiginous progress that took place throughout the series. The Pokemon formula has been beautifully and cleverly refined over time; and with all due respect to nostalgic players who discovered the series with Blue/Red, the latest Pokemon instalments are the pinnacle of sophistication compared to these coarse beginnings. With that, dear fellow gamers, I rest my case. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's delight: Recto-verso", "date": "21/05/2016", "text": "Halfway between reversible clothing and drawings hidden under manga jackets, two-sided cover foils are the new en vogue gaming Easter Egg. I discovered the existence of that trend as I was checking my newly received copy of Trillion God of Destruction: my sharp eyes spotted unaccountable patches of colours through the box' interstices, and a keener examination revealed the unthinkable: the cover fold was illustrated on both sides! I was so elated by that unexpected discovery that I immediatly started inspecting the rest of my Vita collection; and to my utter delight, I uncovered more of these recto-verso covers. Here are the most memorable ones in all their colourful glory!In addition to these exclusive covers, I also found some interesting variations on other games. Illustrations devoid of text are featured behind the cover folds of several Hyperdimension games, Trails of Cold Steel's cover fold sports both the European and North-American art for the game (Trillion does the same with the Japanese and Western art) and the Asian version of Moe Chronicles has a reversible English/Chinese cover. But what about 3DS games, you may ask? Well, although they are not as keen on that trend as Vita games, I managed to extract two gorgeous examples from my collection:These alternative covers are often strikingly more beautiful than the official ones—so much so that I decided to leave a couple of them in place. They also tend to be starker and more sober, evacuating text and logos to focus on a more unified and stylish overall look, and they don't hesitate to wallow in kawaisa and moe-inducing designs. (This culminates in the cover of Stranger of Sword City, whose sole gimmick and purpose is to offer a kawaii version of the original character designs to moe-hungry players.) It's fascinating to see how the simple act of shifting a game cover can give a totally new vibe to said game; this is the kind of exquisite detail that makes physical games valuable and provides excellent incentive to purchase them, on top of adding a nice element of surprise to the discovery of new games. Now that I'm aware of the existence of that lovely feature, I'll keep my eyes peeled and check every new Vita game for a hidden cover design. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon White: The Samurott Solo Run", "date": "20/05/2016", "text": "Here we go again! It seems that I just can't get enough of Pokemon these days, as I just cleared my third solo run in a row and am still left wanting more. When and where will this Pokemon rampage stop? I have no idea; but as for my Oshawott solo run of White, it ended up in the most glorious fashion after roughly 18 hours of fulfilling play. I finally wrapped up that unfinished business with the Elite Four and the Champion and wiped the floor with them all. They couldn't stand the assaults of my Lv.100 Samurott, could they? No, they couldn't. Still, they put up quite a fight, and I had to use an uncanny number of Full Restores during both Elite Four showdowns. My verdict regarding the solo run-friendliness of the resident Black/White Water Starter goes as such: Oshawott is undeniably a better choice for a solo run than Purrloin, yet he remains undeniably inferior to his Diamond/Pearl counterpart Piplup. What you can expect when cruising around with the samurai otter alone is a neatly balanced solo run, neither too painfully hard nor too boringly easy. To my utter delight, this solo run of White was much more pleasant that my recent solo run of Black. The in-game weather played a huge part, as Spring Unova is definitely cosier and more welcoming than Winter Unova; and since I knew what to expect from Unova as a whole, I was not repulsed anymore by its urban and slightly barren vibe. Heck, I even came to love it to some extent! Not only is industrial Unova a pretty consistent region in its own right, but it also brings some welcome variety to the Pokemon region pool. I also tolerated Cheren and Bianca a lot better after figuring out that their behaviour had a symbolic meaning tied to the game's overall message: Bianca and the obvious limitations that she's forced to acknowledge embody the Truth, while Cheren and his drive to succeed and be the best at all costs embody the Ideal. That doesn't make them lovelier or more likeable, but their polarized and seemingly unreasonable behaviours are not as hard to swallow once one knows that they are supposed to be personifications of concepts rather than kawaii sidekicks. Although I'm racking my brain in search for something to add, there is really nothing more to say; and that's not too surprising, given that I already wrote two full reports about Black—one about my Purrloin solo run and one about my overall impression of the game. I will thus leave it at that, even though it makes that post look more like a glorified footnote than like a true run report. My Oshawott solo run was a jolly good one that somehow reconciled me with the Fifth Generation as a whole, and I'm now more thrilled at the prospect of playing White 2 and Black 2 than, say, at the end of my solo run of Black.

I was surprised by the presentation of the thing: although the description at Play-Asia seems to imply that this limited physical edition is a Special of sorts, with the use of the world \"bundle\" and an appetizing list of featured items, the final product is actually more akin to a low-budget custom-made edition—which is exactly what it is, en passant. As a result, there was no outer box and the game and OST were sent separately, unceremoniously bundled by a rubber band:The box contains a full-colour booklet and a reversible poster:This is really just a regular PSP game with a poster and a soundtrack CD on top, but it's remarkable as one of the last of its kind and as a true work of love and passion. The fact that the UMD is a proprietary format that is no longer produced nowadays means that there will very likely be no more physical releases for the PSP and that the homebrew scene for this console will be emulator-based. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if Gajinworks had to ditch the planned limited physical edition of Class of Heroes 3 for an impossibility to procure UMDs. But let's wait and see—and hopefully play!

{"title": "Pokemon Heart Gold: The Typhlosion Solo Run", "date": "11/05/2016", "text": "I dove into Heart Gold immediatly after wrapping up my Purrloin solo run of Black and was treated to a pleasantly different experience. Heart Gold and Black may belong to the same franchise and be hosted by the same console, but they are far from being similar games. As a matter of fact, although Heart Gold looks every bit like a DS Pokemon entry, it takes only a little playing to realize that it actually hails from an older and less sophisticated gaming era.Indeed, Heart Gold is a enhanced remake of Gameboy Color instalment Pokemon Gold, and this antiquity shows quite vividly despite the brilliant revamping and rehauling that the game went through. The major difference that immediatly struck me is how tinier the Johto region is compared to Sinnoh and Unova. Not only that, but it's also incredibly cosier and more homely. Johto treated me to the most mellow, friendly and heartwarming atmosphere I ever basked in in a Pokemon game. In fact, cruising around Johto feels more like taking a stroll in a glorified backyard than like roaming a vast unknown world in which adventure and excitement await at every corner. Not that it's a bad thing, mind you: I love the series first and foremost for its sweet and comforting vibe, and Heart Gold sure has that vibe in spades.The progression in Heart Gold is also considerably less linear and streamlined than in DS and 3DS instalments. Not only is it mandatory to backtrack a number of times, but there are less clues regarding where the player is supposed to head to after clearing a given task. I found myself at a loss and fumbling around a couple of times—something I never experienced before in any Pokemon entry. The approach to HMs is also notably different: not only does Johto sport decidedly more HMs-restricted areas than Sinnoh&co, but its fauna is also much more reluctant to learn HM moves. HM slaves are nowhere to be found in Johto and I had to capture and release a good number of 'Mons before I finally got my paws on HM wielders. Playing Heart Gold is like sneaking a peek at the early stages of the series, when Game Freak was still experimenting to find the perfect Pokemon formula; it shows beautifully how much the series has evolved over time despite repeated accusations of the contrary.Here's a quick digest of my run—which, as the title abundantly implies, was yet another solo run. I chose Cyndaquil solely for his looks, and his evolutions didn't dissapoint me. To see him trail behind me as I was roaming Johto made my heart melt, so much so that I wish this feature were available in more Pokemon entries. And taking about melting heart, there were so many adorable 'Mons cruising Johto that I was constantly itching to throw Pokeballs around—before remembering that I was supposed to run solo. (Well, at least I spotted a couple of fitting candidates for future solo runs.) My run went quite smoothly and without a hitch, to the point of qualifying as my Easiest Pokemon Run Ever by the time I was done with the Elite Four. My Cyndaquil leveled up at the speed of light and I don't remember struggling against any trainer or Gym Leader, let alone against the Champion. Maybe postgame revamped Kanto would have proven more of a challenge, but I decided not to explore it and put an end to my playthrough instead. The reason for this untimely demission is simple: I yet have to play the Gameboy instalments and I don't want to spoil myself. Once I'm done discovering Kanto in its original monochromatic guise, I'll go back to Heart Gold and roam colourful revamped Kanto. In the meantime, Trainer Gold and his faithful Typhlosion will have to lounge about in Vermilion City, where I left them after 15:30 hours of fulfilling play.Cruising Johto was so delightful that I'm seriously tempted to get my paws on a Pokemon Crystal cartridge to discover the original version of that lovely region. Let's see what Amazon and Ebay have in store for a Poke-aficionado eager to dive into the retro depths of the series, shall we? Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collecting: I've had my fill—well, nearly", "date": "09/05/2016", "text": "Still getting some nice catch—but for how long?I've been collecting games for five blissful years now and that collecting has been a constant source of joy, happiness and satisfaction. It very much still is, but one thing cannot be denied: I'm slowly but surely starting to feel sated.This evolution shouldn't be too surprising, mind you. The main motivation behind my collecting was twofold: collecting was partly driven by a burning desire to overcompensate for my years away from gaming and to fulfill at long last my childhood dream of being able to purchase games to my heart's content, and partly driven by a firm intention to constitute a pool of gaming systems and games that would be there for the (re)playing in years to come. It's hard to deny that after five years of intense—and intensive—collecting, these two objectives have been reached several times over. My old frustration of not being able to indulge in my wildest game purchasing fantasies has been totally erased and is now but a distant memory; and with five gaming systems and hundreds of games at my disposal, I have enough gaming material for decades. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if I grew bored of gaming or if arthritis caught my thumbs and wrists before I'm done playing all the games in my collection.On top of that, collecting games is slowly but surely losing its edge over the years to become business as usual, so to speak. The initial thrill of hunting for games has been dampened by time and hundreds of gaming purchases and I've become a trifle desensitized to the whole thing, going from browsing Ebay and Amazon for hours on end to hunt for the perfect bargain to placing preorders and grouping purchases in a perfectly blasé way. Long gone is the time when getting a good bargain on a game could illuminate my whole day; now I'm purchasing games in a rational and dispassionate way, methodically shearing my wishlist of the moment. Gaming purchases are still a great source of joy and I've not grown jaded towards the whole thing yet, but I could very much become so in the years to come. Heck, I'm already completely burnt out on special editions—what's the next step? I don't want my collecting to go down in my personal gaming history as something that I surfeited myself with, but rather as an pleasant endeavour that I wisely stopped before I got sick of it. This led me to an crucial decision: I'm going to stop collecting games in the years to come, while collecting is still enjoyable. More specifically, I will ensure that my collecting stops with the 3DS and the Vita. Once these two bail out, I will not shift my collecting to other systems but rather deliberately stop collecting altogether. That doesn't mean that I will stop buying games entirely: I will very likely keep purchasing the odd game here and there, but that will become an isolated occurrence rather than a regular activity. But what about next gen handhelds, you may ask? Well, if there are any AND if I decide to invest in some of them, I will do so in a more carefree and less involved way. I will not collect for them and I will only purchase and play the very best games they have to offer. In a nutshell, future consoles will be nothing more than side dishes, the main courses being my five current handhelds—Vita, 3DS, PSP, DS and GBA, a.k.a. the Fab Five. The announced end of my collecting endeavours obviously doesn't mean that I will stop playing games and blogging about them—let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater, shall we? My precious collection is sizeable enough to provide gaming and writing material for many years to come, so I won't retire from gaming and blogging any time soon. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's delight: A most bewitching edition", "date": "08/05/2016", "text": "I've been pining for a Western release of DS RPG Ni no Kuni for years, praying that a publisher would treat us to a late release à la Summon Night 5. However, it's now been three years since the DS was discontinued and it's becoming painfully obvious that such a miraculous late release will not happen. I thus decided to import at long last a Japanese copy of the game, which was quite the smooth task: even nowadays, finding a cheap brand-new copy of Ni no Kuni is surprisingly easy.The DS version of Ni no Kuni is famous for sporting a companion book and thus nearly qualifying as a special edition in terms of size and content. From what I've understood, the book is more or less mandatory to enjoy the game to the fullest, which may have played a part in the decision to not bring Ni no Kuni to our shores. It also makes the outer box quite imposing, resulting in the use of cardboard in lieu of plastic. The box is wrapped in a paper sheet similar to a classic videogame cover, which can be peeled to reveal the box underneath and its gorgeous motifs:The book is a true work of art as well as love. It sports a luxurious gilded hardcover, and the inside is no less beautiful: pages are made of a beautiful ancient-looking brown paper and bristle with splendid illustrations completed with gracious adornments and curlicues. See for yourselves the beauty of that thing:The variety of subjects covered in this splendid tome seems to be staggering, ranging from spells to a complete bestiary to an exhaustive description of all the game's items—and much, much more. I particularly appreciate the fact that the pronunciation of all kanji is included, which will be of great help for the Japanese beginner I still am.In a nutshell, Ni no Kuni is a valuable addition to my precious collection and I am utterly delighted by that purchase. I can only encourage players who have even the slightest interest in that game to make their move and order it whilst there are still many cheap copies available. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Bravely Default: The true meaning of the ending (spoilers!)", "date": "05/05/2016", "text": "Bravely Default's ending is thoroughly confusing, that much cannot be denied. However, a consensus of sorts has been reached regarding that complicated matter since the game's release. Most players now agree on the fact that Tiz was possessed by some entity at the very beginning of the game, which allowed him to wake up from his coma and play an active part in saving the world. There are still some disagreements regarding the exact nature of the entity that made themselves at home in Tiz' body, though: some claim that said entity was Airy's sister whilst others firmly maintain that said entity was none other than the player themselves, assuming the identity of a being from another dimension. The debate is still ongoing and no satisfying solution has been found to this riddle so far.My own conclusion regarding the exact nature of the events unfolding in Bravely Default discards the two aforementioned options to focus on a third way that was never seriously pondered by the game's aficionados—at least not to the best of my knowledge. That conclusion is based on a bold premise: although everybody assumed that it was the case, absolutely nothing tells us that Tiz was the sole party member to be possessed by an entity. My conclusion goes as such: Tiz was indeed possessed by Airy's sister, whilst the player was taking control of none other than Agnès.Yes, Agnès. The crystal Vestal herself. Although this theory may seem ludicrous at first sight, there are actually a lot of elements that support it in the game itself. Here are my five proofs that the player does in fact possess Agnès:Proof#1: It may seem like I'm stating the obvious, but Agnès is the true main character of Bravely Default. She's featured prominently in the game's official art—including the European cover of the game, which shows her in the foreground—and the game's story revolves around her quest to reawaken the Crystals. Tiz may be the first party member to be introduced, but he joins Agnès in her mission, not the opposite. Since she's the main character, it only makes sense that the player should possess her rather than one of her sidekicks.  Proof#2: The opening AR sequence shows Agnès begging us, the player, to intervene in order to save the world. Since she's the one who's begging and since the world's rescue is directly tied to the Crystals that are in her care, it makes considerably more sense that the being from another dimension incarnated by the player should choose to possess her body in order to lend a hand in saving the world rather than the body of a random boy who has no link whatsoever with the Crystals. Now, one could argue that the AR movie closes with Agnès uttering the words \"become my Warrior of Light\", which obviously refers to another person who's very likely Tiz; however, this was \"added in translation\", so to speak. The original Japanese text ends a bit differently, with Agnès begging you to save the world \"as a Warrior of Light\" (\"Anata ga Hikari no Senshi to shite\"). Not her Warrior; a Warrior. And since all four party members are referred to as \"Warriors of Light\" throughout the game, this term can technically apply to every one of them—including Agnès herself. Moreover, it's worth noting that Agnès is the only party member who interacts with us during her AR sequence. Coincidence? I don't think so. Proof#3: Airy's sister appears only at the very beginning and at the very end. The question is: where is she in the meantime? If she wants to save the world that badly, to the point of recruiting the player, then surely she should lend a hand with that paramount enterprise, right? This apparent contradiction evaporates as soon as one postulates that Airy's sister does indeed lend a hand, using Tiz as her vehicle whilst the player uses Agnès as theirs. It only makes sense that Airy's sister should monitor the party's progression and take an active part in saving the world rather than leave such an important business in the hands of a random being from another dimension, be they genuinely motivated to help. Moreover, the way she talks to the player during the closing sequence suggests that she knows exactly what transpired and that herself and said player have been performing a collaborative work, which implies that she must have been around rather than hidden away.Proof#4: During the final fight, Ouroboros dons Tiz' form and addresses him, claiming that a celestial lurks within him. One could easily assume that said celestial is the player; however, Ouroboros describes the celestial realm as \"prosperous, full of love, beneficent, reverential and orderly\" and adds that \"it knows no war or strife\". That description can hardly apply to our world, which means that the celestial must be someone else than the player. (On top of that, the idea that Ouroboros could want to destroy our world is totally absurd and would fall flat in the most pathetic way.) It makes sense to assume that the celestial is Airy's sister, all the more so as the nature and origin of the Crystal Fairies is never precised in the game; Airy serves Ouroboros, but nothing prevents her from being a celestial. And if Airy's sister occupies Tiz' body, then the player must be hosted by another party member—i.e. Agnès. Proof#5: A.k.a. the ultimate proof: the possession of Agnès by the player is totally and utterly consistent with the events unfolding in the game's alternate ending. Not only does the uninterrupted pressing of the x button correspond to an in-game action performed by Agnès, i.e. the injection of energy into the Crystal, but the rest of the crew states in no uncertain terms that they will align with Agnès' decisions and support her actions. Tiz being the party member possessed by the player would totally undermine the importance of that alternate ending and create a massive contradiction: it would make no sense at all that the game's supreme gift of free will to the player would be performed by another character than the one supposedly possessed by said player. Moreover, this argument can be expanded to all the rituals of awakening performed on the Crystals throughout the game: the player is one with Agnès during these phases and is very literally lending their energy to her by pressing the x button. If Agnès is channeling us during the rituals of awakening, then it only makes sense to assume that she's doing so at all times.Proofs aside, this theory can very conveniently explain and justify a lot of elements in Bravely Default—on top of reconciling both theories regarding who exactly possesses Tiz. For instance, Tiz being so eager to follow Agnès in her quest barely five minutes after meeting her can be justified by RPG conventions for sure, but also by the fact that Airy's sister is possessing him and prompting him to act that way. This theory also nicely explains why both Tiz and Agnès are considerably more transparent than Edea and Ringabel personality-wise: that's because they are vessels of other beings and as such, a part of their personality is suppressed. Of course, it doesn't solve every single contradiction lurking in Bravely Default's story; however, most of these contradictions are inherent to the use of the \"meta\" theme. Meta is just like Time Travel: it looks like a perfect concept bound to give birth to thrilling developments on paper, but it's basically impossible to include it in a story without generating a milling mass of paradoxes and plotholes. In Bravely Default, the main paradox is the imperfect inclusion of the player in the game: on one hand, we are supposed to inhabit one of the party members' body, but on the other hand, we are at times required to take control of other party members and we generally have to perform plenty of actions as a fully external player aware that they are playing a game—like saving, watching cutscenes, changing the party members' order and equipment, choosing actions for all characters in battle and so on. The meta-isation of the story is incomplete, so to speak, and is bound to remain so no matter which party member the player is actually possessing.I like to imagine that this setting was designed as an Easter Egg of sorts, a plot twist that can only be uncovered through a minute examination of the game's story. Of course, I could also be completely wrong; but I fancy thinking I'm right on this one. The proofs are here, and let's be honest: the idea of being hosted by the authentic main character of Bravely Default is indoubtedly more alluring than the idea of playing second fiddle into one of her sidekicks.

{"title": "Bravely Default: A stroke of genius (spoilers!)", "date": "29/04/2016", "text": "Let's face it: if Bravely Default's gameplay is deeply fulfilling, its story is barely satisfactory. First, it is unnecessarily convoluted and full of superfluous elements. Ringabel being an Alternis Dim from another world who lost his memory in the tranfer? Unneeded, and probably implemented solely to fill the amnesic character/evil twin quota. A version of Agnes from yet another world popping up centuries in the past and being referred to as a angel fallen from the skies? Unneeded as well, and sorely confusing to boot. The story would have functioned just as well without these two elements—and without a ton of others. Secondly, the storytelling is so utterly messy, confusing and clumsy that following the story is more a trudge than a delight. Thirdly, the meta premise of the player being cast as a being from another dimension who enters the body of the main hero to help them save the world is a trifle patronizing. Every RPG player with a bit of experience is fully aware that they are projecting their own self into the main character(s) and don't need to have that notion shoved down their throat by Square Enix—like, \"thank you, Captain Obvious\". But not all is poorly told and unconvincing: there are also some amazingly good bites in Bravely Default's narrative—starting with the game's alternative ending, which I would qualify as nothing less than an absolute stroke of genius.  Dubbed \"Lying Airy\", this ending is available from chapter 5 up until the awakening of the ultimate crystal in chapter 8 and must be triggered by disobeying Airy's instructions and shattering a crystal. This is achieved by keeping on pressing the x button after Airy orders you to stop doing so, and this maneuver can technically be performed on any crystal from chapter 5 onwards—although it's highly recommended to wait until chapter 7 or 8, since the time needed to shatter a crystal is directly tied to the strength of your party and thus to their levels.The stroke of genius does not lie in this ending's narrative content, which is hardly worth mentioning, but rather in the process leading to its triggering. \"Lying Airy\" is not triggered by the obtention of hidden flags or by a dialogue choice like most alternative endings, but rather by a specific gameplay maneuver resulting from a conscious choice made by the player. Shattering a crystal is never presented as a viable alternative by the game; the possibilitity of doing so is only suggested through hints and speculations uttered by the characters. Moreover, shattering a crystal involves disobeying Airy's intructions, and scores of RPGs taught us that we should not disobey guiding creatures that are kind enough to lend us a hand in saving the world. The amount of scepticism and boldness required to cross the Rubicon and disobey Airy is staggering, and yet it feels like a perfectly natural thing to do thanks to the clever way the game brings the matter.The hint hidden in the title from chapter 6 onwards immediatetly comes to mind: what a brilliant way to hint at the truth, bound to either arouse suspicions or confirm them! Chapter 6 also sees the party mull over the situation and wonder whether waking up the crystals is the right thing to do, whether Airy may have ulterior motives and, most importantly, what would exactly happen if Agnès kept pouring energy into a crystal until it shattered instead of stopping doing so when Airy orders it. After that intense musing, they drop the subject and don't mention it anymore in subsequent chapters. I first deemed this a serious mishap, wondering why the story was not expanding on these suspicions; yet a mishap this is not, but rather a brilliant narrative device. The characters are not drawing conclusions from their abundant suspicions because it's up to the player to do so themselves and act accordingly, in a vertiginous display of free gaming will.This is a pretty unique setup that I've never encountered in any other RPG, at least not in such an achieved and polished form. A similar arrangement can be found in Link's Awakening, in which the player follows the instructions of a helpful mysterious creature before a bunch of hints arouses suspicions regarding the ultimate goal promoted by said mysterious creature, which may not be as wholesome as it seemed at first sight. The player can then exercise their free will and refuse to follow the creature's instructions in order not to trigger a dramatic outcome. However, that option is not a true choice but rather a defaulting of sorts that's not planned by the game; as such, it doesn't lead to a specific ending, but rather to an eternal statu quo. Bravely Default went much further than Link's Awakening and enriched the mix with a specific gameplay action and a dedicated ending, leading to a much more compelling result. All in all, this alternative ending is absolutely brilliant, ingenious, clever and whatever synonyms you can think of, so much so that it pretty much single-handedly makes me forget the shortcomings of the narrative. I am utterly grateful to Bravely Default for having treated me to such an original, fresh and thrilling experience, and I can only hope that Bravely Second will have similar delightful surprises in store.

{"title": "Pokemon Black: A dark patch on my Pokemon résumé", "date": "27/04/2016", "text": "Although I certainly enjoyed my run of Pokemon Black and didn't have to force myself to pick up my DS and play it, this game has earned the dubious honour of being my least favourite Pokemon entry so far. This is due to a myriad of tiny reasons that would have hardly been noticeable on their own yet lead to a great deal of annoyance when put together. Without further ado, here are the joy-killers that tainted my overall view of Pokemon Black:—Unova is a rather unpleasant region that comes across as significantly less welcoming, bucolic and heart-warming than regions from other Pokemon entries. Unlike the Northern France inspiration at work in the X/Y pair, the New York state inspiration behind Unova didn't lead to an incredibly charming result full of Western exotism. For some reason that I cannot pinpoint, the whole area feels cold, barren and oozes a vague aura of menace—an overall impression that was reinforced by the fact that my run unfolded in the greyish and washed-out colour palette of the in-game winter. The North-American mystique is curiously absent from Unova: apart from the swarms of office workers in Castelia City's streets and the patrolling of rangers, there is little that evokes the USA. Where are the diners and fast-food joints? There were tons of cafés in Kalos, so certainly Unova could have sported a couple of these iconic American places, right? And why are people sitting on cushions in front of low tables at home just like in Japan? That makes absolutely no sense. To add insult to injury, the towns are quite bland, with a lack of charm that sometimes verges on sheer ugliness, and the vistas seriously lack variety. And however thought that those unbearably long bridges were an interesting feature deserves a serious spanking.—The random encounter rate is ridiculously high—like, who-the-heck-put-some-Dragon-Quest-in-my-Pokemon-high. This is the first Pokemon entry ever in which I used Repels on a regular basis whilst cruising caves, and I didn't fancy it one bit. Good thing Game Freak came to their senses and implemented a more reasonable rate in X/Y.—The menu is confusing, with not enough categories of items and an interface that's a trifle too figurative to be truly efficient. Also, the default speed of the menu scrolling is ridiculously fast, to the point of becoming a genuine hindrance: I cannot count the number of times I selected the wrong item just because of this overzealous scrolling.—Unova's fauna looks seriously bizarre. Now, I never wanted to partake in the raging debate about the decline of Pokemon design and thus never uttered a single negative comment regarding the looks of 'Mons in my posts; but in the case of Black, I simply cannot help it. An uncanny number of 'Mons in Unova sport a really weird appearance, and things only get worse by the evolution. Many 'Mons become positively grotesque and repulsive in their final form—dare I say monstrous?—and look more like the work of a local Victor Frankenstein than like healthy animals at the peak of their evolution. Sigilyph and Cofagrigus? Ridiculous. Simisage, Simisear and Simipour? Pathetic. Jellycent, Vanilluxe, Druddigon and Hydreigon? My eyes are bleeding. And... Garbodor and Musharna? Excuse me, I have to vomit. More seriously, many 'Mons in Black put me ill as ease, made me cringe or vaguely grossed me out—so much so that I wouldn't be surprised if the backstory of Unova included a nuclear disaster or a bad case of water poisoning. Was Game Freak trying to convey some message about the USA by stuffing Unova with so many freaky 'Mons?—The game's insistence on wifi-based social features is seriously annoying. I don't fancy one bit the fact that the menu was ousted from the touch screen to be replaced by this useless C-Gear app, and being asked whether or not I want to launch the thing before every single plays sessions only added fuel to the fire of my irritation.—Having to fight the Elite Four twice. Are you kidding, game?—Bianca and Cheren are an absolute pain in the behind. They are as genuinely unlikeable as one another, Bianca being the archetype of the dumb clumsy blonde and Cheren the archetype of the obnoxious straight-A student. I hated them from the very moment I laid my eyes on them—which unfortunately happened to be the game's opening scene—and every single one of their interventions made me roll my eyes and grind my teeth. I criticized the transparent rival and bunch of useless sticky kids in X, but Bianca and Cheren are a million times more unbearable. Give me over-excited Barry back, please!Well, that's enough ranting for today. I think I gave Black a vigorous grilling already, so I'll spare you the minute details such as the lack of HM-restricted areas, the extreme pixelisation of 'Mons during fights or the fact that my trainer is sticking out his tush like he's twerking every time he throws a Pokeball. But fear not: there is no Pokemon disaffection on the horizon. I liked Black despite its flaws, and I will certainly pick up Pokemon White sooner or later, as well as White 2 and Black 2.

{"title": "Pokemon Black: The Liepard Solo Run", "date": "26/04/2016", "text": "My Pokemon itch awoke lately and begged to be scratched, and I was more than happy to comply. My gaming instinct elected Pokemon Black as the entry that should be played, and it was not long before I stuffed the cartridge in my DSi and created a brand-new save with a male Trainer that I fittingly named Noir. (For the record, my plan is to pick up the female trainer when I play Pokemon White and call her Blanche. Such a perfect set-up!)I decided right away to indulge in yet another Solo Run, since this is by far my favourite way of playing Pokemon games. The Nuzlocke Challenge can wait a trifle longer! However, my enthusiam was seriously doused by the discovery of the starters, whose bizarre looks didn't please my retinas in the slightest. I finally chose Oshawott, with the secret intention of ditching him as soon as I encountered a more gracious 'Mon. I didn't have to wait long for that fateful encounter: as soon as I set foot on Route 2, I got entangled in a fight with an adorable Purrloin in the tall grass, and there was no turning back. I knew right away that this purple cat would be my One and Only and that we would cruise together all the way to the summits of the Elite Four. Or not—but more on that very soon.The first two Gyms were quite a pain, I have to admit. My Purrloin—affectionately renamed Purry—had only crappy Normal moves at her disposal and struggled in battles, and I needed to grind a fair bit to be able to conquer both Gyms—so much so that I started fearing that maybe that lovely purple feline was not a 'Mon fit for a solo run. Fortunately, the obtention of the  powerful Dark move Pursuit at Lv.15 made things considerably smoother and I started gaining the upper hand in fights, slowly but surely.Eighteen hours and a glorious evolution in Liepard later, I can pretty much one-shot every 'Mon crossing my path, and as usual, it feels amazing. I only had a bit of trouble with Elite Four Trainer Marshal, whose Fighting 'Mons knocked my Purry out more than once; but this unexpected struggle made things all the more thrilling. Then came the fight with Reshiram, which was over so fast that I nearly felt sorry for this poor Legendary. I'm always reluctant to capture these noble beasts, and I wish the games would stop forcing me to do so. It feels so annoyingly trivial and disrespectful to capture these unique 'Mons that are nearly akin to deities, and I cannot help but release them as soon as I can—and Reshiram was no exception. And since I'm mentioning this whole subject, I encountered later a Tornadus on Route 12, which I neatly pummeled into oblivion without being aware that this was a Legendary. I would still have pummeled it into oblivion if I had been aware of its nature, mind you; but I would have done so with more reverence.I am still stationed on Route 12 to this day, and I don't think I will go any further, despite the fact that I technically didn't beat the Elite Four and the Champion. This untimely desertion is solely to blame on the game itself, which had the audacity to force me to fight the Elite Four twice. Such insolence! Infortunately, the first confrontation with the Elite Four was followed by the end of the main story and by the credits, which triggered the usual vertiginous drop in my drive that always prevents me from clearing postgames. Plus, in my mind, I have already beaten the Elite Four as well as an ersatz Champion, so there is basically no need to repeat the whole process. And that's why I've decided to put an end to my glorious Purrloin solo run despite the fact that some towns still stand unexplored and that I've not been crowned Champion yet. I'm quite glad that I could at long last indulge in a feline Pokemon solo run, for such a run has been a dream of mine ever since I discovered the existence of cat-like 'Mons. The only issue is that my Pokemon itch has not been scratched vigorously enough for my taste, which means that I need to play another Pokemon game right away. I'm not too sure yet which version I will elect, but there will definitely be another Pokemon solo run on the heels of my Purrloin one. See you soon for more Pokemon solo action, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Bits and Tidbits: First edition", "date": "25/04/2016", "text": "As you may have guessed already, dear fellow gamers, this is a feature about recent gaming news that clicked with me yet are too minor to deserve a full post. It's still unclear whether this will be an isolated occurrence or a recurring feature—only time and my writing instinct will tell. Without further ado, here are the juicy gaming tidbits that sparked my interest of late!Tidbit#1: Ray Gigant will not have a physical release in the West. To say that I'm disappointed by this turn of events is pretty much an understatement. A slew of Vita first-person dungeon crawlers were granted a physical release on our shores in the last two years, so why not this one? Fortunately, I still have the option of purchasing the Japanese physical version and will very likely do just that sooner or later.Tidbit#2: Stranger of Sword City is going to be granted a limited special edition in North-America. I learnt this after I preordered my own copy, and having missed a special edition of a much-coveted game by just a couple of weeks should have made me absolutely crestfallen; however, much to my surprise, I didn't even feel a pang of regret. The truth is that I didn't care about the existence of this special edition one bit, and the though of purchasing it on top of my normal edition didn't even cross my mind. Heck, I'm not sure I would have deigned to get my paws on it even if I had not preordered the normal edition! That just shows how deeply I'm burnt out on special editions after my recent discomfitures in that field.Tidbit#3: ClaDun Sengoku is going to be released in Japan on the 26th of may. As an avid retro gamer who already owns the first two instalments, I am highly interested by this release and pondering a purcharse—all the more so as if the game is localized, it will probably be under the digital format like its two predecessors.Tidbit#4: After a good four months of delay, the physical limited edition of Summon Night 5 is finally available... to everyone's utter indifference, it seems. The little interest there was in this edition was killed by the delays and the december release of the digital version of the game, and the only gamers elated about this long-awaited release are probably the ones who preordered it months ago. I'm one of them, and my limited physical edition is on its way to my precious collection as I'm typing these lines. Better late than never! (En passant, I'm quite relieved that there was no shortage à la Nintendo and that my preorder could be fulfilled. Kudos to Play-Asia for their great stock management!)Tidbit#5: Since I'm mentioning Summon Night 5, it's worth noting that there are currently no news at all regarding Class of Heroes 3, the other Gajinworks PSP RPG that was slated for a late physical and digital release in the West. It's unclear whether the project has been purely ditched or whether the Gajinworks team is working on it silently, and only time will tell. Given the quiet and delayed release of Summon Night 5, I would wager that the project is not abandoned but will come to fruition with a lot of delay.That's it for my juicy gaming tidbits of the moment, fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},

And yes, this unlikely moment has come to pass, and I'm now offering a digital code for Summon Night 5 to whoever wants to get their paws on it.I got that code along my limited physical edition of Summon Night 5, and said code is virtually useless to me since I own the physical version of the game. So instead of letting that code unused, which is what is bound to happen if it stays in my hands, I'd rather let someone get it and enjoy the game.Beware: this code can only be used on the North-American version of the PSN. The rules are pretty simple: first come, first served. The first person who comments this post to say they want the code will get it. I'm pretty aware that a north-american download code for a PSP RPG lifted from a confidential series is bound to interest but an excruciatingly small number of people, and I don't fancy waiting weeks to get a good batch of comments before performing a draw. I only ask for one thing: tell me in your comment which is your favourite gaming system of all time and why. Just because. I love hearing gaming stories, you know. Without further ado, the code is yours to take, fellow gamer! Be quick to comment!Edit: You're welcome to comment and tell me about your favourite gaming system even if you don't want the code. I love reading gaming stories, I do! The code is still here for the taking, by the way. :)"},
{"title": "Gaming Boxes: Not quite convinced", "date": "20/04/2016", "text": "A gaming box this is. NOT.Gaming boxes are the latest incarnation of the subscription box concept. This 3D, goodie-based version of the good old subscription to a magazine or a newspaper started quite modestly a couple of years ago in the cosmetic field, with inspired start-ups offering so-called \"beauty boxes\" loaded with all sorts of cosmetic items. What could have been a short-lived gimmick proved successful and other business sectors quickly appropriated the concept, leading to a plethora of subscription boxes covering all potential hobbies and interests. I succumbed myself to the lure of boxes by subscribing lately to the Tokyo Treat Box, which centers on Japanese snacks and can nicely feed my never-ending obsession with food.As I was marveling at the current variety of available subscription boxes, a question suddenly popped up in my mind: could there be boxes centered on gaming? An online search was prompt to reveal that such boxes were indeed available on the internet, ready for the subscribing, and I was not far from leaping with joy; however, a deeper examination revealed that these boxes didn't exactly fit my idea of what a gaming-centered box should have been.It's interesting to note that gaming boxes are called \"crates\" instead of \"boxes\", a semantic change that was probably motivated by a desire to distance gaming boxes from their beauty-oriented ancestors and to add a dose of virility to the concept. That's all well and nice, and I'm pretty sure that such a designation will conjure up fantasies of Nathan Drake looting crates in the middle of the jungle in the mind of many a potential buyer, but what matters is the content. And the content is, well... not exactly what I would have expected from something called a \"gaming box\". Or crate.This is the biggest paradox here: these so-called gaming boxes only have the most tenuous link with gaming per se. Upon careful inspection, all of them offer a wide array of various goodies that are not necessarily related to gaming, but rather to a wider geek/nerd/pop culture that is a potpourri of movies, comics, TV shows, books—and occasionally games—and that the average gamer is supposed to know, love and subscribe to—quite literally in that case. The range of goodies offered is leniently large, going from figurines to tee-shirts to mugs to absolutely any item that can be adorned with the logo of a franchise. That universal recipe is then refined with the inclusion of a special touch specific to each box provider, i.e. some unique goodies whose link with gaming is even more impossibly tenuous: candies or manly snacks such as beef jerky and energy drinks, to name only a few.I could digress endlessly on the laughable cliché quality of these boxes, whose curators seem to be unable to imagine a gamer who hates comics, doesn't own a TV and loves nothing more than to sip a good cup of Earl Grey whilst playing games or writing blog posts (a faithful description of yours truly), or on their no less cliché definition of geek/nerd/pop culture, which casts the net far and wide to haul in more potential subscribers. But I will limit my commentary to the biggest bone of contention here: these so-called gaming boxes do NOT revolve around gaming. The items they offer may be well-crafted collectibles for all I know, but they are only marginally tied to gaming—that is, when they are tied to gaming at all. This nearly qualifies as false advertising, or at least as an unfulfilled thematic premise—and promise: these boxes should be renamed \"nerd boxes\" or \"pop culture boxes\" to be true to their contents.Of course, I fully understand that the creation of a genuine \"gaming box\" solely centered on gaming would be pretty much impossible. Such a box would have to contain full-blown games and/or gaming merchandise such as figurines, pouches and the like, all things that are either too expensive, too niche or sold only in Japan. I could imagine a Japanese firm creating a gaming box revolving around famous videogame franchises and consoles and stuffing each box with related goodies, but would the appeal of such a box be wide enough to guarantee its perennity? If the filling choices of all the existing \"gaming boxes\" is any indication, the answer is probably negative. Oh, well.There has thus been no subscription to a gaming box for me, and I will have to make do with my Japanese snacks from Tokyo Treat as my sole box subscription. (Which I highly recommend if you're a Japanese food and/or snack aficionado, en passant.) Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Bravely Default: The end of the road", "date": "19/04/2016", "text": "After 55 hours of grinding, killing bosses and generally doing the same things over and over, I am finally done with Bravely Default. These 55 hours left me deeply sated and happy, with my old-school grindy RPG itch profusely scratched—heck, lacerated would be closer to the truth.I only have praise in store for Bravely Default's gameplay. It blended the harshness and bareness of old-school RPGs with the customizable quality and user-friendliness of modern RPGs, and the result was a pure work of love that offered the better of two worlds and deeply delighted me. I loved Bravely Default from beginning to end and didn't feel a shred of boredom during my playthrough, even when the game forced me to go through its infamous loops during its second half.I also only have praise in store for Bravely Default's soft-hued hand-drawn art style, which is exactly the kind of stylization I want to encounter in video games. Not the soft-hued hand-drawn look per se, mind you; but rather a very distinctive art style that doesn't try to imitate reality. The character's designs were also quite unique and instantly recognizable, cute without being sickeningly kawaii. I was particularly fond of Agnès' round hips and small bosom à la Iggy Azalea; such a figure is quite uncommon in the modern videogame landscape, where thin and long legs and enormous breasts reign supreme, and it was quite refreshing to encounter a character that strayed away from these over-used templates.I only have two minor gripes with Bravely Default's deeply satisfying gameplay. The first one is the overabundance of Jobs, which was thrilling in the early stages yet became counter-productive on the long run. The main issue is actually not the large number of Jobs available per se, but rather the fact that many of these Jobs are too specialized for their own good—and for the player's one. It's pretty obvious that a good third of them have been designed to be used primarily as main Jobs, such as the classic White and Black Mages, Knight, Monk and so on, whilst the remaining two thirds have been designed as side dishes that benefit mostly as secondary Jobs. These \"side dish\" Jobs offer little goodness apart from a couple of specific Abilities and/or Skills and often come along miserable stats, which makes them unfit as main Jobs; to make matters worse, they are often unfit as secondary Jobs as well because they are too excruciatingly specialized. I firmly think that the number of Jobs available should not have exceeded 14-16 and that some pairs of secondary Jobs should have been fused together, such as Thief/Merchant, Spell Fencer/Time Mage, Performer/Pirate, Arcanist/Spiritmaster and Conjurer/Vampire. Some Jobs should not even have been implemented, such as Red Mage and Salve-Maker: the Red Mage is but a remnant of the first Final Fantasy entries and the Salve-Maker is a crappier version of the White Mage who's laughingly useless in battle and whose sole redeeming quality is its cute dedicated outfit. A more trimmed version of the Job system would have spared me the trouble of job-grinding for hours only to discover that a good portion of the Jobs were virtually useless except against very specific enemies.My second gripe is the final boss fight, which I deem an absolute disaster. This final showdown that should have been a summit of epicness was stuffed with an uncanny number of scripted scenes that completely destroyed the tension and diluted the intensity of the whole event beyond repair. The final boss fight should be a fierce head-to-head, a moment when the player is alone with the game without any safety net and can see for themselves at last if their patient grinding is paying off. Such a moment of intense intimacy with the game shouldn't be interrupted by interventions of secondary characters, by annoyingly long scripted scenes, and certainly not by supplications uttered by party members. I mean, supplications in a boss fight? Are you kidding me? We are here to wipe the floor with that boss, not beg him to spare us! All in all, the number of interruptions was so high that I was left yawning by the end of the fight, spamming the same attacks without really caring about winning or not. Had I lost, I would have gone straight to Youtube to watch a video of the ending and wouldn't have given that fight a second try. That's how little I cared about what should have been the game's climax. And that's all your fault, Square Enix, for stuffing cutscenes where they didn't belong. Shame on you.Still, there's no denying that I loved Bravely Default through and through and would wholeheartedly recommend it to old-timers and to gamers who love their grinding on the heavy side. I'm quite enthusiastic about the sequel, which I will play as soon as my old-school grindy RPG itch needs to be scratched again. Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Return to Popolocrois: A case of graphical downgrade", "date": "15/04/2016", "text": "In my last post about the increase of oversimplism in 3DS RPGs and simulation games, I forgot to mention that the involved games also treaded on simplistic territory regarding graphics. As an old-timer who genuinely favours retro gaming, I usually won't blame a game for sporting basic graphics; however, the games belonging to that oversimplistic wave deserve some serious bashing. They do because their graphical simplicity is not born from technical limitations like back in the days, but rather from sheer laziness posing as kid-friendliness. Return to Popolocrois, the newly released crossover between Popolocrois and Story of Seasons, is perhaps the worst offender of the bunch and deserves a serious spanking; for not only are this game's graphics shamefully simplistic, but they also represent a criminal downgrade compared to the ones offered by Popolocrois' previous instalments.RTP takes place in the world introduced by the previous Popolocrois entries; however, said world has been considerably pruned when migrating from the PSP to the 3DS. Pictures are worth a thousand words:The village school in the PSP entryThe exact same village school in RTPThe loss of graphical flourish is painfully obvious. Where are the trees? Why are the roof tiles so much bigger? Why is the general design so much more basic? The same goes for the fighting display, whose 3DS version removes all scenery elements for no good reason:Fighting on a path in front of the town's entranceFighting on... er, a golf course?It's also worth noting that everything has been made bigger in RTP in order to fill up the screen and spare the developers from having to design scenery elements. Concurrently, the overall level of detail has been sharply reduced:Cobblestones. Roof tiles. Bricks. DETAILS!All gone. Also, the number of houses in the village hasbeen divided by three. Who-oo, I can count leaves and grass blades! Jeez, undergrowth and foliage are SO overrated. The fact that the world of Popolocrois had to endure such a graphical downgrade between the PSP entry and the 3DS one is already disappointing enough, but it becomes simply unacceptable when one considers that the oldest entry is more polished than the newest one. I'm not in favour of graphical upgrades from one console generation to the next just for the sake of it, but neither do I fancy the opposite. And no, the fact that RTP may or may not be have been designed with kids in mind is by no means an excuse for such a blatant graphical downgrade: I'm pretty sure that even very young kids can handle abundant foliage and intricate house design, not to mention groves boasting more than five trees and towns hosting more than five houses. This is just laziness, plain and simple.This graphical downgrade saddens me. I played and loved the PSP version of Popolocrois and delighted in its lovely atmosphere and instantly recognizable graphical style—all things I hoped to encounter again in Return to Popolocrois. Alas, a return to Popolocrois this is not—but an exercise in laziness very much indeed. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Oversimplistic much? ", "date": "13/04/2016", "text": "Something is rotten in the state of 3DS RPGs and simulation games.RPGs and simulation games have always been deemed the deepest genres as far as console gaming is concerned. Games belonging to these two genres usually offered a significantly more complex gameplay than other genres flourishing on consoles, and the player picking up such complex games could expect long playthroughs involving considerably more planning and organizing than in, say, your random Sonic or Mario entry. Such games were designed with teenagers or young adults in mind; roaming a fantasy world or pretending to be a farmer was a serious business that required a modicum of maturity, and if kids occasionally dabbled in RPGs or simulation games, they would more often than not find themselves overwhelmed by the complexity of the tasks required by such games. Even a kid-friendly franchise like Pokemon packs a lot of complexity behind its apparent simplicity; case in point, you won't see that many kids hanging around in Pokemon World Championships.However, that delicious complexity of RPG and simulation games, which seemed to be inherent to these two genres and pretty much written in their DNA, has been under attack for the past five years. The battlefield is none other than the 3DS game library, much to my chagrin—I don't want to lambaste Nintendo yet again, especially since I had tons of fun with my 3DS lately; but the facts are undeniable. The 3DS is home to a number of RPGs and simulation games that ditched complexity and depth without a second thought to wallow in much more simple gameplay styles.My first encounter with a game belonging to that new species was when I played Hometown Story two years ago. There was not much to do in that game, and the few tasks available were pretty basic; but it had a nice atmospheric quality that made me love it despite the bareness of the gameplay. I thought it was a nice experiment whose relaxing pace contrasted pleasantly with the hectic schedule promoted by most simulation games. Little did I know that this innocent game was the harbinger of a whole new trend that would hail extreme simplicity as its one and only guideline.Hot on Hometown Story's heels came Fantasy Life, Moco Moco Friends, Animal Crossing: New Leaf and Return to Popolocrois—to name only the ones I've played; I'm pretty sure there are others like them lurking in the 3DS library. These games have one thing in common: they cross the thin line between simplicity and simplism. Instead of offering streamlined gameplays following the \"easy to learn, hard to master\" motto that infuses successful Nintendo RPG franchises such as Zelda and Pokemon, these games are merely content to propose a handful of basic tasks to accomplish in a rudimentary game world. Another most striking characteristic of these games is that they feel like they have been designed solely for kids. Not just kids, mind you: very young kids. Like, 5 or 6 years old at most. This is the first time ever in my gaming life that I've encountered RPGs and simulation games that look and play like genuine developmental toys. And just like any other developmental toy, they are too far below an adult's cognitive abilities to genuinely entertain said adult. Sure, they can be played, and they can even be enjoyable to some extent; but boy, do they make you feel like you're stranded with your children or nephews' toys. Although there has been some RPG series aimed first and foremost at kids prior to the emergence of these games, the idea of an RPG whose gameplay is designed with very young kids in mind is a brand-new concept—a concept that makes little sense from a business point of view. There is a sheer and stark difference between a game that sports a kiddy vibe yet offers a potentially deep and complex gameplay that can be enjoyed by all—such as the main Pokemon entries—and a game that sports a kiddy vibe and offers a simplistic gameplay on par with a kid's abilities. The first will appeal to everyone, the second only to kids; no need to rack one's brain to point out which option is the soundest from a business point of view.Now, one could obviously retort that each audience deserves games tailored for them and that the widening of the videogame spectrum should be celebrated rather than criticised; and I would fully agree with such statements, if not for the fact that the release of these kid-oriented games takes place in a wider trend of oversimplification of gaming. I cannot celebrate the fact that gaming is getting more simplistic, more hand-holdy, more directive and ultimely less interactive by the console generation and that complex and demanding games are slowly but surely becoming the exception rather than the ideal developers strive towards. RPGs and simulation games used to be the last bastion of complexity and depth, the last haven for console gamers craving multi-layered gameplays and long playthroughs; and if these two genres are now infected by the simplism that currently prevails in many other gaming genres, then I fear that it's only a matter on time before we see RPGs on rails and simulation games made only of QTE. Maybe they already exist on home consoles, for all I know.Well, there's no stopping gaming \"progress\", I guess. Maybe I shouldn't worry so much; exigent RPGs and simulation games will very likely endure, if only as a niche genre. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Play in progress: Still going strong (or not)", "date": "11/04/2016", "text": "As far as Bravely Default is concerned, I'm definitely still going strong, with 50 hours of play under my belt and the 7th chapter nearly wrapped up. If my calculations are right, I still have a round of bosses to wipe out and crystals to reawaken before being granted the right to face the final boss and witness the ending, and I'm going to use that last opportunity to prepare myself for the final showdown to the fullest. I yet again tinkered with my party's Jobs since my last post. Edea is still a Templar, but her secondary Job command is now Sword Fencer instead of Valkyrie. This means that she doesn't have a group attack anymore; but since I'm pretty much relying solely on her Desperation skill in battle, the Sword Fencer abilities are a much better complement to her Templar fixed Job command than the Valkyrie ones. I made Tiz a permanent Ranger, because this allowed him to wield a bow that is considerably more powerful than the array of knuckles I currently own. I'm planning to change this soon though, because his defence is painfully weak—not to mention that he looks ridiculous in this furry outfit. I will thus shift him back to Monk and give him the Bow Lore support ability so he can keep on wielding that formidable bow and use the Ranger Skills to great effect. No changes for Agnès, but Ringabel's secondary Job command is now Conjurer instead of Vampire. And talking about Conjurer, this ultimate Job seems tailor-made for epic boss fights, with its MP-replenishing Abilities and buff Skills—all things I'm going to use cleverly in the fights to come. In a nutshell, I'm still sailing smoothly in this ocean of grinding and enjoying the trip just as much as when I first set sail. On the other hand, I've pretty much deserted New Leaf. I didn't touch it since my last post and even went as far as to put the cartridge back in its box, which is an ominous sign that my love story with that game may be truly over. Still, I can't deny that I had a lot of fun playing New Leaf; and should I never touch it again, it will go down in my gaming history as a sweet and light-hearted experience.Regarding gaming news, I lately spotted a couple of interesting titles slated for release in Japan in the months to come. The first one is Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana, which comes in a nice premium box with an stupendous art book. Although my fingers were itching to order the thing, I remembered my underwhelming experience with the special edition of Summon Night 6 and decided to wait for the inevitable Western release of Ys VIII, which will very likely include a similar special edition if Nihon Falcom's track record regarding localizations is any indication. Then comes Genkai Tokki Seven Pirates, the latest release in Compile Heart's Genkai series and yet another monument of fan-service. Although I was not overly impressed by Moe Chronicles, I still loved it enough to make me want to play other games from the series. Also on my list are Kangokuto Mary Skelter, described as an \"active dungeon RPG\"—whatever that is supposed to mean—and Caligula, which has some of the best art I've seen in a while. I'm also curious about The Asterisk War, which seems to be the new Sword Art Online and whose extra-bright colours alone make me want to try it. Of course, it's still unsure whether any of these games save Ys VIII will reach European shores, but it doesn't matter to me as much as it used to: for, lo, and behold, I recently dove back into my long-forsaken Japanese studies. Being able to play Japanese games is thus no longer a distant dream but rather a work in progress, and it feels amazingly good.That's it for the latest news, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Adrift on the gaming sea", "date": "07/04/2016", "text": "Let's face it: most of my gaming life has been an exercise in frustration.My first console was a Gameboy, followed a couple of years later by a Game Gear. Being a portable gamer with a tiny budget in a small European town in the early '90s was like heaven and hell rolled together with a ribbon on top. For every precious game I managed to get my paws on, there were five games that passed me by, either because my funds were insufficient or because the local shops didn't stock them. But every game I did manage to grab was a pure slice of happiness and a purveyor of many excellent hours of gaming; so I pushed through the frustration of not being able to purchase all the games I wanted, pretty confident that adulthood and its corollary increased purchasing power would soon allow me to make all my gaming wishlists come true.Alas, that dream scenario did not come to pass—at least not when I expected it. When I finally took my first steps into the marvelous realm of adulthood and increased budget, the gaming industry had veered toward 3D and was wallowing in blocky polygons and shitty shades of brown. This was a nasty blow to my gaming tastes, which favoured cute sprites and vivid colours; and although I did try my hands at these new gaming trends, they never clicked with me and I never managed to extract the slightest shred of pleasure from the 3D games of that time. The effect on my gaming morale was devastating: just when I was finally able to purchase as many games as I wished, there were no more games to purchase because the whole industry had gone in a direction that I loathed. I tried to compensate by purchasing a Megadrive, but the damage was done: my trust in gaming was broken, and the lack of new Megadrive releases achieved to drive me away from that hobby that had betrayed my expectations. I invested my new adulthood funds in manga and anime and gaming took a back seat, going from my greatest passion to something I would dabble in once in a blue moon. (Or rather once a year: summer was usually the time when I would pick up a controller and do a rerun of oldies, first on my original systems and later on my PC through emulation.)By the mid-noughties, gaming had fallen so far off my radar that the idea of purchasing brand-new gaming systems was unthinkable. I assumed that purchasing consoles and games was a thing of my past and that my gaming present and future were in emulation and occasional bouts of gaming, and I was so sure of it that I virtually stopped following the industry's evolutions for a couple of years. But as the noughties were drawing to a close, lo and behold, my interest in new consoles was piqued again. I don't remember exactly how and why this happened; but one thing leading to another, I finally decided to invest in the Nintendo DS—and the rest is history.Since that fateful moment, I've been immersed in gaming like never before. I bought tons of games to (over)compensate for all my years away from gaming and I luxuriated in this newfound and long-awaited gaming abundance. I still do so nowadays, and I relish every minute of it. This is the first time in my gaming life that the frustration that has followed me ever since I first lay my thumb on a D-pad is totally absent. And boy, does this feel amazing. However, my bright gaming skies have darkened ever-so-slightly of late. The reason for this change of weather is none other than the recent announcements—or lack thereof—regarding the new generation of portable systems. Nothing I've heard so far about the elusive NX makes me excited about it, and Sony's complete silence about a possible successor to the Vita makes me fear that there will be no such successor. I'm thus facing the very real possibility of finding myself once again at odds with the hot gaming trends, stranded with no new console to invest in; and after six years of absolute gaming bliss, I cannot say that I'm elated at such a prospect.However, should I have to face a second gaming exile, I'm much better prepared for it than the first time around. I still have a impossibly long backlog to clear, as well as boxed games that are not going anywhere and will be there for the replaying in the years to come. But most importantly, I now have the certainty, born from experience, that gaming goes through phases and fashions; and if tomorrow's hot gaming trend is not my cup of tea, then maybe the next one will be—or the one after that. In a nutshell, although most of my gaming life has been rife with frustrations—from not being able to purchase coveted games to not liking the gaming fashion of the moment—the last years have been a distinct departure from this whole pattern of gaming unaccomplishment, and I firmly intend to keep basking in that newfound gaming bliss. Whether or not I invest in the next console generation, my gaming career will endure; now that I've clawed my way back into gaming at long last, I'm not leaving any time soon.

{"title": "Bravely Default: A rush of bosses to the head (spoilers!)", "date": "05/04/2016", "text": "Well, I didn't expect that. So you wanna play it that way, game? Well, bring it on; I'm game!Crappy puns aside, I actually did expect the (in)famous plot twist that takes place at the beginning of the fifth chapter. Since I'm too curious for my own good and tend to routinely ignore spoiler alerts, I've known for quite some time that Bravely Default forces the player to replay the main quest four times in a row before finally gracing them with a much-deserved ending. And to be honest, I'm quite glad I knew about that particular structure beforehand, because it allowed me to brace myself for it and get used to the idea. I'm not sure I would have taken these forced reiterated loops so good-naturedly if I had been totally ignorant about the matter—how knows, that may even have compelled me to give up on the game entirely.Although I fully expected these forced loops, I didn't expect them to take the particular form of a boss rush; that, for me, was the real surprise rolled up in chapter 5. I quickly overcame my surprise to rejoice at the prospect of playing that fifth chapter and the ones following, because I happen to love boss rushes. And thus I enthusiastically threw myself into the deed, determined to purge these boss pests from the world map as many times as necessary. This actually feels like a refreshing new start after the trudge I endured in chapter 4. The Eternia arc was a major pain that packed up annoying enemies, a claustrophobic and hard to navigate landscape and a smaller number of exciting Job sidequests than the other arcs. Level-grinding was made tedious by the narrow areas and the resistant foes; and although I managed to raise all my party members' Jobs to Lv. 9 before heading for the Pillar of Light, the task was far from being a walk in the park. Fortunately, this is all over now, and I have the whole world map and dozens of boss fights to level-grind senselessly. Joy and delight! It goes without saying that I'm firmly planning to take down every single boss available, including the complimentary ones related to Job sidequests. I have no idea if this is mandatory and/or if I will reap benefits from it, but a boss rush is a boss rush and I want to leave no stone unturned and no boss unbeaten.Plot twist aside, I'm progressing smoothly and enjoying my run to the fullest. I now have 40 hours of play under my belt and my party members boast a hefty Lv. 70—blame this on the mountain of level-grinding I undertook to raise their Jobs. And talking about Jobs, I've done a bit of reorganizing in the matter: Tiz, Agnès and Ringabel are still Monk, White Mage and Black Mage respectively, but Edea is now a Templar, which is basically a stronger version of the Knight. Their current secondary Job Command are Acrobatics for Edea, Hunting for Tiz, Summoning for Agnès and Vampirism for Ringabel, and the combination of these secondary commands with their fixed Job Commands is quite stellar indeed. I also attributed the \"Absorb P. damage\" Support Ability from the Vampire Job to everyone and it's working miracles in battles—recovering HP when party members endure blows, what more could an RPG player ask for? Lovingly creating my ultimate specialized party through level-grinding and ability-combining is as fun as ever, and I can only hope that the ultimate Job to unearth will bring even more amazing skills.With that, dear fellow gamers, I'll see you in a couple of boss rushes. Brace yourself, you foul bosses, here I come! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Animal Crossing-New Leaf: Day 27", "date": "04/04/2016", "text": "After nearly a month on a steady diet of New Leaf, the cracks are beginning to show.I was truly delighted by the cherry blossom event, which I celebrated by wolfing down a bowl of real-life udon along with an unholy number of sakura-flavoured daifuku mochis and manju cakes; but after witnessing the blooming of these lovely pink blossoms, my interest for the game dropped dramatically. I had been impatiently waiting for that event for a couple of weeks; and now that it is finally there, I have nothing left to look forward to in the immediate future.It certainly doesn't help that I've had a truly hard time finding something gripping to do during my daily play sessions for the last days. I didn't give up on my project to create the ultimate peach orchard, but I'm now questioning the whole purpose of that project. What will I do with these mountains of peaches? Sure, they look pretty and they sell better than the local cherry, but what will I do with the money? After having built two bridges, a fence and a fountain, I'm done with all the public work projects that interested me, and my house is already enormous with its two stories, so I'm not especially looking forward to expanding it again. New pieces of furniture appear very seldom in the local shops, so I can't even indulge in a home decoration spree. My fellow villagers are still fun and quirky, but their babbling is not enough to hold my attention. In a nutshell, I'm bored, and dangerously close to giving up on New Leaf entirely.I guess this untimely boredom is partly related to the way I play New Leaf. I deprived myself from two of the greatest incentives to play that game, i.e. the collecting of insects/works of art/fossils through the Museum and the internet feature that allows players to go social and visit other players' towns. Of course, there was no way I could have proceeded otherwise, since I'm neither a completionist nor a social gamer—which leads me to the conclusion that this game may simply not be the right one for me. Let's face it, there is little in New Leaf that is bound to glue me to my 3DS screen once the thrill of the early stages has evaporated.Don't get me wrong: I totally understand the game's philosophy, and I can even claim that I subscribe to said philosophy. The idea of a game that offers an atmospheric experience in a tiny sandbox game world and treats the player to a daily dose of unexpected little events is an alluring one, and one that is bound to attract me on paper; unfortunately, the translation of this concept in New Leaf doesn't quite satisfy me. There is simply not enough happening on a daily basis to keep me hooked, and the absence of any goal to pursue makes matters worse. New Leaf emulates the real-life feeling of waking up in the morning and wondering what the day will bring—only in a pint-sized world that's considerably less exciting than the real one. If I want to be surprised on a daily basis by unexpected little events, I simply have to get up and go on with my day; I don't need to open my 3DS and mill about in a teeny-tiny and oversimplistic game world. What I expect from a videogame is a goal to pursue and a game world that makes me travel and daydream, all things that are absent from New Leaf.Of course, this may be just a phase; or it may be the surefire sign that I need to play New Leaf a little less frequently. What is certain is that I don't feel like playing the game right now, so I will leave it untouched for a few days and see how things evolve. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Fire Emblem Fates: A change of heart", "date": "01/04/2016", "text": "\"I'm definitely not going to purchase the special edition of Fire Emblem Fates.\"This had been my resolve for a couple of weeks, ever since I learnt that there would indeed be a special edition of the trilogy. I was starting to feel seriously burnt out after having bought a slew of Specials in december and january, and the utter fiasco of the North-American launch of the special edition of Fates further convinced me to avoid the thing entirely. I didn't want to have to deal with shortages, scalpers and ridiculously high prices, and I made a resolution of purchasing Birthright and Conquest only and leave it at that.However, I went through a volte-face a couple of days ago, when it suddenly dawned on me that this special edition of Fates was totally meeting my ultimate criterion for must-have Specials. This criterion is none other than the inclusion of something that is bound to enhance the gameplay and/or add to it, and the special edition of Fates perfectly fits the bill by adding a third game to the initial pair. And since this special edition is also the only planned physical release of said third game Revelations, it would also fully serve the perennity purpose that is so primordial in my collecting.Although I fully saw the wisdom of getting my paws on a special edition of Fates after I experienced that 180, I still felt a modicum of reluctance at the thought of jumping on my keyboard and making a purchase right away. I envisioned the bank account-wrenching prices, the struggle to find an online seller that stocked the thing, and I felt a pang of resentment and anger towards Nintendo for yet again blundering the release of a special edition and making things so hard for collectors. Did they really deserve my money, when they so obviously failed to listen to their customers and meet the demand for that special edition of Fates? After grudgingly mulling over the issue for a little while, I realized that what Nintendo deserved or not was of no interest in that context. What mattered was what I deserved; and as a devoted collector, I fully deserved a copy of that special edition of Fates.With that, my decision was made. I connected to Play-Asia and looked for the now coveted special edition; and lo and behold, they offered the Australian version for $120. This made me stall a trifle, as I was getting tired of forking out huge amounts for Specials. However, a quick calculation revealed that this was actually a fair price, since it amounted to the price of the European versions of the three games bought separately; and considering that the special edition also included feelies, this was really not too far from being a bargain. I still hesitated a little though, and thought about giving myself an extra day to ponder the matter; however, I finally decided against it and purchased Fates on the same day.This was a most inspired decision, because a mere 24 hours later, that much-coveted special edition was out of stock. Just one day later, folks! I cannot believe how incredibly lucky I was to manage to snatch a copy before it was too late, and I will certainly enjoy my special edition of Fates with a lot of gratitude. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Coveted games: Sweet spring blossoms", "date": "31/03/2016", "text": "As spring is slowly but surely taking over, flowers and trees are starting to blossom, and games are doing the same. We have a nice spring release schedule ahead of us, with some long-awaited games finally blooming in Europe and some games popping out of the blue just like precocious flowers. Without further ado, here's my list of coveted games for the Spring 2016!Langrisser Re:Incarnation-Tensei (3DS): I don't know this 25-years-old series at all, so it will be a pleasure to discover it on my 3DS. I'm obviously planning to import a physical copy from North-America, since Europe will once again have to make do with a digital version. Nothing stops a collector from getting their boxed games!Grand Kingdom (Vita): For some reason, this game reminded me immediatly of Grand Knights History on the PSP, and it turned out that the two games were directed by the same developer, a certain Tomohiko Deguchi. This is thus some kind of unofficial sequel, and it's a nice treat to get given that Grand Knights History's planned localization was cancelled a couple of years ago. Gal*Gun: Double Peace (Vita): I'm not yet totally sure that I will invest in that game, but... I am at least curious about it. I'm always ready to expand my gaming horizons and an on-rail shooter sounds like an interesting premise, so maybe I'll cave in and try my hand at it. Rice Digital is offering an exclusive limited edition of the Vita version, but I'll pass on it after my recent lukewarm experiences in that field.Atelier Sophie-The Alchemist of the Mysterious Book (Vita): The Vita will only benefit from a digital release of that game, which is quite a pity. I would have been more than glad to invest in a limited physical edition; but so far, such a plan doesn't seem to be in the pipeline. That's a bit of a shame, really—although I guess we can count ourselves lucky to get that game at all, given the number of publishers that don't even bother localizing their Vita IPs. (I'm looking at you, Squeenix and Sega.)Fire Emblem Conquest/Birthright (3DS): A.k.a. \"Fire Emblem goes Pokemon\". Well, Pokemon-lite inspiration or not, this pair is one of the major 3DS RPG releases slated this year and I'm certainly not going to miss it, especially since we're getting it physical in Europe. Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness (Vita): Here's one of these games that appeared all of a sudden in the Spring 2016 release schedule, seemingly out of nowhere. Well, not exactly out of nowhere in that case: this visual novel used to be an XBox One exclusive and is now ported to the Vita, one year after its initial release. I didn't dig too deep for information, preferring instead to keep the game unspoiled for my future playthrough.  Yo-Kai Watch (3DS): The much-coveted Pokemon clone is finally coming to European shores; and whilst some players have imported and discovered it a long time ago, I preferred to wait for the official European release. I'm curious about this game and series, but not overly excited—which means that I could end up loving it, since low gaming expectations often pave the way for stellar gaming experiences as far as I'm concerned.Zero Time Dilemma (3DS/Vita): My biggest issue regarding the long awaited, rescued-from-the-jaws-of-death Zero series' third instalment is which version I will purchase. I have the first two entries on the DS and 3DS, so it would make sense to buy the 3DS version for the sake of consistency; but on the other hand, the Vita version will certainly look better and may turn out to be more comfortable to play. Oh, well; I still have a couple of weeks to make a decision.That's certainly a solid Spring 2016 wish list—and that's without counting games listed in my last Coveted Games post that are slated for release in the next weeks, such as Stranger of Sword City, Trillion God of Destruction and Odin Sphere. My bank account won't know peace anytime soon, so much is sure! Feel free to let me know about your own coveted games in the comments, dear fellow gamers; and as usual, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Pit (a.k.a. the collector's moment)", "date": "29/03/2016", "text": "To clarify this post's intentionally vague title, let's start with a telling anecdote. Rewind to 1992: the Sega Megadrive is all the rage, and I'm regularly invading my neighbour's house to get my fill of Sonic and Streets of Rage, mourning the fact that my parents refuse to welcome Sega's black beauty in our own home. Fast-forward to 1997: as the Playstation is taking the gaming world by storm, I finally get the opportunity to purchase a Megadrive. Second-hand Megadrives and games are there for the taking for ridiculously low prices, and I indulge in a massive purchasing spree that wouldn't have been possible when the Megadrive was at the top of its game. Fast-forward again to the noughties and further: retrogaming is the new thing and Megadrives cost again as much as brand-new systems, if not more; same goes for the games. Now, see that moment when the prices of Megadrives and games were at their lowest and I could indulge in a giant shopping spree? That, fellow gamers, is what I call The Pit.I coined that term to describe that elusive moment when a console has lost all its value to regular gamers yet has not yet become a object coveted by collectors and retrogamers. The Pit is characterized by both an overabundance of systems for sale—second-hand or brand-new—and incredibly cheap prices—much cheaper than during the system's heyday. As such, it is the perfect moment to purchase games and systems, because purchasing power is increased tenfold. I put together my whole Nintendo DS and PSP collections during these two consoles' Pits, which took place roughly at the same time and are still ongoing, although they are on their last legs. Indeed, how long is The Pit? Although I referred to it as an \"elusive moment\", it can actually last quite long. The Pit always happens at the beginning of a new console generation and its length is directly proportional to the success of the involved system; in other words, the more successful a system is, the longest its Pit will be. The Pit corresponds to the amount of time necessary to sell: a)all the stocks of unsold brand-new consoles and games and b)all unwanted second-hand consoles and games owned by amateur gamers. Once these two sources are depleted, the market for the involved system suddenly dries up and prices skyrocket—hence the image of a pit, stuck between two peaks of high prices. The price rebound marks the moment when collectors that follow the \"investor\" model come out of the woodwork and offer for ludicrous prices the goods they bought a couple of years before, still brand-new and wrapped. But that's another matter that I won't cover here; instead, let's study the Pits of the DS and the PSP.The DS Pit is still ongoing with a relative vigour, although it's starting to show signs of weakness. The rarest DS games are already excruciatingly hard to find, second-hand as well as new, complete or cartridge only. For instance, I purchased a couple of weeks ago a second-hand copy of Shepherd's Crossing 2. This game, which Kina of My RPG Blog described as \"quite cheap on Amazon\" in a 2010 post, is now nearly impossible to find; and when it is, it comes with an insane price tag, such as the $75 of my own copy. Brand-new DSi can still be found quite easily if one is not too picky regarding colours, but good luck with finding a genuine brand-new DS Lite. In other words, whilst the DS' Pit is not over yet, it's very likely closer to its end than to its inception.The PSP Pit, on the other hand, is well and truly over for the most part. I bought a slew of PSPs in 2013 and 2014 for a average price of $130/EUR 100; nowadays, a mere two years later, a brand-new PSP is more likely to cost around $300, all the more so if it comes in a rare colour, and even the \"discount\" PSP Street models command high prices. Popular PSP games that were mass-produced can still be found brand-new for a really cheap price, but most PSP games are becoming increasingly harder to find, be they brand-new or second-hand. Hexyz Force, which I bought complete in late 2014 for $60, now comes with a price tag of at least $90 for the full package and $60 for the UMD alone. The fact that the DS Pit is lasting longer than the PSP Pit blatantly contradicts what common sense would have us believe, i.e. that the less popular system would have the longest Pit. Common sense dictates that if people sniffed at a console during said console's tenure, then surely no one will want to invest in it once it bails out; and yet, the facts show that this is not the case. This leads us to the interesting question of who polishes off unsold inventory and second-hand items during a system's Pit. Although I didn't perform a full statistical study of the matter and certainly won't do so, some purchasing behaviours I've witnessed in myself and others shed light on possible answers. Here are the three main types of potential buyers during Pit periods:Players who missed on the system entirely due to a lack of funds, a lack of time to play, sheer unawareness of the system's existence or any other good reason yet want to discover it and invest in it. These players are likely to buy systems as well as games, sometimes building up full collections for a very decent price. This was my case with the DS: I avoided it during its tenure due to its kiddie image, which made me fear that I wouldn't find any game to my liking. (History has since proven that nothing could be further from the truth, but that's another story.) Players whose console is dying on them yet want to keep playing it, if only occasionally. Those are usually great aficionados of the system who invested in it early on and literally played their console to death, hence the need for a replacement towards the end of the console's lifestyle. These players are more likely to concentrate solely on the console itself, although they may purchase a long-lost game in the process. Players who are also collectors and want to enrich their collection while prices are at their lowest and before the console and its games truly disappears from shelves. These players are also more likely to concentrate on the console itself, scouring Ebay and Amazon in search of juicy bargains. They can buy regular systems with a low price tag that will be used as backups just as willingly as special editions that will become sound investments on the long run. My theory is that this core of lingering aficionados is roughly the same size regardless of how popular the involved system is, which explains why an unpopular system is likely to experience a much shorter Pit than a popular system. This fixed core of aficionados will polish off an unpopular system's unsold inventory and unwanted second-hand items pool faster than a popular system's ones, because an unpopular system is automatically less massively produced than a popular system and will thus offer less unsold inventory and second-hand items ready for the taking during the Pit. QED—well, somehow. The Pit is a pretty fascinating subject, and it becomes even more so when one pores over details. There are a lot of subtleties to be uncovered, such as the fact that a given console's Pit may occur later and/or be longer in some regions than in others, with Japan usually being the last region to experience Pits and retaining stocks of systems and games long after the European and North-American stocks are depleted. The Pit can also affect individual gaming items in a given console generation, generating many parallel Pit trajectories that sometimes don't exactly coincide: a rare game, for instance, may experience its Pit whilst its host console is still soaring and have become a high-priced collector's item by the time said host console hits its own Pit. Last but not least, some gaming items have no Pit at all, experiencing instead a continuous price increase starting from the very day of their release; such are the limited special editions of games and consoles, which are intentionally designed to be rare and see their Pit reduced to nothing because of this planned rarity.The Pit is one of my favourite game collecting-related subject, and I keep studying it by checking and comparing the prices of games and consoles from last generation on a regular basis. My prognosis for the current console generation is that the 3DS will experience a Pit whose length will be comprised between the DS' and the PSP's—it's already fairly difficult to get one's paws on the first regular 3DS models without forking out a ridiculous amount of cash—whilst the Vita will rush through a lightning-fast Pit and go from legacy console to collector's piece overnight. But apart from being a gripping subject, the Pit is first and foremost a conjuncture in which a console's popularity is at its lowest; a conjuncture that happens to be the best moment to purchase games and consoles. The Pit could as well be called \"the collector's moment\": it's a blessed time that allows a game collector to complete—or build up from scratch—their collection by preying on gaming items that have become cheap yet are still abundant. Miss that moment by a few years and you'll find yourself paying high prices for crappy second-hand items, just like I did when I decided to invest in the Gameboy Advance. I won't let that happen again, though: I firmly intend to take advantage of the 3DS' Pit to grab myself a couple of backups, and I'll also make the most of whatever Pit the Vita will go through.

{"title": "Animal Crossing-New Leaf: Day 20", "date": "28/03/2016", "text": "New Leaf has pretty much become part of my gaming regimen now and I'm certainly not thinking of quitting anytime soon. I've perfected and refined my in-game routine, tackling new tasks and relinquishing others. For instance, I all but stopped trips to the Tropical Island; although these visits could be quite productive, they felt too much like farming bouts for my taste. I prefer to stay in my lovely old village, even though the enrichment rate there is considerably lower. My early trips to the Tropical Island were not for naught, though; you could say that they literally bear fruit, since they allowed me to collect a large range of tropical fruits that I could then replant in my own village. These foreign specimens acclimatized pretty well, and my local cherry trees now cohabit with lemon trees, lychee trees and more—not to mention that my shorelines are now adorned with countless coconut trees.And talking about local cherry trees, I've decided a couple of days ago that the peach should hereafter become the local fruit in lieu of the cherry—first because peach is my favourite fruit of all the ones offered by the game, second because peaches look so ripe and full, and third because I'm the mayor and this place is my oyster. I thus started cutting down cherry trees with great enthusiam and replacing them with peach trees, and I already have a nice and productive peach orchard next to my home. That's not to say that I will totally give up on other fruits, mind you: I want peaches to be the prevailing fruit in my village, but I'm still planning to maintain smaller orchards featuring all the other fruits—including cherries.Apart from wreaking havoc on the local flora, I maintain pretty much the same daily routine as any other New Leaf player: I chat with the neighbours and fulfil their demands, I hunt bugs, pick up shells and harvest fruits before selling them, I put some crappy items for sale in the Recycle store and, last but not least, I savour the littles surprises that pop up each day. (For instance, yesterday was the so-called \"Bunny Day\" and involved a giant hunt for chocolate eggs. That was lovely, although I gave up after a couple of minutes because the last three sorts of eggs were too tedious to find.) In a nutshell, I'm enjoying myself. A lot.My only real gripe with New Leaf lies in the fact that it takes so, so very long to accomplish anything in that game. Mind you, I'm not referring to the overall slow pace of the game, i.e. the fact that only one public work project can be tackled at a time, the fact that fruits take a couple of real time-days to regrow or the fact that house improvements can only be witnessed the next day; this is all part of New Leaf's unique style and it's what makes the game so relaxing. What I'm referring to is the fact that even the meanest in-game task takes much longer than it should. I often find myself playing New Leaf for 45 minutes or one hour at a time; and yet, when I close my 3ds, I've hardly accomplished anything more than harvesting some fruits, capturing a couple of insects, excavating a handful of fossils and repaying a meagre fraction of my loans. The return on investment when it comes to gaming satisfaction is clearly not meaty enough for my taste: one hour of gaming should provide me with more tasks to accomplish and a deeper satisfaction than the one I derive from my daily session of New Leaf. As a result, I decided to keep things in check and to play no more than 30 minutes a day; I will accomplish things slower, but that's fine by me. It's not like the game is rushing me forward anyway, now is it?Retaliatory measures aside, I identified a couple of factors that play a huge part in making mundane tasks so unbearably slow. Those are pretty much gameplay tweaks that seem to have been implemented for the sole purpose of lengthening play time, which make New Leaf one of these (too) numerous games rife with fake longevity:The default walking speed is way too slow. I'm constantly pressing B to run, which can become hard on my fingers after a while. The running speed should have been the default speed, period.The talking speed is also unbearably slow, even when using the B or L button to speed it up, and it cannot be altered in the options. Worse, text cannot be skipped at all, which forces the player to endure the villagers introductory speeches every single time they address them. Not to mention that constantly pressing the L or B button when talking to people can be tiring. The inventory's capacity is painfully limited, which forces the player to take a lot of extra trips during the harvesting and selling processes. The overall speed of everything is painfully indolent. My character moves around slowly, picks up items from the ground slowly, digs slowly, fishes slowly and so on, as though they have all the time in the world. Well, maybe they do, but I do not. Villagers who want to invite you to their places or visit yours always want to do so at least one hour later. Why not just five minutes later, damnit? I have more important things to do than mill about for one hour or reopen my 3ds just to rendezvous with digital animals.I cannot help but think that New Leaf would be so much more fulfiling if only it played three times faster. Why this languor, anyway? Did Nintendo think players would be all stressed out if their mayoral self moved faster or if text could be skipped? Or is it a classic case of a conscious design to make play sessions drag on unduly and inflate the overall gameplay time, giving birth to impossibly long playthroughs? Whatever the reason, this display of fake longevity spoils my experience ever-so-slightly and could well be one of my main reasons to give up on the game in a distant future. But we're not there yet; for now, I'm still enjoying the game and I want to indulge in it for a little while longer. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's delight: Of summer, swimsuits & showdowns", "date": "26/03/2016", "text": "Although DOAX3 and its lush special editions are all the rage now, I chose to focus on another game packed with summery settings and revealing swimsuits. That game is none other than Senran Kagura: Estival Versus, a game so heavy on estival aesthetics that gazing at the box alone makes me wish summer were already there. We're talking more specifically about the Millennium Festival edition, known as the Endless Summer edition in North-America. These two Specials pack up exactly the same goodies, the only difference being the outer box; and I have to admit that for once, Europe got the best version. Look at the beauty Marvelous bestowed upon us!This gorgeous box bursting with bright colours and featuring all the characters is not as enormous as the one hosting the Deluxe Edition of Bravely Second, but it's not too far off the mark. We're talking about a 24 x 34 x 5cm box, which is still much larger than a book and makes that special edition cumbersome to store in regular shelves or pantries. A teeny-weeny bit galling, especially knowing that most of that space is occupied by the cardboard structure hosting the feelies. And since I'm mentioning the feelies, here they are in all their colourful glory:We have a double-CD bursting with tracks, an art book, some postcards and last but not least, the game itself. The art book contains lovely illustrations along with detailed descriptions of all the characters' background, which is quite enjoyable. I only regret that Marvelous didn't include strategy advices like they did in the \"Let's get Physical\" edition of Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus. Oh, well.All in all, this is a gorgeous special edition and an excellent deal to boot, given that the game alone costs roughly the same price. Of course, one had to be an early bird to get their paws on this special, since Marvelous used again the system of preoders and print-on-demand that had proven so successful with Senran Kagura 2. I love them more and more for not giving up on physical format when the whole industry is trying to make digital distribution the norm, and for crafting beautiful special editions to boot. I can feel all their love and passion for the game in that vibrant box, and I will most certainly buy more lovingly designed Specials for them. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Bravely Default: Bravely is the new Fantasy", "date": "25/03/2016", "text": "The recent reception of my Deluxe Edition of Bravely Second reminded me that I had yet to play the serie's first instalment, which I bought a good two years ago yet never touched. Classic story, shall we say; the same could be told about most of my game collection. But I digress; the important point here is that my gaming instinct commanded me to pick up Bravely Default and discover the series for myself at long last.I would nearly be tempted to write \"rediscover\", because Bravely Default bears an uncanny resemblance to a game I played two years ago. More than a mere resemblance, in fact. For, lo and behold, Bravely Default is basically Final Fantasy I with revamped graphics, a slighty more fleshed-out story, an inflated job system and an avalanche of gameplay tweaks designed to erase all trace of old-school clunkiness. But I'm not fooled by all this flashiness, oh no precious: under the modern coating, this is old-fashioned Final Fantasy through and through. Here's a convenient list of all the similarities I've spotted so far:The design of the game world is similar to the one found in FFI, with a roamable world map full of areas that can be explored yet serve no purpose and empty dungeons devoid of puzzles.  Crystal-based narrative, Phoenix Downs and spells that have exactly the same names and effects as the ones encountered in FFI: the whole Final Fantasy grammar is there allright. The job system is there too and shamelessly reprises some of FFI's jobs: Knight, Thief, Monk and the good old White/Black/Red Mage trio. Last but not least, Bravely Default has a certain dryness to it, just like its venerable model. This is a game that's rather light on the narrative side yet offers millions of excellent reasons to grind senselessly. All things considered, it actually offers little more than metric tons of grinding. The story is not gripping enough to provide a reason to play the game and often consists in detours and meanderings that are only pretexts for more grinding. The sidequests only lead to the acquisitions of new Jobs, which then lead to even more grinding. And the rest... Well, the rest is just grinding, period.Which is just so, so totally fine by me. I love heavily grindy RPGs as a rule and I have a taste for simple and straightforward gameplay styles: since Bravely Default fits both bills, I'm absolutely lapping it up. Gorging on it would probably be closer to the truth: I enthusiastically play it for hours on end, and I'm more likely to stop my daily session of play because my 3ds' battery is dying on me than because I'm bored of the game. And since I'm mentioning my daily sessions of play, let's expand a bit on my run, shall we?I've played 17 hours so far and just started the Eisenberg arc. My party members' Jobs are pretty much fixed now, with Edea as a Knight, Tiz as a Monk, Agnès as a White Mage and Ringabel as a Black Mage; these Jobs fit them perfectly and they all perform really well in their respective roles. I've gotten 13 of the 24 Jobs available and I'm enjoying myself immensely with all the possible combinations of Job Commands and Support Abilities—so much so that I'm currently in the middle of a grinding marathon in order to raise every single Job to Lv.6 for all my party members. There's something curiously intoxicating in the though of directing a bunch of over-powered characters mastering every single competence offered by the game; that very though had been a driving force in my legendary solo run of Dragon Quest IX, compelling me to play beyond reason, and it is very much a driving force as well in my run of Bravely Default. Last but not least, I'm playing on Easy mode. That makes nearly all battles a piece of cake, and I'm regretting that a trifle; however, the Normal mode is just too, well... hard. It makes even the meanest random battle last forever, and it's simply unacceptable in such a grindy game. A difficulty rate halfway between Easy and Normal would have been pitch-perfect, but it's not available. Oh, well. Bravely Default is so deliciously player-friendly that I'm not complaining in earnest. Take the random encounter meter, for instance: isn't that the most perfect tool ever to grind senselessly? Crank it up to 100%, and voilà! Random battles every two steps for your convenience! So much more practical than the old random item that raises random encounter rate for a while only. And the flexible and customizable Job system is both really simple to grasp and incredibly fulfilling—more so than any Job system I've ever encountered in an RPG, including the one in DQIX. And let's not even talk about the adjustable speed in combat and the possibility to wrap up random battles neatly and quickly by spamming the Brave command and stacking up turns, which are absolute blessings that nearly made me tear up when I discovered them. You get the idea now: I totally adore that game and I feast on it on a daily basis. It's old-school Final Fantasy brought to a new generation of players; and when I say that, I'm including myself in said new generation. I never had an attachment to the Final Fantasy series because I virtually missed all its entries, and playing them years—or decades—later cannot arouse the kind of genuine affection a gamer can feel for a series they've discovered and played from its inception. But with Bravely Default, I can finally have my own Final Fantasy: my own legendary series that sums up and encompasses the very essence of turn-based old-school RPG goodness. Here's to many more Bravely entries to come! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's delight: So much more than just art", "date": "23/03/2016", "text": "I mentioned in my ultimate post about Legend of Legacy that I had ordered the game's official art book, just for the sake of diving deeper into that game world that enthralled me so very much. I received the book a mere couple of days after receiving the special edition of Summon Night 6, and it went a long way toward alleviating the disappointment generated by said special edition. I got much more than I bargained for in purchasing that book, and it was worth many special editions I've purchased lately. See that beauty for yourselves, fellow gamers:The colours are splendid, and the art is no less: Kobayashi Tomomi, of SaGa fame, did an absolutely stellar job there. The character designs are stunningly gorgeous and make them look so much more impressive and charismatic than in the game, where they are little more than cookie-cutter 3D models:The beauty! The elegance! Such a display of resplendence would have been enough to sate me, since I bought this art book solely to gaze at gorgeous pictures related to the game; but to my utter surprise and delight, there was more in store for me. See, this art book is actually supposed to be the game's \"official graphical guide\", as the cover states; and I quickly discovered that this somewhat vague designation actually means that the book is a strategy guide with some art included. In other words, my absolute dream idea of what an art book related to a game should be.Look at this! Detailed maps, replete with annotations! And that's only a fraction of the book's content: from spells to items to stances to fighting strategies, it covers every aspect of the game, with tons of text, data tables and pictures. It's a splendid book that contains all the data a Legend of Legacy aficionado could dream of, along with a copious amount of eye-candy. The art and the game designs—main characters, foes, places and the like—occupy a good third of the book whilst the strategy guide occupies the last two thirds. That's just the perfect balance, if you ask me.It goes without saying that I wholeheartedly recommend these 255 pages of splendour to any Legend of Legacy aficionado who wants to invest in a book related to the game. Just like its source material, this art book is a true work of love, and it shows beautifully. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's delight: Style over substance", "date": "22/03/2016", "text": "First and foremost, here's a disclaimer: this was totally an impulse purchase. There was not a shred of rationality involved there: the rational decision would have been to wait for an hypothetical Western release of Summon Night 6—or for the confirmation that there would be no such release—before purchasing a Japanese copy of that game. This is a textbook occurrence of a purchase solely motivated by a \"special\" coating and not by the game itself.If this sounds like some sort of self-flagellation, that's because it is. And it is so because I've been fooled; fooled by a \"special\" that promised more than it delivered. This 15th Anniversary Edition of Summon Night 6 is all style over substance: it's flashy, it's gorgeous, but it's ultimately empty and vapid. Before I explain why, let's take a look at the package:Pretty, right? Gorgeous picture, lovely colours and a huge, thick box in A4 format crammed with items:\"Crammed with items\" is the right way to put it, indeed; because once these feelies are out, it's excruciatingly difficult to put them back where they belong. The outer box is a teeny-weeny bit too tight, despite its respectable size; but that's the lesser problem here. The biggest issue is that tantalizing art book, which turned out to be nothing more than a compendium of all the character designs of the six Summon Night games. That, and nothing more. Not only is this the laziest way to fill an art book I've ever seen, but it's also utterly pointless: chances are high that the players ready to invest in this edition are aficionados of the series, who already know the games and their characters inside out and don't need their memory to be refreshed by an art book. To add insult to injury, the designs utterly lack charm and are not especially pleasant to look at—although this is a matter of taste, I guess.This special edition, along a couple of others I've purchased lately, has made me a trifle suspicious of special editions in general. I've come to understand that the presence of an art book is by no means a guarantee of interesting content, and I'm going to refrain from blindly purchasing \"specials\"  containing art books from now on. Once bitten, twice shy! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's delight: A true collector piece", "date": "21/03/2016", "text": "Let's face it: although they are usually highly coveted, most special editions of games are far from being true collector's pieces. They often consist in little more than a couple of randoms items slapped together in a crappy cardboard box adorned with garish colours; not exactly the kind of valuable one would like to expose on a shelf, at least not outside of a dedicated gaming room. The Deluxe Edition of Bravely Second, however, breaks that mold and positions itself as a genuine work of art, a classy and stylish package that a game collector may want to proudly display to everyone's eyes. Mind you, this game collector may not really have another choice.It doesn't quite show on that picture, but that beast is absolutely HUGE. 30 x 38 x 8 cm, to be exact, and a hefty 1,9 kg on the scale. This is by far the most enormous special edition of a game I've ever seen, so enormous that it's nearly ridiculous. Obviously, this monster doesn't fit in any of my shelves, let alone in a pantry; so I've had no other choice but to put it on top of a bookcase. There it sits proudly, displaying its black soberness to everyone's eyes.Upon opening comes a first layer containing the game, a soundtrack CD and the mini-figurine of Agnès, along that gorgeous picture adorning the inside of the lid. That first layer can be removed to reveal the art book:It's worth noting that despite its respectable size, this art book contains no text apart from the captions accompanying each picture. I guess you cannot really blame an art book for being exactly that, i.e. a book full of art; but still, given the size of this particular book, I expected to come across at least a couple of interviews or explanatory texts regarding the game's conception. Oh, well. This art book remains a masterpiece, full of gorgeous pictures covering every aspect of the game.Last but not least comes the mini-figurine of Agnès:I don't care one bit about figurines, but I have to admit that this one is truly lovely. It is rather well-finished and faithful to the character's design—unlike the one included in the Collector Edition of Bravely Default, which was infamous for its ugliness and lack of polish. I certainly won't display that adorable piece of plastic anywhere, but it feels like a valuable addition to that special edition.All in all, I'm quite satisfied of that purchase. It feels good to own a \"special\" that looks and feels like a genuine work of art, with love and care involved in its conception, and not like a half-baked attempt at cashing in by exploiting game collectors' purchasing impulses. Now I still have to like the game, but I'm none too worried about this, given that... Well, more on that later! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Animal Crossing-New Leaf: The importance of sound foundations", "date": "16/03/2016", "text": "This post could as well have been titled \"the importance of town layout\" or \"the importance of fellow villagers\" or \"the importance of local fruits\", because all these things are paramount factors in the success of a playthrough of New Leaf. For yours truly, at least.Although my lovely little village is barely eight days old, I've actually been playing the game for twice as long. I picked it up on the 28th of february and started a playthrough with much enthusiasm, eager to discover at long last that game that is so widely branded as one of the most addictive simulation games ever created, spawning impossibly long playthroughs in its wake. Unfortunately, the magic didn't quite work on me. After eight days of plodding and yawning, I had to face the horrible truth: I was not enjoying the ride. My town layout made me feel claustrophobic, my fellow villagers were boring and looked weird, and the whole thing was more akin to an overstretched snoozefest than to an rollercoaster of addiction. So much for the year-long playthrough I had fantasized about, did I sigh whilst popping the cartridge out of my 3ds.However, as I was about to put said cartridge back into its box, I changed my mind and decided to give the game a second chance. Everybody deserves a second chance, especially games that have been purchased with cold hard cash; and so I stuck the cartridge back in my 3ds, determined to start all over on sounder foundations. I chose a different town layout more to my liking, which led me to discover that my fellow villagers were actually chosen at random, just like the town's local variety of fruit. I ended up with trees loaded with cherries in lieu of oranges and with a batch of quirky and zesty villagers much more interesting than the ones populating my first village. From snobby sheep Willow to whimsical Cat Moe, without forgetting Ricky, the ever-frowning, pint-sized squirrel who was kind enough to offer me a plump peach on my second day on mayoral duty, they are all a pleasure to look at and interact with. Not to mention Isabelle, who is nearly too adorable to handle. This new village gave me an immediate feeling of cosiness that the first one had not managed to arouse; and with that, I knew that I was on safe ground and ready to roll.That's not to say that I expect to spend years playing New Leaf like some dedicated players did, but I can certainly see myself playing it for some time and getting a lot of enjoyment out of it. I've been playing daily for the last eight days and I really delight in the soothing gameplay and the mellow, nearly mundane atmosphere. I'm very much a routine person, and the idea of getting a small dose of New Leaf every single day for a while is a very pleasant idea indeed. I found out that I enjoy the game more if I play it for short periods of time, and the real-time feature and overall slow pace definitely encourage an incremental way of playing rather than a greedy one in which the player gorges on hours of play at once.I've also found out what I will indulge in and what I will gladly skip—at least for the time being. Growing different types of fruits is definitely a goal I want to achieve, as well as making my town as leafy as possible by cramming it with trees. Since I'm mentioning trees, I've stopped shaking those that bear no fruits: although it can sometimes yield interesting items, it's definitely too tedious for my taste. Just like my ultimate bane in that game, which is none other than donating items to the Museum. Not only is the process unbearably tedious, forcing the player to first assess and then donate the items, but that whole concept is totally at odds with my non-completist mindset. It reminds me of these Panini sticker albums I tried—and unvariably failed—to fill up when I was a kid, and I can already envision how things will evolve: there will be some super-rare fossils/insects/whatever that will be a royal pain to obtain, leading only to frustration and disappointment. I'd rather skip the whole thing entirely and spare myself that pain; and if my village grows to be a lair of uneducated louts, then be it. At least we'll have full bellies thanks to all the fruits I will grow. Food is life! As a whole, my goal is to luxuriate in New Leaf's mellow atmosphere, to enjoy the little novelties that pop up every day and to indulge in whatever I feel like doing during my daily playing session. Only time will tell where this will lead me, and I'm quite curious to see—and play—it for myself.I'll keep you posted about my New Leaf adventure, fellow gamers. I'd be curious to know if you experienced a similar disaffection with your first town(s) and curious to know any interesting anecdotes about your own playthroughs, so feel free to expand on the matter in the comments! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Legend of Legacy: All good things come to an end (spoilers!)", "date": "14/03/2016", "text": "Including great games. After 34 hours of roaming, fighting and looting, my run of Legend of Legacy is over. And you know what? I'm sad. I feel some bittersweet ache at the thought that my fascinating, entrancing, deeply fulfilling run of that game is over. I could have gone on for yet another thirty hours, discovering new dungeons and drinking in the game's unique atmosphere.Why the drama, you may ask? Surely you can indulge in postgame, or roam again old dungeons if you want your run to be longer, right? Well, actually, no. Not only is there no postgame at all in LoL, but the game literally forbids you to roam Avalon again once the final boss is beaten. I found myself in Initius after the deed was done, with no possibility to save or alter my party—which was actually disbanded, my former mates walking amongst the locals and commenting on the fact that our adventure together was a hell of a good one and that we should do that again someday. I then left Initius, which triggered the credits; and after witnessing lead character Garnet's final scene, I was sent back to the beginning of the game and given the possibility to start a New Game+ right away. I obviously didn't do so, since I was still busy digesting the whole experience and trying to come to terms with the fact that my run was over.Although I had been playing for 34 hours already, I didn't expect the ending to come so soon, so to speak. The game's non-linear brand of dungeon-crawling means that there was no ominous build-up to the final showdown, and the last boss came nearly out of the blue. Although there was no mistaking that grandiose fight for anything else than the Final Boss Fight, it was still a bit of a surprise to see the game come to an end right after that—especially since the ending does not exactly shed light on the island's many mysteries. I suspect the storyline to be a choral one, in which it is necessary to clear the game with all the characters to get the full picture; and I suspect that full picture to be quite a blurry one anyway, with many elements being left to the player's imagination. At any rate, the combination of that cryptic storyline and that old-school ending that puts a full stop to the game instead of being a mere pre-postgame intermission gives me the odd, persistant and wondrous feeling that my playthrough has been an incursion into a dream of sorts.Whether this effect was voluntarily crafted by the developers or not, it is one of my favourite aspects of LoL. Never before have I played a game that made me feel so much like I was exploring a mysterious and ultimately unfathomable world, with just a handful of cryptic clues to help me figure things out—or not. My gaming fernweh came back full force, to the point where I did something that I usually never do, i.e. purchase the official art book in order to soak myself deeper in that marvelous game world. Those gorgeous dungeons are engraved in my memory now, and I want to roam them again and try to figure out Avalon's many mysteries. No, take that back: I don't need to figure out Avalon's many mysteries. I want to dive into that world again just for the sheer pleasure of it, just because it feels so tangible yet so surreal, solemn and timeless, just because it makes me feel like a full-fledged explorer trying to piece out a mystery that's beyond their understanding.I realize that all my writing about Legend of Legacy is a trifle messy and quite emotional; and that's not too surprising, considering that it mirrors my experience of the game. I don't want to expand on the gameplay mechanics because I don't really care about them, at least not outside of the game's context. They are only a tool to a greater purpose, which is the roaming of that marvellous game world. I don't want to try to be rational about Legend of Legacy and to analyse it, because playing that game was a deeply emotional experience for me. It sent me back to a place I thought I had left forever, namely the early stages of my gaming career, where every cartridge held a promise of adventure and even the most barren game world was a place of wonders. I love Legend of Legacy for that. I love it for offering me a vast and tangled game world while refraining from any kind of hand-holding, giving me the pleasure of making discoveries and overcoming obstacles on my own. I love it for being so tough and so gorgeous at once, making me feel again like a kid taking their first steps into the wondrous world of videogaming. I love that game, and I'll play it again for sure—and I sure encourage you to do so as well, dear fellow gamers. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Legend of Legacy: The importance of guarding well", "date": "08/03/2016", "text": "Amongst many other things, that is. There are so many interesting elements to discover in that game that I feel like I've barely brushed the surface of that pool of knowledge despite having been playing for a good 26 hours now. Legend of Legacy is getting deeper by the hour—and the boss fight—and I feel like I could never get enough of it. How exciting!Guarding has been the key to both my progression and my fighting style so far. After I finally got my two Specials and equipped my lead character Garnet with them, it turned out that this purchase was not enough to turn the tables and allow me to gain the upper hand in fights. In utter desperation, I decided to experiment with formations. The Pegasus formation available from the get-go had never functioned well with my characters, because Owen was alloted the Guard stance by default yet was not sturdy enough to guard efficiently. But, lo and behold, I discovered at that fated moment that stances could be changed at will. Oh, the joy! I put Garnet on Guard duty and immediately noted a staggering change for the better. Since Garnet had the best guard stats at that point, along with the best equipment, she did a much better job at guarding than Owen and I could progress efficiently at long last, taking down powerful bosses along the way. The difficulty spike present at the beginning of more or less every single dungeon was not a problem anymore, which allowed me to explore more and to figure out what I was suppose to do, i.e. (spoiler) get the three Singing Shards and reactivate the three elemental temples to open up a whole new stretch of land bristling with new dungeons to explore. (End of spoiler)Since then, everything has been going fine and dandy. Meurs and Owen have learnt powerful attacks that can target several foes at once, which is incredibly convenient to wrap up fights quickly, and the whole crew has been gaining SP, HP and stats with a pleasant regularity. Garnet has become the ultimate Guard master, with the unavoidable consequence that her attacking abilities took a step back. She hits quite weakly compared to her foils, but I'm planning to leave things that way and to keep concentrating on her guarding skills first and foremost. It's quite a pleasure to patiently build up my team and to see it become more and more efficient and specialized by the dungeon.I'm still far from being done with team-building, mind you. I've not touched elemental abilities so far, and the Whispering Shards have remained safely tucked away in my inventory. I was actually not planning to touch them at all, since my tweaked Pegasus formation was working so fine, but I've encountered a formidable foe that is going to require a fair bit of elemental action. This foe is none other than the Green Dragon standing at the bottom of the Bogsaur Marsh; and if forum topics regarding this beast are to be believed, he is a Mont Blanc-sized difficulty spike in its own right. Fair enough; after beating every single complimentary boss offered by the game, I needed a bit of a challenge to spice things up. Bring it on, game! My next goal is to gain and level up elemental abilities and to devise a winning strategy to take down this cursed Green Dragon. I managed to beat all the other bosses of the game to a pulp, even the ones that seemed impossible to beat at first sight—and fight—so there is no reason things will turn out differently for this one. I'll see you after a couple of hours of grinding, fellow gamers! In the meantime, I can expand on more general matters about the game. I'm really delighted with the importance given to strategies and carefully laid out party building in Legend of Legacy. Brute level-grinding and powerful equipment can only take you so far, and that won't be very far indeed. Substantials stats increases as well as brand-new abilities can only be gained when fighting enemies with levels similar or superior to the ones boasted by your crew, so levelling up by fighting weak foes in the first dungeons is definitely not an option to overcome the game's numerous difficulty spikes. It is crucial to find a fighting formation that works for you and to reinforce it by focused level-grinding—all the more so are there are only three party members, which means that they have to be both specialized and versatile. The level of party customization is absolutely perfect, with just the right number of options available to make one want to experiment with weapons, stances and party combinations without feeling overwhelmed. With some clever level-grinding, i.e. against foes with similar or superior levels, gaining new abilities and stats increases fast and efficiently is a piece of cake. En passant, I regret the fact that weak enemies were not granted a fleeing behaviour: they throw themselves at me even when they are obviously too weak to beat my crew, and since it's impossible to flee battles without being sent back to the beginning of the dungeon, I have to wrap up these fights even though it's pretty obvious that I won't gain any stats increase or items from them. Although it gives me the opportunity to luxuriate in my hard-earned superiority over foes that used to tower over me, it's also a huge time-sinker when I want to roam old dungeons, and I could have done without this hindrance. Oh, well. There is still much more I want to say about Legend of Legacy, but I'm depleted my writing mojo for the day. See you thus in a couple of days, dear fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Legend of Legacy: Finding my stride", "date": "01/03/2016", "text": "Here is the game I have been pining for for ages: a good, meaty, addictive 3ds RPG. An RPG that would glue me to my 3ds screen for hours on end, until my wrists and thumbs cry for mercy. I'm been waiting for it, praying for it, and it came at long last. Joy and glory!Mind you, that nearly miraculous gaming love story may well not have existed at all. A couple of hours ago, I was on the verge of quitting the game entirely before writing a scathing rant about it. The main issue was that I couldn't figure out the game's mechanics and thus couldn't find my footing, let alone my stride. I was totally lost at sea, exploring dungeons at random without making any discernible progress and finding myself overpowered by enemies on a regular basis. I didn't know what I was supposed to do, let alone how to do it, and playing Legend of Legacy was a confusing mess of a gameplay experience that I was very much inclined to cut short—along with my suffering.What saved my run was a decision I made after a couple of hours of infructuous trudging and plodding, namely to gather enough money to purchase the two \"Specials\" available in the village's shop. We're talking about a sword and an armour, both powerful enough to give me the hope that I could gain an edge on foes at long last. Little did I know that gaining the upper hand during fights is actually a much more complicated business that requires more than overpowered gear; however, farming money for the purchase of the Specials allowed me to figure out the game's cryptic rules a lot better, along with giving me a objective to focus on and pursue. After I finally managed to get my hands on these much-coveted Specials, things started falling into place, slowly but surely. I figured out what I was supposed to accomplish in dungeons and how to gain the upper hand in fights, and I started making some very visible progress at long last. Now, after 16 hours of play, I can safely that I have gained a solid footing, and I can now make the game my own and play it my way. Better late than never, indeed.Still, the fact that it took me more than ten hours to gain a decent knowledge of the game's rules and be able to feel at ease playing it is quite telling. It's extremely easy to write off LoL as a confusing, messy and ultimately lazy game that has little to offer beyond headaches and frustration. The game is much deeper than it seems at first sight, but it takes an awful lot of time to uncover that depth, due to cryptic rules and a non-linear progression that makes for unnecessary meanderings. I don't remember having struggled that much just to gain a basic mastery of a game's rules since... well, Final Fantasy Legend 2.This uncanny similarity shouldn't come as a surprise, since LoL was conceived from the get-go as a \"spiritual sequel\" to the SaGa series. And boy, does it fit the bill perfectly. LoL is just as hard and cryptic as FFL2, and just as rewarding when obstacles are overcome at long last. I'd like to expand profusely on LoL's crypticness and toughness, but there is so much to say that I will rather leave these matters for future posts. For now, an overview of the game will suffice to conclude this post on a nice informative touch. One particular point I've not come accross so often in reviews regarding the game is its exact nature. Although it has been heavily marketed as a classic J-RPG, it is actually a pure dungeon-crawler. It present all the staples of the genre: single village acting as a restorative hub, world map with dungeon locations that can be accessed instantly, auto-drawing maps of the dungeons and last but not least, a skeletal story that is nothing more than a pretense to roam the vast and untamed game world. The game's peculiar style of crawling takes a while to get used to: instead of going for classic geometric dungeon design with straight lines, square rooms and right angles, LoL favours a more naturalistic approach that involves relief variations, hazards such as geysers or exploding cacti and all sorts of impediments linked to the nature of the terrain—without forgetting a lot of purely visual hindrances. It's an all too common occurrence to bump into an foe that was hidden behind trees or to have an flight attempt ruined by a hindering rock or bush. Still, this naturalistic brand of dungeon design offers an nice and refreshing alternative to geometric dungeons; I certainly have less trouble believing that I'm exploring vast expanses of uncharted wilderness in LoL than in, say, Gates to Infinity. LoL's brand of dungeon-crawling is also pleasantly non-linear, with several dungeons being available at the same time as a rule and many incentives to roam again previously explored dungeons—be they complimentary, like optional bosses, or mandatory, like the necessity to revisit some dungeons with newly gained items in order to progress further. That's it for this introduction to Legend of Legacy, dear fellow gamers. See you soon with more meaty posts about that great game! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Trails in the Sky: A love letter", "date": "25/02/2016", "text": "I just finished Trails in the Sky, and I'm both sad and elated. Sad because that amazing game is over, and elated because I relished every single minute of the 45 hours I spent playing it. Now I can scream it out loud: I ADORED that game. I adored it so much that I want to play every Legend of Heroes entry as well as every Nihon Falcom game ever released. Now that's a nice mission to appoint myself, yes precious.The fact that I loved Trails in the Sky so much is still a bit of a mystery to me, to be honest. By all accounts, I should have hated it: story-driven RPGs are not my forte, and I usually tend to experience some serious storyline fatigue around the 25 hours-mark. So how come I could keep going for 45 hours and still want more when all was said and done? Well, maybe because Trails in the Sky is not really a story-driven RPG after all, at least not in the modern acception of the word. The game's approach to all things narrative is pretty much an old-fashioned one: the story is here to provide milestones and general directions but doesn't push the player around like cattle. There are ample amounts of freedom to be enjoyed and vast expanses of land to be roamed at one's own pace, be it to fulfill sidequests or just for the sheer pleasure of it. I would be tempted to describe Trails in the Sky as an atmospheric RPG rather than a story-driven one: it is a game in which gratification is derived from immersing oneself in the game world and letting the whole atmosphere soak in. The story is but a mere detail here—all the more so as it's entirely told in medias res, with characters constantly referring to past events and elements of the game world's mythology as though they're common knowledge. The player is basically expected to jump on board, take the settings in and enjoy the trip to the fullest—which I certainly did. And talking about jumping on board and trips, I certainly didn't expect the title to actually refer to airliners and the trails they leave in the sky. Isn't that a bit... mundane? Oh, well. It's still evocative enough, I guess, and no one prevents me from reading figurative meanings as well in this title.  The last 30 hours of my playthrough were just as good as the first 15, maybe even better. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the core of my party was made of Estelle and Joshua up until the very end; I loved this arrangement from the get-go and half-feared that the game would force me to go full party as some point, but these fears were unfounded. I also lapped up the grindy crawl in the last dungeon, which was a nice and unexpected bite of classic dungeon crawling. By that time, I had discovered the ultimate trick to wrap up boss fights quickly, namely to fill up everyone's S-Break gauge before the fight and to start said fight by unleashing a slew of devastating S-Break attacks that allowed me to gain an overwhelming edge—if not victory altogether. I used that trick to harvest the overpowered pieces of gear hidden all around the last dungeon, gaining a couple of levels in the process. And all that grinding paid off a million times during the final showdown, indeed. I still don't know if I should commend or blame Nihon Falcom for having had the audacity of stacking up four final boss fights in a row, without any opportunities to save or refurbish in between. Sure, the fourth and last fight is but a mere formality; but it still took me nearly one hour to polish off that formidable meal of a final boss fight. I was lucky enough not to die in the process, which I attribute entirely to my dutiful grinding and to my patient collecting of overpowered equipment. For the record, my final party was made of Joshua, Estelle, Zane and Agate: only powerhouses with close-range weapons, true to my bull-like fighting style in RPGs. I guess one never truly recovers from starting their RPG career with Action-RPGs, indeed.Last but not least, one word for the ending. It was quite long, just as I like my RPG endings to be, and it was also quite bittersweet, something that I had come to expect over the course of the game. I wanted some relationship drama and the game was more than happy to indulge me. I'm extremely glad I played Trails in the Sky in 2016, when the sequel has been localized and made available through the PSN, because playing it at the time of its release and being left with that cliffhanger ending would have been a nasty blow that could have retrospectively tainted my whole run. Fortunately, said sequel is safely tucked away on one of my Vita memory cards, and I can play it right away if the suspense regarding Estelle and Joshua's endeavours becomes too unbearable. As a matter of fact, I'm seriously considering doing just that.While I'm still pondering the matter, I ordered copies of all the PSP Legend of Heroes entries that I didn't own yet—namely Ao no Kiseki, Zero no Kiseki, Sora no Kiseki the 3rd and Sora no Kiseki SC, just for the sake of owning a physical copy. My mission is to play them, along with any other Nihon Falcom game, and confirm whether the series can indeed become one of my favourite RPG series of all times and Nihon Falcom one of my favourite developers of all times. Only time—and play—will tell! Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's delight: The rules of my game", "date": "22/02/2016", "text": "Let's open this post with an telling anecdote, fellow gamers. One day in 2012, I went to the local posthouse to pick up a game I had ordered. Once I was done paying those cursed custom fees, the employee handed me the game and asked me good-naturedly if I was a collector. Despite the fact that I had obviously been purchasing enough games for this guy to spot my name and address, I denied being a collector and added that I was just ordering stuff from internet because it was so comfortable and easy. I pocketed my game and left the place, internally laughing at the guy's assumptions. Me, a collector? What a silly idea! Four years and hundreds of games later, I have to give credit to that post employee for having shown an amazing amount of insight and spotted something that was still invisible and in the making at the time, namely the Game Collector in me. Although I never actively tried to be worthy of that title and still occasionally marvel at how things turned out over just a mere couple of years, the sheer volume and frequency of my gaming purchases does qualify me as a de facto collector. Still, I'm far from being a purist when it comes to collecting games: I only adhere to a couple of collecting rules—mostly custom-mades ones derived from experience. Without futher ado, here are these private rules I dutifully follow when indulging in game-hunting and collecting!Pay to play: I always purchase games that I intend to play—be it five or ten years later. Even the rarest and most wanted game on the face of the earth means nothing to me if it belongs to a genre that I don't favour. As a result, my collection is nearly exclusively composed of RPGs, with a couple of games belonging to other genres here and there. This also means that I don't keep games factory-sealed nor purchase an extra brand-new copy to revere as a cult object—and possibly resell fifteen years later with huge benefits. Mind you, some of my games may prove to be excellent investments on the long run; but I get my paws on them first and foremost to play them.Old is as good as new: I buy second-hand games just as willingly as brand-new games; the only thing that matters is that I own the game in question. The choice of one or the other option usually boils down to the price tag: if  brand-new copies and second-hand copies of a given game cost a similar price, then I will obviously get my paws on a brand-new copy, thank you very much. If the price difference is staggering, which is usually the case with old and/or rare games, then I will wisely go for a cheaper second-hand copy. As for games belonging to the current generation of console, I often purchase them brand-new since the price difference between brand-new and second-hand copies is virtually nonexistent. The full package: One thing I totally refuse to compromise on when hunting for games is the completeness of my purchases. I want the full package: game, box and last but not least, instruction manual. I do not own a single lone cartridge or UMD and I firmly plan to keep things that way. I would rather spend months hunting for a full copy of a game rather than purchase said game alone, even if it is excruciatingly rare. Heck, I would rather give up on the purchase entirely than settle for a cartridge alone! Now, there are obvious exceptions to this iron rule, which are none other than Gameboy and Gameboy Advance games. Since such games were sold in cardboard boxes not designed at all for conservation and perennity, finding full sets in decent condition is excruciatingly hard and ridiculously onerous—not to mention that these cardboard boxes are not practical at all when it comes to housing games. For all these reasons, I go for cartridges alone when hunting for Gameboy and GBA games—although I won't reject a complete game with a decent price tag if it comes my way.The lure of Specials: Like most collectors, I have a soft spot for any edition of a game sporting the tagline \"special\" or \"limited\". That being said, I don't jump blindly on every special edition under the gaming sun; my motto is to purchase a special edition only if the feelies included can somehow enhance the gameplay experience. In practice, this always translates into the presence of an artbook including strategies and data about the game world—so much so that there is virtually no chance I will purchase a special edition if it does not contain an art book. My dream idea of a special edition is embodied by the Silver Edition of Ys: Memories of Celceta and the \"Let's get physical\" edition of Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus, two gorgeous packages graced with splendid art books that also happen to be comprehensive strategy guides rife with interesting data.  Completion galore: Ironically enough for someone who's not a completionist when playing games, I happen to be quite the completionist indeed when it comes to game collecting. When I purchase a game belonging to a series, I usually want to get my paws on the full series in the wake of that first purchase—sometimes without even knowing if I can enjoy said series in the first place. I don't step as far as to purchase games released on platforms that I don't own, fortunately; but every entry released on a system I play must be mine, even if it happens to be a Japanese exclusive. I only show a modicum of restraint if the series is a long-running one that has spawned countless games: in that case, I usually purchase only one or two entries to test the waters first. For instance, I only own two Harvest Moon games, which I yet have to play; if it turns out that I love them, I will go on a full collecting rampage and purchase every single instalment of the series, just like I did with the Pokemon series before. These are the five golden rules of my collecting, the guidelines I dutifully follow when hunting for games. Apart from the fifth one, there are actually quite restrictive; as a result, my collection, whilst of respectable size, has not gained massive proportions. It is certainly not huge enough to fill a full room, but rather a couple of shelves—all the more so as portable games come in rather small cases—and things will probably remain that way since most of my collecting is actually behind me. The PSP and DS libraries are done and dusted after I've \"back-purchased\" every single game that caught my eye—those were the golden years, spent hunting for games so cheap that I could purchase several a week—and all that's left to collect are games from the current generation. I went from purchasing several games a week in a frantic attempt to harvest all the goodness I had missed during my years away from gaming to a much more placid purchasing pace of 1-2 games a month. And maybe that's all for the best, because we're now dealing with brand-new releases with a hefty price tag, not deliciously cheap offerings like back in the days of collecting for the DS and PSP. As for you, dear fellow gamers, feel free to let me know about your own collecting idiosyncrasies in the comments! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Trails in the Sky: Sweet beginnings", "date": "14/02/2016", "text": "Here it is: the retro-looking, story-driven, drama-laden RPG I was craving after clearing three first-person dungeon crawlers in a row. On top of fitting the bill perfectly, Trails in the Sky also provides me with a nice opportunity to give some love to my long-forsaken PSP and to confirm whether Nihon Falcom has the potential to become one of my favourite developers of all time. It's fair to say that things are shaping up nicely and that I may end up writing a passionate love letter to both the game and Nihon Falcom if they keep going that way. But I'm getting ahead of myself there; for now, let's concentrate on my most auspicious first hours of play.We're talking about 15 hours of play there; and given the game's overall pacing, I guess that these 15 hours amount to no more than a fifth of the game's length, or maybe even less. Especially since I'm taking my sweet time and enjoying the trip to the fullest, lolling about rather than rushing my way through. Not that the game is forcing me to do so despite its slow pacing, mind you: I do this on my own free will in order to enjoy the surroundings and atmosphere to the fullest. Never before have I seen a game world so exquisitely and breathtakingly detailed and so amazingly alive; the closest thing to it I've seen was the game world in Legacy of Ys, which makes me think that an uncanny love for detail may be one of Nihon Falcom's trademarks. It certainly helps that the camera can be rotated full circle, allowing for the discovery of even more details and eliciting a pleasant feeling of being in control of the environment. Cherry on the cake, the retro aesthetics of the game are an endless feast to my retro-hungry eyes.Although Trails in the Sky is undoubtedly a story-driven RPG, it is one that judiciously gives the player a lot of leeway. There are numerous places to explore as well as side quests that give a welcome opportunity to take a break from the flow of the main story and indulge in other activities. The art of creating compelling side quests is a delicate one indeed, and I must say that Nihon Falcom masters it to perfection: not only is the number of side quests available just right, neither too overwhelming nor too stingy, but the content of these quests is both varied and interesting and they yield interesting items and monetary rewards to boot. What more can an RPG aficionado who wants to do things their way ask for? Well, maybe a highly customizable fighting system that lets one modify the characters' abilities to good effect. Or maybe a flexible party with two fixed members, the titular duo Estelle and Joshua, and guests fighters that come and go as the story unfolds.And talking about Estelle and Joshua, these two have the most amazing alchemy I've ever seen between party members in an RPG. It certainly doesn't hurt that they seem to be secretly in love with each other, which provides an ample amount of the relationship drama that I was craving after cruising as a solo runner for so long. I'm feasting on the convoluted developments of this duo's relationship while hoping that everything will end well, and I'm rejoicing at the thought that I will meet them again in Trails in the Sky SC.To add to that long list of goodness, Trails is in Sky is decidedly user-friendly. We're talking about instant save (insert eyes teary with happiness), maps coming in various sizes, direction signs, quest and main adventure logs, deliciously fast walking speed à la Ys, little marks that point at objects that can be checked or collected and save one from the hassle of fine-combing the many nooks and crannies of that huge game world, possibility to sell the equipment of guest party members after they leave the party, and so on. They say hell is in the details, but so can be heaven, and it is definitely the case in that game.Had I written this post a couple of hours ago, I would have expressed irritation at the slow pacing and the drawn-out battles as well as worry that they could ruin my fun on the long run. Since then, I've taken them in my stride and accepted them as part of the game's style. More than just accepted, in fact: I genuinely relish Trails in the Sky's placid pacing. The slow unfolding of the story makes me feel like I'm involved in a full-blown fantasy saga à la The Wheel of Time or Lord of the Rings; as for the long battles, I've embraced them after I realized that level-grinding is not mandatory in that game and have since learnt to make the most of them and enjoy them to the fullest.The only two things I'm really not fond of are the washed-out colour palette, which is not always to my retinas' liking, and the cooking feature, which I deem superfluous and not worth the hassle. Cooking has never clicked with me in any RPG I've played and Trails in the Sky's brand of cooking won't do the deed either. I really don't see the point of buying myriads of ingredients that are sometimes hard to find and/or insanely expensive when I can just as easily replenish my HP by crashing at the local inn or stocking up with potions—or fully prepared dishes from the local restaurant, for that matter. Not that these two elements detract from my fun in any way, mind you; I love the game too much to be hindered by such mere details. The cooking feature can easily be ignored entirely, and I think that I may learn to love the faded colour palette on the long run.This sounded like a love letter to the game all right, and I can only hope that my next posts about Trails in the Sky will ooze as much love as this one. See you in a couple of gameplay hours, fellow gamers! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Final Fantasy Explorers: Sweet but (cut) short", "date": "11/02/2016", "text": "When I started playing my freshly received copy of Final Fantasy Explorers, I had an instant and intense crush on the game. I played it until the battery of my 3ds was depleted, and as I was waiting for it to refill, I started devising a lauding post about the game that would have started with the words: \"Sometimes, not having expectations at all is the best way to be pleasantly surprised\". This starry-eyed post will never come to exist, though: eight hours of play later, I'm on the verge of quitting the game entirely.The weird thing is, I still love nearly everything about that game. See for yourself that long list of goodness:—The vistas are breathtaking and the game offers such gorgeous crystalline colours that I could spend minutes just gazing at the sceneries. The level of stylization is just right, with characters models that are neither sickeningly kawaii nor boringly realistic. I'm not a fan of Square, but they sure know how to craft amazingly beautiful games when they want to. —The physics are awesome. This is pure hack-and-slashy goodness, easy to grasp yet never getting old no matter how many foes you slice. Cherry on the cake, the weapons are as classic as they get: we're talking about swords, staves, knuckles, bows and the like, all weapons that will make A-RPG aficionados feel right at home. No over-complicated custom weapons à la Monster Hunter—I'm looking at you, Insect Glaive—which is just perfect for a brute like me who loves nothing more than to charge mobs like a bull and slash them senselessly.—Although the game world is not enormous, it is still vast enough to justify the presence of the world \"explorers\" in the title. Many different types of landscapes are here for the roaming, and the fact the various areas of the game world are connected and can be reached by cruising around on foot makes said game world feel more wholesome and cohesive—although the transitions between areas are often quite abrupt. Add to this the gorgeous vistas and you get a delicious roaming experience that really made me feel like a full-fledged explorer.—The game offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to classes, special attacks and the like. The avatar's class can be changed anytime to gain access to new weapons and tons of interesting abilities can be learned for a modest fee. Some of them can really turn the tables and make an explorer's life easier, such as the \"Regen\" ability that gradually replenish the HP bar.—The menus are clear, detailed and pleasantly intuitive. I've had to endure a slew of crappy menu systems in games I've played lately, so this comes as a real breath of fresh air.  —Last but not least, FFE is not stingy when it comes to monster drops, farming points and quest rewards in general. There is always something to grab as one is roaming around, and even the shortest trip on the field will yield some items and a monetary reward. To be presented with a list of your loot at the end of a quest is a fine pleasure that fills the heart with giddy—and greedy—joy. On top of being fond of all these elements, I couldn't get enough of the initial quests offered by the game. We're talking about tutorial quests and fetch quests that involved roaming the game world under a very lenient time limit; and roam the world did I, drinking in the breathtaking vistas and wreaking havoc on the local fauna. Oh, the joy! It was both relaxing and stimulating, and I could have gone on like that forever, exploring new remote areas while looting and slaughtering every beast in sight. But this dream plan was not meant to be, because once these appetizers were polished off, the game started for good. Off with twenty-bear-asses quests and welcome to the slaughtering of formidable monsters, starting with four Eidolons. Since then, I feel like I've been fighting an endless stream of boss fights, and my interest waned with every one of these fights. Gone are the exploration, the sightseeing, the hack-and-slashing and the looting that I loved so much, and in their place came strict time limits and 30-minutes-long fights against single massive enemies. I lap up epic boss fights as a rule, but not ten times in a row. And not if that's all there is to a game. This is a very peculiar situation that I've never encountered before in any other game. I love everything about FFE except the content of the missions; and yet, since said missions are basically the core of the gameplay, I cannot keep playing despite loving every single other aspect of the game. FFE aside, this turn of events may be the surefire sign that monster-slaughtering games à la Monster Hunter are simply not my cup of tea—which is quite a pity, because I own a couple of titles belonging to that genre. Oh, well. I'll try them all just to be sure that I'm not missing on a gem, but I don't think I will purchase any other Monster Hunter entry. Or Toukiden, for that matter.Since I started writing that post, I've not been touching FFE at all, so it's safe to assume that I'm done with the game for good. The five first hours will go down in my personal gaming history as an incredibly pleasant experience, though, and I won't forget about them. I've at least gotten a modicum of enjoyment out of that game, so the purchase wasn't for naught! And this eye-opening experience will save me from investing more money in monster-slaughtering games that I may not be able to enjoy no matter how hard I try.

{"title": "Collector's delight: Never say never", "date": "08/02/2016", "text": "Maybe I'm just weak. Or maybe I cannot help but love Nintendo after all. Or maybe my collector's instincts are just too overwhelming for my own good. Or maybe all of the above. Whatever the answer, the facts are here in all their empirical glory: a couple of weeks after I claimed that I would probably never buy a Japanese Nintendo 3ds, I did exactly that and purchased one. Behold my gorgeous Metallic Red Japanese Nintendo 3ds and its killer app!To be honest, 7th Dragon III played a major part in my decision to purchase a Japanese 3ds. I saw a couple of screenshots and videos and instantly fell in love with it; and since there is virtually no hope of seeing that colourful dungeon crawler localized, I decided to take matters into my own hands and to get said hands on that game—and on a system to play it. Granted, I could have used one of the many region-lock bypasses available; but Nintendo has a way of countering them on a regular basis, and purchasing a game means nothing to me if I do not have the full certitude that I can play it on and on as years pass. Now, let's take a closer look at this game that single-handedly prompted me to break my word and purchase yet another Nintendo 3ds:Look at this, people! Leaflets!! Covered with gorgeous, vibrant art! Seriously, I could nearly weep with happiness. Sure, these leaflets are ridiculously thin compared to the ones offered by games from the previous generation, but they are there, and that's more than we usually get in the West. And that Sega logo... It brings back fond memories of the time when Sega was ubiquitous, and I couldn't help but smile when I saw it. Even though Sega has this infuriating way of snubbing us Westerners. Oh, well.The good consequence of that purchase—apart from the fact that I can play 7th Dragon III anytime now—is that it somehow opened the floodgates for the collecting of Japanese 3ds games. I have no reasons to hold back anymore and I can now purchase such games without a second though, and I firmly intend to do so. More potential material to sate my collector's cravings, yay! If you know of a must-have Japanese 3ds title, feel free to let me know in the comments. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Moco Moco Friends: Cute but unpolished", "date": "05/02/2016", "text": "I'm done with cute Pokemon-like dungeon crawler Moco Moco Friends after... well, an undertermined number of hours of play, since MMF doesn't provide the player with a timer. This oversight somehow sums up the entirety of that game: Moco Moco Friends is cute, charming and addictive, but it's also lazy, unpolished and superficial. The game's undeniable qualities are tarnished by numerous shortcomings that prevents it from reaching gaming greatness; instead of a cult classic or even a excellent game, we have a palatable one that is certainly enjoyable but by no means extraordinary. Without further ado, here's the enumeration of Moco Moco Friends' positive sides, along with the flaws that mar them.—The small dungeons are perfect for sweet and short bursts of crawling. It's like the very essence of dungeon crawling, i.e. exploration, looting and fighting, has been extracted and repackaged in a pint-sized version. Each dungeon hardly requires more than ten minutes to be cleared, but these ten minutes provide plenty of roaming, fighting and looting. Especially looting, because MMF is anything but stingy with items. Cherry on the cake, all the dungeons are gorgeous—those vivid colours!—and sport upbeat theme tracks that make one want to run around joyfully. What a pity, then, to see this fulfilling crawling experience spoilt by an uninspired dungeon design that doesn't make room for traps, puzzles, hidden areas or anything that could spice up the roaming. Even a trick as simple as making one of the resident Plushkins hold the key to the next floor until they are defeated would have pleasantly livened up the monotonous roaming of these never-changing succession of rooms and corridors. And it certainly doesn't help that dungeons are so tiny: with two floors only, they barely qualify as dungeons. It's pretty obvious that the developers indulged in as much laziness as they could get away with and that they would have gladly implemented single-floor dungeons if not for the fact that the game would have become a mere platformer in the process. —Fighting is a stimulating, fast-paced and streamlined affair that never gets old despite its simplicity. I was really fond of the shortcut system that allows to choose an action by pressing the D-pad and the lush fighting animations were a feast to the eye. Seeing the stuffing pop out of injured Plushkins was nearly too adorable to handle, and their cute little voices made me melt. And let's not talk about their looks: all these fluffy creatures were so incredibly charming that I wanted to recruit nearly all of them on the spot, especially in the late stages of the game. (These foxes and deers were so elegant!) Yes, you read that right: the serial solo runner wanted to play a full-party run. Alas, it turned out that the game wasn't exactly in the mood to indulge me. For, lo and behold, recruitment in MMF is totally random. There is no device à la Pokeball to capture the Plushkins, who decide themselves whether they wish to follow you. And unfortunately, they do not wish it that often. And when they do, they turn out to be mostly useless anyway. Let's face it: the party dynamics in MMF are terrible. Not only are all the Plushkins significantly weaker than Scrunchie, but they are also affected with arbitrary level limitations; and whilst Scrunchie evolves automatically, other Plushkins can only evolve through the use of ridiculously rare items that are a pain to obtain. Maintaining an efficient party in that game requires much more effort that it should, and it wasn't long before I was cruising with Scrunchie alone and using other Plushkins solely as Training fodder to level her up. Once at her peak level, she was pretty much unstoppable and could one-shoot most opponents without breaking a sweat, which was tremendously fulfilling. And yet, had the game been more accommodating and made party maintainance a pleasure instead of a hassle, I would have gladly roamed the dungeons with a full party. —The crafting system is both simple to grasp and really original, and makes good use of every single collected item. There's something curiously addictive in the act of planting seeds in pots before literally reaping the materials that blossom out of these pots and taking said materials to the sewing factory to obtain items. It's efficient, it's productive, and it allows you to get your paws on tons of items. Too bad that 90% of these items are literally useless. The only items that are really useful—Rainbow Hearts, high-level Awaken items and the like—are also incredibly rare, and obtaining them require an awful lot of crafting, because the production of items is just as random as the recruitment of Plushkins. Every step of the crafting process will produce a certain type of item, but there is no way to choose precisely which specific item will be produced, which is an absolute pain in the behind. And since the selling prices of the local shop are ridiculously low, the mountains of useless items that come out of the crafting process can't even be used for shameless enrichment. Jeez, what a waste. —The production values are excellent. We're talking about lovely graphics, lively soundtrack, adorable character designs and an overall lushness that makes the game quite irresistible. All that goodness makes the following shortcomings all the more surprising and disappointing. Why is the game world so pitifully tiny, making Gameboy-era Pokemon entries look like Skyrim compared to MMF? Why is the pacing of the missions so tedious and repetitive, alternating between Sealing Evil Vortex/Helping friends train/Retrieving important item—rinse and repeat ad nauseam? Last but not least, why was the ending completely blotched, sending the player back to the point before fighting the final boss even after said final boss has been beaten? That was understandable in older RPGs without postgame that didn't automatically save after beating the final boss, but MMF does save automatically after the last fight and grants access to a postgame dungeon; so why do all the characters keep acting like the final boss has never been beaten? Whether this is a glitch or an oversight, it is frustrating and ruins the pleasure of having cleared the main game. —MMF has an addictive quality that made me want to play it over and over again. It seemed that I could never get enough of the fast-paced combat, the quick and flowing roaming and the productive looting, and I would gladly have explored more dungeons if they had been available. Thus, there was absolutely no need for the copious amount of fake longevity that was injected into the game. There was no need for this imprecise crafting system that requires tons of tries and retries to yield something useful, nor was it necessary to make the high-level Evolve, Bloom and Awaken items so insanely rare and difficult to obtain. And let's not even talk about the criminally stupid decision to leave Plushkins' recruitment to chance AND to make all Hearts but the elusive rainbow one basically useless in boosting up recruitment rate. If you want your game to be longer, fill it up with extra content, not with gameplay limitations that ruin the fun.  Mind you, I actually liked Moco Moco Friends despite its flaws, and I do have very fond memories of it. However, I have to admit that I expected to like it more. The mix of Pokemon-inspired recruiting and fighting mechanics and dungeon crawling seemed like a match made in heaven, but the result was underwhelming and missed the mark on both sides. Neither the recruiting and fighting mechanics nor the dungeon crawling are fully satisfying, and the game suffers greatly from it. That being said, I think the formula is quite promising and could be easily improved on and yield great results. Make the dungeons larger and more cleverly designed, rebalance the Plushkins, add a couple of features to get rid of the need for fake longevity and voilà! This could produce the perfect mix between creature-recruiting and dungeon-crawling, and I certainly hope that such a game will come to exist and that Moco Moco Friends will be more than a one-shot game. We need new exciting RPG franchises, we do! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's delight: Latest catch", "date": "29/01/2016", "text": "A lot of special editions of high-profile Vita and 3ds games have been released lately and just as many are slated for release in the next months—to my utter delight. I have a couple of these appetizing packs pre-ordered already; but for now, let's concentrate on the ones that already graced my letterbox. Without further ado, here's my latest collection catch!Let's start with the \"Lionheart Edition\" of Trails of Cold Steel. This special edition comes with a very reasonable price tag, and there's a reason for it: it is actually quite lacklustre. The case could have been beautiful, had it not been marred by a bunch of garish logos, and the Erebonian Empire pin is just a bauble that could as well not have been there for all the value it adds to this special edition. I was expecting the 140-pages artbook to be a work of art similar to the one included in the Silver Edition of Ys: Memories of Celceta, with strategies and a full description of the game world included. We're talking about the same developer and same publisher in both cases, so there were good reasons to hope, right? Alas, my hopes were dashed by the actual content of Trails on Cold Steel's artbook. That deceptively thick tome is all fluff and contains nothing more than mundane descriptions of the characters along with a few pages of concept art and tons of nondescript illustrations that bring strictly nothing to the gaming experience per se. In a nutshell, I'm disappointed, and I think Nihon Falcom and XSeed could have done better.Then comes the special edition I couldn't have done without for the life of me, namely the one and only physical release of Atelier Escha and Logy Plus on Western shores. Despite having been released hardly ten days ago, this special edition is already quite hard to find and the prices will probably skyrocket before long, so I'm glad I managed to secure a copy on time. Collectors must be early birds to get their paws on coveted games, indeed! Putting aside the fact that this special edition is made valuable by the fact that it is the sole physical edition of the game available in the West, there is nothing too extraordinary to be found in this lovely paper box starring the titular characters. It's your run-of-the-mill special edition with soundtrack, poster and a small 38-pages artbook that certainly didn't require hours of work.One last paragraph for my very first Japanese Vita game, the roguelike Omega Labyrinth. I decided not to wait for an hypothetical Western release, especially since that release may never happen given the risqué content of the game, and took instead my first steps into the vast world of Japanese Vita games. And blimey, didn't I discover a shocking truth whilst doing so: Japanese Vita games are insanely expensive. All the more so if they are loaded with fan-service. My copy of Omega Labyrinth cost me a whopping $60, and many Japanese Vita games boast similar prices. And unfortunately, there's no hope of witnessing a price drop once the Vita's tenure is over; if anything, it would probably be the opposite. Not that it matters, mind you: I was surprised by these steep prices, but they certainly won't stop me from purchasing more Japanese Vita games. There are so many inviting Japanese exclusives that it would be a shame not to get my collector's paws on them, really.That's all for this post, fellow gamers; I'll see you soon with more mouth-watering special editions. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Moe Chronicles: Final thoughts", "date": "17/01/2016", "text": "After 30 hours of intense Roaming 'n' Rubbing, I am officially done with Moe Chronicles.Mind you, that doesn't mean that I actually finished the game. After having beaten a Final Boss of sorts, I am currently in the middle of a extra chapter called \"Epilogue\" that doesn't really know if it wants to be an epilogue or a full-blown postgame segment. I didn't witness any rolling of credits yet, so I guess this extra chapter qualifies as an epilogue after all, even though it could as well have been called: \"Fake longevity on a silver platter\". It involves revisiting the six dungeons of the game in order to explore previously sealed areas before fighting another Final Boss; and as though the prospect of somehow replaying the whole game a second time were not tedious enough, the difficulty has been ramped up to an unsufferable level. I had my first Game Overs during this chapter, and that was a hard wake-up call after the previous confortable easiness of the game. The random encounter rate is still just as high as before, if not higher, and all that makes for a very unpleasant roaming experience. The final nail in the coffin is the fact that the number of Monster Girls available for recruitment has dropped down while the planned obsolescence of Monster Girls is occurring much faster. My current line-up comprises Coco, Ranju, Gargoyle, Mocha and Griffin, and Gargoyle and Mocha are as good as useless despite the fact that I recruited them in the fifth and sixth dungeons of the game, i.e. just before starting the Epilogue chapter. And since my newest recruits—Coco and Griffin, who replaced Istasia and Kobold—are already in the party, my only option is to forge ahead until I encounter new Monster Girls, which I'm definitely not in the mood to do. So I'm calling it quits with a big smile of relief on my face.Those 30 hours were quite lovely, I have to admit. Moe Chronicles may not be the best first-person dungeon crawler ever, but it's certainly solid enough to be entertaining. Here's a list of all the good and less good points of the game:The good: —Not equipment galore. There are only four pieces of gear that can be worn by all the Monster Girls, so the best ones can pretty much be used during the whole game and passed up from one party member to the next.—Leveling and powering up Monster Girls is quite easy. The high random encounter rate makes for a fast progression in terms of levels and stats can be considerably increased by wearing equipment. Inactive Monster Girls still gain 30% of the XP reaped in battle (and up to 70% if their rooms are refurbished maximally) and can thus be integrated in the party without too much hassle. Even better, the acquisition of the Skills specific to each Monster Girls is not tied to levels, but rather to the number of battles fought; this means that Skills can be gained quite fast by fighting easy battles in the first dungeons of the game. —The story packs some unexpected depth (minor spoilers). Starting off as crappy, run-of-the-mill fan-servicy fare, it slowly morphs into an unexpected parable about the nature of sexual desire and its potential to be either a destructive or a constructive force depending on how it is approached and dealt with. Hero Io matures over the course of the game and learns to face and accept his own desires and to express them in a positive fashion, going from a shy, leering, harem-fantasizing teenager to a young adult who proudly claims his love for his childhood friend Lilia while being fully reconciled with the fact that he enjoys looking at females. It's nearly like the game is lecturing fan-service aficionados while gently poking fun at them, which is quite unexpected from the genre. This is basically a harem game saying that harem is not the solution and that horny teenage boys must master their desires and find their true soulmate to feel happy and fulfilled; and heck, that was quite the plot twist.—The Monster Girls are quite distinctive in terms of abilities while being all potentially useful in battle; there are no worthless, nearly unusable party members with crappy abilities to be found in Moe Chronicles. Each Monster Girl is a unique combination of elemental affinity, skills and so-called \"Moe Traits\" that grant special benefits, and they can all shine when combined properly. Some combinations can even produce unexpected positive effects such as regeneration of HP and SP at the end of battles. (Which, for the record, is activated by the combination of the Moe Traits \"Tiny tits\" and \"Lolita\".)The bad: —The planned obsolescence of the Monster Girls. Encouraging players to experiment with their party is one thing, but nearly forcing them to do so in another, and a much less pleasant one at that. This coercion of sorts is actually counter-productive and becomes restrictive on the long run, because it eliminates the oldest recruits from the roster of potential party members by making them nearly unusable. The player has no choice but to discard Monster Girls as the game goes on if they don't want to endure some insane level-grinding, which means that a good portion of the Girls will never reach their full potential—or be used at all, for that matter. Granted, I've seen some playthroughs of the game in which the oldest Monster Girls are battling the Final Boss, so it is feasible; but I'm pretty sure that such an endeavour implies a lot of extra grinding and/or buffing up with expensive gear. The option of resorting to newer and stronger Monster Girls is obviously more tempting, and yet it shouldn't be. The Girls should all have been granted the same global efficiency at a given level, period. Slowing down their progression was entirely unwarranted; I'm pretty sure that their irresistible cuteness and well-crafted uniqueness would have been more than enough to encourage players to swap them throughout the game. —There is a modicum of fake longevity at work in Moe Chronicles. The absence of an instant save feature, the grueling random encounter rate and the forced revisiting of all the dungeons of the game in the Epilogue chapter are all guilty of artificially extending the game's lifespan. Be also prepared to pour a considerable amount of time into the game if you want to reach full harem completion and max out all the Girls' affections, refurbish their rooms to the highest level and obtain all their extra outfits. And talking about this...—The extra outfits granted by the game are a total scam. Since they raise half of the stats while lowering the other half, you're as good with the original outfit. On top of that, these \"outfits\" are only swimsuits with various patterns. Really, game? Can't we have a bit of imagination here? Maybe not the overused maid costume, but what about cosplay outfits or even a bit of lingerie? Swimsuits only are boring, and Senran Kagura does them better than you anyway.—Poor production values, which I already described in my first post about the game.All in all, I'm glad I played Moe Chronicles, and I even have plans for a future run in which I will experiment more profusely with party combinations. That being said, I have to admit that after playing three first-person dungeon crawlers in close succession, I am suffering from a serious case of dungeon crawler fatigue. What I'm really craving right now is a meaty story-driven RPG, preferably with retro-looking aesthetics, a ridiculously convoluted storyline and a lot of relationship drama. I'm probably going to regret having ever nursed that thought before being done with said story-driven RPG, but it doesn't matter. The gaming instinct wants what it wants! And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to dig for that compensating meaty story-driven RPG in my vast gaming collection. (Suggestions are welcome!) Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Moe Chronicles: Gotta rub 'em all!", "date": "10/01/2016", "text": "The untimely interruption of my playthrough of Dungeon Travelers 2 left a giant first-person dungeon crawler-shaped hole in my heart. In order to fill that hole, I dove straight into Moe Chronicles as soon as my DT2 cartridge was back in its box. 15 hours later, I'm still deep down there and enjoying to trip to the fullest.Although I'm glued to the game now, the early stages were rather inauspicious. Far from succumbing to the kind of instant crush I experienced with games like Demon Gaze and DT2, I was left unimpressed and even vaguely grossed out by MC, to the point of nearly considering quitting. I'll expand later on the reasons why I felt that way; for now, suffice it to say that I overcame these mixed feelings and learnt to love the game in earnest, to the point where nothing could be further from my mind than quitting.I compared Criminal Girls to the Pokemon series before, but Moe Chronicles is the game that would genuinely deserve the appelation of \"Pokemon: Pervy Version\". Here is a game that has been designed purposefully as a collecting feast, with alluring monster girls in lieu of cute animals. And let's be honest: whoever was in charge of the character design did an amazing job. The Monster Girls are incredibly cute, each one having her own unique style and being instantly recognizable. Despite the fact that I'm too old to succumb to the lure of moe, I find all the girls absolutely adorable and always feel a thrill of excitement when encountering a new one.Mind you, recruiting Monster Girls is significantly easier than recruiting Pokemons. There is only one Monster Girl of each type, and recruiting them doesn't imply pacing back and forth to trigger random encounters. Instead, each Monster Girl roams a small designated area and will do so until she is recruited. How convenient! Since we're talking about a Pokemon rip-off, it should make perfect sense that the recruitment process involves fighting the cornered Monster Girl in order to make her more... amenable, shall we say. Then comes the rubbing part, which is the equivalent of tossing a Pokeball at a weakened 'Mon and crossing your fingers while hoping for success—except that in that case, you do not keep your fingers crossed. Securing the recruitment of a Monster Girl involves poking the Vita screen in order to discover the girl's sensitive points; and while this may sound like pure fan-servicy fare, these phases are more complicated than one may think. For one thing, each Monster Girl has three sensitive points that must be rubbed in a given order; for another, these points are more often than not located on random body parts such as the ankle, the tip of the nose or the forearm, so going straight for bottoms or bosoms won't do the trick; and last but not least, the whole process is timed, and very unforgivingly at that. This strict time limit is what makes these rubbing phases compelling, transforming them into a full-blown challenge instead of the complacent fan-service display that they seem to be at first sight. Fail to pinpoint all sensitive areas and the involved Monster Girl will escape, forcing you to restart the whole recruiting process. I've currently reached a stage in the game where the time limit during the rubbing phases is so strict that there is virtually no chance of capturing a Monster Girl on the first try unless I'm lucky enough to put my finger right on her sensitive spots—literally.It doesn't take long to realize than Moe Chronicles is hell-bent on forcing the player to go harem and to play with as many Monster Girls as possible, switching them at will and trying all sorts of party combinations. And truth must be told, this is actually the game's strongest point: the Monster Girls' abilities are so incredibly varied and so perfectly complementary that combining them is a joy rather than a chore and produces more often than not parties with a stellar alchemy. And stellar it should be, because this is a game that forbids solo runs—or any run involving less than a five-member party, for that matter. I was a bit crestfallen when discovering that, but quickly got over my disappointment when I realized that XP was attributed equally to all party members and not divided between them. (For instance, if a fight yields 10XP, each of the five party members will get 10XP and not just 2XP like in most RPGs.) To make switching between party members even smoother, newly recruited Monster Girls don't start at Lv.1 but rather at a level similar to the one of your party members, and the Monster Girls that are part of your roster yet not in the party still gain a modicum of XP—and that amount can be increased by refurbishing their rooms. But the game goes even further in its dedication to introduce the player to the joys of party-switching: should you decide to stick with the same party from beginning to end, this is made impossible by the implementation of what can only be described as planned obsolescence in the Monster Girls.Here's how it works: as the game goes on, the progression of the Monster Girls slows down. They keep gaining levels, but their stats increase slower, up to the unavoidable moment when they become too weak to be efficient in battle and have to be replaced by newer and fresher Monster Girls—as a matter of fact, this downgrading of sorts usually happens around the time a Monster Girl with similar abilities is available for recruitment. I learnt about this cruel hidden rule the hard way: by the end of the first dungeon, my party comprised Lilia, Latte, Killer Bee, Goblin and Kobold and their alchemy was so perfect that I was firmly planning to cruise around with these Fab Five until the end. Alas, that was not meant to be: as I explored the fourth dungeon, I noticed that Lilia was starting to show alarming signs of weakness. She was taking more damage and her formely powerful hits were now hardly scratching foes, to the point where she become more a liability than an asset in battle. Although I didn't want to part with her, I had no other choice but to replace her by a newer Monster Girl with similar abilities, namely the powerful Dragon. I though this would be the end of it, but shortly after, the other girls in my team started showing the exact same symptoms, to my utter dismay. This led to a complete overhaul of my party, as I grudgingly replaced Latte, Killer Bee and Goblin by Jack-o'-Lantern, Kamaitachi and Minotaur respectively. The only original member I maintained was Kobold, because her turf is Healing and she's still stellar at it and because there are no other Monster Girls with skills similars to hers. I have yet to get used to the dynamic of that new party, but I've mostly gotten over my disappointment at losing my initial Fab Five. As a matter of fact, I've even developed a genuine relish for experimenting with party members, and I may well try a couple of other combinations before I'm done with the game.The only downside of that otherwise great dungeon crawler, and the reason why I was not impressed by it at first, are the miserable production values. It's pretty obvious that a huge chunk of the game's budget went into designing the Monster Girls and that everything else got the short end of the stick. The designs of regular enemies are ugly, the soundtrack is mediocre, moving around feels painfully slow and clunky (although I ultimately got used to it) and, last but not least, the dungeon layouts are lustreless and pitifully basic, with none of the creativity at work in Dungeon Travelers 2 or Demon Gaze. There are no traps, no hidden rooms, no clever design tricks to be found; only empty corridors, dead ends and the occasional damage floor or one-way door, which seem to have been thrown there as an afterthought. To dissimulate somewhat that design poverty and prevent players from clearing dungeons too fast, the random encounter rate has been cranked up to Dragon Quest levels. This is by far the highest random encounter rate I've encountered so far in a first-person dungeon crawler, much higher than the rates at work in DT2 or Demon Gaze. These nearly constant encounters often get in the way of roaming and exploration, and despite my love for grinding, I find myself occasionally irritated by the fact that it's virtually impossible to take three steps without triggering a fight. Another point that rubbed me the wrong way is the absence of an instant save feature, combined with the fact that save points in dungeons are few and far between. Granted, the game is not excruciatingly hard and I've never lost a shred of my progression because of an unexpected Game Over so far, but the impossibility of instant-saving introduces a modicum of unease in my roaming that I could have done without.All in all, while Moe Chronicles' grindy brand of dungeon crawling may not be as solid and engrossing as the crawling experiences offered by DT2 and Demon Gaze, it is still perfectly palatable and amply justifies playing the game. Expect at least another post about Moe Chronicles, maybe more if I'm inspired enough. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have some Roaming 'n' Rubbing to perform! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Coveted Games: Early 2016, a.k.a. Games aplenty", "date": "05/01/2016", "text": "Happy New Year, fellow gamers! I hope your Christmas holidays were as fun as mine, with plenty of delicious food and gaming involved. Now comes a new year, along with a new list of coveted games! The first months of 2016 look promising indeed, with lots of exciting physical and digital releases for both the 3ds and the Vita. And when I say \"lots\", I mean lots. There will be spending! Without further ado, here's my (long) list of coveted games for early 2016! Enjoy, and don't hesitate to share your own coveted games in the comments!—Atelier Escha and Logy Plus (Vita): My heart skipped a beat when I learnt that NISA would release limited physical copies of that game, just like they did with Ar Nosurge Plus. I promptly secured myself a copy—for a small fortune, since I'm not lucky enough to live in North-America and be able to order directly from NISA. But as they say, when it comes to love, you don't count the (shipping) cost! —Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth (Vita): I'm still hesitating about this one. On one hand, I very much want to discover the series, and I've read only good things about that particular game; on the other hand, this is a digital-only release, and I decided to avoid these as much as possible since my unpleasant discovery regarding the PSN and digital games. A good compromise would be to buy the European digital version on a sale, play it and then purchase the Japanese physical version for collecting purposes if it turns out that I like the game. Let's wait and see! Edit: I just discovered that Play Asia have pre-orders opened for a physical Asian version of the game, supposedly with english text and/or dialogues. Now that would solve the issue!—The Legend of Legacy (3ds): This game is already out in North-America, and reviews from both critics and gamers are not exactly stellar. I still want to play it though, if only because I've loved poorly reviewed games often enough to give me hope that I will love this one. I toyed with the idea of importing the gorgeous North-American launch edition for a while, but the cursed region lock and the prospective custom taxes deterred me from taking the plunge. Instead, I'll just patiently wait for february like the rest of Europe.—Stella Glow (3ds): Another game that has been released in North-America some time ago, but this time to critical acclaim. It also has a beautiful North-American launch edition that I won't buy because of the cursed region lock. Different game, same annoying story! Anyway, this game has already gone down in history as Imageepoch's swan song; and in an ironic twist of fate, it may turn out to be the very first Imageepoch game I'll ever play. I own several other games from that company, but they are still untouched and I highly doubt that my gaming instinct will prompt me to play them before Stella Glow, which I very much want to play as soon as possible. —Stranger of Sword City (Vita): I read about this first-person dungeon crawler extensively on Kina's blog, with many a wistful sigh at the though that I would probably never touch that great-looking game. Then, lo and behold, it's being released on the Vita! In Europe!! Boxed!!! To say that I'm elated about this unexpected turn of events would definitely be an understatement. (Insert starry eyes.) —Odin Sphere Leifþrasir (Vita): This Vanillaware RPG soaked with references to Norse mythology looks just as good as Dragon's Crown, which amply justifies a purchase. I was rather surprised to learn that it is actually a remake of a PS2 game, because I had absolutely never heard of the original. (Not that I'm a PS2 expert by any means, mind you.) Although I'm not too fond of port and remakes, porting or remaking unknown games is perfectly fine in my book, since it can give them an opportunity to shine and perform better than during their first release. It's still unclear whether Europe will get a physical version, but yours truly will get one no matter what. Bless the Vita and its absence of region lock!—Trillion God of Destruction (Vita): Any dungeon crawler with roguelike elements is a must-have as far as I'm concerned, so I'm going to purchase this game with my eyes closed. It has a touch of harem to boot, and I hope the romancing parts will be well handled and engrossing. After the tepid romances I've endured in Lord of Magna, Conception 2 and Criminal Girls, I could use a bit of thrill in that departement, thank you very much.—Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon (3ds): Another dungeon crawler with roguelike elements that I must absolutely purchase, all the more so as I loved the first 3ds entry of the series. This new instalment is supposed to take its cues from Explorers of Sky rather than from Gates to Infinity, which would delight me since I loved the former even more than the latter. The only thing that saddens me is the absence of an evocative subtitle such as the two mentioned above—not to mention that slapping \"super\" in the middle of the title is a cheap throwback to the '90s that I could have done without. Oh, well.  —Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight (3ds): Although I have yet to play any Etrian Odyssey game, this won't stop me from purchasing this remake of the series' second instalment. We're talking about first-person dungeon crawlers here, so it's absolutely sure that I will adore this game—and its predecessors. And since I own the whole series already, it only makes sense that I buy The Fafnir Knight as well. Collection consistency, folks!—Final Fantasy Explorers (3ds): I'm not expecting any kind of gaming greatness from Square Enix in general and from this game in particular. FFE seems to be an shameless attempt to capitalize on the success of monster-slaughtering franchises like Monster Hunter, peppered with a heavy dose of Final Fantasy fan service to boot, and that's a mix that is hardly bound to excite me. So why is that game on the list, you may ask? Well, first because it's a Action-RPG, and these little darlings of mine are getting pretty rare nowadays; and second, because I'm an eternal optimist and I may be pleasantly surprised by this game after all—all the more so if I expect nothing amazing from it in the first place.—Senran Kagura: Estival Versus (Vita): After SK2 on the 3ds, we are getting another Senran Kagura entry on the Vita. I fully commend Tamsoft's dedication to craft SK instalments for both systems as well as Marvelous' dedication to offer all sorts of yummy special editions, and I think the two are doing an amazing job with the franchise. I have not yet decided which edition I will pre-order, but I will definitely get myself that new instalment and indulge into more campy, busty fighting. Bring it on!—MegaTagdimension Blanc+Neptune vs Zombies (Vita): The title is a hot mess, and the concept of the game even more so. Some Hack'n'Slash involving zombies laced with a bit of dressing up, if I understood well. Not that it matters so much, mind you: I love the series and I love its amazing fighting physics, and that's amply enough to justify a purchase. Plus, I already own all the Vita entries, so I might as well keep on purchasing every HN instalment that comes my way. Collection consistency again! —Summon Night 5 (PSP): A PSP game, of all things! What a pleasant surprise! I knew right away that I needed the limited physical edition of that game, and I pre-ordered a copy a couple of weeks ago. I'm now crossing my fingers and hoping that everything will work fine and that my pre-order will not be cancelled because of a lack of stocks. (Unlikely though, since we're not talking about Nintendo merchandise.) Anyway, the release of a PSP RPG in 2016 is incredibly refreshing, and I can only hope that we will see more of these late RPG releases in the years to come—starting with Class of Heroes 3, also brought to us by Gaijinworks. Better late than never, indeed!That's a whole lot of games, and this list is only covering the first four months of 2016—and that's without even counting the random digital indie RPG à la Bastion that pops up unannounced. 2016 promises to be a glorious gaming year indeed, and I cannot wait to get myself all these mouth-watering games. This most auspicious start should help to make up for the end of 2015, which looked promising but turned out to be a trifle disappointing. Some of my coveted games of that time were delayed, such as Return to Popolocrois and Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice, and the unanimous criticism regarding Tri Force Heroes' poorly implemented and frustrating single player mode deterred me from purchasing the game. After these snubs of fate, I am more eager than ever to gorge on gaming purchases, and 2016 seems more than ready to indulge me. To a glorious gaming year to come! Happy 2016 again, fellow gamers; may your gaming wish lists be bursting at the seams and your consoles be stuffed with great games! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Dungeon Travelers 2: The unsavoury bits + Final thoughts", "date": "02/01/2016", "text": "Back for my ultimate post about DT2! I want to enumerate the few points that rubbed me the wrong way and routinely annoyed me during my otherwise fantastic playthrough of the game—which I will sum up once I'm done with said points. No game is ever perfect, indeed, and although DT2 did an amazingly high number of things right, it also did a couple of things wrong. Here are the joykillers in all their annoying glory:DT2 is heavily skewed toward elemental magic spells and status effect-inducing attacks. Sure, this is not at all uncommon in RPGs, and it makes even more sense in that particular game because of the Chanting Time: since casting spells is a long process that can fail before being completed, it feels only fair that the payoff for succeeding should be hugely rewarding. Still, the game took the reward a trifle too far. Making spells inflict literally fifty to one hundred times more damage than regular physical attacks is completely exaggerated, just like making regular enemy attacks cause status effects. From a certain point in the game, it is simply impossible to emerge from random battles without being afflicted with a status effect—or a couple of them, for that matter. Sure, they wear off after some time—bar the dreaded Petrification—but it's still incredibly annoying. As for the damage ratio, here's a telling example: even when I was towering a good fifty levels above my foes during the late stages of the game, said foes' elemental spells still dealt 150 to 450 points of damage while their physical attacks hardly ever dealt more than 3 to 20 points of damage. And that was while wearing some equipment raising my elemental defense, thank you very much. Although this discrepancy didn't stop my progression by any means, it is completely outrageous and definitely qualifies as a flaw in my book.The financial balance in the early stages of the game is absolutely horrendous. Everything costs an arm and a leg while random battles and sold items only yield a ridiculously tiny amount of money, meaning that it's hardly possible to buy anything without copious amount of grinding. Since I was running solo, I managed to avoid grinding specifically for money; but my finances were more than tight during the first half of the game, leaving me with hardly enough money to purchase healing items for boss fights. If maintaining a financial balance was hard for me as a solo runner, I don't even want to imagine how excruciating it could be to keep a full party furbished with the little money granted by that stingy game. Although things fortunately get better as the game goes on, it's hard to look past the financial hardships of its early stages.The capacity of the inventory is way too limited. Thirty slots that can each accommodate nine copies of a given item may seem like a lot of inventory space, but in practice, the limitations show up very quickly. Monster drops are so incredibly abundant that it only takes a couple of battles to fill up the inventory, after which gained items are discarded. That wouldn't be such a huge issue if not for the precarious money balance that I mentioned above, which makes every item a unmissable commodity that can be either used or sold and has to be salvaged at all costs. By \"all costs\", I mean escaping the dungeon with an Emergency Exit every time my bag was full, selling or storing my loot and going back into the dungeon to have my bag filled up again after a couple of battles—rinse and repeat. My inventory finally expanded by five slots after I cleared enough side quests, which gave me a welcome latitude; but honestly, I had to exit from dungeons to empty my choke-full inventory a couple too many times for my taste and comfort. The difficulty level is often ill-balanced. Don't get me wrong: DT2 is overall a tough and challenging game for all the good reasons, and far from resenting that toughness, I'm lapping it up and relishing the challenge to the fullest. What I'm not lapping up and relishing, however, are the wild and uncanny difficulty fluctuations that occur both in random battles and boss battles. Battles with similar enemies can result in vastly different outcomes, from the finest to the direst: depending on which attacks your foes of the moment decide to unleash, your party can either escape unscathed with hardly a shred of damage or be wiped out after two turns—or anything in between. This can obviously lead to some progress loss when you suddenly hit a hardcore battle and get beaten into a pulp, and it prompted me to save literally every three steps during the first half of the game. This issue receded and became but a distant memory as I progressed and gained a overwhelming edge over foes, but it definitely tainted the first twenty hours of my playthrough.Last come a couple of minor annoyances that I was rather surprised to encounter in a 2015 RPG. For instance, when you browse items in the Library's shop, the game doesn't let you know how many copies of a given item you already own; to know that, you have to select \"Sell\" to check your inventory. Also, the menu cannot be opened while in the Library and the only way to access the menu options is through the \"Guild\" section. It is also impossible to try on new equipment if your bag is full: there must be at least one empty slot to remove the piece of gear you want to change. Small details allright, but nevertheless annoying on the long run.  Now that I'm done with the unsavoury bits, here's a digest of the second half of my playthrough. The game got easier by the dungeon thanks to the massive amounts of XP that I stockpiled, and by the time I reached the last dungeon, I was so overleveled that no random battle could take me down. The Final Boss Battle was a mere formality, and the only reason why I needed three tries instead of one to wrap up that battle was that said Final Boss wields a formidable attack that can inflict up to 2000 points of damage. I succumbed twice to this pest, to my utter annoyance. Fortunately for me, my HP was somewhere around the 2200 mark by that point; so during my third try, I dutifully kept my HP above 2000 and managed to stay alive and to beat the final boss to a pulp. Sweet, sweet victory! After that, I threw myself enthusiastically into the postgame dungeons with the firm intention of clearing them all. Alas, that glorious plan was not meant to be, as all my drive evaporated when I learnt that levels didn't go beyond 99. That dreadful fact meant that I would be overpowered by foes sooner or later—sooner rather than later, since I had reached Lv.93 at that point—and knowing that annihilated on the spot any desire to explore the postgame dungeons. Sure, I could have reset my levels in order to gain some stat increases à la Dragon Quest IX, if not for one tiny detail: unlike DQIX, Dungeon Travelers 2 packs no Metal Slimes to allow for some power-grinding—along with convenient spots to hunt for them. That meant regular level-grinding, which I was definitely not in the mood for; and that's how I finally gave up on DT2 with a deep sigh of regret and a heavy heart after 45 hours of intense roaming, exploring and rampaging.Despite that postgame fiasco, my feelings for DT2 remain unashamedly positive. I absolutely adored that game from beginning to end and I would have played much more of it if not for that level issue. As a matter of fact, I am definitely planning to play more of it no matter what: there will be another playthrough for sure, and that time around, I may go as far as to play with a three-ladies party—maybe even with a full party, if I have the guts to put up with all the micromanagement involved. I want to discover more characters and more classes, not to mention explore the vast postgame territory, and all that involves a bigger party and a longer playthrough. I don't know when this second playthrough will happen, but it will definitely happen at some point. Last but not least, to all my fellow dungeon-crawler aficionados out there: play that amazing gem of a game, you won't regret it! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Nintendo 3ds: It's complicated", "date": "26/12/2015", "text": "My relationships with my gaming systems have been straightforward, unfussy and unashamedly positive for the most part. I wholeheartedly adored The Gameboy, the Game Gear and the Megadrive until I had to let them go because of a lack of games to purchase. I fell in love with the Nintendo DS at first play and still adore it to this day. I purchased the PSP without expecting too much out of it and ended up being pleasantly surprised and loving the system in earnest. The Vita went from being an afterthought purchase to being one of my favourite systems of all times, and my love for it keeps growing by the game.The only exception to that list of gaming bliss is the Nintendo 3ds, which has the dubious honour of being the only system ever that I started loving before growing to somehow dislike it. I wouldn't step as far as to claim that I hate the 3ds, but thinking of that system definitely generates mixed feelings in me and leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I was well inclined towards it at first, due to the DS legacy and to the Gameboy one to a lesser extent, and my first experiences with it were pleasant enough to make me love it. I thought this was the beginning of yet another long and fruitious gaming love story; however, that dreamy scenario was not meant to be. Instead of getting stronger over time, my initial love for the 3ds slowly but surely crumbled as I had to endure one hurdle after the other at the hands of Nintendo. Their questionable policies and decisions regarding the 3ds are partly to blame for my disaffection with the system, along with other factors that I will now expose in all their unholy glory. Without further ado, here come the lovekillers:—The cursed region lock: This is the original sin and the major flaw of the 3ds, and it's simply impossible to avoid mentioning it. Nintendo's decision to implement region lock on one of its handhelds for the first time in its history was both an incredibly retrograde move and a giant diss to collectors all around the globe. It's safe to say that the region lock significantly reduced my emotional investment in the 3ds: it's a teeny-weeny bit hard to grow attached to a system when you need three different versions of it to play all the games released worldwide. And of course, it should surprise no one that the region lock also reduced my financial investment in the 3ds. If not for this aggravating flaw, I would certainly have imported Japanese special editions of the 3ds as well as Japanese games by now; yet I didn't, and I most certainly never will. Having to purchase a North-American 3ds to play the handful of games that didn't make it to Europe was already galling enough, and there's no way I will waste money to buy a third iteration of that collector-unfriendly system. —Model and iteration galore: Talking about iterations of the 3ds, there are definitely too many of them. 3ds, 3ds XL, 2ds, New 3ds, New 3ds XL: that's five iterations so far, and that's a couple too many. Granted, the DS had four iterations; but the original DS was short-lived and the DSi XL came very late in the console's lifetime, so it never felt like we were drowning under DS models. The five iterations of the 3ds, on the other hand, were released in rapid succession and are all currently cohabitating in shops, which complicates matters when it comes to electing one. To add to the confusion, Nintendo is continuously swarming the market with countless special editions of every single iteration. Multiply this by the three regions, and you get a collector's nightmare. This overabundance of 3ds models jumps way beyond the stimulating mark and lands right into the \"too much of a good thing\" and \"mental overload\" territory. —Gimmickry overload: We're talking first and foremost about the ill-fated 3D, which was supposed to be the system's highest selling point—before turning into a total fiasco. Nintendo's obsession with 3D, which can be traced all the way back to the '90S, could have been deemed visionary if not for the debacle of the whole 3D gimmick. That fad went out of fashion nearly as soon as it was launched, and the 3ds suffered greatly from that fall from grace. Few developers nowadays even bother implementing 3D in their 3ds games, and those that do often blotch it horribly. Add to this the fact that the 3D is not tolerated by everyone, and you get a crappy gimmick that Nintendo should have ditched for good twenty years ago. Heck, wasn't the debacle of the Virtual Boy an ominous enough sign that going 3D was not a good gaming gimmick? But wait, we are not done yet with the gimmickry overload. Enter the New 3ds cover plates, a gimmick as costly as it is pointless and a shameless attack on Nintendo fans' wallets. Sure, no one actually forces me to buy these cover plates; but they cheapen the overall image of the system, and I'd prefer to see Nintendo put their energy into producing new games rather than useless pieces of plastic. It's also worth noting that many so-called 'special editions' of the New 3ds are nothing more than regular New 3ds with cover plates slapped on them, which is just the cheapest trick ever. As a collector, I'm not buying this—literally.—The missing games: Let's face it, the 3ds library sorely lacks RPGs. Even the most die-hard fans of the system can hardly deny the fact that the 3ds cannot hold a candle to the DS in that regard and that its RPG library only amounts to a fraction of the DS one. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg. Upon closer inspection, it turns out that the 3ds lack games in general. It lacks new exciting franchises and it lacks new exciting entries in old franchises. It lacks fresh games that are not hommages (read \"rip-off\"), remakes or ports of games from older generations. Take the Pokemon series: only two brand-new instalments in four years, along two remakes. The Zelda series: only two brand-new instalments that were conceived as \"spiritual successors\" to older entries, accompanied by two ports. Etrian Odyssey: only one new entry—yet two remakes. Shin Megami Tensei: one new entry vs. three remakes/ports. Rune Factory and Kingdom Hearts: one lone entry each. The list goes on and on, and there is worse: series and subseries that didn't get a single new instalment on the 3ds. Like Sonic Rush, Golden Sun, Advance Wars, Suikoden, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, Luminous Arc and probably more that I cannot remember right now. Fresh and exciting new franchises bristling with ideas are also sorely missed, and the few 3ds games that could have been franchise founders fared badly: unless I'm sorely mistaken, Hometown Story, Sonic Boom and Lord of Magna won't be the foundation stones of solid and successful series. To make matters worse, the overall release pace of 3ds games is tepid, as though developing games for the system were a monumental task requiring years of work. Well, allow me to doubt that. —Lack of visual flair: For some unfathomable reason, developers seem to have collectively decided to stick to a single visual style for their 3ds games. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about: said style involves faux-3D sprites and environments, garish colours, kawaisa by the truckload and overall visual cluttering. So many games sport that style—from Pokemon to Moco Moco Friends to Fantasy Life and many, many more—that it would be faster to point out the precious few games that do not sport it, such as Rune Factory 4 or Senran Kagura Burst. This visual uniformity is more than a trifle boring, and I wish developers could take a page from the DS' book—which offers every type of stylization under the gaming sun, from 16bit-ish pixel galore to decent attempts at photorealism—and make their games more visually varied. If the DS could pull it off, then certainly the more powerful 3ds can do it too. All these flaws have tainted my relationship with the 3ds, possibly forever. Although I will keep pinning for new exciting RPGs and will more or less support the 3ds until the end of its tenure, that system will go down in my personal gaming history as a mixed bag of a console that frustrated and delighted me in equal measure. Yet since I'm an eternal optimist, I keep hoping that some great games will be released by the end of the 3ds' life. A batch of titles with cult-classic potential could certainly go a long way towards rekindling my love for the system, and the release schedule for 2016 looks promising enough to make me want to spend hours glued to my 3ds again. Let's wait and hope! I'd be curious to know if some of you experienced a similar dissatisfaction with the 3ds and curious to know your feelings about that handheld in general, so feel free to let me know in the comments! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Dungeon Travelers 2: A potpourri of goodness", "date": "20/12/2015", "text": "35 hours into DT2 and still loving it just as much as when I started it. More so, in fact. My lone Valkyrie has hit the Lv.75 mark and keeps gaining levels at a jolly good speed, and unless I'm sorely mistaken, the end is drawing near. Whether I will hit the Lv.99 mark before the final boss remains to be seen, as well as whether or not the game has some extra postgame dungeons in store.But we're not there yet, and for the time being, I want to elaborate on all the goodness packed by DT2. This game has tons of excellent features, from the most minute ones to the most playthrough-altering ones, and I'm now going to enumerate the ones that charmed me the most all in a long, exhaustive—and somewhat haphazard—list. Hail now the amazing goodness potpourri of DT2!The dungeon design is deliciously clever and challenging. Of the three first-person dungeon crawlers I've played so far, DT2 sports by far the most interesting and engrossing dungeons. The game uses a batch of tried-and-tested level design tricks such as invisible passageways, oneway walls, warps, pits, dark areas and stairs and combine them in various ways to great effect. Each dungeon is given its specific brand of level design and its exclusive combination of gimmicks, and the roaming and exploration remain constantly fresh and compelling as a result. The Giant Tree of Tver, for instance, hosts no empty spaces at all; so one can look actively for invisible passageways leading to hidden chambers. Another good point is the originality of the dungeons' themes; although the game starts off with a very classic cave-themed dungeon, it later veers away from established formulas by offering dungeons as pleasantly unexpected as a villa, an onsen and a library. The art style is gorgeous and the character designs are pure eye-candy. Granted, the dungeons themselves look rather bland and generic, but their lack of aesthetic flair is more than compensated by the gorgeous looks of the characters, friends as well as foes. All the party members—including male lead Fried—are handsome, ooze charisma and are dressed to kill to boot, with several costume variations that all look amazing. As for the foes, they are divided into two categories: incredibly cute non-human foes such as fruits and cats and delightfully alluring monsters looking like young women in bloom, and they are all a pleasure to look at and fight. Although a couple of colour palette swaps can be spotted every now and then, the variety of enemy designs is staggering and one can rest assured that they will encounter brand-new foes in every dungeon. Cherry on the cake, the soundtrack is upbeat and pleasant to the ear, with a distinctive '80s vibe that is unusual for the genre yet quite enjoyable. The game is choke-full with humour. Self-derisive comments, hilarious dialogues, breakings of the fourth wall, tutorials that poke fun at every cliché under the RPG sun and funnily awkward situations, DT2 has them all in spades and is undoubtedly one of the most witty and humourous games I've played in a long time. I certainly didn't expect that and was more than pleasantly surprised, finding myself giggling and grinning on a regular basis as I played. Heck, even enemies are smiling as though they're having all the fun in the world! There are excellent incentives to grind senselessly. Not only do defeated foes drop tons of very decent pieces of gears and other useful items, but they can also be transformed into so-called \"Seal Books\". These books can then be sold for good money, equipped to grant passive stat bonuses and used to enhance equipment, making DT2 the kind of game in which one does not ever run away from random battles. The class system is incredibly deep and fulfilling. It's basically a copy-paste of Seiken Densetsu 3's branching class system, minus the stone-praying and item-collecting parts, and it allows for an amazing amount of fine-tuning and experimentation with the party. Each class has its own unique abilities and its own combination of strengths and weaknesses—completed with an exclusive outfit that remains judiciously hidden until said class is chosen. Although I'm deeply enjoying my solo run, I nearly regret not having played with a full party just for the pleasure of discovering more classes. Cherry on the cake, the abilities granted by a class are saved when moving on to the next class in line, meaning that a party member will de facto master three classes at once after hitting the second class change mark at Lv.30. Talk about cumulative benefits!DT2 offers a lot of excellent and challenging side dishes to take an occasional break from the main quest. Exclusive bonus dungeons can be unlocked and the main dungeons feature restricted areas that can be accessed later in the game. Exploring new dungeons and revisiting old ones is already fulfilling enough in its own right, and the exercise is made even more enthralling by the presence of ludicrously strong bonus bosses that will very likely obliterate the party in a couple of turns when faced for the first time. Of course, this is bound to change as time goes and XP accumulates, and being finally able to pummel to death a bonus boss that was impassable a couple of hours before is undoubtedly one of the finest satisfactions offered by DT2. It makes you feel that you're progressing in a very palpable way that stats and levels alone could definitely not evince. The side quests come with yummy benefits. Sure, they seem utterly generic and boring at first sight, since they consist exclusively of farming quests that require to kill x enemies or to gather y items; however, the pay-off for completing these quests amply justify tackling them despite their bland nature. Some of these quests grant keys to access locked parts of main dungeons as well as exclusive rare items, and clearing a certain number of quests will unlock new extra dungeons as well as increase the capacity of the inventory. Knowing that the quests always involve enemies or items that are available in the currently explored dungeon or in the next one in line, there are definitely no reasons to bypass this insipid yet painless way to reap benefits. Last but not least, DT2 sports plenty of little features that make the gameplay more enjoyable. Customizable speed for roaming and fighting, itinerant shops in dungeons, instant save feature, free resting, forging system with variable results that can be exploited to one's advantage, good modern auto-drawing maps and plenty more. I could keep raving forever about the excellency of DT2, but all good things must come to an end, including this post. I'm far from being done with writing about that game though, and you can expect more posts about it very soon. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Comme ci comme ca: 2015's most disappointing games", "date": "13/12/2015", "text": "I was initially planning to write a top 5 of my favourite games for 2015, but I quickly realized that it wouldn't work out. 2015 has been an amazing gaming year for me, each game being as excellent as the one that preceeded it, and picking up only five entries was purely and simply impossible. On the other hand, I've played a couple of tepid games that somehow soiled my perfect gaming resume for the year, and I thought that it would be more interesting to mention them—all the more so as I didn't cover them all here. Assume thus that I adored every single game I played this year, bar these ones!—Steins;Gate (Vita): I've written more than enough about my experience with that game, so I won't elaborate excessively. Suffice it to say that as far as I'm concerned, this acclaimed visual novel didn't live up to its potential and ditched a perfectly good story to indulge in mostly nonsensical romantic meanderings.—Xenoblade Chronicles 3D (3ds): Once again, I won't babble inordinately about this one since I already wrote a post about it. The little I've played was dull, tedious and utterly forgettable. Definitely a waste of good money. —Kirby Triple Deluxe (3ds): I played it this summer, but the review was unfortunately lost in my schedule issues of August. Although that game was incredibly pleasant to play, offering excellent gimmicks and a lot of giddy fun, it was also painfully shallow and forgettable. I like to compare it to cotton candy: fluffy, sugary and heart-warming, yet leaving no taste on the palate and forgotten as soon as swallowed. I was also not too fond of the recycling of gameplay elements, which seems to have become Nintendo's trademark of late: some gimmicks and bosses in Kirby Triple Deluxe were already present in 1992's Kirby's Dream Land for the Gameboy—which, en passant, is the only other entry of the series I've played. Frankly, I expected more evolution and novelty from 23 years of Kirby games; but maybe I'm just being too exigeant. Oh, well.—Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate (3ds): My short-lived playthrough of this game actually started auspiciously. I was totally fond of the colourful aesthetics and gorgeous vistas and I lapped up the amazing physics so much that I went out of my way to kill extra monsters during the tutorial missions; and, last but not least, I was totally delighted by the presence of all these adorable anthropomorphic cats. Unfortunately, all crumbled down as I cleared the tutorial missions and was thrown into the game per se. The overwhelming number of weapons to choose from paralysed me, and my first weapon tutorial was such a clunky, unsatisfying mess that I gave up on the spot and beat a hasty retreat. Maybe I'll try my hand at it later, if I manage to steel myself enough to stomach the overabundance of equipment.—Fantasy Life (3ds): On paper, this game had everything to delight me: colourful and stylized art style, gentle and welcoming atmosphere and quests by the truckload. However, once I started playing it, I found it curiously vapid and empty. It was not horrible by any means, just uneventful and not exactly compelling. I gave up after a couple of hours because I simply didn't care anymore. In my opinion, this game lacks a backbone, a driving force that could motivate players to play. It's nearly more of a \"concept\" game, an attempt at creating the ultimate blend of RPG and life sim; however, the result feels artificial, contrived and ultimately shallow. I'll give it another try later, though; maybe I was simply not in the right mood when I played it.That's four 3ds games, and let's be honest: they played their part in my recent disaffection with the handheld. They are not the only culprits, of course; but four so-so games for one single system in one year weigh heavily, especially when played in rapid succession. I'm pretty confident that I will soon get some quality material to help me recover from this 3ds trauma, though: early 2016 is packed with mouth-watering 3ds releases—which will soon be featured in my next list of coveted games. Overall, 2015 was a stellar gaming year, and I fervently hope that 2016 will be just as excellent. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "PSN: A rant (a.k.a. those quantic digital games that are yours, yet not yours)", "date": "06/12/2015", "text": "I've just made the most unpleasant discovery regarding games downloaded through the Playstation Store, a discovery that made me hiss and spit like an angry cat. Having to fork out a ludicrous amount of money to obtain proprietary Vita memory cards was not enough, oh no; dear ol' Sony had to design extra limitations to prevent us from using the content that we legally bought.Here's the situation: I am a collector of both games and gaming systems. As a result, I currently own five Vitas in various colours, with the plan of using some of them as backups when my oldest Vitas start dying on me. I always assumed that all the games I downloaded from the Playstation Store could be played at will on any of my precious Vitas; but lately, as I learnt that only two Vitas could be registered on the PSN, a sliver of doubt regarding that assumption wormed its way into my mind. Before I knew it, said sliver of doubt had expanded to massive proportions, to the point where I felt obliged to run a test in order to dispel or confirm my suspicions. I took one of my brand-new Vitas out of its box, stuck a memory card loaded with games into it and booted the system. A couple of minutes later, my horrendous suspicions were confirmed: I cannot access the content of the memory card at all unless the hosting Vita is registered in the PSN.I'm absolutely livid, and royally pissed off. This basically means that I cannot play the games I bought on the systems I bought on my own terms and have instead to endure Sony's arbirtrary limitations. Sure, I can register and unregister Vitas at will on the PSN, but why do I have to do that at all? Why can't I register as many Vita as I want on the PSN? And most importantly, why do the memory cards need to be used with a system tied to a PSN account in the first place? I bought these games, damnit, and I should be allowed to play them on any system I want once they are safely tucked away on a memory card.This point matters to me as a collector, because one of the main reasons why I collect is perennity. I collect games and systems so that I can replay them to my heart's content as time goes on, and these hidden PSN rules put this plan in jeopardy. It's pretty safe to assume that the PSN won't be around forever, and I'm asking: what will happen to my downloaded games when the PSN is taken down? Will they become totally unplayable? Maybe Sony will come with a fix to allow PSN users to keep on playing the games they bought, but maybe they won't. This means that I paid for products that may one day become unusable, and this is NOT what I signed for. Nintendo got a lot of criticism for their unpractical policy of forcing Nintendo Eshop users to have their account tied to a single system, but these policies of Sony are just as bad. They are actually even worse, because Sony doesn't deliver clear information on the matter and let people make assumptions that are ultimately untrue—such as the perfectly reasonable assumption that purchased digital games are yours to use as you want on any system you want, now and forever.I was already not in favour of digital games, and this discovery makes me dislike them even more. From that point on, I will:a) Ponder very carefully every digital purchase and proceed only if the concerned game is not available physically at all and if there is a discount on it.b) Get my act together and step up my game by diving back full force into my long-forsaken Japanese studies. This endeavour is long overdue, and now I have more incentive than ever to undertake it. Once I know enough Japanese, I can purchase the Japanese physical editions of all these games that are released only digitally in the West and stop worrying about the perennity of my games.Although I'm furious about this whole mess, I'm also glad that I made this discovery. Being aware of these hidden limitations regarding digital games will spare me some uninformed purchases and help me save some money in the long run, and hopefully it will help other gamers do the same. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Dungeon Travelers 2: The importance of running solo", "date": "02/12/2015", "text": "Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is the definite discovery of a new favourite RPG subgenre. I started Dungeon Travelers 2 a couple of days ago and I've been as intensely glued to it as I've been glued to Class of Heroes and to Demon Gaze not so long ago. At that point, it's safe to assume that I do love first-person dungeon crawlers indeed, and quite passionately at that.I've been tinkering quite a lot with the game, starting it with a duo run starring Alisia and Melvy. The two were introduced together and I had to clear a dungeon floor with both of them before I was granted the option to alter the composition of my party; as a result, I grew attached to them both and simply couldn't choose between these two lovely ladies when I got the opportunity to do so. Not running solo when it is actually possible is a most unusual move for me, and this could have been my first ever duo run in a dungeon crawler if not for one single element: the chanting time, i.e. the time needed to cast spells. The cursed, horrendous chanting time, which made fighting with Melvy an absolute chore instead of the blast it should have been. Not only does the chanting time delay the unleashing of Melvy's spells, sometimes by a full turn, but any hit endured by Melvy while chanting can cancel the spell altogether. I found this gameplay mechanic extremely awkward and unfilfilling, to the point where the idea of putting up with it any longer simply became unbearable. That's when I decided to wipe the slate clean and to restart from scratch, this time following my good old solo ways.Since I wanted Melvy out of the picture, my DT2 solo run became automatically synonymous with an Alisia solo run. Any other character would have joined the fray way too late to stockpile the necessary XP for a smooth solo run, and I was not in the mood to attempt a duo run with any of them, so Alisia alone it was. This solo run became a complete dream run as soon as it started: since DT2 is the kind of game in which the amount of XP is equally divided between party members, I was gaining levels literally twice as fast with Alisia alone than with Melvy and Alisia. It took me a mere five hours to reach Lv. 15 and the first class change: presented with a choice between evolving into a Berseker and a Paladin, I wisely chose the latter. My reasoning was that as a solo act, I needed to become my own private tank and to build up defense abilities good enough to be able to sustain many blows in battle, and the Paladin seemed a better choice to achieve that goal than the Berserker, who was very likely all about attack to the detriment of defense. This choice proved fruitful and I kept rampaging through dungeons, taking one boss after the other without breaking a sweat.After another five hours, I reached Lv. 30 and the second class change; that's when, unbeknownst to me, I made a fatal mistake by choosing the Samurai instead of the Valkyrie. I was lured into the Samurai way by the prospect of being able to use Katana attacks that could strike a whole row of enemies—a technic that seemed tailor-made for a solo run. Alas, this seemingly promising class change didn't produce the expected goodness and turned out to be quite underwhelming instead. For one thing, Katanas are quite rare and often weaker than your average sword, so the attacks targeting whole rows of foes didn't exactly deal an staggering amount of damage. For another, Samurais cannot use Lances and Axes, which are the strongest weapons in the game, and have to content themselves with weaker Swords and even weaker Katanas. Last but not least, the Samurai's defense abilities are simply not solid enough to guarantee a smooth solo run. I suddenly found myself struggling quite a lot during random battles, and gaining levels as fast as ever didn't alleviate my struggling.After some unsatisfying trudging and plodding, I took the ominous decision to reset my level to 30 and to switch to the Valkyrie class. That meant giving up a handful of levels—I had reached Lv.37 at that point—and putting up with a healthy dose of level-grinding in order to regain my edge over foes, but I was more than ready to make that sacrifice for the sake of a better gameplay experience. And a better gameplay experience was most likely to be around the corner, since the Valkyrie had a)a better defense than the Samurai, b)the ability to use Swords, Lances and Axes, and c)powerful Lance attacks that could target several enemies at once. And thus I proceeded with that run-altering class change, with an ever-so-slight touch of trepidation and anticipation.To my utter delight, my first steps as a Valkyrie showed a change for the better. Despite losing seven levels in the process, I immediately noticed that random battles were easier and smoother, and they became all the more so as I level-grinded dutifully and regained my lost levels before marching on. Since then, my run has regained its dreamy quality: I'm progressing unhindered, taking down minions and bosses along the way and gaining levels at the speed of light, and I'm enjoying every minute of it.When it comes to assessing the solo run-friendliness of DT2, I can safely assert that this game does indeed accommodate a solo run quite leniently... Providing that you make the right choices, that is. The only viable way to progress smoothly as a lone ranger in DT2 is to choose Alisia as your one and only and to make her evolve first into a Paladin, then into a Valkyrie; deviate a trifle from that path, and your sleek solo run will turn into a trudge before you can say \"oops, wrong class!\" Given the sometimes insane difficulty of the game, I suspect that wrong choices in a solo endeavour may even leave one completely stranded and forced to reset levels like I did, or even to restart from scratch.And talking about the difficulty of the game, this is a subject I will cover in my next post about DT2, along with other points not directly related to the solo side of my run. I am far from being done with that wonderful game, both in playing and in writing! Until my next post, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon-Explorers of Sky: Final thoughts", "date": "25/11/2015", "text": "After roughly 19 hours of play, I am finally done with Explorers of Sky. I didn't fully explore the vast postgame territory as I initially planned, quitting instead in the early stages of Zero Isle. Although my postgame endeavours had started well with a quick and nice exploration of Mystifying Forest, things got rougher as I started progressing through the North part of Zero Isle. Traps were overabundant, ennemies were powerful and, cherry on top of the tediousness cake, I was not gaining levels anymore. After 15 floors, I also started suspecting that Zero Isle would be a ridiculously huge dungeon; a quick research on the internet confirmed that hunch, which turned out to be the proverbial last straw that prompted me to stop playing. I don't want my warm feelings about that game to be spoiled by a frustrating trudge through punishing dungeons, so I'll wisely abstain from clearing the rest of the postgame content altogether.I'll abstain all the more so as I already had my share of fun while clearing the main game. I certainly got much more enjoyment out of Explorers of Sky than I had bargained for: I initially only wanted to get over my grudge and give another chance to the DS instalments of the series, yet I ended up loving Explorers of Sky even more than Gates to Infinity. Here's a list of all the features that made this game so pleasant to me:—The story was excellent and told in a very convincing way. From the mundane beginnings to the unexpected plot twist, followed by the sudden discovery of higher stakes and crowned by a sweet emotional ending, the pacing was pitch-perfect. Talking about the emotional ending, I shed a tear or two while witnessing it, and I'd wager that I'm not the only one. Cutscenes were a precious few and judiciously dispatched while avoiding dialogue overdose, making for a pleasantly compact and streamlined storytelling that never treaded on the gameplay's territory. —The crawling was pure pleasure thanks to a winning combination of good dungeon design, lovely graphics and stellar music. Although the dungeon design of Explorers of Sky cannot be described as truly clever or excellent because of its randomized nature, it was still quite palatable: dungeons sported a reasonable size, with an average floor size that gave room for exploration without being overwhelming and a decent number of floors, and many dungeon layouts displayed patterns that could be used to streamline the crawling. The graphics were definitely finer than in Blue Rescue Team, with a abundance of exquisite details that made every dungeon unique. Last but not least, the crawling was crowned by a stellar soundtrack comprised of dozens of beautiful and complex themes that caressed the ear without ever becoming irritating. —Spinda's Juice Bar, a.k.a. Drinking with benefits. This was the single most awesome feature of Explorers of Sky, as it offered the possibility to raise stats without level-grinding. Just give Spinda all the gummies you put your paws on, and voilà! IQ increase for you, as well an extra point of Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack or Sp. Defense for each Gummi drink polished off. Even better, maps of extra dungeons can be found occasionally at the bottom of your empty glass; that's a lame explaination allright, but the outcome is certainly fantastic. I found two such maps, namely of dungeons called Serenity River and Lush Prairie; I obviously explored them, and was rewarded by a couple of boxes full of items on the last floor. All this awesomeness made me completely addicted to Spinda's Juice Bar, and it was not long before I found myself frenetically collecting Gummies in dungeons and buying all the ones available in Kecleon shop before drinking them all at Spinda's—rinse and repeat. Thanks to that juice abuse, I became massively overleveled and didn't encounter any difficulty during the boss fights—including the last one, which I wrapped up in a couple of turns. Juices are a Pokemon's best friend!—The overall atmosphere was really lovely and soothing. I love mellow games that are welcoming to the player and make them feel at home, and Explorers of Sky was exactly that. This kind of sweet atmosphere was what I initially expected to find in the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series and failed to feel in Blue Rescue Team, so I'm glad I could feel it in Explorers of Sky. The settings were so enchanting that I even felt a bout of that gaming fernweh I already mentioned in my post about Astonishia Story: I wanted to be there, to explore that world myself instead of gazing at it on my DS screen.And since I'm mentioning my DS screen, I can also say that Explorers of Sky reignited my love for the Nintendo DS and reminded me how much I actually fancy that system and its special brand of gaming. DS games have a visual style, a sound, an overall atmosphere that are unique and instantly recognizable and that I absolutely adore. I have somehow deserted my DSi these last months to concentrate on my Vita, but I feel now that it is time to lavish some love on it again. I have literally dozens of DS games to play yet, and I could use some positive Nintendo-related experiences after my recent disappointments with the 3ds. So until my next DS game, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Amnesia:Memories: The Joker Route (SPOILERS!)", "date": "21/11/2015", "text": "Fifth and last route, folks! The Joker Route was my second favourite after the Diamond Route and an interesting conclusion to the overarching storyline of Amnesia:Memories. Orion's initial collision with my character's brain was justified in a rather convincing way, as well as all of Ukyo's seemingly random actions and weird declarations in the four other routes. If not for the uncanny amount of babbling and superfluous rehashing of the other routes' themes (I was vomiting the whole \"childhood friends/big brother\" drill with Toma and Shin at that point, I swear), the Joker Route could actually have been my favourite route of the whole game. Oh, well.My exploration of the Joker Route led me first to its ridiculously numerous bad endings. We're talking about seven bad endings there, people, and I uncovered all of them first thing. Six of them belong to the 'branching path' category and can be smelled from afar; of course, I had to see what they had in store for me, and I jumped into the lion's den with some giddy masochistic satisfaction. Oh, the fun of being killed in a million different ways! I was murdered by Ukyo, kidnapped by Toma, crushed to death, burned alive and so on, in a deliciously gruesome display of bad luck. The seventh bad ending is tied to the Parameters and happens if the Trust and Affection Gauge are not filled enough after the other six bad endings have been successfully dodged. This was the last bad ending I uncovered; and after witnessing that most entertaining collection of grisly outcomes, I started hunting for the better endings in earnest.During my first 'bad endings special' run, I had tried my hardest to convey my love to Ukyo and had been very demonstrative to him, forcing my attentions and my presence on him as much as the dialogue choices allowed me to do, only to get stranded in the ultimate seventh bad ending after dodging the other six. I then started a second run in which I tried to be more compliant and to go along with Ukyo's wishes. His main demand throughout the whole route was that I kept my distance from him, and I did exactly that while still being kind to him when we interacted. This behaviour paid off and I was rewarded by the normal ending, leaving me just one ending away from sweet, sweet completion.I must insert a disclaimer here; although I unearthed that ultimate good ending all by myself, I have to admit that I didn't manage to pinpoint the exact requirements for uncovering it. My winning strategy involved uncovering all the memories from other worlds involving Ukyo and dodging the memories from the Joker Route involving anybody else while simultaneously trying to max up the Trust and Affection Gauges. My reasoning was that if I managed to avoid all memories of the Joker world until the scripted event that would trigger the memory of my encounter with Ukyo in that world, then Orion would not separate from me and would be able to save the day, leading me straight to the good ending. It turned out that this reasoning was unvalid and that Orion being kicked out of my consciousness was actually a scripted event as well; yet my strategy ultimately paid off and generated the good ending. Since I had reached completion at long last, I didn't play a test run in which I could have checked the validity of my hypothesis regarding the requirements for the good ending, for instance by triggering memories of the Joker world involving other persons than Ukyo. That is why to this day, I don't know if the good ending is tied to the Parameters, to the recovering of the memories of Ukyo from other worlds or to a mix of both. Well, that question will have to linger unanswered until my next playthrough of Amnesia:Memories.If there is a next playthrough, that is. Although I will certainly not erase the game now that I've forked out some cold hard cash to purchase it, the inherent lack of replay value of visual novels may prevent me from ever replaying it. That doesn't diminish the game's merits in any way, though: this was an excellent gameplay experience and a really fun ride. I've been pondering whether or not Amnesia: Memories was intended as a deadpan parody of otome games. The game's assiduity when it comes to offering bad endings by the truckload and its zeal to craft entirely unlikeable bachelors—well-intentioned guys treating you like shit or psychos treating you amorously, pick your poison!—certainly comes across as humorous, but that may just be my own penchant for dark humour and satire speaking. At any rate, I want to play more visual novels with an otome flavour, which is why I ordered Norn9: Var Commons and Code:Realize just after clearing Amnesia:Memories. If you know other good visual novels with an otome touch, feel free to fill me in! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Amnesia:Memories: The Diamond Route (SPOILERS!)", "date": "17/11/2015", "text": "Oh what a ride! Let's be blunt: when it comes to all things narrative, the Diamond Route was my favourite of them all. I dreaded playing it at first, yet I needed not. It offered me an amazing piece of storytelling that blended claustrophobia, suspense and emotion in equal parts and ended up being deeply engrossing and moving. This route's exclusive focus on interactions between Toma and my character was enthralling, and a welcome change from all the mundane chit-chat with secondary characters I had to tolerate in all the other routes. Once again, the outcomes of the Diamond Route were tied to my behaviour in an utterly logical way. Although Toma's actions are obviously designed to elicit a modicum—or an abundance—of suspicion and uneasiness, it is up to the player to decide whether they trust him against all odds or not. If the player treats Toma like the creep he seems to be and vent their hatred and contempt towards him, little Toma will go over the edge and start acting like a psychopath in earnest. This will lead straight into the open arms of the \"We'll be together forever\" ending, which is without a doubt the most gruesome and disturbing ending of the whole game. If the player decides to trust Ukyo upon a chance meeting instead of sticking with Toma, they will be killed once again in the \"I'll take you with me\" bad ending. On the other hand, should the player decide to give Toma the benefit of the doubt and show a modicum of kindness towards him, they will manage to escape mostly unscathed through the normal ending. Last but not least, if the player decides to trust Toma with their guts and to show some unwavering love and kindness towards him, they will be rewarded with a blooming love story in the good ending. I really liked the grittiness of that outcome: both Toma and the main character are obviously volatile people that have been nurturing a totally unhealthy fusional relationship for years, but they admit that much and decide to live with it. Their story of mutual unrequited love was actually quite touching, all the more so as unlike the other bachelors, Toma bottles up his feelings until the very end. It's pretty obvious from the start that he loves you, yet he won't bring himself to admit it, and that makes his final confession in the good ending all the more precious and moving.I lapped up the Diamond Route allright, but that doesn't mean that I deem it perfect. I have a serious gripe with it, and that gripe is related to the existence of an extra Parameter Gauge that is exclusive to that route. This gauge measures a parameter called 'Doubt', a confusing name with an inherent ambiguity that prevented me from uncovering the good ending on my own. When I discovered that gauge, I automatically assumed that it was supposed to measure my suspicions regarding Toma's creepiness and that I had to keep it to a minimum while maxing up the Trust and Affection Gauges if I wanted to unearth the good ending. Unfortunately, it didn't work; and after several failed tries, I capitulated and resorted to following an FAQ. As I was progressing, I checked the Parameters and was utterly shocked to see that the Doubt Gauge steadily filled up along the Trust and Affection Gauges, until all three were nearly full at the end of the run. That's when I realized that my initial assumption had been erroneous and that the Doubt Gauge was actually measuring my suspicions regarding the fact that Toma was in love with me despite faking the opposite. Really, game? How was I supposed to assume that? Sure, I could have guessed it, given that the gauge filled up every time a telltale event revealing Toma's buried feelings for me occurred; but I have to admit that it was a trifle too far-fetched for me. Sure, I could have tried to max up the Doubt Gauge when I saw that keeping it to a minimum didn't yield the good ending; but it didn't dawn on me, so sure was I to be on the right track. This will remain my biggest regret regarding the Diamond Route; to uncover the good ending all by myself at the end of that favourite route of mine would have been the cherry on top of the cake. Oh, well.Next and last is my report on the Joker Route, and then I'll be done with Amnesia Memories. Until that final post, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Amnesia:Memories: The Clover Route (SPOILERS!)", "date": "13/11/2015", "text": "Here comes my report about Amnesia:Memories' third route, fellow gamers! Things started off nicely, as my first run of that route landed me the normal ending. I was not going to stop at that, obviously, and started a second run during which I once again closely monitored the Parameter Gauges in order to fill up the Affection and Trust Gauge and keep the Suspicion Gauge to a minimum. This micromanagement paid off beautifully and I uncovered the Good Ending, to my immense satisfaction. It feels intensely rewarding to be able to unearth good endings all by myself without resorting to FAQs, and I commend Amnesia:Memories for offering endings that are not so ridiculously arcane that they cannot be uncovered without help. (I'm looking your way, true ending of Steins;Gate.) After that, I started a third route in which I tried to be odious to Kent for a change. This produced the \"Isn't it a beautiful night?\" bad ending, in which I was murdered again by Ukyo. It's worth nothing that the Clover Route is the only route that doesn't contain any 'branching path' ending, every ending in this route being generated solely by variations of the parameters. When it came to unlocking the second bad ending and last ending of the route, I suddenly grew bored of tinkering with said parameters and resorted to an FAQ for the first time since I started playing the game, which allowed me to witness the rather chilling outcome of being locked up in a ward at Kent's instigation, probably for life. In terms of parameters, this ending pops up when the Suspicion Gauge is filled up while the Affection and Trust Gauge remain low—in other words, when you're cold to Kent while behaving in a highly suspicious manner. And that, folk, was the gist of my exploration of the Clover Route.Although I had some decent fun while clearing it, I was a trifle disappointed by this route. My main gripe is that unlike the Heart and Spade Routes, the Clover Route doesn't offer the merest shred of a clue to help the player figure out which memories they are still missing. These missing memories could be absolutely anything at all for all the player's knowledge, which forbids any kind of speculation and kills the suspense before it can even be born. Things get even worse when said missing memories are finally revealed, because the plot twist they introduce can only be described as weak at best. Learning that Toma had attacked me in the Heart Route and that Ikki was the unwitting victim of some kind of creepy love trafficking in the Spade Route had some interesting shock value, but the sudden revelation that I had been in love with Kent all along and that I was actually referring to him when I told him about my heartbreak came accross as inane and maudlin. The whole route came across as inane and maudlin, if I have to be totally honest: it solely revolved about my totally unfascinating and awkward love story with Kent, conveniently sprinkled with pieces of cheap sentimentalism such as the episode with the dog. My character was also considerably more passive and whingeing than in the other routes and Kent managed to come across as ruder, duller and more annoyingly overbearing than Shin and Ikki combined, which is quite the feat. I started feeling some lassitude after my third run, hence the use of an FAQ to unlock the last bad ending—which I wanted to witness, yet not enough to risk failed runs by searching for it myself. That's all for the Clover Route, fellow gamers! I'll see you soon with a post about the Diamond Route. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon-Explorers of Sky: Sweet slow burner", "date": "11/11/2015", "text": "I don't like harbouring gaming grudges, all the more so if said grudge is against a game belonging to a genre I favour and if that game happens to be a spin-off of one of my favourite series. I wrote off the DS entries of the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series after a disappointing experience with Blue Rescue Team, promising myself never to touch them again; but now, one and a half year later, I felt that it was time to give the DS branch of the series another chance and to try my hardest to get over that saddening grudge. I had been toying with the idea for some time and had purchased a copy of Explorers of Sky, thinking that it would be better to start again with a brand-new entry; and lately, a review of that game on The Lucky Critical gave me the boost I needed to start playing it in earnest.And so did I. The opening quiz produced Pikachu—to my mild surprise, since I had tried hard to obtain that Pokemon in Blue Rescue Team and failed entirely. I had already played as Pikachu in my run of Gates to Infinity and wanted to try out another 'Mon, so I took the quiz a second time... And landed Pikachu again, to my utter surprise. Well, I guess it was destiny! I thus went with Pikachu and selected Skitty as my partner, because hey, I just cannot resist cats. Especially if they're kittens. I decided from the get-go that this would be a duo run because a) I didn't feel like levelling up other 'Mons and b) The Lucky Critical's review had conveniently revealed that the last dungeon had to be tackled with your partner only, so better get used to it right away! And so, I dove into action with that colourful fury duo. After 14 hours of said action, I am literally glued to Explorers of Sky and loving it more by the hour. I certainly didn't expect that in the beginning, given how slow and unimpressive were the early stages of the game. I was not allowed to tackle more than one mission at once, which was annoying as my greatest desire was to Crawl'n'Grind. Each mission was preceded and followed by unskippable cutscenes taking place at the Guild; and although these scenes were kind of cute and helped establish a sense of belonging to the Guild, they became irritating after a while. There was an annoying mini-game that further ruined the already slow pacing, and the story consisted of fending off the attempts at stealing food perpetrated by a team of cartoonish ruffians. All that was rather vapid, and although the game was much more pleasant than Blue Rescue Team, I was not exactly glued to it. I would play only once in a while, clearing a mission or two before closing my DS and diving back into Demon Gaze.Fortunately, this lukewarm gameplay experience was not meant to last. After a couple of hours, the story suddenly took a most interesting turn thanks to some unexpected developments, gaining a much broader scope in the process; and to my utter delight, the dungeon crawling followed suit. My crawling horizons were suddenly expanded to massive proportions, as I could tackle as many missions and dungeons as I wanted and Crawl'n'Grind to my heart's content. And Crawl'n'Grind I did, clearing all the Dojo's dungeons and tons of missions. Oh, the delight! Once I was sated, I dove back into the story, without forgetting to take a break every now and then to grind and farm useful items. After several hours of that regimen, I'm totally and desperately hooked on Explorers of Sky: although I'm nearly at the Final Boss' door, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the game. I want to keep gorging on crawling and grinding until I get my fill of it, and something tells me that these urges will not be sated after beating the final boss. Which is for the best, given that the game goes on after that. More crawling, yes please!Of course, it certainly doesn't hurt either that the game looks and sounds amazing. This is a late-era DS game, and it show beautifully: the colours are splendid, the graphics bristle with exquisite details and the 'Mons detailed animations are absolutely adorable. There is a staggering graphical gap between that game and Blue Rescue Team, and it's all for the best given how primitive the latter was in that department. As for the soundtrack, it is a pure piece of ear candy with dozens of tracks in various styles, most of them being considerably more complex than what you'd expect to find in a Pokemon spin-off aimed mainly at kids. Although I'm not done yet with my playthrough, I can safely say that the DS branch of the series has totally and beautifully redeemed itself thanks to Explorers of Sky. It has done so to such extent that I'm even considering giving another try to Blue Rescue Team, the game that started the grudge in the first place. Or former grudge, should I say, because this is now a thing of the past. The present is all about playing Explorers of Sky and enjoying it to the fullest, and you can expect more writing about that game before I'm done with it—and after, for that matter. Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Amnesia:Memories: The Spade Route (SPOILERS!)", "date": "09/11/2015", "text": "Although I've not been writing about Amnesia:Memories this week, I've been glued to it and managed to polish off the four main routes already. This game is getting more engrossing by the route, and I will most certainly miss it once I clear the Joker Route, which I'm currently exploring. But we're not there yet. For now, let's concentrate on Ikki!The Spade Route was quite different from the Heart Route in terms of narrative logic. Unlike the Heart Route, the Spade Route didn't offer me an enormous and conveniently obvious clue on a silver plate to let me know what memories I was missing and how to retrieve them. Ikki was also significantly harder to decode than Shin, and his feelings and intentions toward me were murkier. As a result, my first run ended up on two of the three bad endings, which was not exactly encouraging. This opening run led me first to the \"I'll get rid of those who hurt you\" ending. This is a 'branching path' type of ending that is triggered by a single answer, regardless of everything that happened before, so it's actually quite easy to avoid once you know the crucial dialogue choice leading there. Since I didn't know, I fell prey to that ending and had to joy of witnessing my own demise at the hands of Ikki's crazy fan club members. My, what a chilling outcome! I was expecting to be murdered by Ukyo again, so this came as a total surprise. How many psychopaths are hovering around me, exactly? Anyway, I reloaded my last save file presto and kept playing, and unearthed the \"I wanted us to live together\" ending at the end of that first playthrough. Not too surprising, given that I had been instinctively odious to Ikki from the get-go. Still, getting two bad endings in a row stung a bit. But I was not going to give up, oh no. I stood up, brushed myself off and started a second run in which I tried my hardest to be nice to Ikki. My efforts paid off and I unearthed the normal ending. Victory! Well, not quite. To be honest, I really couldn't fathom what memories I was still missing, let alone how to reclaim them. The only vague clues I had were the message about a report that was sent to me early on, Ikki's proposition to live together and that mysterious three-months deadline. No matter how I tried to piece these elements together, that was not enough to give me a clear idea of what I was supposed to do to get the much-coveted good ending.I thus decided to resort to a different tactic, namely to monitor the parameter gauges closely and use them to guide me. This hadn't been necessary in the Heart Route because the logic there was so blatantly obvious, but this extra help was now becoming mandatory. My goal was to keep the Suspicion Gauge at its lowest while trying to max up the Affection and Trust Gauges, and I engaged in a assiduous micro-management campaign in which I saved before every dialogue choice, picked an answer and checked the gauges afterwards to see their evolution. I then loaded my save file, picked the other available answer(s) and checked the gauges again, and then loaded my save file again and selected the answer that had wielded the best result in terms of parameter increase. That may sound utterly boring, but it was actually immensely fun. I was surprised more than once by the 'best' choices, and was surprised even more when I finally discovered the ultimate plot twist of the Spade Route as the result of all my hard work. Gee, I knew that this mysterious message about a report was important! This was the prelude to the good ending, which saw me move together with Ikki while getting partially rid of the fan club clique. Only partially, mind you, because they are still hovering around him like hungry vultures around carrion. I guess nothing is ever perfect, in otome games like in the real world! Oh, well. Elated and enboldened by this resounding success, I decided to hunt for the last ending of the Spade Route, namely the \"Not bad, God\" bad ending. Since rebuffing Ikki had led me to one ending already, I figured out that the requirements for getting the third bad ending had to be different, and my guess was that they revolved around the Suspicion Gauge. I had tried my hardest not to rouse suspicions about my amnesia during my previous runs; but this time around, I went for suspect behaviour full force and gave entirely dubious answers that made the Suspicion Gauge burst at the seams. The result was drastic: Ikki confronted me about my conduct, and went in a rage upon learning that I had not confided in him despite having amnesia. He sprouted a bunch of lies and threatened me before chasing me out of his room, and that was the end of both our relation and the run. Third bad ending successfully uncovered!Since I was at it, I decided to uncover the second bad ending of the Heart Route. I though that being cold to both Shin and Toma would do the trick, but to my utter surprise, this behaviour generated the normal ending again. This unexpected outcome led me to the conclusion that I had to be cold to Shin and nice to Toma all the way in order to get that second bad ending. This was the only combination I had not tried, so it had to be the winning one, right? Well, I was not disappointed: it was the winning combination allright, and it led me to be murdered. By Toma. Seriously, game? I don't mind being murdered by random psychos like Rika or Ukyo, but always-nice, always-smiling big-brotherly Toma? That came as a shock, honestly. And indeed, it turns out that this adorable guy is actually the creepiest creep of them all—but more on that later. Suffice it to say that after witnessing that ending, I started having serious reservations about the Diamond route. That's all for the Spade Route, fellow gamers! It was a challenging and fun route despite Ikki's irritating behaviour. I'll see you soon with my report about the Clover Route. Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Demon Gaze: Ce n'est qu'un au revoir", "date": "06/11/2015", "text": "Now is the time to craft my ultimate post about Demon Gaze, before other dungeon crawlers take the scene. I'll keep it neat and nice, with a digest of my run followed by a list of the points that charmed me the most and a list of the points that moderately annoyed me and that I would love to see corrected in an hypothetical sequel. Without further ado, here are my final thoughts about Demon Gaze!So, here's my run in a nutshell. I played for 38 hours, which is quite a reasonable amount of time for a dungeon crawler, and reached Lv. 72. I stuck to the same three Artifacts the whole time, namely Counter, Killer Edge and Slash (1 then 2), as they were perfectly fit for a solo run; the last two slots accommodated whichever extra Artifact I found, although none of them stuck for long. My favourite and most used demons were Mars, Chronos, Venus and Neptune; I occasionally cruised around with Comet, Hermes, Uranus and Pluto and never touched Jupiter and Astro. I obtained very few pieces of gear, usually sticking to the same ones for hours on end; this occasionally created slight unbalance problems, as I found myself overpowered by enemies because of my outdated equipment. I farmed gear very seldom and never needed to grind for money since I was playing solo; I level-grinded only twice, namely before the very first and the very last boss fight of the main game. And that, fellow gamers, is the gist of my run. Now let's move on to the good and not-so-good points of Demon Gaze! The excellent:I won't elaborate further on the lovely atmosphere, the solo run-friendliness and the awesome roaming since I already covered them in my first post. Instead, here are the new positive points that I discovered since: The fan-service is pleasantly varied, catering to every potential audience in equal measure. There's plenty of bare skin, bosoms and revealing outfits, both on males and females. Shotacon and lolicon adepts should be most fond of Lulu, Kukure and Prometh, while the yaoi crew will lap up Cassel and Lezerem's constant bickering and sentences such as Astro's \"Take me with those eyes\"—addressed to the main character in a deep, nearly sultry voice, of course. Yuri aficionados are not forgotten and get a pleasant treat with Pinay's hilarious obsession with Fran. It's nice to find such an open-minded stance about fan-service, and the pervasive humour at work in the game makes that inclusive brand of fan-service even more palatable. The boss fights are totally awesome, period. For a more elaborate take on the matter, check out my boss run posts here, there and there.Instead of getting steadily larger, the dungeons inflate and deflate at random throughout the game. The largest and trickiest dungeon of the main game, Grimodar Castle, is located at the halfway mark, while the last and second-last dungeon are even tinier than the very first one, and in-between can be found dungeons of all sizes. This variety keeps the crawling fresh and interesting and injects a modicum of pacing into it. Cherry on the cake, the dungeons always remain easy to navigate and don't overuse cheap traps and tricks to disorient the player and increase the game's longevity.The soundtrack is pure ear-candy—to the point that I was just that close to purchasing the special edition of the game for the OST only. A special mention to the theme track of Fall Palace, a.k.a. \"Eden of the Monarch\". These choirs!! This orgel!! Oh, the delight!! This track is the epitome of grandeur and one of the best pieces of music I've ever heard in a video game, period.  The demons ooze charisma, so much so that I grew seriously attached to them. I really appreciate that so much effort was put into designing their looks, clothing, attitudes and speech patterns, making them sparkling and magnetic despite the fact that they are not even animated. Cherry on the cake, the voice acting is absolutely stellar, and I couldn't get enough of my demon foils' babbling. And it certainly doesn't hurt that they shine in battle and grant so many passive abilities, now does it? They are simply awesome, and I wouldn't be surprised if I miss them when playing my next first-person dungeon crawler. The romance with Fran was heart-warming and refreshing—just like the rest of the story. I half-feared that Fran would turn out to be the Real Final Boss in disguise, but these fears were unfounded; instead, I got a lovely \"let's live together at the Inn forever!\" ending that warmed my soft gamer's heart. The \"could have been a trifle better\":I was none too pleased with the fact that the best gear had to be farmed in Demon Circles, preferably with Increase, Strenghten and Gold/Silver/Bronze gems. Regular monster drops are few and far between and mediocre for the most part and the selection available at the Inn is absolutely pitiful, which means that farming is not an option but rather the only way to get something valuable; and to be honest, I resented that. I love grinding, yet I dislike farming; and I would definitely have preferred to grind for money in order to buy ludicrously expensive yet powerful pieces of gear in Cassel's shop rather than to try my luck in Demon Circles and manically reload my save file until I got a good drop. I'm not saying it's an horrible system per se, mind you; it just didn't click with me.The Ether Forge was an awesome idea, but why put limitations on the strengthening? And why are these limitations totally random? It doesn't make sense that some pieces of gear can be strenghtened up to Lv.30 while others can only reach Lv.10. I would have preferred to have access to unlimited strengthening, be it against a hefty sum of money. The Treasure Maps were an great idea on paper, but the execution was flawed. Each individual map occupies one of the 99 available item slots in the inventory, so carrying these maps around at all times quickly becomes impossible; and once they are tucked away in the Inn's Storage, it's all too easy to forget about them entirely. It certainly doesn't help that most of them refer to places that belong to postgame territory and that they don't mention the name of the dungeon itself, but rather the name of the dungeon subsection where the item can be found, which forces the potential treasure hunter to do a lot of scanning and double-checking. Add to this the fact that the obtained treasures are items rather than pieces of gear and you'll understand why, as my run went on, I got into the habit of selling these maps as soon as I came back from roaming.Only three Demon Slots, no matter how much you level up. That's plain stingy, game! Instant deaths because my \"weakness was exploited\", as the game kindly puts it. And no, Poinee Dolls don't work in such instances—tried and tested. Now that's plain cheap, game! Well, well. That's all about Demon Gaze for the time being, but I'm far from being done with that game. I loved it with a passion and still do, and I can assert with absolute certainty that this precious cartridge will grace my Vita slot again. And now, on to the next first-person dungeon crawler! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Amnesia:Memories: Auspicious start", "date": "01/11/2015", "text": "Let me tell you this: Amnesia:Memories may be the first otome game I've ever played, but it certainly won't be the last. Because to my utter surprise and delight, I'm enjoying that game much more than I thought I would. Heck, I'm relishing every minute of it!Interestingly, what fascinates and enthralls me so much in that game is not the romance side or the cast of bachelors. The romance is both utterly cliché and too twisted to feel rewarding, and the potential sweethearts are downright unlikeable, so these blooming relationships don't make my heart flutter in the slightest. What rivets me and glues me to my Vita screen is the challenge set by the game, which is none other than to try my hardest to figure out how to get all the available endings.Unlike Steins;Gate, Amnesia:Memories sports a solid dose of logic when it comes to narrative developments. It is actually possible to determine which course of action must be followed in order to get a given ending, and bad endings can be smelled from afar. Likewise, it is pretty easy to figure out which dialogues are relevant to the plot and which ones are idle babbling that won't alter the course of events. The gauges that can be found in the \"Parameters\" options of the menu also help tremendously as they allow a close monitoring of the consequences of dialogue choices, as well as the fact that already chosen dialogues options are highlighted in subsequent reruns. Using all these clues as well as rational thinking, I cleared the Heart Route and managed to unearth the good end and the normal end as well as one of the two bad endings all by myself, and I'm quite proud of that feat. (SPOILERS ahead!)That being said, I have to admit that the game fooled me allright at first and managed to lure me in the wrong direction in a most masterful way. I was introduced to Shin, who also happened to be a first-class prick, and it was pretty obvious that I was going to dislike him at first sight and clash vigorously with him. I suspected him of being involved in my accident and thus gave him the cold shoulder while being friendly with Toma during the first half of my run. I then realized that maybe Shin was not guilty after all and started being nicer to him, but the damage was already done and I got the normal ending as a result. I love how utterly logical this outcome is in the context of the story: I was being nice to Toma and colder to Shin, which obviously meant that I liked the former and didn't the latter that much; and thus, it made perfect sense that I would repress the memory of Toma attacking me because of my affection for him and wouldn't be motivated to remember said memory because my love for Shin was not strong enough to endure the pain of facing the fact that Toma attacked me. From there, I deduced that the way to get the good ending probably involved being as nice as possible to Shin and as distant as possible towards Toma; this would thus mean that I liked the former and felt disconnected from the latter enough to face the harsh truth and remember the accident, and I applied this reasoning in a fresh run of the Heart Route. This proved highly successful, as I uncovered the good ending at the end of that run. Victory! I also managed to nail down the \"I'm not the culprit\" bad end, which was, well, bad in an almost hilarious way. And talking about that end, I have the feeling that this Ukyo is fishy. What's with all this talk about me getting along with my friends no matter how we are involved together? Could Ukyo be a spirit able to navigate between worlds, just like Orion? Well, I guess I'll find out sooner or later. I still have one bad ending left on the Heart Route, and if my reasoning is correct, I should manage to unearth it if I give the cold shower to Shin all the way through, which I plan to try at some point. For now, on to the next one!On a more general note, I wonder if unlikeable sweethearts and over-complicated relationships are a staple in otome games or if they are specific to Amnesia:Memories. The path to love is sure full of landmines in that game, and it felt a bit galling to work so hard to earn the affection of a douchebag who doesn't even seem to care that much about my transparent, uncharismatic character. If not for the challenge of trying to figure out how to regain my precious memories—i.e. how to get the good end and beat the game—I think I wouldn't bother playing the game at all. But fortunately, the challenge is there, and I'm lapping it up. Brace yourself, Ikki, I'm preying on you next! Until my next report on the matter, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Demon Gaze: Boss rush, solo style (3)", "date": "28/10/2015", "text": "Here come the third part of my Boss rush, fellow crawlers! Once again, that's four new bosses for the road—including none other than the final boss of the main game. Yes folks, we're already there! Just like in my former post, there is a modicum of spoilers involved. Without further ado, here are the dishes of the day!—Uranus: Light demon Uranus boasts excellent defense and stellar healing abilities, along with the ability to generate several rows of protective seeds at once. Regular hits from both Uranus and the seeds can Silence the party, so using buffs and any other spells in that fight is entirely out of the question—at least when playing solo. Winning this fight required four attempts and a fair bit of tinkering on my part. A first attempt with Chronos, Neptune and Mars as my open demon failed as Mars was taken down in a couple of turns. I then decided to exploit Uranus' weakness, namely the fact that just like Astro and Venus, she can only summon a given number of rows of seeds, after which she's left seedless and defenseless. My strategy was thus to cast Heal Shower 2 at the beginning of the fight and team with Chronos to get rid of all the seeds, after which I would open Mars and enrage her to get rid of Uranus quickly and neatly. Things started well, but unfortunately, the Demon Gauge emptied before I could get rid of the seeds, sending Chronos into Rage Mode and obliterating my strategy in the process, since enraged Chronos did not hit hard enough to counteract Uranus' abundant healing. I made a third attempt in which I tried to get rid of the seeds all by myself, and was pummeled to death despite the Heal Shower since every single blow from Uranus and the seeds was aimed at me. My fourth and last attempt reprised the strategy of my second attempt, only with a closer monitoring of the Demon Gauge. I closed Chronos as soon as the gauge reached the 30 mark and finished the seeds myself, then opened Mars and enraged her. Even with enraged Mars by my side, it took a fair amount of turns to get rid of Uranus because of her high defense and regular healing, but we finally managed it. This fight really forced me to devise a tailor-made strategy, and it ended up being all the more satisfying.—Pluto: Darkness demon Pluto is all about spells, instant deaths and debuffs. She doesn't hit that hard, but she uses the Demon Gaze attack as well as the Demon Vase, which means that Heal Shower is basically useless in that fight. Knowing that, I went at her with Venus and Chronos to reduce spell damage and Mars as my open demon. We proceeded to get rid of the seeds as usual, which was done rather quickly since defense is not Pluto's strongest suit, after which I enraged Mars and we pummeled Pluto into submission in a couple of turns. This actually happened during my second try; on my first attempt, Pluto killed me on the spot by \"exploiting my weakness\", as the game puts it. Still, this was a rather easy and straightforward fight, preceeded by an incredibly small dungeon. After the enormousness of dungeons such as Grimodar Castle and Endless Road, finding a dungeon as tiny as King's Court was most refreshing and relaxing.—Ether Mirage: Just like Astarte before her, Ether Mirage has the potential to be incredibly tedious despite not being a main demon. She has no seeds, she doesn't hit hard at all and she cannot use major debuffs, and yet she can be literally impossible to eliminate without the right strategy. The issue at work here is that Ether Mirage has stellar defense and amazing healing abilities and can use Divine Armor to boost her already high defense stats; this can lead to a situation where the damage dealt to her is not high enough to counteract her ridiculously good healing, making her de facto impossible to beat. My strategy to overcome that hurdle involved taking along both Uranus and Mars to boost my hit power as well as Chronos to take care of my defense. I opened Mars and enraged her from the very first turn, and then proceeded to use Concentrate and Jupiter Bane to dish out a maximum amount of damage, all the while using Demon Vases to counteract Ether Mirage's Divine Armour when necessary. This strategy paid off nicely, as I finally got rid of Ether Mirage after a couple of turns of intense fighting.  —Sol: This is the last fight of the main game, the epic showdown we've been waiting for since first setting foot in the Inn. And it was also by far the cheapest, most infuriating fight of the whole game as far as I my run was concerned. How come, you may ask? Well, unlike the fights that preceded it, this ultimate fight against Sol is all based on strength and luck. Forget about perfect demon settings and fine-tuned strategies: the only thing that matters against Sol is to inflict a maximum amount of damage, preferably in a minimum amount of time. Sol is basically all the demons rolled up together in one nasty package, and instead of summoning seeds, she summons copies of the demons—which means that you can find yourself literally fighting two bosses at once, if not three or four. The game pits you first against Luna as an introductory fight, and getting rid of her is easy enough with enraged Mars and Concentrate; however, things get nastier after that, when the game introduces you to Sol without any complimentary healing or refilling of the Demon Gauge. After twelve failed attempts to beat Sol, I had to admit that I was simply not strong enough to perform the deed. I kept being killed on the spot, knocked out and pummeled to death, or Sol summoned demons faster than Mars and me could eliminate them, or whatever else, but there was always something preventing me from winning. I retreated, grinded for two hours with Mars, Chronos and Venus—who were my demons of choice for that fight, en passant—and came back with a handful of extra levels for both my demon foils and myself and a longer Demon Gauge. The third try of that second assault finally brought me the long-awaited victory against Sol and an immense relief to be done with that fight at long last.I was none too pleased with that last fight, honestly. On one hand, it makes perfect sense that Sol was stronger and nastier than the rest of the demons, and I admit that I would have been disappointed if she had yielded as fast as, say, Venus or Pluto; on the other hand, making her so massively overpowered, to the point where level-grinding was mandatory to beat her, was a bit of a cheap trick. The importance given to the luck factor in that fight was also quite infuriating. Although luck plays a part in all boss fights in Demon Gaze and can help the player secure a faster victory, the fight against Sol required luck to be won at all, even with the adequate level of strength. It was a meaty and thrilling fight against a formidable opponent all right, but it was also cheap and underhand. Oh, well.This post marks the end of my boss rush, as well as the end of my run for the time being. I was firmly set on exploring every single post-game dungeon and started roaming the Black Cage as soon as the credits were over, but I stumbled on a massive roadblock that stopped my progression dead as surely as empty batteries. That roadblock is none other than demon Aries, who I cannot beat for the life of me. I tried to do so seven times so far, and she insta-killed me every single time by exploiting my weakness. Every single time. And we're talking about the first encounter with her in a circle, not the real boss fight against her! I guess I could keep trying until I get a stroke of luck, or I could get some better gear and artifacts, or even grind to raise my pitiful Luck stats—and maybe I will indeed do all that after a while; but for the time being, I've stopped playing Demon Gaze. I cleared the main game and thus feel that I have done my gaming duty; and although exploring post-game dungeons is undoubtedly tempting, I have to admit that I lost my drive ever-so-slightly after seeing the credits roll. Oh, well. I still want to explore dungeons though, probably more than ever. Fortunately, Moe Chronicles and Dungeon Travelers 2 are right at hand to satisfy my roaming urges, and one of them will become my next first-person dungeon crawler very soon. I'm not done with Demon Gaze though, at least in writing: I will craft a last post to sum up my feelings about the game, and hopefully more if I pick it up again and make my way through postgame territory. Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's delight: A most divine edition", "date": "24/10/2015", "text": "In the wake of my recent purchase of the FFCC: Echoes of Time DSi, I started hunting for other interesting editions of the system. To my surprise, there are actually not so many of them, and it seems that the DSi cannot hold a candle to the New 3ds when it comes to swarming the market with countless special editions—judging whether this is a good or a bad thing is left to everyone's discretion. At any rate, it turned out that only one edition of the system was gorgeous enough to capture my eye, namely the SaGa 2 special edition that had already been on my radar for quite some time. The Kingdom Hearts edition turned out to be too Disney-ish for my taste upon close inspection, and the Ace Attorney edition looks plain weird and doesn't please my retinas in the slightest. I already own the Pokemon White edition, so this SaGa 2 DSi that I snatched for a very fair price may well be the last special edition of the DSi that I purchase. Anyway, behold the gorgeousness of that piece of kit!It comes packed with the game, which I would have LOVED to see localized. Not that this will stop me from playing it sooner or later, mind you; I loved the Gameboy version so much that not playing this remake is simply unthinkable. The console itself looks amazing with its hamonious colour palette and its blend of matte and glossy textures.While I'm at it, I may as well mention two other collecting-oriented purchases I've made lately, starting with the limited physical edition of Ar Nosurge Plus. I was patiently waiting for a discount on that game on the PSN store when I learnt that limited physical copies of the game had been pressed for the North-American market. I knew right away that I needed one of these, and a couple of days later, a brand-new copy had joined my collection.Although I'm delighted to own a physical copy of such a major release (Vita-wise, that is), I'm none too pleased with the goodies that came packed with the game. We're talking about a pin badge, a cleaning cloth, a poster and a sticker sheet, all things entirely useless that won't bring a thing to the gameplay experience and are nothing but cheap items to boot. This is the typical example of a half-hearted attempt at putting together a special edition: instead of going for it full force and crafting a valuable package with useful and gorgeous feelies that could enhance the whole gameplay experience and strengthen the player's love for the game, the publisher threw in a handful of trinkets sporting the game's colours to justify a higher price tag and make it look like they were selling something more valuable than the game and its box alone. Well, the trick didn't work with me, and I would have preferred either the game alone with no bibelots or a full-blown special edition with strategy guide, soundtrack and the like. Oh, well.Last but not least, here is my brand-new Asian copy of Moe Chronicle! I had written this kinky first-person dungeon crawler off as a distant dream that could never be played, until I learnt about Asian editions sporting english and the possibility to order such editions from Play-Asia. Next thing I knew, the game had joined my precious collection, ready to be played and enjoyed to the fullest.This was my first purchase ever from Play-Asia, but it certainly won't be the last—all the more so as these excellent sellers were kind enough to include a discount coupon in the parcel, despite the fact that I was a brand-new customer. Now that's what I called stellar business practices! I was already planning to buy more games from them, but this unexpected kind gesture motivates me to do so even more.That's all for the time being! Since I love Demon Gaze so much, I was just that close to ordering the special edition of that game, but I managed to restrain myself. I already own a physical copy of the game, after all, and the goodies are not that great anyway. There are enough games waiting to be purchased not to waste my money on purchasing games that I already own! As for future purchases, there is not much on my radar right now. The special editions of the New 3ds slated for release until Christmas could have interested me if not for my dwindling love for the system, so the only 'special' I'm looking forward to getting my paws on is the Lionheart Edition of Trails of Cold Steel, which packs a yummy-looking artbook for a price hardly higher than the price of game alone. I am so getting it, I am! Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Demon Gaze: Boss rush, solo style (2)", "date": "18/10/2015", "text": "Here's the sequel to my boss rush, fellow gamers! (Spoilers are included, so reader discretion is advised.) That's four new boss fights for the road, fights that were mostly cinches but interesting and entertaining nonetheless. Things are getting a trifle more complex, to my utter delight: it is now mandatory to consider carefully which demons must be taken along in battles, and I found myself using a buff for the first time in my playthrough. Without further ado, enjoy the plats du jour!  —Venus: Beauty demon Venus is the undisputed queen of status effect spells, as well as an excellent healer with sky-high agility that allows her to escape blows more often than not. She is also the first demon that summons several rows of protective seeds at once, so actually landing a hit on her is a rare and elusive feat. Despite these hindrances, I managed to beat her on my first try, and quite promptly at that. I had determined during my first encounter with her that her physical attacks only slightly dented my HP bar; my strategy was thus to cast Heal Shower 2 at the beginning of the fight to take care of healing matters, and then to open Mars and to use my newly gained Slash 2 skill to dispose of the numerous rows of seeds. However, things didn't go exactly as planned: Venus repeteadly Confused and Poisoned me, preventing me from attacking the seeds—or herself, for that matter. Mars was left shouldering the important task of disposing of the seeds, and although she was doing a great job at it, she was also suffering a lot of damage in the process, and I feared that she would pass out before the end of the fight. That wasn't meant to be, though. What happened instead was that the Demon Gauge fell down to zero, sending Mars into Rage Mode with a refilled HP bar. I feared this would seal the end of the fight if Mars ever hit me, which she obviously did; but to my utter surprise, blows from enraged Mars only ate a fraction of my HP—nothing that the Heal Shower couldn't take care of. Mars then turned her ire towards Venus, who was fortunately left seedless at that very moment, and proceeded to pummel her into oblivion with massive blows that took away up to 3000 HP. Poor Venus didn't stand a chance and passed out before she could even heal or summon a row of seeds. The process took no more than two or three turns, leaving me gaping at the screen in sheer incredulity—like, is it over already? Although I'm not too proud of my minor involvement in this fight—Mars basically did all the job while I was frenetically gobbling Antidotes—at least it was a sleek and smooth affair that hardly made me sweat.—Astro: The 'magical maijin' and second male demon of the game is basically the king of all things spells. He also has stellar healing abilities, and just like Venus, he can generate several rows of seeds to protect himself. Worse, these seeds can heal themselves and heal him as well. And yet, Astro was even easier to beat than Venus, despite the fact that I had virtually no abilities at hand to protect myself from his spells. My only option to reduce spell damage was to set Venus as a passive demon, along with Chronos, and hope for the best. Mars was my open demon of choice for this battle, and together we did a great job getting rid of the seeds. Then, as soon as Astro was left seedless, I decided to reproduce the trick that had proved so successful during my fight with Venus, only in a more controlled way. I thus unleashed the Demon Rage skill to send Mars into rage mode, after which she basically pummeled Astro to death in a couple of turns. Neat and easy fight, in which everything went according to plan. Next please! —Lord Shark: As I foreboded, I had to dispose of the misnamed Lord Shark, who turned out to be a replica on steroids of the Skull Lord in terms of fighting tactics. He churned out a new row of minions nearly every turn, so I decided to focus solely on him while letting my demon foil doing whatever they saw fit. Emboldened by my easy fight with Astro, I decided to experiment a little bit and summoned Venus to fight alongside me; unfortunately, she passed out after a couple of turns, pummeled into oblivion by the many rows of rays. I then summoned Mars, who did a great job at eliminating these pests while I was focusing on Lord Shark. He passed out eventually, leaving us free to dispose of the remaining rows of minions. That was another easy fight, despite the small mishap with Venus, and I didn't even have to use the Demon Rage skill.—Luna: The Clock Tower fight with Luna, that is. My first brawl with her in Red City was hardly memorable, since it was over in two turns; however, this second encounter stung a bit harder. My first two tries were massive failures: I went into battle with Chronos and Venus as passive demons and Mars as my open demon, only to get wiped out after a mere couple of turns, pummeled into oblivion by the massive blows of Luna and her seeds. Luna hit like a BEAST, and so did her seeds, while my own attacks dealt little damage, taking no more than 80-100 HP from them. Since newly enrolled Astro can boost spell power, I started fearing that maybe Luna was nearly immune to physical attacks and could only be taken down with spells, which would have put me in a serious bind. But before jumping to conclusions and starting to despair, I made a third attempt at beating her, with Neptune as a passive demon instead of Venus. I cast Heal Shower 2 as soon as the fight started, then Multi-hit on myself and Mars; then, as soon as Luna was seedless, I unleashed the Demon Rage skill once again. This was too much for Luna, who admitted defeat and retreated after two turns—or was it one?—spent enduring Mars' hugely damaging blows. I'm not done with Luna, of course, and I guess I will have to dispose of her for good later. On a more general note, I don't know what to think of that fight. My first two tries and the third one were so drastically different that I have a hard time figuring out if Luna was a tough cookie or not. Could there actually be some kind of perfect strategy for each and every boss fight, a flawless combination of passive and active demons, buffs, gear and attack patterns that would ensure an easy victory? That would explain why some players struggle with some bosses while other players have it easy. I'm even more smitten with Demon Gaze's boss fights now that their deeply strategic quality is slowly revealing itself, and this gives me a lot of confidence for the fights to come.My boss rush stops here for now, as I have only two more demons to enroll and a handful of dungeons left to explore. The Dungeon—Venus' hideout, that it—was rather refreshing, while Endless Road was a bit of a hassle due to all the backtracking involved and the fact that some parts of the dungeon had to be accessed through hidden doors located in nondescript areas. I think I will start having Comet with me while exploring dungeons for the first time, because re-examining every wall to find hidden doors is a huge pain in the butt, especially since dungeons keep getting larger. I wish the game would stop being stingy and grant me a fourth Demon slot; I'm at Lv. 51 now, and I feel that I deserve a more substantial reward for my dutiful leveling-up than the regular stats and HP increase. And since I'm mentioning this, I discovered lately that increasing the Vitality stat when gaining a level gives much more HP than increasing any of the other stats. Lovely! The story is taking a more sinister turn, as Lulu implied that something nasty would happen to me after I enroll all the demons and that Fran knew about it. That pint-sized traitor may be lying, but she may be telling the truth. I'm getting wary of Fran—who indeed turned out to be a dragon!—since she steadily refuses to answer my questions regarding Lulu's claims and deviously pretends to be angry at me and sulking to avoid talking to me. Oh, well; I'll find out the truth sooner or later, I guess. And now... On to the next dungeon! Brace yourselves, Uranus and Pluto—and whoever else dare standing in my way! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Demon Gaze: Boss rush, solo style (1)", "date": "14/10/2015", "text": "Let's have a nice little Boss Rush, fellow gamers! Whilst the boss fights in Demon Gaze are not wildly original and don't really revolutionize the exercise, they are still interesting enough to make me want to write about them. They present an gripping variety of challenges that call for different strategies, and they keep things interesting by offering various difficulty levels throughout the game: instead of getting steadily harder and harder, bosses go from tough-as-nails to piece-of-cake to tough-as-nails again and so on, in an endless wave of difficulty fluctuation. I hadn't had that much fun fighting bosses since Criminal Girls, and I'm lapping up every single fight, even the toughest ones. Especially the toughest ones.Since I'm playing solo, it is pretty much mandatory to fight bosses with an open demon by my side—so you can expect a major focus on the demonic side of boss-killing strategy, so to speak. I'll skip the first fight with Comet, since she is basically a warm-up boss, and jump straight to the main courses. Bon appétit!—Mars: Despite being only the first real boss of the game, fire demon Mars is quite a tough cookie. She has incredibly high attack, which put me in serious trouble given my weak level at this early point in the game, and I had to endure a solid amount of level-grinding to even stand a chance against her. Once I reached a decent level, beating her mostly boiled down to luck and good timing. With Comet healing me at the right moment and my attacks landing successfully, I finally managed to pummel her into submission after a couple of infructuous tries.—Chronos: Earth demon Chronos is the polar opposite of Mars: while Mars is all about high attack, Chronos boasts sky-high defense and a vertiginous amount of HP. On the other hand, she is quite slow and she doesn't strike hard enough to require regular healing from Comet, so my winning strategy was to invoke Mars and to attack Chronos relentlessly while enduring her not-too-threatening blows and healing when necessary. This is actually a rather easy fight that provides a welcome respite after the red-hot struggle against Mars. —Hermes: The first male demon of the roster ramped up the difficulty again. As the resident wind demon, he boasts high speed and agility that allow him to attack first, strike twice every turn and evade your blows with an irritating regularity. He is quite weak, both in terms of attack and defense, but has great accuracy and debuffs than reduce agility and evasion. The biggest risk during that fight is to see your blows go down the drain while Hermes and his seeds pummel you to death. The best way to deal with that slippery demon is to dispose of the seeds swiftly in order to land as many hits as possible on Hermes himself—the more powerful the hits, the better. After failing to beat him with both Comet and Chronos, I finally managed to take him down neatly with Mars by my side.—The Mimic: Beating that boss is a matter of levels over strategy. Although he's available early on, the story requires him to be defeated only after Hermes is added to the roster, and his levels are in keeping with that timeline. I tried to tackle him before his time was due and failed miserably, but took him down without breaking a sweat after I captured Hermes. I teamed up with Mars to get rid of the Mimic's hindering veins (yes, veins) faster and took him down switftly and neatly.—Neptune: Water demon Neptune is not much when it comes to attack and defense, but she has stellar healing abilities as well as a good range of status effect attacks. Still, she's significantly easier to beat than Hermes—that is, if you don't make the fatal mistake of fighting her with Mars by your side like I did at first. Since fire is weak against water, Neptune and her seeds can take Mars down in two turns—literally—while not suffering any sort of significant damage. For my second try, I teamed up with Hermes and things became much smoother, and it wasn't long before Neptune was added to my roster of demons.—Astarte: My, this was a wake-up call boss if there ever was one. Astarte looked innocuous at first, with her sprite hardly bigger than a regular foe sprite and the absence of any minor foe to fight alongside her, but she was one nasty, hellish proposition. For one thing, you must have a demon by your side at all times, because Astarte has an attack that will ultimately kill you if there is no demon to intercept it. Astarte can also modify the party's formation, cast debuffs and status effect spells and hit rather hard as a whole—not to mention that she gets to move twice every turn and can land several blows with each attack. As though this were not enough, she has sky-high evasion as well as excellent healing abilities. In a nutshell, she's HARD. I needed no less than five tries to beat her, and managed to do so only by focusing heavily on healing. On top of having Neptune by my side, I stocked a couple of Full Healers that proved very useful when I was dangerously close to death and not sure Neptune could heal me in time and enough to keep going. It's also worth noting that Astarte is the first boss that forced me to pay close attention to the passive stats bonuses granted by demons and to choose very carefully whom I was taking into battle with me, as I quickly found out that I didn't even stand a chance without the attack and defense boosts provided by Mars and Chronos. After that, it was a matter of keeping an eye on my health while attacking relentlessly. Neptune did an amazing job at healing me and curing me of status effects when I needed it; and since she can also heal herself, she managed to maintain her HP at its fullest and to stand by my side throughout the whole fight. Even with this winning battle configuration, defeating Astarte was a long and arduous affair: it took me a good ten to fifteen minutes to eradicate her, which is much longer than the other boss fights—all that in order to defeat a minion that didn't even join my roster of demons. Wake-up call boss in all its glory, folks.—Skull Lord: Strategy is crucial with this one. Although the Skull Lord cannot hold a candle to Astarte when it comes to sheer difficulty and nastiness, I found out the hard way that a bad start in this fight can smother any chance of winning it in the long run. Having a good stock of Dolls to endure attacks in your place as well as weapons with an anti-undead effect is highly recommended, as well as having Neptune by your side and a couple of Full Healers in your bag. Once the fight starts, it is vital to ignore the rows of minor foes and to concentrate on the Skull Lord in order to take it down as fast as possible. Left alive too long, the Skull Lord will generate rows upon rows of minions that will attack relentlessly and eat away the party's HP. My winning strategy was to use a powerful two-handed Lance of the Dead +10 found in Grimodar Castle on the Skull Lord, ditching a portion of my defense in the process, and to switch back to my usual one-handed weapon+shield set to get rid of the rest of the minions once their master was disposed of. With Neptune's diligent ministrations to keep me perked up, the second-hardest boss fight of Grimodar Castle was soon done with neatly and swiftly.—Jupiter: For all her taunting and graphic death threats, Jupiter was by far the easiest boss in Grimodar Castle. The hardest part of the fight was actually to chase after her, first in the Treasury and then in the Clock Tower; once I had her cornered, she hardly opposed any resistance and yielded much faster than Astarte or even the Skull Lord. Did I mention that I managed to defeat her on my very first try? That's how much of a breather she is, and a most welcome one after the odiousness of her two predecessors. Jupiter has average stats except for her high accuracy, and her healing ability is so pitiful that it's hardly worth mentioning; as a result, I'm pretty confident that she could be taken down with any demon without too much hassle, although I didn't get the opportunity to tinker much with strategy against her. I teamed up with Neptune and the whole fight went quite smoothly; the only real issue I encountered was the complete depletion of the Demon Gauge at some point in the fight. That was the first time this ever happened, and since I was not closely monitoring the gauge, I have no clue about why or how it did happen. I remember being vaguely aware that Neptune was regularly using several moves in a row during that fight, so my best guess is that she simply emptied the gauge faster than it could refill. Anyway, enraged Neptune was kind enough to mostly abstain from hitting me and to maintain her ministrations to some extent, and I managed to wrap up the fight without too much hassle.My boss run stops here for the time being. Next in line should be Venus, unless another minor boss stands in my way. We'll see! Grimodar Castle was quite the wake-up call, although I took up the gauntlet and pretty much own the place now. The atmosphere is slowly getting grittier and heavier as dungeons become darker, more enclosed and considerably bigger, and I expect other nasty difficulty spikes along the way. I have a foreboding feeling that I will be forced to fight the misnamed Lord Shark at some point and a growing hunch that Fran is a dragon in disguise and probably the exiled daughter of some Dragon King living in a faraway land. To be continued! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Lord of Magna: Done and dusted", "date": "04/10/2015", "text": "After roughly 68 hours of play, I am finally done with Lord of Magna. I cleared nine playthroughs in a row, whose durations ranged from 16 hours for the first one to a little more than three hours for the last one, each playthrough being shorter than the one preceeding it. My whole crew boasts levels above 95, which will make any subsequent playthrough a complete walk in the park. If there is one, that is.Despite the fact that I spent an uncanny amount of time on that game and cleared an ridiculously high number of playthroughs, I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I had tons of fun with it, but this is in no part due to the game itself being good, because Lord of Magna is a shallow and unfinished game bristling with flaws. The truth is that despite recognizing the crapiness of that game, I desperately wanted to love it. I wanted to love it because I imported a physical copy, with shipping and toll fees involved, and I always try to recoup my investment in such situations; and I also wanted to love it because my last endeavours with the 3ds were disappointing, and my relationship with the handheld—and with Nintendo in general—is growing tense. I thus needed a positive 3ds gaming experience, lest my love for the system become precarious or even grow cold.Loving that game was no easy feat, mind you. I managed to wring some fun out of it only by trying my hardest to break the game, which was done by choosing the lowest difficulty setting and by grinding like crazy to make the whole crew overlevelled. For me, this was the only way to make battles enjoyable at all. These fight that were primarily designed to be long, drawn-out engagements, with minions respawning as you kill them and bosses taking 20 or more hits to die, suddenly became flowing displays of power and swiftness in which I could give in to the exhilaration of destroying foes en masse and slicing bosses dead with one neat hit. The enjoyment I derived from these battles was immense, and well worth every hour spent grinding for it. That being said, my hard-earned love for Lord of Magna didn't extend much farther than the red-hot, thrilling battles provided by my breaking of the game. Granted, I was also very fond of the graphics and the soundtrack, but the rest left me with feelings ranging from mild annoyance to open dislike:—The narrative is weak overall and the pacing is terrible. It takes far too long to get the first three girls in your party, yet the last four girls come way too fast and with little pause between them. There are way too many cutscenes and the characters speak incredibly slowly, even with the fastest text speed selected. It's so horrendous that had the fast-forwarding option not been available, I wouldn't have replayed the game even once.—There is literally no gameplay apart from the fighting. The crafting mechanics are a pitiful joke, because the game doesn't provide you with any sort of recipes and lets you figure out everything through trial-and-error. The \"romance\" is only another dose of fighting with cutscenes added, and the rest... Well, there is no rest. This game is nothing more than an endless stream of battles intercut with cutscenes, period. And although I deeply loved these battles, the absence of other gameplay elements was seriously stinging.—The fan-service is cringing. I have a massive issue with the fact that the game tries to present a squeaky clean image yet sneaks in some fan-service elements. Having to witness displays of maid uniform fetishism, sexual innuendos and that bath scene after beind fed all that talk about the girls being family and the inn being a shelter for them made me feel seriously unclean. What sort of family is that, seriously? I'd rather have a game that is upfront about its titillating content and goes for it full force than an hypocritical proposition such as Lord of Magna, because the latter makes me feel ten times more uncomfortable than the former.—The characters are quite unlikeable as a whole. The Artemisias are charming, granted—albeit a trifle cliché—but the rest of the cast is less than stellar. Luchs is painfully transparent, Amelia is your token annoying goody-two-shoes, and Bart... The less said about this perverted moron, the better. He is easily the worse character of the bunch, and I would have killed him with my own hands if I could. As for the rest of the cast, they are either too transparent to be memorable or totally unlikeable. And playing the game nine times in a row certainly didn't help alleviate my dislike for them.I have to admit that despite all my efforts to love it and squeeze some enjoyment out of it, Lord of Magna left a sour taste in my mouth. My ultimate celebratory playthrough with the whole overpowered cast was curiously anticlimatic and not nearly as fulfilling as I had hoped, which may deter me from replaying the game in the future. My relationship with the 3ds is still strained, and the next 3ds game I play had better be really excellent to mend the growing gap between me and the system. Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Demon Gaze: Oops, I'm in love again", "date": "30/09/2015", "text": "Aaah, dungeon crawlers sweet. Every time I get roughed up by a game too handholding and patronizing for my taste, I can run back to you and luxuriate in the gaming freedom I so crave. Praise all dungeon crawlers!That being said, I've not been running that often to first-person dungeon crawlers, since Demon Gaze is only the second of them I'm playing. The first was Class of Heroes on the PSP; and although I'm forever grateful to that game for having introduced me to that new favourite subgenre of mine and had a decent amount of fun with it, it cannot hold a candle to the awesomeness of Demon Gaze.So, where to start? Maybe with the specs of my run: I've been playing for roughly ten hours now, ten hours so engrossing that they feel like two hours at most. I've captured four demons so far, namely Comet, Mars, Chronos and Hermes, and I am well on my way to capture my fifth. And last but not least, I'm playing Solo. You didn't expect less from me, did you?I'm glad to be able to say that Demon Gaze is a game that totally lived up to my expectations, and even gloriously exceeded them. And that's saying something, because for some reason, I had sky-high expectations regarding that game before playing it, as well as very positive feelings towards it. The only thing I was really not fond of was the appearance of the main character, with his odd eye and \"look-how-edgy-and-tenebrous-I-am\" looks; although these attributes are justified by the storyline, they were a little too cliché for my taste. But the game pleasantly surprised me by allowing me to choose between no less than 45 character models for my main character, males as well as females. Because indeed, should your thirst for fan-service be unquenchable, you can choose a female avatar—even though your main character is supposed to be male and always referred to as such. Even more peculiar, you can switch avatars whenever you want during your playthrough, should you get bored of staring constantly at the same non-animated character model. Oh, well. We've seen weirder premises in Japanese games, I guess.Since I'm mentioning fan-service, it's worth noting that despite having been marketed as a fan-servicy proposition, Demon Gaze is quite tame when it comes to actual fan-servicy content. There is surprisingly little eye-candy to oggle at: sure, everybody is showing a fair amount of skin, males and females alike, but this skin display really doesn't feel exploitative, nor is it beyond the boundaries of what you would expect from your average fantasy setting. And despite what the promotion material seemed to imply, you don't spend your time fighting half-naked demon girls, but rather giant frogs, poisonous mushrooms and flying rats—in a nutshell, your average fantasy roster, with the usual colour palettes changes. Anyone who buys this game for its supposed fan-service is in for a sore disappointment, let me tell you that.Another pleasant surprise was the atmosphere. The official art had led me to expect a somewhat dark and gritty game, but this is actually the exact opposite: Demon Gaze gives off a warm, welcoming, nearly comfy vibe. The inn that serves as headquarters really feels like home, with its cosy rooms and lively staff, and the dungeons have a soothing quality that makes the roaming intensely pleasurable and the brutal difficulty of the game much more palatable.Demon Gaze surpassed my wildest expectations when it comes to accommodating a Solo Run. The implicit rule regarding such endeavours is that if a game allows you to proceed with the main character alone, then a Solo Run is indeed doable in said game; however, not all soloable games are equally indulgent once you start venturing forth as a lone ranger. Class of Heroes was not exactly making soloing easy, while Dragon Quest IX seemed to have been made for soloing—and Demon Gaze also belongs to that latter category. The game contains so many solo run-friendly features that I actually fail to understand why the option to assemble a party was put at all in the game, except as a nod or concession to old-school dungeon-crawling gameplay mechanics. There are pieces of equipment that allow the main character to learn precious skills belonging to other classes, such as slashing a whole row of foes at once, and the demons are more than fit to replace any party member when Boss Time comes. Granted, you can summon only one demon at a time, you cannot control their actions and they can be used only for a fixed number of turns, but they still get the job done beautifully, providing that you choose the right demon for the right battle. The money balance also becomes much more manageable when you only have one party member to attend to, and you can afford to pamper said only party member by decking him out in the best weapons and gear available. Isn't life sweet? A strange but most useful design choice is the one regarding Healing Staves: although they cannot be equipped by the main character, they can be kept in the inventory and used to heal yourself through the Item Menu. There seems to be no limit to the number of uses, and this is a delightfully expedient way to heal yourself free of charge. I have no idea if this is a glitch of sorts or a conscious design choice, but it sure is convenient for a solo runner.Last but not least, the dungeon-crawling itself is stellar. The game offers everything you could wish for and more when it comes to roaming: frequent save points in dungeons, gear that regenerates health while walking, steady drops from monsters, treasure maps with coordinates, useful abilities that help you find secret doors or protect you from hazard floors, auto-drawing maps, and even an amazing Auto-move function that lets you select any point on an already explored map and takes you there, saving you some time and button-pushing. It doesn't get any smoother and slicker than that, really. Cherry on the cake, the dungeons are quite gorgeous (in the Vita \"budget\" acception of the word, that is) and the soundtrack more than decent. By the time I finished writing this post, I captured fifth demon Neptune and I'm now joyously marching on towards the next demon in line. I should also be strong enough to defeat the Mimic in Star Curtain now, so I will give it a try and hope that I get a good drop for all my efforts. I'm getting more smitten with the game by the hour, and there will undoubtedly be more posts about it! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Playstation Store: A matter of temptation", "date": "27/09/2015", "text": "Although Nintendo is most pointed at and criticized when it comes to region-locking, they are not the only one indulging generously in it. The Playstation Store is also famously region-locked, each part of the world being allotted a different choice of games.There are ways around this issue for the dedicated who want games from all regions, granted. They involve creating several PSN accounts with addresses located in the desired regions and feeding them with PSN cards from said regions. As far as the Vita is concerned, this also involves owning one Vita for each account or rebooting your Vita entirely every time you want to purchase games from a different Playstation Store, since each PSN account has to be tied to a specific Vita unit. All in all, this involves a lot of hassle—and that's without even counting the usual chore of needing to have memory cards prepped up and your PSN account(s) conveniently filled up. All that to get mere digital games that can't even sit pretty on a shelf and be gazed at amorously. Up until now, the tediousness of that process alone was enough to deter me from even thinking of creating other PSN accounts. I created one a couple of months ago to get the three Atelier games, and did so only because they were not getting physical releases; this was already a huge step as far as I was concerned, since I'm usually reluctant to buy digital-only games, and other PSN accounts were definitely not on my radar. Things could have stopped at that, had I not made the fatal mistake of taking a peek at the North-American Playstation Store.Oh, the delicious torture!! There are dozens of PSP and Vita games there that have never been made available in the European Playstation Store: PSone classics, obscure RPGs, dungeon-crawlers and Japanese Simulation games, you name them. This sheer overabundance made my eyes pop and is haunting my dreams now, and I'm very close to caving in and creating another PSN account to grab all these marvels. On the other hand... I'm very much afraid that I would be biting off more than I could chew by making such a move. I already have dozens, if not hundreds of games to play, and the numbers are inflating by the year. Do I really need another batch of games added to the list at that point? Do I really need my already enormous backlog to be weightened further by games that may turn out to be disappointing? The question is open, and the answer is still pending. A part of me wants these games, and another part of me wants to stop gorging on new games and to concentrate on the ones I already own.I'd be curious to know if some of you fellow gamers have several PSN accounts and if you've been facing that same dilemma. And while I'm at it, and in case the greedy collector in me wins, which RPGs from the North-American Playstation Store would you wholeheartdly recommend? Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Xenoblade Chronicles 3D: Hate at first sight", "date": "23/09/2015", "text": "I'm royally pissed off right now. And also crestfallen. So that is the quality of the New 3ds exclusives? This is what I bought the system for? Naaah, okay: I'm exaggerating for the sake of drama. I bought a New 3ds as a backup system, not solely to play Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, and I certainly don't regret having bought that New 3ds. Xenoblade Chronicles, on the other hand... Jeez, I curse the instant I opened my wallet to purchase that game. I've had instant love affairs with so many great games in the last years that I somehow forgot that the opposite could also happen. Yet Xenoblade Chronicles shoved that unpleasant reality in my face, and I hate it all the more for that. Not that there was a lot of room to squeeze more hate, mind you: I don't remember having ever loathed a game that much upon the first minutes of playing it. Right now, thinking of XC makes me feel nauseous. I kid you not.Of course, I won't stop at saying that I hate that game's guts. I will elaborate and get the whole thing out of my chest, lest these bilious feelings fester inside my soul. Be off with them! Here's an exhaustive litany of all the things that aggravated, antagonized and infuriated me during my hour spent playing XC. (Yes, my hour. I couldn't stand more of it.) —The sheer ugliness of the game offends my retinas. The fact that the graphics are blurry and look like a giant pixelated mash is already insulting enough, but that rampant ugliness is worsened by the total absence of any discernable aesthetics. XC is just your dreary, tedious, run-of-the-mill attempt at photorealism, with washed-out colours and blonky character models devoid of any charm. I like my games to showcase a modicum of graphic stylization, and XC sadly shows nothing else than a total lack of inspiration in that department.—The little I've seen of XC is already way too messy and complicated for my taste and comfort. There are way too many actions to execute and data to keep track of in battles, way too many items, way too much of everything. I fought only a couple of battles and yet XC threw at me a mountain of items and just as many tutorials. Have you ever heard of that thing called learning curve, game? And let's not even talk about those useless hindrances such as needing to readjust the camera or to lock on an enemy before being able to fight them. Why can't I just stomp over them like in good ol' Dragon Quest IX, damnit? The worse part is that this overwhelming complexity seems to have been shoved into the game just for the sake of it. But just like throwing tons of yummy ingredients into a pot is not enough to make a delicious soup, throwing tons of gameplay elements into a game is not enough to make said game compelling. Far from ravishing or impressing me, this sprawling, milling mass of gameplay mechanics left me overwhelmed and nauseated.—Likewise, the sheer scale of the game world is just too enormous for my taste. Since I've been playing on portable systems for most of my gaming life, I'm used to game worlds that are much more compact and somewhat easier to embrace and assess, and the scales at work in XC seriously disorient me. I'm also not too fond of having to cover such humongous distances just to go anywhere. It took me literally five minutes of running through grassy areas to rally the first town in the game, and that's five minutes I could have employed to do something much more interesting. As much as I enjoy taking a five-minute walk to the grocery store in real life, I really don't want to see this kind of experience emulated in a video game. And just like the overabundance of gameplay mechanics, the enormity of the game world seems to have been implemented just because, probably with the secret intention of flabbergasting players and reviewers alike. Wooo, look at our huge game world!! You've never seen something that big, have you? Well, bigger is not always better, especially when your big game world looks fugly. I'm definitely not impressed, game.—The little I've seen of the story left me rolling my eyes and facepalming myself. Yeah, I know that the story of XC is widely said to be stellar; but honestly, I have a very hard time believing that a story starting with two guys bantering before single-handedly taking down an army of mechas with a super-powerful mythical sword will be anything else than a milling mass of J-RPG clichés and platitudes, no matter how many references to Nietzsche and Jung are thrown into the mix. Also, I hate stories that pit humans against mechas. And given that hardly anything happened in one hour except for a couple of vapid dialogues, I can also tell that the pacing of XC is much too sluggish for my taste. The mere idea of spending seventy or more hours playing that snooze fest makes me shudder with horror.—Last but certainly not least, the battle system is a pathetic joke. I'm still seething when thinking of it, seriously. I started frothing at the mouth and spitting in disbelief when I realized that the cursed game was handholding and patronizing to the point of triggering hits without my input when I got close to enemies. Colour me outraged and appalled. How fun can it be to butcher foes if said butchering is not the direct result of my generous button-mashing? This is like the worst of two worlds put together in one fighting system, as you have to suffer both the hectic and somewhat taxing pace of real-time fighting and the lack of direct input of turn-based fighting. There are also way too many moves to choose from on the fly for my taste; I like my real-time fighting to be a simple and streamlined affair, not some kind of multi-tasking test. The constant babbling and interjecting of the characters during fighting made focusing even harder, and I wished I could just shut them off. I've read that this fighting system makes room for an amazing amount of strategizing, and maybe it does later on; but in these early stages, I just found it messy, scattered and totally unfulfilling.I've painted a very bleak picture so far, and you may wonder if there was really nothing in that game that appealed to me. Well, there was actually something: I was very fond of the British voice acting. However, I'm not going to suffer that game solely for the pleasure of hearing British accents. I was half-thinking of watching a playthrough, but I'm not sure I want to waste 70 hours or more of my life doing that, especially since I could clear one or two better games instead. So I'll probably leave it at that and try to forget that bitter gaming failure. I've already started, in fact: I've been playing a brand-new game for a couple of hours, and said game is so excellent that XC is as good as lost in the sands of time. More on that soon! As for my pitiful experience with XC, it taught me at least one important thing: don't believe the hype! Just because 97% of players and reviewers praise a game doesn't automatically mean that I will like it. (Heck, the opposite has happened often enough!) And also: be wary of home console ports, especially the ones bragging about their huge open world. Bigger is not always better, indeed, and I'd rather stick with the small-scale cosiness of portable gaming worlds. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Coveted games: Vintage sweet", "date": "13/09/2015", "text": "We're heading toward a most glorious autumn gaming-wise, with an impressive number of games slated for release all the way to Christmas. I'm vibrating with anticipation and impatience, while my bank account is bracing itself for the massive blow to come. Without further ado, here's my list of much-wanted games for the next four months! Enjoy, and don't hesitate to share your own coveted games in the comments!Code: Realize-Guardian of Rebirth(Vita): So this is a visual novel, and an otome game to boot. Am I interested in otome games? Not that much, but I can always enjoy a good story doubled with a great art style. Code: Realize has the latter in spades; whether it also boasts the former remains to be seen and will determine whether I purchase this game or not. Corpse Party: Blood Drive(Vita): I'm usually not too fond of survival horror and the like, but this is published by Marvelous, and well... I like Marvelous. They never disappointed me so far, and I want to keep supporting them as much as I can. And who knows, maybe I will lap it up and discover myself a new favourite gaming genre. Norn9: Var Commons(Vita): Another otome game with a great art style that will have to boast a rock-solid story to gain admittance in my precious collection. I already know that the game contains a record number of endings, namely 24, which means a lot of replay value; and replay value is good, yes precious.Sword Art Online: Lost Song(Vita): The first game in the series was never released in the West, the second was released digitally, and this third entry will benefit from a full-blown physical release. Now that's what I call progress! Anyway, this is an Action-RPG, which is enough to grant it a place of choice in my collection without even the shadow of a second thought. Next!Dungeon Travelers 2: The Royal Library and the Monster Seal(Vita): Finding data about this one is a trifle hard: apart from the fact that it is a dungeon crawler, a spin-off to an obscure series and that it seems to sport an enormous amount of fan-service, there is really not much to work with. Oh yes, and it's a Sting offering! I love Sting so far, so that makes it an absolute must-by. The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steal(Vita): Gee, what a great name! It sounds so evocative, so heroic—the kind of name that promises an epic adventure of massive proportions. Whether it will be the case or not remains to be seen, and reservations can be emitted. Although I loved the little I've played from Nihon Falcom, I've read enough negative opinions about the \"Legend of Heroes\" subseries to make me think that said subseries is very much an acquired taste. I will thus approach it carefully and brace myself for the worse—while hoping for the best.The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes(3ds): This one looks suspiciously like a rip-off of the FF Crystal Chronicles games, with its emphasis on complementary abilities and teamwork to solve puzzles and progress through dungeons. That's fine with me, because I rather like this concept. I just fervently hope that the AI of your allies is not as abysmal as in Ring of Fates and that these cute little Link-alikes won't die on me by running head first into holes, standing under enemy fire or who knows what other display of stupidity.  Return to Popolocrois: Story of Seasons Fairytale(3ds): A crossover between Popolocrois and Story of Seasons, formerly known as Harvest Moon? Sure, why not? Weirder unions have happened in the world of videogaming. I really loved Popolocrois and I'd be glad to revisit that world again, even though I'm a little bit bummed that the developers didn't emulate the exquisite art style of the PSP version of Popolocrois and stuck to run-of-the-mill 3D instead. Oh, well.Moco Moco Friends(3ds): I first read about this game on YvoCaro's blog, and I was glad I did, because it would have most certainly passed me by otherwise. I would probably have dismissed it as child's fare, and missed a colourful dungeon crawler with a Pokemon-lite flavour in the process. And since the game is aimed at children, it will probably sport a mellow and forgiving gameplay, which is just fine by me. I love playing easy-going dungeon crawlers once in a while.That's nine games, folks! More than I can play in a single autumn, but that doesn't matter. I'm so glad to see that the release pace is getting brisker than ever, both for the Vita and the 3ds—even though, let's face it, this is a surefire sign that both systems are heading towards the end of their tenure. I wouldn't be surprised if early 2017 saw the pair bow out after a final glorious year of releases—because indeed, 2016 promises to be just as packed with exciting games as 2015. Time will tell, and in the meantime, There Will Be Games! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Lord of Magna: Smooth sailing", "date": "09/09/2015", "text": "Six done, two to go! This whole grinding affair is working much, much better than even I dared to expect. I only have to bring Francesca and Adelheid up to the lofty 90s, and then I'll have a whole crew of overpowered characters ready to use for any subsequent playthrough of Lord of Magna. Life is sweet!I'll explain in my final post about Lord of Magna why having overpowered characters is so important to me in that particular game. For now, I'd like to focus on the romance mechanics present in the game and on the function of said romance mechanics, which is more crucial than it seems to be at first sight. But first, let me get one thing out of the way: the term \"romance\" is absolutely misplaced here, for there is not the slightest shred of actual romancing in Lord of Magna. Although Luch's conversations with the girls often have a mild flirtatious edge, there are no genuine romantic developments to speak of and no specific romantic endings for each girl. What we get instead are innuendos, declarations of love that are taken back right away under the pretense of being joking (yes, that does happen) and a general coyness that is certainly quite endearing yet will very likely leave romance aficionados deeply unsated.That's not to say that the misnamed romance in Lord of Magna has no purpose whatsoever, because it does. The most obvious purpose of the so-called \"Heart Events\" is to unlock specific fighting abilities that will be most welcome during battles; and then, there is a deeper, more secret purpose that can only be unearthed if you clear the game several times in a row. I learnt about this arcane purpose the hard way, and I want to spare other fellow gamers the pain of seeing a whole playthrough go down the drain due to a lack of understanding of the game's most secret gameplay mechanics. (Yes, that did happen.)We're talking level preservation between playthroughs here, and the basic rule in the matter goes as such: the game lets you carry over the levels of two characters to your first New Game +, then lets you add one more character to the fold with each subsequent playthrough you clear. While the gist of this proposition is true, there is actually a hidden condition for it to take effect. That hidden condition is that the girl that is chosen to become a Goddess at the end of Chapter 12 must be one that has not been chosen before. If you end up with a girl that has already been elected in a former playthrough like I did once, the game won't let you add another character to the lucky crew that can hang on to their levels and your whole playthrough will have been for naught.Now, here's the golden rule regarding that pivotal event: the girl that is chosen as a you-know-what in a given playthrough is the girl with whom you've played the most Heart Events in that particular playthrough. Each girl partakes in three Heart Events over the course of a playthrough, so secure at least two Heart Events with the girl of your choice and you should be in the clear. In the case of a tie, the game requires you to choose between the two involved girls at the end of Chapter 12. A tie is actually unavoidable in the case of Diana, Francesca and Adelheid, who come so late in the game that their third Heart Event takes place in Chapter 13.Now that the arcane rules of level conservation are laid bare, I will go back to my grinding and give the final push to raise my whole crew to lofty levels. I'm nearly there! Each playthrough is smoother and faster than the one before thanks to the increasing number of overpowered characters, and I'm enjoying this more than I would ever have anticipated. I'll come back to wrap this up with a final post, and very soon at that! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Collector's delight: A most purrfect edition", "date": "06/09/2015", "text": "Although my collecting endeavours regarding the Nintendo DS are mostly over now, I still occasionally purchase a DS-related item: the odd RPG I've never heard of because it was so confidential, or a comfy pouch to host one of my many systems. Or, in this case, a brand-new system stamped with a series' name. Behold the gorgeous \"Echoes of Time\" Nintendo DSi!It is a Japanese exclusive, and I became aware of its existence as I was idly browsing the Nintendo DS section of Ebay to check the current prices of DSis. I was instantly struck by the beauty of that piece of kit and searched for it on Ebay, but that search produced only a couple of unsatisfying results. I then turned to good ol' Amazon, and to my utter surprise, a search there yielded dozens of results. I had half-feared that this special edition would be hard to find nowadays, but that doesn't seem to be the case—all the better for me, as I promptly secured myself a fairly priced copy. That purchase was not motivated by an undying love for the Final Fantasy franchise or the Crystal Chronicles sub-series, since I know both of them very little, but rather by the sheer looks of the system. I love white consoles as a rule, and the fact that this one sported a picture of a stylized cat only added to my infatuation.I was not disappointed when discovering the system in all its physical glory. It has a pleasant matte finish and is ever-so-slightly grainy to the touch, like most brand-new DSi. This little beast just looks gorgeous overall, and although it was mostly intended as yet another backup system, I may actually indulge in using it every once in a while.While this was the first Japanese DSi I ever purchased, it may not be the last. I've had my eye on the SaGa 2 special edition for a very long time, and the Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days edition looks gorgeous too; and I'm pretty sure that there are other beautiful special editions out there that I've not even heard of. Yet. I'm going to hunt for them, and purchase them if they please my retinas. A collector's work is never done, indeed! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Danganronpa: The end of the road—yet not quite (SPOILERS!)", "date": "01/09/2015", "text": "After 18 intense hours, I finally finished Danganronpa. And boy, am I delighted! From the early hours shrouded in mystery to the final revelatory plot twist, it has been an amazing ride, and I loved every single minute of it. Even the Bullet Time Battles became entertaining after a while—somehow. Anyway, this was a great gaming experience that enthralled me all the way through and didn't disappoint me in the slightest, which is rare enough to be mentioned. It could have disappointed me, mind you: no matter how you look at it, there are still heaps of unanswered questions at the end of the game. Lingering unaddressed plot points at the end of a narrative usually have a way of irritating me to no end, yet they didn't do so in Danganronpa. They didn't do so because I got a satisfying and conclusive answer regarding the most burning question of them all, namely the identity of the Mastermind. Shedding light on that most challenging enigma left me deeply sated—so much so that knowing the actual state of the outside world didn't really matter that much to me after that. I am perfectly content with this Cube-like ending that lets us see nothing more than a dazzling flash of white light when our crew finally manages to open the school doors, and I'll wait patiently to play Danganronpa 2 and Ultra Despair Girls to get more information about the state of the world. Or not, because I really wouldn't be surprised if said state of the world were bound to remain an enigma throughout the whole series, just like the real identity of the Cigarette-Smoking Man in The X-Files. And surprisingly enough for someone who likes narratives to tie up loose ends in a neat and nice way, such an outcome wouldn't bother me either.And why would it bother me, when I've been served such a grand plot twist—coupled with such a magistral Mastermind character? To my giddy delight, I really didn't see it coming. Or rather, I saw it coming somehow while still not having a clue. I suspected before the last Class Trial that Junko's body had been used as a decoy, because the wounds found on Mukuro's supposed body were similar to the ones that killed Junko; however, it never dawned on me that Mukuro could have passed as Junko and that Junko could be alive and well, and pulling the strings to boot. Oh, the plot twist! That was brilliant. Junko sure didn't disappoint as your crazy Mastermind, with her twisted outlook on life and her constant switching between what could only been described as the most overused and cliché anime voice-acting styles—from the dumb kawaii girl to the gloomy mysterious one—with the corresponding expressions to match. That came accross as a delicious parody of anime tropes, and I lapped it up with vengeful delight, especially so soon after having suffered Steins;Gate's gallery of cliché characters. I'm quite glad that Kyoko didn't turn out to be the Mastermind after all; I had taken a fancy to her as the game progressed, and it would have been painful to see her reveal a vicious side. Of course, she's not completely in the clear either: this whole story with her father remains mostly unexplained, and Monokuma's sudden return to life at the very end of the story to the vibrant scream of \"I am the Headmaster!\" could indicate that said father is still alive and playing his part in this whole mess. Or not. Well, time and the sequel will tell us if it's the case. Or not. Who can tell with that twisted mind-bender of a game? Story aside, I loved absolutely everything in Danganronpa: the colourful cast of characters with their obvious parodic charge, the amazing pacing, the cardboard cutout aesthetics, the slickly fluorescent lights in the corridors, Monokuma's theatrical musings, the limited yet brilliant voice acting, the endearing low-fi, budget quality, Hina's unholy love for donuts that made me crave some myself, and so on. I fervently hope that the sequel and the \"Ultra Despair Girls\" episode will be just as stellar as this first instalment, and I'm already licking my chops at the thought of playing them. The second episode is already mine to play and UDG will be released in just a couple of days, so the time may be ripe for a delicious Danganronpa marathon. But as always, my gaming instinct will have the last word! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Senran Kagura 2: A very physical edition indeed", "date": "28/08/2015", "text": "I received today my European physical copy of Senran Kagura 2: Deep Crimson, ordered months ago on the Marvelous website. Joy and delight!I loved the first game so much that missing on the second one was simply not an option. I was first planning to purchase the North-American version, until I learnt that Marvelous Europe would be printing physical copies on demand. I immediately felt compelled to support this great policy by ordering my own copy, and so did I. I have to admit that Marvelous Europe did an amazing job at offering an wide range of special editions of the game. I'm the kind of gamer who sees goodies and feelies primarily as useless dust-collectors, unless they are somehow connected to the game's content—which they were not in these particular cases—so I went for the game alone. Yet with hindsight, and as much as I commend Marvelous Europe's pre-ordering campaign, I nearly wish that I had ordered the North-American version instead. For, lo and behold:That cover!! Come on, Marvelous, what were you thinking? Do you realize that because of your tacky design choices, I cannot let this game's box lie around in my flat? On the other hand, it's pretty consistent with the cover art of the first instalment, and I certainly appreciate this consistency. Still... Even the Japanese cover art of both SKB and SK2 is ten times more sober than that, and I cannot help but question the choice of that particular cover art for Europe. Weren't Marvelous Europe afraid that such a raunchy cover would hurt sales? Didn't they realize that for every gamer licking their chops at the prospect of playing games with such risqué covers and going for it shamelessly and petulantly, there would be another gamer that would shudder at the though of being seen in a game shop with these things in their hands and/or at the thought of having them lying around in their bedroom/flat? Oh, well. I personally don't really mind that much, especially knowing the campy and self-derisive undertone of the game. I'll just keep it safely tucked away, lest eyes more innocent than mine fall upon it. Anyway, I was not planning to play a Beat'em Up right now, but I may well change my mind after having received that precious. Or not. My gaming instinct rules the game, and it has not decided yet what to do regarding SK2. One thing is sure, though: I'm delighted with Marvelous Europe, and I hope they repeat the experience and bring more physical editions of their games to the Old Continent. And if other publishers could follow suit, that would be even better. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Danganronpa-Trigger Happy Havoc: Compare this to a Ferris wheel", "date": "23/08/2015", "text": "Six chapters in, and I still don't have a clue about what's really happening in that game. That's just brilliant.Well, saying that I don't have a clue is not totally fair. I actually do have tons of clues about what could, may or might be happening in this sky-forsaken school; however, I still lack absolute, rock-solid certainties. Is this all a sick real-TV game? A post-apocalyptic rescue attempt that turned terribly wrong? The crazy product of a psychopathic mind—doubled with a seemingly infinite bank account balance? All of that at once? Or something else entirely, something even more twisted and devious? I do NOT know, and I LOVE not knowing. I love stories that let you imagine anything while confirming nothing, and Danganronpa is one of the most glorious example of them I've ever encountered.My mind is reeling just now, but I'm trying to keep it in check. I wouldn't want too think too deep and to uncover the actual truth about what's happening, ruining any plot twist to come in the process. Better concentrate on the gameplay and let the story properly blow me away, yes precious. I'm thus trying to bury my doubts about (spoilers) whether the masked body really belonged to Ikubasa Mukuro and may not have been the body of one of the already dead female students, conveniently kept in a cooler before being used in an elaborate setup. I mean, the face was unrecognizable, so it could have been anyone, right? And a tattoo is just so easy to fake. I'm trying to forget the uneasiness I feel regarding Kyoko, who seems just a little to helpful and knowledgeable to be completely honest. How can I be sure that she's not Ikubasa Mukuro herself, or the Mastermind—or both? After all, I didn't get to see what's really hiding under her precious gloves, did I? And how do I know that there are really sixteen students in the school, anyway? And... Oh dear, now I'm starting again. Like I said, better concentrate on the gameplay. To my utter delight, there is a substantial amount of it—enough to make Danganronpa more akin to a Point and Click on rails than to a full-blown Visual Novel. There's a delicious amount of roaming around and clicking on suspicious and/or interesting areas, and it wasn't look before I felt like the whole school was my territory—as much as a prison can be considered territory, that is. The Class Trials are a vibrant potpourri of gameplay mechanics that are challenging enough to keep me on edge, especially since I set the logic level to \"Mean\" when I started the game. In retrospect, I should have set the action level to \"Gentle\", because the shooting parts often give me a hard time. I even royally failed the first Bullet Time Battle: to my utter shame, I totally panicked and ended up tripping on my own fingers and losing before I could say \"ohshitshitshit that's a bloody rhythm minigame!!!\" I fortunately got better at it with time, but Bullet Time Battles are still far from being my favourite parts of the game. Oh, well.I really love the characters, and I deeply regret that so many are dead already. They are glorious clichés that zealously adhere to anime and manga tropes, that much is sure, but they do so in a clever and tongue-in-cheek way that makes them incredibly endearing. They cannot be deemed realistic or even complex characters, but that fits the style of the narrative perfectly. The unrealistic, slightly surreal premise of being stuck in a school and encouraged to kill your classmates by a creepy mastermind certainly wouldn't work as well with realistic characters—especially when the mastermind in question assumes the shape of a Teddy Bear with a lopsided grin.Anyway, I'm now heading towards what I hope will be a mind-blowing ending. There's only one Class Trial left, and it will be the most intense of them all. Brace yourself, Monokuma! Whoever you may be, I'll shed light on your true identity! Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Lord of Magna: From good to gone to amazing", "date": "21/08/2015", "text": "Oh, how fast can a gamer's feelings towards a game change. Right now, I am soaked in Lord of Magna and feeling like I could play it forever; however, things were drastically different just a few gameplay hours ago. So drastically different, in fact, that I had virtually given up on the game somewhere around the end of July, after ten hours of what I would describe as excruciatingly tedious gameplay. I couldn't stand anymore the vapid dialogues, tepid battles and general lack of bite of the game, which felt painfully like the unfinished business it is. Although I deeply loved the aesthetics and the gentle atmosphere of Lord of Magna, it was just too boring, empty and unfulfilling, and I dropped it with a deep, mournful sigh of regret for all the money I had spent importing my physical copy, seemingly for naught.So what happened in the meantime? Well, after a couple of weeks away from the game, I found myself yearning to play it again. This was my gaming instinct at work, and I usually never resist it, so I caved in and dove back into Lord of Magna. I had given up just before the rescue of Adelheid, i.e. virtually at End Game's doors, so mustering the energy to give one final push and clear the whole thing didn't seem too hard. However, something totally unexpected happened: I started enjoying the game in earnest. This major change can be attributed solely to one thing: the discovery of Free Battles, which I hadn't deigned to touch until then. These battles allowed me to indulge into an activity that I was sorely missing without even realizing it: Grinding. And boy, what a pleasant grinding it was! Not only did I reap tons of money and levels, powering up my crew in the process, but it also gave me a much better understanding of the fighting system. Up until then, battles had been too few and far between to get the gist of said battle system in earnest; but this lack came to an end as I fought one Free Battle after the other, exhilarated by the quick progression of my characters and the smoothness of the whole process. Before I knew it, I had beaten Kaiser to a pulp—the poor guy didn't really stand a chance against my Lv. 94 crew—and was headed to New Game Plus. That was when I became hooked for good, as I discovered that the levels of two characters could be carried over to the new run as well as a couple of items. Add to this the unrestricted use of the fast-forwarding option during the story segments and you get a deliciously flowing and intoxicating gameplay experience, with battles faster and smoother than ever. I'm totally in love with Lord of Magna right now, and I want it to never, ever end.It will end, of course, but not before I get my fill of it. My current goal is to raise the levels of the whole crew to their maximum, as well as to unlock all the romantic events (read \"battles\", for this is how it goes in this game) for all the ladies and to own all the available Skill Chips. I let Charlotte and Luchs keep their levels to give me a good edge during that second run, and it's working like a charm: I already reached Chapter Four, and it shouldn't be too long before I reach the end. Of course, I'm fighting Free Battles like there's no tomorrow, because it is such a giddy pleasure to see Charlotte and Luchs go on a rampage while Beatrix and Elfriede gain levels at the speed of light. I can't get enough of it, really—which is good, because I still have a couple of runs to clear before reaching my aforementioned ultimate goal. Until then, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Still alive and kicking!", "date": "21/08/2015", "text": "No, That Extra Level ain't dead yet! I don't want my blogging ventures to end just now. I feel like I've barely scrapped the surface of that whole blogging thing: there is still so much to discover and so many games to write about! I didn't even reach my 100th post, damnit! And frankly, I miss writing about games. It had become part of my routine before I even realized it, and life without my daily dose of gaming-related writing feels a bit... hollow.That being said, my schedule issues didn't magically disappear in two days. They are still alive and well, but I've found a way to circumvent them: to reduce the size of my posts. I cannot afford anymore to write these exquisitely, achingly, impossibly long posts in which I tried to cover every single aspect of a game, often including data and trivia that could be found somewhere else on the internet. This was not my goal at first: although I love reading data and trivia about games, my intention was never to relay such information on my blog. My intention was to offer my own insight into the games I play, and I've deviated from that goal somehow. It's now time to steer back onto the right track, and I'll do so by shearing my posts of any unecessary fat. No more data that everyone can check on Wikipedia, no more trivia that can be found compiled on websites dedicated solely to that purpose, no more pictures by the truckload while professional gaming sites offer tons of much higher-quality pictures. What will remain are my own impressions and thoughts about games, all exposed in a gloriously detailed way. It wouldn't be That Extra Level if I didn't zealously dissect everything in sight, now would it?:DTo accommodate my schedule better, I will also give up on a rule that I followed since the very beginning, namely to wait until I completely clear a game before I start writing about it. Not only did this rule force me to compile an impossibly huge amount of information at once, but it is also at odds with my way of playing games. See, I like to scour games thoroughly and to wring every last shred of enjoyment out of them before moving on to the next game in line, fully sated and happy. This often involves playing several runs in a row and/or grinding intensively, and it is obviously not compatible with waiting to have cleared a game to write about it. I could pull it off until now because I somehow forced myself to rush through games in order to be able to play more of them, but I want to go back to my natural ways now. I want every game to be a gastronomic feast that I take all the time in the world to savour, not a fast-food meal that I gobble down without really enjoying the taste of it. This means that I will write about games as I discover them and play them; and if anything, it may lead to an even greater avalanche of details. Brace yourself!So, I'll soldier on and overcome the obstacle by making the necessary changes. As Celeste in Danganronpa says, \"You have to adapt or perish\", or something along those lines. I'm not ready to put this blog to death yet, and I'll do my best to make it thrive and flourish. See you soon for more posts! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Closed until further notice", "date": "18/08/2015", "text": "I won't beat around the bush, dear fellow gamers: from now on, this blog is on indefinite hiatus.The reason for this is quite simple: schedule issues. Ever since I started that blog, I've been using some of my alloted gaming time to write my posts. Writing about games thus meant that I could play less games, and I used to laugh at the sweet irony of that situation; however, now that I have slightly less gaming time on my hands than two years ago and more games to play than ever, I'm not laughing any longer. Blogging is preying upon my gaming time in more ways than one, and the situation has slowly but surely become unsustainable. Something's got to give, and since it's certainly not going to be gaming, it has to be blogging about games.Though only time will tell if I will start posting again in two months, one year or never, that doesn't mean that I abandon the blogging sphere entirely. I will keep reading and commenting my favourite gaming blogs as well as checking That Extra Level every now and then; and if I find a clever way to work things out schedule-wise, I will be back with more posts. So, it's a good-bye for now, but hopefully not an adieu. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Steins;Gate (2): From good to gone (SPOILERS!)", "date": "15/08/2015", "text": "Afterroughly thirty hours of intense reading and button-mashing, I am finally donewith Steins;Gate. I am somehowrelieved that the whole thing is over at long last, but that is not my dominantfeeling about that game. No; my dominant feeling is disappointment.That’sright, disappointment. Steins;Gatebasically failed to live up to my expectations and transformed over time intosomething that I didn’t quite enjoy. Of course, you could blame me for having expectationsin the first place, but here’s the thing: the game itself planted these expectations in me. The truth is that I had nopreconceived idea about Steins;Gatebefore I started playing it; however, after being fed the delicious data-ladenfour exposition chapters, my expectations regarding the narrative went off theroof. I pictured a convoluted storyline with branching paths completing eachother à la 999, rife with plot twistsand dramatic time paradoxes, all peppered with mind-bending concepts and drippingwith irony and dark humour.Worse by the endingWhat Igot instead was a cliché light novel with a strong romantic flavour and a touchof harem. When I complained about the mundanity of Suzuha and Okabe’s bloominglove story in the “Irreversible Reboot” ending, little did I know that this wasactually the template for five of thegame’s six endings. I was absolutely livid when I realized that, and afterhaving cleared these five romantic endings in a row, I was literally frothingat the mouth. Had I written a post at that moment, it would have been the mostscathing harangue of them all; fortunately, the uncovering of the so-called“True Ending” somehow saved the day and soothed my foul mood. That’s not to saythat said “True Ending” is a deeply satisfying outcome that managed to redeemthe whole game in my eyes, but it certainly fared much better than its fivecounterparts. At least, it didn’t turn out to be a harem ending of sorts; Ithink a piece of my soul would have died if it had been the case. Anyway, let’stake a closer look at these ill-fitted romantic endings:—6/Isolated Jamais Vu: This endingoccurs at the end of the 7th chapter if you choose not to send theD-Mail, regardless of how many True Ending flags you triggered before. It pairsOkabe with Faris and is by far the most unpolished ending of the bunch, leavinggaping plot holes in its trail. For one thing, it actually takes place on a yetanother Attractor Field, although the game never tells you that clearly.According to the Steins;Gate wiki,this is supposed to be Attractor Field Omega, an attractor field in which theSERN threat may still be lurking around if the presence of the divergence meteris to be believed. The changes occurring in this worldline are quite drastic,since Okabe finds himself being your average student instead of the chuunibyou patient he used to be and notknowing Daru and Mayuri at all. That is all nice and well, and I certainlyappreciate the harshness of this outcome, but there is a problem: we are nottold how this result was obtained. Weonly know that Faris sent a certain D-mail that was supposed to save herfather, but the actual content of that mail is not shown to us; instead, weonly get to witness the radical consequences of its sending. Do you seriouslyexpect me to swallow this and be happy with it, game? Sorry, but that won’thappen. I won’t let you get away with such complacency, and I deem that endingthe crappiest of the bunch. Next!—5/IrreversibleReboot: This ending occurs at the end of the 6th chapter if youchoose not to send the D-Mail, regardless of how many True Ending flags youtriggered before. I criticized it in my last post, but in hindsight, it isactually my second favourite ending after the True Ending. It is poignant andlaced with angst, and it gives a greater understanding of Suzuha’s character.Of course, it is not satisfactory either, since we’re left with no idea ifOkabe and Suzuha’s risky trip to 1975 bears fruit (and to my dismay, the othersendings don’t allude to this point at all).—4/Lindof Corruption and Rebirth: This ending occurs at the end of the 8thchapter if you choose not to send the D-Mail, regardless of how many TrueEnding flags you triggered before. It takes place on Attractor Field Alpha andpairs Okabe with female Lukako. Honestly, this ending is a complete joke. Wehave to face the horrible truth here: Lukako’s absurd sex change wasimplemented in the game for the sole purpose of allowing Okabe to have aromance with Lukako without treading into Boy’s Love territory. Sure, thewriters tried to integrate that element into the narrative by making it affectthe worldlines, but the result is utterly laughable: it turns out that femaleLukako broke the IBN 5100 because she was sweeping the storehouse where it waskept, while male Lukako only swept the courtyard and thus left the computerintact. So, same body, voice and clothing from male to female, but differentsweeping patterns? Allow me to grin sarcastically at that point. —3/StardustSky: This ending occurs at the 10th chapter if you triggered none ofthe True Ending flags beforehand. It takes place on the recovered Beta AttractorField and pairs Okabe with good ol’ Mayuri, but also implies the death ofKurisu. This is an unremarkable ending for the most part and seems to have beenput in the game solely to inflate the number of available outcomes. —2/ParadoxMeltdown: A tad harder to obtain, this ending occurs at the 10thchapter if you triggered up to five True Ending flags. Taking place on both theAlpha and Beta Attractor Fields, it is a very emotional ending that shows Okabeadmitting his crush on Kurisu and mourning the fact that he has to sacrificeher to save both Mayuri and the future. It is also mostly superfluous, since itturns out to be a truncated version of the True Ending. Althoughendings 4 to 6 offer interesting developments as well as revelatory insightsinto some of the characters’ psyche, they have the major flaw of shifting thefocus from the eradication of the SERN menace to the pursuit of Okabe’snewfound romantic interests. Well, excuse me, but I don’t care one bit aboutOkabe’s carnal urges and fickle love stories. What I care about is to knowwhether the SERN threat has been circumvented for good, which is not answeredin a conclusive way in any of these three endings. Worldlines have been manipulatedso thoroughly that it could be thecase, but we don’t know for sure,which is deeply frustrating. As for endings 2 and 3, they do solve the SERNissue by shifting back to the original Beta Attractor Field, but they are farfrom being satisfying either. If you look at it closely, they are actually thesame exact ending in terms of actual events, the only difference between thembeing Okabe’s romantic focus: “Stardust Sky” shows him content with hisdecision to save Mayuri and brushing off Kurisu’s death, while “ParadoxMeltdown” extensively shows his despair at losing his beloved Kurisu. At anyrate, they both turn out to be a trifle boring and they fail to elicit the deeprelief that a return to Attractor Field Beta should be expected to provide. True Ending, where art thou?To feelthat much-awaited relief, you have to wait for the unfolding of the fabled andhighly elusive “True Ending”. Titled “Open the Steins Gate”, it is by far themost complete and satisfying of the bunch: it ties together loose elements thatappeared at the very beginning of the story and wraps things up in a clever anddelightful way. Too bad this masterful narrative was not the template for allof Steins;Gate’s endings, really.That delicious dish of a True Ending is only ever-so-slightly spoiled by thecliché concept that supports it, namely the existence of a worldlineindependent from any attractor field where the future could be shaped accordingto one’s own free will. Hum, haven’t I seen this before in, like, a millionJ-RPGs? Oh, well. Ifinally used an FAQ to navigate my way to this ending—and boy, don’t I regretit. The requirements for the unlocking of “Open the Steins Gate” areridiculously arcane, and I’m pretty sure that I would have given up on the gamelong before triggering them. Here’s the deal: you must build a relationshipwith Kurisu that will prove intense and enduring enough to motivate futureOkabe on worldline Beta to dive again into time-travel research and find a wayto set things rights after Kurisu’s death. This is done by exchanging a seriesof emails with Kurisu over the course of the game’s ten chapters, and the trueending flags are triggered by answering specific words in her emails—or, in onecase, by not answering them. Asidefrom the fact that exchanging a couple of emails seems a trifle too superficiala way to strengthen a love bond, even in these digital times, these flagspresent a stinging problem: although they make perfect sense in the context ofthe True Ending, it is virtually impossible to guess what they are beforeuncovering said True Ending. You could spend dozens of hours trying to figureout which emails are relevant between Mayuri’s, Faris’, Lukako’s and Kurisu’sand trying every single possible combination of answers before unearthing theTrue Ending—that is, if you don’t get bored to death and jump ship long before.Things are all the more confusing as this flag system is only used for the TrueEnding and it corollary, the truncated “Paradox Meltdown”, while the other fourendings use a branching path system. Maybe this is common practice in the realmof Visual Novels, but it is quite confusing for a beginner like me. 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors, which is theclosest thing to a VN I’ve played before Steins;Gate,used a branching path system and stuck to it; as a result, it was much moresatisfying to navigate and the uncovering of the various endings was muchsmoother. There was a flag of sorts to unearth, granted, but it was only asingle occurrence and it made perfect sense in the context of the narrative, soguessing what this flag was and recovering it was piece of cake. On the otherhand, the lack of cohesiveness of Steins;Gate’sending requirements and the arcane quality of its flag system forces you torely on trial-and-errors—or FAQs as a last resort—which is anything butfulfilling. And all that’s in betweenEndingsaside, Steins;Gate's narrative suffers from acouple of blatant flaws. It fortunately avoided major plot holes, but that isonly a small relief compared to the disappointment brought by these flaws,which go as such:—Ad hocoverdose: Steins;Gate relies way toomuch on ad hoc to get out of narrative binds. Okabe is stuck because he doesn’tknow the contents of Faris’ D-mail and has absolutely no way to recover them?No problem! Just let Faris gain Reading Steiner out of the blue and rememberall of a sudden events from other worldlines, even though it was previouslyestablished that only Okabe had this ability—and even though it creates moreproblems than it solves, problems that I will cover in a couple of lines. Noone can figure out the identity of Suzuha’s father? No problem! Just transformdumb-as-a-brick Mayuri into Conan Edogawa long enough to solve the matter, and—caseclosed! Yeah, right. And no, making Okabecomment on the fact that Mayuri can be “surprisingly perceptive at times” doesn’tadd a shred of believability to that most unlikely turn of events. There isalso the infamous Lukako affair that I mentioned in my first post, along withplenty of other minor occurrences that I won’t detail here to avoid boringeverybody to death—including myself. Such cheap narrative tricks are infuriating and shouldn’t be used in astoryline that presented itself from the onset as based on scientific conceptsand ruled by strict determinism. —Missedidentification to narrator: Protagonist-based first person narration issupposed to help one relate to the narrator and somehow identify to them. Itfails spectacularly in the case of Steins;Gate,and it does so for one simple reason: Okabe is an absolute MORON. There is no way I can relate and identify toa character that cannot put two and two together on a regular basis and sprouts crap such as “Twenty years from now is such a longtime, I don’t want to sacrifice my friends’ precious memories right now. Let’srather sacrifice the future of the whole humanity, yoo-hoo!” I know that thelatest theories in neuroscience claim that the parts of the brain involved indecision-making are not fully developed until age 25, but such alack of common sense and twisted sense of priorities is just ridiculous. As awhole, most of Okabe’s decisions are totally at odds with what any sensibleperson would decide in the same circumstances—and let’s not even talk about his propensity to get horny in the most inappropriate situations. Hum, couldyou forget your privates and think a little more about the fate of the worldinstead, you stupid and unrelatable main character? Jeez, I so hate being stuckin your brain. —Lack ofattention to details: Like most Vita games, Steins;Gatehas a very obvious “budget” quality. That’s okay per se: it is the Vita style,and it is kind of endearing, actually. However, it is not okay when the lack ofpolish goes as far as to undermine the narrative. There are numerous times whenthe pictures on screen blatantly contradict the text, which is simplyunacceptable in a visual novel. I’ll limit myself to one single example: inendings 2 and 3 after the return to the Beta Attractor Field, Okabe mourns thefact that Kurisu’s upgrades to the PhoneWave are gone and that the machine isback to its prior state. Yet what do we see on screen? Heck, you guessed it:the PhoneWave with all the upgrades added by Kurisu. Way to ruin the moment anddestroy its emotional impact, game! This mistake is hardly forgivable,especially since the game doesfeature pictures of the original PhoneWave; it’s not like the developers neededto create a specific picture for that scene. This is simply carelessness,carelessness that spoils the immersion. It’stime to wrap this up, folks. Although I adored Steins;Gate at first, my love sadly grew cold as chapters and endings went by. Thatgame had some incredible potential and could have been a masterclassmind-bender; instead, the writers decided to play it easy and to indulge into someromantic meanderings. Well, be it. I don’t buy it, and Steins;Gate will remain a major disappointment as far as I’mconcerned. That won’t deter me from playing more visual novels, though—and verysoon at that, because I need compensation. I need a fresh mouth washer to cleanmy palate of the bitter taste left by Steins;Gate,and that mouth washer is going to be none other than Danganronpa. I hope it will perform its duty well and give birth toa stellar review! For now, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Steins;Gate (1): First excursion ", "date": "25/07/2015", "text": "I wasplanning to analyse a couple of other games first, but these plans weredisrupted by my recent discovery of Steins;Gateand the subsequent clearing of one of the game’s six endings. This experienceleft me bewildered, my head swirling with contradictory emotions. I have to getthese feelings off my chest lest they consume me! Butbefore I do that, let’s have a few lines of data. Developed by 5pb andNitroplus, Steins;Gate is a visualnovel that started its life on the Xbox 360 back in 2009. It was then ported tovarious systems and spewed a whole array of by-products—such as an animeadaptation, a manga and so on. Steins;Gatemade its debut in Europe in 2015 with its PS3 and Vita ports—the latest beingthe one I own and played. Steins;Gatehad the distinguished honour of being the first full-blown visual novel I everplayed—but certainly not the last, perish the thought. Haunting and mesmerizingNow thatthe data part is over, let’s go back to my whirling feelings. I’ll be blunt: Iwas totally transfixed by Steins;Gate.It enthralled me and fascinated me more than any book or movie, probablybecause it combined the best of these two worlds: an glorious emphasis on text,concepts and exposition and a strong visual identity relying on a unique artstyle and the display of a few key locations that become engraved in theplayer’s mind. I swear that by the end of my run, I felt like I had spent mywhole life in in-game Akihabara, even though said in-game Akihabara was nothingmore than a couple of fixed screens; as for Okabe’s lab, it had become asfamiliar to me as my own flat. That is how incredibly evocative Steins;Gate is. I have to admit that I was a bit suspicious at first, when I discovered thatthe narrative revolved around time travel. I am old enough to have seen my fairshare of stories about the matter, and I was a trifle afraid that Steins;Gate would bring nothing new tothe fold. That fear partly materialized, but not to the extent that I dreaded. Steins;Gate reuses a lot of conceptsattached to the notion of time travel, that much is undeniable, yet it managesto combine them in an enticing way that feels fresh enough to avoid any feelingof déjà vu. Steins;Gate even steps as far as to pay homage to famous works offiction involving time traveling, from GroundhogDay to Back to the Future. Theexposition part is quite lengthy yet absolutely fascinating. As far as I’mconcerned, it was definitely the best part of the game, with its encyclopedicfeel and dedication to cover many specialized subjects, from modern physics tootaku culture. I love gorging on knowledge, and it was a sheer delight toabsorb all that data—some of it familiar, some of it brand-new to me. I alsolapped up the overall tone of these exposition chapters: they were pleasantlyself-derisive, filled with dark humor and poking fun at the otaku culture andthe obsession with conspiracy theories. That self-derisiveness is gloriouslysummed up by main character Okabe Rintaro: self-dubbed Hououin Kyouma, this collegestudent is the perfect chuunibyou, ayoung man full of himself clinging to delusions of grandeur and prone to boutsof paranoia. The rest of the crew dismiss him, sneers and pokes fun at him on aregular basis, and it was not long before I mentally started doing the same,grinning at the guy’s outlandish behaviours. Talking about the rest of thecrew, they also convey a parodic charge, although less developed that the oneshouldered by Okabe. That being said, these characters are far from being onlyparodic devices poking fun at anime tropes: they are deeply complex andinteresting characters that beg to be discovered, and they turn out to be quiteloveable despite their flaws—including unstable, near-manic Okabe. It certainlyhelps that the voice acting is nothing short of stellar, giving the whole crew anundeniable presence and charisma. I loathe voice acting in video games as arule, but I absolutely lapped it up in Steins;Gate—tothe point where I regularly hear the lines and voices of the characters ring inmy head. Loopholes (SPOILERS!)AlthoughI adored Steins;Gate, it would be alie to say that I deemed that game pristine and perfect in every aspect. There were things that rubbed me the wrongway; and not surprisingly for a visual novel, these points of contention wereall connected to the narrative. Since I only cleared one ending, it is too soonyet to assert the presence and intensity of hypothetical plot holes, so I won’tdive into that particular matter; instead, I want to expose the many smallincoherencies present in the game. These incoherencies are minor and may seemrather innocuous taken separately; but once you ingest them all over the courseof a full run, they sap the narrative and spoil the impact of the storyline. Idivided them into three mains categories that go as such:—Areyou rocket scientists or what?: If there is one thing that I thoroughlydislike while discovering a work of fiction, it’s definitely to be moreperceptive than the characters themselves and to guess things long before they do. It breaks the immersion andprevents me from being as swept away by the story as I would like. In the caseof Steins;Gate, the most gloriouslyirritating example is the Lifter issue: as soon as the crew started talkingabout the matter, I thought that the lifter was probably one of the many TVmonitors present in the Braun shop downstairs. The PhoneWave only functionsduring the shop’s opening hours, so that should ring a bell, right? Well, no.The crew spends several chapterswondering what this mysterious lifter could be, and even supposedly geniusscientist Kurisu doesn’t have a clue about the matter. Also, how can they notfigure out that the supposed satellite imbedded in the Radi-kan building is verylikely a time machine after having seen the PhoneWave go through the floor in similarfashion? They saw with their own eyes that a time machine “gainsmass for unknown reasons” while operating, as Okabe himself states it, so why don’t they makethe connection when I, reader/player, can make it without a hassle? Honestly, Ifind a trifle hard to take these characters seriously when it turns out that Ican outwit them on a regular basis. (EDIT: after finishing the game, it turned out that these two facts are not related at all. Suzuha's machine is embedded in the building because the destination coordinates were a bit off, and the extra weight gained by the PhoneWave while operating is never refered to again. So not only was this weight matter totally useless as far as the plot was concerned, but it also allowed me to spot from afar what should undoubtedly have been one of the game's main plot twists. Great job, writers.)—Adhoc arrangements with realism: AKA the Lukako affair. You seriously want meto believe that Lukako has the exact samephysical appearance as a male and as a female? This is just… dumb. Dumb, andutterly lazy to boot. I’m starting to suspect that these similar looks are onlya plot device to justify the fondling scene that occurs after Lukako’s sexchange, and let me tell you: if it turns out to be the case, then I’m going tobe intensely pissed off. Like, therewill be blood. I will forgive this sheer display of complacency only if it turns out that Okabe is anUnreliable Narrator and that the whole narrative is only a mad fantasy bornfrom the darkest recesses of his mind. Likewise, why does Faris still sport hercat ears, maid outfit and irritating “nyans” even after her D-Mail eradicated alltrace of moe culture in Akibahara? That makes absolutely no sense. I could alsomention the fact that Kurisu, who started the game giving conferences aboutmodern physics, suddenly produces a PhD in neurosciences from thin air when thenarrative calls for it. Hum, isn’t that a little bit too convenient? And these are only a few of many, many similaroccurrences. —Howcould you miss that?: This category is the worst of the bunch, because itinvolves the characters not reacting to keys elements that they should react to. The most blatant andshocking example is the scene in which Suzuha exhorts Okabe to be wary ofKurisu; during that scene, Suzuha states that Kurisu is widely acknowledged asthe creator of the time machine. When this happened, I stood gaping at thescreen, my eyes bulging and my head spinning: this was as good as a confessionfrom Suzuha—a confession that, as we suspected, she was hailing from THEFUTURE!!! And guess what Okabe does when hearing that bombshell? Well, I’lltell you: nothing. He doesn’t react. Hedoesn’t even seem to register theinformation. Why on earth…? I’msorry, but this is just too hard to swallow, even in the hypothetical contextof a twisted narration by Okabe. Still, I hope there will be at least anattempt of sorts to justify this massive incoherency at some point, or I willbe even more sorely disappointed. These incoherencies aside, my main and biggest gripe with Steins;Gate is the subtle yet unmissablechange of the narrative’s tone as the story progresses. I resent the game forslowly but surely becoming the very thing that it seemed to be taking the piss out of at first, i.e. a very classic and cliché Japanese anime storyline rife withtropes—the very tropes that were cleverly parodied in the exposition chapters,of all tropes! Oh, the dismay! And yet it is hardly deniable: our teenage characters(check) unearth a global conspiracy totally by happenstance (check) and putthemselves in hot water in the process, which creates a strong and enduringfriendship bond between them (check). As the story progresses, they try theirhardest to shed any shred of subtlety and turn into complete anime tropes:Kurisu goes from clever, witty scientist to tsundere, Mayushi gets dumber andairier by the chapter, Daru goes from super-hacker to perverted otaku and Moekaturns out to be a secret agent—who obviously finds herself holding our heroesat gunpoint while donning a tight leather jumpsuit. Why, of course! And whatabout dear old Okabe, you may ask? Well, Okabe starts playing god and suddenlydevelops some romantic interest for its female comrades. I guess I should haveseen it coming, given the increasing frequency of hentai sequences over thecourse of the game. Okabe peeping at the girls in the shower by accident, Okabefondling Lukako’s privates, Suzuha stripping to put Okabe out of a bind, Lukakodonning a skimpy cosplay outfit: you name them, Steins;Gate has them. After the delicious binging of data providedby the exposition chapters, this turn of events stings. HARD. On top of that, some perfectly decentself-derisiveness was wasted in the process: all the delicious irony displayedin the exposition is reduced to naught as both the characters and the narrativeabandon the parodic sphere to move into full-blown cliché territory. Forinstance, Okabe’s hilarious chuunibyou-nessautomatically loses all its satirical charge when it turns out that, drums rolling, there is a globalconspiracy after all and he’s the one who uncovers it. That is a terriblewaste, if you ask me, and definitely not what I had signed for. Thatbeing said, my final judgement about that tone issue is actually still pending.I only uncovered one ending out of the six, and I still have to discover ifOkabe is an Unreliable Narrator and if everything that happens in Steins;Gate is a product of his derangedmind. If that were the case, the initial irony of the game would not only besalvaged, but also grow more potent and enjoyable. Although I honestly dislikedseeing the narrative morph into a cliché anime storyline, this evolution wouldtake a whole new meaning and regain its parodic charge with full force if itwere caused by Okabe’s chuunibyou-ness.So I will wait, and hope for the best. Irreversible Reboot (SPOILERS!)“IrreversibleReboot”, a.k.a. \"Suzuha Ending\", is the fifth ending of Steins;Gateand the one that I unearthed after six chapters and roughly fifteen hours of assiduous reading and button-pressing. This is a very unsatisfactory ending that ends on a nastycliffhanger and raises more questions than it answers. On top of that, it feelsboth quite abrupt and awfully rushed: the time loop occurrence at the end ofthe timeline seems to come out of left field and is not really explored indepth. Okabe’s sudden romantic interest for Suzuha is hardly more believableand gives the narrative a mundane touch that is not exactly welcome at thepoint of the story, when the tension is supposed to be at its peak. The rest ofthe crew is neatly ousted in order to concentrate on this brand-newidyll—including Mayuri, whom Okabe was striving so hard to save from death justa few minutes before. Fickle crazy scientist is fickle! As for the cliffhangerat the very end, this is just downright sadistic, and I can only hope that theoutcome of Okabe and Suzuha’s ultimate decision will be exposed one way oranother in one of the other five endings. Talkingabout the other five endings—which I obviously want to witness—I startedwondering how difficult it would be to unearth them. Given the game’sinsistence on the Butterfly Effect concept and given how reduced the gameplayinput is, I suspected that the timeline branching would be influenced by minutechoices, and that hunch was confirmed by the browsing of a couple of FAQs. Thequestion now is to determine whether I try to navigate the game all by myselfor if I rely on FAQ charts. If there is any kind of logic behind the mandatorychoices to make for each timeline, I’m pretty confident that I can uncover itwith enough patience; on the other hand, if these choices are completelyrandom, then I don’t even want to think about trying to pinpoint them, and I will run straight to a time-savingFAQ. Thedecision is still pending for the time being. The idea of navigating the gameall by myself is undeniably tempting; even though it would imply taking notes,using save files by the truckload and globally losing a lot of time trying tofigure out how the game operates, it would also be a thrilling challengedeliciously reminiscent of old gaming days, when internet was not around to getyou out of a bind and you could only rely on your own brain cells. On theother hand, the use of FAQs would allow me to immerse completely in thestoryline and to enjoy it to the fullest. I have to admit that the idea of playingthe game with the Skip mode on is seriously off-putting; I’d rather reread thefull story every time and get soaked in the engrossing atmosphere of Steins;Gate. There will be at least one more post about Steins; Gate, if notmore, although I don’t know when these posts will come. For the time being, Iam taking a small break from the game and digesting the whole experience; but Iwill dive back into it in a couple of days— after having printed a couple of FAQcharts just to be safe. For now, thanks for reading and be my guestanytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon X: A certain je ne sais quoi ( a.k.a. the Delphox Solo Run )", "date": "12/07/2015", "text": "Since Pokemon Diamond and its mellow, friendlygameplay had proven to be the perfect accompaniment to my 2014 summer holiday,I decided to reproduce the experience this year. No need to change a winningformula, right? As my Pokemon game ofthe summer, I elected Pokemon X, agame that has been sitting untouched in my collection since, well… lastsummer.  First Pokemon iterations to grace the 3ds, Pokemon X and its twin Pokemon Y were developed by Game Freakand released worldwide in 2013, and were welcome by raving reviews. Criticscelebrated the many innovations offered by the pair as well as the overallbeauty of the game world—which was not based on aJapanese region like in most of the previous entries, but rather on the northern half ofFrance. This, for me, was definitelythe main attraction of Pokemon X.For, lo and behold, it is time to reveal another dirty little secret: I amactually of French descent, mesdames etmessieurs. Although I’ve not been living in the country for a good numberof years and only have the scantest knowledge of its northern half, I stillknow my way around more than enough to spot all things French in the vibrantworld of Kalos. And boy, did I spot some! Kalos is more French than I had dared to dream of, to my utter delight—but also,occasionally, to my mild annoyance. I’ll expend on the overwhelming frenchnessof Pokemon X later; for now, let’s startwith a nice, juicy account of my run.The Fennekin Solo RunMy solo run, should I rightly say. Youdidn’t expect less, did you? Although I had vaguely considered tackling aNuzlocke run, I changed my mind when I discovered the starters. The littleFennekin was so adorable that I decided to play the whole game with her, and itsucceeded beyond my wildest expectations. My Fennekin—affectionately renamedFenny— soared all the way to Lv.100 over the course of my run, evolving fromBraixen to Delphox. I was actually a trifle disappointed by this particularevolution process: I am not too fond of anthropomorphic Pokemons, and to seethat lovely little fennec turn into a shabby-looking humanoid fox was reallynot to my retina’s liking. However, the unsatisfying looks of my Fennekin weremore than compensated by her amazing fighting performances. She gained levelsat the speed of light and no obstacles could stand in our way—to the pointwhere the game actually became nearly too easy. By the time I reached Siebold,member of the Elite Four, wielder of Water Pokemons and thus only trainer whocould have posed a serious threat, my Fennekin was so over-levelled that shecould take down his ’Mons in one shot with firemoves. Talk about a serious unbalance of forces! Still, the overall experiencewas awesome, leaving me with sweet lingering feelings just like the Diamond/Pearl/Platinum trio didin its days. I get a warm glow in my chest every time I think about theseeventful 20-or-so hours spent playing X,and it certainly won’t be too long before I tackle its twin Pokemon Y. I onlyencountered a couple of minor annoyances during that delightful solo run of Pokemon X. First, I was sorely disappointedto discover that the famed Mega Evolution was not available for all Pokemons.Why introduce an awesome new feature only to dole it out to a precious few? MyFennekin was unfortunately not part of that lucky lot, hence thedisappointment. Sure, the story forced on me a Lucario that could mega-evolve,so Mega-Evolution was available after all; but since I had decided to playsolo, that didn’t change anything as far as my run was concerned. Another minorannoyance was that I couldn’t figure out for the life of me how thePokemon-Amie feature worked. There was no tutorial whatsoever, and fiddlingwith the system didn’t yield any convincing result, so I quickly gave up andstopped touching the thing entirely. Not using Pokemon-Amie didn’t hamper my progressionin the slightest, mind you; but if someone masters this puzzling application,they are more than welcome to enlighten me. Such knowledge could be put to gooduse in my future run of Pokemon Y! Ona very trivial note, I was also disappointed by the absence of yummy treats tospoil ’Mons, such as Diamond/Pearl’s Poffins. This was a nice touch,and I would have loved to find it in X—allthe more so as the French setting could have provided the most mouth-wateringinspiration. How delightful would it have been to treat my ’Mons to sticky nougat bites or soft calissons! Now that’s a missed opportunityhere, dear Game Freak. (Edit: after a bit of research, I discovered that there are treats after all, but you can only feed them to your 'Mons through the Pokemon-Amie application. Now that gives me a good incentive to learn to use the thing.) On thenarrative side, I was really not fond of the resident rival. Said rival is supposedto be my next door neighbour, a freak of sorts who decides on the very day ofmy arrival in town that we will be rivals in all things Pokemons. Well, excuseme, but who are you? And why do youantagonize me in such manner? Yet after that, they take that whole rival businessso quietly and matter-of-factly that you’d swear that they are actuallytackling an assignment for school. There is no passion, no fire, no competitivestreak: it just feels like business-as-usual. Seriously, I’d have over-excitedBarry from Diamond/Pearl ten times over this transparent X rival whose name I cannot evenremember. I could also mention thatbunch of useless kids that somehow ended up stuck to my soles like dirty old piecesof gum, stalking me from town to town during my whole run and ruining thethrill of exploring Kalos as a lone ranger. To close this litany of minorannoyances, I have to admit that I was somewhat disturbed by the faintinganimations of defeated ’Mons, which were a trifle too detailed for my comfort.Granted, we all know that under the series’ cute varnish lies a brutal gameplayand that the road to the Elite Four is littered with Pokemons pummeled intooblivion, but was it really necessary to show the painful fainting of these innocent creatures in such exquisite details? I couldn’t help but feel a pangof guilt at the end of every fight—but maybe that was the purpose, after all. Maybethe game wants you to remember the price of becoming the best Pokemon Trainerever, which is a lot of suffering inflicted on the very creatures you claim tolove more than anything. Or maybe I’m just extrapolating wildly. Oh, well. The unmissable Frenchness of KalosAfterthis account of my run, let’s now fully explore the frenchness of Pokemon X, ladies and gentlemen. TsunekazuIshihara, CEO of the Pokemon Company, has stated in an interview that \"Franceis one of the many countries that has a focus on the beauty, and beauty was oneof the themes that we had with Pokémon X and Y, so we wanted to see how wecould express that beauty in the games\". Well, they certainly managed toconvey beauty in a brilliant way in X.I was truly in awe more than once while discovering the game’s many gorgeousvistas, and it certainly dazzled me much more than Diamond/Pearl. From thePalace of Versailles to the Mont Saint-Michel, from the Eiffel Tower to the Jura Mountains, without forgetting a slice of palm tree-laced Southern France, many real-life locations wereincluded into the game to great effect. I had never associated the Pokemon series with staggering beauty,but that certainly changed with Pokemon X.Beautyaside, Game Freak definitely knew their France. They probably did an awful lotof research on the spot, for they managed to nail the French atmosphere quiteperfectly. Pokemon X feelsexquisitely, achingly French, fromthe many different architectural styles to the flora, from the emphasis onstyle and fashion—with the delightful option to change your trainer’s clothesand haircut—to the omnipresence of coffeehouses and restaurants. There isdefinitely a very French je ne sais quoi,a unique brand of sophistication that sets the game apart from itspredecessors.  This French atmosphere wasso pregnant that it generated in me an intense wave of nostalgia and a longingfor all things French. Somehow, I’m glad that the game didn’t include Frenchfood after all, or the craving would have become unbearable. I wonder if Japaneseplayers experience such intense feelings when playing Pokemon entries based on Japanese regions? They probably do,actually. Gee, what a treat it must be to play Pokemon when you hail from Japan! Thatbeing said, injecting a hefty dose of frenchness into the Pokemon series didn’t yield only pleasant results. My main gripewith X and its French-soakedatmosphere is the fact that exploration took a serious step back in theprocess. There are more towns than in previous entries, and the wild areas spreadingbetween said towns have been considerably reduced as well as substantiallymanicured, in the pure tradition of the French formal garden. As a result,Kalos appears as a mesh of cities separated by small patches of tamed landscaperather than a compact rural region with a handful of towns acting as welcomeresting points. Visiting towns is not as thrilling as exploring wilderness, andI really missed the whole exploration factor in X. In fact, this overabundance of towns and the presence of manymonuments inspired by their real-life French counterparts made me feel like Iwas touring Kalos rather than exploring it—a feeling reinforced by the new “PhotoSpot” feature. Everything was so polished, so pristine, so manicured that evenpeaceful Sinnoh feels like a cutthroat untamed area compared to Kalos. This isnot bad per se, it’s just… disconcerting. That feeling of being on a tourcertainly fits the reality of France, which is no less than the most visitedcountry in the world; but I am not too sure that I enjoyed seeing that touristicaura somewhat transposed in a Pokemongame. Oh, well.Apartfrom that main gripe, a couple of details rubbed me the wrong way for being on... the dark side of France, shall we say. France is not all roses and sunshine, andwhoever decided to include the most unpleasant aspects of French life in Pokemon X should be severely punished.Lo and behold, here is the list of offenders:—Hotelsand coffeehouses up the wazoo: The presence of hotels in every town certainly fits thetouristic reality of France; as for coffeehouses, or cafés, they are pretty much the epicentre of French city life. Thisall contributes to the French touchof Kalos allright; the problem lies in the fact that apart from contributingthat French touch, these places haveno purpose at all. You cannot sleep in the hotels nor order food or drinks inthe cafés; the only thing you can dois talk to the few patrons present, which is not especially thrilling. These cafés and hotels are but empty shells,and another missed opportunity to implement interesting gameplay features; andto add insult to injury, there are a tonof them in Kalos. Lumiose City alone hosts a good dozen of cafés! Jeez, what a waste of space. —Tipping till you're broke:Oh, the horror of it all! Tipping is one of the most annoying French customs, aform of brainwashing so ingrained in the culture that most French people feel terriblyguilty if they don’t leave tips in coffeehouses or restaurants—despite the factthat service charges are comprised in the meal’s price. Whoever decided toimplement a tipping feature in X isnot only downright sadistic, but overzealous as well: even French people do nottip outside of the food business. So why should I tip the butler that gave me atour of a mansion? That’s not French tipping, that’s throwing your moneythrough the window. And just like in real life, tipping doesn’t bring youanything apart from the supposed gratitude of the recipient. That may be finein real life, but not in a video game: when I saw that tipping didn’t yield anydiscernable benefits, I stopped doing it entirely. —Lumiosebloody City: Pardon my French, but… Quel bordel!Lumiose City is one hot mess, as pleasant to navigate as real-life Paris—thatis, not quite. The similar looks of streets and the constantly shifting cameraangles make for a really disorienting experience, and finding your way can moreoften than not turn into a full-blown challenge. That uncomfortable situationwas probably noticed by the developers themselves, since they implemented a taxi service todrive you wherever you want in Lumiose… for a fee just as onerous as the onescharged by real-life taxi drivers in Paris. I swear that I wept inside everytime I needed to set foot in Lumiose City. Thatbeing said, I’m starting to wonder if these points may have irritated me preciselybecause I know France to some extent. I’d be curious to know if other playerswere annoyed as well by said points or if they find them charming and saw themas pleasantly exotic slices of French life. Feel free to share your feelingsabout the matter, dear fellow gamers! At any rate, although I blamed more thanI praised in this post—in terms of number of lines, that is—I can assure youthat I really adored Pokemon X. Ithas its flaws, but it was still a delightful experience through and through. Itwas actually more enjoyable than the Diamond/Pearl pair despite the relative lack ofexploration, and I will certainly indulge into more strolls through Kalossooner or later. Maybe before the end of the summer, who knows? And now, if youdon’t mind, I’m going to indulge in a giant bite of smelly French cheese, alongwith fresh baguette, and daydreamabout my adventures in Kalos. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Coveted games: Summer games ’15", "date": "05/07/2015", "text": "It is nosecret that summer is usually a quiet time as far as game releases areconcerned. Usually, but not always: for some reason, a lot of appetizing gamesare slated for release this summer, with release dates spreading evenly fromJuly till September. Well, I am certainly not complaining; I have already purchaseda good number of games in June, new releases as well as games a few months oldthat I didn’t get the opportunity to buy sooner, and I’m firmly planning to buymore before the summer is over.Without further ado, here are my coveted games for the season! Lord of Magna: Maiden Heaven (3ds): To be honest, I am not too sure Ifully understand the concept of that game. Is it supposed to be an RPG? Asimulation? A mix of both? Things are a trifle unclear, if you ask me. At anyrate, it looks interesting, and I have this peculiar fondness for Marvelousafter liking a couple of their games, which led to an unavoidable purchase. Andsince I own a North-American 3ds, I went for the physical version.Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3: VGeneration (Vita): Idiscovered the series for good a couple of weeks ago when I cleared the firstVita instalment and absolutely adoredit. (There’s a review in the pipeline, obviously.) As a result, every Hyperdimension entry became highlydesirable, and that obviously includes Re;Birth3—which is a remake of a PS3 game, just like the two other Re;Birth episodes released on the Vitabefore it. I am already itching to play Re;Birth2, so I’m certainly not going to wait months before buying this thirdepisode. Senran Kagura 2: Deep Crimson (3ds): As I said above, I have a peculiar fondnessfor Marvelous, and I certainly commend their efforts to bring a large varietyof physical editions of SKB’s sequelto Europe. These editions will be printed on demand, and I definitely wouldlike to see more publishers adopt that particular practice. All praise aside, Ireally loved the first SKB entry,which automatically makes the second a must-have. It looks even flashier,campier and bustier than the first one, and I’m fully expecting a gloriousfestival of over-the-topness. Bring it on, Marvelous!   Lost Dimension (Vita): I was interested by this game’sdescription at first, before becoming instantly suspicious when I discoveredits uncanny visual resemblance with FreedomWars. I expected a similar gameplay involving full-blown 3D andfirst-person vision, which would have made LostDimension an absolute no-go; fortunately, I was in for a pleasant surpriseas the game finally turned out to be a tactical RPG à la Valkyria Chronicles. This will certainly be easier to stomachfor my touchy balance system; and although I’m not too fond of Lost Dimension’s art style, I cancertainly tolerate it if the game is really good—which I hope it will be, forI’m definitely buying it. Danganronpa: Another Episode: Ultra DespairGirls (Vita): I ownthe first two instalments already, so this one must obviously become part of mycollection too. The fact that I yet have to play any of these games is but amere detail, really; something tells me I am going to like them anyway. Mygaming instinct sometimes failed me, but I still trust it to the core. Xenoblade Chronicles 3D (3ds): Granted, I don’t own a New 3ds justyet. However, I’m really curious about that game, if only because of the wholemystique that surrounds it. The notion of a series that somehow collapsed underits own glorious weight is strangely alluring, and I certainly want to see formyself what the fuss is all about. I will thus purchase that game, and shelveit until I get my hands on a New 3ds. Ar Nosurge Plus: Ode to an Unborn Star (Vita): I’ve heard about that game onlyvery lately; but since it turned out to be an RPG, it instantly gained a spotin that summer list of coveted games. This sci-fi-oriented RPG will not benefitfrom a physical release, which saddens me a bit; but that is the way things arenowadays. That being said, a digital release is still better than no release atall, so I’m not really complaining. There will probably be a good bargain onthat game sooner or later, so it’s just a matter of lurking in the shadows andwaiting for the right moment to purchase it. Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess (Vita): I initially thought that this gamewould be released on the PS4 only and I was mourning the absence of a Vitaversion—that is, until I learnt that there wouldbe a Vita version after all, only digitally released. I’m actually quite happyand relieved, and I will wait for my moment, ready to jump at the perfectbargain. Thatmakes seven games on my radar for the summer—which is a quite a hefty number,given the season. Needless to say, I’m elated! On a more general note, I’vebeen playing an awful lot lately; as a result, I have a handful of games todissect, and I’m planning to do so in the next weeks. It was actually refreshingto get that writing break: although it was mostly forced on me by externalcircumstances, it allowed me to rest pleasantly and to reconsider the wholeblogging thing with a new and fresh eye. I can now dive back into writing withrenewed energy and gusto, but also with a lighter heart. I guess even one’shobbies can use a little break every now and then! So, dear fellow gamers, I’llsee you soon with meatier posts. For now, thanks for reading, and be my guestanytime!"},
{"title": "Gaming Haul: Foreign affair", "date": "28/06/2015", "text": "Back tobusiness! Well, somehow. Let’s face it: I’ve not been writing a word for awhole month now, and as a result, I feel a trifle… rusty. Before diving backinto full-blown reviews and analyses, I am thus going to warm up with thiseasy-going, self-indulgent post about my latest gaming loot. Said loot tookplace on some foreign grounds where I dwelt a couple of days lately—foreigngrounds that provided me with a much larger choice of games than my homegrounds, to my utter delight. Without further ado, here is my latest catch! Pokemon Alpha Sapphire/Omega Ruby (3ds): I’ve been longing for thiscrystalline pair since their release last autumn, but somehow never found theright moment to purchase them. Said right moment finally came in June, whenthey appeared in front of my eyes in all their glory, sitting proudly togetheron a display rack. My heart swelled with joy, and before I knew it, the twowere part of my collection. Finally!Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate (3ds): I had my doubts about that game,if you remember well. I wrote something about wanting to check carefully if the3D used in that monster-slaughtering fest could be stomached by my weak,3D-sensitive balance system. Well, all caution went down the drain and I wasstruck by a sudden bout of amnesia as I picked that game from the display rack,transfixed by its gorgeous cover art, and shoved it into my shopping basket. Ihad not faced physical games in a shopfor many months, and… I was overwhelmed by my hunting urges. Let’s hope that thisprey will not turn back on me!Kirby: Triple Deluxe (3ds): Despite the fact that the Kirby series is one of the only seriesof Platformers that I ever truly loved,this game was never really part of any of my numerous lists of coveted games.This unexpected purchase can be blamed solely on my summer fondness for kawaisa—a fondness that also stroke lastsummer, leading me to purchase HyperdimensionNeptunia: Producing Perfection. The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask 3D (3ds): Ironically enough, I encountered awhole wall of these infamous Majora’sMask golden 3ds in a shop, normally priced and ready for the taking. Iguess the shortage is over then! Not that I really cared, mind you; what Iwanted was the game alone, which I found without any hassle. Now I can see if Majora’s Mask deserves its cult classicstatus… When I feel in the mood for it, that is.Fossil Fighters Frontier (3ds): A brand-new series for me! I hadheard about this Pokemon-meets-Jurassic Park formula repeatedly in the lastmonths and had grown curious about it; and when I finally found myself face toface with the thing, I decided to give it a go. Discovering new series isalways the thrill, and I hope that FossilFighters will live up to my expectations!   Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters (Vita): Despite receiving lukewarmreviews, this game was available in several game shops, unlike other games I fullyexpected to find (more on that later). Since I had decided to purchase it nomatter what and since it was so pleasantly there,I leaped at the opportunity and added it to my fast-growing Vita collection.Operation Abyss: New Tokyo Legacy (Vita): Another game that received tepidreviews yet was available in nearly every shop I visited. (Every shop that hada Vita display, that is; more on that later.) Is the word “Tokyo” supposed tobe a beacon of sorts guaranteeing glorious sales? Anyway, same scenario asabove: this game was part of my last list of coveted games and it was mine forthe taking, and I certainly didn’t miss the chance to purchase it.Steins;Gate (Vita): I had little to no hope of finding a physicalcopy of Steins;Gate, a game that hasremained rather confidential since its release despite garnering stellarreviews. I was thus overwhelmed with joy when I managed to unearth a copy froma display rack. I should actually say THE copy, for not only was there only one copy in the whole shop, but thislone copy was also the only copy of Steins;GateI encountered during my whole trip. Nowthat is what I call good hunting! Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed(Vita): Just likein the case of Steins;Gate, Iencountered only a lone copy of that game, which I promptly secured. I hadreservations about that Hyperdimensionspin-off a couple of months ago; however, I played the series’ first instalmentlately and completely adored it, and Action Unleashed became an instantmust-have in the process. Finding it physical was a huge stroke of luck andmakes it all the more precious. Oh, the joys of hunting for games! Well,that was quite a good harvest—more fructuous than last year, to my utterdelight. I managed to get my hands on a good number of 3ds games, which isquite a pleasant change and should be celebrated. It is heart-warming to seethe 3ds get some love and good games at last, and I am definitely planning toplay some of my latest catch before the end of the summer. An interesting trendI noticed during my visit in shops is the prominence of Inazuma Eleven games: they were everywhere, gloriously advertisedas if they were the next best thing to Pokemon—whichthey probably are, actually. I don’t remember seeing so many of these games orseeing them advertised so thoroughly last year, and to be honest, I was just that close to purchasing one of them.However, the high price and the prospect of not liking the series stopped me,and I decided to be reasonable and to resort to the surefire “old entry testtechnique” which had worked so well with the Pokemon series: to purchase a cheap old instalment of Inazuma Eleven to test the waters. If itturns out that I love that series, there is going to be a serious Inazuma shopping rampage at some point,let me tell you that.On theother hand, I noticed a rather worrying trend as I was prowling shops in searchof games. I visited supermarkets, semi-specialized shops and full-blown gameshops, and one fact was undeniable: the shelf space allotted to Vita games isdangerously shrinking. It was already not that glorious last year, but thingsseem to be getting worse by the month. Not surprisingly, supermarkets wereentirely devoid of any Vita games while stocking the latest 3ds hits; as for specialized and semi-specialized shops, they did have Vita display racks,but these racks were really not that massive, and the choice they offered wasquite scarce. For instance, I fully expected to get my hands on Hyperdevotion Noire during the course ofmy trip; however, it was absolutely nowhere to be found. It is not that bad per se, since this game can be found easilyon the internet; but this situation is a tad uncomfortable and may be quiterevelatory. The fact that Vita shop space is shrinking while the system hasbeen literally showered with games for a year and a half now makes me thinkthat it may become increasingly hard to get one’s hand on physical Vita gamesin the months and years to come. My guess is that Vita games will disappearfrom shelves the very minute the system ceases to be produced, which means thatcollecting for the Vita is an activity that must be undertaken right now, whilethe system is still alive and—relatively—well. The Vita is no Nintendo DS:finding Vita games is already quite tedious right now, and it may become excruciatinglyhard, if not nearly impossible, once the system’s production stops entirely.Maybe I’m being too pessimistic; but just to be sure, I will stop delaying myVita purchases. I won’t step as far as day-one purchases or pre-orders, but Icertainly won’t wait months before purchasing coveted games—especially now thatthe Vita is slowly but surely heading towards the end of its life. Allgaming trends aside, my summer 2015 catch was a fairly good one, and I’mdefinitely planning to clear a couple of these promising games by the end ofthe summer, if not all of them. Highlyunlikely, but who knows? Hope springs eternal in the heart of the gamer with anenormous backlog! For now, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},

{"title": "Golden Sun: The cult classic I was waiting for", "date": "25/05/2015", "text": "I’vebeen recently mourning the fact that I had not yet found a Gameboy Advance cultclassic worthy of the name, and lo and behold! Such a game came my way, to myutter delight. The cultclassic in question is none other than GoldenSun, the debut instalment of a relatively young RPG series. Developed byCamelot Software Planning and released in 2001(jp/na) and 2002, this incipitmet immediate critical success and was praised vigorously. It was initiallyplanned as a single game, supposedly on the Nintendo 64, but focus shiftedduring development and the game was moved to the GBA. Because of the system’slimitations, what was initially a single game had to be cut in two and ended upas a pair of games instead, Golden Sunbeing the first half of that pair. GoldenSun: The Lost Age came out a couple of years later, followed by Golden Sun: Dark Dawn on the DS, anothercouple of years later. You could nearly say that this trilogy came to life byaccident: planned as a single game, it finally became a series of sort. Worsethings have happened, especially in an industry where countless games arecancelled during development and never see the light of day. More classic than you’d wishTruth betold, while Golden Sun boasts all thenecessary qualities to be hailed as a cult classic, it still remains a very,well… classic RPG at heart, in theslightly disparaging acception of the word. More specifically, Golden Sun dutifully follows templateslaid down by 8-bit and 16-bit era RPGs, graphically as well as in terms ofgameplay. As a matter of fact, the same could be said of most GBA games, somuch so that it’s easy to view the system as a portable SNES of sorts. Whileemulating the style of a console six years dead is hardly a way to establish asystem’s own brand of gaming, the limitations of the GBA left little choice inthe matter; on the other hand, such a style must have delighted the thenburgeoning retro scene that was rediscovering bit-era classics throughemulation. But I digress; let’s go back to GoldenSun and its heavy dose of early ’90s RPG classicism.Golden Sun’s presentation, for one thing, is pure 16-bitRPG fare mingled with a touch of 8-bit-ness. The gorgeous and lush pixelatedgraphics, all vivid colours and smooth stylized shapes, would not have been outof place in an SNES game, all the more so as the world map boasts some rotatingeffects reminiscent of the SNES’ famous Mode 7. Interestingly enough, saidworld map is also heavily reminiscent of 8-bit RPGs: not only can it be roamedfreely, but it only accommodates a single way of travelling, namely yourcharacters’ own two feet. No boat or airship to make your roaming easier andfaster: if you want to rally a place, you’ll have to do so by trotting aroundon the world map. (As you’d expect, this can take an awfully long time, and Iwas quite surprised to see such a retrograde take on travelling in what wassupposedly a high-profile GBA game. Oh, well.) Then there is the soundtrack,which, in pure 16-bit tradition, is a pure gem designed with great care, asplendid collection of ear-candy. All tracks are gorgeous and convey deepemotions, and they are used in a perfectly apropos way, subtly enhancingstorytelling as well as the player’s feelings. Some of the tracks ended upfastened in my memory, playing in my head every now and then: this is certainlya nice change from some more modern games I’ve played lately, with theirsoundtracks so vanilla and/or irritating that I had to turn off the volumeeventually.Golden Sun’s gameplay, for another, borrows heavily from16-bit era templates. The strongest influence is definitely the Legend of Zelda series: with its heavyfocus on exploration, regular gain of new abilities allowing you to progressfurther, puzzle-solving and backtracking to explore areas that were unreachableat first, Golden Sun could aptly bedescribed as a turn-based take on the Zeldagameplay mechanics. A somewhat looser take, though: puzzles and the acquisitionof new abilities are not nearly as systematic and streamlined as in the Zelda games, leading to a more sprawledstructure in which both puzzles and new abilities pop up at random. The pureRPG side is not forgotten, though: from classes to elemental invocations togood old random turn-based battles, without forgetting the obligatorygeographical variations—the remote location buried in snow and ice, the dry andhot desert, the mysterious and vaguely dangerous forest, the bit of oceansailing and so on—everything that defined and made 16-bit RPGs famous can befound in Golden Sun, whole anduntouched. And yet, inside all this RPG classicism hides an unexpected dose oforiginality: invisible at first sight, it reveals itself as soon as one poresover the game in earnest. More original than you’d thinkGolden Sun’s most prominent twist to the classic 16-bitRPG formula is to have successfully paired random turn-based combat and a classsystem with Zelda-lite puzzles andability-based progression, thus bridging the gap between traditional RPG andAction-Adventure games and creating a hybrid of sorts. That was quite a riskymove, for these elements do not necessarily go well together: being interruptedevery couple of second by a random fight that takes away your overall view ofthe action is not exactly conducive to efficient puzzle-solving—as anyone whoplayed Tales of Hearts R surely knows.Yet Golden Sun manages to circumventthat obstacle by a simple and neat trick: puzzles rooms are entirely devoid ofrandom encounters, allowing you to focus on the puzzle at hand. Butthere is more: the fighting system and class system are both intimately tied toexploration and ability-based progression rather than to good ol' level-grinding. This boils down to the presenceof the “Djinns”: these tiny and rather cute creatures spread all around thegame world—some in plain view and others cleverly hidden—can grant you accessto new classes, the general rule being that the Djinns of one element are tiedto one specific class. The more Djinns you collect, the more classes you canaccess, which in turn gives a great incentive to explore the game world andleave no stone unturned. This creates a virtuous circle in which carefulexploration—including assiduous backtracking, as some of the Djinns can bereached only later in the game after gaining some specific abilities—allows youto strengthen your party and thus to progress smoothly, discovering more Djinnson the way—and so on. Level-grinding takes a huge step back: sure, you stillgain levels and see your stats rising, but those levels will only be useful ifyou have the necessary Djinns to don a given class and the specifics attacksand abilities that go with it. This can actually create some minor issues, aswe will see very soon; but minor issues or not, this system is brilliant andwell-crafted, tying together elements that have been somewhat at odds since thedawn of the Holy Realm of RPG. Ofcourse, such a new and daring formula had to present a couple of flaws: firsttries are hardly ever perfect, after all. GoldenSun’s Djinn-based class system has a weakness that can have direconsequences: should you miss some Djinns, you may not access some classes andthus some spells that could be tremendously important at some point in thegame. As you probably guessed already, I landed in this very situation over thecourse of my run. I ended up being stranded in the final boss fight, of allplaces; all that because I had missed one Djinn. One single Djinn, and the onlyone I missed during my run; but this was a Mercury Djinn tied to Mia, and nothaving it entirely prevented Mia from learning any Group Healing spells. Giventhat no other character has access to such spells and that there are no grouphealing items, I was basically stuck at End Game’s doors, unable to beat thefinal boss because I was missing those precious Group Healing spells. (I triedto make do without, mind you; unfortunately, it became obvious quite quicklythat I stood no chance without a good, solid Group Healing spell.) Of course, Iwas not entirely stuck: I could havebacktracked in order to find that precious and elusive missing MercuryDjinn—even though I had no idea where it hid—and I would have gained the GroupHealing spells as soon as it was added to my pool of Djinns. However, I hadalready played a good 25 hours at that point, and the thought of adding acouple of hours solely devoted to backtracking was more than I could bear, so Ipurely and simply gave up. I’ll do better on my next run, I promise.Anotherminor issue is the use of Djinns in battle, which is too complex for its owngood and ends up being counter-productive. Here is an overall view: whilefighting, you have the choice between regular spells tied to your class of themoment, weak but available at every turn, and Djinn spells and invocations,more powerful but only available every couple of turns. To put it simply, thisis a case of “you cannot have your cake and eat it too”: somehow, you have tochoose between focusing on your regular spells or on the Djinn-based attacks. Unleashingboth at random may put you in hot water, because using the Djinns in combat can change your class, replacing a set of class-tied spells by another oneentirely. I won't go into the technicalities of how this can happen, if only because I am not quite sure I fully understood them; suffice it to say that it can happen indeed. Just imagine losing your Healing spells all of a sudden in the middleof a boss fight and you’ll have a good idea of how impractical this can be. Inmost RPGs, the unleashing of invocations or any other devastating attack istied to a special gauge that fills up gradually as you fight, which is bothmore convenient and more rewarding; why the developers of Golden Sun chose rather to go with this unserviceable system of sacrificingyour class to gain access to the most powerful attacks is beyond me. I guess itwas designed as a way to introduce a dose of strategy in the fighting, but itcomes across as messy and unreliable. As a result, I focused mostly on theregular class-tied spells, using invocations only in case of dire need—i.e.during boss fights—while grinding my teeth at the unpracticality of the wholething. This was hardly conducive to enjoyment, and I can honestly say that Golden Sun’s fighting system was themost tedious part of the game as far as I was concerned. I put up with that unsatisfactoryfighting system because I adored all the rest—the puzzles, the exploration, theenticing atmosphere of the wholegame—but I definitely wish it would have been simpler and more fulfilling, andI can only hope that all things fighting have been bettered and honeyed in theseries’ subsequent entries. Thatbeing said, neither of these flaws is a deal-breaker: there are more akin tominor issues, as I mentioned, and they certainly do not significantly tarnishthe brilliance of Golden Sun. This isa gloriously good game, a true gem that packs some unexpected depth and iscertainly worthy of the title of cult classic. Not only that, but Golden Sun is typically the kind of gamethat gets better with every re-run, just like the Zelda games: the first run may be a trifle tedious because itinvolves a lot of fumbling about and trial-and-error, but once you know how tosolve puzzles, overcome obstacles and collect Djinns, you can enjoy the gamesignificantly more and revel in your ever-growing mastery of it. All in all, Icertainly got more than I bargained for by picking Golden Sun, and I’m delighted by this turn of events. I am firmlyplanning to do a second run in which I will collect all the Djinns and clearthe game for good—in fact, I would have done so already, had Golden Sun been a shorter game; but Ihave to admit that after 25 hours of play, I was really not eager to startagain from scratch. I’ll come back to the game sooner or later, when the moodis right; for now, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "My (most unexpected) Liebster Award", "date": "17/05/2015", "text": "We’llhave something a little bit different this week, dear fellow gamers. A coupleof days ago, I discovered that I had been nominated for the Liebster Award—to myutter surprise, shall I say. The blogger who honouredme with a nomination is YvoCaro at LadiesGamers, a delightful lady in herfifties who makes a point of keeping gaming and is an inspiration for me as faras my gaming future is concerned, and I thank her profusely. This was all themore unexpected as the social side of my blogging is quite poor: apart fromoccasionally commenting on my favourite gaming blogs, I behave like a grumpyold bear, content to post articles when they are written and leave it at that.But since I’ve been nominated, I will rise up to the challenge with gusto!Forthose of you who know as little about the Liebster Award as myself before I wasnominated, it is a tag whose primary purpose is to promote interesting blogs aswell as give bloggers the opportunity to reveal funny anecdotes that theyprobably wouldn’t have mentioned otherwise. It involves answering a set of 11questions issued by the blogger whom nominated you, then revealing 11 fun factsabout yourself, and last but not least issuing your own list of nominees alongwith your own questions for them. Without further ado, let’s go Liebster andstart with IvoCaro’s Eleven!1. Can you tell something typical about thecountry you live in?I livein Europe, these perilous and remote shores that Japanese RPGs hardly ever reached back in the days. I have cried tears of blood over this, but things are fortunately getting better nowadays. A little bit.  2. Why did you take up blogging?I’mquite keen on analyzing and dissecting games, preferably concentrating ondetails that you don’t find in professional reviews, and blogging seemed to bethe perfect terrain to do so. I’m my own editor, which is incrediblyfulfilling! The many excellent gaming blogs I read also gave me a lot of élanand helped me take the plunge, although I was literally terrified when I postedfor the first time. Reserved gamer is reserved! 3. Do you set yourself a goal of number ofblogs per week or month?Therhythm of one post per week came rather naturally after a couple of months.More than that feels too rushed, and less feels not compelling enough. One perweek is perfect!4. Where do you get your inspiration to write?As arule, I need to finish a game before being able to start writing about it inearnest—the only exceptions being long-running games such as roguelikes andsimulations. Then, I mull over the whole experience until I nail down what Icall “the Angle”, i.e. my own structured analysis of the game. “The Angle” isoften fairly subjective, as I tend to pore over some points and gloss overothers; it reflects the mental prism through which I view games and theelements that matter to me as a gamer. So it’s really the meeting between gamesand my gaming subjectivity that sparks posts into life! :D5. Do you own more than one gaming device, andwhich ones?Definitely!I’m a bit of a collector, so I own several copies of some of my devices. As forwhat these devices are, here’s the list:—GameboyAdvance: I own four of them, including a precious backlit model.—NintendoDS Lite/Nintendo DSi: I own one DS lite and five DSi, including an XL model.—Nintendo3ds/Nintendo 2ds: I’m very proud of my “Fire Emblem” Nintendo 3ds XL, and I owna 2ds which is incredibly comfortable to play. I also own a North-American 3ds,and I’m not excluding to buy a couple of extra models in the years to come. —PSP: Iown five models in various colours. —Vita:For now, I only own one. I wouldn’t be against purchasing a Japanese Vita withgorgeous colours, though… 6. What are your favorite kinds of games?I havean undying love for the Holy Realm of RPG, as you may have guessed already. :D I’malso a huge puzzle game aficionado, and I tend to adore games that mix RPGelements with puzzle elements, such as the Zeldaand Golden Sun series or Avalon Code. Dungeon puzzles could be mydaily bread! 7. What are your three favorite movies?That’s abit of a hard one, because I very seldom watch movies… But I would say Groundhog Day, the Shrek saga and Inception:the first two for their obvious comedic appeal, and the last for itsmind-blowing narrative and gorgeous aesthetics. 8. What is your go-to music when you feel sad?There isone track that always puts me in a perky and bouncy mood: Get Lucky by Daft Punk! 9. Does your work or study match your bloggingtopics?Not at all, and that's probably for the best. Although I love gaming dearly, that would be a bit too much of a good thing.  10. If you have a partner, is he or she intogaming?I have apartner… Who’s not one bit into gaming, but very tolerant and occasionallycurious about the whole thing, which is great.11. What kind of pet do you have?I don’thave a pet right now, but I used to take care of an adorable old female cat acouple of years ago. As a whole, I just cannotresist cats. Nowlet’s go for the fun facts! I’m not too keen on revealing private details, soI’ll keep it gaming-centered. That’s what we’re all here for after all,right? :P1. Iread gaming magazines every morning while eating my breakfast, my magazines of choicebeing Retro Gamer, JV and Pix’n Love.2. Iheld a fifteen-year-long grudge against Sony, starting when they took thegaming industry by storm by releasing the Playstation. I deemed themresponsible for having destroyed gaming as I loved it, all flamboyant pixelsand vivid colours, and replaced it with ugly polygons and shitty shades ofbrown. The gap was only bridged a couple of years ago when I purchased a PSP. 3. Allmy gaming systems were destroyed in 2000 when the family’s apartment was flooded.After that, I retreated into emulation and didn’t purchase a gaming system forthe next ten years. 4. Super Mario Land on the Gameboy was thefirst game I purchased with my patiently saved pocket money, back in 1990.However, I would beat it only ten yearslater on emulation. Hard game is hard!5.Talking about Super Mario Land, I babbled about the game to such extent that myfather still remembers the name of the first boss—the accursed King Totomesu—tothis day, a good twenty-five years later. (But hey, I spent days stuck on that boss! I had to ventout my frustration somehow.)6. Sinceportable systems are not popular in my country, I rely heavily on importation tokeep me supplied with games and consoles. I'd say that a good 95% of my games and systems are imported, if not more. 7. Ilike playing games while listening to TV shows, all the more so if the in-gamemusic is mediocre. 8. I’vealways been a portable gamer at heart: first by obligation, since my parentsdidn’t want me to occupy the only TV of the house with my gaming—this wasEurope after all, a part of the world where most people have only one TV set,all the more so in the ’80s and ’90s—then by choice, when I was finally allowed to purchase a SegaMegadrive and realized that I preferred the coziness and intimacy of portablegaming after all. That Megadrive remained the only home console I ever owned.9. Sincethe end of the 16-bit era, I’ve never been tempted by any home console game…That is, until very lately, when I found myself yearning to play Bloodborne after peeking at aplaythrough. I certainly won’t buy a PS4 just to play that lone game,though—especially since I don’t own a TV in the first place. 10. Ifirst though of buying a DS in 2008, but didn’t do it because I was afraid ofnot finding enough games to my liking. Knowing that my DS collection now countshundreds of games, it’s highly ironic in retrospect. For the record, I finally got my first DS in 2011 and it was a gift from my sister.  11. Oneof my favourite gaming systems ever is the Game Gear. Although it was enormous,ate batteries like candies and had a small library of games that wereridiculously easy for the most part, and although I certainly wouldn’t replaymost of these games nowadays, the Game Gear left an unequivocally positiveimpression on me. Game Gear games had a special and unique atmosphere, visuallyas well as aurally, and I adored every single Game Gear game I purchased andplayed, which cannot be said about any of my other gaming systems. (Except forthe Vita, which is doing fine until now; could it become my new Game Gear?Well, I’d certainly like that, thank you very much.)Now isthe time to introduce my nominees! I decided to give the Liebster to bloggerswho didn’t get it lately, which led me to exclude a couple of my favouriteblogs. No offense meant, really; it’s all for the sake of avoiding repetition.Without further ado, here are the happy winners!My RPG BlogThe Sun Rising BlogStay at Home Dad GamerAnd hereare my Eleven for them, dripping with gaming curiosity:1. Canyou tell something typical about the country you live in?2. Whydid you take up blogging?3. Doyou set yourself a goal of number of blogs per week or month?4. Doyou have a favourite gaming system, and if yes, which one and why?5. Whatdo you think of the current console generation?6. Whatare your five favourite gaming genres?7. Whatwas your first gaming system? 8. Doyou see yourself gaming until a ripe old age, or is it something you may giveup after a couple of years?9. Doesyour work or study match your blogging topics?10. Whichwere/are your favourite gaming eras and why?11. Lastbut not least, which gaming system(s) do you currently own?Voilà! That’s all for the show. I’m quite curious toread the answers to these questions, if these honorable bloggers are kindenough to answer them. :D This was an interesting and entertaining experience,and I thank IvoCaro again for giving me the opportunity to stray from by usualwriting path! That was quite refreshing for me, and I hope you enjoyed thislittle incursion into my private gaming life. Thanks for reading, and be myguest anytime!"},
{"title": "Conception II: Deceptive appearances ", "date": "10/05/2015", "text": "Gee, itseems that I’ve been playing nothing but fan-service-laden games lately, doesn’tit? Whether this is purely coincidental or revelatory of a deep-seated trend inmodern gaming—or both—would be an interesting issue to tackle, but I’m notgoing to do so here. Instead, I’m planning to examine the no less interestingissue of the fan-service’s purpose and importance in Conception II—along with other juicy subject matters such as thegameplay, obviously. After having played a handful of fan-servicy games inshort succession, I’m starting to realize that there is, say, fan-service and fan-service. But more on that soon.For now,let’s focus on the usual bit of data. ConceptionII: Children of the Seven Stars, developed by Spike Chunsoft and releasedin 2013(jp) and 2014(na/eu) for the Vita, is the sequel to Conception: Ore no Kodomo o Undekure!, a Japanese-only PSP game. Thetwo games are built on the exact same formula, namely an alternation ofdungeon-crawling segments and dating sim segments, peppered with a solid doseof fan-service for good measure. They also use the exact same gameplaymechanics—so much so that Conception IIcould be seen as a copy-paste of the original Conception with updated graphics and a new cast of charactersrather than a true sequel. Reviewers were mostly unimpressed by this secondeffort, if the scores of 62 on Metacritic and 64.46 on Gamerankings are to bebelieved. Reviews were average for the most part, describing the game as solidyet not especially dazzling, and not really standing apart from the RPG massdespite its risqué undertones and romance sim side. And that is not sosurprising, given the way both fan-service and romance sim mechanics wereimplemented in Conception II and theirreal purpose in the game’s context.  Alluring glaze is just that—a glazeIndeed,although the primary purpose of fan-service in games is always to lure thepotential player’s eye and make them open their purse while salivating inanticipation, nothing forbids said fan-service to serve secondary purposes aswell. As a matter of fact, fan-service doesso in nearly all the games it occupies, and these secondary purposes areusually related to the overall concept of the hosting game. In Code of Princess and Senran Kagura Burst, the fan-service wasa self-derisive addition that gave a parodic overtone to both games; in Criminal Girls, it was woven into thegameplay and molded into a brand-new take on leveling-up mechanics. So, what isexactly the fan-service’s secondary purpose in Conception II? Well,the answer is simple: the fan-service in ConceptionII acts as a glossy, appetizing glaze conveniently applied all over whatturns out to be very classic RPGgameplay mechanics. It is the honey that is bound to attract flies, i.e.potential players, to the fold: why go with the vinegar of arid old-schoolpresentation when you can lure a greater audience with the sticky sweetness ofrisqué looks? Take thegame’s most prominent and eponymous fan-servicy feature: the infamousClassmating, which is none other than the conception of the Star Children whowill accompany you in dungeons. It shows your lady of choice wreathing andundulating, naked and bathed in light, before joining hands with your characterat the end of the act. We could argue that these sequences are hardlytitillating, with their garish colours and mediocre CGIs that make the girlslook like plastic dolls, but that’s not the point. The point is that we do notknow the exact nature of this ritual.Is it plain old-fashioned physical intercourse? Is it a spiritual connection?Is it a mix of both? The Classmating sequences are not exactlyself-explanatory, and neither is the narrative, which bandies vague terms suchas the females’ “Star Energy” and the males’ “Ether Count”—and yes, you’retotally supposed to detect innuendos here, but that doesn’t change the factthat we do not precisely know what Classmatingis. But this uncertainty is entirely normal, because that whole Classmatingbusiness is nothing more than a sexy coating whose sole purpose is to revampwhat is actually a mere character creation interface. Well tried, game, but whodo you think you’re fooling with this transparent trick? The samegoes for every fan-servicy element present in the game. The fact that theladies and your main character don a tighter, skimpier outfit—especially theladies, as you’d expect—when you enter the Labyrinths, treating you to a SailorSenshi-like tranformation? Just a plain attempt at titillation, useless as faras gameplay is concerned and serving no other purpose than to make you lose acouple of precious seconds. The excessive jiggle physics? No comment. The factthat you have seven ladies conceiving and fighting at your side instead of justone? Pure harem-RPG fare, pandering to otakus who want to bite off more thanthey can safely chew. It’s all glitter and shine, designed to make you forgotthat you are actually playing a classic, old-fashioned dungeon crawler—to noavail, as far as I am concerned. That’snot to say that Conception II’s brandof fan-service is horrendous. Superficial it may be, but it does have a coupleof redeeming qualities. For one, it’s not too obtrusive: the risqué parts ofthe Classmating sequences can be skipped, as well as the pre-Labyrinth transformations,and most of the jiggling will pass you by as you read the dialogues. Foranother, it tries to expand its horizons by including elements that can caterto a different audience: the game is rife with homoerotic undertones, from theambiguous relationship between your main character and Alec to the brand-newpossibility of “Classmanting”, i.e. uniting with another male through themultiplayer option in order to create even stronger Star Children, withoutforgetting the “bromance” ending you’ll be treated to if you don’t woo theladies hard enough. Last but not least, ConceptionII’s fan-service is light-hearted and humorous. It’s not hilarious enoughto make the game a genuine parody of romance sims as some claim, but it’scertainly amusing enough to make one grin rather than roll their eyes. Theoccasional silly sexual jokes are quite mild and have a bantering edge thatreminded me of my teenage years, in a good way; I even smiled fondly whenwitnessing that sequence in which the characters wonder if drinking from thesame straw is akin to indirect kissing. Ah, sweet youth.Skin-deep romance is uninvolvingAndsince I’m mentioning kissing, let’s move on to the next juicy matter in line:the romance, folks! L’amour! It isthe logical continuation of the fan-service, but unlike said fan-service, ithas been integrated into the gameplay. Somehow. Let’s face it, this integrationis far from being conclusive, and the romance business appears more often thannot uncomfortably disconnected from the main chunk of the gameplay instead ofbeing tightly woven into it. Not every game series can be Persona, indeed, and here are the main failures of Conception II’s romance sim side:—L’amour is boring. Now, your mileage mayvary on that one, especially if you have a high school fetish; but truth betold, Conception II’s romance is morelikely to induce yawns than flutters in the stomach. The girls are both clichéand cruelly devoid of personality, and that lack is not helped by the fact thatthey all don the same school uniform—bar one. The bland and expressionless CGIsused in the romancing segments do not help either, neither does the fact thatthere are no fixed events like in most romance sims—and let’s not talk aboutthe entirely generic school setting. And talking about school, the game seemsintent on pushing the teenager envelope as far as it can by offering anincredibly tame take on romance, all coy blushes, quid pro quos andhesitations. That’s kind of cute, but it’s hardly thrilling. In fact, it can beseriously disappointing: I spent the wholegame wooing Fuuko only, saying the nicest things to her and showering her withgifts, only to be rewarded by monologues such as: “Don’t get all worked out, hedoesn’t mean it, there’s no way he loves a girl as plain as me.” Well, excuseme, but I’m trying my hardest to convey my love here, and I would have liked tosee my efforts rewarded in a more fulfilling and conclusive way.  —L’amour is incoherent. This is an evenworse flaw than the one above, because it disrupts the natural flow of theromance and prevents you from immersing yourself completely in it. To put itsimply, there are two types of romantic scenes: the Key Scenes, which aremilestones showing the (meagre) progress of your relationship, and the FillerScenes, which are here to fill in the blanks between Key Scenes. The FillerScenes show some generic babbling that is entirely noncommittal as far asromance is concerned, and that’s where the problem lies: such scenes break theimmersion by not taking into account the romantic developments between you andthe involved girl up until that point. Worse, they can sometimes blatantlycontradict said romantic developments. During my run, I witnessed a Key Scenein which Fuuko declared her love for me, after which I was served a FillerScene in which we chit-chatted and she tried to convince herself that we werejust classmates and that there was nothing between us—scene that I had alreadywitnessed several times since the beginning of the game. I don’t know about you,but I find rather hard to be swept away by such a disjointed love story. Thegame also occasionally forces on you scripted scenes in which one of the girlsmourns the fact that you’ve not been roaming the dungeons with her lately andbegs you to take her along next time you go crawling. I played the whole game with Fuuko only, and yet Igot not one, but two such scenes withher. And I am supposed to believe that there is a strong bond between us andthat we are actually in love? Well, excuse me, but I find a teeny-weeny bithard to do so.   —L’amour is utilitarian. Wooing the girlsis the most efficient way to gain some so-called Bond Points, which then can bespent to perform the Classmating ritual or to perform special attacks. Whilethis may seem like a neat way to tie the romance to the gameplay, it actuallycheapens said romance by turning it into a mere trick to cash in currency.Added to the tedium and incoherency of l’amour,it can lead to a situation in which you find yourself triggering andfast-forwarding romantic scenes solely to get the Bond Points you need, whichis anything but fulfilling. Romancing in RPGs is always better as an extraoption independent from the main gameplay, a yummy side dish that acts as alovely breather from all the crawling and butchering and that you can savourwhen you’re in the mood for it, not when you need some currency.  All inall, I was most unimpressed by ConceptionII’s take on l’amour. Of course,I understand the logic behind some of the design decisions regardingromancing: relationships must stay mostly noncommittal because of the schoolsetting, romance scenes have to be partly disconnected from one another inorder to allow the wooing of several girls at once without any jealousyinvolved, as well as disconnected from the dungeon crawling in order to betriggered at any point in the game; this all makes perfect sense, but itdoesn’t make for a pleasurable gameplay experience. The romance ultimatelyfeels like an unnecessary addition that cannot hold a candle to the core of Conception II’s gameplay—which is noneother than pure, unadulterated dungeon crawling. Dungeon crawling is strong with this oneIndeed,forget the glossy fan-service and l’amour;behind these shiny looks, Conception IIis a dungeon crawler through and through. That’s exactly what I expected fromthe start, so I was delighted—all the more so as the crawling experienceoffered by the game is a highly solid and enjoyable one. Conception II may not be the best conceived and most addictivedungeon crawler ever, but it certainly holds its ground thanks to an enticingcombination of old-school substance and modern form.  Indeed,the substance of Conception II’sbrand of dungeon crawling is as classical as it gets. This is old-fashionedroaming at its best, with a completely assumed aridity that should delight anydungeon crawler aficionado who thinks that less is more. The design is clear-cutand no-frills—to a fault, may say some—and identical for every dungeon: squarerooms bristling with monsters connected by corridors devoid of any, one wardthat lets you escape the dungeon and another that lets you move on to the nextfloor, all generously sprinkled with tons of safes to loot and occasionaltraps. And nothing else: no secret passageways, no hidden bosses, no MonsterRooms—although all rooms could be considered as such, in a way. The aridity ofthe whole thing is further reinforced by the fact that the dungeons arerandomly generated: this is a pure and astringent crawling experience thatserves you a brand-new challenge with every single floor and never lets you relyon the comforting knowledge of the dungeons’ layouts to ease your way through.Pleasure is derived not from beating the dungeons per se, since they are ever-changing structures, but rather fromthe slightly compulsive urge to scour every single floor and leave no stoneunturned, no safe unopened and, for the most hardcore of us, no foe alive. Thecrawling becomes significantly less fulfilling when one tries to make a beelinefor the exit, because Conception II’sdungeon design is made to accommodate both thorough exploration and assiduousfighting. It is bare-bones, it is repetitive, and it is deliberately andunapologetically so—classic dungeon crawling for the most dedicated aficionadosof the genre. The formof Conception II’s brand of dungeoncrawling, on the other hand, is unashamedly modern. Spike Chunsoft knew betterthan to stick to the clunky aspects of old-fashioned dungeon crawling, and theytried their hardest to give their game a good dose of sleek modern gaming chic—to great success. It starts with thegame’s gorgeous aesthetics: aridly designed dungeons do not have to be incompatiblewith eye-candy, after all, and we are thus treated to a unique brand ofstylization that could best be described as “Baroque abstract”. It involvesgeometrical patterns and ingenious combinations of vivid colours—onecombination per dungeon, from the most harmonious to the most garish—as well ascelestial or aquatic backgrounds that can be glimpsed at when you position thecamera properly. Talking about this, the camera can be rotated around thecharacters at well as tilted in three different positions; not only does thisflexibility allow you to discover dungeons from a new angle—literally—but it isalso incredibly useful to spot monsters and safes. Said safes are pleasantlynumerous, yet not overwhelmingly so; the balance in that regard is perfect, andthis cleverly dosed amount of safes provide a great incentive to exploredungeons to the fullest. Conception IIalso boasts a good dose of user-friendliness when it comes to escaping andentering the dungeons. Every floor has an escape ward, conveniently localizedin the very room where you start the roaming. This is already neat enough, butthere is better: the game lets you re-enter dungeons from any floor that hasbeen previously cleared, meaning that you can basically start over from whereyou left off. Add to this the fact that you are automatically healed every timeyou exit dungeons and you have the catering cherry on top of the conveniencecake. As a result, every progress becomes meaningful and every cleared floor iscleared for good, creating a deeply fulfilling dungeon crawling experience thatalso happens to be perfectly tailored to the brand of portable gaming offeredby the Vita. There are tons of other useful features designed to make thingseasier, but enumerating them all would be tedious; suffice it to say that Conception II is a game that takesuser-friendliness to heart. Conception II is thus thoroughly dissected and laid bareunder your eyes, and you know what to expect now: a pure dungeon crawler withskin-deep risqué looks and unconvincing romancing mechanics. From what I’veunderstood, the first instalment fared a tad better as a dating sim: it hadtwelve ladies instead of seven as well as seasonal events, which are completelyabsent from Conception II. CouldSpike Chunsoft have decided to let l’amourtake a step back in Conception IIfavour of pure, unadulterated dungeon crawling? Since I didn’t play the firstgame, I cannot say for sure; but if you know, you’re more than welcome to fillme in. What I can say for sure, however, is that I truly loved Conception II. I didn’t care that muchfor the romance in the first place and was mostly looking for a good, meatydungeon crawler; that is exactly what I got, so I’m delighted. More than that,I’m starting to dig the Vita’s brand of dungeon crawling, and I’m more thanready to lap up all the Vita dungeon crawlers that come my way—which is quiteneat, given that there are tons of them, most being already part of my preciouscollection. My Vita prospects look bright indeed, as well as my dungeoncrawling ones! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Criminal Girls: The guiltiest pleasure of them all", "date": "03/05/2015", "text": "Ah, the CriminalGirls controversy. This game ignited the latest massive moral debate in thegaming landscape— a debate not as virulent as the one surrounding Mortal Combat’s gory Fatalities back inthe days, granted, but still prominent enough to generate heaps of internetranting, both in the game’s favour and against it. In the end, and ironicallyenough, no one seems to be satisfied with CriminalGirls: some slander it for being too kinky, some for being too soft andheavily censored, and others for simply existing.What is that game that generates such intensecontroversy and seemingly fails to cater genuinely to any audience? With itstitle vaguely reminiscent of the ’70s Women-in-Prison flicks, Criminal Girls: Invite Only positions itself as a fully maturegame aimed at the adult audience that supposedly favours the Vita. This 2014Vita remake/port ramps up the fan-service considerably when compared to theoriginal Japanese-only PSP instalment; however, everything else was leftuntouched, from graphics to gameplay mechanics. Upon coming to the West, thegame was famously censored, to the utter dismay of some gamers who wanted thewhole package, moans and crotch shots and all; this added another layer to thealready existing controversy, with a portion of the targeted audience now beingunhappy with the final product. Some went as far as importing the original gamefrom Japan, which must have delighted Nippon Ichi Software as well asImageepoch.Where do I stand in all this, you may ask?Well, I’ll be blunt: I absolutely adored CriminalGirls. In fact, it’s fair to say that I was literally glued to my Vitaduring the course of my Criminal Girlsrun: I would play for hours on end, entranced by the intoxicating gameplay, anddidn’t touch any other game in the meantime—heck, I didn’t even think of any other game in the meantime,so deep was I stuck in that Criminal Girls trance. And yet, when all was saidand done, I felt some strange reluctance to write about that game that I hadloved so much. I was wondering how to talk properly about Criminal Girls, or even whether I should talk about it at all. The game has been so thoroughlydissected due to the controversy surrounding it that one feels there is nothingmore to say about it: from the fighting system to the scandalous mini-games,everything has been mulled over adnauseam, and the prospect of repeating the process here didn’t thrill me inthe slightest. After a bit of pondering, I decided to concentrate on the game’soverall concept, deliberately glossing over the technicalities of the gameplay.Gameplay in a nutshellI’ll still dedicate a paragraph to the matter,though—just in case someone who never encountered any other review of Criminal Girls is reading that post andwants to figure out what you actually doin that game. (Highly unlikely, but you never know.) I’ll keep it short anddry: Criminal Girls is a pure dungeoncrawler with turn-based random battles. The encounter rate is decent, you canflee from battles and encounters can be avoided entirely. The characters levelup quite fast and regularly from beginning to end. New abilities must belearned by successfully completing touch-screen based mini-games involvingrubbing and poking the Vita’s front and rear screens. These mini-games areobviously the infamous kinky bits involving risqué shots of the characters, andyou cannot skip them if you want tobe able to progress: the bosses are tough cookies and you cannot hope to beatthem without mastering the abilities granted by the mini-games. “Mastering” maynot be the exact word, since you cannot freely choose the move you want to usewhile fighting: instead, you have to select one of the four moves suggested byyour party—one suggested move per character. This introduces a welcome dose ofstrategy in all things fighting, as well as an uncertainty than can bethrilling; and since the A.I. is usually spot-on, there is virtually no risk oflosing a battle due to bad suggestions. Resting is free, you can save anytime andanywhere and there is a good range of useful items and field skills designed tomake your roam easier: as a whole, CriminalGirls is very user-friendly. There is a modicum of narrative, woven intothe dungeon-crawling in a clever and seamless way—which is rare enough to bepraised—as well as a couple of sidequests with benefits. And that, ladies andgentlemen, is the gist of Criminal Girls’sgameplay for you. Unexpected tiesNow that I’m done with the gameplay exposition,I can focus on a deeper, juicier analysis of Criminal Girls’s premise: in other words, the pervasive andin-your-face fan-service, which was by and large Criminal Girls’ biggest selling argument. Unlike the campyfan-service present in Senran Kagura Burst, which was merely an addition to the game’s rock-solid mechanics, thefan-service in Criminal Girls istightly woven into the gameplay and thus pretty much unescapable. It impactsthe storyline as well as the gameplay mechanics in a way that I found veryreminiscent to a much more famous gaming series. More than reminiscent, infact: the similarities are seriously uncanny, and so blatant that they may have been at least partly intentional. For, lo and behold, Criminal Girls is basically a risqué, human-based take on the Pokemon gameplay mechanics, and couldeasily bear the subtitle “Pokemon: Pervy Version”. Here’s how the strikingresemblance unfolds:—The two games feature the same core principleof forcing weaker creatures to do your bidding through the use of brute force.In Pokemon, you beat down wildanimals a hair’s breadth away from death in order to be able to capture themwithout resistance; in CG, you whipyoung women into submission. The infamy of your actions is somewhat concealedbehind weak justifications such as “Pokemons get hurt fighting in the wild, soit’s actually better for them to be under the protection of a Trainer” or“These girls are have committed minor crimes and are on their way to commitbigger ones, so they must be put back on the right track by any means necessaryfor their own good”, but these pretenses don’t survive a sharp examination.Sugar-coat it all you want, but the bottom line is that you’re acting like abig coward bully by forcing your will on free, independent beings that wereasking nothing more than to live their life and follow their own wayunhindered. —Once you forcefully enrolled these freebeings, they are expected to fight on your behalf, standing in the front linewhile you shout orders in the back. Of course, they also fight on their ownbehalf in order to avoid being killed; but the point is that the character youincarnate is not physically involved in the fighting, preferring instead tooversee the operations from the safety of the rear. As a result, Pokemon and CG focus primarily not on the Trainer/Warden that you incarnate,but rather on the charges that are in your care, who then reap the biggest partof the fighting glory—which is only fair. Of course, your main character—andthus you— is also regularly hailed asa great leader who managed to steer the course of action in the desireddirection—the proverbial iron hand in a velvet glove. —In Pokemonas well as CG, your charges seem toaccept their destiny as semi-slaves quite quickly and without too much resistance.Sure, they are wary and sulky at first, and follow you somewhat grudgingly: ananalysis of your newly enrolled ’Mons’ gaits will reveal that they don’t feeltoo warmly about you, and the CG delinquents will regularly snap at you andrebuff your attempts at kindness. However, said ’Mons don’t go straight foryour throat as soon as they are out of their Pokeballs, and said delinquentsdon’t try to give you the slip or to sting a knife between your ribs whenyou’re asleep like any real wildanimal or delinquent would do in such circumstances, so they can definitely beconsidered compliant. This unexpected meekness can alleviate your own guiltover enslaving your charges, should you have any: since they keep following youeven after it becomes clear that they could take you down in two hits, togetheror separately, then they must somehow be happy with the whole situation andconsent to it. —In the wake of this begrudging acceptance oftheir uncomfortable situation, your charges develop a serious case of Stockholmsyndrome by becoming exponentially attached to you. The more time they spendwith you fighting on your behalf, the more affectionate they become. You willsuddenly discover that the analysis of your ’Mons’ gaits reveal a deep fondnessfor you and a complete trust; as for CG’sdelinquents, they will start singing your praises in earnest, and theirgrimaces of pain and insults during and after the punishment sessions will bereplaced by dreamy smiles and thanks.—The feeling is mutual, since you also develop a sincere fondness foryour charges in the meantime. You may consider them from a purely utilitarianpoint of view at first, but that will change as playing hours go buy and allowyou discover them and witness their interesting evolution—in every sense of theword. (Interestingly, CG’sdelinquents can go through a transformation that is very similar to Pokemon’s Evolution, granting them a newappearance as well as more powerful moves. Even the transformation scene itselfis strikingly similar to the Evolution scenes in Pokemon.) Before you know it, you will find yourself lovinglycooking puffins for your ’Mons and showering them with accessories, or diligentlyrunning all around the place to find some lost items that the delinquents careabout and pouring all your energy into helping them overcome their hurdles. Theevolution of CG’s punishmentsessions, or “Motivation Time” as they were renamed in the Western version, alsoshows plainly this change of heart: the punishments get lighter and lighter,until you finally tickle the girls lightly with a feather duster and massagethem gently with a soft cushion. Well, that’s certainly a major improvement fromwhipping or electrocution. In a highly ironic turnaround, you finally findyourself in a position where youserve your charges instead of the other way around: you may be the one bossingthem around, but the whole game is about them,and they are at the heart of theaction. This aspect is even more pronounced in CG, which completely glosses over your main character: the wholegame is about the delinquents’ life and struggles, and your character is only presentedas a helper assisting them on their path to redemption. —To crown this evolution, the two games serveyou a positive finale in which everyone’s warm feelings towards one another arecemented and presented as the basis for fruitful and enduring relationships. Pokemon games treat you to the grandElite Four victory, in which your Trainer and ’Mons are presented as a seamlessunit and collectively hailed; if you didn’t already feel the deepest devotiontowards your  ’Mons by that time, thisscene will certainly tip the scales. As for CG,it veers towards a romance sim right before the end, and keeps steering in thatdirection during the whole postgame segment. As a result, the pre-postgame endtreats you to a romantic ending with one of the girls, while the postgame partallows you to woo the other delinquents and delivers a “harem ending” in whichall the girls are seemingly smitten with you and make plans to keep you intheir lives, hopefully forever. As a whole, your interaction with your chargesis presented as an unabashedly positive experience that only brought favorablechanges: your charges became stronger and wiser, you became kinder and gentler,and everybody reaped some love and fulfilling relationships in the process. Whether or not you’ll be able to appreciate oreven tolerate Criminal Girls reallydepends on how readily you can take in that whole Stockholm syndrome-friendlydevelopment. Compared to this chain of events, the actual content of the risquémini-games is a moot point: there is really nothing more to it than randomlyrubbing your fingers over a collection of suggestive images ten times tamerthan anything you can find in a hentai anime—not to mention that you’ll be toobusy keeping track of the areas to rub to ogle at these pictures in earnest. Tosee the girls repay your bad treatments with love and promiscuity is much moredisturbing, and swallowing the whole concept requires a good dose of suspensionof disbelief—and dignity.Flailing aboutAlthough I totally adored that game, I won’tdeny that I also felt a modicum of discomfort at times, and the malaise onlyincreased as the game went on. This uneasiness can be blamed on one mainfactor, and that factor is the striking lack of focus and direction of thewhole fan-service package. Unlike the brand of fan-service at work in Senran Kagura Burst’s or Code of Princess, which was blatantlyself-derisive and campy, the fan-service featured in Criminal Girls doesn’t know if it wants to be parodic, titillatingor romantic, and ends up mixing all three moods together in hopes of getting anenticing result. Unfortunately, it is not happening, and the result comesacross as an incoherent clutter sending uncomfortably mixed messages. Take the infamous rubbing mini-games, forinstance: despite being at the center of the controversy surrounding Criminal Girls, they clearly lean on theparodic side. The tone is set from the beginning, when it turns out that thereason why the delinquents don’t wear their prisoner garb during these segmentsis because your character asks them to wear cosplay outfits before starting. Iswear that I laughed out loud when I discovered that ridiculous justification,and that was only the first of many laughing and cackling fits generated by themini-games. The subsequent poses of the girls and the fact that their outfitsseem to crawl mysteriously back on their bodies, conveniently revealingincreasing amounts of flesh, are so over-the-top that they definitely comeacross as more hilarious than salacious. I could nearly picture myselfsurveying the operations and issuing ridiculous orders to get these results:“Okay, now take that pose… Good…And now, lift up your top a little more… Voila!” Add to this the wonky themetrack and the exaggerated moans, insults and comments emitted by the girls inthe original Japanese version, and you get a package that looks and feels likean assumed parody of your average otaku’s hentai fantasies. On the other hand, the fact that thedelinquents wear short and revealing prison garb by default, completed bysexually laden accessories such as dog collars and high socks, is obviously designedto arouse the player. So is probably the round sofa on which they lounge whilein the “Infirmary”, which seems to come straight out of a porn flick and makesthe place looks more like a brothel than like the infirmary it is supposed tobe. Things get even more lascivious toward the end, as the girls go through theKnight transformation and shed their prison garb to don outfits that areconsiderably more risqué. This is a very straightforward and transparent attemptat titillation that doesn’t pack the slightest bit of self-derision: thepurpose is clearly to shove as much eye-candy as possible into the game inorder to satisfy the player’s ogling urges. It could also explain Criminal Girls’ refusal to follow thecurrent hot trend in its own niche, namely the addition of a male touch intothe fan-servicy mix. Senran Kagura 2 comprises a male character who can be stripped just as easily as itsfemale counterparts, Akiba’s Trip integrateas many males opponents as females, and Conception II is rife with bromance and yaoiinnuendos; yet Criminal Girls didn’tdare to follow that trend, maybe for fear of alienating its intended audienceand spoiling its own candid attempt at titillation. Last but not least is the romantic side of Criminal Girls, which comes into play latein the game. After they go through the Knight transformation, the delinquentsare bound to start experiencing feelings of love toward your main character andexpressing them in unambiguous fashion. This new direction involve cheesysentences along the lines of “I want to make you happy” and “Please let me stayby your side forever”, as well as an ultimate mini-game that looks like somekind of foreplay and insinuates in hardly veiled terms that you and theinvolved delinquent will have sex afterwards. When you beat the final boss, youget a romantic happy ending with the delinquent of your choice, all frolickingaround and swearing eternal love to each other; then, the postgame lets you woothe rest of the crew before treating you to the ultimate “Harem Ending”, inwhich the girls chat together about their feelings for you and decide to taketurns on dating you, giggling about the fact that you’ll certainly be vigorousenough to satisfy them all despite your ripe old age. This sequence is a littlebit sickening: although it’s fun to see the tables being turned and the girlstalking about using your character like some kind of sexual prop for their owngratification, it’s hard not to feel grossed out by the cynicism of the wholething. I do admit that this particular scene and the romantic direction as awhole screamed “Stockholm syndrome” a littletoo loud for my comfort. Needless to say, these three highly differenttones clash vigorously with each other. The romantic orientation comescompletely out of the blue and feels like it has been hammered into the game,either to cater to the mawkish love fantasies of your regular otaku or tosoften the impact of the game’s softcore sadistic undertones—maybe both. Thein-your-face attempt at titillation comes across as bland and run-of-the mill,the kind of tired fan-service seen a million times before in a million games,and the parodic charge of the mini-games is defused by both the unsubtleeye-candy and the late romantic twist. I really wish Criminal Girls had picked a single mood and stuck to it all the way;this would certainly have made the whole experience easier to digest and lessnauseating. My design of choice would have been to tone down the eye-candy andrestrict skin exposure to the mini-games, thus making them more rewarding, andto drop the saccharine romantic outcome entirely in favour of a grittier endingin which everybody admits that their time together is done and proceeds tofollow their own path without turning back. No syrupy crap such as going toschool together and living happily ever after as a harem, but rather somethinglike “We had some unpleasant moments together, some much more pleasant, and weall learnt and grew from the experience; but it was just a phase, and it’sover. Adieu, you pervy warden, andmay we never meet again!” Proceed then to show the utter dismay of the abandonedmain character, who sincerely believed that women would fall in love with himeven if he treated them like crap just like in all harem animes, and you’d havehad the cherry on top of the parodic cake. Or, had Imageepoch had the guts tofollow the “male touch” hot trend of the moment, they could have included sequencesin which your main character had to endure the punishment sessions at the hands of the girls—what goesaround comes around, karma’s a b*tch and all that, you know. That would havebeen hilarious, and I would definitely have loved to see—and play—that kind oftwist. Still, there’s no denying that I loved Criminal Girls through and through,despite its uneven tone and Stockholm syndrome-laden intrigue. It is abrilliant dungeon crawler with gorgeous aesthetics that offers a deeplyfulfilling roaming experience, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyaficionado of the genre who feels they can stomach the game’s peculiar brand offan-service. As for me, I will most certainly play it again sooner or later,although I may abstain from clearing the sickly postgame segment during my nextrun. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Shining Soul: Greatness averted", "date": "26/04/2015", "text": "Untilnot so long ago, one of my biggest gaming regrets was to have missed out on theGameboy Advance era entirely. This glaring omission in my gaming career can beblamed both on the fact that the system was poorly advertised in Europe andsold mostly as a kiddie console and on the fact that I was pouring all mygaming hours into emulation at that time, revisiting 16-bit era classics with afervour matched only by my lack of interest in new gaming consoles. When Ifinally became aware of the GBA’s existence, the system was not producedanymore and the DS was soaring, so I chose to focus on the latter. However, Icould never get rid of the saddening thought that I had let potentially greatgames pass me by while I was soaked into replaying games that I already knewlike the back of my hand; and a couple of years later, aided by internet, Idecided to revisit history and mend my oversight by purchasing a GBA, alongwith all the games that could possibly interest me. This move certainly helpedme get rid of my regret of not having played the system in its heyday—albeitnot always in the expected way, as we’ll see in this post. Indeed,we are now tackling one of these GBA games that passed me by in its time. Shining Soul, developed by GrasshopperManufacture and released in 2002(jp) and 2003(na/eu), is part of thelong-running Shining series. Createdby Sega in 1991, the Shining seriesencompasses a variety of games borrowing liberally from different RPG subgenres,from first-person dungeon crawler to S-RPG. ShiningSoul was actually supposed to be a reboot of the series; and while it maywell be so on the narrative side, since ShiningSoul introduces a new story arc, it is much harder to believe that thisgame had such grand ambitions as far as gameplay is concerned. Or it may have had such grand ambitions, butthey failed to materialize properly. ShiningSoul’s gameplay is average at best, patchy at worst, and as a wholeshockingly rudimentary for a game that presented itself as a new departure. Theworst part is that this gameplay, and the game as a whole, could have been much better with the right amount of care and gusto.There was some potential in Shining Soul,that much is undeniable; unfortunately, it was not exploited to the fullest, aswe’ll see right now.  Presentation at its barestIndeed, Shining Soul is so dry and unpolishedthat it is quite hard to believe it was developed for the GBA. Graphics aside,it could definitely have passed for a NES game, and it is in many ways inferiorto handheld games that are a good ten years older, such as Link’s Awakening or Final Fantasy Legend II. Either the developers didn’t know how to handle the GBAor they didn’t care about crafting a respectable game, for Shining Soul doesn’t shine in the slightest indeed.Thefirst example of dullness lies in the narrative, which is as bare andunexciting as it can be. A couple of lines in an exposition sequence, followedby a short dialogue with a bunch of unknown characters who order you to goslaughter the Dark Dragon and its five generals, and off to the dungeons yougo! Add to this meagre introduction a couple of unclear lines spurt out by thebosses before they fight you, and you’ll have the whole narrative content of Shining Soul. Now, I repeated oftenenough that I prefer my RPG narrative to be on the light side, and Shining Soul makes no mystery of being apure dungeon crawler, which automatically gives it a pass to dispense with aconvoluted storyline; so this bare-bones story shouldn’t be an issue, right?Well, it would not be an issue, ifnot for two blatant flaws:—The narrativedoesn’t make the slightest attempt to create a connection between you and thegame world: you don’t know how the people you interact with are, you don’t knowif the village in which you rest is your home village or just some randomplace, and you don’t even know the name of the game world. The NPCs haveabsolutely nothing to say and actually don’t seem to know you—heck, even you do notknow who you are supposed to be, for that matter. This is simply the mostalienating and disconnected narrative I’ve everseen in an RPG, and I am still baffled by the emptiness and vapidity of thewhole thing. Even FFI was way betterthan this: at least, it had several villages, a roamable world map and morethan five NPCs, all things painfully absent from Shining Soul. —Thevery few dialogues present in the game give off the persistent feeling that Shining Soul is actually the sequel to something, with everybodytalking like they know you from before and referring to past events like theyare common knowledge. Given that the game is supposed to be a reboot, this is avery embarrassing failure. And since I am mentioning this, shouldn’t a rebootstrive a little more to offer a decent new narrative departure to its series inthe first place? That makes this narrative fiasco a double failure that is allbut impossible to ignore. Heck, I am as lenient as a gamer can be when it comesto mediocre storytelling, but this is simply unacceptable, no matter how youlook at it.  Thecoarseness of Shining Soul doesn’tstop here, unfortunately, with the game’s visuals being just as crude as itsstoryline. Their overall quality is decent enough, mind you, and on par withmost early GBA games; unfortunately, these satisfactory graphics are sapped byan atrocious lack of coherence. For one thing, the visualization is uneven,with the viewing angle changing between levels: some dungeons sport a top-downview while others sport an isometric view. This is quite bizarre, and goesagainst that implicit level design rule stipulating that similar gameplayphases should stick to the same type of visualization. But there is worse:scales also vary dramatically from one level to the next. Egual Dungeon issupposed to be a volcanic mountainous chain, yet features volcanos that arehardly higher than your sprite; on the other hand, Deol Waterway features docksand levees that dwarf your character and could easily accommodate hundreds ofsprites. The result is jarring and utterly messy, and one could seriouslywonder why such a design was adopted—or even if it was the result of a wellthought-out decision. One could seriously doubt it: these dungeons clash sovividly with one another that they look like they’ve been handled by entirelydifferent teams—and maybe that was actually the case, for all we know.To dullthe game even more, the equipment, inventory and forging management isabsolutely pitiful. It is tedious, highly unpractical and completelyunrewarding, and it is doubtful whether the developers even tried to make it good, let alone put any effort into designing the wholething. Once again, I am usually very forgiving when it comes to poor inventoryergonomy and the like, especially with older games; but Shining Soul’s resource management system has no redeeming qualitywhatsoever, no matter how kindly you examine it. Here are my three main gripeswith said system, the ones that had me rolling my eyes and grinding my teethmore than once:—Thereare four classes to choose when you start a run, and each class can equip threeexclusive weapons that cannot be used by other classes. However, once you startroaming the dungeons, you are bound to find all the weapons available in thegame, regardless of whether or not you can actually equip them. This will leadto either having your inventory completely cluttered in a matter of minutes orbeing forced to leave a good chunk of the safes’ content and monster dropsbehind, which is anything but fulfilling. I wish the developers had programmedthe game so that any item not usable by your chosen character would have beenwiped off from the ensuing run, at least in the single player mode. —Thismishap actually also ruins the already pitiful forging system present in Shining Soul, making it all but useless.Here’s the gist of it: if you bring three fragments of any ore to some guylounging in the village’s green, he will forge a powerful weapon for you. Good,right? Wrong. The problem is, youcannot choose what kind of weapon you want him to forge, which means that you onlyhave a one-in-four chance to get a weapon usable by your character; and if youhappen to have a favourite type of weapon out of the three available, then it’sonly a one-in-twelve chance to get that precise type. This is more than justunpractical; this is downright idiotic, especially considering how rare oresare. I only found three in the course of my whole run, and—you guessed it—thatamateur blacksmith crafted a weapon that I couldn’t use. Talk about a completelyuseless, pathetic excuse for a forging system. —Lastbut not least is the miserable selection of equipment available in thevillage’s two shops. They hardly update their selection throughout the wholegame, and it’s not exaggerated to say that you can find much better equipmentlying around in dungeons. As a matter of fact, I did not buy a single piece of equipment from thesepathetic traders during the course of my run because what they offered wasinferior to my latest monster drops. As you’d expect, this makes any money youmanage to collect virtually useless, which is just disheartening. The deal-breakerAllthese flaws I just mentioned are quite annoying, but Shining Soul still had a chance to redeem itself by treating us toa stellar fighting system. Bad presentation would have been all but forgottenif this game, which was branded from the get-go as an Action-RPG, had offeredus some polished and intoxicating hacking-and-slashing. How hard could that be?Well, a lot more than you’d think, if ShiningSoul’s actual wretched excuse for a fighting system is to be believed. It couldhave been the game’s saving grace, but it turns out to be the stone sinking itto the bottom instead. This foul fighting system has two horrendous flaws thatruin absolutely all the fun, exposedhere in all their calamitous glory: —TheMissed Hits of Doom: All the time. With nearly all weapons. Sometimes affectinghalf of your hits, sometimes even more. Present from the first second of thegame to the last, no matter how much you level up your dexterity stat. And tramplingon your fun, ripping it apart. Seriously, I nearly ragequit a couple of timesbecause it pissed me off to see half of my blows go down the drain. To addinsult to injury, the sound effect for missed hits is a horrendous hollowwooden clunk; hearing it repeatedly was like pouring oil on fire, so much sothat I actually played the whole game with the sound off. I abhor missed hits in A-RPGs, and thisgame is afflicted with the worst case of it I’ve ever seen. Compared to Shining Soul’s fighting system, Sword of Mana’s one is a pure gem. —TheSlowness of Abomination: I don’t know about you, but I expect a modicum ofswiftness in my A-RPGs; some nervous, adrenaline-laden action that willcontrast pleasantly with the slower fighting typical of Turn-based RPGs. And,well, I certainly did not get it in ShiningSoul. It’s already bad enough that your character moves sluggishly,crawling around rather than running, but they also hit sluggishly, no matter how frantically you hammer the A-button.You may think this is due to hardware limitations, but it is not: occasionalpower-ups will let you deliver blows faster for a short period of time, as wellas certain weapons, and the GBA has no problem handling these phases. Indeed,this is very much a design choice, and one that further ruins Shining Soul’s already miserablefighting system. Comparedto this terrible duo, the other flaws of the fighting system become hardlynoticeable. Really, who cares about the fact that foes have no densitywhatsoever and that you can walk through them as though they were made of thinair, or about the fact that the hit box can be a bit wobbly, when moving aroundand delivering blows are such massive chores to begin with? Shining Soul’s physics are loathsomethrough and through, and there is not the slightest shred of enjoyment to bewringed out of this hot mess of a fighting system. Had I not found a slightlyfaster sword that let me hit faster in the fourth dungeon, I would probablyhave given up on my run before the end, despite my undying love for A-RPGs. EpilogueIndeed,and surprisingly enough given the scathing harangue I just wrote, I did finish the game. There are tworeasons for that: the first is that I’m always reluctant to give up on a gamethat I physically imported, with shipping and toll fees involved—I want torecoup my investment somehow, especially when the involved game is an RPG. Thesecond and most important reason is that I could actually see glimpses ofgoodness in the middle of all the mediocrity, glimpses that hinted at a vastpotential that was sadly left unexploited. Take thelast four dungeons, for instance: they are truly gorgeous, with their isometricview and high level of details, and more pleasantly intricate than the firstfour ones. They could, and should,have been the template for all the dungeons in the game. Likewise, the fightingsystem was genuinely enjoyable the rare times I managed to get that speedpower-up, and took a turn for the better after I found that faster sword at thehalfway mark. Once again, the pleasant speed displayed at those times shouldnot have been something exceptional, but rather the default speed of thefighting system. The truth is that ShiningSoul could have been a great game:none of its flaws were due to technical limitations, and every single one ofthem could have been overcome with the right amount of care, dedication andhard work. Make the available weapons fit the chosen character. Put more itemsin the shops. Introduce a modicum of backstory. Choose a top-down or isometricview and a scale, and stick to them. Ramp up the walking speed, the hittingspeed, and wipe these cursed missed hits from the face of that GBA cartridge.And so on. Indeed, Shining Soul couldhave been subtitled “Missed Opportunity”: for a game that was supposed to be areboot, this stings hard. What apity, and what a shame. Still, Iam actually glad to have played that game, not matter how disappointing itturned out to be. In fact, I am glad precisely because it was disappointing, in a twisted sort of way. This bringsus back to the beginning of that post and to my persistent regret of havingmissed the GBA era. Between the moment I discovered the GBA’s existence and themoment I purchased one, I somehow glorified the system and its game library,elevating the latter to nearly mythical proportions. I pictured cult classicsdonning the gorgeous bright colours so typical of the GBA era and the retropixelated art I’m so fond of, games that would nearly shine brighter than theirDS counterparts. Absence makes the heart grows fonder, indeed, and the grass isalways greener on the other side of the fence. However, after having played Shining Soul, I suddenly realized that theGBA pastures are not nearly as fertile and greener-than-green as I hadimagined. In my mind, the system was near-perfect and could do no wrong, andthe idea that I missed such perfection pained me and ultimately prompted topurchase a GBA; but I see now that there was really not that much to miss inthe first place. The GBA is not a monument of gaming perfection, but rather amere console similar to any other console under the gaming sun, with strengthsand weaknesses and a library containing both sparkling gems and stinky turds.Ironically, I have yet to uncover and play a true GBA cult classic; Sword of Mana certainly didn’t qualifyfor that accolade, and Shining Souleven less. Riviera could pass withflying colours, but I played it on the PSP, so I have a hard time consideringit a GBA game… That being said, I’m not done with my GBA collection, and I’msure that I will unearth some gems sooner or later—maybe starting with Shining Soul’s sequel, which is deemedmuch better than its elder and which I’m definitely planning to play. Untilthen, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Tales of Hearts R: Good game gone stale", "date": "19/04/2015", "text": "I have abudding yet already very complicated relationship with the Tales series. My first foray into the long-running Namco franchise wasTales of the Abyss on the 3ds, a gamethat aggravated and delighted me in equal parts: when I finished it, I was bothelated and vomiting the whole thing, and the ambivalence persists to this day.My second Tales game was Tales of Phantasia, the originalinstalment: it failed to capture my interest and I dropped it after a couple ofhours—although I’d wager that this was mostly due to the fact that I wasplaying Final Fantasy Legend II atthe same time and thus had more than my fill of retro RPG. (I’ll play it again,I swear, if only to recoup my investment.) My Tales experience is thus a mixed bag, and I was looking forward toplaying Tales of Hearts R, hopingthat it would provide me with unequivocally positive feelings and erase theuneasiness I feel around the series: after all, Tales of Hearts has been deemed one of the best Tales entries ever produced, both in itsoriginal, Japanese-only incarnation released in 2008 and its Vita-revampedincarnation released in 2013 and 2014. So, did Tales of Hearts R rise to the occasionand manage to redeem the series in my eyes? Well, it did for the most part, andquite brilliantly at that. I definitely loved that game and deeply enjoyed the40 hours I spent playing it, and I can totally envision myself doing the wholething all over again in an undetermined future. And yet, the picture is notperfect, as you certainly guessed from reading the title of this post. While itis true that I loved Tales of Hearts R,I could have adored it. In fact, I did adore it at first; but as playing hourswent by, my adoration somehow cooled down to become some kind of lukewarm affection.It was still love all right, but it was definitely not as fervent as the fondnessI had felt during the early stages of the game, which I deeply regretted—andstill regret. Let’s now see how this loss of love unfolded during my run of Hearts R—with SPOILERS included, as you might expect!The beauty of simplicityIt’s notexaggerated to say that I fell in love with HeartsR within the very first minutes of playing it. I was instantly charmed bythe overall aesthetics, all crystalline colours, sleek lines and gorgeousvistas—although the bland world map could have enjoyed a bit more love, as wellas some of the dungeons. The contrast with the more retro-oriented, pixelatedaesthetics of the original Tales ofHearts is striking; and yet, somehow, the two games manage to evince thesame slightly dreamy atmosphere—an atmosphere I was, and still am, very fond of. (It’s worth noting that Namcocannot be blamed for having lazily ported Talesof Hearts from one system to the next: the game went through a completeoverhaul, both graphically and in terms of gameplay mechanics.)I wasjust as smitten with the fighting system, which is an intoxicating blend ofAction-RPG and Hack and Slash mechanics. Battles are random and take place in aseparate arena in which you’re free to move at will and attack enemies from anyangle. This is similar to the fighting system used in Tales of the Abyss and represents a major departure from the systempresent in the original Tales of Hearts,which sported a side view of the action and relied more on carefully timedattacks, parries and retreats. These changes make the fighting in Hearts R more frantic and fast-paced,especially during boss fights, where moving constantly is pretty much the keyto survival. As in former Talesinstalments, you can switch between characters at will during battle, assignArtes to specific button combinations for every character and customizefighting strategies with a delighting amount of precision. Even neater, theA.I. is nothing short of stellar: your allies can take care of themselvesincredibly well, retreating when necessary, healing the whole group profuselyand reviving dead party members without any input from you, and they dutifullyfollow the strategies you assign to them. This fighting system is really quitethe gem, clear-cut and streamlined without ever being boring or repetitive, andI enjoyed it all from the first battle to the last one. I alsodeeply enjoyed the overall user-friendliness of Hearts R. This is a game that is utterly dedicated to making yourgaming easier—in sharp contrast with Talesof the Abyss, which seemed to go out of its way to make your life moremiserable. (Jeez, I should write a post about this game one day.) Theleveling-up system is easy to grasp and use: on top of gaining levels, you reapsome points that you must allocate to five virtues/qualities in a dedicatedmenu. Once you get a certain number of points, you gain new Artes, Skills andweapons to equip: simple and straightforward, just as I like leveling-upsystems to be. To make things even better, you gain levels quite oftenthroughout the whole game—even during the very last hours, which usually rathershow a slowdown in this department. Let’s also mention that all cutscenes can be skipped, evenduring your first run: this is absolutely a blessing, especially when you’reforced to make several attempts at a boss fight preceded by a cutscene. (Yep,I’m totally speaking from experience there.) Also, shops always have theproducts they offer in stock. While this may seem pretty obvious for an RPG, itis not as far as the Tales series isconcerned: Tales of the Abyss’ shopswere regularly out of stock for unfathomable reasons, forcing the player tobacktrack or go forward in order to buy the goods they needed. (This stillmakes my teeth grind, seriously.) Cherry on top of the convenience cake,sidequests are available at all times—sometimes long before you can actuallyfulfill them—and the characters presenting you with said sidequests areidentified by a yellow question mark floating over their heads. Now, maybe thisgoes a step to far in terms of hand-holding; but I’d chose this configurationten times over the infuriating one present in Tales of the Abyss, where sidequests were available only during ashort period of time and not signaled as such, which could lead one to mistakethem for plot-relevant quests. (Once again, experience speaking.)   The gamealso had me wrapped around its finger with its gripping pacing. During thefirst 20 hours, time flies by as you visit one town after the other, exploredungeons without a hitch and run ever forward, driven by a palpable sense ofurgency as you’re embroiled in an pressing quest in which every second matters.There is not the slightest hint of backtracking and things flow unhindered, andI really found myself more than eager to tackle the next milestone in line. Infact, the pacing in the first half of HeartsR is simply one of the best pacing that I’ve ever encountered in a J-RPG,especially a story-driven one. It is compelling and intoxicating, and it makesyou feel like your actions truly matter in writing the game’s history. This isnot an easy feat, and Hearts R mustbe praised abundantly for mastering that delicate alchemy between storytellingand player’s input and giving the impression that what the player does makes adifference in the game world—at least during its first half. Things turn sourin the second half, as we’ll see later; but that doesn’t erase or nullify theachievement of this compelling first half, which boasts an enthralling pacingnot matter what. Last butnot least, Tales of Hearts R capturedmy heart with its storyline, which issimple and limpid yet strangely riveting. In an era where J-RPGs feel compelledto brandish complicated and inflated storylines to distinguish themselves fromtheir peers, the clear-cut and unpretentious narrative of Hearts R was a delicious breath of fresh air. (SPOILERS ahead!) Here’s the gist of it: playing as the young,lively and a-bit-dumb-yet-pure-hearted Kor Meteor, you find an unknown girlpassed on the beach next to your home village, bring her home and offer herhelp… and end up accidentally shattering her soul, or “Spiria Core” as thesethings are called in Hearts R’sworld, all under the eyes of her brother who joined the fray in the meantime.Nice job rescuing people, Mr. Clumsy! Of course, you have to repair yourhorrendous mistake, and thus ensues a desperate quest to collect the fragmentsof the girl’s Spiria Core before less scrupulous individuals get their hands onthem—these things are laden with strong emotions, see, and canbe used to nefarious purposes such as manipulating people. Of course, there arehints that the girl and her brother, Kohaku Hearts and Hisui Heartsrespectively, harbour deeper and darker secrets: a shady sorceress is out toget their heads, a mysterious woman seems to live within Kohaku’s Spiria Core,and a conveniently vague and ominous prophecy gives you an inkling that moreserious developments may lurk ahead. This all promised a compelling tale abouttaking responsibility for your actions, fixing your mistakes and amending yourbehaviour, mixed with a sweet budding love story—I mean, which boy wouldn’t fallin love with a girl whose soul they are patiently rebuilding, and which girlwouldn’t become smitten with a boy who is dutifully collecting the pieces ofher soul? This whole collecting affair could have turned into a giant boringfetch quest involving an indefinite number of nebulous MacGuffins, but itmanages to be exactly the opposite, thanks to the engrossing pacing that Imentioned above. The search for Kohaku’s Spiria Shards—much classier than“pieces of soul”, indeed— occupies the first half of the game and is clearlythe best part of it as far as narrative is concerned. The good ol’ incentive ofSaving the World is all well and nice, but striving to cure a young lady froman lifelong apathetic state in which youput her because of your own stupidity and recklessness turns out to be just ascompelling an incentive—maybe even more, because it is not as ridiculouslyoverused as the “Save the World” trope.  So, thisis the game I hopelessly fell in love with: a beautiful and straightforwardtale about taking one’s responsibilities unfolding in a gorgeous game worldwith crystalline aesthetics, complemented by a flowing adrenaline-ladenfighting system and a pleasant accessibility. Alas, this adoration was notmeant to last: I should have known that “simplicity” and “JRPG” is the biggestoxymoron ever, and that this initial limpidity that I treasured so much was notmeant to last. And sure enough, it was only the prelude to the game royally soilingitself.  Overplaying the partLet’s beblunt: the second half on the game, i.e. the last twenty hours, is asickeningly glorious exercise in fake longevity. For some reason, Namco feltcompelled to overinflate their game in various ways, ruining the gorgeoussimplicity that had prevailed in the first half of the game and sappingwhatever originality it had managed to muster. Indeed, the second half of thegame could be subtitled “Modern JRPG 101”: it is an amalgam of all the JRPGclichés of the last fifteen years—party member turned traitor turned good again,mechas slowly learning to feel emotions, heroes being the offspring ofcourageous warriors who sacrificed themselves to seal a foe forever but failedmiserably at it, impossible love story and much, much more—and thus comes across as utterly unimaginative andboring. Let’s now take a closer look at the various ways the game unraveledafter the halfway mark. Theuser-friendliness and gorgeous crystalline aesthetics endured until the veryend—the latter even increasing: the last third of the game is home to the mostbreathtaking vistas. The fighting system remained mostly preserved too, apartfrom one annoying detail: as the game went on, the fighting arenas became widerin order to accommodate spell-casting foes. While this may seeminconsequential, it had the annoying effect of forcing you to cross greaterdistances in order to attack enemies. This both lengthened battles and madethem more tedious, as you could spend a good chunk of your fighting time justrunning after moving enemies. Still, this was far from being the biggesthurdle; and had it been the only problem appearing in the second half of thegame, I wouldn’t even have bothered mentioning it. A muchmore serious issue was the unraveling of the pacing. The compelling urgencypresent in the first half of Hearts Ris put to death in the second half, as the game forces you to backtrack, makedetours and generally squander your energy in annoying wanderings. Dungeonsbecome larger without becoming more interesting in the process, bosses that youalready fought must be taken down a second or even a third time, and you spendmore time trying to locate that already visited town that you’re forced tovisit again than discovering new and exciting places. This dilution of thepacing is actually a collateral damage, and can solely be blamed on the biggestissue of Hearts R’s second half,which is none other than the collapse of the storyline. What awaste, indeed. I cannot find any other words to describe my disappointment athow the narrative of Tales of Hearts Revolved in the last twenty hours, going from a straightforward and limpid storyto an over-bloated attempt at epicness bursting at the seams with clichés.Sure, there were also clichés in thefirst half, such as the recurrent recklessness of Kor, the overprotectivenessof big brother Hisui towards little sister Kohaku and the obligatory lamemisunderstandings about peeping into the Ladies’ baths by accident; but theywere innocuous, and hardly noticeable. The clichés that plague the second half,on the other hand, are massive and unescapable. (SPOILERS ahead.) Here’s what happen in a nutshell: once the lastSpiria Shard is collected and Kohaku is herself again, we discover that thelady living in her Spiria is actually an extra-terrestrial being that took heras host when she—Kohaku, that is—was still in her mother’s womb. But that’s notall: in the same breath, we also discover that Kor himself hosts such a being,unbeknownst to everyone, and that this being dressed like a disco superstar isactually malevolent and wants to release the power of one of the moons orbitingaround the heroes’ planet—which happens not to be a moon at all, but rather agiant flower-shaped artificial organism called Gardenia whose sole purpose isto suck Spirias. Huh, really? Gee,talk about imaginations running wild.  For allthe ludicrousness of this development, this is not even the worst narrative sincommitted by the game. This could actually have passed if it had been handledproperly: the “aliens living in Spirias” plot twist comes across asconveniently shocking while not popping up entirely out of the blue, and Creed,the ultimate bad guy dressed as ABBA in their heyday, is threatening enough togive you the desire to eradicate him on the spot. And that is what should have happened, in my opinion: Iwas so pumped up when Creed revealed himself that I wanted to finish himimmediately, after taking down his cronies one by one in the most epic showdownof them all. Instead, the game forced me to run away from these fights, kicking and screaming… Only to make me spend the next bloody twenty hours trying to find a way to reach Creed and hiscrew again after they escaped into a flying fortress and set up to rouseGardenia. This, ladies and gentlemen, is clearly the bloodiest,dirtiest narrative crime Tales of HeartsR is guilty of. To reveal the identity of the big baddy at the halfway markis not only stupid, it is also totally counter-productive: anybody could figureout that after twenty hours of pursuing said big baddy, even the most motivatedplayer will be bored to death and have lost all their motivation to set thingsright—anybody but the guys at Namco, that is. Sure, they tried to make thatover-extended second half easier to swallow by stuffing it with flashbacks, characterdevelopment and various twists and turns, but this simply does not work. All these events come across as hurdles andhindrances whose sole purpose is to extend the game’s longevity, and that is exactly what they are. But there isworse: in the context of Hearts R’sstoryline, this development is purely and simply unbelievable. We are talkingabout saving the world from a giant alien menace; I will gloss over theunbearable platitude of the whole premise to concentrate on how ludicrous it is compared to the game’sprevious events. To put it simply, your party is not up to the task. Thismiscellaneous crew of characters from all walks of life was competent enough tocollect pieces of a girl’s Spiria, but saving the world seems just too huge atask for their frail shoulders. No matter how hard the game tries to convinceyou that they can do it by shoving the old “If we’re united we can overcome anyobstacle!” credo down your throat until you vomit it, it is simply not believable, not even remotely. Thisdevelopment is too wide a stretch, and it comes across as redundant J-RPG fare:saving a single girl was not enough, oh no—they had to throw the whole worldinto the mix.    I havenothing against saving the world in JRPGs, mind you; but the way Hearts R presented things is just tooclumsy and hard to swallow. The transition between “Piecing a Spiria together”and “Saving the World” is way too abrupt—“inexistent” would actually be closerto the truth, even though the game tries to squeeze in a sequence in which yourparty ponder their options and wonder if they are up to the task—yet afterthat, events take much too long to unfold until the final showdown. Namco couldhave made these developments much easier to digest by either: a) Letting usfight Creed and his cronies right after they revealed themselves and before they actually endangered theworld for good by rousing Gardenia, thus putting an end to the game around the20 hour-mark, or b) Cutting the game in two distinct parts—the first aboutcuring Kohaku and the second about saving the world—and letting a good amountof in-game time pass between them. The latter was done in a good number ofgames, from Solatorobo to Popolocrois, to great results; and itwould certainly have worked just as well in HeartsR. The whole “Saving the World” business would have seem much moreplausible if a couple of years had elapsed between the two halves of Hearts R, giving the characters theopportunity to train and become accomplished fighters instead of the bunch ofmisfits they are, and the issue of the abrupt transition would have evaporatedaltogether. The two instalments could have been sold separately, à la Tales of the World, or put together onthe same cartridge and separated from one another by credits à la Solatorobo. Of course, the option ofletting us fight Creed and his crew right after they revealed themselves andending the game there was also perfectly viable. It would have been all themore viable as we do not actuallyfight Gardenia itself at the end—the game fortunately didn’t step as far aspitting us against an moon-sized alien entity—but rather Creed, after which themenace is eradicated for good. This outcome reinforces the feeling thatGardenia was only used as some kind of plot device to increase tension—to noavail, as far as I was concerned—and that things could have been dealt withtwenty hours before, when we first uncovered Creed and his crew. But I guess suchan option was simply out of the question: the game would then have been slanderedfor being way too short, clocking at “only” 20-or-so hours. Oh, well. Thatbeing said, I don’t want to sound overly negative: I did love the second half of the game too, and I didn’t exactly haveto force myself to finish it. Fighting was still just as compelling, the vistaswere just as gorgeous, and the lovely ending was just what I expected, lettingus (SPOILER) witness Kohaku andKor’s sweet love confession to one another (END OF SPOILER). All in all, I’m really glad that I finished thatgame, and I enjoyed every minute spent playing it. To end on an unashamedlypositive note, I am quite optimistic about any future run of Hearts R: now that I know what toexpect, I won’t be disappointed again and I’ll certainly be more able to enjoythe game for what it is instead of projecting my own expectations on it.Although Heart R’s story ended upbeing longer and more convoluted than I had hoped for, the game still managedto redeem the series in my eye and make me want to try more Tales entries. I certainly love it tentimes more than Tales of the Abyss,at any rate, and I will undoubtedly play it again. I’m also quite curious aboutthe DS original; and since I actually own it, I will probably play it sooner orlater, if only to satisfy my insatiable curiosity regarding gaming history.Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Sonic Boom-Shattered Crystal: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder", "date": "12/04/2015", "text": "Why sucha title, and what does it have to do with the Sonic series in general and with this game in particular? Well,quite a lot, actually. Depending on how you look at it, Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal can be either a miserable andpointless failure or a commendable and entertaining offering, and whether itappears as one or the other depends entirely on one’s stance towards the Sonic series in general and towards thatgame in particular.Whetheryou’re a Sonic aficionado or not, youmust be aware of the abject critical and commercial failure suffered by the Sonic Boom sub-series. It comprises onlytwo games—and will probably never comprise more—that were hailed as a brand-newstart and a departure for the ageing series: they were supposed to introducenew gameplay mechanics and bring a breath of fresh air to the Sonic universe. That fresh air turned rottenas the pair was utterly destroyed by critics as soon as it landed on shelvesand condemned to the deepest pits of gaming hell. Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal was not as severely mauled as its WiiU counterpart when it was released in late 2014, but it still reaped the filthyscores of 47 on Metacritic and 47.45 on Gamerankings. These slightly higherratings may be due to the fact that ShatteredCrystal was handled by a different—and more competent—developer, namelySanzaru Games, or simply to the fact that expectations regarding portable gamesare slightly lower than expectations regarding home console games; but whateverthe reason, Shattered Crystal failedmiserably all the same and was chewed by critics nearly as vengefully as itsWii U counterpart. The revamped character designs, which had focused criticismprior to the games’ arrival, became a mere detail lost in a torrent of venomouscomplaints, gripes and grievances targeting virtually every single aspect ofthe games—the Sonic Boom subserieswent boom, indeed. In fact,the level of hatred found in the huge majority of the reviews for Shattered Crystal is seriously uncanny. There is so much contempt, anger andresentment dripping from these reviews that you’d think that the game scammedthe reviewers and emptied their bank accounts or even murdered one of theiracquaintances. Shattered Crystal actuallycommitted an even worse crime—at least as far as gaming criticism is concerned:it failed to meet reviewers’ expectations. This is a serious offense, and onethat the Sonic series has been guiltyof numerous times in the last fifteen years, and reviewers reacted to it withthe righteous fury of people who have been wronged just one time too much. Shattered Crystal acted as some kind oflast straw and received a torrent of hate and ire and return—a torrent that, inmy opinion, was mostly undeserved. However, another gamer with a differentstance on the matter may think that ShatteredCrystal got the beating it was asking for, and their opinion would be validtoo. The truth is that Shattered Crystalis a two-faceted game, and that proved to be its downfall: it is both a lovelyaction-adventure game and a crappy Sonicgame. Sonic in name onlyIndeed,a gamer who expects Shattered Crystalto be a classic Sonic game with adistinct Sonic feel is headed for asore disappointment. Sure, it says “Sonic”on the box, and the original crew is there—still very much recognizable despitethe revamped designs—along with other distinctive features of the series, butit still doesn’t feel like a canon Sonic game at all. In fact, it couldprobably have accommodated totally different characters without anybodyscreaming rip-off.Theweirdest part is that if one’s eyes are to be believed, Shattered Crystal should feel like a classic Sonic game. Heck, it certainly plays the part visually: it is a 2Dside-scrolling platformer all right, very similar to Sonic Generations in terms of art style, modelization and cameradynamic, and it features beloved staples of the series such as rings, shields,high-speed ramps and bouncers. It also faithfully integrates a handful of classicgameplay mechanics, such as Sonic’s Spin Dash, Tails’ ability to fly and theHoming Attack. And yet, despite all these efforts, that distinctive Sonic vibe that the series’ aficionadosknow and love is entirely absent. Playing ShatteredCrystal is like playing a game that pretends really hard to be a Sonic game by donning the series’clothes, yet fails at delivering a believable Sonic impersonation. The reasons for this uncanny unfamiliarity does not lie in thefeatures that are present in ShatteredCrystal, but rather in the featuresthat are absent from it. For reasonsunfathomable, Sanzaru Games decided to remove some defining elements that havealways been at the core of the 2D Sonicinstalments, creating thus this weird game that looks like a Sonic entry but doesn’t taste like one.Here are the features that are conspicuous by their absence, convenientlybroken down for your convenience:—Theupbeat and frenzy musical accompaniment typical of the series is nowhere to beheard in Shattered Crystal. In itsplace plays a rather subdued and entirely forgettable soundtrack that is moresoporific than thrilling. There are a couple of good themes, such as the onethat plays in the first level, but this soundtrack sounds for the most part asthough it has been lifted from some crappy adventure flick. This is clearly mymain gripe with Shattered Crystal,and the presence of such a boring and unimaginative soundtrack in a Sonic games was so unbearable that Iplayed the whole game with the sound off after the first level. —Thevisual identity that has always defined the 2D instalments of the series—allbright colours, detail-laden backgrounds and levels with very distinctiveatmospheres—is nowhere to be seen in ShatteredCrystal. Although the game is undeniably gorgeous and very pleasant to lookat, the vivid colours have been replaced by pastel hues, the background havebeen emptied of most flourishes and the levels, while still different from oneanother, do not sport anymore some very recognizable themes—Ancient Egypt,Water Labyrinth or Artic Circle, to quote only a few. Once again, there aresome exceptions: the Fire Level and its silhouetted gameplay is just a greatidea and looks really gorgeous—not to mention that it’s one of the few occurrences of a Fire Level in the series, which makes is a curiosity byitself. Also, the first level boasts a Tropical theme, in pure Sonic tradition. Still, there’s nodenying that this game is visually more subdued and vanilla than your average2D Sonic game, and anybody expecting pyramids, ice loops and parade lights willdefinitely be disappointed. Heck, you can’t even dip a toe in water in thatgame!—Lastbut certainly not least, speed itselfis nowhere to be enjoyed in ShatteredCrystal, neither as a key gameplay mechanic nor as a reward. This iscertainly the most stinging omission of the bunch and the one that had manyreviewers frothing at the mouth. Sanzaru Games themselves recognized at somepoint that neglecting the speed factor had been a dire mistake and that theyhadn’t anticipated the uproar such a move would generate. Think about it: notonly is Sonic not an inch faster than its teammates, which is already a heresy,but the whole gameplay itself is notbased on speed. Sure, you can run and even dash around thanks to a Boost move, butit serves no other purpose than, well… crossing the levels a tad faster. Theuse of speed doesn’t grant you access to exclusive areas nor is ever necessaryto survive à la Sonic Rush, and it doesn’t act as a well-deserved reward like in the original Sonic trilogy. Sure, there are some bursts of breakneck speed in which yourcharacters are propelled along a high-speed ramp with camera flourishes forgood measure—classic modern Sonicfare, shall we say. Unfortunately, the semi-scripted nature of these sequencesprevent them from being any rewarding: there is nothing to feel accomplishedabout, since the action will take place without any special input from theplayer. Ironically, the very presence of these ramps in the game feels morelike a half-hearted homage, a testimony to the fact that Shattered Crystal is supposed to be a Sonic game, than like a rock-solid gameplay mechanic. Aswell-executed as these sequences may be, they don’t replace a meaningful andcohesive integration of speed in the gameplay.All inall, the high-octane, frenzied atmosphere so typical of the classic 2D Sonic entries is nowhere to be found in Shattered Crystal. If the presence ofsuch an atmosphere is the touchstone of awesome Sonic-ness, then the conclusionis implacable: Shattered Crystal is abad Sonic game. There’s no way thisgame can be a good Sonic game withoutthe thrilling music, the eye-popping aesthetics, the mind-blowing speed and thegeneral chutzpah that came to be associated with the series over the years.Does this mean that Shattered Crystalis a bad game full stop? Well, absolutely not.Not Sonic-good, yet still goodIndeed,an open-minded gamer who approaches this game as some kind of weird Sonic spin-off from a parallel universewill undoubtedly find a lot of goodness in it. It may be a crappy classic Sonic game, but it’s not a bad game per se: anyone who claims that eitherdid not play it or is too blinded by hatred to see the truth. Shattered Crystal is a very competentAction-Adventure platformer with undeniable qualities and is very much worthplaying if you’re an aficionado of the genre. It won’t treat you to thatclassic Sonic feel, but it has otherexcellent things to offer, and they are not to be sniffed at. Without furtherado, here’s a list of Shattered Crystal’svirtues:—Thegame boasts rock-solid physics that are utterly enjoyable and tight controlsthat many games could envy. Moving your characters around is deeply enjoyablethanks to this awesome combination: not only do they perform every requiredaction with delightful precision, but the actions themselves have some sort of deepphysicality that is a complete treat.You can feel yourself ram into things,erupt into a burst of speed or leap gracefully from one ledge to the next, andit’s incredibly pleasant and rewarding. There is not a trace of the mushinessand lack of precision so often encountered in lower-tier platformers andaction-adventure games, and this is a feat that should definitely beacknowledged and praised when discussing ShatteredCrystal. —Greatphysics and tight controls would amount to nothing if they were not put to gooduse. Fortunately, they are indeed put to—very—gooduse in Shattered Crystal: the gametreats us to an excellent brand of platforming that makes the most of thephysics and the controls, and manages to renew the gameplay of the series in anastounding way. This was a risky move if there ever was one, given how touchythe Sonic fan base can be, and itdidn’t reap the expected rewards and praise; nonetheless, this brand-newgameplay is not only entirely functional, but also deeply enjoyable in its ownright. Unlike any other 2D Sonic instalment, ShatteredCrystal features a gameplay that is mostly aerial-based: moves such asmid-air dashes, homing attacks and a brand-new double jump are used profuselyto progress through the stages. SonicColours on the DS had already flirted with this kind of aerial gameplay,but the results were mostly unsatisfactory and lacked much-needed precision; inShattered Crystal, on the other hand,the control over your characters’ actions is total, and moving around inmid-air become a sheer joy instead of a chore that you endure while grindingteeth. Add to this excellent aerial base a couple of extra moves such asKnuckles’ Burrowing and Stich’s Boomerang-Throwing, and you get a vibrantgameplay full of variety that always manages to keep the game fresh. —Lastbut not least comes the very distinctive and unique atmosphere of Shattered Crystal. The long levels withtheir grand vistas must be explored carefully several times over instead ofrushed through; combine this with the near-absence of speed and theaerial-based gameplay, and you get a game that is deeply, well… Relaxing. Soothing, in a somewhatatmospheric way. Putting “Sonic” and“relaxing” in the same sentence is as close to blasphemy as it gets, and yet,it cannot be denied: Shattered Crystalis a deeply relaxing game, a game that made me feel all mellow every time Iplayed it. It is probably the only Sonicgame that can be used to chill out, and will probably be the only one ever; andto be honest, I would nearly regret this. As much as I adore the fast-paced anddelirious atmosphere of the classic 2D Sonicgames, I also deeply enjoyed the soothing quality of Shattered Crystal, and Ireally wouldn’t be against seeing more of it in subsequent Sonic entries. This is obviously wishful thinking: after thecritical debacle endured by ShatteredCrystal, the relaxing orientation will undoubtedly be buried forever. Well,at least I have this game to cherish. Indeed, Shattered Crystal is a jolly good gamein its own right. It combines a unique soothing atmosphere with delightfulphysics, tight controls and a varied and interesting gameplay with deep andsolid platforming roots and a tang of action-adventure to spice up the mix.This is very un-Sonic, and yet it’sdeeply enjoyable. To appreciate this game for what it is can be difficult: itmay require us to reconcile conflicted feelings about the Sonic series—feelings that can often take us all the way back tothe series’ inception. Coming to terms with the series’ evolutionOne factcan hardly be denied: the most devoted and enduring Sonic aficionados are the ones who discovered the Blue Blur on theSega consoles in the beginning of the 16-bit era, some 25 years ago. We saw thefeisty hedgehog come to life, in a flurry of colourful pixels, and we fell inlove with him, often at first sight—or play. The first Sonic games showered us with exhilarating and brand-new gaming sensationsthat embedded themselves into our memories, and the series gained a specialspot in our soft gamer’s hearts. As time and gaming systems went by, weexpected the series to sweep us off our feet with its every entry, as it did inthe early days; however, the magic of these glorious debuts seemed hard toconjure up again. The series stubbornly refused to dazzle and shine as it didin the 16-bit era, preferring instead to experiment and wander around—sometimesto cringing results, but also sometimes to excellent ones. Alas, we couldn’tspot and enjoy all these gems: as games were released and failed to enraptureus with the same force as the original instalments, we retreated in some kindof critical ivory tower, sniffing and spitting at the new entries whileexpectantly checking the gaming horizon for a sign—any sign—that the series wason its way back to its former glory. So far, such a sign has yet to come.Let’s bebrutally honest: it will probably never come, no matter how long we wait. Notbecause the Sonic series is destinedto mediocrity—far from it, at least in my opinion—but because we, as a collective group of old-timerswho grew up with Sonic, do not want tosee that sign. It became pretty obvious over the years that innovations,whatever they may be, are not well-received atall as far as the Sonic Series isconcerned. Every new gameplay mechanic is met with critical mauling—oftendeserved, but sometimes not. (Case in point: Shattered Crystal.) However, sticking to old-school gameplay ortrying to go back to the series’ glorious roots doesn’t do the trick either anddoesn’t make us any happier. The GBA and DS entries, which feature gameplaysand overall atmospheres that are the closest thing to the 16-bit era ones, aregenerally ignored and glossed over; and Sonic4, which is a vibrant tribute to the 16-bit instalments loaded withshameless fan-service, was chewed by critics and fans and is regarded as aworthless pile of trash. Let’sface it: there may be no way to satisfy us old-timers, to give us back theamazing feelings and sensations that the Sonicseries elicited when we first discovered it. For one thing, the type ofgameplay that brought Sonic toprominence, i.e. 16-bit era generic platforming, is utterly dated nowadays: ithas lost its appeal and freshness many years ago and could certainly not sweepus off our feet anymore. Sure, Mario, Rayman and Kirby are still around thegaming block, starring in games that are reminiscent of their own 16-bit eramoments of glory, but let’s be honest: their popularity in that field is ashadow of what it used to be at that time, when platforming as a genre was atits peak. 16-bit era platforming—and Sonic along with it—may in its time berevived and glorified by the independent scene in the same way 8-bit eraplatforming is being brought to life and paid homage to in tons of indie gamesright now; but until then, any Sonic16-bit era revival would better stay buried and wait for its time. If thedebacle of Sonic 4 proved something,it’s definitely that we are not yet ready for starry-eyed, reference-ladenhomages to 16-bit platformers, no matter how much we loved them. Then, there isthe crucial nostalgia factor: we have very likely embellished our first stepswith the series beyond all recognition, creating a picture of pristineperfection that shines so brightly in our minds that it makes any new Sonic instalment pale in comparison. Even if we stepped on a Sonic game that were genuinely asbrilliant as the original entries, we wouldn’t recognize it for what it is, blinded as we are by our own nostalgia. Sowhat’s the way out? Can we ever be happy and fulfilled again playing Sonic, or is the Blue Blur condemned tobe our lost gaming love? Well, maybe the trick is to just go with the flow andtry to accept the series’ evolution. We still have the 16-bit era entries tocherish, and they’ll be there forever; knowing that we can come back to themwhenever we crave a fix of old-school Sonicgameplay, maybe we can relax a trifle and accept new directions and experimentswith an open mind, and enjoy them for what they are. Maybe that’s the supremekey to being at peace with the series once and for all: give up our rusty,near-fossilized ideas about what Sonicgames should be and take them forwhat they are instead. There is somegood in Shattered Crystal, althoughit doesn’t fit the bill as a perfect classic 2D Sonic game; and when we grumpy old-timers give up our unrealisticand contradictory expectations about the series, maybe we can finally see some beautyin that game—and countless other Sonicentries.  I loved Shattered Crystal, at any rate; but thatshould be, well… crystal-clear by now. It’s not a perfect game, but it deservedmuch better than being pummeled to death by critics the very second it wasreleased. It’s worth playing for the awesome physics and the soothingatmosphere alone, if nothing else: it’s not every day that a Sonic game can be deemed “relaxing”, ifever. And unfortunately, top-notch physics seem to have also deserted theseries lately, at least in its home console incarnations; all the moreincentive to try one’s hand at ShatteredCrystal’s stunningly honed physics. Give the game a chance, it so deservesit! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Shiren the Wanderer (4): Sayonara, my love", "date": "05/04/2015", "text": "Here comesmy fourth and last post about Shiren theWanderer. Describing my eventful run was entertaining enough and I couldhave stopped at that, but I felt that I needed to complete the picture bydelivering my ultimate thoughts about the game. Without further ado, let’s putan end to my musings about Shiren!Freedom is mine—and yours too EverythingI said in my first post about Shirenstill stands, despite the fact that I wrote it a good year ago. I was anewcomer to both the roguelike genre and the Shiren series back then, and I was still under the false impressionthat there was a clear-cut, so-called “right” way to play such games in generaland Shiren in particular. If there isone thing that I discovered in the meantime, it is definitely the fact that thereis no such thing as a “right” way of playing Shiren: this game is anything but linear and forceful, preferringinstead to treat the players to a staggering, nearly dizzying amount offreedom. I happen to be a freedom-hungry gamer, but even I had never dreamt ofa game that would leave the player entirely free to experiment at will within afixed set of rules. There is no canonical way to play Shiren, indeed: the only thing that matters is to progress,regardless of how you do it, and the right way to play that game is the waythat suits you. If there ever was agame that you could play your way, then Shirenhas to be that game, and I love it to pieces for it.Not onlydoes Shiren lavish a generous amountof freedom on you, but it also endows you with similarly large doses ofautonomy and responsibility. You are in charge of your run from beginning toend, and it’s up to you to design your own strategies, manage your inventoryand progress as smoothly as possible. Since the game’s rules are fixed andnever vary (or nearly so—more about that in just a bit), any mistake you makeis yours only; but so is every victory, however small it may be. Shiren’s world is rough, dangerous andunforgiving, but it can be navigated with the right amount of care, preparationand patience. It is a formidable challenge: there is no hand-holding and verylittle to ease your way through, but you can still learn, slowly but surely,and use every shred of gained knowledge to progress further. The ultimatevictory that crowns that painstaking yet compelling process is all the sweetest,as it gives you the priceless feeling of having succeeded against all odds. Shiren makes you toil and sweat morethan any other game, but it also offers you the immense satisfaction of overcoming numerous hazards and perils by relying solely on your finely honedstrategies, and that’s a deeply fulfilling reward that is not so often encountered inthe gaming landscape—at least, not since the end of the 8-bit era. Fake difficulty averted—or nearly soShiren being a game as tough as nails, it wouldn’thave been too surprising to discover that it indulged generously in fakedifficulty. The frontier between fair and fake difficulty is a thin one indeed,and can be crossed oh so easily; and yet, amazingly, Shiren manages to stay on the fair side.  It does so by implementing rules that arestrict and unforgiving—sometimes even downright sadistic—yet unchanging. Thisallows the player to learn and thus to anticipate future events as well asdevise strategies to overcome obstacles, and it works like a charm all throughthe game. That is, except in one case. There is indeed one exception to that ironrule about unvarying rules, and it is embodied by your allies: Pekeji, Oryu andKeichi, aka the Deceptive Ones. Thebehaviour of these three is the closest thing to randomness that you’ll find inShiren. Keichi’s Healing Massages canoccasionally hurt you and deplete your health bar instead of refilling it,Oryu’s long-range attacks miss their mark as often as not, and Pekeji has theseinfuriating habits of misaiming his punches straight at your face on a regularbasis and of gorging on your precious Riceballs without any discernable hungerpattern. This is already bad enough, and it stings all the more when you addthe fact that this trio is all wild and uncontrollable: they can abandon you inthe blink of an eye to run after an enemy at the far end of the screen or marchstupidly on a sleeping enemy that would have been better left dozing off. Toadd insult to injury, there is no way to bring them back to you once they startstraying away, which forces you to run after them or forge ahead without them.Even worse is the fact that you cannot check the state of their health at all:for all you know, they could be on the brink of death at any given moment. Notthat knowing it would be useful, mind you, since there is no reliable way toheal them: throwing Herbs at them works only occasionally and staying at an Inndoesn’t restore their health one bit. And of course, you can’t expect them tolook after themselves either, for instance by doing something as sensible asretreating when they are hurt: their only course of action is to plantthemselves in front of enemies and suffer blows until they pitifully die. Well,at least you can learn how not toplay by observing their behaviour; it’s better than nothing, I guess. All in all,the behaviour of these so-called allies is so random and hindering that it has to have been designed that way onpurpose. I wouldn’t been surprised if these three were conceived from theget-go as a way to take the piss out of the player for wanting to ease theirway through by resorting to allies: instead of offering reliable foils, thegame throws in characters that are more akin to giant boulders dragging youdown. This trio is a huge practical joke played on the player, teaching themthat there is no easy way in Shirenand that only relying on one’s own resources and wits can lead one to victory.While I certainly appreciate the humour of it all, it doesn’t change the factthat this trio of allies creates some fake difficulty by sporting such anunreliable behaviour. It is hard to integrate them in any kind of strategy becausetheir patterns are not predictable, and they can even put you in hot water byacting so randomly, like when they die while fighting a monster and make saidmonster level up and become ten times more dangerous—and of course, you’re leftalone to deal with the thing. Why, thank you so much! I guess there must be someways to integrate them in some strategies if you rack your brain hard enough,but I found much more comfortable to avoid their company entirely most of thetime. I only manage to put them to use efficiently in the first floors: I wouldretreat behind them when facing Pickpockets in order to avoid having my Gitanslicked away, and managed to save a substantial amount of money that way. Still,that’s really a poor compensation for all the trouble I went through to recruitthem in the first place, and I may well abstain from that hassle in my next runof Shiren. Fake longevity—up the wazooIronicallyenough, while Shiren manages togracefully avoid fake difficulty and dabbles in it only for the sake ofteaching the player a good lesson about roguelike philosophy, it indulgesshamelessly in fake longevity. Now that’ssurprising: I would have thought that the game’s relentless difficulty alonewould suffice to provide a decent number of gaming hours—all the more so whilecombined with the huge postgame content. And yet, Chunsoft seems to havethought that this was not enough, and thus devised and implemented a bunch offeatures whose sole purpose it to force you to play longer than strictlynecessary. Lo and behold, here’s the list of impediments:—There isno way to warp back to town from the depths of the dungeons. There is not asingle item that can return you there, nor is there any kind of portal ortransportation mean that can take you back to the safety of one of the game’svillages. Your only option is to go forward until you reach the next town inline, or to backtrack until you reach the town you just passed—the latter beingpossible only in the first half of the game, i.e. until Cryptic Rock Valley.Now, this is just plain mean, and utterly exaggerated. There could have been atleast a returning item, if nothing else: make it rare if you wish, but give ussomething. Give us something that could save us some time and spare us thechore of crawling back to the last town or forward to the next one whilepraying not to die. Give us something that could save our hide when we’re onthe brink of death and spare us the chore of starting all over againempty-handed. Do you see the fake longevity at work now? And still, I guess wecould deem ourselves fortunate with this DS port: from what I’ve read, theoriginal SNES instalment didn’t allow the player to backtrack at all. I shudder when thinking of howimpossibly longer my run would have become if I couldn’t have gone back andforth between towns in the first half of the game.—Items areridiculously expensive and money is hard to come by. As a result, scraping upenough gitans to buy whatever you’re longing for is more often than not atedious process that involves scouring every inch of every floor, picking up everyitem in sight before going all the way back to Bamboo Village to sell them and—lastbut certainly not least—avoiding being cornered by Pickpockets at all costs.This painstaking collection of money can be extremely time-consuming, and doesn’teven have the grace to wield unfailing results. Sometimes, you don’t manage tocollect the necessary amount of money no matter how hard you try; when thishappens, the only option is to restart the whole process from scratch. For, loand behold…—There isno bank in Shiren, nor any otherreliable way to save your hardly collected money. In practice, it means thatwhatever purchase you plan must be made in the course of a single adventure,and whatever money you may have left after the deed is done is doomed to belost forever when you die/give up on your current adventure. If the absence ofany way to warp back to town was mean, this absence of money storage isdownright sadistic: I’m sure I could have bought a dozen Melting Jars just withthe money that I was forced to relinquish as I moved on to the next adventurein line. And let’s not even mention all these aborted runs during which Ididn’t manage to collect the desired amount of money because I was killed inthe process or because the game had decided to play stingy. Now that’s fakelongevity served on a silver platter.—The tworesident smithies of the game can upgrade your sword only once per adventure. Ithink this is pretty self-explanatory: instead of allowing you to upgrade yourweapon as much as your funds will allow, the game forces you to restart a wholenew adventure as soon as you’re done visiting the smithies. The blacksmithseven tease you by saying “Come back later” if you ask them for another upgrade!How lazy can these guys be? Jeez, I’m sure I could have forged two Lv.60 MasterSwords with all the upgrading opportunities that I lost in the course of myrun. But wait, there is worse…—The smithiescannot upgrade shields. Yup, you readthat right. As a result, shields can only be upgraded by using the ridiculouslyexpansive Melding Jars or the not-so-common Earth Bless Scrolls. In practice,this means that you’ll have to scrape up money as I explained above in order tobuy the coveted Melding Jars AND find shields with interesting Seals and levelsto fuse with your main shield, as well as repeat adventures until you’re luckyenough to find some Earth Bless Scrolls. If you have enough money, you can goback and forth between Bamboo Village and the floor just before it in hope thatan Earth Bless Scroll will pop up as the Bamboo Village shop. It can be a bittedious, but it will reap rewards if you’re patient enough: I managed to get acouple of Earth Bless Scrolls as well as interesting shields by using thattrick. At any rate, brace yourself for some tedious and lengthy toiling, shouldyou decide to upgrade your shield all the way to its maximum level. Now that’s the cherry on top of the fakelongevity sundae. So, I thinkI’ve made my point: Shiren is rifewith fake longevity, no doubt due to its origins as a 16-bit era title. Fakelongevity was pretty much the norm at that time, and every game pulled out suchdirty tricks to ensure that the player wouldn’t witness the credits too soon.In regards to its origins, I won’t slander Shirenfor making such generous use of fake longevity. This was the way of the early’90s, and such glimpses in the past eras of gaming always fascinate me, so Iwon’t complain too much—especially since Chunsoft tried to damper the fakelongevity at work by allowing backtracking in the first half of the game. Andfake longevity or not, I sincerely enjoyed every minute spent playing Shiren, and I am grateful for the veryexistence of that amazing gem of a game. I want toconclude that post and the whole Shirenepopee by exposing my most ridiculous death in the game. Any run of a roguelikeis bound to be littered with stupid and/or absurd deaths, and such deaths canbe worn as a badge of honor as well as the sweetest victories. I’ve alreadyexposed my sweetest moment in Shiren,i.e. the epiphany I had when I managed to escape a Monster House unscathed withonly a Switching Staff; now, it’s time to expose my most ridiculous death, theone that left me gaping at the screen in sheer incredulity over the stupidityof the whole thing. This happened in the Old Mine, on the 9th floorexactly. I was cruising around and trying to collect money to purchase aMelding Jar, armed with an already conveniently powered up Lv.30 Master Swordand a Lv. 14 Armor Shield. Oryu was guarding my back, and any resident enemywas hardly dealing more than one point of damage thanks to my Armor Shield, soI thought I was as safe as I could be, and didn’t bother healing myself when thelast Spike Bomb of the floor exploded at my face and took away half of my lifebar. I mean, I had explored the whole floor, killed all enemies and stood justone room away from the exit; what could happen at that point? Well, I’ll tellyou: walking on a Boulder Trap and being crushed to death because I didn’t haveenough HP left. I did SO not expect something like that to happen that I stoodfrozen for a few seconds, not believing what I just saw—not wanting to believe it. And yet, it didhappened, and I lost some excellent equipment in the process—all because I wascareless and let my guard down for a couple of seconds, making the fatalmistake of thinking that it was fine to cruise around with only half of my HP.This pretty much sums up the philosophy at work behind Shiren’s deceptively cute assemblages of pixels: always expect theworse, and don’t ever let your guard down. It’s nowtime to say goodbye to Shiren andTable Mountain. As I mentioned before, it’s not an adieu, neither in gaming nor in writing: I will most certainly playShiren again, as well as itssuccessors, and write about them while I’m at it. I’m really proud andoverjoyed to have cleared Shiren theWanderer: it feels like I have passed a test in rogueliking, and it gave mea lot of confidence in that department. I may be wrong, but I have this feeling that Shiren is somehow the New York of rogueliking: if I managed tobeat that old-school roguelike, then I can beat them all. We’ll see soon enoughif this holds true: I have a couple of other roguelikes in my gaming library,such as the two Izuna instalments andZHP Unlosing Ranger—not to mentionthe whole Shiren series—and I willtackle them as soon as I’m in the mood for rogueliking again, hopefully to greatsuccess. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Shiren the Wanderer (3): The end of the road", "date": "28/03/2015", "text": "Mywandering days are over at long last. I finally beat Shiren the Wanderer, after 54 hours and 174 adventures. And boy,what a ride it has been! From peaks of elation to pits of dismay, my long tripthrough Table Mountain was undoubtedly one of the rockiest video game runs I’veever had, but also one of the most fulfilling. Without further ado, let’s diveinto the last segment of my run and see how things unfolded until my ultimatevictory.I climbed it my wayAfter mytwo resounding failures at tackling Table Mountain, I kept trying, patientlyupgrading my equipment again before venturing ahead… and failed a third time,this time at the hands of a different enemy that I cannot remember. This thirddefeat was downright annoying; the whole pattern of upgrading my equipment onlyto die while facing unknown monsters was getting old, and I needed a breath offresh air. I then resolved to play the game in a slightly different way and seeif it would work better. This different way was the one advocated by seasoned Shiren players, i.e. not buffing up yourequipment and relying solely on whatever you find during the course of your currentadventure. On top of offering a welcome change of pace, this way of playingwould force me to develop my strategic skills and to use all the items at mydisposal instead of relying solely on my sword. The results were encouraging,to say the least: I progressed much further than I would have expected, evengoing as far as the 25th floor during one adventure. This way ofplaying was also immensely rewarding, as I found unexpected ways to escape fromthe most desperate situations: I swear that I had some kind of epiphany when Imanaged to escape from a Monster House-floor solely by using a Switching Staff toswitch places with a monster that stood next to the exit. Strategy does go along way in Shiren, indeed; afterthat, I became convinced that I could beat the game without resorting toupgraded equipment if I tried hard enough. However,there was a major issue with that way of playing. As fun and stimulating as itwas, it was also way too similar to the accursed platformers of my youth for mytaste and comfort. I was never too fond of the whole “die-and-retry” thing, andI’m even less fond of it now that I have a greater variety of games to play andless time on my hands. On top of that, I had already been playing Shiren for more than 40 hours at thatpoint, and gaming fatigue was starting to loom on the horizon. I neededclosure, and I needed it soon, or else I would drop Shiren again for another couple of months—or maybe forever. That waswhen, unbeknownst to me, I devised the ultimate strategy that would finallylead me to victory: to combine upgraded equipment and useful items with cutting-edgestrategies. To play as if I were weak and vulnerable, relying solely on mysuper-buffed equipment if no better tactics were available. This strategycatered to all sides of my gaming personality, mixing my love for planning andpatiently building up my strengths with my immoderate taste for puzzle andstrategy-laden games, and it promised to be the most fulfilling way of playingas far as I was concerned. I went into upgrading full force and ended up with aLv. 55 Armor Ward and a Lv. 65 Kabra Sword—both carrying a couple of useful sealsfor good measure. I also collected a couple of carefully selected items in theprocess; and after a last goodbye meal at Naoki’s restaurant, I finally venturedahead, my bag loaded with jars, my belly full and my heart fluttering withanticipation. Despitewhat I had pondered in my last post, I cleared the whole stretch betweenMountaintop Town and the Waterfall Cave in one go. It was then or never, andthe Winds of Fortune seemed to be on my side on that fateful day. I climbed andclimbed, working my way through countless hazards and disposing of enemies as cleverlyand safely as I could. I ended up in a tight spot a couple of times, the mostdangerous occurrence being when I was stuck at the entrance of a Monster Houseand repeatedly paralysed by three Mecharoids ganging up on me. I only managedto snatch a turn every once in a while, and my survival was solely due to myover-buffed Armor Ward that protected me from the numerous blows I had toendure before I managed to get rid of these pests. But I cleaved my way throughthis obstacle and the rest, until I finally found myself on the last flooragain, facing that dreaded Tainted Insect and its disgusting cronies for themost epic showdown of them all.This time,I was fully prepared and in control. I located the accursed Skull Wraith andswung my Postpone Staff at it first thing. Things didn’t work exactly asplanned, though: since the last level doesn’t have an exit to speak of, thecreature was not whisked away. However, it was paralysed for good, whichallowed me to concentrate on the threatening Tainted Insect that had crawledcloser to me in the meantime. I faced the foul thing and unleashed my ultimatestrategy, devised eons ago in the safety of Canyon Hamlet: I grabbed a piece ofMamel Meat from my inventory and threw it at the creature. The roast hit itstarget, and the massive insect turned instantly into an innocuous and powerlessMamel, jumping and quivering in distress at the thought of the terrible fatethat awaited it (my imagination going wild). One neat slash of my overpoweredKabra Sword, and the creature perished, along with all its cronies. I wasparalysed for a couple of seconds, my mind still reeling from the magnitude ofwhat I had just accomplished. I had killed the last boss! I had done it! After recovering from the shock, I started movingaround carefully, looking for the fabled Golden Condor. My steps were slowerand more careful than ever: for all I knew, the room could be bristling withtraps, and the last thing I wanted was to die stupidly after such a grandvictory. Nothing unpleasant happened, though: I found the Golden Condor andleft the place on its back, my hair flying in the wind. Then came the sweet,long-awaited ending (spoilers):people marvel at the sight of the Condor flying in the golden glow of theevening sun, everybody makes a wish, the Condor drops Shiren and flies towardsfreedom and lands unknown and Shiren walks away in the setting sun. Blame thison the “Lucky Luke” comics and cartoons that I used to devour when I was a kid,but I’ve always been a sucker for these ‘Hero-walks-toward-the-sunset’ endings.Blimey, I could even feel unshed tears of joy, relief and overall happinesswelling up in my eyes, and it felt amazingly good. Oh, what a ride! Beyond Table MountainI thenaccessed the vast postgame territory, with its new dungeons, travel means andopportunities. The first pleasant change is the brand-new dialogues: every NPCyou talk to congratulates you for your amazing feat and expresses their awe infront of your amazing self. That’s certainly a nice change from their formerlines that blended lukewarm encouragements with an ever-so-slight touch ofdoubt and compassion—heck, you could nearly hear them shaking their heads andthinking “ha, the delusions of youth. Soon this poor lad will be vulture’sfood”. Another neat feature is the possibility to travel instantly from CanyonHamlet to any other village in order to rally the postgame dungeons. Did Imention that you also get to keep your precious equipment as well as all youritems after you free the Golden Condor? Although it seems pretty normaloverall, I wouldn’t have been surprised in the slightest if the game had strippedme of my gear with a crappy justification—or no justification at all, for thatmatter. After all, we’re talking about Shiren,one of the most unforgiving games out there. At any rate, this display offairness was most welcome, and I put it to good use by clearing another ascentof Table Mountain. Of course, the Tainted Insect was gone, as well as theGolden Condor; the only thing I found was a golden feather left for me to pick up,marking thus the end to that second victorious run. Forcuriosity’s sake, I decided to sneak a peek at some of the postgame dungeons. Iventured through the Tainted Path first: it was challenging all right, withconsiderably more powerful versions of already encountered enemies, but it wasalso quite boring. The thrill of wanting to beat the game was gone, and afterhaving cleared 25 floors in a row, I started yawning and wondering how long wasthis dungeon exactly. I finally died on the 30th floor, and it feltlike a huge relief—especially since my masochistic dungeon-crawling impulseswould probably have pushed me to go on and on, no matter how boring the roamingwas. At any rate, it is crystal-clear that these postgame dungeons areconsiderably harder that Table Mountain and are designed to be explored whilerelying on heavily upgraded equipment. I then tried the God Kitchen Shrine,cleared three floors and died, and put the game down for good without tryingany other dungeon. I had gotten my fill of Shirenand didn’t feel like playing it any longer. From what I’ve read, most of thepostgame dungeons are considerably longer than Table Mountain itself; it’snearly like the game is starting for good once you free the Golden Condor—a feelingreinforced by the fact that the postgame dungeons contain tons of items thatare nowhere to be found in the main game, from shields and swords withinteresting seals to brand-new types of Scrolls and Staves. Well, I’ll passthis time, thank you very much. Maybe we’ll meet again on my next run, TaintedPath and co; for now, I’m moving to new pastures with a huge smile on my faceand no regrets. My work here is done—till next time.There willbe a next time, indeed, both in terms of gaming and writing. I will undoubtedlyplay Shiren again, as well as try myhand at its sequels—which are all part of my precious collection and willhopefully turn out to be as excellent as their elder, if not more. As forwriting, I will come back soon with a final post wrapping up that most amazingexperience of playing Shiren the Wanderer.Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Senran Kagura Burst (2): Too much of a good thing", "date": "22/03/2015", "text": "Here’s mysecond post about Senran Kagura Burst,and it will focus on the less stellar aspects of the game. After all the praise I lavished upon it, it should be pretty clear that I really loved SKB and had tons of fun playing it;however, my warm feelings for the game didn’t make me blind to its flaws. For SKB does have flaws, indeed, and rathernoticeable ones at that; they are not deal-breakers, but they are presentnonetheless and must be addressed, if only for the sake of equity andinformation. Without further ado, let’s examine SKB’s less glorious bits!Bigger is not always betterThe firstblatant flaw that I want to cover is the one I alluded to at the end of myfirst post, namely the overabundance of content. The game is divided into twodistinct storylines, the Hanzo Arc and the Hebijo Arc; both contain fivechapters, each chapter comprising fifteen stages. Multiply this by the totalnumber of characters, namely ten plus two hidden ones that can be unlocked onceyou beat the final boss, and you get a staggeringly humongous beast of a gamethat obviously require dozens of hours of gameplay to be cleared entirely. Despite mybest efforts, I didn’t manage to reach 100% completion for a single characterroute, let alone for the whole game, and I shudder while thinking of the amountof time needed to achieve such a feat. But wait, why exactly is that such ahuge issue, you may ask? Well, that excessive length is not an issue per se,but it is in SKB because of thenature of that game. Senran Kagura Burstis a Beat’em Up, not some J-RPG that has a complex story to tell. Beat’em Upbeing repetitive by nature, probably much more so than any other genre underthe gaming sun, it is nearly necessary is to keep them tight and short in orderto offer a fulfilling experience. Code of Princess understood that perfectly and kept its main campaign reasonablyshort while offering a lot of replay value thanks to its roster of characters. SKB, on the other hand, was way toogreedy and over-expanded itself to the same absurd proportions as the bosoms ofits heroines; as a result, it suffers from a watered-down, spread-out designthat dilutes its intensity. The main campaign is drowned under tons of extrastages that recycle already used settings adnauseam, and it is absolutely impossible to clear the full game in one go,which definitely robs you of the pleasant experience of picking up the game andcompleting a full run in a couple of intense hours. Of course, there is stillthe possibility of picking up the story-related stages one by one and clearingthese only, but it’s still not as satisfying as having a clear-cut maincampaign that flows smoothly as you pummel everything in sight. Thisoverabundance of content may also seriously wear down the player. Heck, itcertainly wore me down: when I firstpicked up the game, I was absolutely set on clearing both Hanzo and Hebijo Arcsand reaching 100% completion for all characters. I laugh at my own naivety now:by the time I finished the Hanzo Arc, I was starting to suffer from a seriouscase of gaming fatigue, and I had not managed to reach 100% completion for asingle one of the Hanzo shinobis. (I was three stages away from it with Azuka,though, but kept failing because of another main flaw of the game, which I willexpose right after I’m done with this one.) I tried to soldier on and startedthe Hebijo Arc, but didn’t reach very far, although the story seemedinteresting and just as compelling as the Hanzo Arc one. I was just gettingexhausted and tired of the game, and one day, I put it down for good andstopped playing it entirely—literally from one minute to the next. Now that’s acase of gaming burnout if I ever saw one. Maybe I’m the only SKB player who lent into this, but I’dwager that I’m not. The game is just too enormous not to exhaust most of theplayers who would dare trying to clear it in one go. Of course, maybe that wasa foolish attempt in the first place: SKBis two games combined in one, after all, and common sense would dictate thatone should let some time pass before tackling the second half of the game. Thisdoesn’t change the fact that whether they are taken together or separately,these two games are bursting at the seams and way too gargantuan for their owngood, as well as for the player’s one. Unbalance averted—or is it?In my first post, I praised the sheer equilibrium of the roster and the fact that all theyoung shinobis were so neatly balanced while offering a delightful variety ofhighly functional fighting styles. Well, it’s time to smear that near-perfectpicture a trifle: the fighting styles are all functional indeed, but some aredefinitely less functional than others, which in turn leads the characters thatwield them to be definitely less balanced than others and ruffles theequilibrium of the whole roster ever-so-slightly. Not to the point of breakingthe game, mind you—far from it—but enough to be noticeable and mildly annoyingat times. The Hebijo Arc is the most affected by this slight unbalance, whichis not so surprising: since the Hebijo shinobis are supposed to wield moreunorthodox weapons than the Hanzo shinobis, designing their respective fightingstyles was a bit of a challenge per se, and one that Tamsoft didn’t completelymanage to step up to. While Homura and Hikage are a treat to fight with, the otherthree are a trifle harder to handle. Yomi is uncomfortably slow, Haruka is as stiffas a board and has pitifully inefficient Secret Arts, and Mirai… Well, whoevercame with the idea of letting Mirai wield mostly long-range attacks must havesecretly hated Beat’em Ups. The last thing I want when playing a Beat’em Up isto be forced to retreat constantly in order to have enough room to shoot atenemies. If I wanted to do this, I’d play a shooter, thank you very much. Acouple of long-range attacks are fine, but the bulk of one character’s attacksbeing long-range ones? That’s over the top, and entirely impractical to boot.The Hanzo Arc is not entirely exonerated from unbalanced characters: Daidoji,the extra character unlocked after beating the final boss, is so slow and heavythat it’ll make you want to scream and shake the 3ds. Don’t get me wrong: thisquatuor is still very much playable, but they come across as uncomfortablyclunky compared to the rest of the roster, which is a pity.A much moreserious unbalance lies within the game, and one that can seriously ruin yourfun and prevent you from enjoying the game to the fullest—and I mean thatliterally. See, the reason why I couldn’t clear a single character arc isbecause I kept failing at a couple of missions; and I kept failing at thembecause SKB’s difficulty levelsuffers from a blatant case of unbalance. Some trash mobs use long-rangeattacks that can pretty much drain your life bar in three hits, all the more soif you’re playing in Yin Mode: when you’re pitted against a dozen of thesepests like in some of the harder missions (the ones I kept failing at), thereis very little chance to last more than ten seconds, let alone survive thewhole ordeal. Oh, that is certainly possible after many tries and with a lot ofpractice, but the difficulty level of these missions is seriously uncanny. Tomake matters worse, there is no parry move and very few of the shinobis wieldlong-range attacks themselves, which puts you in a highly vulnerable positionagainst these accursed foes. On the other hand, the boss battles that pit youagainst the shinobis of the opposite clan are disappointingly easy: you canbreathe through them by cornering your opponent and spamming them with hits.They won’t try to escape, and if you hit hard and fast enough, they won’t beable to squeeze an attack either. These shinobis are supposed to be the eliteof their respective schools, and yet they’ll make you sweat considerably less thana bunch of trash mobs with long-range attacks: now that’s what I call unbalanced difficulty. This is both ridiculousand frustrating, and I can only hope that Tamsoft fixed that issue in thesubsequent Senran Kagura instalments.Too much, too littleLast butnot least in that litany of flaws is, well… the fan-service. Now, branding thefan-service as a flaw may seem like a paradox after I spent a couple ofparagraphs explaining how inoffensive, unobtrusive and humorous it was in my last post; and yet, I stand byall of these statements. The problem lies in the dosage of the fan-service: the amount of fan-service present in SKB is such that no matter how you lookat it, there will very likely be either too much or too little of it to satisfyplayers. The “Toomuch” side is a no-brainer: every gamer who loathes fan-service in any way,shape or form will obviously avoid that game at all costs, possibly slanderingit in the process and raging against developers who use dirty tricks to forcetheir games on people. These gamers may miss an excellent Beat’em Up in theprocess, but they will abide by their own moral rules about gaming. Then, youhave the gamers who are mildly disturbed by fan-service: they may buy the gameand play it, but they will do so with a grimace of distaste and will cringeregularly at the sight of the fan-servicy bits, which will make the game anunderwhelming experience in their eyes instead of the blast it could have been. But thereis also the “Too little” side. A gamer who openly bought this game for thefan-service may ultimately be disappointed by how tame the fan-service actuallyis, and may feel that there is not nearly enough of it to satisfy their peepingurges. For every five seconds of risqué bits, you have to trudge through dozensof minutes of demanding fighting, which is hardly conducive to titillation. Theridiculously salacious European box, with its raunchy cover art and dirty innuendosin the game’s description, may be blamed for ramping up expectations way toohigh: anyone who expects a similar level of lewdness in the game is in for ahuge letdown. I never came across any complaints regarding that particularpoint—gamers are usually busy arguing if such a game should have the right toexist in the first place—but I’d wager that some people have been disappointed,even though they were not vocal about it. Heck, even I was nearly disappointed that SKBwas not as lascivious as it promised to be, despite the fact that I don’t careone bit about fan-service in games.This leadsus to a striking conclusion: it's very likely that the gamers who will be the most satisfied and at ease with the fan-service involved in SKB are the gamers who do not careabout fan-service either way. I am one of these, my stance towards fan-servicebeing similar to my stance towards gorgeous graphics: they will never be the mainreason why I purchase a game, but if they don’t hinder the gameplay nor stealresources that should have been allotted to it, then I’m perfectly fine withthem and can even appreciate them if they are to my retina’s liking. And sureenough, I loved SKB and would beready to praise it without the slightest hint of shame. There’s some bitingirony at work here, and that irony colors with sadness when one ponders thatfor all the attention it drew to the game at the time of its release, thiscampy fan-service coating may well taint its legacy on the long run. Risquégames may create an uproar when they land on shelves, but they never reach acult classic status or enter any gaming hall of fame: as time goes on, theybecome a curiosity, something to giggle at, sneer at or shake your head at witha rueful smile, but certainly not something to play, let alone love. Any gamerknows Cluster’s Revenge, but no gamerwould call it a cult classic or even a remotely good game. SKB will probably follow the same path and be remembered only as“this game that let you ogle at female bits in 3D”, without the slightestmention of how excellent a Beat’em Up it is. That’s a pity and a shame, really. However,that will not prevent me from being fond of SenranKagura Burst and replaying it in the future. This is a fantastic Beat’emUp, and if you’re a fan of the genre and can stomach the fan-service, I wouldmost definitely recommend it. I would not recommend it to someone who wants toget loads of fan-service first and foremost, not try to convince anyone whohates fan-service to give it a try for the sake of its other qualities; thereare tons of eroge andfan-service-free Beat’em Ups out there that are bound to satisfy such gamers waybetter than SKB could. I willcertainly take a look at the subsequent entries, all the more so as the Beat’emUp genre is not exactly at its peak these days: an ongoing Beat’em Up serieswith several games under its belt is nothing to be sniffed at, and I can onlyhope that the other Senran games will turn out to be as excellent as Senran Kagura Burst, maybe even steppingas far as correcting their elder’s flaws. Thanks for reading, and be my guestanytime!"},
{"title": "Senran Kagura Burst (1): There’s more than meets the eye", "date": "15/03/2015", "text": "“Meets the eye” is the right expression,indeed. Heck, “tries to pierce it” would be even closer to the truth. Neverbefore had I played a game that tried so actively to perforate my retinas withglorious displays of perky bosoms and bottoms—and I was not even playing withthe 3D on. We’re now tackling Senran Kagura Burst, a game that became famous—and infamous—for allthe wrong reasons. Developed by Tamsoft and released in 2012(jp), 2013(na) and2014(eu) for the Nintendo 3ds, SenranKagura Burst (SKB for short) is actuallya combination of two games, namely SenranKagura: Skirting Shadows and its sequel SenranKagura Burst. Both of these games are classic side-scrolling Beat’em Up àla Streets of Rage featuring avariety of characters with distinctive fighting styles. However, you’d beforgiven for missing that piece of information: from its very inception, the SKB series has been marketed nearlyexclusively as a naughty, kinky game that would let you peek at young women’sample bosoms and behinds through their ripped-off clothing. Since the serieswas kick-started by one developer’s somewhat mundane desire to see femaleanatomy displayed in glorious 3D on the 3ds, such a turn of events shouldn’t betoo surprising. This is a heavy legacy to bear—in more ways than one—but SKB does so with grace and ingenuity andmanages to emerge unscathed from the unsavoury marketing campaign thatsurrounded it. Behind the game’s busty chest beats a heart of gold: SKB is actually an excellent Beat’em Upthat has much more to offer than a couple of risqué shots. There’s more thanmeets the eye, indeed; let’s now explore SKB’soften-overlooked goodness!Theelephant in the roomLet’s be honest: talking about SKB without mentioning the fan-serviceis purely and simply impossible. It’s so blatant and purposeful that you cannotignore it, and every review of SKBunder the gaming sun has commented on it, with tones ranging from ecstatic todisparaging. I might as well do the same—and start with it while I’m at it,since SKB’s fan-service is soin-your-face, basking in the spotlight like an attention-hungry teenager. Or isit?  Well, that was the first pleasant surprise SKB had in store. The fan-service isnowhere near as extreme and/or pervasive as you’d imagine by seeing theEuropean cover art—as a matter of fact, this cover is ten times raunchier thananything you will witness in the game itself. The Shinobi transformations,during which the ladies change from their school uniforms into theirpersonalized Shinobi outfits in order to gain extra strength and speed, reallydon’t show that much flesh. They look like shortened versions of the SailorSenshi transformations with a heavier emphasis on bottoms and bosoms, but itreally doesn’t get more scandalous than that—as a matter of fact, you’llprobably see much more flesh in a SailorMoon episode than in a session of SKB.As for the infamous shredding bits that let you see the ladies’ outfits beingripped into pieces, they are incredibly brief—blink and you’ll miss thementirely—and really don’t show that much flesh either. To make the fan-serviceeven more inoffensive, all these already rather mild and short sequences can beskipped entirely by pressing the Start button, which will probably be a blessingfor everyone at some point: even the most ravenous fan-service aficionado hasto get bored after seeing the same snippets a hundred times. Furthermore, the game turns out to besurprisingly conservative in some ways. The story-telling segments are unexpectedlysober and subdued: instead of ramping up the fan-service and drowning theplayer under tons of risqué close-ups as one would have expected, the gamefavours a more dignified approach by displaying long lines of text overpictures of various empty sceneries. Kinky jokes and innuendos are very few andfar between, and the couple of shots of the young ladies that appear during thestoryline segments are really quite tame. Even the stripping mechanics are notthat risqué when one ponders it, and it boils down to a simple reason: theladies wear swimsuits as underwear instead of lingerie. While swimsuits don’tcover much more than lingerie and still have some kind of erotic charge(especially in Japan), they are still ten times less suggestive than youraverage lingerie. Having the ladies don swimsuits seriously defuses theeroticism of the stripping sequences and makes them feel more like pool tripantics than like raunchy peeping sessions. Last but not least is the fan-service’ssaving grace, which is none other than the delicious irony that pervades it. SKB’ s brand of fan-service isself-aware and self-derisive: the developers joyously take the piss out oftheir own fan-service obsession—and the player’s one as well—by insertingtongue-in-cheek jokes and puns about their own design choices. The fact that the young ladieswear swimsuits also has a ring of irony to it: it’s nearly like the charactersare being aware that they are going to be peeped at and donned swimsuits inorder to be prepared for it, taking the piss out of the player in the process. And let’s noteven mention the relaxed and  playful atmospherecreated by the all-female setting, which has the girls bantering joyfully,acting in ways that could definitely be considered un-sexy, not caring in theslightest about having their body parts exposed and being friendly andsupportive towards one another instead of worrying about their looks and vyingfor male attention like in your average harem RPG. Oh, and there is also thehidden irony at works behind the ripping mechanics: having your clothes rippedinto pieces may be serious eye candy, but it’s not a good thing as far as gameplay is concerned, since it meansthat you’re heading closer to defeat; and the better you become at playing SKB, the less shredding—and flesh— youwill see. It doesn’t get any more ironic than that, really. So indeed, there is some fan-service atwork in SKB; however, it representsonly a small fraction of the whole game, and that fraction definitely morecomes across as more campy than salacious. Most importantly, it doesn’tdesecrate the ladies; and that makes complete sense, since you actually play asthem. No gamer can enjoy to see thevery character(s) they incarnate being routinely mistreated and humiliated, andTamsoft understood that perfectly. More than that, they actually went to greatlengths to flesh out the young ladies and turn them into interesting charactersthat the player can care for as well as relate to. Without further ado, let’ssee how this was done!Fleshedinside outThere is no doubt that the ladies weregenerously fleshed out as far as their measurements were concerned; however,their personalities were not forgotten and have been given as much care andlove as their body lines, if not more. On the narrative side, each of the youngdames was granted her own private backstory, as well as a personalized endingthat can be uncovered when meeting certain conditions (namely clearing everysingle mission in Yin Mode, which is easier said than done). Thosebackstories are both interesting and touching and give a great incentive torelate to the ladies; they may be young, but their struggles andresponsibilities are heavy ones indeed. Their personalities are equallyclear-cut and distinctive; and while said personalities are a little bit on thecliché side (the inexpressive and nearly mute girl, the ever-smiling clumsyone, the dignified one with a serene look and so on), they remain endearing andcompelling. It is a real pleasure to discover the ladies as you play the game,and caring for them as well as relating to them comes  as naturally as delivering blows (more onthat later, he he). This commendable attempt at crafting deepand moving characters is conveniently consolidated by subtle yet effective features.The voice acting is the most blatant one: it is amazingly good and fits theladies’ personality like a glove, and is a pure pleasure to listen to—and this iscoming from a person who usually hates voice acting in videogames. Another elementthat may take more time to sink in is the fact that each girl is granted herown individual musical themes during the fighting sessions, both in Normal andFrantic Modes; and amazingly enough, these themes manage to fit theirpersonalities just as well as the voice acting—and they are pure ear-candy toboot. The fact that this crew of young dames isas nicely fleshed out outside of battle is already pleasant enough, but thereis even better in store. This is a Beat’em Up after all, and Beat’em Ups are typicallythe kind of games in which characters’ personalities should shine first andforemost on the fighting field, in the heart of some red-hot action. Andfortunately, SKB gloriously deliversin this department and doesn’t disappoint one bit. The ladies’ respectivefighting styles are as distinct as they could be while remaining totallyfunctional (or nearly so—more on that later). Each girl has her own moves,special attacks and weapon, and they are all neatly polished and carefullybalanced. Granted, some of the ladies are a teeny-weeny bit stronger and some ateeny-weeny bit weaker than the rest of the crew, but the differences are keptto a minimum and don’t hamper the gameplay nor drag the game down in any way.At any rate, it’s an absolute pleasure to try your hand at so many differentfighting styles, and getting to know and master each girl’s distinctive way ofkicking butts certainly goes a long way in establishing them as rock-solidcharacters. And that’s quite a good thing, since kicking butts is, after all,the primary point of the game.Thename of the gameIndeed, it may seem a bit pathetic to coverall things fighting only at the end of that post, knowing that SKB is first and foremost a Beat’em Up;but it was hard to proceed otherwise. I’m following an agenda set by the gameitself, willingly or not; and since SKBclamoured for attention in the most unsavoury way by aiming straight at theplayer’s groin, I first had to dismiss the idea that this game is just a loadof fan-service crap. Now that the deed is done, we can pore over the heart ofthe game, namely the butt-kicking. And boy, is it good. A Beat’em Up lives and dies by its physics,and SKB’s physics are absolutelybrilliant. The control over your character is total, with no trace of thesketchiness or wobbliness that plagues games such as Code of Princess, and foes have a kind of pleasant density that makes the fightingincredibly fulfilling—you can really feelyourself punching them, so to speak, and it’s quite the guilty pleasure. Theaction is fast-paced and nervous, and combat is very much aerial-based: themost devastating combos are performed in the air and a couple of aerial attacksare available, as well as a double jump which is an absolute blessing and canbe a life-saver at time, especially when combined with the aforementionedaerial attacks. And there is adedicated jumping button to boot, saving you the trouble of having to fumblewith the analog stick. Talking about buttons, it’s worthmentioning that SKB keeps things assimple as possible in that department and spares the player a lot ofbutton-mashing. You never need to press more than two buttons at a time toperform any action, and the combos are based solely on various combinations ofthe X and Y buttons—displayed at all times on the touch screen for yourconvenience. SKB is as close to asbeginner’s Beat’em Up as it gets, while remaining deeply fulfilling thanks tothe sheer variety of moves that you can execute—a variety made even wider bythe size of the roster. Said roster, and the array of fightingstyles that comes with it, is most definitely another highlight of SKB. Each of the shinobis offers her owninterpretation of the fighting system, prompting you to adapt your way ofplaying accordingly. This is obviously a staple of the genre, but SKB pulls it out better than mostBeat’em Ups. Each girl is obviously endowed with her own exclusive combinationof speed, strength and endurance as well as granted her own private combos—thiswas already the rule in Streets of Rage,and it’s still valid today. SKB thenpushes the envelope a tad further by allotting different ranges and areas ofeffect to each lady’s Secret Arts (i.e. powerful special attacks), and pushesit even further by giving the same treatment to their regular attacks. Thiscould have ended up as a giant mess of unbalanced characters, had things notbeen handled admirably well; what you get instead is a lively, vibrant andmultifaceted fighting system that can nearly give you the feeling that you’re playinga different game every time you switch characters—expect that you’re not, soyou still have the benefit of fully mastering the game’s commands. Thisobviously gives SKB a huge amount of replay value; as a matterof fact, I’ve been playing the game for a good twenty hours and still didn’tfully explore all the variations of the fighting style embodied by the ladies. When all is said and done, and when onelooks beyond the campy fan-service coating, SenranKagura Burst is a gloriously good game. It’s a fun, lively and exuberantBeat’em Up that offers a rock-solid and exhilarating fighting experience, aswell interesting characters that are highly loveable and relatable and a touchingstoryline. The wealth of content packed by SKBis truly staggering: there are so many different modes, stages and fightersthat you can rest assured that your initial investment in the game will berecouped several times over. The amount of content is actually so enormous thatit borders on being overwhelming, leaving the player queasy and with thefeeling that there is way much more than they can chew and that they will neversee the end of it. I’d like to elaborate on that point, as well as on the otherflaws of Senran Kagura Burst;however, this post itself is on the verge of becoming overwhelmingly huge andindigestible, so these matters will have to wait for my next post, which willbe dedicated to the less glorious aspects of the game. Thanks for reading, andbe my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Hexyz Force: Brilliant in its own modest way (2)", "date": "08/03/2015", "text": "Here we are, back for the second part of mypraise of Hexyz Force’s placid brandof goodness. It is now time to expand on what I consider to be the game’s moststellar quality—a quality that is not so often encountered in the realm ofJ-RPGs. This quality, ladies and gentlemen, is a deep connection between thenarrative and the gameplay, in which the two reinforce each other rather thansap each other. This is easier said than done, as proven by numerous J-RPGs:the most infamous example is undoubtedly FinalFantasy VII, with its Phoenix Downs that mysteriously lose their power asfar as Aerith is concerned. A harmonious correlation between gameplay andnarrative is hard to craft, indeed; but Sting managed to perform the deed in Hexyz Force, and quite brilliantly atthat. Let’s now explore how this rare and most precious quality unfolds in thatgame. Forceruns the gameIndeed, the name says it all: the presenceof the word “force” in the title is no mere coincidence, as the thing plays ahuge part in both the storyline and the gameplay. The game’s special brand offorce borrows more from Einstein than from Star Wars and is surprisinglywell-crafted and consistent, both on the narrative and the game mechanics front. Narrative-wise, Force (indefinite, as mentioned in the game) is apowerful energy that infuses all things. It sometimes flows directly out of theground like your average spring, but most of it lies within living beings andobjects. It can be harnessed and used by beings known as Hexyz, hence the titleof the game. As for what Hexyz areexactly, I won’t enter details in order to keep the game unspoiled; suffice itto say that our heroes belong to that category and can thus tinker with Force.Now, this is all very classic, Star-Warsy fare; however, the game adds a touchof complexity by throwing a zest of special relativity into the mix. To put itsimply, Force and matter are two sides of the same coin: living beings can beconverted into Force, and Force can be injected into objects and living beingsto modify them at will. Such operations are the turf of Hexyz only—which isprobably a good thing, given the kind of messy, bloody actions that theyentail.This leads us to the gameplay variable ofthe equation, and the examination of how these metaphysics translate intogameplay mechanics. Well, it’s fair to say that the said translation isseamless and that very little is lost in it. As Hexyz, our heroes have accessto a pool of Force that is theirs to use only; and using it is highlyrecommended, since it is the only way to perform a number of classic RPG deedsthat go as such:—Healing: There is not the slightest traceof a good ol’ Inn in the game world, nor is there any kind of dedicated healingitem that will cure you in the blink of an eye. Instead of resorting to theseclassic healing methods, you have to use your pool of Force in order to recoveryour HP. Doing so won’t refill your MP, though; if you aim for a full recovery,you have to bathe your hands into one of the “Force Sites” present all aroundthe game world. These are ever-flowing fountains of Force that can be used andabused at will and often go along with a conveniently placed Save Point. —Upgrading your equipment: Once again, yourclassic weapon and armour shops are nowhere to be found in the world of Hexyz Force; if you want to upgrade yourgear and weapons, you have to resort to your own private pool of Force, coupledwith whatever items you harvest through the game world. The characters’ mainweapons, the so-called Ragnafacts, can be upgraded in various ways by injectingForce into them: you can increase their base strength, lower their MPconsumption and, last but not least, acquire a decent range of useful SpecialSkills ranging from healing spells to multi-targeting attacks, withoutforgetting good ol’ buffs. New weapons can also be created through a Fusionprocess, by putting together a couple of items or base materials and injectingForce into them; however, these Fusion-born weapons have a limited number ofuses and cannot endure forever. Fusion is also the sole way to craft new andmore powerful equipment, from shoes to cloaks to magic trinkets with a myriadof effects. It is worth noting that you don’t need to ransack libraries or anyother place to find Fusion recipes: the said recipes become available as soonas you have at least one of the ‘ingredients’ in your inventory. How convenientis that? —Miscellaneous uses: Your characters cangenerate a “Force Scan” that allows you to locate special places known as“Harvest Points”: as the name implies, these are selected spots that harbourinteresting items and replenish regularly. (They can be plundered again afterfighting a couple of random battles, if I remember correctly.) These points canalso be discovered without using Force Scan if you stand very close to them,but the conveniently wider range of the Force Scan spares you the chore ofpoking your nose in every nook and cranny. Your pool of Force can also be usedto inject Force in various places, from trees to unreadable tablets, in orderto progress through the game (rarely) or clear sidequests (most of the time). When it comes to the harnessing side ofForce, things are pretty simple and unfussy. There are two convenient ways tofill in your pool of Force:—Random battles: As you slaughter monsterson the field, their bodies are converted into Force that is added to your pool.This is a great incentive to engage in random battles in the first place andprovides a welcome justification to the necessity of butchering everything insight. —Item conversion: All the items dropped bymonsters, as well as the one you collect through the game world, can beconverted into Force. This is a clever and convenient way to recycle anyunnecessary item, allowing you to clear up your inventory while reapingbenefits—two birds with one stone, indeed. And given how cluttered theinventory can become at times due to the overabundance of monster drops andHarvest Points, this option is an absolute blessing. It is ten times moresatisfying than simply throwing away any unwanted item—heck, it’s even moresatisfying than selling them, knowing the many excellent uses of Force in thatgame. So, you get the picture: Hexyz Force’s brand of Force is both acompelling storyline concept and a stunningly well-honed ensemble of gameplaymechanics, reinforcing each other in a pleasant display of cohesion andcoherence. This is only the second Sting game that I’ve played, and the first, Riviera, also displayed a rock-solidcontinuity between gameplay and narrative—albeit translated and implemented ina different way. I’m starting to think that Sting masters the art ofharmoniously linking together this often restive duo, but it will take a coupleof extra Sting games to confirm that hunch. And if this is indeed the case,then I predict that Sting will become one of my favourite developers of alltime. Theunpolished side of the forceHexyzForce’s harmonious connection between the narrativeand the gameplay may not be ground-breaking, but it is undeniably well honedand deeply fulfilling; added to the rest of the game’s serene goodness, itcreates a beautiful gem of a game—not the most sparkling gem ever, granted, buta gem nonetheless. However, there are a couple of smudges that somewhat tarnishthe smoothly polished surface of that gem and prevent it from reaching a cultclassic status; I think it is worth mentioning them, if only to prevent somedisappointment after I raved about how excellent Hexyz Force was. I didlove that game to pieces, but some points really rubbed me the wrong way, andhere they are in all their annoying glory: —Clocking at roughly 20 hours each, thegame’s two routes are a trifle too long for my taste. It may seem like I’m nit-pickingand being ungrateful: more content must be a good thing, right? Well, not somuch in Hexyz Force. I played Cecilia’s Tale first, and the last five hours felt atad diluted and uneventful compared to everything that unfolded before. On topof that, there is quite a lot of backtracking involved, which definitely leadsone to assume that the routes have been forcefully stretched in order to meet thecurrent expectations regarding RPG longevity. I cannot say for sure if the lastquarter of Levant’s Tale went through the same type of artificial lengtheningsince I didn’t play it, but I wouldn’t be too surprised if it were the case.And talking about this, the reason why I did not play Levant’s Tale afterclearing Cecilia’s one is precisely the excessive length of the routes: I wasinitially planning to clear the whole game in one setting, but I gave up on Levant’sTales after a couple of hours because I had already gotten more than my fill ofthe game. I firmly think that a game that includes several routes should keepsaid routes short enough not to bore the player: a length of 10 to 15 hours perroute is more than enough, especially if the game includes several differentendings and an extra Hard Mode like HexyzForce does. —The ending of Cecilia’s Tale TROLLS youbig time. Jeez, I’m still fuming about it. (SPOILERS ahead, as you’d expect.) This ending starts all nice andwell, with short yet explanatory scenes surveying all the characters’ endeavourssince the eradication of the final boss. And then comes the abomination, thesupreme insult to everybody who took a liking for Cecilia and Rafael: in thelast seconds of the ending, the young man rushes to Cecilia to confess thatthing that has been on his chest for so long and that we all know about. Andinstead of letting us enjoy that sweet long-awaited moment, the camera slowlytravels backwards before the screen fades to black. Wait, what? That’s right: we don’t get to know Rafael’s words, nor are weallowed to see Cecilia’s reaction—let alone the outcome of the whole scene. Seriously,game? After having rooted for these two for so long, it feels like a massiveslap in the face to see things end like that.I know I praised the sobriety of Cecilia’s and Rafael budding love in my first post, but this is a trifle too sober,even for me. Of course, this may havebeen intended as a cliffhanger ending that would have paved the way for asecond instalment; this explanation is all the more believable as the neutralending also ends on a cliffhanger note, leaving many questions unanswered.However, this is frustrating all the same—especially since this hypotheticalsecond instalment has not yet seen the light of day. —The final boss fight is way too difficult,creating a nasty difficulty spike that is definitely unwelcome—especially afterthe couple of uneventful hours that precede it. The problem is not so much thatthis final boss is hard to defeat per se:this is actually a classic example of RPG epic showdown, with metamorphosis ofthe boss at the halfway mark and occasional party-wiping attacks—you know thedrill. No, the problem is rather that this final fight clashes vividly with the rest ofthe boss battles by being significantly more exigent. It requires a good amountof strategy, which is a brand-new thing at that point in the game: instead ofpummelling the boss senselessly until it dies like in all the other boss battles, you now have to think and to chooseyour actions carefully. The Hexyz Charge, which up until then was anonessential option, is now a central element and must be carefully monitoredif you don’t want your party to be slaughtered: the boss’ attacks changedepending on which aspect your party members unleash, his most devastatingattack being triggered by the use of Cerulean Flame. To change the battletemplate at the very end of the game is infuriating and frustrating: why wouldI suddenly start checking the Hexyz Charge meter when I hardly ever looked atit during the whole game? I had also grown seriously lazy after having beenpampered by the comfortable easiness of the game, and the sudden need tostrategize my every move felt like an enormous effort—so much so that I nearlyconsidered giving up on the game at that point. It certainly didn’t help that thisfinal fight is preceded by a long cutscene that cannot be skipped and must beendured again after every failed attempt. —A couple of other points bothered me, suchas the absence of an instant save system (fortunately compensated by theabundance of Save Points) or the lack of a dedicated Axel route, despite thefact that it would have made perfect sense. (I won’t spoil the reasons forthat, but people who have played the game will sure know why I’m saying that.)However, those were really minor quips that can hardly be counted as flaws. All in all, I unequivocally loved Hexyz Force and deeply enjoyed my run ofit. I don’t regret having paid such a hefty price for it: it was worth everydime—and more. I will most certainly play that game again, especially since Istill have to clear Levant’s Tale—which hopefully won’t end on a nasty bigtroll of a cliffhanger. Now, dearest Sting, I would really love to see a sequel to HexyzForce grace the Vita. It’s probablytoo much to ask—but then again, how knows? Some pretty obscure games getsequels on a regular basis, so why not this one? At least, I’ll keep pining forit and hoping for a miracle to happen. And even if a sequel never comes to life,Hexyz Force is still there to beenjoyed, and I’ll certainly indulge in it again in the future. Thanks forreading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Hexyz Force: Brilliant in its own modest way (1)", "date": "28/02/2015", "text": "Since I purchased my PSP a couple of yearsago, I appointed myself the pleasant mission of tracking down and purchasingevery RPG available for the system. I can honestly say that I’ve performed well,since a good 95% of all PSP RPGs are now part of my precious collection.However, some games persistently slipped under the radar because of theirrarity and collateral high prices. HexyzForce is one of them, or used to be: I had had an eye on that game for afairly long time before I finally managed to get my hands on a copy. The saidcopy cost me the hefty price of $60, which was still one of the cheapest pricesthat I’ve encountered for a full copy of that game. Understandably, I had very high hopes for Hexyz Force. However, I was also acutely aware that my hopes couldultimately be crushed: current games may be expensive because they areexcellent and/or popular, but older games are primarily expensive because oftheir rarity, without any guarantee of collateral goodness. Fortunately, I wasnot to be disappointed this time: I totally loved Hexyz Force. It may not be an instant cult classic, but it is asurprisingly excellent game in its own quiet, subdued way. Let’s have a bit of data before I expand onthat game’s tranquil goodness. Developed by Sting and released in 2009(jp) and2010(na) for the PSP, Hexyz Forcebecame a rarity in the West nearly as soon as appeared there. It avoided Europeentirely for no good reason and North-America was not exactly flooded withcopies, which led to the current scarcity of the game. Sealed copies can sellfor as much as $200; as for my own copy, it is obviously a second-hand one,albeit complete and in mint condition. At any rate, the lack of Westerndistribution of that game is a trifle puzzling: Hexyz Force is by no means a niche game, but rather astraightforward J-RPG that could definitely have found an eager audience inEurope. Atlus’ ways are sometimes unfathomable, indeed. That being said, let’snow move on to meatier topics and explore that game’s goodness! QuietlyexcellentHexyzForce may appear as a fairly classic J-RPG at firstsight, with its turn-based combat, cookie-cutter characters and vanilla storyinvolving the tracking of mysterious artefacts in order to prevent an upcomingapocalypse in a world where races wage war on one another. However, there isdefinitely more than meets the eye in all these departments, and the gamereveals some unexpected originality under its apparent layer of RPG classicism;on top of that, and to make things even better, it boasts a rare and unmistakablequality that I would love to encounter more often in RPGs—but more on thatlater. For now, let’s concentrate on the otherspieces of goodness, starting with the characters. They are cliché, that much is undeniable: from the strong-headed yetslightly clueless young lady to the brave and loyal knight striving for peace,without forgetting the expressionless Elf, the touchy princess and the lad wholooks like a teenager but is actually several centuries old, everyone fits aJ-RPG/anime trope in the book. However, Sting didn’t dive too deep in clichéterritory and kept the trope factor to a minimum, preferring instead to expandthe characters’ personalities through well-crafted dialogues and revelatorycutscenes. As a result, the whole crew comes across as lively and vibrant, andvery much loveable. I developed an instant liking for my party and really caredfor them deeply, and their ever-so-slight banality didn’t bother me one bit. Thereis a zesty tang of humour in their interactions, as well as a soft romanceelement that is handled in a pleasantly sober way (spoilers): Levant and Irene’s established relationship iscomforting and heart-warming, and Cecilia and Rafael’s shy and gentleburgeoning love will make the heart of even the most hardened gamer flutterwith sweet anticipation. (End of spoiler) The storyline follows the same pattern: itis not particularly original content-wise and does not pack any soul-shatteringplot twist or heart-wrenching revelations, but it is told in a very convincingand well-crafted way that makes you care for what happens next. To make thingseven more interesting, it unfolds through two different routes, which you bothhave to play in order to get the full picture story-wise. This could be a caseof fake longevity, if not for the fact that the two halves of the story remainperfectly understandable per se; playing the other half only refines thenarrative and adds interesting details to the already known storyline. This ismore of a case of two different teams of characters aiming for the same goal,whose respective paths meet occasionally and finally converge towards the endof the game. As a matter of fact, your final party comprises all the playablecharacters of the game, which gives you the pleasant—and ratherrare—opportunity to tailor-make your party for the last boss fight—providingthat you are ready for a bit of grinding in case you choose characters thatwere not in your party up until then. Let’s now explore the battle system, whichis truly one of the highlights of HexyzForce. It is fast-paced and dynamic, and can be even more so with the useof the fast-forwarding R button. (This option is truly a blessing, and I wishall RPGs could offer it.) This battle system is pleasantly easy to master yetoffers some welcome depth thanks to a system of complementarity between thethree attributes that infuse the various weapons of the characters. Add to thisa handful of conveniently devastating special attacks that can be unleashedafter you fill a special gauge and you get a fighting system that is classicyet incredibly smooth and efficient. To make things better, enemies are visibleon screen and can be avoided providing that you run fast enough. However, it isnot recommended to run away from encounters: Hexyz Force is one of these streamlined games in which fighting allthe enemies you encounter will grant you enough XP to tackle all the challengesthat come your way. In other words, no extra grinding is needed in thatgame—except if you change the composition of your party at the last minute, asI mentioned earlier. Last but not least in this goodness recitalis the general user-friendliness of HexyzForce. Here is a game that seems dedicated to make your life—and yourgaming—easier through the implementation of a series of clever features thatare not so often encountered in classic J-RPGs. One of them is thefast-forwarding button that I mentioned above, but there is more:—A map of the current area is displayed atall times in the upper right corner of the screen. Not only does it spare youthe annoyance of losing your time exploring dead ends, but it also convenientlyshows chests, enemies, save points and “Force Sites” where you can restore yourHP and MP (more on that later). What more could you ask for?—The world map allows you to travel at willbetween places in an instantaneous way. You don’t need to cross paths filled with monsters or to use impracticaltravel means to rally a given spot, which is incredibly neat. On top of that,once a place is discovered, it can be accessed at all times: no patronizing onthe game’s part by preventing you from returning somewhere on the basis thatthe storyline doesn’t justify it. Now thatis how I want my RPG to be. Freedom is mine!—HexyzForce has one of the best sidequest implementations that I’ve everencountered in a J-RPG. For one thing, the sidequests are as unobtrusive asthey can be, while immediately identifiable as such; there is virtually no riskof mistaking a sidequest for an essential plot point in that game. For another,they can be cleared at all times, all the more so as all locations can beaccessed easily; there is no such thing as a ridiculously narrow time frame toclear a sidequest, which is an absolute blessing. They are also pleasantlylogical, and it doesn’t take any twisted thinking or exhaustive FAQs to figureout the right course of action. Last but not least, the game offers a quest logthat details all the sidequests you unlocked. What’s not to love, seriously? Here ends my first survey of Hexyz Force’s placid goodness. I stillhave a lot to say, actually; but I am currently trying to make my posts a tadless stuffy, which means that I will take a break for the time being. My second post will cover what I consider to be HexyzForce’s greatest quality, as well as the couple of minor flaws that Ispotted during my run. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Coveted Games: Flying under the radar", "date": "25/02/2015", "text": "I know that I've already written awishlist for early 2015; however, some potentially interesting games managed toescape my sharp and ever-scanning eye. In addition, I have reconsidered myposition about a certain high-profile title, which I disdained until now butmay well be inclined to buy after all. Without further ado, let’s diveinto the second part of my early 2015 wishlist!—HyperdimensionNeptunia U: Action Unleashed (Vita): There is no shortage of Hyperdimension Neptunia games on the Vita these days, and this title adds anotherentry to an already long list. It seems to pack lots of Hack and Slash goodnessà la Dynasty Warriors, complete witha hefty amount of cuteness and an ever-so-slight dose of fan-service for goodmeasure. I love to indulge in a good Hack and Slash every once in a while,which makes this game highly desirable; however, I am no gamer to be fooled bycutesy sprites and fan-service, and this game will be allowed a place in myprecious collection only if its physics are rock-solid. —Toukiden:Kiwami (Vita): The sequel to Toukiden:The Age of Demons, as the title abundantly implies. It packs newcharacters, new locations and a new story, and just like the first game, thetrailer alone was enough to get me all hyped up about this game. Charismaticcharacters, great voice acting, gorgeous overall aesthetics, what more can youask for? Well, great physics would be one thing, as well as camera moves thatdon’t make me vomit my lunch. I want this game, granted, but I will definitelycheck these two points carefully before I purchase Kiwami. —Oreshika2: Tainted Bloodlines (Vita): This is the sequel to Ore no Shikabane wo Koete Yuke (Oreshikafor short), a PSP remake of a Playstation game released only in Japan. Oreshika 2 mixes gorgeous stylised art,dungeon crawling and breeding mechanics and promises to be a smash hit—at least,I’m certainly looking forward to it. There seems to be some controversy about acertain character stealing your own family’s thunder almost constantly and defacto becoming the main focus of the game, but let’s be honest: as long as itdoesn’t alter the gameplay in significant ways, I really don’t have anobjection. Gaming hours are too short and precious to rant about ego issues. —Hatsune Miku: Project Mirai DX (3ds): Idon’t think I need to present HastuneMiku, the series that propelled a modest user interface to the coveted rankof gaming icon. Weirder things have happened in the world of gaming, but notmany. At any rate, this is yet another iteration of the successful rhythm gamefranchise, and its inclusion in this list has more to do with curiosity thanwith fandom. I’ve never played a HatsuneMiku game, and I’m not even sure such games are right for me; but I’d liketo see for myself what the fuss is all about. This 3ds entry seems to be a goodstarting point, with its bright colours and cute chibi sprites; I have to admit that Hastune Miku: Project Diva Fon the Vita look a trifle too much like a copy-paste of The Voice or American Idolfor my comfort. I want to play a videogame, not some kind of real-TV rip-off. —The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask 3D (3ds):Last but not least, here is the high-profile game that had be all riled up andfuming about remakes and ports stealing the limelight from brand-new games—aswell as precious development resources. You’ll notice that I used the pasttense: while I’m still annoyed that a mere remake should be celebrated with suchfervour, I’m not as fervently opposed to the idea of purchasing that game as Iused to be, and there is a crystal-clear reason for that change of heart. Beyondthe laziness inherent to the act of remaking/porting and the ridiculous hypeelicited by that port stands a truth that cannot be denied: Majora’s Mask is a brand-new game as faras I’m concerned. I never played it, and the only footage of it I’ve ever seenwas the one used in the “Ben Drowned” creepypasta. I may have my opinions aboutremaking and porting, but I’m first and foremost a gamer in search of newgaming experiences, and Majora’s Maskis exactly that. I have to admit that the available footage from the 3ds remakecaught my eye: sure, the overall blocky aesthetic hurts my retinas and remindsme why I retreated into retro gaming back in the late ’90s, but the sicklypurple hue that seems to seep through every polygon is definitely enticing tomy colour-hungry eyes. And it’s Zelda,after all. Heck, for all I know, Majora’sMask may become the next entry in my Cult Classic list.On thehardware side, February saw the Western release of the much-anticipated NewNintendo 3ds. Or is it, indeed? It’s hard to get a reliable feel of the hypesurrounding the system; and for every gamer shedding tears of joy and ready tospend hundreds of whatever currency to get a limited edition of the beast,there seems to be a gamer grumbling that Nintendo releases way too manyiterations of its handhelds. I stand somewhere in the middle, waving hesitantlybetween both sides. When the MonsterHunter 4 limited edition of the New 3ds became available in January, thebeauty of that piece of kit caught my eye in such a way that I pre-ordered itinstantly. However, I cancelled my pre-order the very day of the actual release,before the console was sent to me. I felt a trifle stupid for caving in to mycollector’s instincts so readily and without pondering the matter. And afterhaving done so, it turns out that I don’t really need to get a New 3ds rightaway, especially one packing MonsterHunter 4: I still have to check if I can tolerate the type of 3D used bythat game, and there are not nearly enough exclusive New 3ds titles in thepipeline to justify a day one purchase. I will most certainly purchase a New3ds sooner or later, if only to use as a back-up system; however, I willprobably go for the regular model with interchangeable face plates rather thanfor the XL one. There will probably be more limited editions includinginteresting games, so it’s really just a matter of being patient and waitingfor the right combination. And the infamous Majora’sMask Limited edition, you may ask? Well, I didn’t even consider thisoption. Apart from the fact that it was virtually impossible to find, I wasreally not fond of the garish golden colour donned by the system. I wouldprobably have canceled my pre-order as well anyway, so that settles the matter. That’s allfor the second part of my Early 2015 Wishlist. More Vita games, morediscoveries, the months to come look bright indeed! And of course, you’re morethan welcome to share your own coveted games in the comment section.

{"title": "Sorcery Saga (2): Tips and tricks for a smooth roam", "date": "21/02/2015", "text": "Here weare, back for my second post about Sorcery Saga. This post will be all tips and tricks, and I was not planning towrite about such a matter at first; however, reading reviews about the gamepromptly convinced me that it wouldn't be such a bad idea after all. I wasquite surprised to come across numerous reviews complaining that Sorcery Saga was too difficult overalland mourning the fact that you lose your equipment every time you die in adungeon. Such complaints denoted not only a lack of awareness of the generalgameplay mechanics of roguelikes, but also a lack of awareness of the gameplaymechanics of that particularroguelike. For, like I hinted in my first post, it is perfectly possible tohold onto your equipment in Sorcery Saga,and quite easily at that. Without further ado, let’s see how this can be done!Kuu is the keyThe key to success, that is. Despite itsmodest looks, Kuu is much more than a mere pet tagging along: the littlecreature can basically make the difference between a smooth and a rocky run of Sorcery Saga. Yes, that’s how tremendouslyimportant Kuu is. The little chap has many virtues that can come in handy; butfor now, let’s concentrate on its most stellar one, which—you guessed it—isnone other than being the safekeeper of your precious equipment.Here’s how things work in practice. Thedungeon crawling comes to an end as soon as Pupuru is taken down, regardless ofwhether Kuu is still standing or not; you are then sent back to townempty-handed, in classic roguelike fashion. However, there is a twist to thesemechanics: if Kuu is indeed stillconscious when Pupuru faints from enemies’ blows, he will take your equipmentback to town for you, where it can be donned and used again right away. Thisworks at all times, regardless of whether your equipment is tagged with an IDScroll or not, and this is basically the supreme trick to progress smoothly in Sorcery Saga. From what I’ve read, most Sorcery Saga players seem to be unawarethat Kuu can save your equipment—and the day—in such a way. And this is not sosurprising given the nature of the gameplay mechanics involved: since Kuu canlose consciousness without ending the roaming and be reanimated at all timeswith all sorts of items, it can be really tempting to use the little chap as aconvenient shield and let him take blows instead of Pupuru. However, by avertiginous and highly ironic twist of gameplay mechanics, the safest way toplay is actually the other way around.If anything, Pupuru herself should beused as a shield for Kuu when the going gets tough in order to ensure that allthe hard work you put into upgrading of your equipment will not be lost whendefeat strikes. And don’t even think of letting Kuu starve in order to spareitems: the fuller the ever-hungry creature is, the further you are from losingyour equipment at defeat’s doors. “Keep Kuu full at all times” should be acardinal rule in Sorcery Saga,indeed: as long as the little chap has a shred of satiety in him, yourequipment is as safe as it were tucked away in your room.Remember this and act accordingly, and losing your finely honed equipmentshould be only a distant nightmare. For the record, I didn’t lose my sword andshield a single time through the whole game despite dying a good number oftimes, sometimes in entirely stupid ways. (The most stupid death was probablywhen I pressed the wrong button and accidentally lashed my sword at a DungeonMerchant instead of paying him, after which he head-butted me to death. But Idigress.) I remember once being cornered in a Monster House with no HealingItems or Spells and no Transport Book, and monsters so numerous around us thatit was pretty obvious that we were headed for a defeat. Instead of flailingabout and delivering useless blows, I used my last turns to throw items at Kuuin order to keep him alive and well; and when the last blow fell on Pupuru, thedeed was done and the conveniently sated Kuu dutifully brought my preciousequipment back to town. Overall, Pupuru and Kuu are really twosides of the same coin: you cannot separate them and treat Kuu as a convenientextra shield. This is actually a very interesting and rather original gameplayfeature: allies controlled by the CPU are usually mere commodities that can beused at will with no dire consequences, but not so in that game. Kuu is morethan a useful ally or even a part of your team: he is actually you, although this may not be obvious atfirst sight. You incarnate Kuu as much as Pupuru in Sorcery Saga, and taking them both equally into account is the keyto smooth progression. Extratreats for the roadTo complete the exposition of this veryimportant gameplay mechanic, here are a couple of tips that should definitelyprove handy and make your dungeon-crawling easier. Enjoy those yummy sidedishes!—Cursed items have no effect whatsoever onKuu and will fill him all the same, so don’t hesitate to feed him any curseditem that you don’t want to hold onto.—If your attempt at cooking curry fails andproduces an inedible plate of curry, do not despair! Cursed Curry, as it iscalled, can be thrown at enemies to paralyse them. Incredibly handy during bossfights, as you’d expect.—As a whole, all cursed items can dealvarious amounts of damage to enemies, so don’t hesitate to experiment with suchitems. I once disposed of a boss solely by throwing a cursed item at him; thething dealt 300 points of damage, and the boss instantly became history. Toobad I cannot remember what this amazing item was. Oh, well. —The game rewards the continuous use ofweapons and shields in the most pleasant way: as you cleave your way throughdungeons while relying faithfully on the same equipment, said equipment willsomehow level up. Not only will it become stronger, but special slots will alsobecome available: these slots are visible in the item’s description and canaccommodate a variety of so-called Seals with awesome effects, from protection against thievery to stats bonuses, without forgetting the good ol' elemental immunities—and many, many more. To help you make your choice, an exhaustive list of all Seals and their effects is available in town at the Library. Each piece ofgear can hold up to five Seals and some of these Seals can really turn thetables, so stick to your weapon and shield!—The fusion process has some limitationsbut can still be played to your advantage. There are two types of weaponsavailable, namely Swords and Staves. If you decide to a fuse together, say, aSword +5 and a Staff +2, you will obtain neither a Sword +7 nor a Staff +7, asextra points/ranks can only be transferred between similar weapons. Classic,shall we say. However, if you fuse togethera Sword with an X Seal and a Staff with a Y Seal, you will indeed obtain eithera Sword or a Staff with both Seals—providing that the base weapon holds enoughempty slots, of course. This is a neat trick to obtain the Seals you want moreeasily and it should be used and abused without the slightest hint of shame,especially since some of the Seals are pretty rare. This addendum dedicated solely to tips andtricks is now coming to an end, and I hope that its content will prove usefulto any player wishing to ease their way through Sorcery Saga. There are certainly more gameplay mechanics touncover, as is usually the case in roguelikes; but they will have to wait formy next run. If you are aware of a secret that I didn’t mention, feel free toexpose it in the comment section; and if you are planning to play Sorcery Saga, I wish you tons of fun andbon appétit! Thanks for reading, andbe my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Shiren the Wanderer (2): Getting into the right mindset", "date": "14/02/2015", "text": "Shiren the Wanderer has been on the back burner for an awful lotof time, and would probably still be there if not for my recent completion of Sorcery Saga. Beating that game gave mea boost of self-confidence in the rogueliking department and prompted me topick up Shiren again and try myhardest to clear it once and for all. It’s not even like I dropped it because Iwas bored or sick of it: I just put it down one day to concentrate on anothergame that I was playing at the time, and somehow forgot it completely. But I amstill in love with it and with roguelikes in general, and Sorcery Saga rekindled that flame, which is now burning brighterand hotter than ever.   The trick is to keep tryingThat is notto say that everything went fine and dandy—o no, precious. I may have cleared Sorcery Saga with a minimal amount ofstruggling, but Shiren is an entirelydifferent beast. Unlike SorcerySaga, Shiren is not the slightest bit forgiving, as I painfullyrediscovered when I dove back into it. Thingsstarted rather auspiciously, as strange as it may seem. I had left the game inthe middle of an equipment upgrading marathon, and my first decision was toclear said marathon in order to reacquaint myself with the game and give myselfas good an edge as possible over the perils that lay ahead. When I was donewith the deed, my Mastersword boasted a hefty Lv.60 and my Armor Ward a solidLv.27; and thus, armed with a couple of Riceballs and Staves, I forged aheadwith a dizzying feeling of anticipation. And amazingly enough, my strategyseemed to pay off: I reached the ultimate floor without being hindered andfound myself facing the last boss. The last boss, people! I was nearly there!Unfortunately, I made the fatal mistake of focusing solely on that mighty foe whileignoring the rest of the monsters. That was most uninspired, as a Skull Wraithwas part of that crew: the abomination swung his staff at me twice, first Sealingme and then Slowing me Down. The effects were absolutely disastrous: I couldn’tuse my items because of the Seal, and I could neither run away nor strikebecause of the Slowness. In the meantime, monsters had ganged up on me and werehitting me mercilessly; and there was nothing I could do but sit and watchpowerlessly as hours of toiling were reduced to mere dust in a couple ofseconds. When the last blow fell and I was sent back empty-handed to CanyonHamlet, I was absolutely crestfallen—so much so that I could nearly feel unshedtears of disappointment stinging the corners of my eyes. I closed the DS, shookmy head, and told myself that this was it. I was going to give up. There was noway I could get back on my feet after such a soul-shattering defeat.Of course,I’m making this more dramatic than it really was. Upgrading my equipment wasactually a fun process, and I enjoyed every minute of it; why else would I haveraised my Mastersword’s level to its maximum? My defeat was heart-wrenching, that much is undeniable; but hardly tenminutes later, I was already strategizing my next moves and plotting my revengeagainst the game. My second attempt at tackling Table Mountain was much morefocused and streamlined, because I knew exactly where I was headed and what Ihad to do in order to get there: and thus, it took me only a short time toupgrade my sword and shield (to Lv.25 and Lv. 14 respectively) before I headedfor Table Mountain again, full of poise and confidence. Everything went fine…That is, until I was transformed into a Riceball by a Skull Wraith—a Skull Wraith,AGAIN!—and killed in two hits. Back to Canyon Hamlet again, and goodbye to myprecious equipment again. This defeat was not as dismaying as the first one,however; instead, it had a decidedly irking flavour, because it showed plainlythat I was not learning from my mistakes and that the inner logic of the gamewas still eluding me somehow.The wrong and the rightIndeed, itwould be easy and convenient to blame these two demises on bad luck, but I feelthat there is definitely more to it; and after a bit of analysis, I think Imanaged to pinpoint the main reason for my failures. And that reason is quitesimple: I unconsciously approach Shirenas a 16-bit Action-RPG and play it accordingly. This misconception is fueled bythe game’s decidedly retro looks and by the fact that all things fighting takeplace directly on the field; and it has some dramatic consequences, as it warpsmy thinking and urges me to play in a way that is detrimental to my progression.Here is the unfitting course of action that this misconception prompts me tofollow, conveniently broken down in subsections:—Thy swordis thy life: Not only do I rely nearly exclusively on my sword to eradicateenemies, but I also have this irrepressible impulse to lash at everything insight with it. This prompts me to get close to enemies that I should rather runaway from or dispose of from a safe distance, with very unpleasantconsequences. This ram-like way of crawling stubbornly towards enemies andslashing them obstinately while enduring hits is tolerable in the early stagesof the game, when you only run the risk of taking a couple of arrows from aBowboy, having an item transformed into a Riceball by a Rice Changer or seeingyour Gitans licked away by a Pickpocket; however, it can be absolutely deadlyin the late stages, as my experience abundantly shows. My second demise can beblamed entirely on that persistent desire of mine to slash monsters at closerange: I was standing a square away from the exit when the Skull Wraithappeared, and given our respective positions, I could have left the floor ordisposed of the filthy creature before it swung its staff at me. Instead, Ifoolishly succumbed to my Action-RPG instincts and moved closer to the Wraith inorder to slice it in two—and the rest is dreadful history.  —Forsakenitems: As a consequence of that unwavering focus on sword fighting, I nearlynever use Staves or Scrolls to dispose of enemies. They lie forgotten in acorner of my inventory instead of being put to good use, which is both a pityand a shame. These repeated omissions are all the more galling as my twodemises occurred while I was sitting on a pile of Staves and Scrolls that couldundoubtedly have saved the day if I had used at the right time. Which leads usto…—The loststrategies: I resort to strategic thinking only when I am totally cornered—which,of course, is usually way too late to make any difference. The rest of thetime, I move forward with the grace of a bull and never bother to anticipateanything, let alone to tread carefully while looking around for danger. I donot take the time to survey and analyze situations in order to determine thebest course of action, preferring instead to swing my sword senselessly atanything in range. This was the main reason for my first demise, which could easilyhave been avoided if I had taken some time to ponder possibilities instead ofgoing straight for the boss’ throat.  Now that Ihave identified the underlying causes of my failures, I can plan a new courseof action that will hopefully lead me to success. The outlines are quitesimple, really: less speed, less sword-slashing, more strategizing and moredeliberate moves. Dispose of Skull Wraiths on sight. I’m also thinking ofstoring a couple of Light Scrolls in order to make the last floors easier tonavigate and getting my hands on a Storehouse Jar in order to save my equipmentin case of an imminent defeat. Last but not least, I am pondering thepossibility of exploring only two or three floors at a time with the mostextreme concentration instead of trying to clear the 15-floor stretch betweenCryptic Rock Valley and the Waterfall Cave in one shot. At any rate,I will soldier on. Shiren’schallenging nature has stirred my usually dormant competitive streak, and fromnow on, it’s a death match between me and the game. The sunny side of defeat  To behonest, these two defeats, for all the dismay they inflicted upon me, also hadsome positive effects. The most prominent one was that they somehow demystifiedthe last floors. Up until then, I had hardly dared venture past Cryptic RockValley—which I didn’t manage to reach so often in the first place; as a result,the second half of the game was deeply shrouded in mystery and became all themore intimidating. I must admit that I nearly became reluctant to forge ahead,which led me to bouts of procrastination —carefully concealed under thepretense of needing to upgrade my equipment just a trifle more or to collectjust an extra handful of items. Fortunately, I don’t need to fear those ominouslate floors anymore: exploring them at long last, be it to my demise, made themsuddenly feel much more mundane and accessible. I’ve been through the fire andgot burnt, but I’m not afraid anymore, and these floors are no longer out of mymental reach, which feels incredibly rewarding.On a morepractical note, these two failed attempts at tackling Table Mountain alsotaught me that it is not necessary to go overboard as far as upgrading isconcerned. The best weapons and shields can be raised up to Lv. 60, but thereis no need to go that high: a solid Lv. 20 is more than enough for both swordand shield. I’ve even read that Lv. 10-12 could pass, so maybe I will stick tothese lower levels for my next attempt. Why work more when you can work less?Given how tedious is can be to upgrade shields, lower level requirements wouldbe a true blessing indeed.Last butnot least, and on a more personal note, I have to admit that it would have beena tad disappointing to clear the game on my first real attempt. This would havecreated a very unbalanced gaming experience made of long hours of preparationfollowed by a short dash towards the end, which would have been anything butfulfilling. I’d rather have things the way they are, and I consider my numeroushours of toiling in Shiren as anecessary introduction to the roguelike genre—all the more so as these hourswere deeply entertaining, as I mentioned earlier. And there’s no doubt that myfuture victory will be all the sweetest after a couple of resounding failures.  And so, I keep on walking. My wandering daysare not over, and there’s no telling when it will be the case; however, you canexpect a third post that will wrap up that most amazing gaming experience ofgoing through the highs and lows of Shirenthe Wanderer. For now, I’m putting my getas on again for yet another climb. Jā mata ne! Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Sorcery Saga (1): Curry is happiness", "date": "07/02/2015", "text": "I dislike the curry spice, as well aseverything that is curry-flavoured; and yet, I found myself craving a good,warm plate of curry more than once as I played that game. That’s how powerfuland compelling it is.Okay, stop drooling. Let’s focus and startwith a morsel of data. Developed by Compile Heart and ZeroDiv and released in2013(jp/na) and 2014(eu), Sorcery Saga:Curse of the Great Curry God, as it is fully named, is a dungeon crawlerwith a strong roguelike flavour, as well as a curry one. I always love whengames incorporate food one way or another, and the way the curry element isimplemented in that game is deeply satisfying—but more on that later. SorcerySaga didn’t fare so well critically, reaping scoresof 65 on Metacritic and 69 on Gamerankings as well as mixed reviews on merchantwebsites. Reviewers pointed at a variety of flaws, from various glitches andbugs to excessive difficulty to the impropriety of the game’s humour anddialogues. Had I taken these reviews into account, I probably wouldn’t havebought Sorcery Saga; and it wouldhave been quite the loss, for I absolutely adoredthis game. It ticks all the boxes to qualify for the title of Perfect Game inmy book, although it is not exempt of flaws—which I will cover for fairness’sake. But for now, on with the goodness of SorcerySaga! We’re talking about a perfectly wholesome game that can sate one’sdungeon crawling and roguelike appetites in more ways than one, and here’s how. Easydoes itSorcerySaga undoubtedly lounges at the relaxed end of theroguelike spectrum. That still makes it considerably harder than any othergame, granted; but as far as roguelikes go, this is a very forgiving offeringthat shouldn’t pose a threat to anyone. I am still very much a beginner in therogueliking department and yet, I cleared this game without any major hassle. Don’tget me wrong, though: it is achallenging game that requires focus and dedication. However, this challenginggame remains fair, balanced, and most importantly, rewarding, thanks to ahandful of features designed to make your dungeon crawling more comfortable:—Upgrading your weapons and shields isrelatively easy. The game offers you a rather unusual blacksmith that I won’tspoil here: suffice it to say that weapons and shields can be upgraded in thecosy safety of the town at all times, providing that you own the necessarymaterials and monetary resources to do so. —Money can be safely tucked away in town—ina piggy bank in your own room, no less. —The game offers you an incrediblyconvenient item called “Transport Book”, which does exactly what it says, i.e.transport you back to town in the blink of an eye with all the items youcollected. Transport Books are rather easy to find, and having one with you atall times is the safest way to go. They put me out of a bind more than once,saving me from painful and/or utterly stupid deaths in the depths and heights ofthe dungeons.—Dungeons Merchants are a much more commonoccurrence than in, say, Shiren the Wanderer. They often sell interesting and reasonably priced items and aredefinitely a better shopping option that the single shop available in town,which only stores crappy random items that can easily be found for free in thedungeons. —A good range of useful Magic Spells can belearnt throughout the game. They include the classic elemental attacks, healingspells and buffs, as well as a couple of oddball abilities that can provepriceless to get out of a bind: one spell will revive you if you fall intobattle on the same floor, which makes it perfect for boss fights, while anotherone strikes all the foes in the room, which makes it the best choice to clearMonster Houses swiftly and efficiently. There is a luck factor involved,however, since Spells can only be learnt through the reading of Scrolls randomlyfound in dungeons. —All dungeons contain Warps that can takeyou back to town with all your items. (For the record, the five main dungeons containten to forty floors each.) Should you not be equipped with a Transport Book,this is a good alternative if you want to rest in the safety of the town,refurbish your inventory or tuck away valuable items. —Curses affecting items will be lifted assoon as you set foot into town, so it may be a good idea to hold onto anyvaluable cursed item until you exit the dungeon. —The game offers you a welcome tag system.Using a so-called ‘ID Scroll’ on any item will prevent said item from breaking,being stolen and, last but certainly not least, from being lost forever if/whenyou die. Instead, the item will be safely brought back to town for further use.The tag will be consumed in the process, though, so you will need another IDScroll to make the item safe and shatterproof again.—SorcerySaga also hands you on a silver platter a surefire way to keep yourequipped weapon and shield if you die. I am not referring to the aforementionedtag system, but to a more reliable and enduring method that works at all times.This is actually a very important point that deserves more exposition—so muchso that I’m planning to write a special addendum dedicated to the matter. Fornow, suffice it to say that losing your equipment is far from being a fatalityin Sorcery Saga and can be avoided, and quite easily at that. —To conclude this list, there is nopermadeath sensu stricto. Dying in adungeon sends you back to town empty-handed—or nearly so—but doesn’tforce you to restart the whole game from scratch: your progression up untilthat point is saved and any dungeon you cleared beforehand is cleared for good. Thanks to these excellent features, Sorcery Saga is as rewarding as it ischallenging. Upgrading your equipment is a slow and deliberate process that canbe time-consuming; however, the painstaking side of that process is balanced bythe fact that you can hold onto your precious honed equipment with a bit ofskill and care. Collecting money can be a pain and requires more often than notraiding dungeons and selling the loot, but any money you manage to grab can besafely tucked away for further use. Spells can be hard to come by, but they canbe learnt on the spot and ready to equip as soon as you come back to town. Andso on. Sorcery Saga always makes surethat your sweating and toiling won’t be wasted on a stroke of bad luck anddutifully rewards your perseverance by opening up slowly but surely. Indeed, ifthere are such things as forgiving and accommodating roguelikes, then this gameis definitely one of them.  Aflair for detailsThe goodness doesn’t stop here: Sorcery Saga glazes these wholesomebites of gameplay mechanics with a scrumptious coating of delightful atmosphereelements, cooking thus a delicious dish of a game. Sorcery Saga boasts a vibrantand immediately recognizable visual identity, both in its gameplay andanime-based segments: colours are bright and festive and everything looksdeliciously glossy and crisp, in typical modern fashion; yet the game strays away from boringhyperrealism—or from any kind of realism, for that matter. The sprites are bothgoofy and cute, with lovely detailed animations that make them incrediblyendearing. The storyline is just the way I like it:unobtrusive and not taking itself too seriously—heck, not taking itselfseriously at all would be closer tothe truth. There is a pleasant light-heartedness to it and it is packed withhumour, as well as excellently translated—which is quite a feat, especiallygiven the kind of humour involved. After having read reviews denouncing theso-called sexual harassment of main character Pupuru by so-called much olderguy Gigas, I somehow expected the worse dialogue-wise; however, my fears weretotally unfounded. The dialogues are loaded with ludicrousness and drippingwith irony, and it is simply impossible to take them seriously: the level ofsilliness and sheer nonsense involved is such that the whole narrative can onlybe described as a Japanese take on the Looney Tunes cartoons. As for Gigas’supposed harassment of Pupuru, it is more hilarious than creepy, really, andconsists in no more than over-the-top declarations of undying love—convenientlyrebuffed by Pupuru’s sharper-than-steel tongue. (The guy is not even that mucholder than her: while she is 15 or 16, he is obviously around 20. I know it canbe hard to attribute an age to anime characters, but it definitely comes acrossthat way.) Not surprisingly for a game whose storylinerevolves solely around cooking a batch of curry, references to food aboundeverywhere. Pupuru fights with forks, spoons, cooking knives, ladles and icepops while protecting herself with cutting boards and barrel lids—though fear not: there aremore conventional weapons and shields available—and faces enemies shaped ascurry ingredients. Beware the musketeer eggplant, the stern tofu and the deadlyrolling meatbun! Your faithful ally Kuu can gulp literally everything and isthe sole holder of the Hunger factor, a beloved staple in roguelikes: whilePupuru can go endlessly without eating a morsel, every step brings Kuu closerto starvation and the little chap must be fed regularly with whatever you findlying around. And sure enough, you can cook your own curry while roaming thedepths or heights of dungeons. You wouldn’t expect less from a curry-themedgame, would you? Such curry can be eaten by Pupuru or fed to Kuu and grantsthem a welcome stat boost; and while this is by no means a mandatory feature,it is incredibly satisfying to take a break in order to cook a batch ofdelicious curry—especially since the whole process is fully animated, withPupuru throwing ingredients into her trademark pot and stirring them beforewolfing down the whole plate and rubbing her belly with a sated look on herface. (Gee, I swear that I felt a pang of hunger every time I saw this.) All in all, Sorcery Saga’s atmosphere is incredibly pleasant, comforting andendearing. Just like the Shiren and Mystery Dungeon series, it pairsthe brutal gameplay mechanics inherent to the roguelike genre with a setting sogentle and soothing that you are always inclined to come back to it, no matterhow roughly the game treats you. This combination seems to be the blueprint forthe vast majority of Japanese roguelikes, and it works like a charm.SourbitesLike I said earlier, Sorcery Saga is pretty much a perfect game in my book; however,while loving it to pieces, I couldn’t help but notice a couple of flaws that Iwill now mention for the sake of information and equity. Lo and behold, here’sthe list of annoyances:—This is a matter of personal taste, but I totallyhated the music and voice acting. It is very much a miss-or-hit thing: the wholeaural package is so idiosyncratic that you will either adore it or loathe it.While the music is brilliant and genuinely original and the voice acting isexcellent, they are also so hectic and strident that they started grating on myears and nerves after only a couple of seconds—so much so that I actuallyplayed the whole game with the sound off. However, the next gamer may adorethat soundtrack—all the more so as the general consensus seems to be that Sorcery Saga indeed rocks in the auraldepartment. —The two post-game dungeons are an absolutebore. One of them is an exercise in fake longevity with its 256 floors—yes, 256—recycling the same layouts ad nauseam: this is nothing more than asenseless roaming marathon, an insane test of dungeon-crawling endurance. And Iwas masochistic enough to clear it. The other one is an exercise in frustration: itcontains only ten floors, but must be entered without items and cleared whilerelying solely on whatever you find in it. This is a thrilling challenge onpaper, but a half-failure in execution: the luck factor is so preponderant thatthere is virtually no chance to succeed unless you get a near-perfectcombination of useful items and convenient enemy placements. More often thannot, you just don’t have the right items no matter what, or enemies are toonumerous and/or blocking the only path, and so on. Despite my 40-or-soattempts, I never managed to get past the 8th floor, and I have nointention of doing so. These lacklustre extra dungeons are all the more disappointingas the main game dungeons are very well designed and an utter pleasure to roam;on the other hand, it could be argued that there is no need to make a fussabout the poorer quality of these extra offerings, given that are optional andnot part of the main game. It would be petty to complain about the lack offlavour of the digestives when the preceding meal was so delicious, wouldn’t it? —Last on this list are the slowdowns (orframe rate drops, as they are called nowadays) that occasionally plague thegame as you wander through dungeons. I normally don’t really mind such disturbances, and I wouldn’t even have mentioned these slowdowns if not for thefact that they are very pronounced,to the point of actually hindering the gameplay. Now, wait a minute: isn’t theVita supposed to be the most powerful handheld in existence? I would havethought that it could run a modest dungeon crawler without breaking a sweat,but it doesn’t seem to be the case. Oh, well.Now is the time to wrap up this post. Sorcery Saga is a delicious gourmet dishof a game that should definitely delight the palate of any roguelikeaficionado. It is pleasantly compact and keeps things mercifully short with itsfive main dungeons; however, it can be incredibly addictive, to the point ofmaking you lose track of time. I was shocked to discover that I actually spent40 hours playing that game, for they felt more like 15 hours to me, soengrossed was I by the gameplay. (Although I’d wager that a good 10 of these 40hours were devoted solely to the post-game dungeons.) Most importantly, thisgame made me feel happy. I felt amassive rush of giddy joy every time I thought about it, and the idea ofplaying it was enough to put a smile on my face; I couldn’t wait to pick up myVita and to immerse myself in that compelling gameplay and uplifting game world.Very few games can make me feel so elated: Dragon Quest IX was one of them, as well as Avalon Code and, more recently, Pokemon;and I am more than glad to add a new entry to this list. I’m not done yet with Sorcery Saga, both in terms of gaming andwriting; I will most definitely replay it—and certainly more than once, atthat—and I’m coming back soon with a meaty addendum full of yummy chunks ofuseful data. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Sonic Rush: Renewing the formula with zest", "date": "30/01/2015", "text": "If Sonic Classic Collection had the distinguished honour of being my first DS game, Sonic Rush had the equally distinguishedhonour of being my second DS game. When I got my first DS in 2011, it took me quitesome time to realise how humongous the DS RPG library was; as a result, theearly stages of my DS career were littered with familiar references such as these. Not that it is a bad thing, really: I love mySonic, and the Rush subseries is one of the best interpretations of 2D Sonicplatforming that I’ve ever encountered, as I will try to demonstrate very soon.But first, let’s have the usual bite ofdata. Co-developed by the Sonic Team and Dimps and released in 2005 in allregions, Sonic Rush was the first Sonicinstalment to grace the DS, and it was exclusive to the system. At that time,the DS was still brand-new, having been released barely a year before in Japan;and yet, the developers managed to get the most out of the console and to craftan amazingly polished game that could pretty well pass for a late-lifetimerelease. Without further ado, let’s now explore the adrenaline-filledawesomeness of Sonic Rush! Thename says it allIndeed, the mention of the word rush in the title of that game is nomere coincidence: Sonic Rush is thefirst Sonic entry that puts speed atthe heart of the gameplay. I’ve already established in my post about Sonic Classic Collection that if speed wasundoubtedly an inner characteristic of the Blue Blur, the early instalments ofthe series featured a gameplay based rather on careful exploration andquicksilver reflexes, with bursts of speed acting as a well-deserved rewardbetween lengthy segments of focused platforming. This template was abandoned inRush and replaced by a brand-new onein which momentum must be built up and maintained in order to progress assmoothly as possible. The upper routes can be reached only through clever useof speed, as opposed to the 16-bit instalments in which they could be reachedthrough careful platforming, and it is sometimes mandatory to muster andmaintain the maximum speed in order to avoid obstacles and survive. (Think ofthe boulder scene in Raiders of the LostArk and you’ll get a good idea of what these obstacles could be.) Talkingabout mustering speed, this is done through the use of the “Tension Gauge”, ameter that stores momentum and empties itself as you use said momentum. Thisgauge can be filled by using special items, killing enemies and, last butcertainly not least, by performing acrobatics while your character is beingprojected in the air by one of the many contraptions present in the game. Ontop of being useful, these acrobatics are a treat to pull out, and they replacethe speed of old as the reward factor: they pleasantly break the game’shigh-octane pace to offer the player a few seconds of giddy, silly fun. It ishard not to feel a thrill of pleasure and a feeling of contentment as you watchSonic or Blaze twirl gracefully in the air in a flurry of swift motions. SonicRush may be fast enough to make your head sway, butit does not forget its platforming roots. There are a good number of tricky platformingsections that require concentration and excellent reflexes: on top of demandingtop-notch precision, they include a speed factor that cannot be overlooked.React just a second too late and you will likely fall to your death, as thereis no second chance with such sections. And talking about falling, it is worthmentioning that Rush is undoubtedlythe most Mario-ish of all Sonic games:it contains a staggering number of bottomless pits, probably more so than allthe other 2D Sonic entries combined. Nostage is sparred from these wide, treacherous gaps, and they will claim a goodnumber of lives before you manage to master the gameplay mechanics and rememberwhere these annoying pits stand.   That game also manages the tour de force to introduce an awesomeally. The Sonic series is fairlyknown for not exactly mastering the art of creating secondary characters andfor harbouring a couple of epic failures in that department. I won’t quote anyname to avoid offending anyone’s sensibilities, but I think it is safe to saythat the sidequick business went a tad astray after Sonic3&Knuckles. Not so with Rush’s resident ally, however. Not only is Blaze a great characterin her own right, with her cat-like poise, fiery aura and ever-swishing tail thatmake her mesmerizing to look at, but she is also a completely viablealternative to Sonic instead of being a watered-down version of the Blue Blur:albeit a tad slower than Sonic, she has a handful of exclusive abilities thanare well implemented and pleasant to use. Last but not certainly not least, her relationshipwith Sonic is incredibly well-crafted and is undoubtedly the narrative highlight of the game. Said relationship is actually a revivalof sorts of Sonic and Knuckles’ one: starting off as opponents on the basis ofa misunderstanding, they occasionally interact and let the tension build upuntil a major showdown takes place, after what they realise that theyultimately strive for the same goal and decide to join forces. Rush reuses the formula and hons itsuccessfully, managing to erase the disappointing parts of the Sonic/Knucklesrelationship in the process. This is especially true regarding the epicshowdown, which went from an anticlimactic, low-key fight in Sonic3&Knuckles to a frantic andintense confrontation in Rush. Thisfight takes place at the end of the seventh zone, Dead Line, and the way to itis conveniently paved by subtle yet effective means. For one thing, Dead Lineis a conveniently difficult level that is bound to keep you on your toes andraise your blood pressure, making you all frayed and edgy by the time you reachthe end of the stage. For another, the respective musical themes of Sonic andBlaze, which up until then only showed subtle variations, are now much moreblatantly different from one another; this showcases the paroxysmal oppositionbetween the two characters, soon to be resolved through that ultimate fight.Both Sonic and Blaze are tough nuts to crack, and the confrontation is backedup by a gorgeous décor and a frenzied, adrenaline-popping musical theme. Thisfight is a masterpiece and delivers in all departments, unlike thedisappointing one against Knuckles in S3K. To close that list of goodness, a word mustbe said about the music. Composed by Hideki Naganuma, it incorporates vocalsamples and can be a hard sell at first: it is definitely not your classic Sonic soundtrack and is bound to bedivisive because of that. However, it boasts an undeniable originality factorand most importantly, it suits the game like a glove: it is hard to imagine asoundtrack that could better emphasize the feverish, nearly manic pace of Sonic Rush. Stillneeds polishOf course, no game can ever be deemedperfect, and Sonic Rush is noexception. It actually has a couple of flaws that are quite noticeable, albeitnot to the point of becoming deal-breakers. However, they are still worthmentioning, if only for information’s sake.The most blatant one is the generalshallowness of the level-design. The game’s emphasis on speed undoubtedlyforced the developers to craft significantly less intricate levels than in the16-bit instalments. Gone are the many secrets passageways, moving platforms andbooby traps that acted as obstructions in the first entries; in their placecome loop-de-loops, endless slopes and propelling devices that accommodate Rush’s faster gameplay and allow for thebuilding-up of speed. The collateral damage of such a design choice is thatlevels feel a trifle too streamlined and simple. Crossing them at full speedremains highly enjoyable, that much is sure, but it is also hard to deny thatthey feel just a little too empty and linear for their own good. Another irritating flaw is the generalmediocrity of the boss battles. These fights that should be moments of tensionand epicness play the part visually, featuring humongous mechas and gorgeousbackgrounds; however, they turn out to be quite tedious and clunkygameplay-wise. For one, they are incredibly repetitive. Apart from thedeliciously inventive bosses of Mirage Road and Night Carnival and the epicshowdown between Sonic and Blaze, all the battles unfold in the exact same way:Eggman tries to crush your frail rodent or feline body with a part of its giantcontraption before retreating in the background to fire at you; rinse andrepeat. This becomes old veryquickly. The fights are further marred by hitbox issues: the mechas have asingle sensitive spot that must be hit to hurt them, and it can be incrediblyhard to aim precisely at the said spot, especially as it tends to becomesmaller and smaller as the boss fights unfold. (The boss of Altitude Limit isprobably the worst offender, with its slippery head that seems to deflectblows.) As for the final showdown in space while sporting your super-form, itreally doesn’t deliver. Instead of being the climax of the game, it turns outto be a long, boring and tedious fight in which landing a hit is way toodifficult and random. Be prepared to cringe and shatter the time limit morethan once before you manage to master the mechanics of that confrontation. On a more personal note, I resent Rush for being the first 2D Sonic entryto have introduced a ranking system. I loathe trophies, achievements andranking systems with a passion, and it is supremely annoying to have acrappy rank slapped across my forehead after I enjoyed myself immensely while clearinga level—call me childish, but it doesruin my fun. It doesn’t serve any real purpose in the context of thatparticular game and seems to be nothing more than a thoughtless concession tocurrent gaming trends, which makes it even more galling. Still, these flaws remain minor ones. Sonic Rush remains a dazzling gem of agame that manages to renew brilliantly the series’ trademark gameplay. Rush’s brand-new mechanics are easy tolearn and master and soon become as pleasantly familiar and intuitive as the16-bit ones. As a matter of fact, I found myself instinctively trying to performthem in instalments that don’t support them, such as Sonic Colours; this is similar to the Spin Dash attempt case in thefirst entry and definitely shows that these mechanics are efficient and boundto endure. Most importantly, Sonic Rushgloriously conveys that feeling of giddy joy and blissful happiness so typicalof the series, perhaps more strongly than ever before: this game is a rapturousmaelstrom of sparkling colours, thrilling music and non-stop delirious actionthat can send the player on cloud nine—it did so for me, at least. It isdefinitely one of my favourite 2D Sonicentries, and I fervently hope to see a third Rush instalment grace the 3ds before the end of its lifetime.Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Class of Heroes (2): Solo Run, interrupted", "date": "21/01/2015", "text": "You didn’texpect less from me, did you?Let’s be honest: this time, I didn’t evenpretend to consider a classic party run and went straight for the solo option.The idea of micromanaging a team of six was simply unbearable; and if I had toreduce the number of party members, I might as well do it with full force andscale down my team to a one-man unit right away. As a matter of fact, I wasvery eager to tackle a solo run and see for myself if Class of Heroes was playable at all with a single character: given themany reviewers’ comments about the supposed difficulty of the game, it seemedto be a thrilling challenge fit for my fearless gamer’s heart. Abumpy rideAnd so, I dove into that challenge withgusto. I chose a Felpier as my one and only, mostly due to the fact thatFelpiers are one of the best-rounded races in Class, which makes them perfectly fit for a solo endeavour; andtheir cat-like features, complemented with a fitting haughty air, certainlymade them even more endearing to me. I then committed my first huge mistake,unbeknownst to me: I chose Warrior as my class, despite the fact that I hadenough Bonus Points to select any of the available classes. My reasoning wasthat I would get the opportunity to change classes later in the games and thata basic class such as Warrior was better fit for my first steps into the game.Little did I know that changing classes would turn out to be so cumbersome, andthat Warriors couldn’t learn that priceless Levitas spell that was so importantin the late stages of the game. I already explained how bothersome theclass change process was in my first post about Class, but it’s now time to use data lifted from my solo run toillustrate that point. One of the main issues with class change is how unfitthe random encounter rate is for level-grinding, as my experience showsabundantly: in thirty hours of gameplay with a single character and without runningaway from any field battle, I reached Lv. 31 only. Now that’s food for thought, isn’t it? This reveals howexcruciatingly hard it is to level up in that game, and by extension howimpossibly tedious it can be to change classes during the course of youradventure. Of course, class change was not on my mindin the early stages; I had other things to think of, like staying alive andgleaning enough money to upgrade my pitifully weak equipment. I resorted tovarious tactics to reach that goal, from the most straightforward to the mostunsavoury, on which I’ll expand later; and after a bit of sweating andtrudging, I could purchase a brand-new Talwar that suddenly made all thingsfighting much smoother. That’s not to say that my run became a walk in thepark: if the game was not as excruciatingly hard as I had expected and readabout, it still tested my determination on a regular basis by throwing nastyhindrances at me. The most prominent one was undoubtedly the occasionalpresence of floors requiring the Levitation ability to be crossed; since Icouldn’t perform the deed, I was forced to backtrack, exit the Labyrinth andenter it again in order to reset the floor layout and get a different one withno Levitation-only floors. Other minor hindrances included locked doors thatwould only open after a couple of attempts, trapped chests that would poison orhurt me and turn out to be empty, and enemies that were only sensitive to magicattacks that I couldn’t learn as a Warrior. All these hurdles were annoying andtime-consuming, but they were manageable nonetheless with the right amount ofpatience; and as a whole, roaming the Labyrinths was a fun and engrossingexperience that amply justified soldiering through a couple of obstructions. And thus I progressed through the game,slowly but surely, taking down bosses along the way and clearing one Labyrinthafter the other, and it was all nice and fine; until I found myself facing theultimate obstacle that would finally break my iron will. That obstacle, ladiesand gentlemen, is a huge difficultyspike located at the end of the game, precisely as you reach the last threeLabyrinths: Tohaus, Flake and Lark, the harbingers of doom. For one thing,Levitation-only floors are unescapable in these three: no matter how many timesI exited and re-entered them, there were always a couple of floors thatrequired Levitation to be crossed, if not allof them. This didn’t shatter my resolution, though: I was determined to clearthat game for good and overcome any obstacle thrown at me.  Since I didn’t have the necessary materialsto synthesize the equipment that would allow me to Levitate, the only optionwas a class change; however, that meant losing half of my heard-earned HP,which I loathed to do. I thus resorted to a milder option: recruitment. Icreated a Wizard Felpier and levelled him up until he learnt the much-neededLevitas spell, which I then used to explore and cross these frustratingLevitation-only floors at long last. Apart from his sorcery talents, thislast-minute ally was mostly useless: he could hardly fight and needed to beprotected from deadly blows that would have taken him down in two hits—we’retalking about the last three Labyrinths of the game, after all. Despite the fact that I could Levitate atlong last and thus progress through the last Labyrinths, and despite the factthat I stood virtually at End Game’s threshold, I still gave up in Tohaus aftertrudging through a couple of floors. The reason was quite simple: Tohaus, aswell as Flake that I tried exploring in parallel, feature floors that are anabsolute chore to explore. These floors bristle with warps tiles, hidden doors,fake magic keys and other annoying obstacles that are so numerous that theysteal away all the pleasure taken in exploring. This, for me, was a deal-breaker: I didn’t mind dodgingobstructions by the truckload, as long as it was entertaining; if this was notthe case, then I was out. And since I couldn’t derive any pleasure from theselast Labyrinths no matter how hard I tried, let alone progress efficiently through them, I gave up and put an end to mysolo run. That’s not to say that I gave up entirelyon Class of Heroes. I will certainlyplay it again sooner or later, putting my hard-earned experience to good use inorder to progress faster and more efficiently. And since I’m mentioning this,here are a couple of useful tricks for a smooth run, be it a solo one or aclassic party one. Enjoy!Tipsand tricks for an easy roam—I think I have made that point abundantlyclear by now, but it cannot hurt to repeat it one more time: your whole party must be able to Levitate,regardless of how many members it comprises. If a single one of your partymembers cannot perform the deed for whatever reason, you will be stuck all thesame, so be careful. The three races that possess the inner ability toLevitate, i.e. Sprites, Erdgeits and Celestians, are not the best-fitted onesfor a solo endeavour, nor are they fit to constitute a full party; and sincethe equipment that allows characters to Levitate is hard to synthesize, theeasiest way is to choose a class that can learn Levitas for at least one of your party members. This precious spellonly needs to be cast once, and voilà!Your whole party will start Levitating and will keep doing so as long as you’reon the same floor. (I cannot remember if the effect endures when you warp tothe next floor—sorry about that.) The classes that can learn Levitas for sure areWizard and Cleric; since this is a Black Magic spell, it may well be alsoperformed by advanced classes that can learn Black Magic such as Alchemist orSamurai, but I cannot assert this with absolute certainty. —Money can be a serious issue, especiallyin the early stages of the game. The classic, honest way to fill your purse isto glean some money by defeating foes and selling the loot you bring back fromthe Labyrinths; however, there is a quicker and dirtier way to get your handson much-needed hard cash. The game offers you a dozen of ready-made studentsavailable for recruitment, and each of them holds 100 golds; 100 precious goldsthat you can easily collect from them by letting them join your partytemporarily, going to the campus store, selecting “Sell” and using the “CombineMoney” command to secure all the cash into your own character’s purse. (Makesure that said own character is conveniently selected as the money reaper: agolden halo must be visible around their portrait.) Once you’ve convenientlyrobbed these built-in students, you can also strip them of their gear and sellit for more cash before getting rid of them. After you’ve depleted thesesources of riches, you can create as many students as you want and sell their gearbefore erasing them, reaping 50 golds for every student’s full equipment. Theprocess can be a bit lengthy and cumbersome, but it provides you with a virtuallyunlimited source of precious cash. Sure, it’s a bit sleazy; but there’s reallyno reason to play fair with a game that forces you to spit out 100 golds perparty member every time you want to sleep in your own dormitory. —And talking about the early stages of Class, I cannot recommend enough to useand abuse the instant save system when taking your first steps into theLabyrinths. Rescuing dead party members is an absolute chore, all the more soif your whole party was decimated; to avoid such annoyances and keep thebenefits of your early grinding, the best trick is to save literally afterevery single encounter. It may be a bit tedious, but it’s still ten timesbetter than having to recover the fast-rotting bodies of your party membersfrom the depths of the Labyrinths. —Check out dutifully all the shops youencounter—including the ones that can be found at stopovers between Labyrinths—inorder to look for Maps. All the maps of all the Labyrinths can be found in themany shops scattered across the game world, but many of them are exclusive toone or two shops only and cannot be found anywhere else. You don’t want to missa much-needed map and need to backtrack in order to get it, oh no precious.—Once again, this may be a no-brainer, butit’s still worth mentioning: all the floors have symmetrical layouts. The typeof symmetry used is not axial symmetry, but rather point symmetry (also knownas central symmetry) using the centre of the map as a reference point, whichcreates an inversion of sorts of the floor’s layout. At any rate, this meansthat once you’ve explored a portion of a floor, you can expect to find asimilar reverse design on the other half of the said floor, which makes explorationa trifle easier. —The Inner Sanctums of the Labyrinthscontain a couple of interesting features. First are the so-called “MagicCapsules” that can regenerate your whole party’s HP and MP and be used as manytimes as you want. Such capsules are the only opportunities to heal your partyat will while inside the Labyrinths, and they must be located first andforemost; some of them are hidden in secret rooms, but they are always present.The Inner Sanctums also systematically contain an Evoke Ring—which, as the nameabundantly implies, is the turf of Evokers only. Since my lone ranger was aWarrior, I couldn’t discover the purpose and effects of these rings and theywere virtually useless to me, which was a trifle frustrating. (Why create afeature solely for the use of a single class? This is pure unfairness, that’swhat it is. Oh, well.) And of course, Inner Sanctums also contain the entranceof the true “Labyrinths”: a single cut-throat floor which is home to all thebosses of the game. The distinction between these true Labyrinths and theordinary ones can be a trifle confusing, given that they are all lumped underthe generic “Labyrinth” term in the game’s dialogues and texts. However, theordinary Labyrinths contain the world “Path” or “Road” in their names and arereally nothing more than travelling ways—albeit particularly nasty ones,granted—while the genuine ones contain the world “Labyrinth” in their names:for instance, Kausa Path and Kausa Labyrinth. Genuine Labyrinths are also moreoften than not the place where various quests and major boss battles takeplace; if a mission requires you to reach the “X Labyrinth” in order to do something, it is undoubtedly referring tothe true Labyrinth whose entrance is hidden in the Inner Sanctum of thecorresponding Path. After this tip galore, it is nowtime for me to say goodbye to Class ofHeroes. My solo run of that game was a pleasant experience thatcould have been even more pleasant if I had chosen a better class:next time I play Class, I will make sure that I select a major that can learn spells. I will also play the secondinstalment, which I own and which is deemed much better than itspredecessor; and of course, I’m already licking my chops at the thought ofplaying the handful of other first-person dungeon crawlers that I own—the full Etrian Odyssey series, The Dark Spire, Shin Megami Tensei:Strange Journey, you name them. Hopefully they will prove to be even more delightfulthat Class of Heroes—which shouldn’tbe too hard, as a matter of fact. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Class of Heroes (1): Interesting yet uninspired", "date": "13/01/2015", "text": "This had to happen: my first everfirst-person dungeon crawler—but certainly not the last, perish the thought. But I’m getting ahead of myself there. Thereason why I never explored that RPG subgenre’s subterranean and cut-throatpaths is pretty simple: kick-started by the Wizardryseries in the early ’80s into a brief burst of fame, the first-person dungeon crawlersubsequently fell out of fashion before I was old enough to enjoy it properly.It became even less that a niche, with games released so sporadically that onecould be forgiven for missing them and thinking that the genre had diedentirely. Things remained that way until, by a sweet twist of fate, thisspecial brand of dungeon-crawling was rekindled in the late ’00s on portablesystems. En passant, it’s interesting and heart-warming to see how, in twodecades, the portable gaming industry went from being a watered-downalternative to the home consoles to becoming a lively Noah’s Ark for all kindsof niche genres—it’s good be a handheld gamer nowadays, indeed. But Idigress. This late revival of the first-person dungeon crawler was initiatedby two separate franchises: EtrianOdyssey on the Nintendo DS and Classof Heroes on the PSP, which I’m going to cover here.    Developed by Acquire and released in2008(jp) and 2009(na), Class of Heroescan be described as a kawaii and moe-infused take on the Wizardry series, in which the darkfantasy art is replaced by colourful anime sprites. The game quickly became quitepopular in its home country, as well as the de facto foundation of a whole newseries: three sequels and a spin-off were released on several platforms between2009 and 2012, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see the series head to the Vitain the next years. Seen from the West, the Japanese successstory of this first instalment is quite puzzling. Class of Heroes was not exactly welcomed with open arms by North-Americanreviewers, who collectively granted it the mediocre score of 61 on Metacriticand 60.45 on Gamerankings. And after playing it myself, my stance goes as such:Class of Heroes is an interesting andpotentially addictive game that is unfortunately marred by a couple of annoying practical issues and a problematic lack ofinspiration bordering on blatant laziness. It’s a pity and a shame, for therewas a lot of goodness there, as we’ll see right now.Agambling roaming festClass can be praised for revamping the genre to some extent and givinggood ol’ first-person dungeon crawler an unexpected twist. This twist is not tobe found in the school setting, as one may have expected—or feared: indeed,that setting is nothing more than a mere context element, and there is reallynot much to it beyond fancy denominations—classes being called “majors”, forinstance— and sailor outfits in lieu of sturdy armours. The real twist lies inthe combination of two factors that constitute the very core of Class, namely Exploration First and RandomStats.  Let’s first tackle Exploration First. Asthis denomination abundantly implies, exploring dungeons—or Labyrinths as theyare called in Class—is the primarypurpose of the game. Nothing too surprising here, given that Class is a dungeon crawler; however,exploration has been made incredibly easier and more convenient that in youraverage dungeon crawler. Everything is designed so that you can enjoy yourexploring sessions to the fullest: hindrances typical of the genre have beenneatly excised and replaced by features that make your roaming quitecomfortable and pleasurable. Without further ado, here are the most prominentones:—The game boasts an instant save systemthat is an absolute blessing. Not only can you save at any moment, be it onesquare away from a mighty boss, but you can also create as many save files asyour memory card can stomach: what’s not to love? This save systemcompletely eradicates the fear of losing your hard-earned progression, thusmaking way for a much more relaxed brand of exploration that lets you experimentto your heart’s content. —The random encounter rate is tailor-madefor exploration. In fact, it is one of the most perfect random encounter ratesI’ve ever been treated to: you meet foes often enough to level-up smoothly andregularly and seldom enough to explore in peace and discover large chunks ofdungeons at once. The balance is absolutely top-notch and undoubtedly one ofthe highlights of Class. Randomencounters somehow always seem to happen precisely at the right moment,offering a welcome diversion from exploration and a pleasant burst ofadrenaline; and providing that you never run away from them, you should alwaysbe powerful enough to tackle any challenge coming your way. —All the maps can be purchased at variousshops for a reasonable price, and they fill themselves automatically as youprogress through the Labyrinths. This is a much more forgiving approach thanthe one favoured in Etrian Odyssey,and it allows you to focus solely on moving forward, confident that any spaceyou clear will appear on the map—along with traps, warp tiles, magic doors, portalsand the like. There is even better: once you explore a specific floor layout,it is explored for good, and will be shown as such when it reappears in anotherLabyrinth—providing that you own the map of the said Labyrinth. Let’s now explore the second facet of thetwist, namely the Random Stats. To implement such a feature is a bold move thatis not so often encountered in the realm of RPG where level-grinding usuallyreigns supreme, and Class takes it toa level that I’ve never witnessed before. For, lo and behold: all the stats in that game are random.From your base HP and MP to the amount of XP and money you gain from battle,without forgetting foes’ HP, every single stat you’re bound to encounter in Class is subject to random variations,which transforms that apparently innocuous dungeon-crawler into a gambling gamein disguise. Apart from originality value, this feature has drasticconsequences on the gameplay: it dramatically undermines the importance oflevel-grinding and makes it somehow superfluous. Here are a couple of revelatoryexamples:—When you create a new character, you’re granteda certain number of so-called “Bonus Points” that you must allocate to variousbase stats in order to gain access to the class of your choice. You may thinkthat this number of points is fixed, but it is in fact totally random. Thelowest number of Bonus Points I’ve been allotted was 6, which grants access to acouple of basic classes; the highest was 35, which grants access to virtuallyevery single class. If your keep creating characters until you get aconveniently high number of Bonus Points, you can easily gain access to yourclass of choice from the get-go, which is incredibly neat—all the more so aschanging classes is quite tedious. But more on that later. —If you find yourself struggling against aboss, you don’t need to level-grind the slightest bit like in more conventionalRPGs. Instead, you can simply keep tackling that fight over and over until youget a stroke of luck, i.e. a version of the boss with pitiful stats. I oncefaced a boss that wiped me out after ten turns of arduous fighting; the nexttry, I took that same boss down in two neat turns. It’s all about persevering until luck humours you.—When you gain levels, your stats can be eitherraised or lowered, and you’re granted a random amount of extra HP. If you’renot happy with what you get, it only takes a quick reload and another try toreap more rewards from your leveling-up. This combination of Exploration First and Random Stats works like a charm. The random nature of the stats is a tongue-in-cheek move that pleasantly defuses the importance of level-grinding; it allows you to approach the game in a much more relaxed way and reinforces the focus on exploration, which itself is as smooth and comfortable as it can be. At its best, the game isbeautifully addictive and offers a flowing experience in which you simply can’tget enough of roaming the dungeons while testing your luck. Indeed, my sessions of Class often stretched beyond their initially planned boundaries, as I found myself riveted by the game and unable to stop myself from exploring just a trifle more. Alas,also a dragging festUnfortunately, Class is not always at its aforementioned best. Despite itsundeniable goodness, it is also weighed down by a number of blatant issues thatseriously undermine the pleasure one can derive from playing it. Lo and behold,here are the joy-killers: —The Labyrinths are horrendously bland, to the point of being seriouslydepressing. For one thing, a lot of them are unexplainably dark, offeringlighting only on the tile in front of you and leaving the rest of the room in acomplete murk. I have no idea if such a design choice was based on a lack offunds or on the desire to give the Labyrinths an aura of threatening mystery;but at any rate, the result is quite depressing, and more disheartening thanthreatening. For another, the Labyrinths are miserably empty: there is hardlyany scenery element to break the monotony of the smooth walls and floors, andhardly any chest to ransack; to add insult to injury, the few chests availablecontain only trinkets, or nothing at all—so much for the promise of precious treasureshidden in the depths of cut-throat dungeons. Last but not least comes the majorissue of the background tiles: there are only a few of them, recycled over andover again in all the Labyrinths with just a couple of tweaks here and there tocreate the illusion that this is a totally different place altogether.Unfortunately, the player is not blind, and the trick doesn’t work in theslightest. Add to this dreadful picture the fact that the music isnon-existent, consisting in only a couple of random notes that could make thelamest elevator music sound like a Bach sonata, and you get a shockingly dulland disheartening roaming experience that will bore the life out of everyonebut the most dedicated dungeon-crawler aficionado.—Changing classes is tedious and reaps moreinconveniences than rewards. The main issue is that unlike in games like Dragon Quest IX, the abilities you learnwhen donning a given class are not saved when you switch to a different class;only a limited number of spells can be maintained, depending on how many spellscan be mastered by the new class you’re donning. This is already stinging, butthere is worse: if you switch back to your original class, your hard-learnedabilities are not handed back to you à la Dragon Quest, nor is your HP; instead, youbasically restart from scratch. On top of all that infamy, your HP is dividedby two every time you change classes, which is just discouraging. If youcombine this with the fact that the encounter rate is actually too low to level-grind efficiently, you geta very neat case of fake longevity that can only appeal to the most masochisticgamer. All in all, the changing class process is so bothersome that I reallywish it wouldn’t have been implemented at all; it gives you a false sense ofsecurity by letting you believe that any ill-advised choice in the classdepartment can be amended later without too much hassle, which couldn’t befurther away from the truth. Class change should be facile and rewarding, ornot be at all, period. —Some of the Labyrinth floors cannot be explored at all unless you're able to “Levitate”—i.e. make your character(s) hover above the ground, be it by way of anitem, a spell or an innate ability. The problem is that the game never lets you know that Levitating is mandatory, not even in a veiled way. Now,maybe this is some kind of inside joke known to all first-person dungeoncrawler veterans; but as a newcomer to the genre, I discovered it the hard wayand I was none too pleased with that. To make matters worse, only a couple of classescan learn “Levitas”, the spell that allows you to perform that mighty task, andonly three races (Erdgeist, Sprite and Celestian) possess the innate ability todo it; as for the item that lets you levitate, it must be synthesised and the maincomponent is incredibly hard to find. (So hard, in fact, that I never found it.)Given that nearly all the floors of the latter Labyrinths require the use of the Levitationability to be explored, it’s incredibly easy to find yourself stranded with aparty that cannot perform the deed as you’re approaching the end of the game.Combine this with the impractical class change and you get an apocalyptic combo that can break the will of anyone but the most seasoned dungeon-crawlerveteran. When all is said and done, Class of Heroes is very much an averagegame. It has its highlights and offers a solid and enjoyable dungeon-roamingexperience, but it’s also painfully uninspired and cumbersome to the point ofbeing punishing. And yet, I poured thirty hours into that game without evennoticing it, and would have poured even more if not for the difficulty spike atthe end of the game—on which I’ll expand in my next post. The fact that I couldbecome so engrossed in such a passable game can only mean one thing: I foundmyself a new favourite RPG subgenre! And indeed, I’m dying to try morefirst-person dungeon crawlers, starting with the ones I already own. As for Class of Heroes, I’d like to think thatI will come back to it later, for there are many things left to discover andexperiment with; however, the thought of roaming these barren, barely litdungeons again makes me feel all gloomy and depressed. Maybe I need to let sometime pass first. A lot of time. I will give a thorough account of my run inmy next post, as well as a couple of useful tips that I learned during my trips through the Labyrinths.

{"title": "Coveted Games: Early 2015’s most excellent schedule", "date": "03/01/2015", "text": "First and foremost, Happy New Year 2015!May it be full to the brim with amazing games and glorious gaming moments. And indeed,amazing games there will be, and very soon at that. The early 2015 releaseschedule is at least as thrilling as the late 2014 one, if not more, with tonsof appetizing games coming our way in the next four months. I won’t get abreak from purchasing new games any time soon, indeed, and here’s myprospective early 2015 wishlist. Enjoy, and don’t hesitate to share your owncoveted games in the comment section!HyperdimensionNeptunia Re:Birth 2: Sisters Generation (Vita): Thisgame with an ludicrously long name is an enhanced remake of Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2, a PS3 RPGreleased in 2012. It’s also the sequel to HyperdimensionNeptunia Re:Birth, which was released in 2014 and was itself an enhancedremake of the original HyperdimensionNeptunia released in 2010 for the PS3. That is an awful lot of remaking,indeed; and it would definitely feel like a cheap trick to shove rehashed gamesdown consumers’ throat, if not for the fact that the series is hence migratingfrom the home console landscape to the handheld one for the first time in itsshort history. I never owned a PS3 and probably never will, so I’m delighted toget the opportunity to explore the Hyperdimensionseries on my beloved Vita. HyperdevotionNoire: Goddess Black Heart (Vita): Theaforementioned remake(s) may well be the prelude to a brand-new portable branchof the Hyperdimension series, if thismouth-watering Vita exclusive is any indication. It’s technically a spin-off tothe main series and features a SRPG-inspired gameplay as well as extracharacters lifted from famous video game franchises. Add to this the fact thatSting had a hand in its development and you get a game that I wouldn’t miss forthe life of me. CriminalGirls: Invite Only (Vita): A dungeon-crawler with aninfamous twist to it—on which I don’t think I need to expand profusely. Buttwist or not, I love dungeon crawlers to pieces and I certainly won’t miss thatone, especially since it seems to be pretty good once you leave aside thesoftcore sadistic gimmick—which NIS seems to have literally done to some extentby censoring the game a trifle. Given that the fan-service was ramped up when Criminal Girls moved to the supposedly moremature Vita, this may not be such a bad thing. Indeed, this game is not a Vitaexclusive, but rather an enhanced port of an eponymous game released for thePSP in 2010. This original instalment never came to Western shores though, soit’s pretty much a brand-new game as far as we’re concerned, which is quiteneat.  TokyoTwilight Ghost Hunters (Vita): A visual novel thatis virtually a Japanese version of Ghostbustersboasting revamped retelling of traditional ghost stories. Although this game isslated for release in April, there is little information available about it,apart from the fact that it should feature SRPG-lite gameplay segments,branching paths and several different endings. For some weird reason, Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunter iscategorized as an RPG on its official NIS webpage, although it seems to leanvery distinctly on the visual novel side. Well, I guess we’ll find out when itis released in April.OperationAbyss: New Tokyo Legacy (Vita): A first-persondungeon crawler set in a sci-fi setting yet using real-life locations—verylikely lifted straight from Japan’s lively capital, if the title is to bebelieved. The game’s young and still little-known development studio,Experience Inc., seems to be highly specialized in first-person dungeoncrawlers, having already crafted DemonGaze for the Vita as well as other similar titles that never left Japan. Demon Gaze garnered mixed reviews uponits Western release, and we can only hope that Operation Abyss will improve the formula and be granted a warmerreception. Gee, the world needs more dungeon crawlers! Or I do, as least. EtrianMystery Dungeon (3ds): And talking aboutmuch-needed dungeon crawlers, here’s another one coming our way, and a gloriousone at that. This is no less than a crossover of two of the most mythicaldungeon crawler series of the last twenty years: Etrian Odyssey, the series that single-handedly put first-persondungeon-crawling back on the map, and MysteryDungeon, the series that gives a roguelike twist to anything ittouches. Throw Atlus into the mix, and you get a dream game like no other. Thefirst screen captures are gorgeous, and I really can’t wait to get my hands onthat game. ShinMegami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker (3ds): As the title strongly hints, this game is an enhanced port of Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2,released between 2011 and 2013 for the Nintendo DS. Now, Devil Survivor 2 is one of the very few DS RPGs that I don’t own,so I should legitimately be thrilled about this 3ds port—and I actually am, andquite thoroughly to boot. However, this also leaves a sour taste in my mouth:to release a mere port—be it enhanced—of a game released just a couple of yearsearlier on the former generation’s resident system reeks of laziness andcomplacency. This kind of offense has become all too common on the 3ds, and Ireally hope that the developers guilty of such practices will soon stop restingon their laurels and start crafting brand-new games. MonsterHunter 4 Ultimate (3ds): Last but not least is thelatest iteration of Capcom’s immensely famous beast-slaughtering franchise.This much-awaited game has been slated for a Western release like, forever, and the whole thing is startingto look like a sick joke made at our expense. Whether we’ll get this game inlate March as announced remains to be seen, but one thing is abundantly sure: Iwill carefully check if I can tolerate the MonsterHunter brand of 3D before considering any purchase. So, here are my coveted games for early2015, and that’s quite a hefty number of them, really. Once again, they aremostly Vita games, and I’m grinding my teeth at the fact that only three 3dsRPGs are slated for release in the next four months—one of them being a port.The announcement of the upcoming Majora’sMask 3ds port and XenobladeChronicles New3ds exclusive port are making my mood even fouler, anddespite loving Nintendo to pieces, I’m starting to grow a trifle tired of thewhole 3ds affair. First region-locking, now an endless stream of ports, andsoon yet another version of the system with exclusive games? This is a littledisheartening, really. I wish we could get new entries for Golden Sun, Seiken Densetsu,Advance Wars, Fire Emblem and Final FantasyCrystal Chronicles as well asbrand-new innovative RPGs instead of remakes, ports and homages. Don’t get mewrong: I am totally in favour of remakes and the like, especially when they allow potential players to (re)discover games that slipped under the radar in their time or were released very long ago on much older systems. However, I firmly think that remakes and ports shouldonly represent a small fraction of the releases on a platform and that developers should lavish attention on new titles first and foremost. The DS library has aperfect balance in that regard, with loads of fresh and innovative titles and acouple of excellent remakes; and now that the 3ds is conveniently loaded withremakes and ports of all sorts, I fervently hope that it will be showered withbrand-new games before the end of its lifetime. There is always hope, indeed! That being said, and to end on a positivenote, I’m really thrilled about all these upcoming games, whether they be onthe Vita or the 3ds. I will absolutely purchase them all, and review them whenthe time is ripe. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Freedom Wars: Hello and farewell, 3D", "date": "27/12/2014", "text": "As much as it pains me, I won't be able to play Freedom Wars any time soon. Or ever, for that matter.The reason is quite simple: this game makes me sick. Like, physically sick. Believe it or not, Freedom Wars is the first 3D game I've ever played in my entire gaming life. When saying \"3D game\", I do not refer to the 3ds type of 3D and the games that accommodate it, but rather to games that let you move in every direction on the X, Y and Z axes and rotate the camera at will. I've seen people play such games, but I never did so myself, for I always felt strangely reluctant to try my hand at this type of gameplay. And maybe there was a very good reason for that, after all, since it turned out that I literally cannot stomach the visualization.To put it simply, Freedom Wars gave me motion sickness—or simulator sickness, as it is called when applied to video games. The handful of gameplay sessions that I went through gave me terrible headaches, along with nausea and alarming signals that my lunch could go through rejection. I gave up on playing rapidly and researched the matter a little bit, and it turned out that I'm not the only one suffering from that rather modern gaming issue. Some people suggested playing the incriminated games over and over in short sessions to overcome the problem, but the thought of enduring headaches and nausea until I hypothetically manage to get used to the 3D visualization was more than I could bear, so I decided to give up entirely on Freedom Wars instead. It certainly doesn't help that I never felt attracted to 3D games in the first place. I've always found such games confusing and messy, and the need to rotate the camera really rubs me the wrong way. Call me lazy if you wish, but I really think that this kind of petty tasks should be handled by the game in order to let me, the player, indulge in more interesting things. I'm perfectly happy with a camera that focuses on my sprite and follows it at all times while I'm slashing my way around and exploring areas shown from pre-determined and fixed angles. Heck, I'm more than happy with it: that is the sole way I want my games to be—all the more so as it is now proven that I cannot tolerate full-blown 3D games. Jeez, if the whole gaming industry goes HD and 3D in the next decade, I might become a full-time retro gamer much earlier than I expected. Oh, well. At any rate, I will not play Freedom Wars, nor will I purchase any other 3D game from now on. As for the couple of other 3D games that I own, I will give them a brief try and see if I can tolerate them—although I don't have much hope: even though they made me less sick, there would still be the camera issue to irritate me. But time only will tell. Since I had such lofty expectations regarding Freedom Wars, I was quite crestfallen by this turn of events. Compensation was definitely needed; and since I was really in the mood to lavish attention on my Vita, I started playing Sorcery Saga. I was instantly hooked, and my disappointment was forgotten. It's sweet to have a massive game library, indeed. Now that the Christmas rush is over, I can get back to my normal writing schedule with much joy and relief. I apologize for the delay and thank you profusely for your patience. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},

{"title": "Sonic Classic Collection: Jewels with rough edges", "date": "25/11/2014", "text": "It’s time to reveal my dirty little secret:I love Sonic games. Not the late 3D abominations involving gunsand human princesses, mind you, but rather the classic 2D side-scrollingentries—starting with the much-loved Megadrive/Genesis ones. I thoroughly dislikeplatformers as a rule, but the Sonicseries is and has always been the feisty, high-octane exception: from themoment I discovered the Blue Blur on the then brand-new Megadrive/Genesis backin 1991, I became hopelessly smitten. To this day, classic 2D Sonic games remain a guilty pleasure ofmine, never failing to treat me to a ravishing avalanche of sparkling colours, effervescentmusic and delirious fast-paced action. Oh, how I love these little darlings. As a matter of fact, I love them so muchthat it was the compilation of old-school Sonicgems mentioned in this post’s title that definitely tipped the scales andconvinced me to get a DS a couple of years ago—and the rest is history. (Knowingthe intensity of the 16-bit era feud between Sega and Nintendo, this is morethan a little ironic.) Let’s now explore that scrumptious collection of classicSonic goodness, starting with theusual bit of data: developed and published by Sega and released in 2010 in allregions, Sonic Classic Collection is,as its name implies, a compilation of all the canon Megadrive/Genesis Sonic games—bar the elusive Sonic CD and the much-maligned Sonic 3D Blast. Interestingly, thesegames are not strictly ported but rather emulated, using a special Megadrive/Genesisemulator for the DS; and as you may expect from emulated games, they feature numerous graphical glitches and collision bugs. To be honest, this compilation is ratherlacklustre as a whole, but getting the opportunity to play these games on aportable system is such a treat that I’m definitely not complaining. I’ve been replayingthe full package lately, as I often do at this time of the year: for somereason, dark and cosy autumn afternoons seem to be quite conducive to some Sonic indulgence as far as I’mconcerned.  Given how far-off the Sonic series has drifted in the last fifteen years, it’s easy tocast these early entries as monuments of gaming perfection, gems that nailedthe perfect formula right away. It’s so easy, in fact, that they are invariably presented as such and hailedas the pinnacle of the series by hordes of wistful old-timers. However, Sonic’sdebuts were not exactly as immaculate as nostalgia would have us believe.Quite appropriately for such a speedy gaming icon, Sonic’s early career was arelentless run against the clock: deadlines were challenged constantly andgames were released at the speed of light—four in four years, which is quite abreakneck pace, even for those times. This constant rush created a number ofissues that I will cover in that post; for despite being a rabid classic Sonic fan with a heart fluttering withnostalgia, my analysis skills are still alive and well, ready to be unleashed.Let’s do that right now!Sonic1: Adrenaline-filled debutantOfficially known as “Sonic the Hedgehog”, this is the game that started it all andsingle-handedly granted Sega a short-lived but glorious dominion over thegaming industry in the early ’90s, propelling the Megadrive/Genesis way aheadof the Nintendo systems in the console race. This was an achievement that wentfar beyond all expectations: despite the fact that Sonic was pretty much forcedinto existence by Sega in a feverish attempt to challenge and sap Mario’sdominance over the platforming kingdom, no one could have envisioned that theBlue Blur’s 1991 debut would be such a smashing success. This venerable first game establishedrock-solid templates that subsequent instalments would dutifully conform to inthe following years, all the way up to the current gaming era. Indeed,everything was contained into Sonic’sdebut: the bright and sparkling colours, the bouncing musical themes, thelevels with strong and recognizable visual identities as opposed to the moregeneric-looking ones found in Mariogames, the Chaos Emeralds that could be earned by taking a trip to a specialstage with distinctive gameplay mechanics, the habit of kick-starting the gamewith a vegetal and /or tropical-themed stage, the booby traps by the truckload,the rings acting as life insurance, and so on. It was all there, and it workedbeautifully. The lush introductory stage Green Hill is one of the most famousin platforming history, and hearing a few notes of the eponymous musical themecan send a whole generation of gamers into a teary-eyed bout of nostalgia. Interestingly, the legendary speed of theBlue Blur didn’t quite translate literally into that first entry; it was moreof a publicity stunt pulled out by Sega, similar to the elusive “blastprocessor” supposedly hosted by the Megadrive/Genesis. Sonic the Hedgehog’s gameplay is not based on speed, but rather oncareful exploration, precise jumps and sharp reflexes: this game is not aboutrushing your way through the levels, but rather about masterfully using thewell-honed physics to dodge an endless stream of booby traps and uncovercleverly hidden items or shortcuts. In a supreme display of perversity, theSonic Team went as far as to include a level in which the physics are alteredand Sonic is dramatically slowed down, the infamous and nightmarish LabyrinthZone. Far from being the norm, bursts of speed are granted sparingly as awell-deserved reward for the player’s toiling, a welcome handful ofadrenaline-filled seconds before the next booby trap in line. The iconicloop-de-loops and long slopes that somehow became the series’ trademark are fewand far between, to the point of being totally absent of half of the levels. Talkingabout the levels, they are carefully and cleverly balanced: the game starts offwith the lenient Green Hill Zone, immediately followed by the more demandingMarble Zone, before cutting the player some slack again with the more forgivingSpring Yard Zone, and so forth until the end, creating a harmonious and highlyenjoyable gameplay experience. The game is not that long, but it’s fun frombeginning to end, and it aged so gracefully that it’s still very much worthplaying today. The self-indulgent corner:—Favourite level: Marble Zone, with its mixof challenging underground areas and more forgiving outdoors. Gee, that runagainst the lava terrified me when Iwas a kid.—Favourite music: Marble Zone, again. GreenHill has a greater nostalgic value, but in terms of pure aural pleasure, MarbleZone definitely takes the cake, with its awesome bass line and gorgeous arpeggios.Sonic2: Harder, better, faster, strongerReleased just in time for Christmas 1992, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was probably one ofthe most anticipated games of all times. Sega and the Sonic Team needed toestablish firmly that Sonic was an icon meant to last and not a mere fleetingsensation, and they did so by introducing moreof everything: more levels, morecolours, more features and, last but not least, more speed—both during the development process and in the game itself.This led to some mixed results, as we’ll see soon.  Sonic2 introduced the Spin Dash, a move that became sointuitive and popular that one can easily find themselves trying to pull it outin Sonic 1, only to be reminded thatit was not yet implemented. Sonic 2also kick-started the habit of introducing new sidekicks in every entry withthe entrance of two-tailed fox Miles “Tails” Prower—a nice pun on the “milesper hour” expression. With the fox came the thrilling possibility of localmultiplayer, which was much welcomed and acclaimed; and if you wanted to playsolo, the game would still let you pick up Sonic or Tails alone—which was alsoquite welcome, since an uncontrolled Tails could occasionally get you into hotwater by interfering during boss fights or triggering mechanisms without yourconsent. Sonic2 is notably faster than its predecessor, with manymore loop-de-loops and slopes of all shapes and sizes and feistier physics that let yourun at a breakneck speed and jump higher and further. However, this extra speedcomes at a price, which is the lack of much-needed precision. It’s notablyharder to land precisely where you want and controlling your momentum is oftenentirely impossible, which regularly leads you straight into the open arms ofthe many booby traps littering the game. And let’s not even talk about thebrand-new Super Sonic transformation, which is just a giant running glitch andsimply cannot be controlled in any efficient way. Speed also hurt the development process. Sonic 2 is by far the entry that was themost amputated and butchered, with potentially interesting concepts and areasexcised in order to meet the Christmas 1992 deadline. Such losses are already stingingenough, but this rush also led to some serious unbalance in the finishedproduct: unlike Sonic 1 that cleverlyalternated between lenient and demanding zones, Sonic 2 is clearly divided in two as far as difficulty isconcerned, with the lenient areas lounging in the first half of the game andthe demanding ones lurking in the second half. This structure makes the gamevery conducive to ragequits towards the end, especially since Sonic 2 is considerably longer than Sonic 1. Some inconsistencies can alsobe observed, like the fact that Metropolis Zone contains three acts instead oftwo like the other Zones: this third act was initially supposed to be an exclusive Zone, before being scrapped and recycled into a very unwelcome extension of the most annoying level in the entire game. (Was that really necessary, I wonder.) There is also anoccasional lack of inspiration: areas like Casino Night and Oil Ocean sufferfrom a shallow level-design, and Hill Top Zone is nothing more than acopy-paste of Emerald Hill with a different colour palette and background.  Because of these flaws, Sonic 2 is by far my least favourite ofthe classic Sonic games, and the onethat I care the less to play nowadays. Ever since I started playing it twentyyears ago, runs always unfold in the same exact way: I immensely enjoy thefirst four levels, before things start growing stale as I cross thegeneric-looking Hill Top Zone; and by the time I reach the end of MetropolisZone, I’m just vomiting the game.When I occasionally forge ahead, I usually rage-quit at the end of WingFortress Zone or during the ridiculously hard final boss fight. And yet,because it’s Sonic, I would stillplay that game over any other platformer. It’s also worth noting that theseflaws didn’t tarnish the game’s reputation the slightest bit nor stood in itsway to greatness: Sonic 2 is a fanfavourite as far as the classic entries are concerned and was anointed a cultclassic nearly as soon as it was released. The self-indulgent corner:—Favouritelevel: Aquatic Ruin Zone. A lush level full to the brim with nooks and cranniesto explore, with a pleasant ancient vibe and gorgeous musical theme to match.Hearing the soft froufrou of the leaves as you make your way through the vinesis just enchanting. —Favourite music: The 10th songin the sound test, which is widely believed to be the theme of the scrappedHidden Palace Zone. A bit loopy, but very intense and evocative, with a solemnand poignant edge to it. Sonic3/Sonic&Knuckles: 2 much, 2 soonOh, dear. Where do I start with these ones?Both released in 1994 a mere couple of months apart, Sonic 3 and Sonic&Knuckleswere originally conceived as a single giant game that should have been thethird in the series. But that was before time and budget constraints rearedtheir ugly heads again and forced the Sonic Team to cut the game in two partsand release them separately. The two cartridges could be connected thanks tothe so-called “lock-on technology” in order to play the game in its entirety,making way for an amazingly fulfilling gaming experience; in addition, thelock-on system also made possible to play Sonic2 as Knuckles, offering a fresh new outlook on the game.Sonic3 and Knuckles or S3K, as I love to call it, is by far the most polished of theclassic Sonic games. It introduces afresh batch of innovations that are still used in 2D Sonic entries nowadays, such as the save feature, the music themevariations between the two acts of each zone and the final mega-boss fought inspace while sporting your super form. Tails is playable and can fly at longlast, while new foe-turned-sidekick Knuckles is treated to its own exclusiveroute, shorter yet harder than Sonic and Tails’ one. S3K contains a modicum of narrative, which was quite a new thing inthe series: short cutscenes show our heroes progressing from one zone to thenext and interacting with foes. The level design is at its peak, withcolourful, rich and complex zones bristling with alternative routes and secretsand a near-perfect balance between exhilarating speed and tricky platforming.This is probably the only classic Sonicgame in which you can get dangerously close to the time limit in some levels—ifnot break it entirely. The physics are just as polished: they are marvellouslyintuitive and perfectly blend the precision of Sonic 1 and the alluring speed of Sonic 2 while adding an extra layer of control and slickness.Fine-tuning your jumps and your momentum is easier and smoother than ever, evenin your super form. And talking about this, Tails and Knuckles are also treatedto a super form in that game, even though they are not allowed to take part in thefinal epic showdown in space. A lot of work went into designing specificabilities for each character in order to create different gameplay experiences:Tails can fly, Knuckles can glide, and Sonic has access to a range ofdouble-jumps with various properties. It’s fair to say that the Sonic Teamabsolutely outdid themselves with S3K.This game is an amazing piece of Sonicgoodness and one of the most brilliant entry in the series. It’s my favouriteof the classic Sonic instalments andprobably the game that I cleared the most runs of in my entire gaming life, andI have the fondest memories of some cosy afternoons spent playing it in co-opwith my sister. And yet, despite that game’s undeniable awesomeness, it is farless popular and well-known than Sonic 1or Sonic 2, and sold considerablyless. And the reason for this lack of popularity and poor sales is crystal-clear:this game was sunk by its birth defect. Cutting it in two halves and sellingthem separately may have appeared as a brilliant coup at the time, a decision that would both reduce productioncosts and maximize earnings; however, it considerably tainted the game’s imageand damaged its legacy beyond repair. Sonic3 and Sonic&Knuckles havealways been seen as two separate games because they were physically sold assuch; and their reunion, which should rightfully be viewed as the real deal, isinstead considered a chimera of sorts, a mere extra option similar to thepossibility of playing as Knuckles in Sonic2. That wouldn’t be such a huge problem if the two games taken separatelywere excellent; but unfortunately, they are quite unsatisfying as standaloneexperiences. For one thing, they are way too short to satiate the player’s cravings;for another, some excellent features are missing from both of them, like thesave system and the possibility to play as Tails in Sonic&Knuckles and the possibility to play as Knuckles in Sonic 3. It’s quite a pity that theSonic Team were not allotted an extra year of development time to polish thisgame and find ways to squeeze it into a single cartridge; had it been done, thelegacy of S3K would certainly havebeen much more dazzling and memorable. The self-indulgent corner:—Favourite level in Sonic 3: Ice Cap Zone. I love ice levels as a rule, and this one isone of the most beautiful I’ve ever played—and it has very few slippery areasto boot. What more can you ask for?—Favourite level in S&K: Lava Reef Zone. A gorgeous crystalline area with tworadically different acts, complex but not overly labyrinthine. I can’t getenough of this one, really. —Favourite music in Sonic 3: Ice Cap Zone. What else? The  ’90s techno-dance vibe of that track is justirresistible. I’m even fonder of the more subdued Act 2 version. —Favourite music in S&K: Flying Battery Zone. Oh, what a blast! Fast-paced andintense, this track is the aural incarnation of (in)trepidity, and both of itsversions are awesome. I also have a soft spot for the mini-boss theme, which Ifind even more epic than the main boss theme.   Here ends my love letter to the classic Sonic games. Of course, it goes withoutsaying that as a rabid Sonicaficionado, I encourage everyone to try these old-school gems. They may haverough edges, but they are gorgeous and dazzling nonetheless. As you may expect,I own every single portable Sonic entry,and I will cover them all when the time is ripe. Now that my dirty littlesecret is out, I have no reason to hold back, do I? Thanks for reading, and bemy guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Astonishia Story-Addendum: The final showdown (SPOILERS!)", "date": "18/11/2014", "text": "Here weare, back for more 8-bit-lite scrumptiousness. AstonishiaStory’s final boss battle deserves a bit more exposure, especially on thestrategic side. It can be a tough nut to crack: as I mentioned in my main post,I needed no less than five tries before I finally managed to eradicate thisboss duo, and the whole ordeal was so painfully hard and unfair that Iseriously contemplated giving up on that final fight and moving on to anothergame. My desire to quit was further fueled by a misconception that runs rampanton the internet—which I will address and dismantle for good, for it deserves tobe buried forever. Despite seemingly having all odds against me, the idea ofquitting so close to the end was so dispiriting that I decided to forge aheaduntil I succeeded—or got the unequivocal, painful confirmation that I couldn’tsucceed. In other words, slaughter the bosses or die tryin’. So, here wego! We have two bosses to slaughter, but this is in fact a four-act fight. Thepreliminary phases are at least as important as the fight itself, if not more,so let’s start with them. Act 1: PreparationsIt’sabsolutely crucial to be well-prepared for that final boss fight. It’s socrucial, in fact, that neglecting the necessary preparations will unavoidablylead to a stinging defeat—which is notpleasant, especially if it happens after thirty minutes of arduous fighting. Triedand tested, folks. First,let’s talk about levels. There is no mandatory level to beat the bosses like inyour traditional 8-bit RPG (think Ys,in which a couple of extra levels would allow you to slaughter easily a bossthat previously beat you to a pulp), which is quite ironic given the heavy8-bit flavour of AS. The very fewFAQs available advise a solid Lv. 25, which is the maximum attainable level;however, it’s perfectly possible to tackle that final fight with a slightlyweaker team. By the time I reached the bosses, my party members’ levels rangedfrom Lv.20 to Lv.23 only, but that didn’t hinder me the slightest. The fiveunsuccessful attempts that I mentioned above were only due to bad luck andstrategic adjustments, all matters that I will cover later in this addendum. Let’s moveon to the equipment. It’s highly recommended to have the sturdiest armoursavailable, as well as the strongest weapons. The game puts you at such a highdisadvantage with your foes in this final fight that any modicum of strength isgood to take, even though it won’t massively bend the odds in your favour. Last butnot least are the items. They are clearly the most important part of thepreparations, and the most vital of them are the MP-restoring items. The reasonis simple: you will need metric piles of MP in that final fight—so much so thatyou will spend much, much more time replenishing your MP than your health.Yeah, it’s that bad. For a smoothrun, I would advocate stocking up on Super Ultra Potions—at least a good 30 ofthem, and up to 50 if you really want to play it safe. Grilled Eels and MagicPotions can obviously be used too, but they restore so little MP that resortingto them will drag on the fight endlessly. As for the HP-restoring items, 30 King’sLunch Boxes should be more than enough to cover your needs, especially if youalso own less nutritious items such as Meatloaves or Grilled Eels. Having adozen of Seeds of Life cannot hurt either: resorting to them to revive deadcharacters instead of using Ylenne’s or Jenas’ reviving spells allows you to saveyour precious MPs for the eradication of the bosses. Last but not least are twoitems that could seem minor but are actually tremendously useful in the contextof that final fight: the Red Pepper Powder and the Smoke Shell. The first will grantyour attacks a welcome boost and thus shorten the fight, while the second willallow you to flee without fail from any random encounter in the final dungeonand thus avoid wasting some precious MP-restoring items on your way to the bosses’lair. A good 30 of each should be more than enough to assure you a smooth ride.And since the final dungeon that I just mentioned happens to be the secondpreliminary act of the final boss fight, let’s move on to it with no delay!Act 2: Fort GanbergFortGanberg is quite a pleasant place at first sight, with its beautiful purplewalls and coppery floors full of antic solemnity and its soothing music. Butdon’t let that beauty lull you: this is actually a nasty place that can betricky to navigate, and you will need all your vigilance to make it safelythrough that antechamber of doom. As you’drightfully expect from a final dungeon, Fort Ganberg is the longest dungeon inthe game. It’s not labyrinthine to the point of being nightmarish, though,which is quite a good thing. The difficulty of that dungeon stems rather fromthe fact that it pits you against annoyingly strong field enemies that areconsiderably faster or stronger than your party members and/or immune to a vastrange of elemental attacks. The encounter rate is fortunately not higher thanin any other dungeon, but these random encounters may still be a seriousannoyance and considerably slow down your progression as well as deplete yourprecious stock of MP and HP-restoring items. This is where the Smoke Shell thatI mentioned earlier reveals its full potential by conveniently allowing you toskip any unwanted battle. Somebattles are mandatory, though: Fort Ganberg throws no less than five sub-bossesat your face, which is probably the highest number of these pests that I’veever seen in an RPG. These bosses are not particularly tough and shouldn’t betoo much of a challenge; however, once again, they pose a threat to yourprecious stock of healing items. A good way to circumvent that inconvenience isto use the aforementioned Red Pepper Powder to clear these battles faster anduse less restoring items. Of course, an even larger stock of restoring itemscan also do the trick; but at any rate, parsimony regarding the use of theseprecious items is the key. Last butnot least, Fort Ganberg has an old-school puzzle in store for you. To open thedoor to Brimhild’s chamber on the 3rd floor, you need to visit thelibrary first and probe all the bookshelves in a counterclockwise motion inorder to find and read seven chronicles. Once this is done, a sub-boss fightwill take place, after which you can proceed to the final fight. It’s time forthe epic showdown, folks! Act 3: BrimhildThemagnificent and fearless Queen of Elves is a powerful foe that must not betaken lightly. After a bit of exposition, the fight per se will start, pittingyou against Brimhild and four of her cronies. Despite being only the first halfof the final showdown, this fight against Brimhild is actually the trickiestpart of it; and it is so because luck plays a major part in it. This luckfactor boils down to a specific attack wielded by the Queen, namely the potentMeteor Attack, which can kill your party members in one single shot. This spellhas an uncomfortably wide range, and if Brimhild decides to march on your partyand cast it, it’s death time. She doesn’t use it too often, however, so it’sworth taking the risk to approach her and pummel her to death with close rangeattacks. The beststrategy for that fight is to concentrate first on Brimhild’s cronies and takethem down with long-range attacks. They are particularly weak to Jenas’Lightning Harken, so it may be a good tactic to devote the young Elf lady solelyto the eradication of these meaner foes while the rest of your party gang up onBrimhild. The Queen herself has no major elemental weaknesses, so it’s really amatter of patiently wearing her down and eating away her HP bar while prayingthat she will not use Meteor Attack. Using some Red Pepper Powder will speed upher demise and lower her chances to do so, so don’t hesitate to resort to it. Ifyou’re out of luck that day and if she does cast the deadly spell after all, chancesare high that every party member involved will be eradicated on the spot. Ifonly one or two characters are killed, you can afford to leave them dead andconcentrate on Brimhild in order to neutralize her before she can get a chanceto cast another Meteor Attack. A couple of dead party members are acceptablecasualties for that fight, given that you’ll be given all the time you need toheal them when the second half of the final fight unrolls. And since I’mmentioning this…Final Act: KaisirakThis is thehome straight, the last obstacle between you and the happy ending. Kaisirak maynot look that terrifying at first sight: it’s stuck in place on the uppermiddle part of the screen and never moves from there, and it only has two attacks.However, the potent efficiency of these attacks makes up for their small number:one of them is 1st Barrier, which allows the already resistant whitedragon to become even more immune to our pathetically weak attacks, and theother is… Heck, you guessed it: it’s the dreaded Meteor Attack. There is simplyno way to escape the deadly spell in this fight, which forces you to adopt acompletely different strategy. Beating Kaisirak is entirely a matter of range:you must position your characters at a specific spot so that they can be bothclose enough to use their attacks and far enough to stay out of the MeteorAttack’s range. This is easier said than done, as we’ll see soon.But beforewe move further, I have to dispel a serious misconception about that fight,namely the notion that Ylenne’s Hell Fire spell is mandatory to beat Kaisirak.This is simply not true at all. Hell Fire is a hidden bonus spell that has thewidest range of all attacks and can cover the whole screen, which makes ittremendously useful against Kaisirak. However, that spell can be found only atthe Mage Academy, a place that becomes unreachable in the latter stages of thegame. Hell Fire is thus a ‘lost forever’ item that can easily be missed, and tomake such a hidden spell mandatory to beat the last boss would be a shockingcase of fake difficulty harkening back to the old ’80s adventure games that nogame would dare endorse nowadays—not even a shameless 8-bit pastiche like Astonishia Story. So indeed,Hell Fire is not mandatory to annihilate Kaisirak. If you don’t have it, threeother long-range spells can replace it perfectly: Rudoug’s Chi Attack, Jenas’Lightning Harken and Ylenne’s Pyra Storm. The safe—and sole— way to proceed isto position these three characters so that their respective spells will justbarely reach Kaisirak. Finding the right spot can require some tinkering, butonce you find it, you’re on safe ground: you will be just far enough not to becaught in the blazing fury of the Meteor Attack and just close enough to castyour spells. The involved area is quite small, so you must proceed with theuttermost caution: move one square too close to Kaisirak and it will unleash adeadly Meteor Attack on your defenseless characters in retribution for yourrecklessness.  With thatmisconception debunked, here’s a quick strategy walkthrough. You start thefight quite far from Kaisirak, which gives you the opportunity to heal yourparty and revive fallen characters if necessary. Don’t bother healing Lloyd orRendalf, though: they don’t play a crucial part in that fight, and it’sactually better to have them dead in order to speed up things. (Akra is notpart of that final fight for reasons that I won’t spoil here.) Then, move yourparty to the middle part of the arena and start crawling carefully upwardswhile trying to cast spells in order to find the perfect spot to stand on. Donot try to approach Kaisirak from the sides: the Meteor Attack’s horizontalrange is much wider than its vertical range, which will lead your party to anunavoidable death. Once you’ve found the correct spot under Kaisirak, take someRed Pepper Powder and start unleashing your spells. You can let Lloyd andRendalf move closer to Kaisirak and pound it at close range until they areannihilated by the inevitable Meteor Attack; when that happens, don’t make thefatal mistake of trying to revive them and keep attacking at long range fromyour place of safety. From that point on, it’s just a matter of patience: usesome Red Pepper Powder to boost your attacks and replenish your MP whennecessary, and you will slowly but surely wear down Kaisirak and ultimatelydefeat it. Well done, you!These willbe my final words on Astonishia Story.I really loved that game, and I’m certainly going to replay it again sooner orlater, especially after having sweated blood to figure out how to emergevictorious from that final showdown. At any rate, I hope this addendum came inhandy. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Astonishia Story: A treat for retro lovers", "date": "11/11/2014", "text": "The retro gamer in me is alive and well andneeds to be fed regularly. My run of Seiken Densetsu 3 was not as fulfilling as I had hoped, leaving me unsatisfied andcraving for a more nutritious retro treat. What I really longed for was a shortand grindy RPG with sweet old-school graphics and as little narrative contentas possible. And it turned out that my mammoth collection contained a game thatperfectly fitted that description, namely the aforementioned Astonishia Story. First, let’s have the usual bit of data. Astonishia Story, or AS for short, is a Korean game developedby Sonnori and released in 2005(ko/jp) and 2006(na/eu) for the PSP. AS is not exactly a brand-new game: itwas originally released for PC in 1994, in Korea only, and subsequently remadefor a Korean gaming system in 2002—the PSP version being a port of that remake.Knowing the game’s origins tarnishes its image somehow: instead of being thetongue-in-cheek homage to the 8-bit era that it seems to be at first sight, itis actually a lazy port of a lazy remake of a game that was already outdated atthe time of its initial release. Indeed, you’d be forgiven for not noticingthat the PSP version of AS is aremake, for it oozes 8-bit-ness through its every pixel. Most reviewers werenot exactly happy with such a lazily retro game, which led AS to be universally panned and reap the shockingly bad scores of 48on Metacritic and 50.76 on Gamerankings. By all accounts, this is a horrendous game;and yet, I totally liked it. I definitely think that AT could appeal to a certain audience, namely the retro gamers wholove their games on the challenging side and really don’t mind a crappy storyline.I’m one of them, and I’m sure that I’m not alone. To all my masochistic retro-diggingcomrades, here’s the perfect treat for you! This game fits our needs oh so verywell, and here’s how. Game,what retro looks you have! Let’s start with the obvious: the presentation,folks. AS is as 8-bit looking as it canbe, from the top-down view to the presence of a world map on which you can moveyour character. (Let’s remember that explorable world maps are very specific tothe 8-bit era: while a couple of 16-bit RPGs would let you roam around on sucha map, like Terranigma and the Dragon Quest series, most of themditched the thing entirely in favour of short segments of land designed toaccommodate the characters’ scale and increase realism.) In a nice nod tomodern times, AS ditches the randomencounter approach on the aforementioned world map and lets you see enemiesinstead. But fear not the dilution of 8-bit-ness, retro aficionados: thedungeons maintain random encounters—with a fairly balanced rate to boot—and theenemies on the world map are so hard to avoid that you’ll be forced to fight agood number of them, willingly or not, as you make your way through the game. The looks are a hit-or-miss: they arebasically 8-bit shapes and patterns that, instead of being pixelated like backin the days, look like they’ve been hand drawn and carefully crayoned withcoloured pencils. I am totally fond of that style, but that is really a matterof taste, I guess. Just like Ys I&II Chronicles, AS bristles withlovely and intricate details, from the people’s crammed interiors to theanimals running and flying all around the place in villages, forests, dungeonsand even on the world map. To see cats and dogs strolling around and birdsnesting in trees in every town is deliciously heart-warming, as well asencountering fluffy white rabbits in forests; on the other hand, discoveringthat you can crush mice to a bloody pulp under your feet if you’re not carefulenough is bound to be a shocking surprise for every player. But the detailgalore doesn’t stop there: while the world map is fairly generic and tends tolook the same throughout the whole game, each and every town has its ownarchitectural style, which is breathtakingly rendered through exquisiteflourishes. The same goes for forests and fighting areas, albeit with slightlyless variations. As for the dungeons, their design is obviously a trifle moremonotonous, but they are still quite distinct from one another and made evenmore alive by the presence of scurrying mice, light beams filtering throughcracks in the walls and various objects. There may have been very little money poured into that game’s development, but there was certainly heaps of love to compensate, and it shows gloriously in that opulence of details.The only thing that harks back more to the 16-bit era than to the 8-bit one is AS’ linearity. The game pushes you dutifully from one place to the next andregularly prevents you from going back to already visited areas, which coulddefinitely be irritating. However, that linearity is handled in a way thatmakes it quite palatable. For one thing, there is not the slightest hint ofbacktracking, which is incredibly refreshing; for another, the presence of theworld map makes you feel less constrained, since you can roam large portions ofland at once instead of going from one town to the next through a single pathin typical 16-bit fashion. Even more interesting, this linearity generates anurgency that can magnify the player’s feelings: you’re on a desperate quest,moving ever-forward, and there is not coming back whatsoever until you’veaccomplished your mission.   Interestingly, AS managed to stir in me a strong feeling of gaming fernweh: an acute desire to be part of the game world and explore itmyself rather than just see it on a screen. I used to experience this kind ofsweet aching wanderlust quite a lot while playing games in my younger years;but I had not felt it for a very long time, and it was quite the surprise to experienceit again. This fernweh was stirred bythe lovely villages and forests bristling with life, the world map teasing mewith unreachable places and the beautiful soft colours of the sceneries, and itfelt wonderful. I’d be curious to know if the ability to elicit such a feelingis a quality inherent to that game, leading other players to experience it whileplaying AS, or if this is just anidiosyncrasy of mine. At any rate, we’re talking about aconfidently 8-bit inspired game here. It may not be an exact visual clone ofthe heavily pixelated games of the ’80s, but it looks and feels like an RPG of that era nonetheless. But the old-schoolgoodness doesn’t stop here: not only does AShas the retro looks, but it’s also full to the brim with good ol’ tropes liftedstraight from the ’80s. Let’s dissect them right now!Game,what retro tropes you have! Let’s start this section with a few wordsabout the narrative, which, in jolly good 8-bit fashion, is quite inexistent. Thestoryline is just a badly crafted excuse to roam the game world: it’s mediocreat best, and more often than not completely nonsensical. Characters make constantad hoc references to events and lore that are never mentioned again, and by thetime you clear the game, you will very likely have forgotten what the point ofyour quest was in the first place. The characters’ interactions are fortunatelymore pleasant, with many light-hearted moments, comical outbursts and sweetbudding romances. There is no character development to speak of, but that’s perfectlyfine: occasional romantic innuendos and random bits of dialogue are all the characterdevelopment that old-timers need in their RPGs. It’s also worth mentioning thatthe game manages to compensate for its narrative mediocrity by being humorousand self-derisive: the Fourth Wall is being broken a couple of times indeliciously absurd and unexpected ways that I won’t spoil here, and the generaltone is definitely light-hearted, with lots of goofy situations and replicas.This may not be the subtler humour ever, granted, but it’s still efficient. I’drather have a crappy storyline that doesn’t take itself too seriously than acrappy storyline that tries to pass for a great one by being annoyinglyserious. With this out of the way, let’s move on tomeatier old-school tropes. It’s fighting time, folks! As you may expect from an8-bit-ish RPG, you’ll spend most of your time fighting, fighting and fightingmore. Apart from the regular exploration bits—i.e. finding your nextdestination or the exit of that dungeon—and the comforting dwelling in thesafety of villages, this game is all about fighting. The fighting system itselfis not especially reminiscent of the 8-bit era, and may very well be the mostmodern feature of AS: it’s agrid-based system with a strong S-RPG flavour that allows characters to movearound in turns and to use attacks with various ranges. The whole thing issprinkled with a touch of elemental complementarities that thankfully deepensmatters a little bit. It’s quite simple in essence, but there are enough rangesand elemental variations to offer a good variety of attacks and make combatpleasant and entertaining. And that’s all for the best, because indeed, youwill be fighting when playing that game. The good old RPG wisdom that dictatesthat you should never shy away from random battles if you want to be properlylevelled-up is alive and well in AS,conveniently enforced by the fact that attempts at fleeing do not alwayssucceed. (There is a special item that allows you to flee without fail,though.) In addition, you may need extra bouts of grinding on a regular basisin order to glean money. Everything costs a hefty price, from the healing itemsto the weapons and armours; and unlike in more modern games, it’s veryrecommended to have the strongest equipment and totally mandatory to havemountains of healing items if you don’t want to be wiped out in the middle of adungeon or a boss fight. Rest assured that there is not risk of sitting on apile of unused money by the time the credits roll; this is old-schoolterritory, and if you want to get some much-needed money, you’ll have to sweatfor it. You’ll have to sweat quite a lot in generalwhen playing AS, actually. This game boastsanother prominent trope of the 8-bit era, which is none other than mighty Difficulty.Interestingly enough, difficulty in ASdoes not take the classic form of sudden difficulty spikes: such occurrencesare completely absent from the game, making way for a difficulty curve thatincreases in the smoothest way and should be easy to ride as long as you don’trun away from random encounters. Instead, the difficulty stems from yourcharacter’s limitations. Here’s a telling example: the game is heavily biasedin favour of MP-consuming attacks—classic, shall we say. Unfortunately, yourcharacters really don’t have that much MP, including the ones that are supposedto be the best magic-wielders. It’s thus not uncommon to run out of MP aftertwo or three random encounters on the field—or even one, for that matter. Level-grinding doesn’t solve the issue atall, since it only grants your characters a fraction of extra MP; thislimitation is very much a design choice, and one that is bound to be presentthroughout the whole game. The only way to circumvent that hindrance is tostock up piles of the resident—and rather expensive—MP-restoring items beforeventuring in dungeons or fighting bosses. (The world map is less dangerous,since the next town is always close by and fleeing from fights is a tadeasier.) This is also true for your HP, albeit to a lesser extent: even themeanest field monsters tend to hit incredibly hard, and seeing your weakestcharacters lose 90% of their HP from a single hit is pretty much routine. Let’salso mention that your party is NEVER automatically healed after a boss fight,even when you’re in the depths of a dungeon and must still cross a mass ofcorridors to find the exit while hanging on to your last HPs. On a morestrategic note, the game often attributes random elemental strengths to enemiesAND keeps their stats hidden from you. As you may imagine, this can easily leadyou to waste some precious MP by unknowingly casting spells that foes areimmune to and trying to figure out which attacks are the most efficient throughtrial-and-error. All in all, the general rule goes as such: while never beingdownright unfair, the game always put you at a slight disadvantage bydefault—and sometimes at a massive one, which leads us directly to the nexttrope in line. Let me ask you this: would an 8-bit-flavouredRPG be complete without a ridiculously long and difficult final boss fight, inwhich all odds are against you? Yeah, you know what I’m talking about: an epic two-phaseboss battle, with no healing in-between and a second phase that pits youagainst a megaboss that can pretty much wipe out your whole party in one hit while yourstrongest attacks hardly make a dent in its HP bar. That’s the pinnacle of8-bit-ness, the cherry on top of the hardcore 8-bit RPG sundae. And it is in Astonishia Story, of course. You didn’texpect less, did you? Indeed, if AShad any modicum of popularity, its ultimate boss battle would probably belegendary by now. I needed no less than five tries to beat the two final bossesof that game, and it took me fortyminutes to do so, despite the fact that my characters were only a couple of levels away from the maximum attainable level in that game—which,incidentally, is Lv.25. This is just ridiculous, it really is, and it’s ablatant case of fake longevity if I ever saw one. And yet, I lapped up thechallenge and felt so incredibly sated and fulfilled when that overpoweredsecond boss died at my hands, making way for a short yet lovely ending. O,sweet joys of the 8-bit era! The thrill of slowly wearing down and finallyeradicating a mighty boss with your infinitely weak party is just incomparable,even more so when it is topped by a sweet ending sequence that makes you feelall warm and fuzzy inside. I will post an addendum especially dedicated to thatintense final boss battle, for there is more to say on the matter. For now,let’s move on!It’s worth noting that while taking itscues from the 8-bit era, AS stillbenefits from three decades of gaming evolution; as a result, it avoids most ofthe pitfalls of early RPG-dom. For one thing, it shows a modicum of welcome leniencyin the saving department by allowing you to save at any moment and load adifferent save while playing, which is quite neat and convenient; in an erathat still gives birth to an infuriatingly high number of portable games withno instant save feature, this is a treat that must be enjoyed to the fullest. Technicalproblems and glitches are entirely averted, and the most annoying thing thatcan happen in that game is to be temporarily blocked by a sprite standing inyour way. The menu system is also much more intuitive than your typical 8-bitmenu, which is quite a relief. Last but not least, a good number of annoyingtropes of the 8-bit era are deflected entirely, such as fake difficulty due tobad controls, lack of information or cheating AI. The dreaded “Lost forever” tropeis present, granted, but with no dire consequences whatsoever, which makes it amere annoyance rather that a serious hindrance. (More on that in the upcomingaddendum.)All in all, Astonishia Story is nowhere near as horrendous as reviews paintedit to be. Granted, it’s a complete throwback to an era that is long dead andgone and as such, it can definitely be panned as lazy and uninspired; however,I had a lot of fun playing it, and that’s the most important part. If you’re adedicated retro gamer with a masochistic streak, a love for grinding and a hightolerance for mediocre storylines, this game may well offer you a couple ofvery pleasant gaming hours. These won’t be my final words on the matter, as theaddendum to that post is on its way. Thanks for reading, and be my guestanytime!"},
{"title": "Seiken Densetsu 3: Tricks of nostalgia", "date": "07/11/2014", "text": "Seiken Densetsu 3. That game single-handedly encompasses thewoes of non-localization. Its name alone evokes years of hope and frustrationmingled, crowned by the most stinging disappointment and followed by an unexpectedwave of relief. Is there any RPG that was more coveted, awaited and revered inadvance in the West than the sequel to the immensely popular Secret of Mana? Seiken 3, or Secret of Mana 2as some chose to call it, followed a very sinuous path indeed to reach ourshores—probably more so than any other game of that localization-unfriendlyera. Oh what an epopeeThe storyis stuff of legend and should sound familiar to most RPG aficionados: in 1995,Square released the sequel to SeikenDensetsu 2 for the Super Famicom. Aptly titled Seiken Densetsu 3, it refined the Seiken formula by introducing a batch of juicy innovations and was highlypraised by gamers and critics alike. The West started awaiting a localizationin eager anticipation: Seiken 2,localized a few years prior under the now legendary name Secret of Mana, had been a smashing success and had become one ofthe most-beloved RPGs of the decade in North-America and—even more so—inEurope. The game was expected to reach us a few months after its Japaneserelease; but to the dismay of all Western RPG aficionados, the months turned toyears without any trace of the coveted Seiken3 on the localization horizon. Square was being cagey and evasive about thematter, and after a couple of years, as the 32-bits systems were soaring in thegaming skies, it became blatantly and painfully obvious that Seiken 3 would never come to the West.   It wouldnever come through the official canals, that is. As the hope of seeing aSquare-approved localization of Seiken 3plummeted over the years, some dedicated teams of RPG aficionados startedworking diligently on home-made translations of Seiken 3. This was in the late 90’s, and the timing was perfectlyripe: the golden age of emulation had just started, allowing North-Americaand—even more so— Europe to catch up with Japan and play all these games thathad infuriatingly avoided our shores during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras. Thefirst translation of Seiken 3 wasmade available on the budding emulation scene in 2000 and was welcomed withopen arms and intense effusions of joy. The mere fact that this game wasfinally reaching us after so many years was nearly a miracle in itself, and Seiken 3 was celebrated, praised and instantlyelevated to a cult classic status.Indeed, Seiken 3 is quite a unique case in thehistory of gaming: this is a game that managed to avoid critique entirely dueto the very special circumstances surrounding its arrival to our shores. When Seiken 3 first reached us throughemulation, it was seen as the prodigal game, coming to our arms at last afterso many years of anxious biding, and most of us were so overjoyed that wedidn’t even think of having our critical eye opened when playing the game. Wesimply wanted to rejoice in the fact that we could play it at long last, andsavour every single one of its hard-earned and well-deserved pixels. Then, asyears went by, retro gaming made its grand entrance: the gamers who had been soprompt to ditch the 16-bit systems in their teens were suddenly looking back onthat era with a wistful eye and using emulation to indulge in these brand-newbouts of nostalgia. The 16-bit era was soon hailed as the golden era of J-RPG,and Seiken 3 was lumped with othergreat games of the time and found shelter under the nostalgia umbrella, despitethe fact that it was technically not played during the 16-bit era anddiscovered only later. I wassmitten just as everyone else when I first discovered Seiken 3 in the mid-2000s. I was in a retro gaming frenzy andcraving 16-bit RPGs back then, and this was just the most perfect treat ever. Icleared countless runs and spent hours experimenting with characters and tryingto design the perfect party. I gazed in awe at the beautiful graphics and listenedto the soundtrack just for sheer aural pleasure. Seiken 3 was granted a very high rank in my RPG hall of fame, and Isaw it as totally perfect and devoid of any flaw. But thatwas before—that is, before I cleareda run of Seiken 3 a couple of daysago, after four years spent without playing it, and finally saw the light. Thisgame does have flaws after all, andvery blatant ones at that. It may well be a cult classic, but it’s a vastlyoverrated one that doesn’t quite deserve the starry-eyed admiration that itelicited since it came to our shores—including from yours truly. Seiken 3 is not the ultimate incarnationof RPG perfection, but rather a very good RPG that has its fair share offlaws—just like any other RPG under the gaming sun. And now that I broke freefrom that game’s spell, I want to analyze it while keeping my critical eye open—instead of closing it to luxuriate in nostalgia as I did before. That undeniable brillianceIf I wantto be critical, I have to be fair while doing so, and give Seiken 3 the praise that it rightfully deserves. Let’s start withthe most blatant qualities: this game’s production values are sky-high, andsimply the best that can be found in the 16-bit era. Seiken 3 is undeniably the most beautiful SNES RPG ever created,with gorgeous graphics, vibrant colours and incredibly detailed charactermodels. And let’s not even mention the stellar Hiroki Kikuta soundtrack, withits dozens of tracks borrowing liberally from the whole musical spectrum andmixing boldly martial music and lounge jazz. Gee, what an ear candy! And ofcourse, it also has the Mana charm in spades: that very special, unique andunmistakable atmosphere that no RPG series ever managed to emulate. It’s hardto describe in words, but it can be identified at a glance. The Mana charm isone of Square’s most brilliant creations and they certainly infused massiveamounts of it into Seiken 3, toenchanting results. Visual andaural beauty is all well and good, but Action-RPGs live and die by theirfighting systems. And once again, Seiken3 hits the mark with gusto: its fighting system is quite excellent,blending elemental complementarities, tons of cleverly designed battle itemsand special attacks en masse. It is all the more brilliant as it manages toimplement with great success the two trickiest features to implement inAction-RPGs: Magic and Allies, ladies and gentlemen. The magic system is atreat to use, with its gorgeous animations and its variable range allowing youto target either one or several enemies. As for the allies, not only can theytake care of themselves and avoid getting killed, but they are also a real helpin all fights, which is an occurrence so rare that it should be celebratedprofusely. But the ally goodness does not stop here, for the game also allowsyou to switch between your characters at will. This is both incredibly usefuland pleasurable, since it gives you the possibility to micromanage your team onthe fly as well as the opportunity to indulge in different fighting styles. Character combinationand progression is another feature that’s incredibly well-handled. It’sprobably hardly a secret anymore that Seiken3 lets you choose between no less than six characters, each one boastingtheir own personality and backstory. The paths of these six interconnectthrough the game in a wonderfully well-crafted way: the lucky ones belonging toyour party will play a major part in events, and the three others will befeatured in various cameos throughout the story. Square didn’t push theenvelope as far as creating six distinct storylines for all six heroes, though:the characters somehow go by pairs, each pair sharing a similar unfolding ofevents and ending as well as a special bond that will lead to a lot of chattingtogether if they end up in the same party with one of them being the leader.(Incidentally, here are the pairs: Duran/Angela, Riesz/Hawk andKevin/Charlotte.) But the combination galore does not stop here: Seiken 3 extends it to the progressionsystem by giving you access to a staggering array of character classes that canbe combined at will, allowing you to create the tailor-made party of yourdreams. As you may imagine, each class has its own set of abilities as well asa general focus, ranging from pure damage dealers to healers, withoutforgetting the good ol’ buffers and debuffers. This is all fairly classic RPGfare, granted, but it remains efficient and pleasurable nonetheless, especiallysince Square went to great lengths to make all classes distinct and unique byallotting exclusive attacks and magic spells to each one. This gives the gamean enormous replay value: no matter how many times you play it, you will alwaysget a slightly—or radically—different experience thanks to that deliciousplethora of character and class combinations.  Last butnot least is the game structure, which is quite unusual. Seiken 3 starts off in a fairly classic way, with the narrativegently pushing you from place to place in a display of linearity typical of the16-bit era. The way is always clear and straightforward, there is a bit ofbacktracking here and there for good measure and the game slowly expands yourhorizons by granting you various travel means, first through the oceans andlater through the airs. Typical 16-bit fare, indeed. But then, something weirdhappens: around the halfway mark, the narrative takes a huge step back and thegame unexpectedly morphs into a pure dungeon-crawler. You’re presented witheight dungeons packed with enemies to scour and cleanse from the boss lurkingin their depths, and the order in which you tackle them is left to yourdiscretion. This a major rupture in the game and a very bold move: altering thepace and general feel of the game so dramatically after the first half wasdefinitely a risky endeavour that could have alienated many a player—andprobably did so to some extent. However, in an RPG landscape where blueprintsand tropes are shamelessly reused until they’re torn and tattered, anyvariation is more than welcome, and kudos must be handed to Square for takingchances and experimenting with Seiken 3. Indeed, Seiken 3 is a massive experimental feastat its core. It’s pretty obvious that Square were bent on trying new thingswith that game: they introduced original features by the truckload and pushedthe envelope as far as they could—or dared. On top of the features that I justmentioned, there is also the real-time day/night cycle, the weekly calendarthat reinforces or weakens your elemental magic abilities, the presence of awhole range of items designed for buffing, debuffing and increasing yourelemental strengths, and so on. And while most of these features are smoothlyimplemented and work like a charm, a couple of them come dangerously close tobeing epic failures. Let’s dwell on them now.Seiken 3—exposedAs Imentioned earlier, the huge majority of Seiken3 reviews are starry-eyed eulogies devoid of the slightest mention of aflaw—suspension of criticism is strong with this game, indeed. And yet, thisgame does have flaws, and very blatant ones at that: they may have been glossedover by Seiken aficionados, but theyare here nonetheless. Square did indeed push the envelope a trifle too far insome departments, resulting in some cringing results. One minoryet annoying failure is the class change system. You can change yourcharacters’ class twice throughout the game, respectively at the Lv.18 andLv.38 mark. While the first class change at Lv.18 is easy to trigger and onlyrequire a small prayer in front of one of the Mana Stones littered through thegame world, the second one is a whole trickier affair entirely. Not only is theprayer segment still mandatory, but the characters must also possess a specialitem in order to trigger the class change. This is already annoying enough, andbecomes ten times more so when one discovers that the coveted item can only bedropped by a certain species of monsters present only in a single place in thegame world. To add insult to injury, the drop rate of this special item is notquite 100% AND every class that can be accessed at the Lv. 38 mark has its ownspecial triggering item, which forces you to kill heaps of monsters until youget the items you need to create the party of your dreams. As though all thisannoyance were not enough, the game squeezes an extra step in the process: themonsters I just mentioned don’t actually drop the triggering item itself, butrather a seed that you need to plant in a special pot located in an inn. Theitem will pop up from the seed, and only then will you see if it is the one youneed or not. If not, you guessed it—it’s back to the killing. This process isunnecessarily long and complicated and makes this second class change acomplete chore instead of the celebratory moment that it should rightfully be.It sure is an original way to change classes, but it’s a trifle too originalfor its own good—and for the player’s own. This also leads me to wonder howmuch information about the different classes and their respective abilities wasincluded in the Japanese booklet. The game itself doesn’t contain any kind ofrelevant information about the second class change process, let alone theattributes of each class, and I can only hope that the Japanese manual wascomprehensive in that regard and didn’t let players fumble in the dark and figureout by themselves how to trigger the second class change, nor forced them to createtheir parties at random by withholding information about the different classes.This is all the more crucial as some party combinations can make the game muchharder and put you in a serious bind. As you may have guessed already, I’m speakingfrom experience here. During my very first run, I chose my characters’ classesat random and, unbeknownst to me, created a monster: a party totally devoid ofHealer. The consequences were stinging: I ended up being totally stuck in thelatter stages of the game, dying over and over at the hands of a boss that Icouldn’t beat because I always ran out of healing items before the end of thefight. Talk about frustration!Thisincidentally leads us to the second minor failure, which is the way theleveling-up process is handled. Like many RPGs of the 8-bit and 16-bit era, Seiken 3 regularly and dutifully throwsdifficulty spikes at you. They usually take the form of a super-strong bossthat will wipe out your party in thirty seconds, and as you’d expect, they canonly be overcome by resorting to good ol’ level-grinding. This is all nice andfine traditional RPG fare, and I have absolutely no complaints about that. WhatI do complain about, however, is thefact that the leveling-up is constrained between arbitrary boundaries set bythe game—namely the second class change, which can only be performed at aprecise point in the storyline as I explained above. In other words, you haveto level-grind like in any old-school 8-bit RPG, but you can’t do it to yourheart’s content because the game decided to wallow in that irritating linearityso typical of the 16-bit era. Talk about getting the worst of two worlds! Themost annoying part is that these limitations are not exactly obvious at firstsight, which can lead one to discover them the hard way. You guessed it: onceagain, this happened to me back in the days. During one of my many runs of Seiken 3, I engaged into a crazygrinding marathon early in the game in order to reach that coveted Lv.38, totallyconvinced that the mandatory items for the second class change would startbeing dropped by monsters as soon as my party was ripe for evolution. Alas,this was not the case, and I had to face the crushing disappointment of havinggrinded to no avail, which I was not exactly pleased with. It’s nowtime to expose the biggest flaw of them all, the one that comes dangerouslyclose to being a full-blown deal-breaker: and the mighty flaw, ladies andgentlemen, is the physics. More precisely, the fighting physics. Now, that mayseem like a contradiction: didn’t I write earlier that the fighting system wasbrilliant? Well, I maintain that: the fighting system as a cohesive ensemble ofmechanics is brilliant, clever and well-designed, but has the misfortune ofbeing hampered by the lacklustre physics. And when I say “hampered”, I mean itquite literally, which leads us to Seiken3’s first major failure in physics: for some unfathomable reason, Squaredecided to slow down the walking speed of the characters dramatically as soonas they encounter enemies on the field. This is irritating and clunky at best,and can lead your party to take unnecessary damage at worst. But there is much,much worse. In their hubris, Square decided to push the envelope as far as theycould and to introduce a modicum of strategy in their fighting system bytinkering with the physics. This was a risky move if there ever was one: Action-RPGsare not exactly conducive to deep strategies to start with, and their physics canonly tolerate so much alteration for the sake of strategy before the wholefighting system loses it edge and becomes cumbersome. Most Action-RPGscarefully introduce the strategy element by allotting different ranges toavailable weapons; and while this usually works well, it also systematicallycreates an imbalance between weapons, with some being more comfortable to usethan others and thus preferred. Despite such warning signs, Square though theycould go higher than every other developer without burning their wings, themfools, and decided to shoehorn strategy in their fighting system by tinkeringnot only with the weapon range, but also with the accuracy, the speed and thestrength of the characters. Let’s see how this apocalyptic combo unfolds:—The weaponrange: Since there is neither bow nor hook in Seiken3, all characters have a fairly close range when fighting with weapons,which forces you to be always quite close to the enemy—at the risk of gettingchain-hit. However, this fairly close range boasts some subtle variations:Riesz has the longest range with her spears, while Hawk and Kevin have the shortestwith their close-combat techniques. As for Duran, Angela and Charlotte, theyhover around an uncomfortably imprecise middle range zone and are the mostprone to missing hits due to bad positioning. And since I’m mentioning missedhits…—Theaccuracy: Even delivered from the pitch-perfect distance, your characters’blows can miss their mark for no good reason—except if you count the game’scaprices as a good reason. I already dislike the very concept of missed hits inTurn-based RPGs, but I loathe it witha passion in Action-RPGs. This is bound to steal away a good chunk of the funthat one rightfully expects from a real-time fighting system, and it’s aninfuriating fixture in the Seikenseries that should have been eradicated before it was even born. As you mayexpect, accuracy is not equally dispatched between characters: once again,Hawk, Riesz and Kevin get the best part of the cake, while the other three haveto trudge through fights while suffering the loss of a good portion of theirblows.    —The speed:Characters are blessed—or cursed—with various speeds in the blow-deliveringdepartment. They range from the quicksilver reflexes of Hawk and Kevin, whichallow them to deliver two hits in rapid succession, to the snail pace of Angelaand Duran, who have to wait a good one or two second between each blow.—Thestrength: Last but not least, characters are not equal when it comes to bruteforce, which makes the efficiency of their blows vary greatly. While Riesz,Kevin and Duran can pretty much wipe foes in two neat swings of theirrespective weapons, Hawk has to sweat at trifle more, while Charlotte andAngela have to deliver a million hits before enemies have the grace to die attheir hands. At thispoint, a picture of major character imbalance should have emerged. Kevin andHawk are clearly the most gifted of the bunch and definitely the more pleasantto fight with, while Charlotte and Angela are the absolute worst and can makeall things fighting an absolute misery. Riesz and Duran lounge somewhere in themiddle: they are not exactly a treat to use, but they can get the job donewithout too much hassle. This drastic imbalance is blatant and undeniable: youonly need to pick up characters and play with them a couple of seconds to spotthe very obvious differences between them. And as far as I’m concerned, it’salso a resounding failure. The intention was good, granted, but the executionwas way too zealous and resulted in the creation of dramatically unbalancedcharacters with exacerbated flaws and qualities. The whole fighting system isaltered and tainted by this endeavour, which would not have been the case ifSquare had tinkered a trifle less and made the Seiken 3 roster more carefully balanced. Of course, it could beargued that characters like Angela and Charlotte act as a hard mode of sortsfor the game; however, such an approach is still vastly unsatisfying. This isnothing less than a classic case of fake difficulty due to technical problems:a game should be made difficult by virtue of all the compelling challenges ithas in store for the player—insane boss fights, cut-throat dungeons and thelike—not because of semi-broken physics that the said player must struggle tomaster. Strangelyenough, I can’t remember the physics being a hindrance when I played Seiken 3 in the mid-2000s. On thecontrary, I thought they were brilliant, to the point of praising them in mypost about Sword of Mana. (For therecord, I was so mortified by my misjudgment that I actually edited that postand excised the offending sentence.) However, there may be a very good reasonfor my incorrect assessment of Seiken 3’sphysics: back in the days, I only played with Hawk, Riesz or Kevin, who areblessed with physics ranging from good to excellent and provided me with a lotof fun in all things fighting. On the other hand, I selected Angela for myrecent run, which allowed me to witness the full extent of the physics’ misery.Fighting with Angela in close combat was actually so unbearable that I resortedto switching to Hawk as soon as combat kicked in, using Angela only to castspells during boss fights.  Afterrediscovering and reassessing Seiken 3,I’m not quite sure anymore that this game qualifies as a true cult classic. Thecircumstances of its arrival on our shores certainly elevated it to such arank, but it’s a trifle too flawed to be a cult classic by sheer virtue of itsactual content. I would rather describe Seiken3 as vintage: this is a game that firmly encapsulates the spirit of a gamingera, a developer and a series, and it does so in a most charming and beguilingway. It has the graphical zest of the 16-bit era, all bright colours and softshapes, as well as the kind of whimsical fantasy universe that was so popularin RPG-dom during that time. It also fully embodies Square’s constant hungerfor experimentation and their desire to push boundaries, which was at its peakin the ’90. The results were not always inspired, as Seiken 3 proves it, but they were trying their hardest, and kudosmust be handed to them for that. Last but not least, Seiken 3 is a dazzling piece of Mana charm, an exquisite treat forall aficionados of the series. I’m definitely one of them, and I still love Seiken 3; but I now love it in a wiserand more balanced way, and I’m able to acknowledge its flaws instead of puttingit on a pedestal and gazing at it with eyes full of stars. It may not be a cultclassic after all, but it’s definitely a vintage game, and an excellent one atthat. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Pearl: Sinnoh, revisited", "date": "29/10/2014", "text": "Gee, it seems that I can’t get enough ofgood ol’ Sinnoh, can I? I have at least ten Pokemongames waiting in line to be played, and instead of humouring them, I’m waltzingback to Sinnoh for the third time in five months. Well, blame this on Suikoden Tierkreis: after having endured30 hours of narrative absolutism at the hands of that game, I desperately needed to grind. No more overstuffed storylines, no more cutscenes by thetruckload: just pure, unaltered grinding—preferably in a cozy and welcoming gameworld, for I’m not in the mood to tackle brand-new hardcore grindy games rightnow. (Blame that on the upcomingwinter.) Compensation, I cried thy name—and thy name was Pokemon Pearl. Coming back to Sinnoh was quite a pleasantexperience, shall I say. I didn’t discover it very long ago, but it alreadyfeels like a very familiar place—not as familiar as, say, Koholint Island in Link’s Awakening, but definitely more sothan I expected for a game world that I only crossed twice beforehand. I canonly imagine how wonderfully sweet it must be to play Pokemon games as a child and have the nostalgia factor added to themix—especially since Pokemon regions are so welcoming and comforting to startwith, which was not exactly the case of Koholint Island. Thefeline runMy initial plan for my Pearl run was a Glameow Solo Run: I was thrilled by the idea ofclawing my way through Sinnoh with that aloof purple feline and couldn’t waitto see it expand to massive proportions at the lv.38 mark. Alas, that was notmeant to be: unbeknownst to me, that plan had no chance of materializing, forGlameow is a Pokemon that can only be recruited in the latter stages of thegame—on Routes 218 and 222 to be more precise. Teary and disappointed, I had towave my Glameow Solo Run goodbye and settle for a compromise. The saidcompromise took the form of a Shinx Solo Run, which would evolve into a Shinx/Glameow Duo Run as soon as I could get my hands of the coveted purplefeline. This seemed like a neat endeavour, and I dove into it with gusto.Once again, I gave my trainer the fittingname of Pearl—I think we have a pattern here, indeed—and chose a Piplup as mystarter, with the idea of using him as a convenient HM move wielder after therecruitment of my Shinx. I was rather surprised to discover that myover-excited tsundere best friend was not named Barry in that game like he wasin Diamond and Platinum. Instead, a totally different selection of names wasavailable, none of them sounding pleasant to my ear. I proceeded to give himthe name “Barry” and made an interesting discovery in the process: if you hitthe OK button while no name is written in the name selection screen, the gameattributes the name “Diamond” to the guy. I thought this was a nice Easter egg,and since my own trainer was named Pearl, I decided that this was a veryfitting name indeed and kept it. Out of curiosity, I conducted the same experiencewith my copies of Diamond and Platinum; and it turned out that the littlechap is given the name “Pearl” in Diamondand “Diamond” in Platinum. Nicetouch, Game Freak. (Incidentally, this trick also works for your trainer; butthe names attributed are classic, run-of-the-mill ones, which is far lessinteresting. Oh, well.) Everything went smoothly and according toplan: I recruited a Shinx on the outskirts of Sandgem Town and cruised throughSinnoh with that electric feline, taking down one Gym Leader after the other. Iexpected this run to be very similar to my Piplup Solo Run of Platinum, but things unfolded quitedifferently in the beginning. The Grass-based Second Gym in Eterna City thathad been such a pain with my Piplup turned into a total breeze with my Shinx; onthe other hand, the Rock-based first one in Oreburgh City, which was meregravel on the road for my Piplup, was a painful trudge for my Shinx. Of course,this all boils down to elemental complementarities, and I’m quite delighted tosee that I’m starting to identify and remember them more clearly after threeleisure trips through Sinnoh. When I finally reached Route 218, Irecruited a Glameow without too much hassle, to my great delight. I tried tostart battling with the lithe feline right away, but the fights were annoyinglydifficult compared to the walk in the park they had become with my overpoweredShinx—who, by that time, had evolved into a proud Luxray. I thus amended my plans once more: I equippedmy newly recruited Glameow with an Exp. Share so that she would gain levelswithout having to fight and forged ahead with my pleasantly strong Luxray. Thenewest version of my plan involved trying to tackle the Elite Four with my twofelines together, and then with each one of them individually if the duoattempt worked out. I reached the Elite Four headquarters without a hitch andstarted clawing and scratching my way through it, confident that the Lv.68 ofmy Luxray and Glameow-turned-Purugly would give me a good edge over the EliteFour ‘Mons, who were hovering around the Lv. 58 mark. Alas, the edge wasdefinitely not sharp enough: after a couple of painful failed attempts, itbecame abundantly clear that my two felines were not strong enough to conquerthe Elite Four together, let alone single-pawedly. Some grinding was mostdefinitely required if I wanted to become the new Champion; but the thought ofgrinding in Victory Road was so painful that I cowardly decided to give upinstead. This taught me that a Solo Run can be carried all the way through onlyif the involved ’Mon garners all theexperience from the fights. My Glameow didn’t take part in a single fight untilI reached the Elite Four heardquarters, so my run was technically Solo untilthen and went quite smoothly; however, the experience share that my Glameowreaped from fights sapped the progression of my Luxray, enough so to compromisemy chances of tackling the Elite Four right away and without extra grinding—whetherit be with one feline or the two of them. The effects of that experiencesharing were actually quite drastic: while my Piplup had reached a lofty Lv. 90when we crossed the Elite Four Headquarters’ threshold in my Solo Run ofPlatinum, my Luxray and Purugly were only at a mere Lv.68, which was definitelynot enough to breeze through the challenge. Well, be it. It was a well-learnedlesson that I will put to good use in my next Solo Runs of Pokemon entries. Dippinga toe in Nuzlocke watersAfter that interesting confirmation thatthere is indeed no room for two in a Solo Run, I was still in the mood for somePokemon action. I thus decided to trymy hand at the Nuzlocke challenge, which had been tempting me for quite sometime. I dutifully stuck to the classic rules and added a few extra ones forgood measure:—Following the Trainer ID last number rulefor the choice of my Starter: 1-3 for Grass, 4-6 for Fire, 7-9 for Water, 0left to my discretion.—Having the Battle style on “Set”—which Ialways did anyway in order to shorten battles.—Not using Battle Items and not making my’Mons hold Berries—which I usually forget to do anyway. —Not running away from random battles.—Not healing during battles, except if theopponent uses healing items, in which case I could use a similar one—includingBerries. I was initially planning to rely only onPokemon Centers for healing, but I gave up as I realised that this would makeme lose a tremendous amount of precious time during the levelling-up process byforcing me to go back and forth constantly between town and field—not tomention that such a choice would render my ill-earned cash totally useless. Iwas considering doing the opposite, i.e. not using Pokemon Centers and relyingsolely on healing items; but the idea of navigating the menu to heal every ’Monindividually felt a little too close to a chore for my comfort, and I finallydecided to make this first Nuzlocke run lenient as far as healing was concernedand to rely on both healing techniques. And so began my Nuzlocke epic. Randomnessdictated that I should select a Piplup as my starter, and I happily complied,before making my way through a Sinnoh that was suddenly much less welcoming andforgiving. I failed to capture any ’Mons on Routes 201 and 202 and was nearlywiped out by the first two Trainers I met on Route 202, whom I fought in a rowwithout healing in-between: when I emerged from that ordeal, I was literallyhanging on to my last HP point. Truestory, folks. Overjoyed and incredibly proud of my amazing survival feat, Imade my way to Jubilife City without too much extra hassle. But the elation wasnot meant to last: as soon as I set foot in town, my Piplup was wiped outduring a fight against a pupil at the Trainer’s School; and since I had failedto recruit any other ’Mon, my trainer blacked out—in Nuzlocke words, game over.Gee, what an epic failure! Of course, I was not going to give up thateasily: my competitive streak had been stirred, for better or worse, and Istarted another playthrough right on the spot. Randomness dictated once againthat I should start the game with a Piplup, and I’m definitely starting tothink that I share some kind of mystic connection with that Water Starter. Atany rate, I dutifully complied and this second run unfolded in a moresuccessful way: I managed to recruit two ’Mons on Route 201 and 202, survivedthe Trainer School in Jubilife City, earned the first Gym Badge in Oreburghquite easily thanks to my Piplup and reached Floaroma Town. It was in thislovely blooming town that I took the ominous decision to give up on that run,despite the fact that it was sailing quite smoothly. The reason was quitesimple: with a Piplup, a Starly and a Shinx, my team was virtually a copy-pasteof the one that I recruited in my run of Diamond.This all boiled down to chance, obviously, but the results were the same: Iended up with a team that I already knew fairly well, which was not what I had signedfor. Had I started with a Chimchar or a Turtwig and recruited a Bidoof and aKricketot instead of a Starly and a Shinx, the face of my run would have beenchanged drastically; and to be honest, I contemplated erasing my file andstarting anew a third time. However, I had gotten my fill of Sinnoh already, after a 20-hours-long Solo Run and two attempts at Nuzlocking my waythrough, and I decided to pack up and leave that lovely region for thetime being. That being said, these small bites ofNuzlocke Challenge were absolutely scrumptious and left me craving for more.This is a tremendously fun and compelling way of playing that radicallytransforms the whole Pokemonexperience and gives a vibrant new intensity to that usually indolent series:danger looms around every corner on previously quiet Routes, every fightthreatens the very existence of your run, and the first encounter in every newarea suddenly becomes an event of huge magnitude in lieu of the barelyregistered occurrence it usually is. I could feel a brand-new shiver ofanticipation every time the familiar battle music started after I set foot in anew Route and a vivid pang of disappointment when the coveted ’Mon broke freefrom the Pokeball. Oh, the thrill! This was a fantastic experience, and I’mmost definitely going to try the Nuzlocke Challenge with a different set of Pokemon games in a not-to-distantfuture. So, after having scoured Pearl to my heart’s content, I’m now biddingSinnoh farewell. It will probably be a while before I go back there: I’m noweager to move to new pastures and to discover other Pokemon regions, and I havemore than enough material to satiate these exploration urges. I cannot say forsure which entry my gaming instinct will elect next, but I’m confident that mynext Pokemon run will happen quitesoon indeed. For now, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Suidoken Tierkreis (2): The most mediocre gameplay of them all", "date": "25/10/2014", "text": "After I abundantly praised Tierkreis’ amazing narrative in my last post, it’s time to pore over less glorious aspects of the game. I won’t wastetime introducing what these aspects are: if Tierkreis’narrative was indeed stellar, its gameplay is the most mediocre, dull anduninspired piece of game mechanics I’ve seen in a long time. Not only does thisgameplay have the fearsome power of boring the player to tears, but it also managesto completely wipe out the exploration thrill and the glorious sense of freedomthat make RPGs so compelling in the first place. This kind of offense hasbecome all too common in story-driven J-RPGs lately; and while it used toaffect mostly home console RPGs, Tierkreissadly shows that portable RPGs are no longer safe and protected from thisinfamy. I strongly feel that story-driven J-RPGs could greatly benefit from adifferent approach to both gameplay and narrative, and I’ll expand on that onceI’ve given a good grilling to Tierkreis’mediocre gameplay. (This intro may sound a tad negative, but fear not: thispost will end up on a positive note, like most of my posts. After all, I didsay that I loved this game, didn’t I?) Couldit be any more boring? I was utterly shocked to discover howlittle actual gameplay there is in Tierkreis.The game’s storyline is a pure gem, that much is undeniable, but it’s alsoinvasive and overbearing to the point of becoming oppressive. It steals thegameplay’s thunder almost constantly: Tierkreisis first and foremost a massive narrative feast that incessantly shovescutscenes up your retinas and never lets you dive fully into the gameplay. Tomake matters worse, you hardly ever do something truly meaningful in that game:not only are the gameplay segments pitifully and frustratingly short, but thereare also of the most boring nature imaginable. Here’s a revelatory example,which I will call “The Great Hall Bore”: you come back to your headquartersafter a so-called “mission” —i.e. a scripted segment loaded with cutscenes—onlyto be welcomed by yet another cutscene informing you that something hashappened and that you must meet your troops in the Great Hall to discuss thesituation. You’d think that after having interrupted the flow of the gameplayevery thirty seconds with cutscenes during the last half-hour, the game would havethe courtesy to take you directly to the aforementioned Great Wall, wouldn't you?Heck, no! It saves that most boring task of crossing half of your headquartersand climbing three floors to reach the Great Hall for you, the player. Andguess how many times you have to meet your troops in that accursed Great Hallthroughout the game? Here’s a clue: way too many. Since I mentioned the missions, I might aswell expand on how dreadfully dull most of them are. The recruitment missionsusually involve going to a certain place, talking to the coveted character andthen coming back to your headquarters with a new member added to your roster.Does it sound boring? That’s because it is. But there is worse: some missionsare purely and simply devoid of any content. Despite the fact that theirdescriptions seem to involve performing an action, the only real thing you haveto do to fulfil them is to let a given amount of time pass. And how do you maketime pass? By running around on the word map—which, en passant, is nothing morethan a lacklustre drawing with a few locations pinpointed here and there, onwhich the Hero runs following dotted lines. The whole process is so insipid andlifeless that I nearly want to cry in misery. It shouldn’t surprise anyone that thedungeons are utterly soulless too. They are not even full-fledged dungeons tostart with: let’s rather call them “these rare areas where the game lets youregain control at last”. No, wait a minute; such a name could make them seemlike a relief of sorts, which they are not the slightest bit. A more fittingname would be “The areas you have to trudge through to trigger the nextcutscene in line”. Yes, that is exactlywhat these places are. For one thing, they are anaemic, each of them containingjust a couple of screens. For another, they are poorly designed, abusing deadends and uninspired camera angles and boasting a level of utter emptiness thatno RPG should be allowed to endorse nowadays. To add insult to injury, theyhave an infuriatingly high random encounter rate—undoubtedly to hide the factthat they are so microscopic. The crossing of such areas should provide moments of much-needed freedom that let you explore toyour heart’s content and experiment with your characters; instead, it is themost dreadful chore of the game, a painful trudge filled with random encountersevery three steps. What a missed opportunity, indeed. All this dullness is already bad enough,but this is unfortunately not the biggest failure of Tierkreis’ gameplay. Wait! I hear you cry out, what can possibly beworse than a boring gameplay? Well, I’ll tell you: a boring gameplay onrails.  Do Ieven need to be there? To put it bluntly, Tierkreis is a game that basically plays itself, using the playeras a cutscene-triggering lackey. Since its very inception, the holy realm ofRPG has been governed by an implicit golden rule that goes as such: the player must feel strongly that their actionsare shaping the narrative. The storyline has to unfold exclusively through theplayer’s input, following the pace that suits them best. All RPGs, even themost linear ones and the ones that abuse backtracking, strive to carefullycraft the illusion that the Hero, controlled by the player, is writing historyas buttons are pushed and quests cleared one after the other. Or rather, nearly all RPGs: for Tierkreis shatters this golden rule topieces and chooses instead to very openly coerce the said player into the narrowpath dictated by the storyline, to an extent and with fervour that I’ve neverencountered before—and that I fervently hope never to encounter again. Indeed, this game gives you the mostunpleasant feeling that the storyline is writing itself and dragging you alongthe way. You’re basically at the game’s beck and call, jumping when it tellsyou to jump and clearing whatever boring task it throws at you; and you’re notdoing that because the game manages to make you feel that it’s your duty as thehero, but because you simply don’t have anyother choice. To make sure that you do its bidding, Tierkreis has a bunch of unfailing constraining techniques that ituses profusely. Lo and behold, here’s the accursed list: —The composition of your party is often predefined,to an extent that’s way too large for comfort. I can understand that the Hero’spresence is mandatory, but does the game really need to force one or two otherunmovable party members on me, occupying two or three of the four slotsavailable and severely curtailing my opportunities to experiment withcharacters? As you’d expect, this all boils down to narrative consistency,which is just frustrating. Why give me the opportunity to recruit so manycharacters if I can’t use them to my heart’s content?  —The locations on the world map appear onlywhen the storyline dictates that the time is ripe to explore them. Before that,the map basically looks like a blank slate. This is bound to kill any thrill ofcuriosity and wonderment that could have been born in your soul from staring atremote places with exotic names and looks, and it’s incredibly patronizing toboot. Give me a break, Konami: I’m not an innocent child that needs to besurprised and entertained by the sudden appearance of new locations—especiallywhen the said locations are so few and so utterly generic to start with. —The game prevents you from returning tosome places at some points, on the basis that the storyline doesn’t require youto go there or forbids you to do so. I really, really hate when games do that. Am I the bleeping Hero acting on his ownfree will here or not? Oh, wait: actually, I’m not. I’m the game’s puppet, andthat’s the whole problem. —Last but certainly not least, perish thethought, Tierkreis often forbids youto leave an area until you’ve clearedwhat you’re supposed to do there. I can’t find the words to express how muchthis infuriates and maddens me. This is insultingly patronizing, and thescolding comments made by your party members when you try to leave these accursedareas only add fuel to the fire of my wrath. To increase my ire even more, Tierkreis uses a totally archaic systemof save points and is utterly stingy with allocating them. Can you see theoffense looming on the horizon? Heck, you guessed it: some of these places areentirely devoid of save points, which forces you to clear them right here andnow lest your progress be lost. (Can you hear my teeth grinding like crazy?) I loathe Tierkreis’ patronizing ways; I really do. But there is more toabhor: not only does the game actively coerce you into doing its bidding, butit also makes sure that any endeavour to rekindle your freedom is utterlypointless. And what better way to do so than by attacking one of the mostprominent symbol of freedom in RPG and sucking every purpose out of it, turningit into a mere futility? You guessed it, ladies and gentlemen: they madelevel-grinding useless. Tierkreistaunts the player with its random encounters, making them believe that thevirtually unlimited avenue of level-grinding freedom will be preserved atleast, and then pulls the rug from under their feet by shoving in their facehow totally futile and pointless it would be to even think of grinding forlevels. See for yourself the extent of this game’s callousness: —Predetermined progression: The variousmagic abilities wielded by your characters are not acquired as they gain levelslike in any other RPG under the gaming sun; instead, these abilities aregranted to them when some milestones in the storyline are reached, regardlessof the characters’ levels. While this design choice ensures that all members ofyour large roster remain properly balanced, it also totally kills anymotivation to level-grind in Tierkreis,trampling your last hope of getting a relief from the ubiquitous,all-encompassing storyline. —Unwinnable boss fights: Is there anythingmore discouraging, disheartening and pointless than a boss fight that you haveno chance to win? Such occurrences shouldn’t exist in the first place. Ever. This is the supreme negation ofthe very act of gaming and the most potent offense that a game can commit. Idon’t care that it serves a narrative purpose; if I have no chance whatsoever towin a boss battle despite my level 99, then don’t let me fight in the firstplace and serve me a cutscene instead, you stupid game. Jeez, it’s not like you’renot soiling yourself with cutscenes already.  In the end, Tierkreis’ gameplay is an epic failure. As I played its short andboring segments, I often felt more eager to reach the next cutscene in linethan to keep doing what I was doing; and as a whole, discovering the narrativewas by far the most pleasant part of the game. This is just so wrong. This is something that should never happen when playing an RPG. Nomatter how excellent Tierkreis’ orany other RPG’s narrative may be, it should under no circumstances be moreenjoyable than the gameplay. Ever. The saddest part is that despite all myranting and fuming about it, Tierkreis’gameplay is not even mediocre per se. Itis actually a fairly competent gameplay that has the supreme misfortune ofbeing rendered mediocre by theoverwhelming presence of the narrative—or, more precisely, by its lack of cohesionwith the narrative, which is an affliction that struck many J-RPGs of late andthat I will now examine more closely.CanI please get my freedom back? Indeed, what is Tierkreis at its core? It’s a bunch of old-school RPG features plasteredwith a complex storyline. Or, if you prefer, it’s a complex storyline pepperedwith old-school RPG gameplay segments. Such an assemblage may look promisingseen from afar: after all, one could think that pairing a good, solidold-school gameplay with a rich storyline would give us the better of twoworlds, right? Alas, it’s not that straightforward. Tierkreis is a perfect example of the struggles encountered by J-RPG as itmoves from its old-school roots to more modern templates, meandering andgetting somewhat lost in the process. Nowadays, many Japanese developers feelcompelled to include incredibly intricate storylines and character developmentby the truckload in their RPGs. Such narrative extravaganza is told throughdozens—if not hundreds—of cutscenes that nearly always give the feeling thatthey’re barging into the flow of the gameplay and severing it in the mostunpleasant way. The reason why they feel like intrusions and hindrances ratherthan welcome developments is quite simple: in most cases, either due tolaziness, shortage of funds or lack of imagination, developers put together anold-school RPG gameplay and then shoehorn their narrative into it. Thisproduces games in which the gameplay and the narrative are totally disjointedand sap each other rather than support each other, and Tierkreis is the perfect encapsulation of this process. Such amarriage cannot work, due to the very nature of the old-school gameplay basedon grinding, exploration, turn-based random battles and the like: this kind ofgameplay was designed to maximize freedom and give room for experiment,customization and micro-managing. As a result, it cannot accommodate a complexnarrative, which is by nature encompassing, directive and invasive. This is a lose-losesituation if I ever saw one: the player cannot fully enjoy the level of freedomthey expect from the gameplay because they are constantly pushed around andinterrupted by the narrative, nor can they fully enjoy the narrative, which istoo stretched out and intercut with gameplay segments to be truly gripping. Andlet’s not even talk about the pacing: Tierkreisand all its story-driven cronies won’t let you fall into the comfortable andslightly obsessive rhythm generated by grinding, nor will they let you relaxand allow yourself to be carried away by the story. This incapacity to design a harmonious andseemingly organic blend of gameplay and narrative, in which the two completeeach other rather than cancel out each other, is the biggest failure ofstory-driven J-RPG as a genre. Fortunately, it’s not an irreversible one: witha good dose of patience, brain-racking and gusto, it should certainly bepossible to design a story-driven RPG in which the gameplay and the narrativefeel like a natural extension of one another. In fact, some games alreadyachieved that goal: Riviera masterfullytied the outcomes of its storyline directly to the way the gameplay isperformed, and my beloved Avalon Codeis blessed with a gripping narrative that modifies the gameplay in major and incrediblyoriginal ways. We can only hope that more games will follow their example inthe future and that cutscene-laden J-RPGs with disjointed gameplays will slowlydisappear, and be ultimately seen as nothing more than meanders that the genreneeded to go through to find its way. There is even some hope for Tierkreis, actually. Sure, it’s alreadyout there and cannot be altered, but considering it from a different angle canhelp one ease their way through it. If you approach that game as a massive visualnovel with old-school gameplay segments, it suddenly becomes much morepalatable. In fact, I could nearly believe that this was Konami's plan from the get-go and that Tierkreis is indeed a visual novel based onthe Suikoden universe rather than anRPG—if not for the fact that it is far too long, does not have different routesand features still a trifle too much gameplay to pass for a visual novel. Oh,well.Despite being three hours into my secondplaythrough of Tierkreis, I won’tclear it now and will instead shelve the game for the time being. I want topreserve what little replay value it may have, and the 30 hours I spent on myfirst playthrough left me sated already. A summary of my run would bepointless, since Tierkreis is thekind of game that unfolds in the same way for all players: suffice it to saythat I ended up with 48 Stars out of the 108, and it was already much more thanI could use. So, I’m done with Tierkreis for now. I loved that game, I truly did; anddespite hating its patronizing ways, I would still recommend it to anyone wholove their RPG stuffed with a compelling narrative and charismatic characters.I will probably come back to it one day, if only to gain a new insight into thestoryline; but for now, I’m moving to freer pastures with a huge sigh ofrelief. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Suikoden Tierkreis (1): The most stellar narrative of them all", "date": "16/10/2014", "text": "Suikoden… I wonder: am I the only one who tends toread the name of this game series ‘SuiDoKen’ instead of ‘Suikoden’? I’m notparticularly dyslexic, but this just feels so much more natural, somehow… With thisdisclaimer out of the way, let’s talk a bit about that tongue-twisting series,shall we? Developed and published by Konami, Suikoden—or Gensou Suikodenas it is known in Japan—is a loose adaptation of the Chinese novel Shui Hu Zhuan, reprising most notablyits enormous roster of characters and remolding said roster in imaginative andfanciful ways. The first installment was released in 1995 for the Playstation,and all entries ever since have taken place in the exact same universeintroduced by that first game. The Suikoden series is most famous for its unflinching narrative continuity: characters returnfrom one installment to the next and the overarching narrative and mythology ofSuikoden’s world is expanded andfleshed out as games are released. This makes the series a hard sell forplayers who missed the first entries; on the other hand, thanks to dearinternet, it’s always possible to catch up and absorb the knowledge one needsto understand and enjoy these games to the fullest. The series’ most prominentfeature is undoubtedly the so-called ‘108 Stars of Destiny’: 108 warriors withvarious abilities that you can recruit to help you fulfill your quest. As youmay rightfully imagine, recruiting all 108 Stars grants you some bonus andaffects the end of the game in a positive way. Unlike other features of theseries that I won’t enumerate here, the 108 Stars are present in every single Suikoden game ever released, includingthe spin-offs. Thespin-offs, yes. Despite being the kind of series that should normally onlyallow for canon entries, Suikodenactually counts two spin-offs:  theJapan-only Genso Suikoden: TsumugareshiHyakunen no Toki for the PSP and—you guessed it—Suikoden Tierkreis, released in 2008(jp) and 2009(eu/na) for theNintendo DS. Suikoden Tierkreis doesnot take place in the canon Suikodenworld, but rather in one of the numerous parallel worlds that constitute the multiversein which the series takes place. As a result, it features exclusive charactersand does not reintroduce a single face from others games in the series, whichmakes it the perfect game for a Suikodenbeginner. Also, ‘Tierkreis’ means ‘Zodiac’ in German, and that’s how I willrefer to that game from now on for the sake of brevity. I mentionednot so long ago that I preferred my RPG to be light on the narrative side, andit’s really like the universe wanted to take the piss out of me by suggestingme to pick up that game, for Tierkreisprecisely belongs to that modern brand of cutscene-laden, story-driven RPGsthat became the dominant trend in the home console RPG landscape in the lastyears. Such games are not exactly favourites of mine: while I don’t outrightdislike them, I usually need a ridiculous amount of time to sink into them andenjoy them fully. Tierkreis was noexception, and it took a good eight hours littered with fleeting thoughts aboutquitting before I became really engrossed with the game and eager to pursue theadventure. And dear, don’t I regret my perseverance! Tierkreis is a brilliant game that I absolutely loved. However, Ididn’t love it at all times, nor did I love all of it: in fact, it’s fairer tosay that while I love it to pieces, I still detected a good number of blatantflaws. This game is the poster child for J-RPGs’ difficult evolution these lastyears, as I will profusely show in my next post. For now, let’s focus on Tierkreis’ abundant goodness, which liesin its epic, awesome narrative—rightfully so for a story-driven RPG.Tierkreis will make me do something that I don’t usuallyindulge in, namely analyze an RPG’s storyline and spoil it profusely while I’mat it. However, it’s hard to proceed otherwise: not only is Tierkreis’ narrative the game’sunwavering main focus, but it’s also undoubtedly its greatest strength, as Imentioned just above. By ‘narrative’, I obviously mean the main storyline, butalso the characters and the whole atmosphereof the game, which are all craftily woven together to create a encompassingexperience that is mesmerizing and very much worth discovering. Let’s nowexplore this most compelling narrative, shall we? Like stars in the sky First comesthe atmosphere. It’s gorgeous, enticing and mesmerizing, and the graphics aremostly to thank for that. Tierkreisis the perfect example of a game that uses great graphics not to show off andpander to the latest visual trends, but rather to craft a beautiful world boundto make the player gape in awe at every corner—had I followed my impulses, Iwould have stopped playing every two minutes to grab my camera and this postwould be littered with dozens of pictures. Tierkreis’world is not only beautiful but also highly evocative and unique, thanks to alarge degree of stylization. Of course, once again, there is a modicum ofcliché in that game world, which features obligatory areas like a good ol’desert and a snowy mountain and occasionally recycles some scenery elements;but that doesn’t detract from the fact that Tierkreis’world is a highly polished and fleshed out one. Konami went to great lengths tomake sure that this game world felt as real and consistent as possible: forinstance, not only do the characters who join your side can be accessed andtalked to at any given moment, but their lines of dialogue change according tothe latest events. The cardboard cutouts used in most cutscenes are very welldrawn and show a pleasant variety of emotions, and the animated cutscenes arecompletely hand-drawn, which gives a lovely old-school feeling to the game.Next arethe characters. To put it simply, these characters are totally, entirely,completely endearing and loveable. I've not been that fond of characters in an RPG since I played Avalon Code and had a minor crush on Duran, Nanai, Heath, my faithful Spirits and a couple of others; however, that was only a few characters in a larger cast. In Tierkreis, all thecharacters are incredibly endearing, despite being so numerous, and that’s inno small part due to the fact that they are so carefully and lovingly fleshed out.To craft such a large roster of characters, each one with their individualityand distinctive features, is a narrative tourde force if I ever saw one, and massive kudos must be handed to Konami forthat. Not only do these loveable characters all have their own personality,backstory and relationships, but they also manage to avoid being complete J-RPGclichés, which makes them even more loveable. Don’t get me wrong: there is amodicum of anime/J-RPG tropes there, but they are far less potent than in youraverage J-RPG. Take the Hero: instead of being an emo amnesiac with aridiculous haircut, he’s a well-grounded young man with generic short hair, whoalso happens to be a natural born leader belonging to a small brigade devotedto defending his village. The obligatory female sidequick does NOT have theobligatory crush on the said Hero and is not a tsundere trope on legs, butrather a cheerful young woman who’s also part of the aforementioned defensebrigade. The same thing goes for all characters: they incorporateever-so-slight cliché elements (the Hero may not be amnesic, but he was adoptedas an infant and no one knows about his origins, which adds the required doseof mystery to him) yet manage to stray from them sufficiently to feel fresh andoriginal—and most importantly, realistic and believable to a certain extent.This may be the key to their lovability: while it is often hard to relate to anamnesic character with an emo streak embroiled in a quest that they don’t fullyunderstand, especially after having met heaps of such characters in countlessJ-RPGs, a bunch of determined people from all walks of life trying to save whatthey care for is much more likely to strike a sensitive chord in the player,especially the older one.    Thecharacter goodness doesn’t stop there: not only are Tierkreis’ numerous characters totally loveable just by virtue oftheir careful crafting, but most of them can be used in battle, which gives youeven more reasons to love them. Nearly all 108 Stars of Destiny can take partin fights, either as members of the main team or as support members, whichgives Tierkreis a completion vibesimilar to what you can find in the Pokemonseries. Of course, it’s nearly impossible to enjoy the full cast on a firstplaythrough, and many of them have similar abilities, which led to somecriticism: Tierkreis was accused oftrying to artificially inflate itself by throwing heaps of similar and/orunusable characters at the player’s head. However, I feel there is no reasonfor criticism here: collecting the 108 Stars of Destiny is a fixture in the Suikoden series, but it’s not mandatory to complete this game orany other Suikoden game, so fakelongevity is averted here. I see this as a giant buffet of characters, fromwhich you can pick up the ones you love the most; and that choice is not allabout abilities, but also about the characters’ personalities, backstories andlooks. Any game that gives you a wide array of choices in any departmentwithout treading on fake longevity territory is good in my book; this isbasically synonymous of huge replay value, and I rejoice in the thought thatI’ll be able to experiment with totally different characters next time I play Tierkreis.  Stellar storylineLast, butcertainly not least, is the storyline. (And here come the SPOILERS, as you’d expect.)Oh, dear.Where do I start? This is absolutely one of the best storylines I’ve beentreated to in an RPG, hands down. It starts as a routine quest to find explanationsto a couple of weird occurrences happening around the main characters’ villagebefore slowly morphing into a political imbroglio involving a creepy cult called“Order of the One True Way” and a would-be dictator; then the story takes asudden turn for the worse when it is finally revealed that the very existenceof the world is at risk due to a seemingly unstoppable physical phenomenonlinked to a mysterious entity named the “One King”. The progress between thesenarrative milestones is as smooth as it can be, each new element beingcarefully introduced when the time is ripe. Tierkreisis generous with short exposition segments that help you get an instant feel ofthe situation at hand and somehow work better than hour-long expositorycutscenes. The ‘sick man’ segment at Cynas is a telling example: you try to finda doctor to help a man dying at the inn where your party is stationed but areprevented to do so by the innkeeper, who claims such an act would violate theprinciples of the Order which rules supreme in the town. Your party members thentake care of the man themselves and manage to rescue him from death, only tohave the said man blame you for your meddling and claim that his survival waspredetermined and nothing you did could change that, before starting to rambleabout whether he’s been faithful to the Order’s principles or not. This segmentlasts only a couple of seconds yet gives you a full and striking understandingof the locals’ mentality as well as of the obstacles you’re bound to face whiledealing with the Order.Not only isthe story incredibly well told, but it’s also pleasantly realistic. The threatsencountered by the characters are very tangible and ominous and can very muchmake a shiver run down your spine—no doubt because they are inspired byreal-world menaces. Instead of fighting a group of misfits wielding asupposedly powerful crystal or your former teacher who betrayed you to becomeking of the world, you are confronted by a powerful cult with elaboratedbrain-washing techniques, a growing number of countries under its influencesand powerful armies ready to attack at its beck and call. Now that’s what I call a threat. Later, youface the very dissolution of your world, caused by the collapsing of universesonto one another. While this may be a little less tangible as far as our realworld is concerned, it’s not coming entirely out of the blue, since it refersto the physical cosmology theory of the multiverse born in the late 20th century and defended by a number of scientists. This is theperfect transition to the refreshingly simple metaphysics of Tierkreis. Unlike other J-RPGs thatfeel forced to create twisted metaphysical concepts from scratch and give themthe weirdest possible names for good measure, Tierkreis bases its whole narrative and universe on a couple ofconcepts that are incredibly simple to grasp and yet pave the way for somemind-boggling developments. The first one is the “Infinity”, which postulatesthe existence of an infinite number of parallel universes, each one containingits own version of our heroes. The second is the existence of the so-called “Starsof Destiny”, a group of powerful warriors who can wield a form of magicunavailable to mere mortals and have a more important function that is revealedin the game. Last are the “Chronicles”, which are books that compile the wholehistory of every single of the parallel worlds; they are infused with the powerto awaken the dormant potential of the Stars of Destiny, who can then modifytheir content under certain conditions. From these simple concepts, Tierkreis weaves a story that is soincredibly complex yet implacably logical and well-articulated that my mindstill reels when thinking of it. Sure, there may be a few plot holes here andthere, but as a whole, it’s just brilliant. Tierkreis’story belongs to this rare brand of storytelling that prompts you to replay thewhole game immediately in order to see everything in light of what you’velearned in the later stages of the game. As a matter of fact, I did exactlythat, and was shocked to discover that one of the very first events of the gametakes place in a decayed version of the very tower in which you fight the OneKing at the very end of the storyline, which rose even more mind-bogglingquestions. But there is more: if you want to get the whole picture and fullyunderstand the story in all its spinning complexity, you have to witness allthe possible endings. Fortunately, there are only three of them: the GoodEnding, the Bad Ending and the Perfect Ending, which you get when you recruitall 108 Stars. The Bad Ending is triggered by one particular choice at onepoint in the story and is incredibly brief, but it’s nonetheless crucial as faras the narrative is concerned, for—drums rolling— it reveals the true nature ofthe One King! This is actually a shiver-inducing moment that left me struck andgaping as everything fell in place in my head and the whole story took atotally different turn. The Good Ending and Perfect Ending both give hintsabout what the One King is and how they come to life, but only the Bad Endinglets you witness the full process in all its devastating glory, leaving nodoubt about the heartbreaking nature of the One King. Konami could have playedit nasty by saving the big final explanation for the Perfect Ending, but thankfully,they abstained from such roguishness and delivered said explanation in the Good Ending as well. The Perfect Ending only adds a cutscene containinga couple of minor narrative elements—nothing that a quick visit on Youtube can’tprovide quickly and efficiently, saving you the chore of painstakingly collectingall 108 Stars only to get a disappointing extra cutscene as your sole reward.  Will you have a bit of brain-racking?That beingsaid, it’s worth noting that not all the questions raised during a playthroughof Tierkreis are bound to be answeredat the end of the game, even with all the possible endings in hand. Konamiconveniently paved the way for future installments related to the Tierkreis narrative arc by leaving manyof them opened, preserving thus a lot of potential material and large avenuesfor future storytelling. From what I’ve read here and there on the internet,this way of leaving many questions opened and lingering seems to be entirelyintentional and a fixture in the Suikodenseries; the folks at Konami visibly want to craft a complex and compellingfantasy soap-opera, using as many entries as necessary to develop their huge, overarching narrative. However, and that’s where the genius ofthe narrative—and Konami itself— lies, it’s perfectly possible to guess howthings may have unfolded in the past  andled to Tierkreis’ events—and toextrapolate how they may unfold in the future, for that matter—based onelements provided in the game. Even more interesting, Tierkreis actually offers several possible explanations to whathappened over the course of the game, which are all plausible and logical; it’sthus up to the player to pick up the one they prefer, until a hypotheticalfuture installment brings extra elements to the fold and clears matters forgood—or not, since Tierkreis isalready eight years old and no trace of a sequel can be found, not even as avague innuendo from someone at Konami’s. Oh, well. At any rate, I’ll keep myown interpretation of Tierkreis’events shelved until I clear my second playthrough; there are still a couple ofelements that are murky to me and that I would like to clarify beforedelivering my vision of the story. I will edit that post if need be; for now,let’s move on! All literalinterpretations of the story aside, Tierkreis’ narrative very graciously lends itself to other types of interpretations, which is utterly pleasant and makes that already splendid narrative even more excellent and fascinating, if that was possible. The story can be seen from different analytic angles and provides fascinating conclusions for each one, asI’ll demonstrate right now:—The political philosophy angle: Tierkreisbrilliantly illustrates the dangers inherent to any form of leadership. The Bad Ending, andby extension the genesis process of the One King, show that a kind leader withexcellent intentions can still lead his troops to a complete disaster by takingjust a couple of bad decisions. The Stars of Destiny relinquish their freedomand power of decision to follow the one of them who’s a natural-born leader,and that renouncement alone is dangerous, since it’s the first step on a trailthat can ultimately lead to the birth of a brand-new One King. If the Starsremained totally independent, the One King simply couldn’t exist: its mereexistence is a warning against the mirage of an encompassing positiveleadership that could bring happiness to everyone and the illusion thatsacrificing members of the group can lead to a greater good. The only way tosave the world in Tierkreis is to letall the Stars follow their own way and fight their own part of the finalshowdown, after which everyone go back to their land and duties. Tierkreis teaches us that goodleadership is bound to be temporary and must respect the individualities ofevery member of the group, lest a new twisted dictator be born beforeeveryone can say ‘One King’.—Themetaphysical angle: Tierkreispostulates a universe of unlimited freedom, full to the brim with an infinity of potential developments and outcomes. This freedomis embodied by the Stars of Destiny, who are powerful individuals that can haveenough influence on their environment to steer the course of events in acertain direction—or, to be more precise, a portionof the course of events. The more Stars are awakened and active, the morediversified and vibrant the future will become; reduce the numbers of Stars,and the future will slowly merge into a more unified thread, until it becomesstill and encompassing under the dominion of the One King. Interestingly, this recoups quantum physics notionsabout the interdependence of mind and matter and their reciprocal influence onone another: as some Stars disappear, so do the worlds that theycould have helped molding. It also gives a whole new meaning to the Hero’s motto, the deceptively cliché “You’ll never know unless you try”. This sentence that seems to be pure bromide at first sight, copy-pasted from any generic J-RPG under the gaming sun, reveals an unexpected depth upon further inspection and conveys a fundamental truth about Tierkreis’ world: this is literally a world in which the Stars of Destiny (such a perfectly fitting name, indeed) must take action in order to allow for a potential future to materialize. —The moral angle: This is maybe the most cliché of them,because it reprises the old J-RPG credo of “I will decide my own destiny!”However, it’s more palatable in Tierkreisbecause it’s backed up and fed by the other possible interpretations of thenarrative. Following one’s free will, especially if one happens to be a Star ofDestiny, is highly recommended in Tierkreis;but unlike in many J-RPGS, it’s not recommended only on the superficial groundthat freedom is more alluring and glamorous than submission. It’s recommendedfirst and foremost because not doing it can have devastating consequences:there is a moral imperative at work there, and Stars have the responsibility tofollow their own way in order to preserve as many parallel universes aspossible, and thus as many lives as possible. Freedom in Tierkreis does not equate roaming the world with no worries, butrather fulfilling your duties and remaining faithful to the path that only you canwalk. From that angle, Tierkreis' storyline can be seen as a bildungsroman of sorts, a tale of spiritual growth in which the Stars of Destiny slowly discover their own tremendous power and the important responsibilities it entails. When all issaid and done, Tierkreis is the kindof game that makes you think. Itdoesn’t simply offer you a stellar narrative with compelling characters and anenchanting atmosphere, which would already be great; it also offers you thepossibility to draw your own conclusions and interpret its storyline the waythat suits you. This is quite rare in the gaming world and must be enjoyed tothe fullest, and I can’t recommend enough Tierkreis’stellar, shining gem of a narrative. There are other elements in that game thatI wouldn’t warmly recommend, though, and that will be the subject of my nextpost, along with a plea for a much-needed different approach to story-driven J-RPGs. Thanksfor reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Coveted Games: 2014’s glorious end and the puzzling current state of portable RPG-dom", "date": "07/10/2014", "text": "While thefirst half of 2014 was rather quiet as far as RPG releases on portable systemswere concerned, the second half of it is unexpectedly clotted by tons ofappetizing games. A tidal wave of mouth-watering offerings is slated forrelease up until the end of the year, paving the way for a most gloriousChristmas shopping. And since I’m currently busy playing and don’t have anyfinished game to review, I’m going to indulge instead with this generous, yummyslice of filler in which I will survey the upcoming games I covet the most.Enjoy, and don’t hesitate to share your own desired games in the commentsection!   Disgaea 4: A Promise Revisited (Vita): This one is already on the shelvesand is promising to be a smash hit. An enhanced port of PS3’s Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten, it’scertainly going to become one of the jewels in the Vita’s RPG crown, along withhits like Persona 4: Golden and Ys: Memories of Celceta. Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair (Vita): The sequel to the criticallyacclaimed Danganronpa: Trigger HappyHavoc, it’s also already been released, to even greater critical acclaimthan its prequel—which reminds me that I still have to play the said prequel,preferably before I purchase Danganronpa2. (Or maybe it would be better to purchase Danganronpa 2 first and then play the two games in a row? Oh well,we’ll see.)Fantasy Life (3ds): Freshly released, this title promises a lotof RPG goodness. A vast open world, extensive customization and lots of tasksto accomplish at your own pace: what’s not to love, really? Fantasy Life seems to be the perfecthybrid between RPG and life-sim, and I’m really thrilled about it: any gamethat offers a huge amount of freedom and the possibility to follow your ownagenda is definitely bound to pique my interest. Natural Doctrine (Vita): Also freshly released, this oneseems to be a mixed bag. On one hand, it looks promising, with its tacticalgameplay and inventive soundtrack; on the other hand, it’s been criticized forbeing too slow and too difficult, and the graphics and colours look horrendous.Granted, it was designed from the start as a hard game that would force theplayer to streamline their strategies and map out their progression with greatcare, so it succeeded in that regard; but since tough games are not exactly therage nowadays, it sold quite poorly in its home country. That didn’t deter NISfrom publishing it in the West, and it will hopefully turn out to be aninteresting game—especially since SRPG releases have become quite scarce lately. Akiba’s Trip (Vita): Oh dear, that pun… Really? Here is a gamethat flaunts its campiness without shame, and we can hope that it’s as pleasantlyironic and self-derisive as it appears to be at first sight. It’s supposed tobe a mix of RPG and Beat’em Up, and although the reviews leaned on the mixedside, it’s still an intriguing offering that I will probably try at some point.Tales of Hearts R (Vita): Another full-blown RPG, Tales of Hearts R is an enhanced remakeof Tales of Hearts, previouslyreleased on the Nintendo DS. Like all Talesgames, it features a party of weirdly dressed characters, a convolutedstoryline and yet another variation of the series’ trademark fighting system. It’sactually one of the most praised Tales games, and that Vita remake is hailed as even better than the original, which makes it a worthy addition to my precious collection. Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth (3ds): This Persona spin-off is a crossover between the Persona and Etrian Odysseyseries, mixing the characters of the first with the dungeon crawling and chibi art direction of the second. Thisis a seriously attractive proposition, and the fact that it will be released asa special edition pack with a handful of adorable feelies makes it even moredesirable. (I SO want that 3ds case adorned with these cute characters!)Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire (3ds): Need I say more? The twomuch-awaited remakes of Gameboy Advance’s Rubyand Sapphire revamped for the 3ds,all dressed-up in gorgeous 3D and full to the brim with new features. And ofcourse, I’m getting both of them. Freedom Wars (Vita): Built around the fulfillment of missions inorder to reap points and ultimately set your character free from lifeimprisonment, this Action-RPG features an interesting storyline, glossygraphics and gorgeous character art. It was an instant hit in Japan and soldvery well, and it’s now headed our way, as a physical release to boot. And asan Action-RPG aficionado, I’m definitely delighted and very eager to play it. Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley (3ds): This game is slated for release inearly November in North-America; for Europe and Australia, things are a bitmurkier, and an official release date has yet to be confirmed, although Natsumehas announced an arrival on our shores in 2015. Well, we’ll see. Theinteresting thing is, this Harvest Moonentry is actually very different from its predecessors: instead of being a localizationof Marvelous’ Bokujou Monogatari asall Harvest Moon entries before it, The Lost Valley is a game entirelydeveloped by Natsume, sole publisher of all HarvestMoon games in North America up until now and owner of the ‘Harvest Moon’brand name. Marvelous recently decided to excise Natsume from the publishingprocess in North-America and to publish all future Bokujou Monogatari entries through their own subsidiary XseedGames, even though this meant parting with the well-established ‘Harvest Moon’name. On the other hand, Natsume, not so eager to abandon its biggest cash cow,decided to keep milking it as much as possible by creating their own Harvest Moon game—and why not, sincethey own the name and have been dropped so carelessly by Marvelous? We can thusexpect a Harvest Moon game that willbe different from what we’re used to, and it will be interesting to discoverNatsume’s own take on virtual farming after nearly two decades spent localizingthe world’s most famous farming sim. Story of Seasons (3ds): Now, this is the real latest Harvest Moon entry, the one developed by Marvelous and part of the Bokujou Monogatari series. It will bepublished by Xseed Games in North America, supposedly sometime before the endof 2014; no European release date has yet been announced, but we’ll probablyget it sooner or later. (Or maybe not: RuneFactory 4’s cancelled European release showed that we’re sadly not on safeground anymore as far as the publishing of all things Harvest Moon is concerned.) The name change was triggered by copyrightissues first and foremost, but may actually turn out to have a positive impact:not only does ‘Story of Seasons’ sound really good and manages to be much moreevocative than ‘Harvest Moon’, but it also refreshes the series’ ageing imageand could very well bring new potential players to the fold.That’s anexcellent line-up already, and that trail of goodness seems to carry on to theupcoming year. Very promising games are slated for release in early 2015: Monster Hunter 4 on the 3ds, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2, Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters and Criminal Girls Invitation on the Vita,to name only a few. And I must say that I’m highly pleased to see the Vita gettingsome love and attention at last and being showered with heaps of excellentgames. I bought mine nearly as an afterthought and didn’t expect my Vitalibrary to count more than a dozen games; but to my utter surprise and greatdelight, it’s been growing at an exponential rate lately and will continue todo so thanks to all these excellent future releases. On the other hand, I haveto admit that I’m a trifle worried about the current state of RPG-Dom as far asthe 3ds is concerned: nearly four years after Nintendo’s eighth generationhandheld made its debut, I find its library to be still very much devoid ofRPGs—alarmingly so, in fact. Not only that, but the RPG release pace doesn’tseem to be increasing over the years, as it is usually the case: when 2014comes to an end, only a handful of full-blown RPGs will have been released onthe 3ds, and early 2015 isn’t exactly bristling with new and fresh offerings. Couldit be that Nintendo relies a tad too much on the 3ds’ backward compatibility,assuming that the large DS RPG library is enough to sate players’ cravings forthe genre—and forgetting older RPG aficionados who are already quite familiarwith the said library in the process? In the meantime, the Vita is carving outan ever-larger niche in RPG-Dom at a breakneck pace, welcoming tons of quirkydungeons crawlers and hybrid RPGs with open arms. I wonder if there is aconnection between these two seemingly opposite trajectories: did Sonyexplicitly encourage the development of RPGs for its resident handheld whenseeing that Nintendo wasn’t exactly in a hurry to make the 3ds a new RPG heaven?Are they planning to reverse the Vita’s fortunes by transforming thatmuch-maligned system into the eighth generation’s reference handheld for RPGs?If this is indeed the case, then it’s working brilliantly: I’m now consideringmy own Vita with renewed interest, and I’m looking forward to discovering allthe upcoming Vita RPG releases—not to mention all the Vita RPGs that I alreadyown. And of course, there is still the hope that some excellent RPGs will gracethe 3ds before the end of its lifetime; after all, there was hardly any RPG onthe Vita just one year ago, and the 3ds could experience in the future the sametype of deliciously hectic release schedule that the Vita is currentlyundergoing. My, my;writing about these games made me even more impatient to get my hands on them.They will all become part of my precious collection sooner or later, and I’mlooking forward to 2015 and hoping that it will be as excellent a gaming yearas 2014. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Ecco the Dolphin: Easy to love, hard to enjoy", "date": "30/09/2014", "text": "Underwater,no one will hear you scream in frustration.This wasnot Ecco the Dolphin’s motto, but itcould definitely have been. Ecco is aragequit-inducing game—and series—if there ever was one, a game that will makeyou throw your controller at the TV screen and want to suffocate all thingsaquatic under tons of oil. Despite being one of the most famous and distinctivegames of the 16-bit era and being widely recognized as a Megadrive/Genesis gem,Ecco has a sinister reputation: it’sprobably as infamous as it is famous, and it’s a gem most gamers prefer toadmire from very, very far. Ecco the Dolphin elicited curiosity and wonderment from the dayof its release: it was a unique and original game in many ways, starting withits origins. Ecco was published bySega and developed by Hungarian studio Novotrade International—how exotic!—andfollowed a release pattern that was virtually the opposite of what we’re usedto: it was first released in Europe in 1992, then in North-America and finallyin Japan in 1993. Ecco is thebrainchild of developer Ed Annunziata, who had a very potent, structured anduncompromising vision of what his game should look, sound and play like, andmanaged to bring said vision to life in an astounding way. Ecco was an instant hit, and was followed two years later by asequel. Ecco: The Tides of Time, asit is known, picks up the story where Eccoleft it and expands the mythology of the series while introducing a batch ofnew—and unevenly inspired—gameplay mechanics. A third Megadrive/Genesis entrywas planned yet never saw the light of day, supposedly due to somedisagreements between Annunziata and Sega about the game’s concept; instead, aspin-off called Ecco Jr. was releasedin 1995, to general indifference. A 3D reboot was released in 2000 for the Dreamcastand PS2; despite being developed by the same studio, it didn’t involve anymember of the original development team and follows a totally differentstoryline. The canon Ecco series thuscounts two games only, and despite Annunziata’s persistence and repeatedattempts to keep his creation alive, Eccois more or less dead and rotting on a sea bed—for the best, will say some.   Pleasure and painMyrelationship with the Ecco series isa tormented, ambiguous and ultimately bittersweet one, fully encompassed bythis post’s title. Ever since I discovered the series, I’ve been totallyenamoured of the graphics, the music, the atmosphere, the whole concept of it; yet once facing the gameswith a controller in hands, I’ve always found incredibly hard to actually enjoy them. I’ve always derived morepleasure from gazing at Ecco’s screencaptures in gaming magazines and listening to its music than from actually playing the series, and I’d wager thatI’m not the only one in that case.   Let’s behonest: Ecco’s concept andpresentation are mesmerizing. Whether you love it or hate it, this game is aleague of its own: nothing remotely similar had been created before—or since,for that matter. The concept is beautifully bizarre, twisted and quiteotherworldly, in more ways than one: there is of course that specific storylineelement that I won’t spoil in case someone who never played the game readsthis, but also the fact that the ocean is virtually a foreign world as far aswe’re concerned. When I first discovered the games, I loved how exotic thenames of the levels sounded, using unusual words and evoking elusive worlds ofwonder: what on earth—or not—were a ‘vent’, a ‘fault’ and a ‘moray’? And wasn’t‘City of Forever’ just the most beautiful and evocative level name evercreated? On a deeper level, Ecco’sphysics were incredibly innovative: being able to move in virtually everydirection with speed variations in a 2D environment seen from a side view, withthe scrolling graciously accommodating your every fancy, was something unseen andgroundbreaking at the time. The musicbeautifully and nearly perversely enhances Ecco’swonderful weirdness. This is a soundtrack that has gained a mythical aura overthe years: described by some as stellar and by others as nightmarish, it is awondrous and uncanny mix of Pink Floyd and Jean-Michel Jarre that leaves noneindifferent. I’ve been in love with that soundtrack ever since the first timeit graced my ears—a love not exactly shared by my mother, who found it creepyand depressing and lamented about my crappy gaming tastes every time I played Ecco in our living room. That highlydistinctive soundtrack is probably the series’ most polarizing aspect and playsa huge part in making it so enthralling. Would the infamous ‘Welcome to theMachine’ level be so legendary without its fantastically bizarre and hauntingmusical theme? And would a level like ‘Tube of Medusa’ even be bearable withoutits awesome, uplifting theme?  A lesspolarizing facet of the series is its graphical perfection. It’s widelyacknowledged that Ecco and Tides of Times are two of the mostbeautiful and polished Megadrive/Genesis games, if not the two most beautiful games on the system. To get such stellarbeauty out of the Megadrive’s entrails was a tour de force, and one that managed to stand the test of timeamazingly well. The series aged gracefully, indeed, and does not look theslightest bit dated twenty-or-so years after its initial release. Theunderwater backgrounds are as gorgeous as ever and beg to be admired and gazedat wistfully; I swear that the deep shade of blue used for the coral banks stirssomething deep in my soul, and seeing the sandy ocean floors makes me want todive straight there.Yes, I dolove Ecco. I adore Ecco. The problem is, Ecco doesn’t love me back. It’s nosecret that Ecco is tough as nails. Theseries has a ferocious and well-earned reputation in that regard and is deemedone of the most hardcore franchise of the 16-bit era—heck, maybe even of alleras since the dawn of gaming. A merciless combination of touchy jumpingphysics, labyrinthine level designs, nerve-racking puzzles, forced backtracking,harrowing fetch quests and the constant necessity to refill Ecco’s oxygen metermakes the series’ core gameplay highly demanding. Add to this alreadyformidable mix tons of environmental hazards, unclear goals that you mustfigure out all by yourself through trial-and-error, impossiblyhigh/long/precise jumps and respawning swarms of enemies and you get arelentlessly challenging and exacting game that keeps you on your toes at alltimes. Playing Ecco requires nervesof steel and a nearly infinite amount of patience: should your focus waver oryour frayed nerves falter, the retribution will be immediate and brutal. However,the series’ trademark tough gameplay is not the reason why playing Ecco is more often than not utterlyimpossible to enjoy. Most gamers appreciate a good, hardcore challenge once ina while, and a demanding gameplay can make a game incredibly rewarding andcompelling; but Ecco overdoes it and jumps way over the ‘compelling’ mark. The problem is that Ecco is not only difficult—which would be tolerable—but also totallyunfair, which is plainly unbearable. It’sunfair because it punishes you brutally for the slightest slip without everacknowledging any of your progress or achievements; to put it bluntly, if gamescan be abusive, then Ecco is thefullest, most perfect encapsulation of it. This abusiveness is all due to thesaving mechanics: there is neither an instant save system nor check points inthe Ecco games, only a passwordsystem; this basically means that should you die at some point in a level, youwill have to restart that whole level from scratch, all your prior efforts andtoiling reduced to nothing. (Having to restart a fetch/escort quest after dyingtwo meters away from the exit in Eccois a soul-crushing experience and probably one of the worst torments that canbe inflicted on a gamer. I still want to weep when thinking of it.) Even worse,you are occasionally sent back to the beginning of the previous level; if this is not pure sadism, I don’t know what thisis. (Having to redo ‘Welcome to the Machine’ after you die facing the VortexQueen or ‘Sky Tides’ after you’re kicked out of ‘Tube of Medusa’ is as close tomental torture as it gets.) The password system is vastly insufficient:clearing a level at long last is a short-lived relief, since it only means thatyou’ll be stuck in the next one for an undetermined amount of time. As aresult, progression in Ecco is notsmooth and rewarding, but rather jagged and unfulfilling, an unpleasantalternation of teeth-grinding hours spent redoing the same things andbreakthroughs too brief to be enjoyable. Eccois way too unforgiving, demanding nothing but absolute perfection, and ends upbeing both infuriating and discouraging instead of compelling and rewarding. Despitenumerous attempts over the years, I never managed to truly and sincerely enjoyplaying Ecco, let alone finish any ofthe two games. I purchased the more forgiving Game Gear versions and clearedthem many times, but that’s not where my heart was: the waters where I wantedto swim were the 16-bit ones, gorgeous and enticing—yet cruelly unwelcoming. Watered-down legacyTwenty-twoyears after its glorious incipit, Ecco’slegacy remains a mixed one. Despite being widely hailed as an absolute gem ofthe 16-bit era and as one of the most innovative games ever created, it ishardly played nowadays, no doubt because of its unforgiving nature.Annunziata’s repeated fails at making his creation thrive only worsened things:the series could never be amended, and it slowly slipped away from awarenessand disappeared from the gaming landscape. Seen from our current era, Ecco ultimately appears as a brief flashof greatness, a game series that could have been outstanding but somehow missedits moment and slowly sunk into oblivion instead.  That’s notto say that Ecco was not madeavailable to newer generations through various ports. It was ported all right,but significantly less than you would expect a game of this caliber to be; ontop of that, it was never remade, which is a telling sign that developers andpublishers alike are still wary and uncomfortable around it. As for the ports,they exclusively consist of downloadable releases on four different platformsand inclusions in three compilations of Megadrive/Genesis games, which ishardly a glorious résumé. And yet it’s one of these compilations that finallyput an end to my long years of unrequited love for Ecco, in the sweetest and most unexpected way.  I purchasedthe Sega Megadrive Collection (alsoknown as the Sega Genesis Collection)for the PSP mostly for the Phantasy Stargames featured on it, which I never played and yearned to discover. Of course,my sharp eye also spotted the Eccogames; but by that time, I had virtually renounced the series and accepted thefact that these games and me were not meant together. But a short time ago, loand behold! I found myself yearning to play Eccoonce again, to make one more attempt at swimming my way through its dangerouswaters. My gaming instinct had spoken, and I followed it.The verysecond I started my run, I noticed things were different—for the better. Forone thing, I felt more at home playing Eccoon a handheld, by sheer virtue of being so used to portable systems. Foranother, the PSP’s supple and cleverly arranged buttons were actually much moresuited to playing Ecco than the stifferand ill-positioned ones found on the Megadrive/Genesis controller: the large,pliant D-pad allowed a better control of the dolphin’s trajectory and the tightlygrouped action buttons made the use of Ecco’s Charge Sonar (dash button+ sonar button) much easier than the aligned Megadrive/Genesis ones. For thefirst time ever, I felt that I was in full control of Ecco instead of struggling to control him, and it was a delightfulfeeling indeed. I could indulge in graceful and fine-tuned jumps and swimswiftly like never before, all thanks to the PSP’s soft and compliant buttons.But the greatest improvement by many nautical miles was the presence of aninstant save system. O, the absolute joy! Thanks to this precious, I could preserveevery increment of my hard-earned progression and managed to eat away the game,slowly but surely. Not only that, but this save system allowed me to relax andbe more confident as I explored Ecco’shazardous seas. Instead of trembling at the idea of dying and having to restartthe whole level, I could luxuriate in the comforting feeling that should I die,I could reload my last save from just a couple of seconds earlier. And guesswhat happened? For the first time in my gaming life, I beat Ecco. I beat Ecco without cheating or skipping levels, just with a lot ofpatience and frequent saves. But there is more: for the first time in my gaminglife, I truly and sincerely enjoyedplaying Ecco. I enjoyed it from thebottom of my heart, and to be honest, I still have trouble wrapping my headaround that fact of huge magnitude. I enjoyedEcco, for all the oceans’ sake!! Andhow could I not have? With an instant save system, Ecco becomes a completely different game: it is stripped out of itsunfairness and become an excellently challenging game, both compelling andrewarding. It becomes the game it shouldhave been when it was first released, nothing less. It’s a tadbittersweet to realize that Eccocould have been so much better, nearly perfect in fact, had it been equippedwith something as simple and trivial as an instant save system. This was mostcertainly technically feasible at the time of its release, since Final Fantasy Legend II, released in1990 on the Gameboy, possessed such a system; and one can only ponder whyAnnunziata and his team decided instead to go for a much more unfair andpunishing password system with no checkpoints in levels. I would be tempted to whisper“fake longevity” at that point, since my run led me to realize that Ecco is a much shorter game than Ithought; in my memories, it was this extended nightmare that never seemed toend, but once played with an instant save system, it turns out that it’s reallynot much longer than your average 90’s platformer. Intentional checkpoint starvation is all the more plausible as Annunziata himself hinted years later that Ecco's longevity was an important factor to him and that he decided to harden the game in order to extend and preserve said longevity—more on that later. Ironically,Ecco anticipated by two decades oneof our current gaming era’s most heated debate, namely the question of whetherawesome graphics are enough to make a game excellent and should be prioritizedover gameplay. Ecco’s contribution tothat debate is crystal-clear: the series shows in a somewhat painful way thatgreat graphics—and soundtrack—amount to nothing if the gameplay is not properlybalanced. Ecco was one of the mostgorgeous games of its time and remains beautiful even nowadays, but that visualexcellence was not enough to compensate for its very potent gameplay issues andmake it a truly enjoyable game. Eccowas ultimately weighed down and sunk by its unforgiving and unbalanced gameplay,and all its picturesque, coral-esque beauty could not change that fate.  A splash of trivia (spoilers!)Last butnot least, let’s have a bit of juicy trivia about Ecco, shall we? Due to its unusual nature, the series may be evenmore susceptible to quirky anecdotes than your average game, andhere are the ones that struck me the most. —The murky matter of Ecco’s sex: in Tides ofTime’s booklet and in-game prologue and epilogue, Ecco is explicitly referred to as amale dolphin. However, things are not so clear-cut in the first game: not onlyis there no mention at all of Ecco’s sex in the game itself, but the bookletgoes to great lengths to keep this point undetermined by carefully avoiding anypersonal pronouns and using the name ‘Ecco’ instead (“Ecco’s home”, “Ecco’spod” rather than “his/her pod”). It seems indeed that the determination ofEcco’s sex was left entirely to the player’s discretion in the first game,before Annunziata or someone at Sega decided to clear the ambiguity and to assigna sex to the dolphin in Tides of Time. —Ecco messingwith evolution: Initially, the storyline called for a part where Ecco wouldencounter his mammal ancestors walking on dry land and somehow convince them tostart living underwater instead, which would have provided the quirkiestexplanation to the apparent paradox of having mammals such as dolphins livingin the ocean. Despite being a neat idea, it was scraped during development, notdoubt due to time and budget constraints; yet a few remains of this concept canstill be found in the game. A couple of dolphins ponder the weirdness of havingto surface to breathe while they live underwater, and in the ‘Origin Beach’level, two hidden glyphs can be triggered by using Ecco’s sonar on the rocksabove water level at each end of the stage. They contain a couple of sentencesreferring directly to that scraped narrative arc and give a fascinating glimpseinto a part of the story lost forever in the tides of time—and also sadlyremind us that many excellent ideas are bound to be mercilessly eliminatedduring a game’s development.  —Ecco’s hardcore… or not: Annunziata famously commented on his creation’s infamousdifficulty by admitting that he was paranoid about kids renting the game andclearing it in one week-end and thus made it hard to avoid this. This is highlyironic, knowing that in the early 90’s, there was no gaming rental system inEurope where Ecco was conceived andfirst released. (Why, Ed, couldn’t you have made the North-American versionhardcore and treat us Europeans to a softer one? Oh, well.) Not only that, butAnnunziata himself—or someone at Sega, for that matter—seems to have realizedthat Ecco went way overboard in thedifficulty department and subsequently tried to soften the game: the Mega-CDversion for all regions, as well as the Japanese Megadrive version, includedthe possibility to respawn at the last barrier glyph encountered rather thanrestarting the whole level. The Japanese Megadrive version would also spareEcco’s life if swallowed by the Vortex Queen: instead of being sent back to ‘Welcometo the Machine’, the player would end up in ‘The Stomach’ and could face theQueen again after exiting that short, labyrinthine and somewhat messy Japaneseexclusive. —The superiorMega-CD/ Sega CD version: Indeed, it would have been awesome if the Sega Megadrive Collection could also have included the Mega-CD/Sega CD version of Ecco. On top of being more forgivingthanks to the inclusion of the aforementioned check point system, it alsofeatures exclusive extra levels and a completely different soundtrack. Theextra levels sport graphics that are very reminiscent of Tides of Time, and there’s little doubt that Novotrade had startedworking on Ecco’s sequel when theydesigned those Mega-CD exclusives. As for the soundtrack, it’s much moreatmospheric than the Megadrive/Genesis one, but also significantly less bizarre: instead of being slightlydissonant and unnerving, it’s decidedly melodic and soothing, giving the game atotally different vibe—a vibe that I would have loved to be treated to. Oh,well. —Lost inthe tides of time: Tides of Time’svague and somewhat unsettling epilogue was supposed to be a transition to thethird entry of the series, explaining how Ecco decided to use the Time Machineto venture into unknown shores instead of destroying it. This third game wasfamously cancelled and we’re left instead with this bittersweet unresolved end,as well as a mysterious ‘Secret Password’ that is revealed at the end of theepilogue and was supposed to give access to special features in the never-to-bethird installment.    —My favourites:To wrap this up, here’s a self-indulgent compilation of Ecco favourites. As far as levels are concerned, it’s really hardto pick up a most-loved one: Ecco’slevels are all samey while Tides ofTime’s level are all drop-dead gorgeous, and they ultimately all have theirspecific charm. Still, I may be a tad fonder of the ‘Ice Levels’ in Ecco, while the ‘Good Future Levels’ in Tides of Time really fascinate me; Ialso harbour a perverse liking for Ecco’s‘Welcome to the Machine’, which is a thrilling challenge providing that youmake good use of Ecco’s Charge Sonar to eradicate the Vortex Drones. Asfor the music, while I love absolutely all tracks without exception, I adorethe subdued, frozen aloofness of ‘Ice Zone’, the unsettling, high-pitchedweirdness of ‘Welcome to The Machine’ and the focused, often-missed limpidityof the ‘Opening Theme’ in Ecco, aswell as the sharp, contained restlessness of ‘Aqua Tubeway’, the ever-building-up,never-quite-resolved tension of ‘Trellia’s Bay’ and the deep, poignant longing of‘Fin to Feather’ in Tides of Times. It’s nowtime to end this post, and I’m happy to do it on a highly positive note. I’m completelyelated and overjoyed by this most unexpected turn of events: after many yearsof unrequited love, I can finally adore Eccofully and completely, by enjoying its actual gameplay as much as itsaesthetics. I’m currently deep into Tidesof Time, which I started immediately after clearing Ecco, and there’s no doubt that I will also finish it at long last,with a lot of patience and save states. (Edit: I did finish it. Twice, no less! And boy, was it pure pleasure.) Better late than never, indeed! Thanksfor reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Brave: Surprisingly good", "date": "23/09/2014", "text": "When wasthe last time you heard of a good licensed game? As far as I can remember, theonly three occurrences of such a miracle were Ducktales on the NES/Gameboy, Aladdinon the Megadrive/Genesis and Goldeneyeon the N64: three gems that managed to garner universal praise, three goldenislands rising proudly in the middle of an endless ocean of turds. Licensedgames are a maligned genre if there ever was one, a genre no one expects anykind of gaming greatness from. Every gamer plays them at some point, sometimes extensively, yet you usually won’thear anyone remember fondly their amazing hours spent doing so. For instance, Iwent as far as to purchase The Lion Kingon three different platforms, namely on Megadrive, Gameboy and Game Gear, andcleared all three iterations numerous times; and yet I would be hard-pressed toclaim that I truly loved these games and that they are embedded in my memoryuntil the end of times. That wastwenty years ago, and I’ve not touched a licensed game since—that is, until mysister handed me a copy of Brave forthe DS as an impromptu gift. I was nonplussed by such a choice of game, until Iremembered that this was coming from someone who somehow managed to shy awayfrom licensed games her whole life and thus didn’t have any kind of prejudiceagainst them. Then, my game collector instinct kicked it and I started rubbingmy hands, elated to have a new game to add to my precious collection. Then Ipopped the cartridge out of the box and stuck it into my DS, anxious andcurious at once, and then… Oh dear. Let’s putit bluntly: Brave is good. Not the“good for a licensed game” type of goodness: it’s good per se. It’s anintrinsically delightful game that I will now praise without the slightest hintof shame, because I absolutely enjoyed it from beginning to end. Brave is an oddity in the licensed games landscape,straying from both the worn-out platforming and mini-game galore approachesusually favoured by the genre. Instead, Canadian developer BehaviourInteractive took their cues from the TombRaider series by building up Brave’score gameplay around jumping, block-pushing and puzzles of various sorts,before spicing up the formula with a healthy dose of hack-and-slash goodness.The result is a surprisingly competent adventure game with a strong combatelement that manages to shine in both departments—as well as in a couple ofothers, as we’ll see right now.Visually, Brave is quite excellent and on par withthe DS’ best offerings. It looks very much like a Playstation-era Tomb Raider entry at first sight, withits realistic textures, subdued colors, blocky shapes and ever-so-slightfuzziness. However, it doesn’t take long to notice that Brave is just much better and manages to avoid the inconveniencesthat plagued the first Tomb Raiderentries. For one thing, Brave’svisualisation, for all its similarities with Tomb Raider’s, is actually faux 3D, designed to give more depth tothe game world without compromising the gameplay; as a result, the cameraangles are predetermined and are always wisely selected in order to accommodatethe player’s moves and give them the best possible visibility, making progressionfluid and smooth. For another, Bravemostly takes place in the wild outdoors, offering the player gorgeous vistasand sparing them the claustrophobia-inducing endless caves so prominent in the Tomb Raider series. Merida’s animationsare incredible and it’s clear that a lot of work went into designing them:swift, graceful and light-footed in exploration mode, the red-headed becomes aruthless fighter as soon as combat kicks in, dealing powerful and precise blowswhile assuming impeccable fighting stances. The enemies’ animations are slowerand more rigid yet fit them perfectly, revealing their status of zombie-likeentities controlled by an external force.  Brave also shines on the aural department, treatingthe player to a variety of Celtic-inspired themes that occasionally take afilmic quality. The fighting theme is deliciously frantic, while the boss themeis conveniently ominous; other themes range from light-hearted and bubbly toatmospheric and moody, with a slow yet noticeable progression from the formerto the latter as the game unfolds. Sure, this soundtrack doesn’t pack anyhighly memorable track à la ‘The Moon’ in Ducktales,but it’s still an excellent offering that beautifully completes the graphicsand polishes the atmosphere. Looks areall well and good, but how does Bravefare gameplay-wise? Well, that was probably the biggest surprise here: Brave plays the part perfectly—heck, it plays perfectly, full stop. Brave treats the player to somestunningly well-honed and efficient physics that could give lessons to manygames—including the aforementioned TombRaider series, often mocked for its clunky physics and for Lara Croft’s30-ton-truck grace. Brave’s jumpingphysics are particularly brilliant: not only can you jump high and far, but youcan also change direction and add some momentum to your jump while in mid-air.This transforms the jumping business from the dreaded chore it usually is inthese kind of 3D or faux 3D games into a highly pleasurable process that youcan enjoy to the fullest, confident that you’ll land precisely wherever youwant. Brave is also pleasantly fast,Merida running at a good speed by default. As for the fighting physics, theyare as perfect as the rest. You can switch between the bow and the sword,knowing that the game harbours a slight positive bias towards the former. (Thismay be due to narrative reasons, since Merida is supposed to be the Kingdom’sbest archer in the movie.) The bow benefits from automatic aim providing thatyou’re facing enemies, while the sword requires positioning yourself accuratelybefore delivering a blow; in both cases, the physics are top-notch and incrediblysatisfying. You can even slash your sword or fire an arrow while jumping, whichmay not be so useful but is nonetheless enjoyable and very well executed.Another more useful trick is the possibility to shoot arrows while runningaround, which can give you the opportunity to escape potential blows whilecontinuing to deal damage. And talking about escaping blows, there is no parrymechanics in Brave: instead, youperform a swift escape move that will temporarily shield you from enemies’attacks and can sometimes be a life-saver, especially during boss fights. There is anever-so-slight RPG element at work in Brave,which takes the form of upgrading your equipment and learning new abilities.Equipment upgrades are scattered through the game world and can be found inchests, while new abilities can be acquired between levels. Instead of relyingon good ol’ level-grinding, Bravelets you first collect golden orbs in the levels, either by opening chests orby slaughtering enemies (this is interestingly referred to as “purifying”them), then offers you to exchange the collected orbs for various abilities.You can purchase upgrades and new attacks for your sword and bow, as well asabilities that will improve your health and recovery. While this purchasingsystem with orbs acting as currency may seem like an odd design choice, itintroduces a pleasant modicum of customization in a game that remains verylinear at its core, allowing you to either focus solely on your favouriteabilities or to ravenously buy them all, by replaying former levels to collectmore orbs if need be. Not only that, but it also gives the possibility to tweakthe difficulty level. Brave is afairly easy game by default, but can be made significantly harder if, say, youchoose to stick to the basic equipment provided at the beginning of the gameand to avoid purchasing some specific upgrades like the Health upgrades or theone that allows you to fire several arrows at once. Despite allthat goodness, Brave has a flaw thatis very difficult to ignore: it’s criminally short, clocking at only a coupleof hours. I nearly cleared it in one go the first time I played it, andactually forced myself to stop and resume my run the next day, not wanting toface the crushing disappointment of finishing a game the very day I started it.However, this shortness is compensated by a huge replay value. Brave is a game that can be replayedover and over and remain enticing by virtue of its top-notch physics, beautifulgraphics and gorgeous music. It’s a sweet treat that is perfect for a quick,fast-paced gaming fix—and let’s face it, games like that are necessary in thegaming landscape and provide a much-needed balance with 70-hours long titles. Iactually replayed Brave a good numberof times after my first run and found myself enjoying it more and more, and itpleases me greatly to know that I can come back to it anytime when I crave a shortyet fulfilling gaming session. All in all,Brave is a game that certainlydoesn’t revolutionize the gaming world, but rather reuses a batch oftried-and-tested ideas and seems content to snuggle into a fairly classic formula. However, it does so with style and gusto and manages to offer a highlycohesive and enjoyable gaming experience, short but sweet. I would absolutelyrecommend this game to any adventure game and/or Hack-and-Slash aficionado,especially since it’s possible to find very cheap copies nowadays. And now, I’mgoing to indulge myself with yet another run of Brave, and maybe another one after that. Thanks for reading, and bemy guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Ys I&II Chronicles/Legacy of Ys: Bumping right into greatness ", "date": "16/09/2014", "text": "Two decadesago, I made my first foray into the Holy Realm of RPG, a land of true beautythat I never left since; and that first foray was made through an Action-RPG,namely the cult classic Legend of Zelda:Link’s Awakening. This was an exhilarating experience, soon to be followedby the completion of other famous Action-RPGs—Landstalker, Seiken Densetsu3, Terranigma, you name them.Action-RPG became my first love and beacon in the RPG landscape, and eventhough I’m expanded my vistas since then, I will always have a certain fondnessfor that subgenre, as well as a feeling of immediate familiarity whenconfronted with one of its members. (Indeed, it usually only takes me a coupleof minutes to get a good grip on the physics and start slaughtering my way through with zeal and ease.) What better thing to do, then, than to go back to the very roots of thegenre and discover the first installments of one of the most illustrious andvenerable Action-RPG series ever created, the cult Ys series? Well, probably to do it twice, by playing both the DS and PSP versions of the said firstinstallments. First,let’s weave a few words about the series. Loosely based on the French legend ofthe City of Ys on the coast of Brittany, the Ys series is the creation of Japanese developer Nihon Falcom, whichremained in control of it ever since. It spanned multiple gaming eras andconsole generations, from the late 80’s to nowadays, with the recent release of Ys: Memories of Celceta on the Vita. Justlike the Legend of Zelda series, Ys is a highly unified series of gamestaking place in the same world and featuring a cast of recurring charactersfrom game to game—starting with its hero, red-headed Adol Christin. Thesettings and atmosphere are also quite consistent: the world of Ys is full to the brim with serene,quiet temples, dignified goddess statues and vistas so wide them make you feel tiny, allthings giving the series a solemn, nearly mythological quality. Now, let’selaborate on the games, and let’s try not to get lost in the process. Legacy of Ys: Book I&II (released onthe DS in 2008­[jp] and 2009[na]) and YsI&II Chronicles (released on the PSP in 2009[jp] and 2011[na/eu]) are bothremakes of Ys I&II, released in1989(jp) for the PC Engine and 1990(na) for the TurboGrafx-CD, which is itselfan enhanced remake of the first two Ysinstallments, released in 1987 and 1988 in Japan for the PC-8801. These firsttwo entries have been lumped together ever since, and have been remade andported countless times to a zillion different platforms. I won’t detail allthese releases for the sake of everybody’s sanity, but suffice it to say thatthe DS and PSP remakes are the latest entries in a very, very long line ofports and remakes indeed, and certainly won’t be the last of it. Who’s bad?Having thesame game released on two rival platforms sweetly harks back to the 16-bitdays, when the SNES and Megadrive/Genesis versions of famous games werecarefully compared in order to determine which was the baddest of the two—inthe Michael Jackson acception of the word. I can’t resist indulging in such acomparison here, even though my stance on the matter is that both versionsshould be tried, tested and ultimately owned, for they each have theirstrengths, weaknesses and particular charm. Let’s start with the DS version, which isthe first one I played and also the source of all the pictures in this post.The greatest strength of Legacy of Ys:Books I&II lies in its attempt to tweak the fighting system ever soslightly, making it more complex and varied: you are given the choice betweenswinging your sword around by using buttons or bumping directly into enemies byusing the stylus—the latter being the original Ys fighting mechanics and the former appearing as a concession to amore classic approach of real-time fighting. And yet, interestingly, the button-basedsword-swinging mechanic is the most complex and challenging of the two,involving a perfect timing and rhythm that, when they are mastered, can becomeincredibly intoxicating. (I swear that at some point, while I was engaged ina bout of level-grinding, I had to forcemyself to stop butchering everything in sight and to go back to the main quest.)It’s also a more user-friendly game: the interface is very intuitive and thetouchscreen is cleverly used to display a welcome map that is totally absentfrom the PSP version and can be a life-saver at times. Last but not least, the DS iteration of Ys I packs an extradungeon absent from the PSP version. On the negative side, Legacy of Ys is tainted by horrendous graphics that don’t dojustice to the DS capabilities. They are a clumsy mix of 2D and 3D elements,further maimed by some constant fuzziness and the use of ugly washed-outcolours: the final tableau is jarring and seriously unpleasant to look at,except for a few selected spots that show some unexpected beauty. The PSP version fares much better as far asgraphics are concerned. Instead of trying to give them a complete overhaul andfailing at it like Legacy, Ys I&II Chronicles chose rather tostick to 2D graphics and to give them the most gorgeous makeover: colours areincredibly vibrant, details are breathtakingly rendered and everything isdeliciously glossy and slick, making Chroniclesultimately look like a 16-bit era RPG with a gorgeous modern glaze. The game isjust a tad too dark in some areas, and unfortunately reprises that infuriatingtrick of reducing the visibility in some dungeons by making everythingpitch-black except for a tiny circle around the hero. (This was present in theoriginal game, and could very well have been left there, thank you very much.)But apart from that, Ys I&IIChronicles is the graphically superior game. It also features better andfiner animations that are a feast for the eye: seeing enemies explode in adozen pieces when they are killed, their limbs flying around, is a guiltypleasure if I ever saw one, as well as seeing Adol comically drop his equipmentand fall flat on his face when he’s defeated. Flames feel hot and burning,beams of light are bright and dazzling, and everything feels exquisitely alive. On top of all that goodness, Chronicles allows you to choose betweenthree different soundtrack arrangements and to change them on the fly, as wellas between two different graphic styles for the cutscenes and cardboardcut-outs of the characters. On the minus side, the interface is definitely lessintuitive than the DS one, and the total absence of a map can be stinging attimes.  Legacy of Ys: Books I&II-Nintendo DSYs I&II Chronicles-PSPThe gorgeous land of YsAs primitive as Legacy/Chronicles mayappear by today’s standards, they are nonetheless enhanced remakes that vastlyimprove on the original Ys formula.The most obvious improvements are obviously in the aural and graphical departments,but there are more enhancements to be found. To cater to modern gaming sensibilities, thedifficulty level can now be selected at the beginning of a run, allowing theplayer to get exactly the kind of ride they wish for, from the airiest to the most masochistic. The most significant enhancement, however, is undoubtedly the meticulous crafting of the atmosphere. Given that all the numerous remakes of Ys I and Ys II were always handled by Nihon Falcom, wecan be confident that the vision of Ysthey brought forth over the years is the one they had in mind from the verystart of the series, but couldn’t fully bring to life because of the technicallimitations of the late 80’s. And that vision is one of amazing beauty, indeed.Details abound in Legacy/Chronicles, making the world of Ys vibrant and alive to an extent I’ve hardly seen before, even in modern games. Nihon Falcom’s approach is almostnaturalistic, with its unwavering focus on seemingly trivial details: people’skitchens are full of groceries being cooked, their beds are covered withbeautiful coloured bedspreads, theirs shelves crammed with books, their walls clutteredwith memorabilia and so on. Old mines are full of discarded carts, shovels andpiles of rocks, forsaken temples look conveniently decayed with cracks in theirwalls and missing floor tiles, and bosses’ lairs are occasionally stuffed withdecade-old skeletons and dried pools of blood displaying the ferocity of theirhost. Just as this is the case with the numerousremakes of Final Fantasy I, playing Legacy/Chronicles is like staring at a past long gone through a magnifyingglass. Despite all the very visible embellishments, the game remains the sameat its core, a relic following the rules of its era. In typical 8-bit fashionand just like in FFI, dungeons areconveniently labyrinthine to compensate for the absence of any meaty dungeonpuzzle; however, they are made much more palatable than the FFI dungeons by the Action-RPG nature ofLegacy/Chronicles. Instead of being interrupted every couple of seconds bya random fight, one can ram into enemies at full speed and progress without ahitch, which transforms the exploration of dungeons into a fast-paced, hectic roam—enhancedall the more by the shrill, roaring soundtrack (more on that later). This isthe polar opposite of the trudging through dungeons favoured in Turn-BasedRPGs, and one can only imagine the breath of fresh air that the Ys series provided when it was releasedand how much novelty and variety it insufflated into the rather monotonous RPGlandscape of that time.  Not that Ys I and Ys II were the first Action-RPGs ever released, mind you: before themcame Hydlide and Dragon Slayer in 1984,the latter being also a Nihon Falcom creation and the former actually inspiringYs’ own fighting system. However,Ys did things bigger, and better: ittook Hydlide’s incomplete and broken“bumping” mechanic and turned it into a full-blown arcade-lite process, aguilty pleasure that remains intact through the whole game—and the years. Evenwhen Adol’s maximum level is attained, it remains a pleasure to blow enemiesinto bloody pieces by the sole power of your mighty body colliding with theirs. Adol's breathtaking speed puts the final touch to these excellent physics and transforms the fighting business into a dangerously intoxicating affair: Legacy/Chronicles is hands down in my top three of the Action-RPGs withthe most ridiculously addictive and enjoyable physics and fighting systemever, along with Terranigma and Children of Mana. The narrative is also significantly morefleshed-out than your typical 8-bit storyline. I’ve already said that I don’tcare that much about storyline elements in RPGs: for me, a great story isalways a plus, but never the main reason why I will pick up a game. (I’musually quite content with just being ordered to beat the resident Big Baddieto a pulp without any kind of justification, and I’d rather have a crappy storythat doesn’t get in the way of the gameplay than being interrupted everyfive minutes by some bits of storytelling, no matter how excellent andconvincing they may be.) I didn’t expect much from Legacy/Chronicles in thenarrative department, especially after my experience with FFI; it thus came as a pleasant surprise that Ys’ first two entries packed such an excellent story. For onething, the story carries on from the first game to the second, which was farfrom being the norm at that time. It also introduces a full-blown mythology,yet to be fully developed in future Ysinstallments but already very much consistent and articulated. The story istold with a lot of flair and sobriety, blending the profane and the sacred in agraceful and wonderfully natural way; and even though some twists and outcomescan be anticipated without too much effort, it remains a beguiling adventurethat ends on a beautiful and peaceful note. The characters are also incrediblywell fleshed-out and endearing, many of them lending a hand to Adol over thecourse of his adventure without being too unrealistically devoted to him. Andtalking about Adol, he undoubtedly has the aura and charisma of a mythologicalhero. He may be a silent protagonist à la Link, but his presence isunmistakable, and making him the recurrent Hero of the Ys series was really an astute move on Nihon Falcom’s part. Thenotion of a recurrent main character is always an enticing one, all the more sowhen the said character is as magnetic as Adol Christin. (Isn’t his very namealready suitably intriguing?)    Of course, it’s nearly impossible to talkabout Legacy/Chronicles and the Ysseries in general without mentioning its music and giving a well-deservedaccolade to composers Yuzo Koshiro and Mieko Ishikawa. The former, better knownfor his eardrum-blowing work on Streetsof Rage, was still relatively unknown at the time, as well as MiekoIshikawa, who’s incidentally been working at Nihon Falcom ever since, and theyplayed a huge part in shaping up the singular ambiance of the series’ first twoinstallments. Miles away from the pastoral soundtracks favoured in most RPGssince the dawn of the genre, Ys I&II’ssoundtrack is a beautiful, intricate and highly distinctive affair borrowingfrom prog-rock as well as new-wave and weaving its various influences in amasterful way. It was much more complex than most game soundtracks of the 8-bitera and has been since rearranged several times for remakes. Legacy recycles the lacklustre synth-onlymix already used in Ys I&II Complete,a Japan-only PC remake released in 2001, while Chronicles, in a shrewd move, adds to it the original PC-8801 mixand a PSP exclusive mix. The exclusive PSP mix is far sweeter to my ears thanthe Complete synths soup, and thePC-8801 is an historical curiosity that’s worth (re)discovering, which makes Chronicles the aurally superior game byfar. Both YsI and Ys II are incredibly shortaffairs, clocking respectively at roughly 5-6 and 10-12 hours of gameplay—figuresthat can probably be divided by two once one knows their games well. Thatdoesn’t prevent them from flirting dangerously with fake longevity byintroducing a good dose of forced backtracking and aloof crypticness. Ofcourse, it’s hard to blame them too harshly for that: crypticness andbacktracking were RPG staples in the 8-bit era, after all, and we knew from thestart that Legacy and Chronicles, for all their modernfrosting, were rather ancient. Being magnanimous towards these quirks is onething, putting up with them when one is playing the games is another: I admitwithout a hint of shame that I resorted more than once to FAQs to get out of abind, not wanting to meander for hours to finally uncover a sequence of eventsthat was not strictly and coldly logicalto start with. Fortunately, these minor flaws get milder on subsequent runs:the crypticness virtually evaporates, and the forced backtracking becomes muchmore tolerable once one knows where they are headed. The evolutionYs I and Ys II were released amere year apart and re-released together just a year after the release of Ys II. Since then, they’ve been steadilypresented together as a bundle of sorts, which can lead one to ponder what kindof rapport exists between the two. Were they conceived as a single game butreleased as two installments due of an uncanny mix of time constraints,technical limitations and desire to cash in, à la Sonic 3&Knuckles? Are they considered too short to be presentedalone? Is it an issue of storyline consistency, the two games sharing a common,overarching storyline? Well, the answer is unclear, and may very well be atangled mix of all the aforementioned reasons. Instead of dwelling on the why and ponder the reasons for this(re)union, let’s investigate the howand examine the relation between Ys Iand Ys II. The first thing to do when examining twoinstallments of a series following each other, especially two first installments, is to look for an evolutionbetween the two. Let’s first take a peek at YsI. Fully titled Ys: Ancient YsVanished, it gloriously establishes the basis of the series and introducesall its most famous staples: the intoxicating bumping mechanic, the thrillingsoundtrack, the mythical-lite atmosphere, the charming characters, thelabyrinthine dungeons, the forced backtracking and the aloof crypticness. It’s a brief butcohesive affair that offers a lot of fun and doesn’t pretend to be more thanwhat it is, i.e. a short and straightforward Action-RPG. Ys II, fully titled Ys II: AncientYs Vanished-The Final Chapter, is a tad less straightforward—and a good bitlonger too, for that matter. It’s a gamethat doesn’t follow any of the usual evolution processes between two firstinstallments of a series: it doesn’t turn the series on its head à la Zelda, nor does it introduce tons of newfeatures à la Seiken Densetsu. If the title itself is anindication, Ys II should be more akinto an extended reprise of Ys I.  And surprise, surprise, this is exactly whatit is: Ys II totally feels like anenhanced remake of Ys I, expanding oneverything present in the first game. The only authentic new feature isthe use of magic, which is remarkably well handled and a very welcome additionto the series’ excellent fighting mechanics—so kudos to Nihon Falcom for that. Nomore kudos should be handed, though: apart from that lone innovation, the onlynovelty factor is that there is moreof everything: dungeons are bigger and more labyrinthine, there are more itemsto collect and more levels to gain, and—o dismay— there is more forced backtrackingand more aloof crypticness. Unfortunately, this is not enough to make the game moreinteresting: a bigger labyrinthinedungeon is not mechanically more enjoyable that a smaller one—if anything, it’srather the opposite. Worse, Ys I’sinnocent flirt with fake longevity comes dangerously close to becoming afull-blown romance in Ys II: not only is theforced backtracking more present, but it covers longer distances by virtue ofthe dungeons’ swollen layouts, which can be downright annoying. The lastdungeon encompasses all the game’s flaws: it is ridiculously gigantic comparedto the rest of the adventure and combines labyrinthine pathways, nearlyconstant backtracking and invariable decors preventing the player to rely ontheir visual memory and forcing them to methodically map out and remember theirprogression. (This beast of a dungeon was fortunately more palatable the secondtime around when I played Chronicleson the PSP, but my first encounter with it in Legacy was a trifle nightmarish.)  That being said, I’m not claiming that Ys II is a bad game, for it is not: it’sactually a highly enjoyable offering, despite the flaws I mentioned. But forsome unfathomable reason, it’s not your typical sophomore entry: it doesn’trenew the Ys I formula and it doesn’tbetter it either. It just pads it somehow, and by some strange twist of fate,this padding ends up feeling more like a dilution. Ys I was pleasantly compact and earthy, like a porridge, while Ys II is somewhat thinner and moreelaborate, like a velouté. Both are excellent and enjoyable in their own way,depending on what kind of experience you’re in the mood for; but ironically,because of these different flavours, clearing both games at once may not be thebest idea ever despite their narrative continuity. By playing Legacy/Chronicles, I mostlywanted to discover the early stages of one of my favourite subgenres in theHoly Realm of RPG; but to my utter delight, I extracted more than I expectedfrom that digging into a somewhat magnified past. Not only did I discover afull-blown series of Action-RPG, which is a pleasure that has become so rare inthis era that it must be enjoyed to the fullest, but I also discovered adeveloper that piqued my interest, the venerable Nihon Falcom. Unbeknownst tobe until now, I actually own a couple of other Nihon Falcom games—namely Gurumin: a Monstrous Adventure, Trails in the Sky and The Legend of Heroes: a Tear of Vermillion,all games that I will now consider with renewed interest.  And of course, there are the four other Ys entries, which I will play with gustoand hopefully enjoy as much as Legacyand Chronicles. Thanks for reading,and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Riviera-The Promised Land: A finely chiseled gem", "date": "09/09/2014", "text": "Before, when I heard the word ‘Riviera’, Iwould exclusively think of the sun-kissed beauty of the famed French southerncoastline. That word would conjure up images of azure skies and seas in allshades of blue, laced with touches of palm trees, rainbow-coloured gelati,Cannes Film Festival glamour and St-Tropez old-fashioned charm. But that wasbefore. Now, when I hear ‘Riviera’, I will also think of a game like no other:a beautiful and polished gem, sparkling with ingenuity, finesse and flair.  Everything in Riviera: The Promised Land flutters with originality andinventiveness, starting with its very origins. The game had a most unusualbirth: developed by Sting, it was originally released on the little-knownWonderSwan Color as the first entry of the Dept. Heaven series, a string ofgames explicitly designed with originality in mind. (Three extra games cameafter Riviera, namely Yggdra Union, Knights in the Nightmareand Gungnir—which I all own but yethave to play, incidentally.) Rivierawas then ported to the Gameboy Advance in 2004(jp) and 2005(na) and ultimatelyto the PSP in 2006(jp) and 2007(na/eu), with a few minor alterations includingvoice acting, remixed music and redrawn cutscenes. (Incidentally, this is the version I own and will dissect in this very post.) The game was mostly leftunaltered though, which was basically the best thing to do: better let this gemshine in all its original, crystalline glory. Gorgeous abstractionIf Riviera’sintroductory sequence looks like virtually any other introductory sequencepulled from a J-RPG, one only has to play the game in earnest a few seconds torealise that they stepped into a game like no other. I won’t painstakinglydetail the progression system here, for such in-depth descriptions can be foundsomewhere else on the internet: suffice it to say that Riviera gently frames the player’s progression while giving them a freerein in virtually every other department. The framing is done by having thegame take place on a series of fixed screens, with only a couple of possiblemoves available; and yet, inside that canalised progression lies a vast freedomof choice regarding the fighting, the investigation of certain selected spotsor the romancing of your partners. In practice, Riviera looks and plays like an uncanny mix of comic strip and‘Choose-your-own-adventure’ gamebook, in which the characters crosssimilar-looking fixed screens and seem to jump from one to the next just likethey would jump between a comic book’s panels, all the while making decisionsthat will have an influence on ulterior events and ultimately alter the story’send.  Riviera’s rigid and somewhat abstract structure is echoed by its overallvisual abstraction. This design orientation shines through the clear-cut and geometriclines and shapes of the scenery elements, which are always seen from the same immovablecamera angle. It also shines through the colours: they are kept to a minimum,each screen having a dominant hue, and they mimic the texture of oil paint, acrylicpaint or watercolour depending on the screen, aiming at complete stylizationrather than realism. Last but not least, this visual abstraction shines brighterthan ever in the map displays shown between sections, which are nothing morethan a couple of interconnected white rectangles displayed on a blackbackground along with a name and picture of the next area in line. This type ofaesthetics is deeply striking and highly unusual in RPGs, which usually preferto follow a more pastoral route in that department; yet against all odds, it worksremarkably well, giving Riviera a stronglycoherent and truly unique visual identity. This original visual brand isbeautifully complimented by the intoxicating and slightly obsessive soundtrack,all roaring electric guitars, layered synths, delicate strings and soft chimes laidout in uncluttered, crystalline arrangements and played in vigorous, compulsiveloops. The art direction regarding the charactersfollows this abstract trend, to very fine results. Despite the amount of skinexposed by the many mythological creatures present in the game, both male andfemale, Riviera manages to gracefullyshy away from any tackiness or vulgarity. The main characters have fortunatelybeen spared any kind of degradation for the sake of fan-service, which seems tobe a constant as far as the Dept. Heaven series is concerned. (Take a look at Knights in the Nightmare’s DS cover:I’ve never seen a character thatcovered in a J-RPG.) All characters models, both heroes and foes, have adistinctive sharp and no-frills look, with trim lines and a low level ofdetails. They look cute and a tad childish, in typical J-RPG fashion, yetmanage to convey some maturity and calm, which is a pleasant change from yourrun-of-the-mill extravagant J-RPG characters. For all its sheer originality andmesmerizing quality, this visual abstraction could create a certain dryness andmake the game world look and feel cold, impersonal and somewhat insubstantial,with potential player alienation looming on the horizon. Sting seems to haveanticipated that side effect and taken the necessary measures to counteract it.As a result, the game world is fleshed out in very subtle yet effective ways. Beautifulsepia maps are shown between each chapter alongside a bit of narrative, providingan elegant counterpoint to the highly abstract ones displayed between chapters’subsections. Full-size portraits of eachcharacter are shown before they launch a special attack, complete with theattack’s name and ‘motto’—a catchy sentence that lets you imagine the best.Foes are given the same treatment—albeit without the motto feature—letting youfear the worse and hope that your party will not be wiped out. Even thatbeautiful and epic picture of our heroes facing a horde of monsters thatappears as a background during battle preparations plays its part in fleshingout the atmosphere and making the game world more alive and vibrant. (Incidentally,this picture used to be the Gameboy Advance version box art, recycled here in anice nudge to Riviera’s past.) Pristine battlingRiviera’s content and gameplay is as precise and elegant as itspresentation, which is a sheer delight. The result is a masterpiece ofcrystalline progression in which every unnecessary obstruction and filler havebeen removed for the sake of gameplay’s fluidity. Take the battling matter, forinstance: Riviera ditches thesomewhat messy random battle approach in favour of a neat series of unavoidablefights that take place in predefined areas. Every one of these fights thusbecomes an event of huge magnitude that must be approached with the rightamount of preparation and handled with the right strategy. This is the polaropposite of the ‘millions-of-random-battles’ model favoured by most RPGs, andit comes across as strikingly efficient and polished. Thetotal absence of random battles is not synonymous with an absence oflevel-grinding, though. There is a modicum of level-grinding in Riviera, and it is given the same preciseand clear-cut treatment as the field battles. The grinding process is entirely separatedfrom the main progression and takes place in a special arena that can beaccessed at any given time. This is an clever design that casts thelevel-grinding as an activity in its own right, taking place in parallel withthe main storyline and offering a pleasant diversion from it, rather than as achore regularly interrupting the player’s progression. Riviera’s peculiar brand of grinding is also a highly productiveone that reaps pleasant rewards: instead of levelling up slowly by piling upXP, the characters level up once they’ve dealt a certain number of blows with aspecific weapon—typically between three and nine; the progression is thusincredibly fast and can be tightly monitored. Once a weapon is fully mastered,the character’s stats raise and a special attack is learned. Called “OverskillAttacks”, these devastating moves are the light and soul of all fights, andtrying to master them all is definitely one of Riviera’s greatest thrills as far as the fighting is concerned.  And since I’m mentioning the fighting,let’s be clear about one thing: Riviera’sfighting system is an absolute, dazzling gem of a fighting system. While it mayseem deceptively simple at first sight, it grows only deeper and deeper as oneprogresses through the game, revealing unexpected layers of complexity andbecoming all the more enjoyable. In typical Rivierafashion, it is slick and precise, allowing the player to fine-tune theirstrategies and providing them with all the necessary information to do so, bothduring preparations and during fights per se. Strategies must be streamlined,for only three party members can take part in battles, carrying a maximum offour items with them. If you add the fact that items only have a limited numberof uses, after which they are gone for good, and that the general inventoryitself can only hold fifteen items, the necessity to strategize all fightsbecomes obvious. That’s not to say that the game places a dagger under yourthroat, forcing you to be fully prepared or die; Riviera is actually a fairly easy game that lets you restart afight as many times as you want in case you lose—with your foes slightlyweakened for good measure—thus removing any kind of stress and making way forpure, unaltered pleasure. As a whole, Riviera’sfights are crisp and elegant affairs, highlighted by the regular bursts ofOverskill Attacks, all grand presentation, thrilling animations and hits enmasse. (To be honest, I felt ridiculously elated every time I pressed the Xbutton to launch such a deliciously devastating attack.)  Expandingthe freedomAs excellent as it is, the fighting systemis not the only feature that breathes freedom through Riviera’s corseted structure. A more subtle level of freedom is atwork in the game, unbeknownst to the player at first, but more and moreperceptible as one make their way through Riviera—the land as well as the game. This is where the so-called ‘Trigger Points’come into the picture. They are points that you earn through fights, theefficiency of your fighting technique determining the number of points you willreap. These points can then be used to investigate selected spots in everyfixed screen and uncover a range of secrets. While combing these spots is by nomeans necessary to progress through the main storyline, they can expand youradventure nonetheless and are the first door into this finer level of freedom Imentioned above. The items that you may discover through the use of theseTrigger Points, as well as the small events that you may trigger, will alter thegameplay and the storyline in sometimes significant ways. This is an ingeniousand well-honed system that is fully rewarding rather than punishing, as one mayexpect at first sight. When I read about these Trigger Points in the game’s booklet,I feared that they would be mandatory to progress and that should one run outof points, they could end up being stuck in limbo forever. Of course, thisnever happened—nor did I actually ever ran out of points, for that matter—sinceTrigger Points are here not to restrain your freedom, but rather to astutelyexpand it beyond the boundaries imposed by Riviera’sinflexible structure. The dating-sim side of Riviera is another doorway into that muted freedom lingering beyondthe game’s austere presentation. The first interesting thing about Riviera’s dating business is that thepossibility of a romantic involvement between Ein and one of his teammates isabsolutely never mentioned during the game, and barely alluded to in thebooklet. It’s like Sting wanted the dating side to come out as a surprise, anunexpected reward at the end of the game. The player could be forgiven formissing clues here, for Riviera’swooing process is as subtle and subdued as it can be: ditching the usual‘shower your love interest with gifts’ trope, Riviera favours instead an approach in which seemingly unimportantevents that are in no way related to courtship play an crucial part in earningyour partners’ affections. The most obvious romancing tool is probably the multiplechoice dialogues with the ladies, with their typical answers ranging from flatteringto derogatory; however, it’s but the tip of the courtship iceberg. Battles playa part as well: the lady that deals the last blow and wraps up the fight willexperience a boost of her affection for Ein. Then comes the chest business:most of the time, the process of opening a chest (with the use of TriggerPoints) will stir the interest of one of the ladies, who will comment on theprocess. A QTE will then pop out of the blue; mastering it not only allows youto get your hands on the chest’s content, but also raises the level ofaffection of that specific lady that was so interested in the chest in thefirst place. Other seemingly unromantic choices and events play their part inraising the ladies’ affections, but I won’t detail them all here, for there areFAQ doing just that, and much better than I could ever do. Suffice it to saythat this unsuspected romancing, on top of letting the player exert theirfreedom of choice in an utterly enjoyable and welcome way, also gives Riviera a huge replay value. There aresix endings available, each one of them entailing vastly different runs withspecific choices and strategies; as a result, the game must be restartedvirtually from scratch if one wants to select a different course of action.Tying the courtship and thus the nature of the ending to battling, openingchests and other unrelated events, de facto making it organically linked to therest of the game, was an absolute stroke of genius, and kudos must be handed toSting for creating a game in which the wooing is more than a side dish than caneasily be taken care of by showering the love interests with sweet talk andpresents.  In that regard, a small account of my runis well called-for. I missed a lot of secrets, which is not so surprising for afirst playthrough; to make matters worse, my lack of motors skills led me tofail pitifully countless times when presented with QTE, and I lost a goodamount of potentially interesting items in the process, as well as goodopportunities to make the ladies smitten with my skilful self. And talkingabout this, I initially thought I had done a fairly good job in raising theladies’ affection for me, but it finally turned out that they didn’t trust methat much, let alone loved me. Unbeknownstto me at that time, Cierra was the most well-inclined towards me—and thefeeling was mutual: she was by far my strongest party member, dealingdevastating blows with her unstoppable magic rods and more often than not puttingan exhilarating end to fights with a blazing flurry of attacks. I had pamperedher and moulded her into the ultimate foe-killer, training her patiently andstocking up piles of magic rods for her… Only to have her killed just beforethe Final Boss Fight. O, the absolute dismay! I was crestfallen, and I had tocontent myself with less powerful Lina and Fia for that most important fight.Lina was taken down after only a couple of turns, which made me fear that myparty was not going to survive this fight, let alone win it; but against allodds, I managed to slowly but surely wear down Seth-Rah, before finally obliteratingit with an intensely satisfying Lv.2 Overskill Attack—ironically delivered witha Southern Cross rod, of all weapons! I was elated, and even more so whenCierra was revived. Of course, I would have loved to fight with her during thatfinal fight, but alas, that was not meant to be. And maybe it was all for thebest after all, since this allowed me to witness the elusive and canonical“True Rose Ending”! This was a magnificent stroke of luck, for I’m sure Icouldn’t have fulfilled the requirements for this ending if that’s what I hadbeen trying to do. As for its content, I must say that I was deeply satisfiedwith the prospect of being Rose’s lifelong partner: I’ve had a fondness for cuteyet sharp-tongued Rose ever since she was introduced in the prologue, to thepoint where I was actually disappointed to be separated from her when the mainadventure started and really elated to be reunited with her in the Nelde Ruins.And now that this evasive and somewhat arcane ending is out of the way, I canreplay Riviera with a relaxed mindand try to win the ladies’ affection a tad more actively. (Gee, I’d betterstart training for these QTE right away, shouldn’t I?) Let’s wrap this up now, shall we? When allis said and done, Riviera comesacross as an amazing potpourri of game features and mechanics that gel togetherremarkably well. The game’s greatest tourde force is that it manages tolook and feel highly polished andcohesive despite being really nothing more than a collection of fixed screensand basic animations. Sting obviously knewwhat they were doing, and as a result, Rivierais slick, controlled and impeccable from the first frame to the last, everypixel shining with lustre and mastery. Despite its corseted structure, itmanages to offer an enormous amount of freedom in various departments and packsa huge replay value—more than some more open games, ironically. At its verycore, Riviera is a fascinating crystallizationof the very essence of RPG: all flourishes and ornaments like random battles,endless inventory space, dozens of NPCs, huge open world and so on have beenruthlessly and shamelessly removed to focus solely on the core of the RPGexperience: battling, levelling up and exploring the relevant locations. It’s adaring approach, and one that will not suit all: but like it or not, there’s nodenying that Riviera is a unique gemof a game. By now, it should be crystal-clear that Itotally adored Riviera. In fact, Ifound myself loving it more and more as I progressed, and I was totally smittenby the time I witnessed the end—which, en passant, was utterly enjoyable withits many layers and dedication to give a nod to every character encounteredduring the adventure. It will certainly be a pleasure to come back to Riviera, especially since this istypically the kind of game that gets better with every run; in fact, I can’twait to play it again and enjoy the fighting system to the full extent of myknowledge while trying to woo lovely Serene. That will happen sooner or later,that much is sure. For now, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Hometown Story (3): Tips and tricks (to the Blue Feather and beyond!)", "date": "02/09/2014", "text": "Here comesmy third and last post about HometownStory, and it will be all tips & tricks. Because of the game’s elusive and mouldablenature, it is difficult to provide very detailed information about how to wrapup a run—let alone an exhaustive walkthrough; however, there are still somemechanics worth knowing if one wants to progress smoothly through that game, aswell as a couple of tips that can prove priceless to get out of a bind. I willtry to keep spoilers to a minimum, but there will obviously be some, which Iwill signal as such. If you want to ask questions regarding a specific matter, you're very welcome!Forstarters, here’s a brief account of my run. During the early stages, I wasabsolutely engrossed by the management of my freshly inherited shop, and Ispent most of my time foraging, buying and selling intensively. I didn’t changethe price of any of my wares, partly for fear that customers wouldn’t purchasethem anymore and partly because I didn’t want to tinker with the system.Cutscenes were scarce at that point, but I was so busy buying, selling,exploring the surroundings and assessing my new universe that I hardly noticedit. When the opportunity to expand my beloved shop finally presented itself, I seizedit with gusto; and since I had by then developed the mindset of an ambitiousentrepreneur, I decided to jump straight to the fourth and last shop expansion—theso-called ‘very fine shop’, and incidentally the biggest of them. After astimulating bit of grinding, I managed to obtain the required materials and sumof money for that purchase and my shop suddenly expanded to giganticproportions. (It was quite a shock at first sight, shall I say.) This brand-newvastness allowed me to put many more items on display and to offer a muchlarger variety of wares. The results were immediate and quite impressive:cutscenes started flowing en masse, new appetizing wares appeared in my suppliers’inventories and cash rolled in at a crazy rate. Suddenly, I could afford to buyeverything I wanted in greater quantities than ever before, and I luxuriated inthat new pecuniary leverage, selling frantically and ringing up impossibly longlines of patrons. At that point, I stopped foraging and instead adopted acomfortable routine of visiting my suppliers every other day to buy waresliterally by the dozen, often triggering a flurry of cutscenes in my wake. Lifewas good, indeed. Then I hit the Wall. I won’t detail that ordeal again since Ialready did so here; suffice it to say that after trudging and toiling to noavail for hours, I finally overcame the obstacle and completed that covetedBlue Feather. I used it to fulfill someone’s wish and then collected a coupleof extra Feathers, granting various wishes as I did so, until I was fully satedwith the process and with the game as a whole. And here I am, ready to share mywell-earned knowledge of Hometown Story’smechanics. Here we go! The CutscenesAh, thosefabled, much infamous cutscenes. They had many a reviewer seething about theirapparent elusiveness and randomness; and truth must be said, understanding whattriggers them can be somewhat challenging. However, these cutscenes do indeed havetriggers, and very well-defined ones at that. There are four different types oftriggers and thus four different types of cutscenes, and here they are, exposedfor your comfort: —The AutomaticCutscenes: These cutscenes will play without any input from you and willalways start at your shop. They unroll most often within a few second of wakingup or opening your shop in the morning, but can also sometimes happen at otherhours. Romance cutscenes fall under that category, as well as the retrieving ofrequested objects by villagers. (See the ‘Key Items’ and ‘Requests’ sections for more on thatsubject.) The motto of these cutscenes could be “When the time is ripe”: theywill happen sooner or later, but your influence on triggering them is close tonull. The only thing you can do is create the necessary conditions for theirunfolding and then wait until they do so.—The ContextualCutscenes: The vast majority of cutscenes in Hometown Story belong to thatcategory. To put it simply, those are cutscenes that unroll if you go to aspecific place in the village. In practice, it’s a tad more elaborate than that,since the time of the day and the weather can—and often will—play a part in thetriggering. The most accessible cutscenes of that category will unfold atvirtually any time of the day as soon as you walk into the section of thevillage where they take place, while the most arcane ones will require you tovisit a specific house or a far-off place—as far-off as it can be in that game,anyway—in a specific weather and/or within a very narrow time-frame. (See thesection “The Seventh Piece” for spoiler-dripping examples of suchinfamies.) It’s also worth noting that some of these custcenes will betriggered only if you have a specific item with you, usually a “Key Item” (seebelow), so it may be a good idea to retrieve any Key Item exposed on yourselves before going out for a stroll. The motto of such cutscenes could be“Poke and Probe all ’round the clock”; you have to be instrumental intriggering them, for they won’t do so until you find yourself in the rightplace at the right moment. —TheTalking Cutscenes: A very small number of cutscenes must be triggered bytalking to an NPC. These cutscenes introduce an extra layer in the triggeringprocess: instead of seeing the cutscene unroll when you walk into a specificarea under the right conditions, you will specifically need to talk to apresent NPC to launch it. This talking requirement is so at odds with the usualways of triggering cutscenes that one could seriously wonder if this is not aleft-over from development. At any rate, these cutscenes can be quite confusingbecause of their rarity: why would anyone in their right mind assume thattalking to an NPC will trigger a cutscene in one particular case when babbling with NPCs usually never triggersanything? And yet that’s the way this game is, and as annoying as it may be, itmust be accommodated. The motto of these fairly rare cutscenes could be: “If thecutscene that should have unlocked by now hasn’t, then go for the talk.” —TheItem-based Cutscenes: These constitute the other big batch of cutscenes in Hometown Story, along with theContextual Cutscenes. They unfold when you put the required Key Item (seebelow) on display in your shop—or, more rarely, a regular item. As you mayexpect, such cutscenes are much easier to trigger once your shop has beenexpanded enough to allow you to have lots of Key Items permanently on display.Just like in the case of the Automatic Cutscenes, there is an element of timingat work here: putting a Key Item on display will not necessarily trigger acutscene on the spot, but it will do so sooner or later. The motto of suchmaterial cutscenes could be: “Flaunt these baubles till the cows come home”;indeed, just be very patient, and every Key Item that is bound to be sold willattract its rightful owner eventually, along with a bunch of fresh cutscenes.   Apart from knowingthese triggers, it’s worth noting that cutscenes are never isolated: eachcutscene is part of a narrative arc, usually centered on a specific characteror group of characters. With a bit of logical thinking, it’s possible to anticipatethe content of the next cutscene in line in any given arc and to follow themost relevant course of action in order to trigger it. While this awareness ofeach cutscene’s integration into an encompassing narrative arc can be useful atany point, it is crucial in the latter stages of the game. The last arcanecutscenes that are mandatory to complete the Blue Feather indeed show perfectnarrative continuity with the rest of their respective arcs, and can be much easierto uncover if one keeps that continuity in mind and tailor their triggeringefforts accordingly. (See the section “The Seventh Piece” for more onthat subject.) The Key ItemsThe KeyItems are these precious, unique items that will allow you to unlock cutscenesand uncover your fellow villagers’ background. They all have a price tag of 300that cannot be altered and they can be accessed directly in your inventory bytapping the Key icon on the bottom left corner of the touch screen. However,it’s worth noting that not all the items lumped there are Key Items: thissection also hosts a range of items designed solely for your avatar’s personaluse, like the issues of ‘City Magazine’ that add new hair colours to the onesalready available, the fabrics that can be used to sew new outfits at Sunny’satelier, Pochica’s beloved rubber ball or the Spirit Flute that allows you totravel instantly to any place. Making the difference between the Key Items andthe items designed for your sole use can be tricky at first: I kept displayingmy massive collection of ‘City Magazine’ for quite some time before realisingthat no one was ever going to purchase them. (I wish Wada and his team hadadded another icon to group these personal belongings of sorts; that wouldcertainly have made things clearer. Oh, well.) The most important questionregarding these Key Items is obviously where to find them. Just like thecutscenes, they don’t pop out of nowhere, and there are only three ways to getyour hands on them:—The 2pmMerchant: This nondescript fellow visiting your shop dutifully at 2pm on adaily basis will be your main purveyor of Key Items in the early stages of thegame. The said Key Items always appear at the very bottom of his selection, oneor two at a time. The smartest move is to buy them systematically and storethem until their true purpose is revealed. On the next day, the merchant willhave new Key Items for you to purchase and so on, until his stock of Key Itemsfinally runs dry. Once this happens, there will be fabrics available in lieu ofKey Items, which will be a clear indication that the 2pm Merchant source is nowdepleted and that you won’t get any more Key Items from this punctual fellow. —TheVillage Grounds: A certain number of Key Items can be found outdoors,unceremoniously sprawled on the ground and patiently waiting to be picked up.The locations that welcome them are always different from the usual foragingspots but remain very accessible and visible to make sure that you won’t missanything.  —TheBabbling Way: Last but not least, some Key Items will be graciously handed toyou by your fellow villagers. Not just any fellow villager, mind you: the onesto display such convenient generosity will always be the villagers with a name,the ones you get to know through cutscenes. (They can be identified and localizedby tapping the Magnifying Glass icon on the left side of the touch screen whenyou’re outside of your shop.) As for you, you don’t even have to give anythingin return, which is even neater: the only thing you have to do is talk to them,and voilà! Another precious key Itempocketed and added to your inventory for further good use.That was itfor the sources of Key Items. Once you acquire these precious, you have to unleashtheir dormant potential, which can be done in two ways only:—By puttingthem on display in your shop, knowing that you may have to wait for some timebefore a cutscene unlocks. —By goingto a specific place with the required Key Item(s) in your inventory. In thiscase, it’s mandatory to have the Key Item with you: if you leave it in yourshop, the cutscene simply won’t trigger and you’ll have to come back later. As a whole,the Key Item business is far from being the murkiest and trickiest to handle inHometown Story. I never had any problem uncovering a Key Item—except maybe once(more on that latter). As a matter of fact, it was quite the opposite: I owned manyKey Items long before they came to use, and more often than not, I already hadeverything in stock when I had to fulfill an Item request from a fellowvillager—which, incidentally, is the perfect transition to this post’s nextsection. The RequestsAh, therequests. Dear, good ol’ requests. What would an RPG or a simulation game bewithout requests for all sorts of crazy items? Hometown Story offers a healthy amount of them, but simplifies themconsiderably. No “twenty-bear-asses” fetch quests or complicated alchemicprocesses at work here: the only things that will ever be requested by yourfellow villagers are wares—not so surprising, given your quality as the ownerof the sole shop in the village.That beingsaid, the request business in HometownStory is one that troubled many players and critics, who struggled to tellthe difference between genuine Requests and insubstantial demands. I mentionedthis before, and I will now drive the point home: the only authentic Requestsin Hometown Story are the ones thatare uttered through specific cutscenes, and they always come from villagerswith a name and a backstory (see above). Every other demand that doesn’t takeplace in a cutscene, like the ones made by customers in your shop—and that includesthe named NPCs, incidentally—can basically be ignored altogether. So don’tbother finding some fresh fish for this fine fellow that keeps asking for it,for he will very likely buy something else instead. When you’represented with a genuine Request, the next step is to find the coveted wares.Given that these wares are almost always Key Items, there are two options:either you already have them in your inventory, in which case the deed is done,or you don’t have them. In that case, they may be available from the 2pmmerchant and you should check that. If they’re not, or if you’ve alreadyplundered the 2pm merchant’s inventory and bought all his Key Items, you willvery likely find the requested wares somewhere in the village. They will eitherbe lying on the ground or be kindly given to you by named NPCs: it’s thus agood idea to run around and talk to every named NPC in sight when you have aRequest for wares that neither you nor the 2pm merchant have in store. Anddon’t forget the Sprites in the process, for they will indeed give you items atsome point. (SPOILER: for instance, one of the Light Fragments is offered toyou by the Harvest God, who only appears during rainy days at the ShrineRuins.)Once youhave the necessary Key Items to fulfill a Request, you must hand them to thevillager that begged for them in the first place. That’s where things become abit tricky: in Hometown Story, youcan’t simply walk to the person and unceremoniously shove the wares in theirhands like in any other RPG under the gaming sun. Those people have their ownlife, you know, and they are not always available to receive the wares theyasked so ardently for: you’ll realise that soon enough when you run to arequester with the items they need, all happy and elated, only to have themignore you entirely and not make any mention of the precious items. So how mustyou proceed with these picky villagers? Well, the way they utter their Request isusually the key: they will either ask you to put the requested wares on displayin your shop once you have them or to deliver them directly to their house, andyou must act accordingly. However, there is also a notion of timing involved:putting the requested items on display or running to deliver them the very sameday the quest was uttered won’t wield any result. For some unfathomable reason,Wada and consorts decided that some time should pass before you would be able tohand over the wares, typically one or two in-game days. It’s disconcerting atfirst, to say the least; but once you spot the pattern, you can relax andsimply wait for the right moment to deliver the requested items. That momentwill always come, and you can keep your business rolling in the meantimewithout a hint of worry. The Seventh Piece (Spoilers!)It had tocome to this, hadn’t it? That infamous last piece of BlueFeather, so coveted and so infuriatingly elusive. I won’t describe again thetorments of being stuck at the Seventh Piece’s doorstep, but rather give clues about how to obtain itat—long—last. As I saidbefore, getting the Seventh Piece is troublesome because therequirements to unlock it are quite hard to meet. It doesn’t help that you’renever told about them, in typical HometownStory fashion; as a result, you can meander for quite some time trying tofigure them out. Well, here they are: to get the Seventh Piece, you must first and foremost have 100 NPCs living in your cosy village. You must also unlock some specific cutscenes and obtain all the Key Items related to the fulfillment of yourfellow villagers’ future wishes—including your spouses. Note that I wrote spouses, not spouse: you must collectthe Key Items related to all the loveinterests in the game, both ladies and gentlemen, regardless of your ownavatar’s gender. This makes very little sense, and I can only imagine that itwas designed this way to simplify the programming; but at any rate, that’s howit works, and we have to deal with it.  So what arethese Key Items so precious in your fellow villagers’ eyes? Well, here’s thelist: the Powerful Magnet, the Unbreakable Chain, the Shining Sand, the MovieTickets, the Red Ore, the Boat Ticket, the Silky Silk, the Vibrant Thread andthe Crow Rock. In addition, you should have a couple of leftovers from previousquests, namely the Smudged Sketchpad, the Merit Badge, the Divine Protection,the Hero’s Sword, and maybe a couple of Dream Fragments (see the‘Miscellaneous’ section): these are basically useless but stay in yourinventory anyway, which can be a trifle confusing. As far as I’m concerned, Ialso owned a Wooden Board and the Old Magazine, but I can’t say with absolutecertainty if they are mandatory to unlock the Seventh Piece or not,since I haven’t find their true purpose yet. As for thecutscenes, they are truly the trickiest part of the arrangement. To unlock the Seventh Piece, you need to witness the closure of some specificnarrative arcs. While the vast majority of these arcs is easy to clear andshouldn’t create too much problems, there is a handful of them that feature afinal cutscene with arcane requirements: the Mika arc, theSue arc and the Rachael arc. Now, be aware that these cutscenes are not meant to be the last ones in line before getting the Blue Feather. They were the last ones in my own run, and the ones I struggled the most with; but since narrative arcs can be triggered independantly from one another in Hometown Story, your last cutscenes before getting the Blue Feather could be totally different ones. This flexibility is both the game's blessing and bane: while it allows every player to craft their own unique run, it also complicates the collection of data and hinders the creation of full-blown detailed walkthroughs, which is quite a shame. These three cutscenes may not be much information, but any piece of data is good to take when playing that game. So here they are, conveniently stuffed with spoilers: —The MikaArc: To unlock the final scene in Mika’s arc, you need to visit her at her farmat 10am on a sunny or cloudy day. She will be indoors and as you go inside, thecutscene will unroll and you will gain the Crow Rock at the end of it. I had ahard time triggering this one, for my refurbishing routine involved visits toMika’s farm only in the evening after 9pm, and this cutscene doesn’t trigger atnight.—The SueArc: The final cutscene of Sue’s arc ramps up the difficulty a little bit. Totrigger it, you need to own a Dream Fragment and to put it on display in your shop. Then, you must catch Sue when she’s at home and have her door opened. I unfortunately don't remember at which time of the day this can be done, let alone if the weather plays a part; but I remember that the time frame involved is ridiculously narrow, which considerably complicatesmatters. Before uncovering that cutscene, I had been trying to check on Sue for quitesome time, due to reasons obvious to anyone who’ve played the latter stages of the game; however,because of this ‘blink-and-you-miss-it’ time frame, I kept missing theopportunity to talk to her in private quarters. I had a growing suspicion thatI was missing something as far as Sue was concerned, and some thorough researchon internet only confirmed that intuition; and after literally standing infront of her house for hours until she unlocked her door, Ifinally managed to sneak in and to trigger that much-coveted cutscene. After that comes an ‘automatic’ cutscene: Sue visits the shop to purchase the Dream Fragment and then crafts a pendant out of it, letting you admire the result, after which her arc is closed for good. —TheRachael Arc: When it comes to arcane requirements, the final cutscene ofRachael’s arc gloriously takes the cake. To unlock it, you must go to theSecret Forest at 9pm on a sunny day. While this makes sense from a narrativepoint of view, this particular area is far from being an obvious destination,especially at night—and specifically on a sunny day to boot. Sure, there aretwo foraging spots there that could justify regular visits; but at this pointin the game, I had virtually given up on foraging, preferring instead to buybeautiful delicacies, confections and bonnebouches from my faithful suppliers. I had to dig up that particularcutscene from internet, and I’m now passing on that knowledge, hopefully togood use. Once youtrigger the last cutscene of the last narrative arc, and providing that you ownall the aforementioned Key Items and have all 100 fellow villagers living in the premises, you will finally obtain that much-covetedlast piece of Blue Feather the next morning. The credits will then roll and youwill be back to the village after your game is saved, with your preciouscomplete Blue Feather in your pocket and the freedom to grant someone’s wish.Good job!  MiscellaneousTo concludethis post, here are a few points that can be confusing and will undoubtedlybenefit from a bit of exposition. —Post-gameand extra Blue Feathers: Once you’ve granted someone’s wish, the creditsroll and the game is automatically saved, and you can immediately start to piecea brand-new Blue Feather. These extra Feathers are much easier to collect, forthe obtainment of their pieces depends solely on pecuniary achievements: to putit simply, spend a full day in your shop selling as much as you can, and youshould be granted a Piece of Feather the next morning. By chain-assemblingFeathers, you can fulfill all the available wishes without having to start anew run, as well as marry your favourite love interest. And since we’rementioning this…—Romanceand Marriage: You can’t actively woo love interests in Hometown Story: here is a game that doesn’t allow you to chit-chatromantically with potential sweethearts or to shower them with their favouritegifts to make them fall desperately in love with your amazing self. Instead, they are the ones romancing you: theywill all come to you one after the other when the time is ripe to invite you todates, before professing their undying love for your indeed amazing self andproposing to you once you have a complete Blue Feather. Your only input is toaccept or refuse their invitations to dates, and later their marriage proposal—whichalways take place during sunny days, en passant. All in all, it’s really just amenu-like situation, in which you’re presented with a variety of options andexpected to pick up the one you prefer. —TheIssue of Stealing: All Hometown Storyplayers wondered about this at some point, with a certain amount of dismay.Why are my shelves empty when I come back from a long stroll in the village? Didmy faithful customers viciously pocket my wares and walk away? Can I ever goout for hours at a time again, or am I condemned to be stuck in my shopforever, taking only short dashes outside? Well, rest assured: there is not theslightest bit of thievery in HometownStory. What really happens is that when you make customers wait too long tobe rung up for their taste, they will leave the store irritated, abandoning thecoveted item in the process. That item will simply be returned to yourinventory, where it will be available for display and sale again. —ExpansiveDainties: On a beautiful day, as I was actively inspecting my favouriteforaging spots, I found a Ruby in lieu of the usual Red Truffle. O, the joy! Ipocketed the precious and quickly run back to my shop to display it in all itsshining glory, already rubbing my hands while thinking of all the benefit Iwould get from its sale. And then… Nothing happened. The precious stood on itsshelf for weeks on end, forlorn and ignored by all. I started wondering if thiswas maybe a Key Item, until other Rubies started appearing in foraging spots,which confused me even more. But I knew HometownStory’s quirky logic and mechanics by then, and I was confident that everythingwould eventually fall into place. And sure enough, one day, an old lady steppedin and picked up the precious ruby, to my utter delight. After thatbreakthrough, that same old lady started purchasing rubies regularly, to myeven greater delight. So whathappened exactly? To sum it up, customers are inclined to spend only a certainamount of money at your shop. If an item is too expensive for them, they willsimply ignore it. But this pecuniary ceiling of theirs is bound to be raisedthroughout the game, and the sure-fire way to raise it is to shower yourbeloved customers with goods and make sure that they purchase them. Sellaffordable wares to them on a daily basis, preferably their favourite ones; andonce you’ve catered enough to their basic needs and desires for their taste,they will start buying more expensive items. — TheHidden Friendship Meter: This leads us directly to the subject of the Hidden Friendship Meter.The existence of such a feature is not surprising: affection meters are actuallya fixture in simulation games. But HometownStory chose to complicate matters by withholding any visual representationof the NPCs’ friendship meters; and while this design choice undoubtedly makesthe whole experience more organic and seamless, it also leaves the player disorientedand fumbling in the dark. (Talk about collateral damage.) But your fellowvillagers have a friendship meter all right, which fills up solely through thepurchase of wares. You can speed up the process by selling them their veryfavourite items once you identify them. (The Residents List, which can be consulted in your shop’s backroom, lists every villager's uttermost favourite item; however, they have other non-listed favourites that they will gladly purchase.) The successful purchase of such afavourite will be indicated by a flower icon displayed over the customer’s headonce they are rung up. Of course, the Friendship Meter will also fill up whenyou sell non-favourite wares, albeit a bit more slowly. That is why the sellingprocess is important and must not be neglected. Once the NPCs’ Friendship Meteris full enough, they will start buying more expensive wares (see above) andsome new cutscenes may unfold. I’m saying “may”because I can’t be absolutely positive regarding this point (blame the game’selusive nature for that uncertainty); but given the interdependency of Hometown Story’s features and gameplaymechanics, it’s highly likely that this is indeed the case. —TheDream Fragments: What a weird object indeed! This is a Key Item all right,but a highly bizarre one, for this is the only Key Item in Hometown Story that you can buy in greater quantities than needed.Dream Fragments are Sue’s exclusive turf, and she only needs a mere couple ofthem throughout the whole game; however, because her last pre-Blue Feathercutscene involves one of these fragments (see the “Seventh Piece”section), the 2pm merchant will keep selling them until you unlock the saidcutscene, regardless of whether you already own one—or several, for thatmatter. As a result, you can be left with a couple—if not dozens—of extra uselessDream Fragments when you finally clear the game, which is a funny and slightlyridiculous mishap. However, it may not be so funny in the earlier stages of thegame, when you’re trying to figure out the real purpose of these ever-flowingDream Fragments. It may even undermine their importance as a Key Item: as amatter of fact, I came to consider them as a regular ware of sorts over thecourse of my run, and I didn’t expect them to have any further influence orpurpose past their first uses in the early stages of the game, until Sue’s ultimatecutscene finally taught me better. (Ah, dearest Toybox Inc. Why didn’t youintroduce only the necessary amount of Dream Fragments, instead of a potentialinfinity of them? Oh, well. Let’s say that this is but a cute mistake, shallwe?)Gee, this wasa long post indeed! Here was all my knowledge about Hometown Story laid down just for you, and I hope it will come togood use. My attempt to rehabilitate HometownStory and convey my love for this game is coming to an end, as well as myrun of it; I’m now moving to new pastures, but I will most certainly return to Hometown Story’s atmospheric vistas and sugar-coated capitalism sooner orlater. Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Hometown Story (2): It’s actually quite good", "date": "26/08/2014", "text": "Now that I’ve debunked a couple of criticalassumptions about Hometown Story, Iwill expand further on that game’s goodness. I played Hometown Story for roughly 70 hours and milked it as thoroughly as I could, to my great delight for the most part. Those 70 hours of play were rich andinteresting, and I would like to convey that lavishness through this post.That’s not to say that this will be all roses and gilded edges: this game does have flaws, like any other gameunder the gaming sun, and I will address these too. But for now, on with thepraise!   I firmly want to believe that Yasuhiro Wadaand his team knew what they were doing when they created Hometown Story and that they designed it as a cohesive andpurposeful experience from the get-go. Some early interviews with Wada describethe game as focusing on the pursuit of happiness as well as eliciting somethinking about the different possible meanings and expressions of it. Thisfocus was so strong that the game’s codename during these early stages was“Project Happiness”. The finished product bears a different name though, andit’s not a coincidence: whether it was due to technical limitations, aninability to convey the concept efficiently, or simply a change of interest,the focus shifted from the pursuit of happiness to the development of anintegrated life in a homely microcosm. That doesn’t mean that happiness doesn’tplay a part in the process—as a matter of fact, the player spends a good chunkof their time trying to please NPCs by fulfilling their desires—but it’s beenclearly blended and diluted in the bigger picture of making it big in your cosyhometown. Atmospheric cosiness‘Cosy’ is indeed the perfect word todescribe Hometown Story. Here is agame that devotes itself to offering the player a heart-warming experience, apiece of solace removed from the agitation of the mundane world. Thistranslates into the indolent, relaxed pace that was so hissed at in reviews. Hometown Story removes any notion ofagenda or deadlines to meet in order to let the player progress at their ownpace. While this may be seen as an alienating move that suppresses any momentumand motivation the player could have to get things done—and has actually beenseen so—the other side of the coin is that you don’t have to worry aboutmissing important events or deadlines. The pressure of attending calendar-tiedevents is totally absent, and there is no such thing as a cutscene that can beaccidentally skipped in Hometown Story. Allcutscenes and events are unmissable, so to speak, and they will unfoldregardless of the time you will take to meet the requirements for triggeringthem—heck, even if you spent your first ten in-game years secluded in your shopselling stuff and becoming filthy rich before venturing outside to interactwith the locals, the cutscenes would trigger placidly and without a hitch, I’mpretty sure of that. This allows you to relax, breathe a sigh of contentmentand simply enjoy your daily game routine without getting embroiled in racesagainst the clock or time-consuming tasks. Everything will fall into placesooner or later, either when you feel ready to work for it or simply when thetime is ripe, and nothing important will ever be missed. So relax, take a deepbreath, and enjoy your stay in your lush, picturesque hometown. And indeed, enjoying the vistas is anotherimportant part of the Hometown Storyexperience. I wouldn’t go as far as to say that this game has been designed asa feast for the eyes—especially since the 3D lacks polish and precision—but alot of thought and effort has obviously been put into making the village abeautiful, lush place that caresses and soothes the player’s retina whileoffering a solid atmospheric experience. Roaming the village and drinking inthe surroundings is one of the greatest pleasures the player can indulge with:trees are lush, ever-green and ubiquitous, flowers bloom everywhere, houses arelovely and well-kept, mountains quietly watch over the village and every vistainvolving water is just drop-dead gorgeous. Combine this with a sweet, soothingmusic, and you’ll have an experience that is as charming and calming as a realstroll in the countryside. As a matter of fact, the Hometown Story village strikingly reminded me of the real-lifevillage where I spent all my holidays as a kid, which only added to itsatmospheric charm. To crown this cosy and atmospheric experience,a lot of attention was poured into the right details—i.e. the ones that canmake the heart grow fonder. And on top of the list is definitely the endearing appearanceof your wares. Wada and his team made sure that every item looked as much aspossible like its real-life counterpart while keeping them stylised enough to bekawai, and the result is incrediblyenchanting. Gems shine and sparkle, fruits look ripe and juicy, jams and juicesare glossy and colourful, and the delicatessen—o, the deli! Its looksimpossibly delicious, with its wide selection of Japanese specialities (that chirashi!) laced with the occasionalFrench onion soup or English club sandwich. It’s seriously mouth-watering, somuch so that I often found myself craving for food as I arranged these daintieson my shelves. A great deal of attention was equally poured into the weathereffects that range from dark, low skies to azure ones streaked with clouds,from the purple hazy glow of the dusk to the soft pitter-patter of the rain.Your village is indeed one with a good variety of weathers, and sunny days arefar from being the norm. I found oddly comforting to take strolls outside onrainy days, when the music would stop and be replaced by the soft sound of therain, and venturing outside in the 6.am semi-darkness on a cloudy day wasstrikingly similar to those dark winter mornings where one leaves for workearly. Last, the sound effects are crisp and pleasant to the ear, and add alayer of sensorial delight to the simplest experience: shelving item produces asoft froufrou, while picking them from the ground produces a crystallinetinkling and so on, all sounds being ultimately quite enchanting. All in all, the combination of this mellow,tension-free pace, atmospheric environment and attention to endearing details couldnearly be seen as an artistic and conceptual statement. Whether making such astatement was Wada’s original and clear intention cannot be assessed for sure,but these elements put together come across as a firm stance all the same. Hometown Story is formally original,choosing to commit to an unusual structure that could rebuff and disorientatepotential players—and actually did so. However, the originality doesn’t stophere: if Hometown Story has a boldpresentation, it is as brazen, if not more, when it comes to flaunting itscontent. Greed 'n' GrindIndeed, what do you do in Hometown Story?This subject has been curiously glossed over in reviews, to the point where onecould actually wonder if there is anything at all to do in that game. Well,rest assured: there are plenty of thingsto do in Hometown Story. The game mayappear unfocused and confusing at first because it doesn’t present a clear-cutultimate objective to reach—or smaller ones, for that matter: there are nofestivals to attend, no financial mark to reach, and in a tongue-in-cheek move,Wada&co made marriage a mere detail in the grand scheme of things, no doubttaking the piss out of the Harvest Moonand Rune Factory series that made itso important. You’re given an empty shop, basic instructions on how to arrangeshelves and items, and voilà! Therest is up to you. In a quirky, unexpected way, Hometown Story is very similar to an MMOPRG à la World of Warcraft : albeit the world to roam is only anutshell, the tasks to accomplish a handful and the foraging spots a preciousfew, there is the same feeling of setting your own goals and running forthem—or walking, since the pace is entirely up to you. This is a compellingapproach, albeit one that can easily polarise opinions or be misinterpreted.  That being said, the shop is the centralpiece of the Hometown Storyexperience. The act of selling, and by extension finding wares to sell, is notonly the main focus of the game, but also—and especially—the glue that holdseverything together and the force that drives the development of relationshipsand of the village as a whole. It’s all put together in a very clever, organicand harmonious way and can be summed up by this motto: Shop ‘til you drop andsell round-the-clock, and everything will fall smoothly into place. The wholecustcene business that worries so many players and reviewers will be taken careof without a hitch if you act like the dedicated merchant: events and cutsceneswill trigger effortlessly while you roam the village to forage and buy wares fromyour suppliers and caterers, and displaying specific items in your shop willtrigger even more cutscenes, de facto creating a virtuous circle that is asenjoyable as it is gripping and addictive. The shop mechanics themselves onlyadd to the enjoyment: it can be really giddy and intoxicating to run all aroundthe shop to refurbish shelves that empty at the speed of light during rushhours or to cash in an impossibly long line of patrons with all the financialbonuses they provide. There is a “combo” feeling to these tasks, and gettingthe longest possible line of customers while keeping your shelves full can turninto a full-blown challenge. (My personal record is 30 patrons rung up in arow). I compared Hometown Story to WoW earlier, and the comparison is aptin more ways than one: at its core, HometownStory is really just a big grinding fest. You may pick up apples and sellyummy jams instead of killing monsters, but it’s grinding all the same, andit’s the very essence of the game. Is HometownStory then just a cosy, fluffy interpretation of the “Greed is good” 80’scredo? While there is undoubtedly a ‘greedy grinding’ factor there, the game’sphilosophy and message fortunately go deeper than this. And that is when thecutscenes and events come into play and reveal their importance: they are hereto convey the idea that by fully playing your part in a microcosm, you caninfluence it positively. Your wares can make your fellow villagers happy andhelp them solve problems and progress—and by extension, you can make them happy. So yes, you’re foraging and buying andselling all around the clock and cashing in loads of money, but that’sultimately to help your fellow villagers and make them happier. The absence ofany rival shop and the fact that the money you reap cannot be used for anyother purpose than bettering your own shop are revelatory elements: this is notan ego trip, and you’re not here to become the richest cat in town à la Uncle Scrooge. You’re here to takeyour place in that world and be connected to your whole environment in aharmonious way. Your position as a pivotal part in that world is not merecoincidence: you’re a part of it, since this is your childhood/holiday village,but you’re also an outsider, since you’re just coming to live there, and thatgives you a unique insight into the situation. You’re bound to care about yoursurroundings and fellow villagers, since you’re presented as having aconnection to them, but you’re also a newcomer oblivious of the village’s rulesand mechanics—not to mention your shop’s ones—and you’ll have to learn themfrom scratch. On a more prosaic level, this explains the lack of tutorial: youhave to find your own stance in that world, explore it and interact with it tobecome a full part of it. (If you had to take over your Grandma’s shop on thefly, there wouldn’t be any tutorial popping up from thin air to explain you howto successfully run a shop, would there?) Once again, this could be seen as aphilosophical statement: Hometown Storycould be the ultimate emulation of the similar real-life experience of settlinginto a new place, learning to know your surroundings and fellow inhabitants andultimately creating your own niche there.   Hittingthe WallHometownStory is not all cuddles and fluff, though, and mylove for this game doesn’t make me blind to its flaws; as a matter of fact, a listof gripes slowly but surely emerged in my mind as I played the game. The firstone was the clumsiness of some cutscenes’ presentation: the said cutscenes arean uncanny mix of 3D models, cardboard cut-outs and text filling in the blanksto describe the action. The result is cringing, to say the least; fortunately,not all cutscenes are affected. There is also the small issue of the cosmicdisconnect between the NPCs’ regular babbling and the sometimes dramatic eventsunfolding in cutscenes: to hear your fellow villagers serve you the samewatered-down generic sentences as usual after a life-altering occurrence issomewhat disconcerting and even a tad alienating, and I really wish Wada andhis team had taken the time and energy to modify the NPCs’ babbling accordingto the chronology of events. However, these are only minor flaws thatdon’t make the game unplayable by any means; they only dent the atmosphere everso slightly, and it would be ludicrous to qualify them as deal-breakers. Butthere is one other flaw that came perilously close to being indeed adeal-breaker; and ironically, it’s a flaw that has not being pinpointed in anyreview, because it takes a dedicated and smitten Hometown Story player ready to pour dozens of hours into the gameto uncover it. Here’s the mighty flaw wrapped up in twofigures: it took me roughly 40 hours to get the first six pieces of the BlueFeather and 16 hours to get the seventh. At the heart of this ridiculous discrepancylies the ill-inspired decision of tying the obtainment of the last feather piece toarcane conditions that are incredibly hard to meet. The six first pieces of theBlue Feather are easy to obtain and are handed to you with a pleasantregularity; and while I have to admit that I don’t know precisely what the exact triggers for gaining these pieces are,it’s also true that such knowledge is not necessary since the said pieces fallso effortlessly into your lap. But the seventh piece is another affairentirely, and one that troubled many dedicated Hometown Story players: internet bristles with distress calls frompeople begging to get a decisive answer about how to unlock that infamousseventh piece—often to no avail, unfortunately. I will delve into the matter inmy next post; for now, suffice it to say that the obtainment of that seventhfeather is tied to an abstruse combination of specific items to get andwell-hidden custcenes to unlock—“well-hidden” meaning that you really have togo out of your way to uncover them. (Heck, one of them unlocks only if you goto a certain spot, at a precise hour and in a specific weather. Could you be any more obtuse?) This is a much uninspired and nearly punishing mechanic,and I can’t fathom why Wada and his team made such a poor decision. Did thefocus falter during development? Did they fail to envision the devastatingeffect it would have on the game’s flow? Devastating, yes; I stand by this. It’s notonly the issue of needing so much more time to get the seventh piece that’s atstake here, but also the much more serious unravelling of the gameplay. To sumit up, the mercantile grinding that you’vebeen using to good effect throughout the whole game to generate a wealth ofexperiences, interactions and discoveries suddenly seems not to wield anydiscernable result anymore. The flow of cutscenes dries up and becomes a trickle,new wares stop appearing, you keep selling and selling to no avail and this lastpiece of feather stubbornly refuses to make an entrance. To see the pace andmodus operandi alter so brutally towards the end of the game, de factonullifying everything the player has been learning dutifully and applying withgreat success before, is an offence that comes indeed dangerously close tobeing a deal-breaker—and actually was for a number of players. I was nearly oneof them, and only sheer willpower and an awful lot of internet research took methrough that trudge. But whether you give up or not, this last unfruitful,frustrating segment of Hometown Storyis bound to alienate you from the village, its inhabitants, your shop and thegame as a whole. Instead of following your instinct by putting whatever youwant for sale and leaving your shop whenever you fancy it to frolic around,fully confident that it will reap results anyhow, you will find yourselfcalculating, poring over every option and desperately trying everything you canthink of to make things progress. Gone is the spontaneity of the beginnings, aswell as the heart-warming feeling that you’re connected to the rest of yourworld—sadly ironic, knowing that the game’s primary goal was to elicit thatvery feeling.I think Wada and his team are fully responsiblefor this debacle. Making the last piece of the Blue Feather so difficult toobtain was a dramatic mistake, and it’s quite irksome to know that this mistakecould easily have been avoided in various ways. If they wanted to have thislast piece tied to the viewing of some custcenes, be it: but in that case, thesaid cutscenes should have been much easier to trigger. But an even more cleveroption would have been to tie the last piece solely to some pecuniaryrequirements: hitting the one million mark, for instance—with a cutscene cleverlyletting us know that this was the goal to reach. It would have been a fantasticpiece of grinding, a frenzy of buying and selling that would have crowned thegame beautifully, like the last sprint at the end of a long-distance run. Somenew wares could have been added to the mix to make it even juicier, along witha lot of interesting cutscenes to keep the player fully invested in theprocess. It would have matched the flow of the game quite perfectly to boot,given that when you reach the six pieces of Feather mark, you’re bound to spenda huge amount of time in your shop by sheer virtue of its enormous size. (My,I’m really just describing my dream vision of Hometown Story here, aren’t I?)To Wada and consorts’ defence, and to end thissection on an upbeat note, I must reassert that despite all my fuming, I do notconsider this flaw to be a full-blown deal-breaker. It certainly comes close,but it can fortunately be overcome with a lot of patience, numerous trial-and-errorsor dedicated internet research. Most importantly, it’s bound to be a first-run-onlyhindrance: once you make your way through that obstacle, any future playthroughof Hometown Story will be incomparablyeasier and smoother. Last but not least, it would feel quite ungrateful andreally unfair to dismiss the game entirely for tripping along the way after itoffered me so many hours of giddy joy. All in all, my feelings about Hometown Story remain unashamedly warmand positive, and I will undoubtedly play it again in the future. I know nowhow to make my way through the game, and I will put that knowledge to good useboth in my next run and my next post, in which I will lay down Hometown Story’s mechanics and giveuseful tips to progress fluidly.

{"title": "Hometown Story (1): Is it really THAT bad?", "date": "19/08/2014", "text": "Hometown Story, or the innocent tale of a comeback onfamiliar premises, spiced up with a zesty, tangy touch of capitalism. A gamethat promises to rekindle those childhood entrepreneurial moments spent tryingto sell discarded toys, home-baked cookies or flowers freshly pickedup from the garden to neighbours, school friends or whoever else, with a heavyload of puppy-dog looks for good measure and sales’ sake. A game that lookssweet, lovely, comforting.A game universallyhated by reviewers, and vilified in nearly every single review it elicited.Turns out that saccharine capitalism may not be so sweet after all, if thecritical cry of outrage is to be believed—but is it, indeed? Could this innocuous game really be that horrendous,that bad? Well, let’s delve into the matter. First, let’shave the usual bite of data. HometownStory was developed by Toybox Inc. and released in 2013(na/jp) and 2014(eu)for the 3ds. It has been described as being in the same vein as the Harvest Moon and Rune Factory series—so much so that its very box is emblazoned withthe caption “The Family of Harvest Moon”. However, this was mostly apigeonholing forced on the game for marketing purposes, for Hometown Story is actually quitedifferent from its elders in a number of ways. But more on that later; for now,suffice is to say that this oversimplification isn’t fair to the game anddoesn’t serve it well, driving the potential player to expect something thatthey won’t find.  Anyonewho’s been remotely interested in HometownStory’s fortunes had to notice that the game somewhat went through adownward spiral. It had been slowly but surely building some hype prior to itsrelease, thanks to a carefully orchestrated marketing campaign that saw thegame’s creator himself, Yasuhiro Wada of HarvestMoon fame, grant appetizing interviews to various medium, and the 3dscommunity was eagerly waiting for the release of this announced masterpiece.However, all that hype promptly deflated and collapsed like an overcookedsoufflé, as Hometown Story wasuniversally panned by critics the very second it was released. See foryourselves: 47% on Metacritic and 45,80% on Gamerankings. It’s bad. It’sreally, really bad. To behonest, I had been picking up the hype like many 3ds owners, and I was reallyeager to play Hometown Story;however, when these horrendous reviews started blossoming in every gaming media,I was utterly dismayed and found myself balking at the idea of purchasing thatgame that I had wanted for so long. It took a handful of glowing user reviewson Amazon to make me reconsider the idea and finally purchase Hometown Story—and boy, am I glad that I did so. I have tobe very honest here: I’ve played HometownStory at length during the last month, and I strongly feel that this gamehas been treated unfairly by critics. Reviews wereunbelievably rough towards that newcomer, which I feel is a trifleinconsiderate: when a new game formula is introduced, the least critics can dois approach it with an open and tolerant mind and try their best to identify and absorb what the game stands for and what kind of experience it wants to offer.This was not the approach favoured as far as Hometown Story was concerned, since the game was immediately lumpedwith the Harvest Moon and Rune Factory series, and came acrossunfavourably compared to these two masterpieces of farming simulation. Ofcourse, this was a blatant case of whoever was in charge of the marketingdigging the game’s grave by presenting it as something it was not; had theyintroduced Hometown Story as astandalone game with its own rules and as the possible first entry of a newseries instead of presenting it as a HarvestMoon spin-off of sorts, it would certainly have fared better in gamereviews. Indeed, to read reviews for HometownStory is a fascinating experience that reveals as much about the currentgaming trends as about the way reviews are conceived and written. It’s fair tosay that reviewers have some preconceptions and expectations when dealing witha game, and should these not be aptly met, the said game will very likely get agood beating; and that is exactly what happened with Hometown Story. I feel that reviewers over-inflated Hometown Story ’s perceived flaws in order to punish it for not having mettheir Harvest-Moonish expectations, giving the game a very unfair bit ofbrowbeating. I had no such expectations, for the sole reason that I have neverplayed a Harvest Moon or Rune Factory game; I thus approached Hometown Story as a standalone offering,a game in its own right, and suffice it to say that my vision of that game isdrastically different from the picture painted in reviews. A bit of positivewriting about Hometown Storycertainly won’t hurt, and I would like to shed a brighter light on that game,for I feel it truly deserves it. And what better way to start that byre-examining and reassessing the main critical claims about Hometown Story? I counted five of them,dutifully hammered in every single review I read; and while they may not alwaysbe wrong per se, they certainly convey a lot of, well… aggravation.Issue#1: The camera angles are horrendous and the village is way too bigLet’s start with a minor complaint, and onethat actually contains a hard kernel of truth. The camera angles are truly uncomfortable, and they tendto change so brutally and so randomly that roaming the village without gettingdisoriented or bumping into walls while relying solely on your visualsurroundings can be quite a challenge. However, this is an issue that plagues alot of 3D games with a moving camera—and incidentally the main reason why Idislike 3D games—and there is actually a reliable way to circumvent this issue:by using the bottom screen map of the current area displayed at all times, theplayer can easily orientate themselves and navigate safely. It’s a pity to haveto glance at the map every two seconds instead of drinking in the surroundings,though, especially since these ever-changing camera angles seem to have beendesigned primarily to treat the player with sweeping views of the lush,picturesque landscapes offered by the game. Oh, well.As for the supposed enormous size of thevillage, suffice it to say that this statement is simply ludicrous. The villageis made of fourteen screens of various sizes, and that’s all you’ll ever seethroughout the game; that hardly qualifies as huge in my book. If anything,it’s rather the opposite: I would have loved to be granted access to extraareas and to discover a couple of new screens to add to the now over-familiarvillage ones, but the game decided to keep it strictly vernacular and to not expandthe player’s vistas. Well, be it. At any rate, even though it may take a bit oftime to cross the biggest screens, it’s shockingly far-fetched to call the Hometown Story village “huge” or anyother related term.Issue#2: There is no tutorialHere is one claim that is totally andundeniably true: apart from a couple of sentences explaining how to positionshelves and items in your freshly inherited shop, there is no the slightest bitof tutorial in Hometown Story. Now,the question of whether this is a good or bad thing is quite debatable. Is itreally such a big problem as far as thatparticular game is concerned? I honestly don’t think so. The tasks at hand in Hometown Story are extremely basic andthe interface is fairly simple: as a result, figuring out the game’s innerlogics and learning how to operate in the game world is incredibly fast andeasy and only requires a bit of poking and probing, either with your avatar orwith the stylus. I feel that this ‘lack of tutorial’ issue is nothing but amoot point that only underlines the laziness that pervades the game industrynowadays. We’ve gotten so used to invasive in-game tutorials that savagelysever the natural flow of the gameplay that it comes as a total shock toencounter a game that lets us use our brains and figure out what must be donefor ourselves instead of brutally shoving game mechanics in our face. Well, Ilike this approach, and the gentle exploration thrill that goes with it:figuring a game’s logic by yourself is infinitely more rewarding than having tosit through millions of tutorials that you will have forgotten by the time youstart playing in earnest. I’m here to play, and if figuring out the rules andlogics at work in the game world is part of the game, I’ll take it gladly—allthe more so as, like I said, the tasks involved are fairly basic: this is no Final Fantasy Legend II, and the risk ofbeing seriously hindered or stuck because of the absence of tutorials isvirtually inexistent. Issue#3: The A.I. is off the markThis claim is but a completemisunderstanding, fuelled by anincomplete knowledge of the game’s rules. It stems solely from the fact thatwhen you talk to NPCs, either in your shop or around town, they will very oftencomment on the fact that they would like to get a certain item; however, if youput the said item on display in your shop, they will more often than not ignoreit entirely and purchase something completely different instead. While this mayindeed appear as a case of faulty A.I., it is actually nothing more than awrong assessment of the importance of the NPC’s babbling and of its relevancein the grand scheme of the game’s mechanics. It doesn’t take long for adedicated Hometown Story player torealise that these demands for this, that and the other are nothing more thanatmosphere elements, sweet little nothings that tap into the game’s trade themewhile reinforcing it. As for the genuine demands for items, which actually doexist, they are always utteredthrough specific cutscenes. There is no exception to that rule, so every otherdemand can basically be ignored, even if they are repeated over and overthroughout the whole game. (I fondly remember that old lady asking merepeatedly for a pedometer, even though there is none for sale in the game. Oh,well.)Issue#4:The triggers for cutscenes and events are unclearOnce again, this is very much a case ofreviewers not doing their homework. While the said triggers may appearill-defined at first when one is not well acquainted to Hometown Story, they become crystal-clear when enough time ispoured into the game. I’ll expand on the subject in a future post; for now,suffice it to say that there areindeed clear and well-defined triggers for cutscenes and events and thatnothing happens out of the blue. The only reason why they don’t appear limpidduring the first hours of play is because HometownStory is a game that takes time to unfold and disclose its secrets to theplayer—and that, incidentally, is the perfect transition to the fifth and last issueof the bunch. Issue#5: The game is too slow, too boring, too simpleMy, my. We are now leaving practicalgameplay issues to venture into the much rockier terrain of game design philosophy.Now, I wonder: is it really up to a critic, no matter how dedicated to theircraft they may be, to dismiss a certain type of game design as utter crap justbecause it didn’t click with them? Games come in all shapes and sizes,especially nowadays, and I feel this variety should be celebrated andencouraged. So yes, Hometown Story isindeed a game with a slow pace and simple gameplay mechanics that doesn’t pusha crazy agenda on the player. Does it automatically mean that it’s a bad game?Absolutely not. Just because a game is at odds with its era’s dominant trendsdoesn’t make it a pile of rubbish. It makes it an outsider, a differentproposition, and I feel such a stance should be at least acknowledged andrespected. Now, one has to admit that the peculiar brand of slow-motion thatdefines Hometown Story is very much ahindrance in the way of critical acclaim: most of us gamers want some fastretribution, some immediate pleasure, and most reviewers simply don’t have thepossibility to spend dozens of hours poring over a single game to uncover itsdepth and richness. But that’s the way HometownStory wanted to play, and we have to deal with it—or not, as most chose todo.So, I hope I managed to balance things andto give a more positive image of HometownStory. I feel that reviews have been quite unforgiving with that game,tramping it and giving it a critical beating that was mostly unfair andundeserved. Granted, Hometown Storymay have been asking for it by painting itself as something it was not—i.e. a Harvest Moon spin-off—and favouring suchan indolent pace, but that critical mauling was still very ungracious anduncalled for. In my next post, I will give my vision of the game, beforeoffering some tips and tricks to progress easily through it. As for now, thanksfor reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Platinum: The Empoleon Solo Run", "date": "12/08/2014", "text": "Ooops, I did it again. After inaugurating this blog with a full feature detailing the ins and outs and delights of soloing Dragon Quest IX, I indulged myself with a Solo Run once again, this time using an entry of my newest favourite game series. And boy, was it a total blast!Let’s behonest: from the moment I cleared my run of PokemonDiamond and discovered with much joy that Pokemon games could be played with a minimal amount of recruitment,I started fantasizing about a PokemonSolo Run. However, I was not planning to try it so soon. As a matter of fact,what I initially had in mind for my run of Platinumwas the exact opposite: I wanted to create a dream team of six Pokemons ofdifferent types that would fight in turn and maintain similar levels throughoutthe game thanks to regular grinding. This hadn’t worked so well in my run of Pokemon Diamond, forcing me toconcentrate solely on four ‘Mons; but I blamed this failure on my lack ofexperience and I was fairly confident that this time around, I would manage tomaintain a unified six-Mon gang. However, things turned out quite differently:despite my best grinding efforts, I struggled quite a lot to progress and foundmyself in trouble uncomfortably often, up until that fateful moment whenover-excited Barry roughed me up in Pastoria City. Huh, seriously? Why,something was drastically wrong there if Barry could get the best of me in battle.After this most unpleasant eye-opener, I called it quits, decided to start allover again and erased my save file with vicious satisfaction. Then, from thedepths of my mind exhausted by all the pampering and micromanaging I had justendured, sprouted and quickly blossomed the idea of doing it Solo. Now that wascompensation at its finest, and I dove into the process with renewed vigour andexcitement.  Before Iexpand on my fabulous Solo Run, let’s have a word about the involved material. Pokemon Platinum is an upgraded version of the Pearl/Diamond pair,released in 2008(jp) and 2009(na/eu/aus) for the Nintendo DS; as every otherclassic Pokemon game, it wasdeveloped by Game Freak Inc. and published by Nintendo. It features noticeablechanges from the Pearl/Diamond pair in terms of gameplay,storyline, graphics and general presentation, but it remains the same game atits core, albeit more polished and sparkling. Thesechanges still make the game perfectly worth purchasing: despite having played Diamond a very short time ago, I was notthe slightest bit bored by my run of Platinum.For one thing, the graphics are decidedly finer and crisper, with a higherlevel of detail and more impressive weather effects; it still remains a fairlysimple affair, but it’s definitely more complex than in Diamond. The Sinnoh climate has also been amended to better reflectits real-life model, the very northern Hokkaido, resulting in more frequentpatches of snow and characters sporting warmer outfits. The story is meatier,with extra characters and events—as well as the inclusion of a brand-new areato explore, which is every bit as dazzling and intricate as it is beautiful. Iwon’t keep detailing every single change here, but suffice it to say that thereis more than enough to offer a fresh outlook on Sinnoh.  Let’s nowmove on to the run per se. I fittingly named my trainer ‘Platine’, and justlike for my run of Diamond, Iselected a Piplup as my starter, which I also affectionately renamed ‘Piply’. Ihad chosen a Chimchar for my first aborted run, but I found the performance ofthe resident Fire starter quite underwhelming, and I didn’t feel like selectinghim again for my Solo Run. Now, as far as the Pokemon series is concerned, a Solo Run can translate into severalcourses of action because of the presence of the HM moves, from the strictestto the loosest. A Piplup can technically learn all the HM moves except for Fly,which would have allowed me to play the whole game while relying solely on thatjack-of-all-trades Water starter, providing that I erased old moves in CanalaveCity to make room for new ones; however, that would have generated a lot ofextra travelling, not to mention that I may have been stuck if more than fourHM moves were required to go through a certain area. I thus decided to stick toa looser and more forgiving canon for my run, de facto allowing myself torecruit extra ‘Mons in order to learn and perform HM moves. They wouldn’t beallowed to fight, however, and if my Piply was ever to faint in battle, I wouldconsider it a Game Over and start again. The only exceptions to this wereobviously the Double Battles, during which another ‘Mon of my roster (i.e.Ponyta, Machop, Starly, Shellos or Pachiru) was forcefully dragged into battle—kickingand screaming, as I liked to imagine it, and only to be wiped out pretty fast asthey were all dramatically under-levelled. That beingsaid, pursuing a Solo run in a Pokemon game is a bit of a blasphemy: it goes sostrongly against the core philosophy of the series that I half-feared that itwould turn out to be an unattainable feat. I felt both anxious and thrilled atfirst, and my trepidation culminated when I reached the second Gym in EternaCity and got seriously roughed up by Gym Leader Gardenia. Despite the fact thatI had grinded quite dutifully beforehand to prepare myself for that battle, herdeadly mix of Grass and Poison ‘Mons gave me a really hard ride, and my poor Piplywas knocked out time after time. It took me no less than six tries to finallybeat Gardenia, and it was a hard-earned victory: it took all the Battle Items Ihad in stock, as well as a good dose of luck, to make it through that ordeal.And remember, this was only the secondGym of the game: at that point, I seriously started fearing what lay ahead andwondering if tackling that Solo Run had not been a monumental act of hubris. However,all these fears were unfounded: after Eterna City, I was never again in troublein a Gym— or in any other battle, for that matter. More than that, I actuallynoticed a slow but very noticeable shift in the balance of power throughout thegame: as I progressed, battles became increasingly easier, and the gap betweenmy Piply’s level and the levels of other Trainers’ Pokemons grew steadilywider. At the beginning of the game, the average gap would be of ten-or-solevels, in favour of my Piply; at the end of my run, I had managed to widen itto a staggering average gap of thirty to thirty-five levels. Talk about a full-blowncanyon! The beauty of it is that apart from that initial bout of level-grindingbetween Twinleaf Town and Eterna City, I never needed to go out of my way againto level-grind: these staggering levels were reached only by fighting all theTrainers I met and by clearing all the random encounters with wild Pokemons. Atany rate, this level chasm gave me an obvious edge over virtually everyone, andthis time, I approached the Pokemon League with full confidence. I was even abit boastful, I admit that much; but for all my confidence, I could never haveimagined that it would turn out the way it did. My former visit at the EliteFour headquarters had been nothing short of a mess, prompting me to interruptmy run of Diamond; this time, I wasdetermined not to make the fatal mistake of saving between encounters. I was abit curious, though, and after stocking up a mountain of healing items, I once againengulfed into the building in order to sneak a peek at what was in stock. Butwhat was supposed to be only an appetizer turned unexpectedly into the mostepic showdown of them all. My Piply had reached Lv.90 at that point, while theChampions’ Pokemons were around Lv.65: you may imagine what happened next.  To say thatI breezed through the Pokemon League would be a euphemism: I sliced my waythrough it like a sharp knife through a soft butter pat, taking down most of myopponents in a single, fatal blow. Oh, the thrill! I only used three FullRestores throughout the whole process, and before I knew it, I was hailed asthe new League Champion. And blimey, did I feel incredibly proud and overjoyedwhen I witnessed my own crowning, all spotlights and confetti and celebratorysnapshots. Pokemon games sure knowhow to celebrate a victory and make you feel like a million! Anyway, thismarked the glorious end of my PlatinumSolo Run, after a little more than twenty hours of play. I visited the BattleFrontier just for the sake of curiosity: I first dabbled in chain battles atthe Battle Hall facility, but gave up rapidly as the process was monotonous,uneventful and nowhere near as thrilling as the Pokemon League challenge. And aftera couple of trainers implied that I had to complete my Pokedex if I wanted to beallowed to explore the rest of the island, I decided to stop there. I hadconquered the Pokemon League already, and that marked the true end of the game;everything else belonged to the post-game realm, and I was certainly not in themood to venture there if that implied chasing after every single Pokemon inSinnoh. As a whole,my Platinum Solo Run was atremendously fulfilling experience that further cemented my love for the Pokemon series. It was even better thanmy already excellent run of Diamond,treating me with a faster pace and smoother battles. It also further proves theglorious malleability of the series: indeed, the very fact that this seriescentered on collection and completion still allows the player to tackle a SoloRun—with great success to boot—is the ultimate display of flexibility andcatering to the player’s desires. I know with absolute certainty that I willsolo other Pokemon entries in thefuture—heck, maybe that will even become my favourite way of playing Pokemon games. So, thatwas my Platinum Solo Run in anutshell. It was an unexpected turn of events, but I enjoyed it to the fullestnonetheless, and discovered while doing so that the flexibility of the Pokemon series seems virtuallylimitless. I will absolutely indulge myself in the process again, o yesprecious. As for now, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Final Fantasy Legend II (3): Getting hard to play", "date": "05/08/2014", "text": "After expanding on the first half of the Final Fantasy Legend II unique formula,i.e. its sometimes puzzling complexity, it’s now time to cover the second halfof this formula, which is encompassed by a single word: DIFFICULTY.Nerve-racking, unsettling difficulty that was high then, by all 8-bitstandards, and so much higher now, in these current times of games playing onrails and RPGs stuffed with auto-battle modes.  This high level of difficulty mayoriginate, once again, from a desire to create a series as different from Final Fantasy as possible. If the original,NES-hosted entry of the Final Fantasyseries was a tad harder than its PSP remake, it was still a fairly easy RPG, inwhich field encounters were rarely threatening and boss battles could be dealtwith smoothly providing that you grinded enough beforehand. As a whole,levelling-up was a regular and measurable process that took place throughoutthe whole game and every obstacle one encountered could be overcome with theright amount of steady grinding; this was one of the most prominent staples of8-bit RPG and often translated into the old RPG wisdom that if one didn’t shyaway from field battles, one would always be powerful enough to take downbosses—and if not, a bit of extra grinding would certainly do the trick. Thingsare not as easy in FFL2, though. Thegame strays from the aforementioned ‘rewarding grinding’ staple by introducinga system of random levelling-up: instead of piling up XP after every singlebattle until your characters reach the next level, their various statsincrease every once in a while, preferably after you’ve been using certainabilities or weapons. As a result, there are no levels to speak of, and youinstead gain a certain amount of points in your various stats, including yourHP that can be raised up to 999. The specific triggers for each stat’s increaseare not crystal-clear, and I would lie if I said that I figured out entirely howthe whole system operates. This makes the levelling process far more gruellingand definitely tests your patience, as you have to soldier through battleswhile never being sure that they will reap any kind of reward in terms of statincrease. As far as I’m concerned, I found that process to be curiouslyaddictive once I got into the rhythm of it, and it’s worth noting that it doeswork beautifully when one put the necessary effort into it (I lead my wholeparty all the way up to the big 999 in the late stages of the game), but onehas to admit that it’s not exactly intuitive and user-friendly. It alsoinvolves a higher level of planning and strategy that your average 8-bit RPG asfar as levelling-up is concerned: instead of simply going with the flow andfacing ever-stronger field enemies as the story progresses, one is encouragedto backtrack regularly in order to level-up more easily, since the levellingprocess is tied to the use of weapons and abilities and not to the strengths ofthe foes. This certainly makes the whole levelling affair so much more taxing,and I can very well imagine that some players used to the simplicity of Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy in that regard were disconcerted and annoyed by FFL2’s approach. It forces the player tobe instrumental in the levelling process, to plan it and strategize it to someextent, which involves amongst other things purchasing weapons solely for trainingpurposes and backtracking in order to face weaker enemies that will have thegrace to die faster, thus speeding up the levelling process; and while this isundoubtedly a ground-breaking approach, one has to admit that it doesn’texactly make the said levelling process easier. However, there is no escape as far aslevelling-up is concerned. Whether you like it or not, you will have to grind in FFL2,and quite a lot to boot. The game dutifully respects the 8-bit RPG ‘metricpiles of grinding’ trope in that regard, and to make sure that the player won’twriggle their way out of it, it forces on the said player a deadly combinationof Sudden Difficulty Spikes and Reduced Inventory Space. That vicious combounfolds as such:—The SDS: every couple of worlds, the gamethrows at you a sudden increase in difficulty so sharp that it qualifies moreas a Mont Blanc-like peak than as amere spike. As one may expect, such peaks are usually linked to the presence ofa boss that you have to beat to a pulp in order to progress further—more onthat ominous subject later—and as one may also expect, such peaks will corneryou into forced level-grinding. To make matters trickier, these peaks arecleverly and viciously scattered along your progression in a seemingly randomfashion: instead of having to grind invariably at the end of every singledungeon to take down the resident boss à la DragonQuest, which thus allows to fall back into a comfortable grinding routine,the player never know when they will hit a wall and have to engage into a crazylevel-grinding marathon. Now that’s a way to keep the player on their toes if Iever saw one, and FFL2 shamelessly flauntsits refined, nearly sadistic mastery of it. —The RIS: as though the aforementioned Alpsof Difficulty were not enough to make sure that the player will level-grinddiligently, the game reinforces this obligation by allotting them anuncomfortably tiny inventory space that will forever prevent them to stock up pilesof powerful weapons, pieces of gear and healing items and force their waythrough the obstacle, should they have wanted to operate that way. I alreadymentioned in the first paragraph how arduous the level-grinding process couldbe, due to the particular way the stats increase; but they were alwaysloopholes at hand to allow the cunning player to reduce the amount of grindingneeded—like the fact that you can raise a Robot’s Defence stat by loading itwith pieces of armour, or the fact that some weapons can deliver incrediblystrong blows when their use counter is down to the last five or so uses, whichmakes them perfect for taking bosses down. Or rather, there would be such loopholes at hand, had theinventory space not been so ridiculously small—undoubtedly the uncanny resultof a match made in hell between technical limitations and sadistic game design.You’re granted eight slots for each one of your four characters, which have toaccommodate everything— and I mean everything:weapons, pieces of armour, healing items, spells and other abilities learnedthroughout the game, you name it. On top of this, you are allotted sixteenextra slots to keep other items and abilities—slots that cannot be accessed in battle, as one may expect. Suffice it to saythat this strict space allowance sharply hems in the gameplay by forcing theplayer to carefully consider the inclusion of every single item in thecharacter inventory, and to a lesser yet still significant extent in thegeneral inventory. As a direct—and dire—result, one has to rely quite heavily ongood ol’ level-grinding to work their way up to the top—literally. As a whole, theamount of grinding one has to put into FFL2is nothing short of staggering. I don’t think I’ve ever grinded that much while playing an RPG,not even during my Dragon Quest IX solo run: of my fifteen-or-so hours spent playing FFL2, a good ten hours were devoted exclusively to grinding—mostlyfor levels but also, occasionally, for money. To make matters worse, thisabundant level-grinding, for all the time and energy it takes, won’t turn yourparty into a team of super-buffed, nearly invincible warriors: even levelled-upto the fullest, your party will still struggle to overcome obstacles andprogress further. The most blatant example of this is undoubtedly the Boss Fights:they are hardcore, epically difficult affairs that will test your patience andsangfroid and push them to their limits. They are the kind of brutal showdownthat will wipe out your whole party and that you will finally win after anultimate, desperate attack from your last—barely—alive party member. To sum itup, those Boss battles are nerve-rackingly HARD. Of course, that also make themincredibly rewarding: taking down a Boss in FFL2is one exhilarating experience, in which pride and relief blend giddily. Neverin my gaming life did I feel so strongly that I unconditionally deserved myvictory after having toiled and sweated and ground my way through millions offield battles just to stand a chance against one of these formidable foes. Overall, making your way through FFL2 is anything but a walk in the park.If anything, it’s more akin to a trudge through a dense jungle: it’s anarduous, gruesome and often taxing process which requires a lot of toiling andreaps little reward. Never in this game will you have that pleasant feeling ofbeing powerful and able to breeze through enemy lines and slaughter bosses atease—a feeling that you could get in DragonQuest and Final Fantasy with theright amount of grinding. In FFL2,you will struggle from beginning to end in spite of all your best grindingefforts. The game makes its duty to constantly throw you off balance byvirtually any means possible: whether it be the random Difficulty Peaks, theuncomfortable lack of inventory space or the near-obligation to backtrack ifone wants to level-up efficiently, there is always something at workthreatening to tip you over the edge and making you feel at all times slightly uneasyand restless. Sleek mastery is but a sweet, distant dream when one plays FFL2, and comfort is never to bereached: every time you think you might have finally gotten a solid grip on thegame’s rules and pace and be now on solid, stable ground, there will be someform of setback to show you that you actually don’t master anything and thatthe game rules supreme. As a matter of fact, I nearly gave up a couple of timesduring the course of my playthrough, so discouraged and disheartened was I tosee my constant efforts amount to nothing in terms of mastery and to berepeatedly roughed up by the game. The only reason why I soldiered through the wholething is that I really loved FFL2,despite its relentless, nearly sadistic difficulty. I’m really glad I forgedahead, and I don’t regret a second of my time spent playing that game. I evenfound a peculiar charm to its intense difficulty: there was some oddly thrillingrealism to the whole thing, with its heavy focus on grinding and barely makingit through boss fights, and it turned this technically modest 8-bit RPG into afull-fledged epic adventure. Travelling through parallel worlds while havingnever fought in your whole life would certainly not be an easy feat to achievein the physical world, and FFL2emulates that notion with gusto, succeeding in making the player feel like a genuinehero when their quest is finally over. But for all my love for FFL2, as well as the love of other masochisticgamers that helped turning it into a cult classic of the 8-bit era, it’s hardto deny that this excellent game is anything but popular as far as the West itconcerned. And of course, it absolutely has everything to do with its deadlycombo of Complexity and Difficulty. Here is a game that doesn’t meet youhalfway, or at any other point for that matter: it’s relentlessly demanding andchallenging, daring you to grind your way through it and beat it. FFL2 is the gaming incarnation of yourtypical bratty, rebellious teenager, playing aloof and hard to get and daringyou to love them, all the while secretly expecting that you will indeed do so. Thisis obviously an approach that seduced Japanese gamers—always ready to toildutifully and to go the extra masochistic mile in order to beat a game—if theenduring popularity of the SaGaseries in Japan is to be believed. It didn’t work so well with Western gamers,unfortunately, and FFL2 remainedrather obscure in the West, to be adored only by the most dedicated andgrinding-loving RPG aficionados. However, it’s never too late to rediscovera true cult classic. FFL2 is afantastic game that manages to convey a truly enticing atmosphere despite the technicallimitations of the 8-bit era, and also affords the luxury to introduce a coupleof ground-breaking innovations that remains fresh and original even to this dayand to present the player with a fantastic challenge. It’s a true masterpieceof the 8-bit era and a genuine work of love, with all its pixels and its heartin the right places. I can only encourage any RPG aficionado to give it a try,for this is clearly a shiny, beautiful gem of a game. Thanks for reading, andbe my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Final Fantasy Legend II (2): Playing hard to get", "date": "01/08/2014", "text": "Back for the second part of my Final Fantasy Legend II analysis! As Ihinted in my first post’s title, a good 50% of the philosophy at work behind FFL2’s finely tuned assemblage of pixelscould be summed up in one word : COMPLEXITY, ladies and gentlemen. Not only is FFL2 an incredibly complex game by 1990’sstandards, but some of the innovations it introduced managed to remain freshand relevant even by today’s standards. To fully appreciate how forward-thinking FFL2 was at the time of its release, youhave to remember the context. In 1990, the Game Boy had been in operation forroughly one year and a half and yet had to produce its biggest masterpieces,especially regarding the Holy Realm of RPG: Link’sAwakening was still three years away,and let’s not even talk about the Pokemonseries, which was still deep in the recesses of Satoshi Tajiri’s brain at thattime. We may have forgotten it nowadays, in a gaming era where every newgeneration of consoles brings little more than a few hardly noticeable graphicenhancements, but back then, in the late 8-bit era, every single year sawquantum leaps in terms of graphical quality and gameplay. FFL2 is the epitome of that relentless pursuit of innovation and betterment, and one just needs to compare it to Game Boybest-sellers of 1989 like Super MarioLand and Ducktales to realisethat. Not only is FFL2 more complexthan any other Game Boy game of that time, but it also affords the supremeluxury to be more complex than most home console RPGs of that time, includingits big brother Final Fantasy. One can indeed sense that something isbrewing upon the first minutes of playing the game, when one is kindly requiredto compose their own four-member party from scratch and presented with eight models of maincharacter and six models of teammates to choose from. Talk about customization,especially in 1990! As one may rightfully expect, all these characters havewildly different abilities with various degrees of efficiency: this brings atremendous amount of variety to the fold and gives you an enormous number ofcombinations to choose from, from the sleekest to the lousiest. This allows youto tailor-make your party according to your level of mastery and/or the levelof challenge you desire, with a precision rarely equalled—even in modern games.To add an extra layer of complexity, weapons have radically different effects andproprieties depending on the character using them, which forces the player totinker and experiment quite a lot in order to learn how to operate them. Here’sone revelatory example: Guns, like all weapons, can be equipped by severalcharacters and have a limited number of uses. If you give a Gun to a Human or aMutant, the said Gun will run its course and you’ll have to buy a new one; butgive the Gun to a Robot and it can be used endlessly, providing that you sleepin some inn to replenish the use counter, and it will boost the Robot’s defencestats to boot! Well, good luck trying to figure that on your own when you’re playing for the first time. Let’s faceit: FFL2 is one of these games thatabsolutely require the reading of its instruction manual if one doesn’t want toend up horribly lost. I didn’t bother to do so at first, so sure was I that Iwould breeze through what I thought was an innocuous early-stages Game Boygame; but after a fairly long bit of uncomfortable guessing, trial-and-errorsand grasping at straws, I admitted my failure at understanding fully the rulesof FFL2 and decided to download theinstruction manual—which, en passant, is a mammoth of an essay with its 80pages bristling with information—and to my great delight, things suddenlybecame much clearer. That’s not to say that the game suddenly became a walk inthe park, for there were other obstacles to overcome; but more on that in mynext post. To further enhance the general complexityat work, non-linearity is a constant in FFL2,from the way the game world is structured to the way the player is bound todiscover and explore it. Instead of roaming a single Earth-like world withcontinents separated by oceans like in virtually every other RPG under thegaming sun, FFL2 sets you out toexplore parallel worlds set on a vertical axis, one upon another, and connectedby a tree-like structure called the “Pillar of Sky”. You get access to thatPillar and then to other worlds, progressing upwards until you reach the topand save the world—business as usual, shall we say. This concept, obviouslyborrowed from Norse mythology, is highly uncommon and a fertile ground forinteresting developments involving more complexity. It allows the introductionof vastly different worlds of various sizes, from a one-cavern world to ashogun-era pastiche, without forgetting a glorious, shiny megalopolis; thecoexistence of such different places, which would have seemed jarring in asingle unified world, is perfectly palatable in FFL2’s universe of parallel dimensions—more than that, one getsactually eager to see what kind of surprise the next world has in store. Yourprimary purpose for roaming these worlds is to recover a mass of McGuffins, andone could legitimately have feared that FFL2would play like a giant fetch quest; but thanks to the huge variety of theparallel worlds, the player is instead treated to a fascinating, thrillingadventure that packs loads of surprises and unexpected twists and turns.Instead of following the good ol’ ‘Village-Dungeon-Boss-rinse and repeat’template, the game constantly breaks the rhythm and gives you very differenttasks to fulfil in each world. You explore pleasantly various places, moreoften than not devoid of any resident boss to beat to a pulp, and get the opportunityto interact and bond with NPCs in each world, all things that give a strangelygentle and relaxed vibe to a game that nonetheless leans rather on the toughand unforgiving side of RPG. You’re also free to travel between worlds atleisure, which is quite convenient for reasons that I will detail in my thirdpost; it’s thus not uncommon to find yourself travelling several worldsbackwards over the course of a playthrough, sometimes all the way back to thefirst world, which is incidentally your home world. This is of course possiblein most RPGs, but one hardly ever has reasons to do so apart from theoccasional force-fed, story-induced backtracking, and doing so on one’s ownfree will in order to take a nostalgic peek at the place where it all started usuallyonly yields feelings of emptiness and disappointment. Not so in that game,where you always have excellent reasons to come back to your world while at thesame time being cleverly forbidden to set foot in your home village, making youeffectively a roaming outcast until your task is complete. Talk about teasing!As a whole, it’s fair to say that non-linearity reigns supreme in FFL2, making the game an intricate andlayered offering well above most console RPGs of that time, both on homeconsoles and handhelds—including, as a matter of fact, Final Fantasy.Just like a zealous ice cream parlour clerkgenerously showering your ice cream box with a flurry of toppings, FFL2 adds a great many intriguingdetails to this complex mix, making it in effect even more layered andenticing. Here are some of the yummy toppings: —Extra characters routinely join your party, making it a five-member gang, and fight by your side for a given amount of time beforetaking their leave and following their own road. On top of providing some interestingdistraction, this rather unique configuration allows you to deepen yourstrategies by using the extra character’s abilities to your advantage. —The Inn system is radically different fromanything I’ve seen before: instead of paying a fixed yet ever-rising price torest your party, you pay a pro rata amount depending on how many HP your partyneeds to replenish fully. For instance, if each of your party members lost 50 HP,your night of well-deserved rest at the local Inn will cost you 200 GP. Therate remains constant throughout the game, with one HP costing one GP. But—andthat’s where things become interesting—should your team’s HP meters be full, youcan still sleep at the inn free of charge to replenish the use counters of yourspells and weapons! That’s a very neat and fair system that lets you pay onlyfor the damage you’ve been dealt, and one that I would like to encounter moreoften in the Realm of RPG. —In a light-hearted and cheeky move, the gameallows you to change the Overworld music. Getting bored of the ubiquitous“Legacy” theme? That’s not an issue: take a stroll to the nearest bar, checkthe jukebox, and for a modest amount of money, you can select your favouritetune for the overworld. It’s not mandatory, but it’s certainly a nice touch.—The storyline is captivating andintricate, without being overly convoluted. I usually don’t care that muchabout the narrative in RPGs, especially in older ones, but this story left apleasant impression on me. It joyously blends Norse and Greek mythologies intypical J-RPG fashion and sprinkles it with a healthy dose of modernreferences, from Indiana Jones to 80’s Super Sentais. It also packs a decentamount of twists and turns, including the startling innuendo that (SPOILER)your beloved father, who you pursue through the whole game, may very well livea double life and have sired a daughter in one of the parallel worlds you’revisiting. Talk about shock value! (END OF SPOILER) At any rate, the story ismore than satisfying and perfectly falls into the whole picture of complexitydrawn by FFL2’s rudimentary yetpotent assemblage of pixels.—The game takes place in a highly unusualtype of world for an RPG, in which all races coexist peacefully. This point isnever addressed or justified in any way by the storyline and is pretty muchtaken for granted: as a result, your village and every other town bristle withall types of creatures, from robots to slime-like monsters. No racial wars andno Monsters-against-Humans trope in the world of FFL2: that’s unusual, very forward-thinking for 1990, andpleasantly refreshing. Even weirder, if you choose a non-human as your maincharacter at the beginning of the game, your parents will still be regularhumans! It feels like the game is gently making fun of the ever-present racialtropes in RPGs by throwing that racial potpourri at the player’s face andacting like it’s nothing out of the ordinary. And while this has no influenceon the gameplay, it certainly adds some originality to the game and sets itapart from regular RPGs—all the more so in 1990. So, here we are. Half of the Final Fantasy Legend II equation lies inits ground-breaking complexity, the level of which was unseen on consoles atthe time, especially handhelds. But this game is not only complex: it is alsonerve-rackingly hard, and I’ll cover that second half of the equation in mynext post. As for now, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Final Fantasy Legend II (1): When complex and difficult are a game’s middle names ", "date": "26/07/2014", "text": "My thirstfor retro games, which was awakened by my playthrough of Final Fantasy I, is not quenched yet. It’s quite the opposite, infact: peeking into that world of past glories revealed a whole richness ofgames to savour—to my uttermost delight, shall I say. Those wide 8-bit pasturesmay be a tad dry now, but they are still enticing for a European gamer thatunfortunately missed many of the best releases of that time—one of those bestreleases being Final Fantasy Legend II. Final Fantasy Legend II was developed and published bySquare, and was released in 1990(jp) and 1991(na) on the original Game Boy;like many RPGs of that time, it never reached European shores. Despite itsname, it has nothing to do with the mythical ongoing RPG series that famouslyrescued Square from bankruptcy a few decades ago—so much so that it is morelike the polar opposite of Final Fantasy,if anything. But more one that later. FFL2is actually the second installment of an independent series, and the fact thatit is misleadingly named after the FinalFantasy series in North-America is the result of a not-so-subtle marketingploy from Square: by tying that brand-new game series to the respectfullysuccessful Final Fantasy series, theycould expect a good reception and increased sales. (The first game of the Seiken series famously received the sametreatment and was renamed Final FantasyAdventure for its north-American release.) Anyway, Final Fantasy this is not: the original name of FFL2 is SaGa 2: Hihou Densetsu, i.e. SaGa2: The Treasure Legend. The SaGa series is a highly interesting onethat deserves a bit of development. Born in 1989 with the release of Makai Toushi SaGa on the Game Boy(rebranded The Final Fantasy Legendin North-America), it counts nine games, spans three generations of consolesand is still ongoing nowadays, albeit at a quite placid pace. What fascinatesme the most about SaGa is the factthat despite boasting some respectable longevity and being the offspring of thehighly respected Square, it has always been a very confidential, nearlyunderground series as far as the West is concerned, never reaching the peaks offame claimed by other Square offerings like the Final Fantasy and Seiken Densetsu series. However, SaGa is quite popular in its homecountry, which prompted Square Enix to release DS remakes of FFL2 and its sequel, the aptly (re)namedFinal Fantasy Legend III, in 2009 and2011—needless to say, these remakes never graced our shores and probably neverwill. Oh, well. Anyway, the idea of discovering a relatively unknown offeringfrom Square is a strangely compelling one: how on earth can a two-decades-oldseries from one of the most renowned game developer under the Eastern gamingsun be so utterly confidential? Well, there could actually very good reasons forthat, if the whole series follows the template and philosophy of FFL2.It’s hardnowadays to find any relevant information about the rationale at work behindthe creation of the SaGa series inthe late 80’s; but I wouldn’t be overly surprised if the series had beendevised from the get-go as a polar opposite of the Final Fantasy series. The first two installments of Square’s mostfamous and beloved franchise had been released by then, to great criticalacclaim, and they had established a template of sorts for the series theybelonged to—as well as for the 8-bit RPG realm as a whole, for that matter. Arather simplistic template it was, however, that didn’t allow for muchcomplexity and non-linearity, but was so successful that it was unthinkable toalter it in any significant way in future installments. If Square wanted toindulge into developing a more elaborate and layered gameplay, the onlyalternative was to create new series with different rules; and this is verylikely how the SaGa series was bornin 1989. FFL2 is so radically different from Final Fantasythat it nearly comes across as a tongue-in-cheek parody of Square’s ubiquitousbankruptcy-rescuing series, a light-hearted attempt at subversion that gentlytakes the piss out of everything FinalFantasy stands for. The decision to rebrand the game as a Final Fantasy-related offeringinvoluntarily adds an extra layer of irony to the situation; I smile ruefullywhile thinking of all the poor souls who purchased this game while expecting anexperience similar to FF1 or FF2. Whether they ended up beingsupremely disappointed or pleasantly surprised is left in the limbos of videogame history, but one thing is sure: what you’ll get by playing FFL2 is an experience like no other,even to this day. Beforediving into analysis, I feel compelled to express my innermost feelings aboutthat game. To put it simply, I really adored FFL2. It provided me with a game experience much deeper than I hadexpected—in fact, it’s fairer to say that I was amazed by this game’sunexpected depth and elated by its sheer originality. I certainly got more thanI bargained for in these two departments, as well as in others, includinghead-scratching complexity and nerve-racking difficulty; but more on thatlater. When itcomes to graphics, the game is decent enough and on par with the releases ofthat time, at least when outdoors are concerned. Indoors visibly got a bit morelove: some temples are particularly beautiful with a high level of detail, andthey manage to create a truly engrossing atmosphere; the gateway between thedifferent sections of the game world is also quite stellar, in more ways thanone. It’s also worth noting that despite being mostly unspectaculargraphically, FFL2 is totally devoidof any kind of glitch in that department: there is not the slightest hint of flickering—anaffliction that famously plagues other Game Boy cult classics of that time, like Ducktales or Gargoyle’s Quest— nor is there any kind of slowdown or skippednotes in the music. And talking about the music, it’s just splendid. The maintheme, which is called “The Legacy” and plays when you’re roaming theoverworld, is a gorgeous and intoxicating piece of ear candy that gloriouslyevokes a sense of freedom and adventure. The rest of the soundtrack is fantastictoo, with themes offering a wide variety of moods ranging from peaceful touneasy and stressed. There is a certain grandeur to that soundtrack, whichdoesn’t feature any cheesy, bouncy or mellow track: your typical village theme,for instance, is totally absent, and you instead keep hearing the heroic notesof “The Legacy” every time you set foot in a town. All in all, when it comes tothe overall presentation, this game is a typical 8-bit offering, albeit with atop-class music that shines despite the technical limitations of that time. Ithas this very special 8-bit charm that retro gamers love so much and that canhardly be described in words: an enticing blend of forced simplicity and ravenousenthusiasm to always try new things. And try new things it did, indeed: if FFL2 hardly pushed graphical and sonicboundaries except in a few selected spots, it certainly did so when it comes togameplay, o yes precious. I’d love toelaborate on this boundary-pushing, but I won’t do so right now. See, I wasinitially planning to write a single post about that great game, but I quicklyrealised that this would turn out to be a very long and stuffy post indeed. Ithus decided to cut it that huge cake of a post in three slices to make iteasier to digest, and I will now wrap up the first one of these slices. In thesecond post, I will elaborate on the complexity of FFL2, before tackling its difficulty in the third and last post. I’llbe back soon! As for now, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Gaming Haul: Summer games ‘14", "date": "22/07/2014", "text": "I wasabroad on holiday lately, hence the lack of any new post these last threeweeks. Despite my best attempts, I hardly managed to write a couple ofparagraphs, let alone a full article. However, I did stay tuned into gaming,both in terms of playing and purchasing, and my trip ended up being quite a fruitfulone in both departments. When itcomes to playing, I firmly intended to maintain a healthy diet of daily gaming,and I managed to stick to it, to my great delight. (Not that I had to forcemyself too much, as you may expect.) These special circumstances called forspecial games: given that I was not on my usual premises, I wanted somethingfairly laid-back and relaxing that wouldn’t request too much brain-racking andwould fit into the whole ‘lazy holidays’ picture. After a bit of pondering, Ielected my newly imported copies of HometownStory and Pokemon Platinum as mygaming material for this trip, and it’s fair to say that they played the partbeautifully—and so did I. But more on that in future posts. For now,let’s concentrate on the purchasing part of my trip. I had access to a choiceof games much larger than the one I’m usually offered, and I used this greatopportunity to the fullest by reaping a handful of games that had caught my eyeand my interest lately. Here are the lucky winners that were granted awell-deserved place in my precious, ever-growing collection:Pokemon X&Y (3ds): Now that I’ve become a proudPoke-aficionado, I couldn’t let these two pass me by. I bought the pair, ofcourse; what else could I have done? Choosing between these two mightyLegendaries was just impossible. I will probably shelve them for a while,though, given that I’m planning to play the other DS entries first and foremost…Unless a sudden urge to tame Xerneas and Yveltal takes over, of course. Mygaming instinct is one wild, unpredictable beast!Animal Crossing (3ds): I hesitated a fairly long timebefore purchasing that game; and to be honest, even to this day, I’m not quiteconvinced that this is the right game for me. I like my games to have somesolid sense of purpose, some ultimate goal to reach, and I’m not quite surethat taking massive loans to fancy up my village and make my house Ikea-perfectand then spending hours collecting money to pay my colossal debts areobjectives juicy enough for my taste. Oh, well. Time will tell!Luigi’s Mansion 2 (3ds): This one is actually not apersonal purchase, but rather a gift of sorts from my sister, who purchased itbased on stellar reviews only to realize after a few playing sessions that shedidn’t like it. This is not a game I would have bought on my own free will, soI’m quite curious to try it and see how it will turn out. Gravity Rush (Vita): This game interested me for a number ofreasons. The gravity gimmick is original and worth trying, the main characteris refreshingly different from the ones you usually control in this type ofgame, the neon-colors-meet-steampunk art direction pleasantly reminds me of themovie Dark City, and last but notleast, there is a cat involved, and I just can’tresist cats. All this promises a very good experience indeed, o yesprecious. I only hope that the gameplay is not similar to the Tomb Raider series, forcing you toconstantly perform insanely hard jumps and acrobatics, or my fun could beseriously ruined. Hyperdimension Neptunia: Producing Perfection(Vita): I’ve readmixed critics about this game, ranging from stellar to derogatory. What Iextracted from that uneven bunch is the notion that Hyperdimension Neptunia PP is a game that can be appreciated to thefullest only if you already know the eponymous series quite well—which I donot. However, my gaming instinct imperiously toldme to buy this game anyway, and I happily complied. Blame it on the summer, butI’m in the mood for some moe and kawaisa indulgence these days. On top ofthis, I had the opportunity to visit a second-hand electronics shop. And what didthey have in store, nested somewhere between so-90’s digital alarm clocks anddusty CD players? Well, you guessed it: video games, of course. Game Boy andGame Boy Advance cartridges, of all things! Now, when one is hunting for games,shopping in a non-specialized second-hand store is the trick: since the ownerusually doesn’t know that much about games, one can find rare and valuablesofferings at a very fair price. It was the case in that shop, where all thecartridges cost 5 euros/$6,5 each; and sure enough, I managed to extract ahandful of gold nuggets from what was mostly a mine of crappy licensed turds.The happy few rescued that day with the promise of a happy and peaceful secondlife (or third, fourth or even tenth, who knows) were Shining Soul 2 and AdvanceWars 2 for the Gameboy Advance, as well as Super Mario Land for the Game Boy; but the most glorious purchasesof the day were undoubtedly Pokemon Blueand Pokemon Yellow for the Game Boy,in great condition and with the batteries still working to boot. Oh, the joy! Imay thus indulge in retro Pokemon entries much earlier than I’d expected, whichis quite a pleasant development. So, thiswas the loot that I proudly brought back home from my lounging on foreigngrounds. All these games will be played when their time is ripe, and hopefullythe next trip abroad will be as rewarding as this one when it comes to gamepurchases. I will come back soon with meatier reviews; as for now, thanks forreading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Diamond (2): The bare run ", "date": "26/06/2014", "text": "Back for more beastly action! I will nowelaborate further on my run of PokemonDiamond. Before even starting to play the game, I wanted the said run to becharacterised by two words: simple and basic. I wanted my first foray into the Pokemon universe to be a pure andbare-bones one, during which I would focus solely on the fundamentals. I wantedto play it my straightforward way, and that’s exactly what I did; and I’m nowgoing to dissect that oh so basic run in front of your very eyes. By detailing my run, I hope to offer adifferent view of how Pokemon gamescan be played and a new insight into the depth and flexibility of the series. Ihave no doubt that I am not the only gamer who dutifully avoided the series formany years due to its heavy focus on completion and collection, thus deprivingmyself of many hours of fun without even knowing it; and if I can change themind of such gamers and lead them to give a try to the series by showing that Pokemon games can be played and enjoyedwithout any sort of collection galore, then I’ll consider my gaming deed of theday to be done. The rules of the runI jumped head first into Pokemon Diamond without any priorknowledge of the rules of the Pokemonuniverse; the only things I was vaguely aware of was that there was a strong notionof elemental complementarity at work, and that the battle mechanics could beincredibly complex. I had seen some headache-inducing tables about the amountof damage dealt in battle by every type of Pokemon, browsed some threads aboutbattle strategy that read like esoteric writings, and had my brain whirlingwhile discovering the enormous amount of data available about every singlePokemon on Bulbapedia; all things that could have legitimately convinced me todo my homework before diving into Diamond.However, I was not inclined to read any strategy guide or FAQ; I usually usethese only when I’m totally stuck or when I clear a game and want to get adeeper insight into its secrets. I thus decided to proceed as usual and to relyentirely on my gaming instinct, trusting that my experience as an RPG veteranwould allow me to navigate safely and ease my way through Sinnoh—and throughthe Pokemon universe as a whole. My first goal was to focus mostly onexploring and discovering the Sinnoh region, along with uncovering the story.My expectations regarding the narrative side were not quite met, as I explainedin my last post, but I certainly got my fill on the exploration side. Sinnohmay be tiny, but it was a real joy to roam it and make it my own. The sweet andgentle vibe of Diamond greatlyreinforced the pleasure I took in discovering that world: this is by far theleast stressful RPG I’ve ever played, and it’s just delightful to take a breakfrom your usual foe-laden, hazardous RPG once in a while and play something truly relaxinginstead. But the meat and potatoes of Pokemon games is not the exploration ofthe local region, however charming and enjoyable this process may be; it’sobviously the recruitment of Pokemons. (I know that technically, this is morelike capture and enslavement; but my soft gamer’s heart prefers to see it as arecruitment of sorts, and imagine that ‘Mons allow me to catch them becausethey want to join me.) With respect to that bread and butter of the Pokemon series, my stance was one of apotential adopter who would visit an animal shelter and check all the animalsuntil they find one with which they click instantly. I wanted to base myrecruitment solely on my instinct and gut feelings about the ‘Mons I encounteredon the field. If practical thinking was needed at somepoint, I would act accordingly, but the main motto was definitely: “Awww,you’re so adorable! Come into my Pokeball!” With such guidelines, it shouldn’tsurprise anyone that I ended up with a team of ‘Mons that closely resembledreal-life animals. Let’s now expand on the run per se! I ground it my wayHere is the basic data about my run. I fittinglynamed my trainer ‘Diamond’ and selected a Piplup as my starter, which Iaffectionately renamed ‘Piply’. I encountered 140 Pokemons (counting evolvedforms) on the field and during my battles with trainers, of which I captured 10:Shinx, Goldeen, Ponyta, Stunky, Magikarp, Happiny, Shellos, Starly, Sneaseland finally Dialga. I subsequently freed Goldeen, Stunky, Magikarp, Happiny andDialga, which was really heartwarming; I only regret that the game didn’t treatme with a small animation of them returning to the wild. Oh, well. My finaldream team comprised four ‘Mons: Piplup aka Piply, who became a proud Empoleon;Shinx, who evolved all the way up into Luxray; Ponyta, whoover—considerable—time became a fiery Rapidash; and, last but not least,Sneasel, who remained that way because I couldn’t get my hands on the specialitem needed for that Pokemon’s evolution. You’ll notice that I used thedeterminer “who” instead of “which”, against all grammar sense, and that’sbecause I grew really attached to my ‘Mons over the course of my playthrough: theywere partners and friends to me, not just mere enslaved animals. These fab fourwere great troopers ready to tackle any battle; I let them fight in turn and bythe time I finished my run, they had all reached a respectable level 50. I alsohad two supporting team members, namely Starly, later evolving into Staravia,and Shellos; these two didn’t take part in battles and their sole purpose wasto learn and perform the moves ‘Surf’ and ‘Fly’. To wrap up that exposition,here are a few details that puzzled or amused me:—I didn’t meet a single wild Pikachu. Couldthe ubiquitous mascot of the series as a whole actually be a super-rare Pokemonin the games, or at least in this one? Well, I certainly didn’t expect that. —On the contrary, enrolling Dialga was atotal breeze, thanks to a special Pokeball with a 100% catch rate provided abit earlier in the game. I’d have thought Legendary Pokemons would prove to bea much harder catch—so much so that I didn’t expect for a single second to be ableto catch the resident Legendary of Diamond,while I was totally sure that I would get my hands on a Pikachu. You never knowwhat life has in store for you, let alone Pokemongames! Anyway, this 100% catch rate Pokeball seemed like a cheap trick, and Inever felt like using Dialga in battles: it seemed really insulting to forcethe Time Pokemon itself, co-creator of Sinnoh, to take part into something aspetty as a battle against a wild ‘Mon or a belligerent trainer. Out of respectfor that mighty beast, I freed it after some time; it deserved to be out there,roaming the very world it created, rather than squeezed into a Pokeball. —Since the booklet encourages you soexplicitly to choose your trainer’s sex in accordance with your own, I expectedsome kind of romantic development to take place at some point, most likelybetween Professor Rowan's young assistant and yourself. However, nothing of thesort happened, which makes me scratch my head and wonder what was the wholepoint of that initial advice. Weird, indeed. Or maybe I’m just too old toponder how much of a trauma it would be for a child to play as a characterwho’s not of the same sex as they are? Poor thing, that could obviously teartheir very soul apart. (Insert sarcastic smile.)—Diamond gives you a so-called 'best friend', in the most tsundere sense of that word—understand, an over-excited wannabe trainer with an strong inferiority complex that he tries to overcome by constantly daring you to fight him. I took an undeniable pleasure into beating himto a pulp every time he foolishly challenged me that way, claiming that he was thestrongest. Ha! You don’t know what you’re getting yourself into, you fool! Iguess Diamond woke up the childishstrike in me, making me enjoy this kind of silly competition again, if only fora short period of time.After this juicy slice of trivia, let’s laydown a wider picture of my run. As I said, I stuck to the basics, dutifullyignoring all the mini-games that were thrown regularly at my face to distractme from my somewhat arid path. I didn’t dress my ‘Mons with accessories, Ididn’t enrol them into any weird Pokemon pageant, nor did I walk them into thepark. (Not that I could have, anyway: they were deemed not ‘cute’ enough todeserve that walk. Well, be it.) I only cooked a couple of Poffins to treatthem with, which was rather funny and relaxing, and fished just enough to catcha Goldeen and a Magikarp. When it came to battle strategies, I decided from theget-go that my fighting team would count no more than six ‘Mons, but it turnedout that even this modest number of beasts was too complicated to manage onceon the field, which prompted me to concentrate solely on my Fab Four. As aresult, my elemental options were obvious limited, which thus lead me to resortto that good ol’ fixture of RPGs: Grinding, ladies and gentlemen. I ground myway through Sinnoh, tackling patiently every single battle, crushing everysingle one of these pugnacious trainers who dared to challenge me. It was hardat times, but I always soldiered on, earning the eight Gym badges and finallyreaching the coveted Elite Four Headquarters. This ominous building was loominglarge over me, daring me to engulf into its depths and challenge the residenttrainers—which I did, of course. However, I did so in the most reckless way. I wentin without stocking any vital items, just to sneak a peek and get a firstimpression; I beat the first Champion with great difficulty, and then saved myprogress before realizing that I couldn’t leave the room and refurbish or healmy ‘Mons, basically painting myself into a corner. I tried forging ahead andbeating the second Champion, but it became painfully clear that I would run outof items before I could beat all of them, so I basically quit playing at thatpoint. I could have let the Champions batter me in order to escape that messand get the opportunity to refurbish and grind a tad more, but I was notinterested. At that point, I had been playing for 35 hours and I felt like Ihad gotten my fill of Pokemon actionfor the time being. Next time, I will prepare better and take these mightyTrainers down, I swear. For indeed, there will definitely be a next time, andmost likely several of them: I’m not done with the Sinnoh region, and I’mcertainly not done with the Pokemonseries as a whole. That sweet lingering feelingIn fact, my run of Diamond may very well be the beginning of a long and solid lovestory. I didn’t have a thundering crush on that game like I did on all-timefavourites of mine like Avalon Codeor Link’s Awakening; this is more ofa softcore, slow-burning affair that is slowly but surely growing on me. My runof Diamond left me with a sweet andwarm feeling that gently flows back into my mind every time I think about thegame. I loved the gentle exploration and the relaxing atmosphere; combined withthe utter freedom I was given regarding recruitment and fighting, it makes Diamond a deliciously fulfilling andgratifying experience. Granted, it is not the most amazing or thrilling gameI’ve ever played: the pace is slow, the fighting system is quite dated andfights can sometimes drag on painfully, and it can be really grindy at times; andyet, this game is incredibly memorable in its own soft, tender, non-invasiveway. It nested into my gaming memory and carved itself a niche there—a verysoothing, comforting and heartwarming niche, shall I say. Even restarting thegame to collect my data for this post felt like coming back to a familiar andwelcoming place, and I actually felt very much inclined to restart aplaythrough right on the spot. However, I will not succumb, for I havejuicier plans in mind: I’m definitely going to purchase and play more Pokemon entries, starting with the DSones. On the long run, I may very well purchase every single episode of thefranchise; for despite not having a completionist style of playing when Iindulge into games, I am indeed very much the collector and the completionistwhen it comes to game series. Talk about irony! At any rate, I’m sure I willgrow to love the series more and more as time goes on and games are played. I’malso quite sure that the best is yet to come, especially when one knows that Diamond and Pearl were far from being deemed outstanding entries in thefranchise. From what I’ve read, they were rather criticised for their lack ofinnovation and outlandish roster of ‘Mons, and were perceived as a low point inthe series. Many stated that Pokemonhad lost its edge and was starting to grow stale, and Platinum didn’t change the series’ fortune significantly; only thesubsequent release of the Black/White pair turned the tables,revigorating disappointed Poke-aficionadosas well as the series as a whole in its wake. Knowing that, it’s fair to assumethat if I loved Diamond despite itssupposed lack of greatness, then surely I will adore entries that are deemedbetter. So, I have grandiose plans about the Pokemon series, and it thrills me tothink about the countless hours of joy that lie ahead. My immediate plan is topurchase the Black and White versions, along with their sequelsBlack 2 and White 2, as well as SoulSilver/Heart Gold and Platinum. Pearl is not on my buying list rightnow, but I will certainly purchase it sooner or later, especially if I decideto collect the full series. I’m done with Sinnoh and the Pokemon series for now, but I will be back—and quite soon at that,if my current craving for more Pokemonaction is to be trusted. As for now, thanks for reading, and be my guestanytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Diamond (1): A late discovery", "date": "17/06/2014", "text": "After allthese years, I’ve finally tamed the beast. Or should I rather say the beasts? Youguessed it: for the first time in my gaming life, I played a classic Pokemon game. Better late than never, asthey say. The reasonswhy the Pokemon series eluded me allthese years are twofold. The first of them is that when the series reachedEurope in the late 90’s, it was heavily marketed towards children and camealong with all sorts of unsavory commercial tie-ins that blurred the pictureand somewhat took the focus away from the games (so much so, in fact, thattheir RPG nature was then unknown to most, including myself); given that I wasa young adult at that time and thus not the main target, I basically ignored theseries altogether. Much later, when the initial craze cooled down, the focuscame back to the games themselves and their RPG glory could finally shinebrightly and unhindered. Learning that Pokemonwas actually an RPG series naturally piqued my curiosity and interest; and yetI still didn’t dive into it senselessly, for it seemed to me that the coremechanics of the series were completely at odds with my gaming interests. I’mneither a completionist nor a collector, so the prospect of playing a gameentirely based on these two principles didn’t thrill me the slightest. In fact,the very idea of having to collect the hundreds of Pokemons available in everyentry felt more like a dreadful chore than an exciting challenge, which is thesecond reason why I shied away from the series even after becoming aware thatit belonged to my favourite gaming genre. But not solong ago, I started reconsidering my position about the Pokemon series. My gaming experience, and more specifically my Dragon Quest IX Solo Run, taught me thatthere is always a certain amount of latitude in the way games can be played.Not only that, but my playthrough of PokemonMystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity showed me brilliantly that it wasperfectly possible to play a Pokemongame without having to put up with any sort of recruiting galore. Thisdefinitely tipped the scales, and I decided to try a classic Pokemon game and see if I could, well,play it my way. Quitethrilled by the prospect of discovering such a huge franchise, I settled for aDS game for starters. I didn’t want to go all the way back to the Gameboy days,nor did I want to risk stumbling on a Gameboy Advance bootleg, and I was evenless inclined to go for the brand-new 3ds entries, whose high prices were notreally fit for a first try that could prove disappointing. I wanted to play itsafe, and the sole reason why I finally elected Pokemon Diamond as my very first foray into the franchise was becauseof all the Pokemon games I browsedwhen I made my purchase, my now copy of Diamondwas the cheapest. I’ll go on witha few words about the series, even though I’m quite sure it doesn’t needintroduction. All Pokemon games weredeveloped by Game Freak Inc. and published by Nintendo and covered fivegenerations of consoles, from the original Gameboy to the 3ds. The canon Pokemon games always remained onNintendo handheld systems; some occasional spin-offs were released on Nintendohome consoles, but the franchise always remained a portable one at heart. Ifind interesting that all the classic games contain the word “version” in theirtitle—the only exception to this being the newly released X&Y pair. It’s not just PokemonDiamond, but rather Pokemon DiamondVersion; this gives the curious feeling that all Pokemon entries are only variations of an original formula bound toremain the same at its core. As for what this formula would be, we’ll see thatright away.Completion, collection and childhood. Pokemon is a game series that strives oncompletion and collection and makes no effort to hide it. It’s quite theopposite, in fact: the series wears this otaku-ish vibe of maniacal collecting likea badge of honor. Let’s not forget that the series is the brainchild of SatoshiTajiri, who used to collect and classify insects as a kid and wanted toreproduce and emulate that process in a virtual form via the creation of Pokemon. It thus shouldn’t surpriseanyone that Pokemon games centermainly on collection and completion and make all the necessary way for theseprocesses to unfold.Pokemon Diamond perfectly illustrates this. As the gamestarts, you are promptly asked by the resident professor, expert in all thingsPokemon but apparently too lazy to pursue his own research himself, to departfrom your quiet village in order to roam the game world (i.e. the Sinnohregion, based on the Japanese region of Hokkaido) and gather as muchinformation as you can about Pokemons. You are given a database called Pokedexthat you must fill with information about the ‘Mons you encounter and fightand/or capture, and explicitly encouraged to capture as many of them as youcan. “Gotta catch ‘em all”, remember! And fill that Pokedex while you’re at it!Apparently, child slavery was not abolished in Sinnoh—nor was animal slavery,for that matter. Oh, well. You get the idea: your goal is to travel, explore,fight and capture Pokemons, preferably all of them. I was actually quiteshocked by the lack of importance given to the narrative elements. There is nostory to speak of and no ultimate goal to reach story-wise: the goal is purelyand simply to catch all the available Pokemons, and everything story-relateddoesn’t have any other function than to provide some embellishment to this collectingquest. It’s even below the level of your average dungeon-crawler, where thestory is here to give you an excuse to roam dungeons; Pokemon Diamond tells you loud and clear to go fetch ‘Mons in thefirst place and then sprinkles your quest with occasional bits of narrative toadorn it somehow. For instance, you quickly encounter a team of villains withtypically dark schemes determined to hinder your progress. I totally expected anepic showdown at the end of the game, during which I would take them down inclassic RPG fashion; but that is not the way things unfold in Diamond. Instead, you defeat thesebaddies long before the end of the game and then go on with your quest asthough nothing happened, which confused me a trifle. Oh, well.Anotherdistinctive aspect of Diamond, andprobably of the whole series, is that it’s aimed primarily at children. This isobvious from the get-go: the main character is a kid living with their mother,and the instruction manual explicitly encourages you, in what I can only describe as an annoyinglypatronizing way, to choose your main character so that their sex will matchyour own. This child focus continues to shine through the whole game: thebaddies are laughing stocks not the slightest bit threatening, running gags areabundant and you are constantly treated with all sorts of mini-games. Let’salso mention that the Sinnoh region is quite small and gives off a verywelcoming vibe, with everybody being incredibly friendly and kind towards you. Thegameplay was also visibly designed with children in mind. Unlike every otherRPG under the gaming sun, Diamondwon’t force you to pay in order to rest your wounded Pokemons: this is all freeof charge, and you can use and abuse it at will. Random encounters are limitedto some specific areas, namely the grassy ones, allowing the player to avoidthem if they wish to do so. You are assured not to get lost in any way: intypical Zelda-like fashion, yourprogress is canalized by some physical obstacles bound to be overcome later inthe game, giving a gentle exploration thrill to the whole process. There is ofcourse no such thing as permadeath, your Pokemons simply ‘fainting’ instead iftheir HP falls to zero; nothing that a free-of-charge rest as the nearestPokemon center can’t fix. The captured ‘Mons can be released at any moment, sothere is no such thing as permanent animal enslavement. (I actually loved thatfeature and used it a couple of times, and I always got a warm, flutteringfeeling in my chest when I freed a Pokemon.) All in all, Diamond is a sweet, relaxing and lovely RPG with a domestic vibe,in which you explore your own tiny, friendly world at your leisure.This heavyfocus on completion and collection and this softcore youthful vibe are stronglyreinforced by the art direction of Diamond.To put it simply, this game is graphically and musically nondescript. Graphicsare simple and basic, with clear-cut lines, a general roundness to everything anda low level of details. Pokemons and characters are drawn in a generic stylethat doesn’t show any further stylization than the one you encounter in youraverage anime, which somewhat shocked me: I expected such a huge franchise toat least sport a very distinct, specific graphic style, but this is not thecase. As for the music, a single word sums it up: Elevator. Diamond’s soundtrack is a glorifiedcompilation of the finest elevator music you can think of, declined in alounge, jazzy or ambient mood depending on the setting and the circumstances.This soundtrack is actually quite huge and offers dozens of tracks that caressand soothe the ears while being unobtrusive and blending in the background. Iwas rather fond of it: I thought it was a nice change from the usual epicthemes prominent in RPGs. This mellow soundtrack and simple graphics greatlyenhance the sweet and childish vibe of Diamond,which was very likely their primary purpose. By being basic and somehowunthreateningly nonspecific, they also allow the player to concentrate fully onthe main purpose of the game, i.e. collecting ‘Mons like there’s no tomorrow. Amore complex combination of sound and graphics may have distracted the playerfrom that goal: let’s be honest, the task of collecting the hundreds of beastsavailable in this game is already daunting and massive enough not to troublethe player further by forcing sensory overload on them. This is especially truefor kids, who remain the primary target of the series, but can also apply toadults. I’d rather have the mellow and somewhat forgettable soundtrack of Diamond rather that a sweeping one thatwould grate on my ears and nerves after a couple of loops. As for the graphics,well… They are an acquired taste as far as I’m concerned. I would have loved amore stylized and elaborate take on them, at least initially, but I learnt tolove them as time went on. That oh so well-deserved fameThe Pokemoncraze of the late 90’s cooled down long ago: the card game sunk into the depthsof oblivion, the TV show was kicked away by fresher contenders like One Piece andNaruto and the products adorned with Pikachu&co disappeared from storeshelves. However, the games remained popular, and not only with children, butalso with adult players, while at the same time being regularly sneered andsniffed at. Grown-up Pokemonaficionados are accused of being caught in nostalgia or afflicted withimmaturity and bad taste in games, and the whole franchise is branded asnothing but a shamelessly commercial pile of crap. But surely, nostalgia,supposed bad taste or weakness to marketing tricks cannot explain alone theenduring popularity of Pokemon, canthey? This is a series that has been around for two decades now and whoseentries manage to garner stellar reviews over and over again, and there areobviously good, solid reasons for that. And upon playing Diamond with an open and curious mind, I can see what these reasonsare, and understand much better why Pokemonis oh so famous. Whathappened is that against all odds, I deeply enjoyed my run of Pokemon Diamond; much more so than Iactually expected. Even with my best critical eye opened, and without thebenefit of nostalgia that makes the heart grow fonder, I found a lot ofundeniable qualities in Diamond. The firstblatant quality of Diamond, andprobably of all Pokemon entries, isits sheer accessibility. The basic rules of the game are incredibly easy tofigure out, and you can dive straight into the action from the get-go: there’sno need to ponder strategies or rack your brain in order to build the perfectlybalanced team before you can venture on the field like in more complex RPGs.Not only that, but the purpose of every single object you encounter in the gameworld is dutifully and exhaustively explained, and that purpose is alwaysclear-cut and one-dimensional: items have no hidden side effects likedecreasing some of your stats, so you can feel safe and free to use themwithout fearing any sort of collateral damage. Every operation related to your‘Mons, like healing them or teaching them new moves, is carefully broken downand laid down before you one step at a time, requiring your approval beforemoving on to the next step; while this may seem a tad too overbearing at times,it also guarantees that you won’t make any mistake and end up doing somethingyou were not planning to do. This is a game that meets you more than halfwayand does everything it can to facilitate your accustomization and assure that you will feel atease while playing. However,while it may take only a couple of minutes to figure out the rules of Diamond and of the Pokemon series as a whole, it may actually take dozens, if nothundreds of hours to master them to the fullest. Despite its apparentsimplicity, Diamond is a game that isextremely deep and packs an incredible amount of content. I played it for 35hours, and yet I can very clearly feel that I only brushed oh so gently thesurface of the game. There is a tremendous amount of content and knowledge thatis still hidden to me, from the subtle layers of strategy involved in Pokemonbattles to the Pokemon themselves, of which I captured only a fraction; andlet’s not even talk about the complex mechanics of breeding and leveling up. Onething is sure though: it’s impossible to blame the series for being shallow andsuperficial. There is a lot to do anda lot to discover, and that is undeniable. I was actually quite flabbergastedby the depth of Diamond—right beforebecoming thrilled by the promises it held. Not that Iactually uncovered and enjoyed all that Diamondpromised; far from it, in fact. My run, on which I will expand further in mynext post, was exactly what I planned it to be: a brief first shot at the Pokemon series, as straightforward and basicas it could be. And I have to say that it worked beautifully—beyond my wildestexpectations, actually, which prompts me to mention what I consider to be themost prominent and glorious quality of the Pokemonseries. And that quality, ladies and gentlemen, is flexibility. Diamond is a game that lets you playexactly the way you want without forcing any agenda on you: despite its heavingfocus on completion, it never actually forces you to frenetically collecthundreds of ‘Mons. I feared that it would indeed do exactly that, which wouldhave basically ruined my fun, along with my run; but my fears were absolutelyunfounded. To my utter delight, I could play Diamond the very exact way I intended to play it, which was totallyat odds with the series’ basic principles, and it worked like a charm. Toinfuse a game with such a high level of adaptability is not an easy feat; it’sso difficult, in fact, that very few games manage to reach that Eldorado ofopenness and offer every gamer the freedom to play their own way. Diamond is one of these precious few,and I’d wager that most Pokemonentries, if not all of them, boast the same delicious flexibility. Diamond smoothly molds itself into thevery game you want it to be: it is really as deep and strategic as you make it,and you’re the one deciding how deep you want to delve. You can stay at thesurface like I did, dive a bit deeper, or go for the abyss and master everysingle subtlety of the battle mechanics, and the game will very likely accommodateyou every time, no matter which path you choose. I am quiteconvinced that this malleability and gentle catering to the player’s desires arethe main reasons behind the enduring popularity of the Pokemon series. This is a game that truly has something to offer toeveryone—providing that they are RPG-inclined to start with, even though Iwouldn’t be surprised if the series could win over some gamers that are notinto the genre. This sheds a new light on the simplicity of the graphics andsoundtrack and reveals a deeper purpose for their nondescript quality: by beingso basic and without asperities, they are likely to appeal to everyone, or atleast be accepted by everyone, which reinforces the openness boasted by theseries. They also give a timeless quality to the games and make the series morelikely to endure and stand the test of time; and it’s working beautifully, ifthe high prices of the older entries are to be believed. But I’m now adamantthat Diamond and the Pokemon series as a whole are indeed high-qualitygames: if I could enjoy Diamond somuch while being anything but a collector and completionist, not being theprimary target and not being under the influence of any kind of nostalgia, thenI’m pretty sure every RPG aficionado can enjoy it. So, I’ve tamedthe beast after all these years, and it was quite the blast. I really loved Pokemon Diamond; so much so, in fact,that I could nearly go for another playthrough right away. But I’m not going todo that; instead, I will purchase other Pokemonentries. I’m definitely set on discovering the full series now, including theolder installments, and that is a thrilling and delighting prospect; there’snothing quite like the late discovery of a huge series bursting with a wholerichness of games to savour. Oh, the joy! I will stop for now; in my next post,I will expand more profusely on my basic yet utterly enjoyable run, with thehope of offering a new insight into Pokemongames and how they can be played. As for now, thanks for reading, and be myguest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Legend of Zelda-Link’s Awakening (2): That legendary plot twist (with massive SPOILERS!)", "date": "27/05/2014", "text": "I wasinitially planning to write a single article about Link’s Awakening; but after I cleared that supposedly unique post,I found myself yearning for more. More development, more depth, more dwellingon that great game; you name it. I thus started a second playthrough and setmyself to write about a specific point that has always been dear to my gamer’sheart, namely Link’s Awakening’sincredibly moving Plot Twist. I only brushed the subject in my last post, andmentioned it briefly in my article about AvalonCode’s own plot twist prior tothat; and I feel that the time is now ripe to delve deeper into the matter. Therewill of course be mountains of spoilers, so if you never played Link’s Awakening and intend to do so, avert your eyes right away—or better yet, go play that great game and see the unfolding of that striking event foryourself before coming back and reading my musings on the matter. As Imentioned before, I’ve seen my fair share of plot twists over the years, and Ican honestly say that Link’s Awakeningplot twist is the one that struck me the most in my entire gaming life. It wasone of these defining gaming moments that are bound to stick into any gamer’smemory for the rest of their life. In fact, the first discovery of that plottwist is embedded so strongly in my memory that I can still remember where Iwas and what time of the day it was when it happened, not to mention myreaction to it. I consider this plot twist to be a true masterpiece, bothstructure-wise and content-wise, and here’s why. Inverse proportionalityLink’s Awakening amazing plot twist is exactly that: a plottwist, in the most literal sense of the word. It’s an entirely unexpected developmentthat strikes as a lightning bolt out of a clear blue sky, taking the playerentirely by surprise and twisting the plot in a drastically different direction.Sure, there are some hints here and there in the game world, if you lookclosely: Koholint Island is littered with owl statues delivering cryptic yetforeboding sentences regarding the nature of the island, and the dream theme isprevalent in the storyline and addressed in various ways: the Wind Fish isasleep, you have to jump in bed to recover the Ocarina, and so on. However,making any deductions about the game world’s nature from these clues would beabsolutely far-fetched; it’s much easier to see them as an overall thematic,especially if the player doesn’t expect a plot twist in the first place. Theeffect of that sudden and unexpected revelation is conveniently devastating, pullingthe rug out from under the player’s feet and drastically altering their visionof the situation. Thisdramatic effect is only reinforced by the very sober way in which in this plottwist is introduced to the player. Less is more, as they say, and it’s neverbeen so true. The presentation couldn’t be more low-key: this vision-alteringevent is basically nothing more than the reading of a couple of sentences on abas-relief, and yet it is powerful enough to shake your vision of the gameworld to the core. I find it similar to the infamous plot twist in The Empire strikes back, in which asimple four-world sentence shatters Luke’s—and the viewer’s—beliefs with fullforce. You don’t hear Link scream in pain and despair as Luke does after thebig revelation, but it’s telling enough that this elicits his only sentence inthe whole game, an incredulous “What? Illusion?”. Anyway, it’s not like youneed any virulent reaction from Link at that point: you are so shocked, hurtand in disbelief after uncovering that plot twist that you really don’t needany kind of reinforcing display of emotion from routinely mute little Link.This low-key presentation cleverly leaves room for your own feelings, givingthem the opportunity to conveniently overwhelm you. A grander, more elaboratedsetting may have diverted your attention from your emotions, diminishing theirimpact on you; better let you as alone as possible with them so that they canproperly flow and sweep over you. Thisdoesn’t mean that no effort was put in the setting or that it was not thoughtfullyand carefully conceived and executed. Low-key it may be, but it’s highlypurposeful in its sobriety, with every single element being designed to enhanceand reinforce your feelings at that time. The most obvious and striking elementis the music: the tune that plays in the Southern Shrine where the plot twisttakes place is undoubtedly the saddest tune of the game. It conveys full-blownsorrow, loneliness and desolation and is bound to exacerbate your own oh sosimilar feelings upon discovering the plot twist. The darkness trick may seeminnocuous and mundane at first, but it is also designed to enhance youremotions. For a quick reminder, you need to light up torches with magic powderin order to be able to read the bas-relief; and as you stay immobile in frontof it, struck and in shock after having uncovered the plot twist, the lightswill die out, leaving you in the darkness again, which will increase your feelingsof sadness, fragility and your dismay over what just happened. It is a simpleyet very powerful trick, and it works beautifully. Even after all these yearsof playing that game, I still exit the room immediately after reading thebas-relief just to avoid finding myself engulfed in that oppressive darkness. Thegame cleverly expands the experience by creating an aftermath to that plottwist, in which your feelings are subtly echoed rather than enhanced. Thesixth dungeon, the Face Shrine, follows immediately after and features amusical theme that perfectly resonates with your feelings at the time. It’s avariation of the Southern Shrine theme that conveys a quieter, somewhat subduedsadness, along with a quiet resignation and a burgeoning resolution to forgeahead. To say that it fits your feelings at this point of the game is a euphemism:never in my gaming life had I seen such a perfect correspondence between myfeelings and a piece of in-game music. It’s pretty obvious that this plot twistis supposed to be a twofold experience from the get-go: the two shrines areexplicitly linked to each other, two pieces of the same structure. The SouthernShrine delivers the blow and the Face Shrine allows you to slowly digest it andassimilate what you just learned. At the end of this twofold trip, you willreemerge from these shrines as a new Link, now fully aware of the nature of theworld around you and of what your quest entails. This plot twist is actuallystructured like a spiritual journey that first summons pain and sorrow,followed by a slow acceptance and crowned by a quiet yet firm resolution; thefact that it takes place in two places referred to as ‘shrines’ or ‘temples’, i.e.places of spirituality, indicates strongly that the developers wanted to haveit come across as such. Crossing the rubiconThe whole ‘Thiswas but a dream all along, ha-ha!’ trope can be regularly encountered invarious forms in movies, the most famous incarnation of it undoubtedly being‘The Matrix’; yet, for some unfathomable reason, it is extremely rare invideogames in general and in the Holy Realm of RPG in particular. And yet, itturns out to be extremely engrossing in that very context thanks to theinteractivity factor. Not only is your vision of the game world turned upsidedown, which is a similar experience to the one you would go through when watchinga movie using this kind of plot twist, but your responsibility as a player isalso engaged. The game entrusts you with the power of controlling the maincharacter, which often then entails the duty to save the world; but in Link’s Awakening, you end up with thepower to erase the game world from existence, which is truly a horrifying andoverwhelming prospect. Yet, interestingly enough, you do have the choice to keep consciously things as they are: justlike Cypher in The Matrix, whodecides to remain in the Matrix while knowing fully well that it is nothingmore than an elaborate dream, you can decide not to wake up the Wind Fish andremain in Koholint instead. You can keep frolicking from one place to the next,play the Rapid Ride mini-game over and over, listen to Marin sing, talk toeveryone under the sun, burn everything in sight with the Magic Rod and exactat last your revenge on those annoying, aggressive Maple dogs by roasting themalive if such is your choice, and nobody can prevent you from doing that. Ofcourse, it may not be the most interesting thing to do as a player, but you canstill very much do it if it pleases you. Still, mostof us will of course want to clear the game by waking up the Wind Fish,especially the first time around. It may be a convenient thing to play the gameand give up just before the very end because you know where all this leads whenyou’re a seasoned Link’s Awakeningplayer; but when this is your first playthrough, you will want to get to thebottom of things, especially since the game keeps taunting you by implyingthat, you know, it may all be a dream, but maybe not after all, who knows? Butthis desire to see things through goes along with strong emotions: sadness,loneliness, and most interestingly, guilt. Upon learning that you have thepower to erase the game world and must use it to get out of the island, you willfeel terribly guilty of having to do so, especially since at that point, youhave likely grown quite attached to Koholint and its inhabitants. I swear thatthe first time I played the game, I had a hard time coming back to MapleVillage knowing what was in store for all these lovely people and knowing that Iwould be the one responsible for that. Heck, even roaming the beautiful Koholintgrasslands to get there in the first place was painful, making my heart acheand my eyes sting as I thought about what fate awaited this lovely island. It’snot so often, if ever, that you bear the overwhelming responsibility ofdestroying the very game world you’re roaming: you usually have to save it, noterase it entirely to save your own skin. Link’sAwakening is quite a unique and bold game in that regard, putting you in adire situation that you will undoubtedly remember for all your gaming life.Interestingly,the situation is more complex than it may seem at first sight. It’s pretty muchobvious that the Wind Fish is dreaming and that you are somehow stuck in theirdream world, but what about your own current state as Link? The game startswith your boat getting struck by a lightning bolt, after which you wake up onthe beach in Koholint Island; but you sure cannot be fully awakened at thatvery moment, right? The game seems to whisper in your ear that you are also dreaming alongside the WindFish; you may think you’re frolicking around in Koholint, but in truth, you arevery likely lying passed out on a wood plank in the middle of the ocean afterthis lightning bolt destroyed your boat. Not only that, but your own dreamlikely mixed with the one of the Wind Fish, who was probably sleeping nearbywhen you fainted from the accident. This explains the presence of Moblins inKoholint, as well as the striking resemblance between Marin and Zelda and thefact that the ever-morphing final Boss takes the form of Ganon and Agahnim;these are elements lifted from Link’s former adventures and brought in thedream world by Link himself, not by the Wind Fish. The very title of the gamealso seems to hint strongly at the fact that you are indeed asleep the whole time,as well as the Wind’s Fish final words to you: “Let us awaken together!”. Therewould be a lot to say about the different possible interpretations of Link’s Awakening plot twist and general storyline,especially the more metaphorical ones, but that would stray too far from thispost’s subject. My job here was to praise the very moving Plot Twist of thatgame, and I feel that the deed is done. By the timeI wrote this post, I also cleared my second playthrough of Link’s Awakening, and I’mnow ready to move on. After this pleasant dwelling on Koholint’s well-known yetstill enticing shores, let the winds of inspiration carry me to new ventures! Asalways, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "The Legend of Zelda-Link´s Awakening (1): The stuff cult classics are made of", "date": "19/05/2014", "text": "I am very much in the mood for retro gamingthese days; and since I needed something really excellent to replenish mygaming mojo after the somewhat mixed experience provided by Sword of Mana, I chose to pick up one of my favourite retro gemever, namely The Legend of Zelda: Link´sAwakening—and to create that brand new \"Oldies Goldies\" category in which I plan to unashamedlypraise my favourite games of yesteryear, starting with this one.TheLegend of Zelda: Link´s Awakening is the fourth entryof the venerable Legend of Zelda seriesand was developed and published by Nintendo in 1993 for the original Gameboy.It is widely recognized as the best game ever released on the system and wasalso the only Zelda installment toever grace it; incidentally, it´s also the only Zelda game I ever played. (I´m planning to change that in the nearfuture: I have a handful of handheld Zeldagames lined up and patiently waiting to be tried.) And play it I did, indeed: Icleared it countless times over the years without ever getting bored of it. When I firstdiscovered it in 1993, my infatuation was so strong that I would routinelyfinish a playthrough and start another one immediately after. Link's Awakening wasrereleased on the Gameboy Color in 1998(jp/na) and 1999(eu); this version featured abrand-new dungeon and a few cosmetic changes—mostly involving colours, as youmay guess. Apart from these fairly superficial alterations, the game was leftuntouched, which was the best thing to do since the original was nothing shortof perfect. I had never played that version until now, but for the sake of thispost and curiosity, I decided to give it a try at last. Let’s start with some clarification: thereis a long-lasting debate about whether the Zeldagames should be classified as Action-RPGs or as Action-Adventure games. Bothsides have valid arguments and a definitive answer on the matter has never beenreached. The Zelda games could eitherbe seen as Action-Adventure games with RPG elements or as Action-RPGs in theirsimplest form, no-frill takes on the genre that remove all unnecessary obstructionsfor the sake of gameplay’s fluidity and smoothness. My stance is that the Zelda series is a perfect hybrid of thetwo aforementioned genres—and I will therefore use both tags in this article’sdescription. It’s been a couple of years since I lastplayed Link’s Awakening, which led tosome interesting results during this playthrough. Nostalgia was still present,of course, but I could also see the game through the filter of experience, andthis gave me a better understanding of how excellent this game actually is. Iwas hard-pressed to find any relevant flaw in it, even with my best criticaleye wide opened; the very minor flaws I saw in it actually date all the wayback to 1993 when I first played it, and I’ll address them later for the sakeof trivia. But for now, let’s dive head first into the very first handheld Zelda entry and expose it in all its8-bit glory.  A marvel of designIf there is one department in which thisgame shines in an outstanding way, it is definitely the level-design. It’stight, precise and crystal-clear, and boasts a near-perfection that many gamescould take lessons from, including recent offerings. To put it simply, ifOckam’s Razor could be applied to game design, the result would be Link’s Awakening. Every single area inthe game serves a purpose in the grand scheme of things and the way they arearranged is simply brilliant. Everything flows naturally and the next step inyour progression always falls smoothly into place; and yet, the game manages toavoid evincing any linearity by constantly giving you various tasks to completeand sending you all around the world map, all the while giving you a certainamount of leeway regarding the order in which you have to complete these tasks.On top of that, Link’s Awakening doesa really good job at taunting you with unreachable places that progressivelyopen up as you progress. I remember standing next to some then unmovable rocksthe very first time I played the game and wondering what could linger beyond:the curiosity was almost unbearable, and the satisfaction of finally reachingthose fantasized areas latter in the game was priceless. To offer a parsimonious,purposeful and efficient level design while maintaining a strong focus onexploration and discovery is not an easy task, and this game is one of theglorious few that nail it perfectly. Another thing that struck me deeply is howuser-friendly Link’s Awakening is. Ididn’t really pay attention to this point back in the days: I was simplyenjoying it and not thinking twice about it. But with hindsight and the weightof my experience as an RPG veteran, I can now see that this game is decidedlydevoted to making the player’s life easier. This is especially obvious indungeons and presents itself as such: if you ever need a specific item to clearyour way and go forward in a dungeon, it will be available somewhere in thisvery dungeon. I’m not talking about the specific treasure that you find inevery single dungeon and that will lead you further in the game world—like theHook, the Flippers and so on—but rather about the more menial items that youuse on a regular basis for all purposes, namely bombs, arrows and the magicpowder. If you need any of these three to go forward in a dungeon, you willfind it in that very dungeon, hidden under a pot or hovering in the air andwaiting to be picked. Link’s Awakeningwill never force you to exit the dungeon and go all the way back to town torefurbish; should you run out of the very item you need, it will be at hand,waiting patiently for you. This is a wonderful quality of that game and onethat is rare enough to be praised and enjoyed to the fullest. Better not equate this user-friendlyquality with easiness, though; for Link’sAwakening may be accommodating, but it’s by no means pampering. This is ademanding game that challenges you relentlessly from beginning to end bysubmitting you to this oh so classic staple of the Zelda series: the DungeonPuzzles, ladies and gentlemen. They come in all shapes and sizes and involveall sorts of objects and thought processes, from pushing blocks to open doorsto bombing walls to uncover secret rooms and many more. The difficulty curverises slowly but steadily, leading you from gentle and clue-laden riddles tovicious, mind-bending puzzles that will test your wits and patience. (Thedifficulty of the last two dungeons in that regard is legendary.) However,despite their growing difficulty and overall complexity, these puzzles alwaysremain fair and logical. There is always a way to figure out what must bedone:  whether it be a written cluesomewhere in the dungeon, a specific marking on the ground or a special itemright at hand, something will always be there to orientate your thinking andaction in the right direction. On top of that, the logics at work remain thesame throughout the whole game, which allows you to reuse successfully whatyou’ve learnt, and any new puzzle is always accompanied by a helpful clue tohelp you figure out which logic is at work behind it. Nothing is far-fetched orillogical and the game pushes you to make clever use of your items; everysingle one of them will come in handy at one point or another, which is notonly the mark of an excellent overall design, but is also deeply satisfying andrewarding. Ownerof a lonely heartLink’sAwakening is not only a game so polished you cansee your reflection in it; it is also a very unique and original offering inthe Zelda series. This is the first Zelda entry that features none of thefamiliar characters and settings of the series: there is no Hyrule to roam, noPrincess Zelda to save, no Triforce to recover and no Ganon to crush. Instead,you’re introduced to a brand new land, the Koholint Island, along with apuzzling objective: to wake up a creature called the Wind Fish that currentlysleeps deeply nested in an egg on top of the island’s highest peak. There is nodefinite main enemy to defeat, the game referring instead episodically to themounting power of the resident monsters and the devastating influence theycould have on Koholint if they were left unchecked. You then find yourselfembroiled in a quest that is a puzzling mix between trying to escape from theisland and trying to save it from the monsters, two objectives that can beachieved only by waking up the aforementioned Wind Fish. This is a radicaldeparture from the series’ template, and one that works fairly well. It seemsthat Miyamoto and his team wanted to stray from the established path and offersomething new, using the Gameboy’s special status as a handheld to experimentsomething truly different. Interestingly, Link’sAwakening was initially supposed to be a simple port of A Link to the Past, the famous installmentreleased in 1991 on the SNES, before the gaming muse wriggled its way into thedevelopment process and decided otherwise; and as good as A Link to the Past may be (I still have to discover that), abrand-new game is undoubtedly a much better deal, especially one as original asLink’s Awakening. Link’sAwakening is also quite unique in the widerAction-RPG/Action-Adventure landscape. This uniqueness boils down to its mainovertone, which is one you don’t encounter so often in RPGs: Loneliness. Notthe thrilling, inspiring loneliness of the lone ranger adventuring bravely onuncharted and perilous roads to save the world, but rather the forlorn lonelinessof the outcast, stranded in a land they don’t belong to. The game calls you‘Casteway’ at some point, and that pretty much sums up the situation andencompasses the undercurrent of loneliness and isolation that runs throughoutthe whole game. You interact with the locals on a regular basis, but there isalways a very obvious distance between you and them that never gets bridgedduring the game. The fact that Koholint is an island and that your very goal isto leave it for good creates that distance in the first place, and the locals’attitude towards you reinforces it: they never truly treat you as a part oftheir world and don’t really seem to care about your presence at all. EvenMarine, who is seemingly fond of you, takes for granted that you will soon behistory and speaks accordingly. The absence of any inn or house where you canfall back and rest further increases your status as a foreign entity: you haveliterally no place in that world, and the only thing you can do is roam itwithout respite until your quest is over. I remember feeling that lonelinessvery deeply when I played the game in 1993, without being able to pinpoint theexact reason for it; I am now able to do so, and I marvel all the more at howmasterfully the game manages to distil that sense of loneliness and isolation andinstil it slowly but surely into the player’s mind. Then, there is of course that legendary Plot Twist. I won’t spoil anything there for the sake of those who haven’tplayed the game, but suffice it to say that it is quite unique and isdefinitely an event of huge magnitude in your adventure. This is also a pointof no-return: there is a before and an after, and things will never be the sameafter you cross that Rubicon. This plot twist leaves you more isolated andalienated than ever, and paves the way to an ending that is truly bittersweet.Once again, this is a huge departure from the Zelda template, given that the first three games were more upbeatand ended up on a very positive note. It was quite a bold move to change themood so radically for this episode and it must be praised and appreciated assuch.  Pastand presentAll in all, I’ve been playing Link’s Awakening for more than twodecades now, and that creates a very interesting standpoint: nostalgia andexperience blend to give birth to a view that is fuelled by a deep knowledge ofthe source material and an undying love for it along with the keen eye andsharp analysis skills of the veteran. And from that standpoint, I can affirmthat Link’s Awakening is a game thatstands the test of time amazingly well. The clear-cut graphics, with theirroundedness and smoothness, have a timeless quality, and the mechanics are sowell honed that they simply cannot rust, no matter how many years pass. Notonly is Link’s Awakening stillperfectly worth playing today, but it could give lessons in brilliancy to manycurrent games on a handful of matters, from clever level design to top-notchphysics. All this praise doesn’t mean that I turn ablind eye to the game’s flaws; I wrote earlier that I would address them, and I’mgoing do so now. Even back in the days, some points rubbed me the wrong way,the most blatant one being the inordinate amount of time you have to spend inyour inventory juggling between items. This was of course dictated by the verylimited number of buttons available on the Gameboy, and Miyamoto and his team reallymade a good job of making this process as fast and simple as possible; however,you still have to put up with it, and it can grow tiresome at times. I alwaysthought that the level design on the world map was slightly uneven: somemarginally useful areas are allotted a huge amount of space, while key areas arerestricted to very narrow spaces that nearly make you feel claustrophobic. Forinstance, I always resented that the completely optional Rapid Ride occupiedsuch a huge portion of the map while the story-relevant Yarna Desert wasconfined to a tiny corner of it. The pacing also is uneven: the very last arcof the adventure, containing the last two of the eight regular dungeons as wellas the final one where the Wind Fish sleeps, feels strangely rushed andshallow compared to everything that unfolded before. It certainly doesn’t helpthat these three dungeons are located on a very narrow area of the map thatgives you the feeling that you’re both constrained and teetering on edges anddrastically shrinks your horizons, both visually and mentally. The final dungeon in particular is shockingly short and follows immediately after theeighth regular dungeon, which is disappointing: I would have liked a morecomplex take on that final challenge, as well as an extra bit of adventuringbefore heading there. In relation to that, I’ve always been deeply frustratedby the fact that you get the Magic Rod extremely late in the game, namely inthe eighth regular dungeon, and thus cannot enjoy it as much as you’d like to. However,none of these flaws are deal-breakers. They are present and can be frustratingat times, but they can’t spoil the brilliancy of that sparkling gem that is Link’s Awakening.    I will conclude that post with a‘Favourites’ section entirely fuelled by the power of nostalgia. I’d love tohear about your personal ‘Favourites’ in Link’sAwakening, so feel free to expand on them in the comments!—Favourite Music: the whole soundtrack ofthat game is a feast to the ears, but the Face Shrine theme is my absolute favourite.  Reminding strongly of a Bach prelude, it is athoughtful, reflective piece of music evoking sadness, resignation andresolution all at once. It also has the rare quality of being one of the onlythemes in Link’s Awakening thatperfectly echoes your feelings at that precise point in the game, which makesit all the more striking and memorable. It’s followed closely by the Tal Tal Heightstheme, the bouncy, adventurous piece that plays in the eponymous area and thatevery Link’s Awakening player wishthey could hear much more often throughout the game. —Favourite Dungeon(s): once again, all theDungeons are enjoyable in their own way; but the Sixth dungeon, the FaceShrine, is my favourite, thanks to its combination of inspired level design andbeautiful music. I also have a strong liking for the third one, the Key Cavern,for its clear-cut and flowing level design, and for the eighth, Turtle Rock,for its thrilling boss run that lets you fight a number of bosses from previousdungeons. —Favourite weapon(s): I love the Hook andthe Ultimate Sword, as well as the Bow&Arrows; yet, like many Link’s Awakening aficionados, myultimate favourite is without a doubt the Magic Rod and its unstoppablefireballs. Too bad it comes so late in the game, hardly leaving you the timeand opportunity to enjoy its power. —Favourite Moment: the South Shrine visit.This is an intensely sad and heart-breaking moment, but this is also by far themost memorable, which is why I love it so much. I still get shivers down myspine when I read that bas-relief—which I do in every single playthrough,despite knowing fully well what’s engraved on it. So, here ends my praise of Link’s Awakening.  If you’ve not played that game yet, Iwholeheartedly encourage you to do so, for it is truly a cult classic. Thanksfor reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Sword of Mana: Disappointing on both counts (3)", "date": "14/05/2014", "text": "Here comes my third and last post about Sword of Mana, in which I will give myfinal thoughts on the matter and then rest my case for good. Here we go!I’ve expanded profusely about how Sword of Mana was the gaming equivalentof a half-hearted donkey stuck between a bucket of water and a stack of hay,and that ranting of sorts may have given the impression that I absolutely hatedit; however, and funnily enough, that is not the case. Sword of Mana is an unpolishedgame that doesn’t know where it stands and what it wants to achieve, that muchis undeniable, but it’s not a horrible game by any means. I actually liked it,and did so enough to clear two playthroughs in a row. I definitely had goodmoments playing it, and even if it was an underwhelming experience as a whole,I will probably come back to it in the distant future. In all fairness, Sword of Mana does have redeeming qualities. They are not prevalentenough to erase the flaws I’ve mentioned earlier and make that game amasterpiece, but they are present nonetheless and make Sword worth playing to some extent. I have to be fair and mentionthem, starting with the most obvious one: the gorgeous graphics. Sword is undoubtedly one of the mostbeautiful games on the GBA, treating the player’s retina with lush and colourfuldecors, landscapes and vistas. Colours are vibrant and shiny and rendered in atruly beautiful style that’s halfway between colour pencil art and watercolourpainting. They skilfully alternate between delicate pastel nuances and clashingvivid hues depending on the context and manage to create a mesmerizingatmosphere. Next in line, and encompassing the former, is the splendid artdirection. It’s immediately recognizable and distinctive, with excellentcharacter models that stray from the usual cookie-cutter anime style thatplagues too many JRPGs, gorgeous outdoors that beg to be roamed endlessly and lovelytown designs that make you want to linger there forever. The graphics’ intricacyand precision are stunning, especially compared to your average GBA game: thewhole game world bristles with elaborate details, and the textures areincredibly well-rendered. Whether it be the rugged surface of a rock, the softfabric of a carpet, the polished gleam of metal or the smooth patina ofcenturies-old cobblestones, everything is vibrant and lively, all the whileremaining beautifully stylized and highly evocative.As a whole, it’s fair to say that Sword of Mana completely nails that veryspecific Seiken atmosphere thataficionados of the series have come to know and love. This is a Seiken game at heart, and it takes but aglimpse to confirm that; stare longer, and you’ll be swept away by thatinimitable Mana charm and carriedinto a place of true beauty. Basking in that unique atmosphere is an absolutepleasure, and one that I certainly indulged into during my playthroughs. In light of that distinctive Mana atmosphere, I can see very wellwhat Square Enix and Brownie Brown may have tried to achieve here, and evencondone it. The Seiken series didn’tstart the way we know it today: FinalFantasy Adventure/Mystic Questwas initially nothing more than a FinalFantasy spin-off with a strong action-adventure flavour. It’s beenrightfully described as a mix of FinalFantasy and Zelda, featuring theepic grandeur of the first—along with Chocobos—and the dungeon puzzles of thesecond. It’s only with its second entry, the immensely popular Secret of Mana, that the Seikenseries declared independence from its venerable parent and became its ownfranchise with highly distinctive qualities. The original, however, remainedwhat it was, a slightly stinging reminder that Seiken was indeed notalways its own series. Ten years passed and three games were released, each oneexpanding on the Mana mythology anddeepening the specificities of the series, and it seemed that Seiken was on good rails and promised tolast. What better idea, then, than to give a good lifting to that somewhatmismatched first episode of the series and make it more cohesive with thesubsequent installments? It would also be a fantastic opportunity to introducethe Mana lore to a new generation ofplayers on the then brand-new Game Boy Advance. This was a great idea, and it seemed that Square Enix was really seriousand committed about it, to the point of bringing Brownie Brown and its wealthof former Squaresoft employees into the picture, and a dazzling gem of a game couldhave been expected from that match seemingly made in heaven. However, as we’veseen before, things didn’t turn out so well. It’s really quite a pity and ashame, for Sword of Mana could havebeen one of the greatest RPGs on the GBA and another immaculate entry in the Seiken series instead of the marginallygood game it turned out to be.Worse, Swordof Mana also started for good what I would call the ‘Mana Decline Discourse’. Ithad been simmering prior to that with the release of Legend of Mana on the Playstation: many players were perplexed anddisconcerted by the open structure of that game, which offered a swarm ofsidequests and a huge variety of objectives in lieu of the usual main questwith a rock-solid narrative. This was a departure from the series’ template,and one that didn’t please all; many players and critics resented it, allthe while hoping that this was only a misstep and that the next game would be areturn to form. But then came Sword ofMana and its lack of greatness, and it cemented the perception that the Seiken series, after having culminatedin Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, was now sadly goingdownhill. The responsibility of Swordin the expansion of the Mana declinediscourse is enormous: had it been a great game on par with the 16-bit eraentries, the notion that the Seikenseries was waning would have been buried before it was fully born, with Legend of Mana being considered a simple mistake—and very likely, as timewent on, as an underrated experiment worth rediscovering. Instead of that, Sword single-handedly embedded thenotion of the series’ decline in the minds of critics and players, and itpersisted to that day, since Square Enix didn’t bother to dispel it byreleasing a great Seiken entry that couldhave become a cult classic. The time has come to rest my case for good,folks. And here’s my verdict: despite the fact that I’m a die-hard Seiken aficionado and that I enjoyed itto some extent, I really can’t ardently recommend Sword of Mana to anyone,for this game is too unpolished and unfulfilling to deserve such a thing as a enthusiastic recommendation. Still, that doesn’t mean that it’s totallyunworthy and shouldn’t be played at all costs, for there is still some good init. My final words on the matter will thus be these: if you want to play thatgame, be prepared. Know what to expect and what you’re stepping into, and youmay avoid the disappointment that plagued me. And also: heck, I’m reallycurious about Final Fantasy Adventurenow. Gee, let’s add it to my Must-Play list of retro games! And as always,thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Sword of Mana: Disappointing on both counts (2)", "date": "10/05/2014", "text": "So, here we are again, for the second partof my rant about Sword of Mana. In mylast article, I’ve explained why I felt strongly that this game failed as aremake, so it’s now time to move on to the next step and examine things under adifferent light. For at this point, it’s seriously possible to wonder if Sword of Mana was indeed intended as aremake. Maybe this is not the right angle to consider it, and maybe this gameshould be envisioned as a brand-new entry in the series rather than a remake.However, that doesn’t solve the issue at all; it only moves it to a differentterrain. If this game was indeed supposed to be a fresh installment, then itfails miserably at it all the same, and here’s why. Failingas a brand new Seiken game:Luxuriating in lazinessOnce again, things don’t exactly startwell: there is an blatant and unmissable sign that if Sword of Mana is indeed supposed to be a shiny new game, then it’snot going to do a very good job at it. This sign lies in the very concept ofripping off the storyline of an older game to reuse it as the base for a newgame, which is an idea that oozes absolute and unashamed laziness through everypore. Furthermore, there is also the small issue of the copy-pasting of allthese features from older Seikenentries, which is also a tiny weeny bit lazy. I won’t expand further on thesepoints in that second part, for I already gave them a run for their money inthe first one.Instead, I will expand on the fact that if Sword of Mana also fails as a brand-newgame, it’s mostly because it regresses on all counts compared to the SNESepisodes. This is quite ironic considering the whole‘stealing-from-former-installments’ pattern of this game; but stealing afeature and implementing it well are two very different things, and nowhere isthis more painfully obvious than in Swordof Mana.First to get a grilling is the fightingsystem. An Action-RPG lives and dies by its fighting system, and mostspecifically by the physics of the said fighting system. And in Sword, the physics are mediocre atbest. They are not broken, granted, butthey remain deeply unsatisfying. The enemies’ hitbox is wobbly and tends tovary from one foe to the next, and sometimes from one blow to the next; as aresult, you can never be completely sure that you will land a hit, which isdeeply frustrating. Worse, your own hitbox behaves in the same erratic way,which can lead you to take damage when you least expect it; and since there isno way to block attacks, you have no choice but to run away and try toreposition yourself. There is supposedly a 3-hit combo that can deal moredamage, but it’s incredibly hard to pull off and fails more often than not. The magic doesn’t fare better, sadly. Casting spells is a clunky and impreciseprocess that takes way too much time for its own good—and for your own, enpassant. To add insult to injury, someone came up with the brilliant idea ofassigning a limited range to spells, making them virtually identical toweapons—only less efficient, since it takes longer to cast them. Maybe therange actually increases as you level up your magic, but since I didn’t botherto do so, I have no idea about it. I suppose one could blame me for not havingpushed the system to its fullest potential, but here’s the point: this systemsimply doesn’t make me want to use it at all, which I consider a failure per se. A good Action-RPG fightingsystem is immediately compelling and intoxicating and makes you want to comeback for more and deepen your mastery of it; if it fails to do so, then it’sjust not a good system, period. Granted, the use of magic in Action-RPGs isoften a tricky business with mixed results; but Secret of Mana and Seiken 3,of all games, had a perfect magic system that was simple to grasp, pleasant touse and, last but not least, incredibly efficient. Since nearly everything in Sword comes from former Seiken entries, why not import this as well,instead of coming with a clumsy new system? As a whole, the physics are quite difficult to graspand it takes a ridiculously long time to do so; and even after it’s done, theystill remain largely unfulfilling. Second in line to get a serious roasting isthe abysmal implementation of your ally—or allies, as you actually travel witha second character that regularly switches with others; once again, a good ideaon paper and a miserable failure in-game. The AI in Sword is simply the worst I’ve ever seen in any Action-RPG, Seiken-related or else. I’m already nottoo fond of having to put up with allies in my Action-RPG; given that they areoften implemented in a deplorable way, they end up feeling more like giantboulders than helpers, and turn your epic lonely adventure into a tediousescort mission. But this game raises the inefficiency bar to a whole new leveland cranks the irritation meter all the way up to eleven. Not only do theresident allies ruin my pleasure of roaming the world alone as a braveadventurer, but they are also absolutely, completely, totally useless. Theycan’t position themselves properly in order to fight, and even when facingenemies, they either don’t attack or attack in the wrong direction. They don’t runaway from attacks either, preferring to stand there stupidly and get killedinstead; I swear that my ally of the moment often got killed a mere secondsafter I entered a screen. Of course, they won’t heal you either; in fact, theywon’t do anything truly useful—except if you count standing in your way andhindering your attacks as useful. Better not talk about the pathfinding, whichis just pathetic: if you think Secret ofMana was bad in that regard, you’ve seen nothing, for Sword is a million times worse. I swear that this boulder of anally that you have to bear at all times is like a giant blister on the sole ofthat game, stinging you every step of the way. And once again, it’s an absoluteregression, given that Seiken 3 hadreached near perfection regarding the implementation of allies. They were areal help, their pathfinding was spot-on, and as a whole, it was a pleasure tohave them around—even for a loner like me. Square had nailed the perfect AIsettings a full decade before Swordwas even in the making, so why not carry them over to that game? I can’t seeany reason for it except for sheer laziness, really. I still have a bit of grilling to inflictto miscellaneous points that scream laziness and further strengthen the failureof that game as a shiny new Seikeninstallment. Lo and behold, here’s the accursed list:—The boss battles are an absolute joke.They seldom last longer than a minute or two, and it’s usually a matter of acouple of hits before the boss dies. Compared to the boss battles in Secret of Mana and Seiken 3 thatcould last ten to fifteen minutes at most and were an intense and incrediblyrewarding test of endurance, this is just pitiful. —The world map is unclear: you can neversee yourself on it nor have a precise overview of it, so getting a good notionof where places are located is quite a struggle. Not only that, but travellingbetween towns is highly unpractical. Flammie is not present in that game tocarry you around in a beat of her wing, leaving you with the sole options ofwalking or using canons to travel. This is very impractical and definitelydoesn’t encourage backtracking in order to fulfill the numerous sidequests. —The soundtrack was hardly remixed andsometimes sounds like it’s been pulled straight from a NES game. I know the GBAdoesn’t have the best sound chip under the gaming sun, but I’m sure it waspossible to do better that this. Not to mention the fact that it doesn’t reallymake sense to have music pulled straight from an older game in a supposedlybrand-new entry, now does it? But hey, let’s stop with the rhetorical questions.It’s pretty clear by now that Swordis not a satisfying brand-new entry, and this point only further confirms it.—The female and male paths are too similarto each other. Having two different playthroughs was a really neat concept thatcould have turned out into something truly brilliant; instead, laziness tookover once again, turning this good idea into a missed opportunity. Thedifferences between the two playthroughs revolve mainly around narrativeelements and character interactions, while it would have been much moreinteresting to explore entirely exclusive dungeons in each one. Granted, themale path offers a couple of dungeons that are absent from the female path, butthis is simply not meaty enough. Square Enix and Brownie Brown didn’t carrythis interesting concept the whole way, and that’s really a pity. Once again, I’ve made my point: Sword of Mana is not satisfying as abrand-new Seiken entry. On top ofresorting shamelessly to recycling elements from its predecessors, it fails tooffer a polished and smooth gameplay experience. It’s shockingly sketchy insome departments and gives off an overall feeling of incompletion. Compared tothe previous entries, it is most definitely a regression, and this cannot beexplained solely by the fact that this game was released on a handheld console.The GBA library contains tons of games with clear-cut, precise and polishedgameplay—heck, the original Gameboy itself has dozens of them—so hardwarelimitations are not to blame here. Blame rather Square Enix, Brownie Brown andtheir lack of commitment to that game. Once again, I will stop here for the timebeing. In my third and last article, I will wrap things up for good and rest mycase about Sword of Mana. As for now,thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Sword of Mana: Disappointing on both counts (1)", "date": "07/05/2014", "text": "I am anaction-RPG veteran, and the SeikenDensetsu series, better known in the West as the Mana series, is one of my favourites when it comes to real-timefoe-slashing action. However, like many self-professed Seiken aficionados, my knowledge of the series centers mainly onthe two 16-bit era installments released for the SNES. I actually missed most ofthe Seiken games, including Sword of Mana on the Gameboy Advance; Iwas thus really thrilled to get the opportunity to play it a good decade afterits original release, and I expected quite a lot from it. Sword of Mana, released in 2003(jp/na) and 2004(eu) for theGBA, had quite an interesting development process. It was originally designedas a remake of the little-known first game of the Seiken series, known as FinalFantasy Adventure in North-America and MysticQuest in Europe and released for the Gameboy, respectively in 1991 and1993. The development of Sword of Manawas handled by Square Enix along with Brownie Brown, an independent studio packedwith former Squaresoft employees—including some who had previously worked on Final Fantasy Adventure/Mystic Quest. The expertise of thepeople who created the original, along with all the experience accumulated bySquare in ten years of crafting Seikengames; what could possibly go wrong with that picture? Well, quite a lot,unfortunately. As thispost’s title implies, my main gripe with Swordof Mana is that it fails on both fronts. This is a game that doesn’t knowif it wants to be a glorious remake or a shiny new entry, and it showspainfully. It seems that Square Enix and Brownie Brown couldn’t decide on aclear-cut orientation for that gameand make a satisfying choice between creating a full-blown remake or abrand-new game; as a result, Sword ofMana turned out to be an uneven, gravelly and ultimately unfulfilling mixof both. Failing as a remake: Betraying the spirit Ironically,the very first sign that Sword of Manais going to fail as a remake is blatant and unmissable, for it is embedded inits very title. Instead of reusing the name of the original, Square Enix andBrownie Brown went out of their way to create a different title more in tunewith the rest of the series, both in Japanese and English. This is a betrayalof the original game, and a betrayal of the very essence of remaking. A remakeis supposed to be an enhanced, glorified version of a game that respects thespirit of its source material while using the latest advances in technology tosublimate it. To use a different name is a very bad start and may lead one tofear that the spirit and essence of the original will be further spoiled andtainted in the game. And that fear would be very well-founded indeed, o yesprecious. Let’s first tackle the story and characters. They are the same as in the originalgame, which is what you would rightfully expect from a remake. Still, thedevelopers felt compelled to flesh out the story and introduce a measure ofcharacter development, which is also quite common in remakes. In order toexpand the storyline and make it cohesive with the mythology introduced bylatter Seiken entries, therelationships between the characters were reworked and new faces wereintroduced—or reintroduced, like Isabella from Seiken Densetsu 3—along with a decent amount of extra dialogue andcutscenes. New storyline elements were added as well and the narrative was split between the respective pathsof the two playable characters; as a result, you will need to clear bothplaythroughs if you want to contemplate the full picture story-wise. This all lookedreally good on paper and could have turned out quite well, but the actual in-gameresults are absolutely miserable. The clear-cut story of the original game isbastardized and ends up being unnecessarily convoluted, to the point ofactually being nearly incomprehensible. It doesn’t help that the charactersconstantly refer to past events or supposedly famous NPCs like this is allcommon knowledge, not bothering to explain anything to the poor player who justpopped up unaware in their world. The newly created relationships between thecharacters feel unnatural and forced—most likely because they are exactlythat—and the pacing of the game is stilted and uneven. This is not a flowing,seamless game experience—far from it: in fact, it’s nearly possible to pinpointthe additions to the original storyline, so off-balanced and laborious do theyfeel. There is one particular point that really rubs me the wrong way, even though it's but a detail: they introduced the reincarnation theme, which was totally absent from the original. Not only is it cliché to the point of outrage, but it actually adds nothing to the story, which makes it even more infuriating. Does Square Enix have a secret rule dictating that every one of their RPGs must feature a reincarnated character? I would believe it, given the overabundance of that trope in their productions. And frankly, it's getting old. And boring. But thedisfigurement of the venerable first game of the series doesn’t end here; it goesfurther and deeper with the inclusion of gameplay elements lifted directly fromlatter entries. Now, once again, this is something quite common in remakes, andis not bad per se; but in the case ofSword of Mana, it definitely turnedsour. The main issue here is that those gameplay elements have not been wovensmoothly and seamlessly into the fabric provided by the original; instead ofbeing integrated into the game in a lively, organic way that would enrich andnurture the gameplay, they’ve been basically copied and pasted there, creating ajarring patchwork of clashing elements. Take thenight-and-day cycle, which was imported from Seiken Densetsu 3 on the SNES. It was justified in that game bystoryline elements and by the presence of a specific character that wouldtransform at night, and was smoothly implemented in real-time. In Sword of Mana, the presence of that cycleis not justified by anything special, and feels more like a new feature addedjust for the sake of it; not only that, but it’s implemented in a really clumsyway, with few visible changes from day to night and no real-time progression.Instead, the moment of the day changes when you go from one screen to the next,which is just nonsensical. All in all, the copy-paste of this feature was justplain unnecessary: far from bringing anything interesting to the fold, it onlyputs an ugly blemish on the face of the original. Let’s alsotalk about the forging system, which was lifted straight from Legend of Mana on the Playstation; it’sa wonderfully whimsical mix of gardening and forging that involves growing fruitsand vegetables and pairing them with randomly found raw materials to power upyour gear. This system is actually twofold: you can either reforge your weaponsand armors by using raw materials only in order to increase their stats, whichis the simplest option, or modify them by using raw materials coupled withfruits and vegetables in order to modify their properties. This is the mostcomplex option, as it involves growing the fruits and vegetables beforehand bysowing seeds that you find randomly through the game world. Once again, thesystem is not bad per se; it’sactually quite efficient and pleasant to use once you get the hang of it—andget past the ludicrousness of having to mix forging materials with groceries toupgrade your stuff. The problem is that once again, it’s been blatantly copiedand pasted without considering whether it would fit into the canvas provided bythe original. And unfortunately, it does not fit well. For all the fluff addedto the narrative, Sword of Manaremains a very short and linear RPG, just like its venerable model, and thisforging system is simply too complex for such a game. It requires some farmingand a lot of experimenting and tinkering, and the pay-off is simply not yummyenough compared to the amount of time you have to invest in that process. Ionly used the reforging option a couple of times and didn’t bother with thewhole gardening thing, and yet I breezed through the game. So once again, itfeels more like a caked layer of garish make-up plastered all over the face ofthe original than like a smooth and masterful relooking. And once again, ittotally betrays the spirit of the remaking process by not being faithful to theessence of the original game, which was anything but a farming and forgingfest. If there issomething else that the original was not, it’s definitely a sidequest fest,which Sword of Mana is to a fault. Thisis another element imported from Legendof Mana, whose structure was built around the fulfillment of numeroussidequests of various sorts. Once again, there is nothing wrong with sidequestsper se; I actually love them, andusually go out of my way to fulfill them when I play RPGs. However, just likewith the forging system, the implementation of these sidequests was donewithout considering if they would fit into the canvas provided by the original;and just like with the forging system, this is not the case, and for the sameexact reason. Given the linearity and shortness of Sword, the sidequests could not be integrated seamlessly into thenarrative and feel rather like they’ve been thrown haphazardly into the mix.They are totally disjointed from the main story and don’t add anything to itnor expand on it, which is quite a pity. They force you to backtrack quite alot, which may have been an attempt to expand the player’s horizons and letthem make the game world their own; however, it doesn’t work that well and thisforced travelling feels more like a chore than a joy. To add insult to injury,these sidequests won’t give you with anything truly valuable or worthpossessing in return: more often than not, you’ll get only a monetary rewardfor your efforts, which you could have easily reaped faster by slaughtering afew enemies. All in all, they’re not a valuable enhancement that sublimates theoriginal, but rather another ill-advised addition that further bastardizes it.So, I've made my point: Sword of Mana pitifully fails as a remake. It fails to enhance and sublimate its model, choosing instead to disfigure it Frankenstein-style. Could it fare any better as a brand-new Seiken entry? Well, I won't answer that right now. I was initiallyplanning to write only one article about Swordof Mana, but the amount of things I want to say about that game went beyondmy wildest expectations, and my article became a mammoth of an essay. For the sakeof clarity and comfortable reading, I will thus stop here for now. I'll comeback very soon with the rest of my rant, in which I will expand on how Sword of Mana also fails as a brand new game, and then rest my case and give my final thoughts on the matter. As for now, thanks for reading, and be my guestanytime!"},
{"title": "The Room: Myst in a nutshell", "date": "27/04/2014", "text": "I wrotebefore that Point-and-Click games were my second favourite gaming genre everand that I gladly welcomed them in any shape or form. So when I heard about The Room, I knew right away that I hadto try it. Which I did—to my great delight, shall I say. The Room, developed by Fireproof Games and published in2012 for iOS and 2013 for Android, is a game that differs wildly from what youcan usually find on these two platforms. Android and iOS games routinely tendto be casual affairs that involve simple gameplay mechanics, which The Room is anything but; this gameappears as a refreshing island of brain-mashing in an ocean of uninvolvingcasualness.The bestway to describe that game goes as such: it’s basically a pint-sized version of Myst, in which you explore boxes insteadof worlds and tinker with tiny devices instead of huge machineries. Apart fromthis scale difference, it follows the Mysttemplate to a T by featuring first-person view, beautiful and sleek graphicsand an atmospheric soundtrack that sets up a contemplative mood withouthindering the player’s thinking process. It goes without saying that you can’tdie in any way, which makes The Rooma very relaxing experience at its core—albeit an intellectually intense one. As one mayexpect from a Myst-like game, thestory is conveniently vague and laden with mystery. It treats you withappetizing clues about what lurks beyond the borders of your current knowledge,providing thus a great incentive to keep playing. Not that you’ll really needit, if you’re a Point-and-Click aficionado: the enigmas alone are enough tokeep you hooked to the point of obsession. They are clever, stimulating andcome in a variety that’s quite impressive, considering that you’re only dealingwith boxes of various shapes during the whole game. As thetitle indicates, the whole action takes place in a single room. That roomcontains a cabinet that itself holds several secret-laden boxes, contained inone another like Russian dolls. You have to investigate each one of these devicesto uncover hidden mechanisms and secrets that will allow you to progress to thenext step and further uncover the underlying mystery that brought you here inthe first place. This is a manner of speaking, for let’s be honest: you won’tuncover that much in this first installment. Fireproof Games planned to releaseseveral games from the get-go and thus kept the biggest chunk of the mysteryfor the latter episodes, and who could blame them? But back to The Room, 1st. Once again, itfaithfully follows the Myst templateregarding the unfolding of the story and the puzzle solving: you start in thatunknown room with only the most basic information about why you’re here andwhat you’re supposed to do, and you have to figure out how to solve the puzzlesand progress all by yourself. No instructions, no in-game clues woven into thenarrative: you have to tinker, experiment, and most importantly, think—very often out of the box, bothfiguratively and literally. It’s worthnoting that despite taking its cue from Myst,The Room is significantly easier thanany Myst installment ever released. Theenigmas are nowhere near as complex as the ones featured in the Myst series, and the mechanisms involvedare much simpler and easier to crack; and should you still be stuck, the game providesyou with some complimentary clues that can reorient your thinking process inthe right direction. As a Point-and-Click purist, I am slightly offended bythis; but I guess it’s a better option than aiming straight for an FAQ as soonas you’re stuck. And of course, nobody forces me to use these clues in thefirst place, so it’s fine.I’vereferenced Myst quite a lot until now,and that may lead you to wonder if TheRoom is nothing more than a less ambitious, watered-down version of thatmythical Point-and-Click. Well, rest assured: there is fortunately more to The Room than just a copy-paste of Myst. The atmosphere, for one thing, isvery distinct: The Room features adarker, more ominous setting, with supernatural undertones quite reminiscent ofLovecraft’s short stories. The fact that you deal with small contraptions whilebeing confined to a single room gives a claustrophobic feeling to the wholeexperience, which is completely at odds with the openness of the Myst series that sends you out toexplore worlds.   However, ifthere is one single department in which TheRoom outshines and betters Myst athousand times, it has to be the gameplay—or rather, the perfect matching of thegameplay and the hardware. Touchscreen devices are absolutely tailor-made forPoint-and-Click games: no hardware ever can provide a smoother, more satisfyingPoint-and-Click gameplay than a device that lets you poke and probe everycorner of the screen with unmatched precision. And this is exactly the kind ofexperience that you’ll get by playing TheRoom on a tablet: a near-perfect gameplay in which hardware and softwareblend perfectly and seamlessly in a match made in heaven. Myst, with its use of the mouse to scroll and explore theenvironment, could sometimes be clunky and lack much-needed precision. The Room virtually eliminates theseproblems and offers an amazingly fluid gameplay experience that lets you rotatethe camera in every direction, zoom as much as you want and explore every nookand cranny in the most precise way imaginable. Some enigmas even take advantageof the hardware in a way that’s delightfully imaginative and clever. Of course,the touchscreen may be slightly unresponsive at times, or the camera may bedifficult to position properly; but these are only occasional inconveniencesthat cannot undermine the whole fluidity and efficiency of the gameplay. The Room is an incredibly intuitive Point-and-Clickgame that no aficionado of the genre should miss, for it may well be the gamethat we’ve dreamt about all these years while struggling to position the cursoron the right pixel. Despitebeing a near-perfect and utterly enjoyable Point-and-Click game, The Room has a glaring flaw that cansimply not be ignored: it’s criminally short. A Point-and-Click veteran could easilyclear that game in a single afternoon, especially if they’ve played Myst before. Talk about brevity!However, a short but excellent game is better than a long and boring one, andPoint-and-Click games are still too rare to be sniffed at, no matter howconcise they may be. Given that The Roomcomes with a very fair price tag to boot, there is really very little reason tocomplain. Better purchase that game and enjoy it to the fullest, for there ismuch to love here. Good sales may even encourage other developers to createmore Point-and-Clicks and lead to a rebirth of the genre—who knows? At least,it’s definitely something I would wish for. So, Ireally had a blast playing The Room,and I’m now waiting for the opportunity to play the second installment, whichshould come in a couple of months. I really hope it will be as great as thefirst; but if the reviews are to be believed, it should be the case. As for now,thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Final Fantasy I: Back to the roots of a legend", "date": "18/04/2014", "text": "What can bemore exciting than to play the first installment of a mythical series twenty-sevenyears after its original release? It’s a fantastic opportunity to see how thecraze started and to study the evolution of the said series from a historicalpoint of view. And for a gamer that could never play the said series before dueto a number of reasons, it’s also the thrill of discovering a gaming monumentin perfect chronological order. Of course, Iknow that technically, this is notexactly how the Final Fantasy seriesstarted; for this PSP version is not an exact replica of the originalgame. Developed by Tose and published by Square Enix in 2007(jp/usa) and2008(eu), it’s an enhanced version of the Gameboy Advance remake known underthe name Final Fantasy I&II: Dawn ofSouls, which was itself already an enhanced version of the original. Gee,are things not getting a tad watered-down here? Oh, well. This mythical firstinstallment of a mythical series has already been remade a good number of timesfor different platforms, and I’d wager that this PSP version won’t be the lastone. Whatever floats your boat, Square Enix. That PSP LiftingWhat wehave here is thus the latest iteration of a long line of Final Fantasy I remakes; and as one may expect, it has beenrevamped for the occasion. The graphics are crisp, sleek and glossy, in purePSP-fashion, and a huge amount of details has been added to the sceneries andlayouts. The audio department also enjoyed a good remix: the original themessound gorgeous and more complex than in the former versions, and the soundeffects are smooth and well integrated into the music. (By some ironic twist,the themes from this game reminded me of… ChocoboTales, where they are revisited in what can only be considered pure andunashamed fan-service.)The battlesystem also went through a couple of neat enhancements. The most immediatelynoticeable is the addition, on the battle screens, of new backgrounds that varydepending on which type of terrain you stand on when you engage into fighting.As for the most useful, it has to be the automatic reassignment of attack(s) toanother enemy in case the enemy that was initially targeted dies before yourcharacter(s) can attack it. Let’s remember that this was not present in the NESversion: in that same situation, the character’s turn was purely and simplylost, which forced the player to strategize their attacks a tad more. However,this felt more like a consequence of hardware limitation than like a deeplythough-out design choice; and thus, despite some complaints that thisenhancement removed some of the challenge of the original game, it’s quite awelcome one. Still,let’s not be fooled by those changes, for they are mostly cosmetic andskin-deep only: this PSP version of FFIis basically nothing more than an 8-bit RPG with a sleek, modern look. It may shimmerand bristle with details, but it remains old-school at heart: the design of thetowns, the appearance of the sprites, the dialogue, the world map and, last butnot least, the gameplay, everything screams 8-bit in that game. And that’sexactly what I was expecting. No-frills is the name of the gameI decidedto play that game mostly to fulfill my long-time dream of playing the Final Fantasy series; but I was also quitecurious and interested in it from a historical point of view. What I wanted wasa glimpse into the early stages of J-RPG, into those nearly mythical timeswhere pioneers probed and felt their way through a vast and uncharted newterritory. As I mentioned earlier, I am quite aware that this version of FFI is not the real thing, and that myglimpse may well be taken through a magnifying glass of sorts; but I amconfident that it remains faithful enough to the original to allow somehistorical analysis. And I can always play original 8-bit RPGs later on if myhistorical curiosity about them becomes ravenous. As Istarted playing RPGs during the 16-bit era, the 8-bit RPG and its specificstaples and rules were virtually unknown to me—apart from a few vague notions,as we’ll see later. I was thus thrilled by the prospect of discovering a gamingterritory that was entirely new to me, and I have to admit that I was often surprisedby what I encountered. This made me realize how huge a leap was taken in theRPG department from the 8-bit to the 16-bit era and makes my historicalanalysis all the more fascinating and engrossing. Of course,the first thing to surprise me was the bareness of the whole narrative. Isomehow expected it, but not to that extent; not to the point of starting thegame directly on the world map with my party fully formed and no backstorywhatsoever and having the king ask me straight to rescue his abducted daughterafter barely ten seconds of talking. You sure are fast to trust people, yourhighness!  This sets the mood and isactually the template for the whole game: anytime you reach a new place, youhave to find the specific NPCs who will either ask you to perform whatever taskis needed to save the day or give you some vague clues about how to furtherprogress. In the same vein, the towns are as bare as they can be, featuringonly the basic shops where you can refurbish and the traditional inn and church,sometimes along with a royal castle containing an NPC with a mandatory task toentrust you with. As for your characters, they remain silent through the wholegame and don’t experience any sort of character development. Now this is anunadorned narrative if I ever saw one: everything is clear-cut and minimalist,with no attempt of fleshing out thing whatsoever. This could nearly pass as anartistic statement of sorts, really. Not that it disturbs me at all; I actually have asoft spot for simple storylines, and once I got past my initial wonder, I quiteenjoyed the simplicity and straightforwardness of FFI in that regard. Contrastingstarkly with the conciseness of the narrative is the vastness and openness ofthe world you have to explore. Your travels go mostly unobstructed and hugeareas are accessible nearly from the get-go; as for the occasional obstructions,they are bound to be removed, and quite promptly at that. I was absolutelyblown away by how huge the world map is and how free you are to scour everycorner of it. I certainly didn’t expect thatfrom an 8-bit RPG; I rather expected to be restricted to tiny areas at a timeand constrained to travel a single definite path, the way you are often in…well, 16-bit RPGs. Now, that’s embarrassing. Shouldn’t these changes be seen asa regression of sorts, hum? But once again, it’s fairly interesting to see howthings evolved in just one generation, from an approach where you have toexplore and figure out where you must go by yourself to one where you aresomehow gently guided and pushed to the next available area. Furthermore,FFI features a massive number ofareas that are basically useless. The world map is covered with completelyempty lands, unoccupied except for monsters, and the dungeons brim with vacantrooms and dead ends. Once again, the 16-bit era marked a huge departure fromthis template by creating much tighter level designs in which every singleplace has a purpose. In a 16-bit RPG, following an alleyway in a dungeon or ahidden pass between mountains will lead you to a side quest or to a secrettreasure; in FFI, it will most likelylead you to a dead end. It’s hard to figure out if this was implemented toenhance the thrill of exploring a vast unknown world, which was essentially abrand-new gameplay experience at the time, or to extend the lifespan of thegame, making this a classic case of fake longevity. My guess is that it islikely a well-blended, smooth mix of both. Anotherthing that kind of shocked me is how utterly irrelevant character statisticsare when it comes to fighting. FFIfeatures all your classic stats, like Attack, Defense, Agility and so on; butunlike what you can see in modern RPGs, those stats have little to no influenceon what happens in battles. The Agility stat, for instance, has no impact whatsoeveron the order of attacks: your characters or the enemies will attack purely atrandom, making it impossible to establish any reliable strategy. The othersstats are hardly more relevant: a given character can do different amounts ofdamage to the exact same enemy from one turn to the next, which somehow mockthe Attack stat; the same goes for Defense, with a given character takingvarious amounts of damage from the same enemy from turn to turn. As for Accuracy,well… If you ever want to equip a stronger weapon but hesitate because it wouldlower your Accuracy stat by ten points, don’t bother and go for it: it won’tmake any visible difference on the field. There may be some hidden rules behindthis apparent lack of pattern, but I wouldn’t wager on it; these programminginconsistencies are most likely due of the technical limitations of the time. Thewhole issue makes battles arbitrary and sometimes erratic, but it’s not adeal-breaker, for it doesn’t make the game unplayable; it just makes it somehowrandom and unpredictable when it comes to fighting. Anotherthing I didn’t expect was the total absence of any sort of dungeons puzzles.Dungeons rather follow the labyrinth model, with branching paths and occasionaldead ends, and that really struck me as extremely simplistic. Of course, Ididn’t expect some puzzle galore like in FF:Crystal Chronicles either, and it would be quite unfair to lambast an8-bit RPG for being too simplistic; but on the other hand, The Legend of Zelda,released roughly at the same time on the NES, featured a good number of cleverdungeon puzzles. So it’s not a matter of hardware limitation this time, butmore likely a conscious design choice. FFIwas not meant to be a dungeon puzzles RPG, but rather a 'slaughter-your-way-to-the-bottom-of-the-dungeon' RPG. Whatever floated yourboat, Square.One lastlittle surprise element for the road: the moniker given to your party by NPCsin the game world, which immediately rang a bell. You and your fellowadventurers are referred to as “The Four Warriors of Light”. Just like thequartet of adventurers in Final Fantasy:the Four Heroes of Light, the spin-off released on the DS more than twentyyears later. I love when a series cultivates continuity between its episodes withthe reoccurrence of such details.  The meat and potatoesSo, I wassurprised quite a lot, and that’s a good thing. Not everything took me bysurprise, though; there were some elements that I fully expected to find in FFI, and they didn’t fail to show up. Thefirst of them is one that doesn’t need introduction, for it’s been there sincethe dawn of console RPGs, and it’s been known to be at its most potent andoffensive in the 8-bit era; we’re of course talking about the Grinding, ladiesand gentlemen. Note thatI’m saying the grinding, not the level-grinding.Unlike what one may expect, you don’t need to level-grind that much in FFI; in fact, you hardly need it, exceptif you want to clear the five optional dungeons that have been added to thisversion of the game. Let’s face it: FFIon the PSP is actually a rather easy game. My understanding is that theoriginal was much harder, but over the years and the subsequent rereleases, thedifficulty level had been toned down to follow the evolution of gaming trends;in parallel, new and much harder dungeons were added to provide hardcoreplayers with fitting challenges, should they want to tackle them. But Idigress. I was talking about the grinding—the grinding alone, not thelevel-grinding. Let’s faceit: this game, in pure 8-bit RPG fashion, features metric tons of grinding. This overabundanceis solely due to the extremely high encounter rate. Once you’re out of thesafety of towns, you’re bound to land in a random battle every couple of seconds.The encounter rate varies depending on which area you’re exploring: the oceanhas one of the quietest rates, with one encounter every seven to ten seconds,while the world map is a bit more demanding, with encounters every three to fiveseconds. As you may expect, the worst offenders are the dungeons, which ramp upthe encounter rate to every three seconds or so, with some specific areasthrowing battles at your face literally everysecond. I’m totally serious. And yet, since the game is easy, these randombattles never really pose a threat to your progression. They just test yourpatience, and they do so without pause or mercy. But that’sthe way it’s supposed to be, after all: Grinding is the meat and potatoes of8-bit RPG. And upon playing FFI, Iunderstand much better why. Grinding was mandatory in that game because therewas so very little else to it, and that probably applies to every 8-bit RPGwith heavy emphasis on grinding. The minimal storyline, the imperfect battlesystem, the simplistic dungeon design and the paper-thin characters wouldsimply not be enough to provide a satisfying and fulfilling gameplay experience,were the grinding removed. It had tobe introduced in healthy doses, to flesh out the gameplay and give some densityand depth to the game; it’s the firm and juicy meat around the bare bones that arethe basic architecture of FFI. The samecan be said about the general elusiveness of your objectives, which is anothercharacteristic I expected to find in an 8-bit RPG. Unlike modern RPGs that setyou on rails and tell you very precisely where to go next, FFI gives you only the most basic clues about what you shouldattempt to do and where you should be headed and lets you figure out the restby yourself. (This could be seen as an interesting alternative for dungeonspuzzles, in a way.) And once again, this gives some depth to the game byinvolving the player and making them work for it (whatever ‘it’ may be at anygiven time), which I find somehow more rewarding than being fed every specs ofinformation about where to go and what to do. It can sometimes verge onabstruseness, though, especially in the latter parts of the game. Once again,it’s hard to determine if this was implemented solely to flesh out the game andintroduce a challenge element of sorts or if it was rather a cleverly concealed attempt at fake longevity; and once again, my guess is that it’s most likely a smooth blend of both. The test of timePlaying FFI was an incredibly interestingexperience that taught me a lot and helped me understand better the evolutionof console RPGs, as well as the reason at work behind the prominence of suchclassic 8-bit RPG features as intensive grinding and cryptic progression. Buthistorical analysis alone doesn’t cut it when we’re talking about a videogame;it is certainly worthwhile, but it’s not the primary purpose of gaming. A gamemust be an entertaining and enjoyable experience first and foremost, and thequestion is: does this PSP version of FFIfit the bill? Well, itcertainly does. In fact, it holds itself surprisingly well and manages to offera very engrossing gameplay experience, despite being quite simplistic bytoday’s standards. I find grinding to be both soothing and stimulating once Iget into the rhythm of it, and I love games that manage to say clear-cut andsimple while offering enough to keep me occupied, so I was fully satisfied withmy playthrough of FFI. It’srefreshing to take a break from the sometimes over-inflated modern RPGs: nomandatory cliché character development, no convoluted storyline, no babblinggalore, no malarkey of any sort; just you, the game, and mountains of grinding.So comfortingly simple. I onlyregret that this PSP version was made so much easier than the original. I neverfelt truly endangered on the field, neither during my millions of randombattles nor during the boss fights, which I usually cleared in just a couple ofturns. Since I never ran away from any encounter, I became quickly overleveledand overloaded with useless money. Worse, I hardly ever used any of my itemsbecause there was simply no need for it. I feel there is a balance problemhere, and it steals away a part of the challenge: it’s never stimulating tohave mountains of currency that you can’t spend and tons of items that youdon’t need to use in a RPG. This imbalance is particularly blatant when itcomes to the difficulty level: the main quest lifted from the NES game hasbeen made incredibly easy, but the optional dungeons (four imported from theGBA version and one exclusive to that PSP version) are ridiculously hard andcan’t be cleared lest you grind for hours or wait until the end of the game totackle them (probably both, in fact). I would definitely have preferred a higherand more unified difficulty level like in the original, which would haveprovided a smoother and more balanced experience. Once again, this is quite amodern feature, obviously designed to accommodate both the hardcore and thecasual RPG player, and I feel it doesn’t really belong in an 8-bit RPG—be it aremake. Oh, well.As forunderstanding better how the FinalFantasy craze started, which was another reason that prompted me to playthat game… Well, I’m still left in the dark when it comes to this. While I canobviously feel the appeal of that game and can honestly say that I enjoyedevery minute of it, I somehow fail to see how it could be a smashing success tothe point of single-handedly salvaging a whole company from the engulfing pitsof bankruptcy. Many ideas are lifted straight from the slightly older Dragon Quest series and what is original to the game is rather nondescriptand unmemorable. I guess it's something you can only understand in context: youhad to be around in the 8-bit era and see this happen to feel the importance ofthat game and be properly swept away by it. Given that Europe was mostlydeprived of 8-bit RPGs, even more so than North America which was already notso spoiled in the matter, I simply couldn’t experience this game in itsrightful original context. And it’s not something I can recreate by any means,especially after having played RPGs from latter eras. But what Igarnered from this game was sufficient to delight me, so I’m not complaining.It provided me with excellent hours of gameplay and a deeper understanding ofthe evolution of RPGs, and I’m quite grateful for that. More than that, I’mactually craving more 8-bit RPGs. The next milestone to satisfy my historicalappetite will most likely be the DragonWarrior I&II remake on the Game Boy Color. The very first installment of themythical Dragon Quest series, neverreleased in Europe, handed on a handheld plate: what could be more excitingthan this?

{"title": "Shiren the Wanderer (1): I’m in love with a roguelike ", "date": "09/04/2014", "text": "It’s nevertoo late to fall in love. Especially with a gaming genre. 'Roguelike'is a term I had encountered before in my gaming life and was vaguely familiarwith. It’s fair to say that I knew at least the basics of the genre. I knewthat the name 'Roguelike' was derived from Rogue,a cross-platform game released in 1980 that defined the mechanics of the genre.I knew that the said Rogue somehowsingle-handedly created dungeon-crawling as a gaming style, while at the sametime setting itself apart from yet-to-be dungeon crawlers by sporting specificfeatures like permadeath and random level generation. And, last but not least,I knew roguelikes were supposed to be hardcore and unforgiving. This, added tothe fact that the most famous ones belonged to the PC realm, cemented my visionof roguelikes as games beyond my reach; games I knew about but would neverplay, mostly because I’m not a PC gamer, and maybe also a little bit because oftheir fabled difficulty. And thencame Shiren the Wanderer on the DS, a game that blew away all those misconceptionsand made me discover the delicious, pungent flavour of Roguelikes.  Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer, released on the DS in 2006(jp) and2008(na/aus/eu), is quite an interesting game. It was developed by Chunsoft andis part of the Mystery Dungeonseries, which I introduced earlier in my posts about Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. Shirenis the only Mystery Dungeon gamefeaturing completely original characters instead of characters pulled out froma well-known series; and it’s also by far the hardest Mystery Dungeon game and the truest to classic Roguelike mechanics.It was initially released on the Super Famicom in 1995, and quickly enjoyed ahuge popularity in Japan, which motivated Chunsoft to release no less than fivesequels over a period of 15 years. Meanwhile, the western world remained widelyunaware of this series and firmly set on the belief that Roguelike=PC=Diablo; that is, until Sega decided topublish a DS port of the original game in Japan and then, seemingly guided by adivine inspiration, to bring it to the West in order to expand our gaminghorizons. We then discovered that there were indeed console Roguelikes—andexcellent ones at that; but I’m getting ahead of myself there. First impressionsOne canhardly talk about Shiren the Wandererwithout mentioning first its graphics and soundtrack. Roguelikes beingrepetitive games by nature, it’s nearly mandatory to have graphics and musicthat are pleasant enough to the senses and will not bore the player to deathafter a few replays. And fortunately, Shiren totally shines in thesedepartments. The graphics are clearly lifted straight from the Super NES era,with no visible enhancement; but they manage to convey some charm and create areally unique atmosphere, despite being undeniably primitive by today’sstandards. As for the music themes, well… They are truly splendid. Composed byKoichi Sugiyama of Dragon Quest famealong with co-composer Hayato Matsuo, they are soulful, gorgeous pieces of earcandy that accomplish the tour de forceof never becoming boring to the ear. Ever.Many of them have a cinematic quality and wouldn’t feel out of place in amovie, and they play a massive part in giving you the feeling that you areinvolved in a fascinating adventure. And if you’re familiar with the Dragon Quest games or with their soundtracks, you should click immediatelywhen hearing the Pegasus Ridge theme, which is a more complex take on the WorldMap theme from the first Dragon Questgames. Let’s broadenthe picture and talk about the general atmosphere of the game. The very sweetand lovely atmosphere, shall I say: for Shirenmay kill you routinely and without mercy, but at the same time, it treats youwith an atmosphere so gentle and loveable that you always want to come back toit and play more. I find this to be an extremely clever design choice: insteadof conveying a gritty or dark setting that could increase the discouragement alreadycaused by repeated deaths and prompt you to simply give up, this game puts youat ease with its lovely setting and makes you feel that dying over and over isnot such a huge problem after all. And whileI’m mentioning clever design choices, kudos must be given to the sheer brillianceof the random level design. It’s not brilliant per se, mind you, for no random level design can ever be consideredtruly clever. But in the context of Shiren,a game in which you are bound to replay levels over and over, it’s pure genius.Random level generation saves you the unbearable boredom of having to replaythe same exact levels and provides some constant freshness to yourexplorations. By somestrange and ironic twist, Shiren firstreminded me of the Platformers of my youth. In the 8 and 16-bit era, you simplycouldn’t avoid Platformers: they were ubiquitous and pretty much the dominantgenre, and despite not being too fond of them, I played them just like anybodyelse. And I really found some similarities in the process of dying over andover and progressing a bit further—or not, as we’ll see later— every time. Theplatformers of old, especially the harcore ones, would submit the player to asimilar test of patience with their die&retry approach; but that’s prettymuch where the similarities end. Shirenis much, much deeper than any platformer, hardcore or not, and it doesn’t takelong to notice that. I already mentioned the highly clever level design thatsaves you the boredom induced by many of these platformers with theirnever-changing layouts, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. Let’s nowexplore the depths of Shiren’sgameplay!Diving into the gameTo put itbluntly and candidly, Shiren is oneof the most fulfilling gaming experiences I’ve ever had. This wasdefinitely not what I expected when I picked up that game, and I was utterlysurprised by this turn of events. What I expected was a punishing, frustratingand unrewarding game that would beat me to a pulp, because that’s the way Shiren was pictured in most reviews.What I discovered instead was a deep and engrossing game promoting patience,perseverance, strategic thinking and planning, all things I totally lap up ingames. Shiren is the perfect gamingillustration of the Japanese gaman,which is the notion of enduring seemingly unbearable circumstances withdignity and patience. Like, the dignity of not smashing your DS on the floorwhen you die in the most stupid and unpredictable way and the patience to forge aheadwith a smile instead.Not thatdeath is a problem at all in Shiren,oh no; perish the thought. (Ha-ha. Erm…Sorry.) Far from being an occurrence to be avoided at all costs or a punishmentof sorts for your lousy gameplay, dying is part of the process of progressingthrough the game. It acts as a reset function that will allow you to furtheradvance side quests: to put it simply, each run until you die is a loop, duringwhich you can perform some actions only once. If you want to perform the saidactions another time, you will have to die—or to use the “give up” command inthe menu, which is technically the same as dying, only you decide to do so.This will save the progression you made in side quests and send you back to thebeginning of the game, from which you can restart and further progress. This may bea bit too abstract, so let’s take examples. Recruiting allies is a process thatincludes several steps: you have to first meet them and talk to them, uponwhich they will either trick you or ignore you somehow. (I love how thisdiffers from what you usually see in J-RPGs, where people you just met areready to follow you to the end of the world after just five minutes of chatting.Shiren brings a healthy dose ofrealism to this whole party members matter.) If you want to recruit them forgood, you will have to die/restart a few times in a row and interact with themevery time until they finally join your party. The same goes for upgradingweapons at the local smithies: you can only do so once per run in every givensmithy, so you’ll have to die/restart to repeat the process. As itscore, Shiren is a purely iterativeprocess. You progress through the game by increments, creating some accretionof experience and knowledge as you do so. The good old trick of level-grindingwon’t get you far in Shiren: it’s alla matter of learning and building up solid bases that will lead you further andfurther into the game. In that regard, no run is totally useless: even theshortest one is likely to teach you something or help you advance a side quest.This is a fascinating experience, not unlike learning a new language, with itsspecific grammar and set of rules. You may learn at you own expense thatthrowing an item at an NPC will prompt the said NPC to retaliate by punchingyou to death, or that some of your allies are not as reliable as others. Thislearning factor is a key element in Shiren.Far from feeding you endless tutorials, this game lets you figure out its manyrules mostly by yourself. The instruction manual gives you only the most basicinformation regarding menu navigation, completed in-game by random tips andclues offered by NPCs; as for the rest, you’ll have to try, observe, and learnaccordingly. No hand-holding there: it’s just you, your brain, and the game.This is trial-and-error, only applied to a whole game world instead of justspecific traps in a level; and it’s incredibly stimulating and thrilling. Notonly that, but this learning process will carry on through the whole game, fromthe first dungeon floor to the last, keeping the game fresh and challenging upto the very end. And youwill need all the knowledge you can get, along with clever planning andhoneying of your equipment: for Shirenis an unpredictable beast, and one that can lash at you when you least expectit. There is definitely an element of randomness and unpredictability to thatgame, which adds to the challenge and forces you to use all your knowledge tothe fullest. You never know what to expect from a dungeon floor, let alone froma whole run. You may die at the first floor surrounded by a mass of enemies, oryou may have a massive breakthrough and make it all the way to a floor younever reached before. You have to learn to bend circumstances to your advantageand get hold of the game’s randomness, and this is a truly fascinating andexciting thing to do, especially when you finally succeed.It’s worthnoting that Shiren, while beingdemanding, remains fair to the player. The difficulty curve is well-balancedand quite regular, and you will definitely notice and feel your own progress. To breeze through a dungeon floor that feltincredibly difficult just a few hours before is a sheer joy, and one that isbound to repeat itself through the whole game. Shiren shows even more fairness by giving you the possibility totrain yourself and get the feel of the various traps awaiting you before you encounter them for real indungeons. This can be done in the so-called Fey’s Dungeon at the very beginningof the game, where you will be offered fifty puzzles of strategic nature withincreasing difficulty levels. These puzzles replicate situations that canhappen in dungeons, and mastering them will definitely give you some strategicadvantage and an edge over your many foes, on top of being an absolute treatfor puzzle lovers. So, that’s Shiren in a nutshell, from a beginner’spoint of view. I’ve now played the game for 15 hours, reached floor 17, and I’mtaking my sweet time. I’m planning to play this game as a red thread over thecourse of several weeks, maybe months, and I will of course give my finalthoughts on the matter when I’m done with it. But for now, I plainly and simplyadore it. I adore it so much that I’m firmly planning to buy the full series,which will give me a great incentive to dive back into my long-forsakenJapanese studies. I just can’t let aseries that good pass me by. Thisprompts me to mention how poorly received was Shiren in the West, for it may well be the reason why we didn’t getto play the subsequent installments. Critics lambasted Shiren for being too unforgiving, punishing and not rewardingenough, to the point where I actually formed the mental picture of a game thatwas more torture than entertainment and would whip me good and shatter my soul.None of this happened, as I stated above; far from it, I actually found Shiren to be easier—yes, easier—and globally much more forgiving than I hadexpected. This is the Avalon Codesyndrome all over again: a good game that is dismissed and sniffed at becauseit’s at odds with the current gaming trends. In the era of generalhand-holding, intrusive in-games tutorials and scripted games playing on rails,the notions of figuring out a game’s mechanics on your own and progressingthrough increments while doing so was not likely to make a hit. Which is ashame, for Shiren is quite the gem.Oh, well.That’s allabout Shiren for the time being.Expect at least another post on the matter when I’m done with the game, andmaybe more, if it inspires me. As for now, thanks for reading, and be my guestanytime!(Edit: The rest of my Shiren epopee can be found here, there and there.)"},
{"title": "Gaming Haul: The March session", "date": "30/03/2014", "text": "I would like to offer a gaming schedule ofsorts, so that you know what kind of content you can expect from that blog.I’ve met this feature on others gaming blogs, and I find it to be quite neat;unfortunately, I also find myself totally unable to emulate this process. Thereason is that when it comes to choosing games to play, I entirely follow myinstinct and my inspiration of the moment. Even when I happen to have plansregarding the next game I’m going to tackle, these plans can be disrupted atthe very last minute by a sudden, unexpected fancy to play a totally differentgame from the one I initially had in mind.So yes, I’m totally unable to offer anykind of reliable gaming schedule, and I regret that. But there is somethingelse I can offer, something I have no shortage of raw material for: acomprehensive video game haul, detailing my latest purchases in the field.While this is by no means akin to a real set-in-stone schedule and tends to bea slightly narcissistic affair, it can still give a fair idea of the games thatwill be featured and covered here, in the near or distant future. So, here wego!Senran Kagura Burst (3ds): Basically, I wanted anotherBeat’em Up to erase the wave of disappointment that washed over me whileplaying Code of Princess. I read invarious reviews that Senran Kagura Burst was similar to my beloved Streets of Rage, and that was all Ineeded to purchase that game. That, and nothing else. Nothing, I said. I’m a serious gamer, damnit!DevilSummoner: Soul Hackers (3ds): Not too much to sayabout this one. It’s a first-person dungeon crawler, and since I love dungeoncrawlers to pieces, in any shape or form, I just couldn’t let it pass me by. Ididn’t play the original Saturn version, so it will be a completely freshexperience—that is, as fresh as a genre that has been around for roughly threedecades can be. Toukiden:the Age of Demons (Vita): I wanted a game similarto Monster Hunter, only a tad moreaccessible. I found the Japanese trailer of Toukidensomewhere on the internet and really loved what I saw. The characters, theweapon system, the general atmosphere and even the voice acting (something thatusually makes me cringe in videogames) totally clicked with me and the nextthing I knew, I had ordered that game.Danganronpa:Trigger Happy Havoc (Vita): Despite the fact that Ican’t remember its title correctly and routinely tend to replace “happy” with“heavy” for no good reason, and despite the fact that the characters sport themost ridiculous haircuts I’ve ever seen in a videogame, this one really piquedmy curiosity. I’ve never played a full-blown visual novel before, and I’mreally eager to see what kind of gaming experience Danganronpa will offer me. Since the sequel is currently beinglocalized and will be released in a few months, I really hope this will turnout to be a great game.EveryExtend Extra (PSP): I usually snub casual games,but the concept of this one seemed really interesting, with its combination oftrippy music and space shooter-inspired mechanics. And it cost me only 0.01£,so that won’t be a huge loss if it turns out to be miserable after all.Final Fantasy I (PSP): As much as it shames me to confessit, I have never played a canon FinalFantasy game. Ever. (Yeah, I know. I’ll whip myself with nettles to atone forthis, I promise.) I did play various spin-offs, like the Seiken Densetsu games, FFCrystal Chronicle: Ring of Fates, andlately, Chocobo Tales; however, the main games have always eluded me, mostlybecause I never owned the systems that hosted them, and they remained a distantdream for many years. But now that many of the series’ entries are being slowlybut surely rereleased on portable systems, I can finally indulge into mylong-lived fantasy (ha-ha) of playing these games. And since I’m quite themethodical gamer, I absolutely wanted to start with the very first entry of theseries, hence this purchase. Half-minuteHero (PSP): I was not too keen on buying this oneat first, since I tend to dislike fast-paced, hectic games that demand tocomply with a timer’s limitations. But just to be sure I was not missing out ona gem, I checked a few videos on the internet; and to my utter surprise, I wasimmediately enthralled by what I saw. From the seemingly fulfilling and clevergameplay mechanics to the nostalgia-inducing 8-bit graphics, everything in thatgame screamed “Buy Me”. Which I gladly did.  CapcomClassic Collection Reloaded (PSP): I bought thiscompilation solely for the Ghosts’nGoblins Trilogy featured on it. This was not a nostalgia affair, since Inever played these games back in the days; moreover, I know how infamouslyhardcore they are supposed to be, and under normal circumstances, I wouldn’thave touched them with a pole for fear of losing my sanity. But lately, Iwatched a playthrough of all three games, and as I did, I found myself reallyyearning to play them, despite how brutally hard they were. Next thing, I foundthis PSP compilation and decided to go for it. And while I’m at it, I will ofcourse give a try to the other games when I’m done with G’n G.UltimateGhosts’n Goblins (PSP): The purchase of this game isa logical continuation from the purchase of the sub mentioned CCC Reloaded. Like I said, I am quitethe methodical gamer, and when I start a new series, I usually want to own allthe episodes of the said series. Before I even play a single one, yes. That’show I am.Prinny:Can I Really Be the Hero? (PSP): I saw a video ofthat game, and I loved it, period. I usually carefully avoid platformers, andI’ve read that this one is a particularly challenging one, which was anotherreason to steer clear of it; but really, the way it looked and played on thescreen just captured my soft gamer’s heart. Riviera: the Promised Land (PSP): I’ve heard about the Gameboy Advance version of that game, and howit showed interesting idiosyncrasies that set it apart from most RPGs. I firstintended to purchase that GBA version, since I’m a bit of a purist, but the rarityand the collateral ludicrous prices of those original cartridges quickly unravelledmy resolution. Then, much to my relief, I discovered this very reasonablypriced PSP port, and voilà: one moregame in my collection. AtelierAnnie: Alchemist of Sera Island (DS): I’ve had myeye on that game for a very, verylong time. A couple of years, in fact. The reason why I didn’t buy it earlieris because most available copies are shockingly, outrageously, ridiculously expensive—that,and the usual issue of having to find a seller kind enough to ship to Europe,since Atelier Annie was only releasedin North-America. So, I braced myself for a long and gruesome wait, and startedchecking various buying platforms regularly in order to dig up an awesome deal,all the while hoping for a hypothetical European release. But when it becameclear that neither of these miracles would happen, and when my desire to try anAtelier game threatened to becomeoverwhelming, I let out a resigned sigh and finally decided to cross theRubicon and purchase it, no matter how much it would cost me. I ended up paying90$ for my copy, so I really, reallyhope it will live up to my expectations.  Tales of Phantasia (GBA): The very first entry of the Tales series, initially released on theSNES, and revamped for the Gameboy Advance. I’m far from being an expert in allthings Tales, but I’m definitely interestedin the series, and I absolutely wanted to see how it all started. And it’s mostcertain that the retro flavour of that game will totally delight me. FinalFantasy V Advance (GBA): I’m patiently collectingevery Final Fantasy entry rereleasedon portable systems, and this purchase is part of the process. The only entriesmissing in my collection now are the freshly released Final Fantasy X/X-2 on the Vita and the ridiculously overpriced Final Fantasy VI Advance. Better start saving for this one right away, o yesprecious.Well, these were my latest purchases—butcertainly not the last, perish the thought. All these games will be coveredhere, in a few weeks or a few months; and hopefully, they will all turn out tobe great gaming experiences. As for now, thanks for reading, and be my guestanytime!"},
{"title": "Rhapsody-a Musical Adventure: A cheerful and lovely treat", "date": "24/03/2014", "text": "I havepiles and piles of RPGs of massive magnitude in my treasured collection. Bravely Default, a Link between Worlds, DragonQuest IV to VI on the DS, all the FinalFantasy titles that ever graced handhelds, you name them. They are allhere, waiting to be picked up and played, and somehow begging for theopportunity to lavish their awesomeness on me. And yet, for some reason, I keepsnubbing them and instead anoint some little-known RPGs to grace my precious DS’slot. Like Rhapsody: a Musical Adventure. Rhapsody: a Musical Adventure, developed by Nippon Ichi Softwareand released in 2008(jp/na) and 2009(eu/au) for the Nintendo DS, is a remake ofa Playstation game of the same name released a good ten years earlier. It’s arather mellow and easygoing game obviously aimed at a young audience, and maybemore specifically at kids wanting to get their first bite of RPG without havingto put up too much of a fight to get through. Playingthat game when you’re a RPG veteran is like ordering fast-food or cheap Chinesetakeaway when you’re a seasoned cook: you know that you could do so much betterand feel a bit ashamed of your own laziness, but you nonetheless appreciate thedish because it really tastes quite nice, and because it’s oh so good to let goand relax once in a while.The LovelyRhapsody casts you in the boots of Cornet Espoir, anorphan teenager who one fateful day meets the kingdom’s prince in the localforest and—drums rolling—falls in love with him at first sight and vows toconquer his heart. Yeah, I know exactlywhat you’re thinking here. I was thinking the same, until I discovered betterby playing the game. Granted, the story seems horrendously déjà-vu at firstsight, bristling with tropes so worn out that you can see through them: thebrave orphan, the fairy godmother-like creature protecting her, the residentspoiled bitch, the kind-hearted prince and so on. But the game manages to avoidfalling into cliché abuse territory by putting a humorous twist to nearly everysituation. For instance (spoiler),early in the game, you have to enter a beauty pageant at the royal castle andfind a fancy dress in order to do so. I was ready to roll my eyes and perform afacepalm, until I discovered that this quest implied exploring a BBQ restaurantfull of enemies before dueling with cats wanting to roast you and basicallyturn you into Today’s Special. The quest culminates with you discovering afurry outfit instead of a fancy dress, taking it home on the inspired advice ofyour fellow fairy guardian Kururu and… parading in front of the prince wearingthat stuff at the beauty pageant. (endof spoiler) Yep. When I saw that, I knew I was in safe territory, with clichéindulgence avoided, and breathed a sigh of relief. As a whole, the story andcharacters pack up some unexpected complexity and turn out to be deeper thanyou’d expect from this kind of game, while avoiding the pitfalls of stereotypedstoryline and character development. The resident bitch remains a bitch, butshe reveals a rather complex personality and ends up being quite endearing.Cornet travels around the world to fulfill a personal quest, but messes thingsup as she goes and earns people’s animosity instead of making everything betterin classic RPG fashion. The prince falls in love with Cornet not because she’sthe prettiest girl around, but because she stands out as a loveable weirdo. Thenthere is the musical feature hinted at in the game’s title, which has thecharacters breaking into singing mode at some points in the story andexpressing their feeling through soulful tunes. It’s fairly original to say theleast, and if you love musicals and Japanese singing, you’ll lap this up. Andif you don’t, which is my case, you still have the blessed option of skippingall the numbers.Gameplay-wise,Rhapsody is old-school at heart. Itfeatures your classic four-member party with various abilities, all sorts ofclassic healing items and pieces of gear and good ol’ random battles. Theseasoned RPG veteran will feel at home here, and the newcomer will be given theopportunity to discover the wonderful world of classic RPG in a cute andlovely setting. Battlestake place on a separate screen and are displayed in a side view similar to theone used in Final Fantasy I and II on the PSP. There is nothingspecial to say about them, as they feature a fairly classic turn-based systemand fairly classic attacks and abilities, but I’d like to mention one special twistthat sets them a bit apart. By using her buffing and healing abilities, whichshe performs by playing her trademark horn, Cornet can fill up a special meter takingthe shape of a music sheet line that will allow her to perform special attacksinvolving all sorts of sugary delicacies being thrown at enemies. Don’t befooled by the apparent goofy cuteness of the whole thing, for these attacks arequite powerful and can do miracles when fighting bosses. I usually don’t resortto buffing abilities all that much when playing RPGs, but I found myselfdiligently using them in Rhapsody justfor the sake of these amazing special attacks. Well done, NIS.  As a whole,Rhapsody is a surprisingly well-balancedgame. It actually manages to balance gameplay elements much more efficientlythan some high-profile titles, which is somewhat unexpected and ironic. Thenumber of items and pieces of gear available is just right: there are enough ofthem to give you a decent range of customization options (albeit rather classicones, granted), but no so much that your head will be reeling when browsingthrough a shop’s inventory. The financial balance, if I may say so, is alsoquite neat: if you don’t shy away from battles, you will reap just the rightamount of money to buy the best items and pieces of gear, without having togrind for it nor ending up swimming in it àla Uncle Scrooge. And since I’m mentioning them, battles were quite thenice surprise in Rhapsody. They arevery short and dynamic but numerous, with a random encounter rate much higherthan what I expected to find in a game like this. The sweet point is that youlevel up quite fast, and if you don’t run away from battles, you should bestrong enough to tackle any challenge that comes your way, which is yet again thesignature of a neatly balanced game. (I only needed to level-grind a tad beforethe final boss battles, but since this happened at the very end of the game, itwas quite tolerable.) Even sweeter, your numerous extra party members who areleft on the sidelines level up as well (though a bit slower than your activeparty members), which allows you to change the composition of your party on thefly and indulge into delightful experiments. The Crappy Of course,if Rhapsody did everything right, itwould be a lot more famous than it actually is. This is a relatively unknowngame, and there is a good reason for that. There are a couple of them, in fact,all answering to the big boss that rules them all, which is none other than themighty and ubiquitous Laziness. This is not its first foray into gaming, and itcertainly won’t be its last, sadly.First, Rhapsody doesn’t shine when it comes tographics.There is nothing inherently wrong with them and they don’thinder the gameplay in any way; they are just extremely dull and unremarkable. They don’t even have some kind of retro, 16-bit era flavour that could appealto the soft hearts of older gamers by triggering nostalgia. (Think Children of Mana or From the Abyss for good examples of such a graphic choice on theDS.) On top of that, the perspectives chosen by the developers are oftenfrankly weird and rather uncomfortable to look at; they also tend to changefrom one screen to the next, which is confusing and gives an untidy, messyfeeling to the game. (The royal castle is a particularly serious offender.) There isalso a slight problem with repetitiveness. No, a rather huge one, in fact. Thisgame recycles itself shamelessly, serving you the same environments ad nauseam. To put it bluntly, there isone single design for all the stony dungeons, one for all the caves, and onefor all the forests. It would already be rather boring if the graphics weretop-notch; but as I’ve mentioned before, they are not, which transforms theexperience of crawling through dungeons into a massive snooze fest faster thanyou can say “this decor again?” Theonly environments that were granted a bit of variety in terms of design are thetowns; this makes very little sense since in classic RPG fashion, you spendmost of your playing time trudging through dungeons. Oh, well. To add insult toinjury, the developers, in their folly, seemingly tried to compensate for therepetitiveness of dungeon layouts by transforming the said dungeons intolabyrinths of sorts. Imagine having to find your way and backtrack into stringsof similar-looking rooms crisscrossing through multiple floors and you’ll havea good idea of how unpractical this turns out to be. The map displayed on thetop screen fortunately helps a little, but you’d better have excellent visualmemory and be extremely methodical if you want to progress swiftly through thedungeons without getting lost. And even if you manage to navigate throughdungeons without a hitch, there is still the small issue of how utterly boringit can be to plod through identical screens over the course of your entireplaythrough. Good thing that the game turned out to be so short, with credits rolling after roughly ten hours of gameplay, or it would have been unbearable. Asyou may expect from a game that is so decidedly old-fashioned, Rhapsody also features this good ol’staple of reusing the same sprites for enemies and lazily swapping colours tomark differences in terms of level and strength; but this is such a classicfixture in old-school RPGs that it has become nearly endearing over the years,and thus I won’t chastise the game for that. Let’s just say that theseshameless colour palette swaps fit into the general repetitiveness of Rhapsody pretty well. There seemsto be another issue related to the Playstation version of the game. As Imentioned earlier, this DS version of Rhapsodyis supposed to be a remake of the Playstation version; and it is indeed aremake, only a somewhat downgraded one. The main reason for this lies in the drasticalterations made to the battle system, which was transformed into something muchmore basic. The Playstation original featured a grid-based battle system à la Disgaea, which in the DS versionwas replaced by this old-fashioned FFI-likebattle system I’ve exposed earlier. Now, I’ve not played the original, so I hadno expectations about what the DS version of Rhapsody should play like and I approached it as a standalone game;but I can understand the disappointment of gamers who played the originalversion and were served this dusty and archaic battle system instead of thegrid-based one they may have expected. This feels pretty much like a lack ofcommitment and dedication on NIS’ part, especially since the DS could perfectly have handled grid-based battles, and adds to the general lazinesspermeating this whole game. As a whole,it’s fair to say that Rhapsodysuffers from a general lack of greatness, and feels more like a work of sloththan a work of love. It’s not broken at all, that much is sure, but it’sabsolutely and completely unremarkable in every single field. Even the musicaltheme, the humorous tone or the treat-based attacks are basically nothing morethan gimmicks: granted, they are unusual and rather unexpected in a RPG, and theymay be cute and enjoyable when playing the game, but they certainly won’t remainengraved in your memory nor make Rhapsodymore memorable as a whole. And yet,not every game needs to be a paragon of awesomeness. As I said, it is fine torelax and play a laid-back and unpretentious game once in a while, and Rhapsody is the perfect candidate forthis kind of soothing experience. Its curious blend of old-school RPGmechanics, original gimmicks and mellow pace may not remain embedded in yoursoul until your dying day, but it may well offer you a couple of hours oflight-hearted fun. As for me, after this sweet palate cleanser, I will turn myattention to something a tad grander in scope. (Or will I? You never know wheremy gaming instinct may lead me.) Thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Code of Princess: Oh what a royal mess", "date": "12/03/2014", "text": "Granted,this was a cheap pun; but this game deserves it, because it’s full of cheappuns itself. This game deserves it because it’s just plain cheap, period. Okay, let’sbe a tad more measured here, and let’s elaborate a little bit. Code of Princess is one of these gamesthat had everything to be great but ended up being just average becausesomehow, laziness or uninspired thinking took over during development. Releasedin 2012(jp/na) and 2013(eu/aus) for the 3ds, it was developed by AgastumaEntertainment and published by Atlus, which should have been a guaranty ofawesomeness. I have some kind of pavlovian reflex that makes me associate Atluswith great material and purchase blindly any game they release, and it usuallypays off beautifully; but this time, they somehow missed the mark when pickingup Code of Princess, which is annoyinglysubpar and fails to provide the sense of enjoyment, originality and quirkinessthat most Atlus titles have in spades.I have tomention that I didn’t purchase Code ofPrincess while mistaking it for a RPG, which could have explained mydisappointment. Despite Atlus’ attempts to market it as a RPG of sorts, I knewfrom the very start that this was a Beat’em Up, which is the very reason why Ipicked it up. See, I enjoy playing a good Beat’em Up every once in a while:it’s a welcome and refreshing change from the genres I usually favour, and it’sperfect to let out the steam and indulge into some crazy button mashing. Alongwith Brawlers, Beat’em Ups are actually my fourth favourite gaming genre. (Andwhat is the third, you may ask? Well, I’ll come to that sooner or later, he he.)Granted, I’ve not played scores of them in my gaming life, but the few I playedremain embedded into my memory. For instance, I have the fondest memories of Streets of Rage on the Megadrive/Genesisback in the early 90’s, which I played with my sister in some crazy, heated andamazingly fun co-op sessions.So yes, I wanteda Beat’em Up, and I was delighted to get one with a medieval setting ofsorts; for despite my undying love for Streetsof Rage, I was never too fond of the gritty urban setting of that game. Iwas thus more than ready to welcome Codeof Princess with open arms and I really, really wanted to love it. Alas,that was not meant to be, for this game has failed me in too many ways todeserve my unconditional love. It would be exaggerated to say that I hate thatgame, but I certainly don’t adore it either. I somehow appreciate it, andoccasionally enjoy it, but my love doesn’t go any deeper than this. That sticky, mushy RPG glossLike Isaid, Code of Princess was heavilymarketed as a Beat’em Up with a strong and distinctive RPG flavour. This seemedlike a great pairing on paper, a mix that could have paved the way for totalawesomeness by coupling the better of two worlds. The resulting offspring ofthat unlikely coupling, however, is fairly unimpressive at best and teethgrinding-inducing at worst.Theintention was good, yes, but the execution is decidedly poor. For someunfathomable reason, the developers chose to pick up the pettiest and mostannoying aspects of RPGs for inclusion in Codeof Princess, deliberately ignoring the most pleasant ones. They could havepicked out the Branching Storylines, the One-for-all-All-for-one Party Fightingor the Kick-ass Invocations, giving thus a refreshing lifting to the Beat’em Upgenre; instead, they extracted the Level-Grinding, the Million Useless Piecesof Gear and the Plain Vanilla Story. Great selection, sirs, really. The Level-Grinding,yes. The one aspect most RPG players could do without, or at least withslightly less of. If there is one thing I do NOT want to encounter in a Beat’emUp, it’s definitely Level-Grinding. I mean, I precisely play Beat’em Ups to geta break from level-grinding, not to have more of it shoved down my throat! In Code, all characters start at Lv. 1 andlevel up through the game as they fight; in parallel, all enemies also havehigher and higher levels as the stages unfold. This basically means that if youwant to be able to switch characters during a playthrough, you will have to levelup each one of them individually as the game progresses in order to make them strongenough to tackle the upcoming stages; and as you may imagine, this does involvelevel-grinding, which in this game takes the form of replaying stages over andover again. This is an absolute pain and feels more like a strenuous chore thana rewarding process. Not only that, but the game regularly throws at you somedifficulty spikes that will corner you into forced level-grinding, which is acomplete heresy in a Beat’em Up to start with: this is typically the kind ofgame that should be cleared while relying solely on your finely honed skills,not on some cheap and brainless level grinding process. I’m here to beat thehell out of trash mobs like there’s no tomorrow, not to plod through alreadyplayed stages in order to power up pathetically weak characters! Let me kicksome fresh butts already, damnit!The MillionUseless Pieces of Gear is another RPG trope I could have done without, thankyou very much. Every time you clear a stage, you get some new pieces ofequipment, along with money that will allow you to buy even more pieces ofequipment into the game’s unique shop (which is actually nothing more acheap-looking menu display. Oh, well.) Let’s face it: most of this equipment iscompletely useless. There are way too many items available and trying to keeptrack of them is seriously cumbersome and irritating, and the clunky browsinginterface doesn’t help matters either. The effect of most of these items isbarely discernable and often boils down to petty increases and decreases ofsome of your stats that make very little difference when fighting on the field.So yes, this equipment galore is vastly useless; but at least, it’s gracefulenough to remain innocuous and unobtrusive, unlike the aforementioned unwelcomedguest that is Level-Grinding. And last,but certainly not least, is the Plain Vanilla Story. Now, I have to get thisout of my chest: Beat’em Ups DO NOT need stories. If there is one single genreunder the gaming sun that does not need a storyline, it definitely has to be theBeat’em Up genre. A text that rolls when starting the game, à la Streetsof Rage, is all the narrative content one needs when playing a Beat’emUp. But Agatsuma Entertainment thoughthey could do better, them fools, and tried to squeeze a storyline into their game. Theresult is miserable, mostly because it somehow manages to fail in alldepartments. On one hand, since Coderemains a Beat’em Up, it doesn’t give enough room for decent story andcharacter development; as a result, the narrative feels rushed and painfullysuperficial. On the other hand, it still manages to completely break the rhythmof the game by forcing cutscenes on the player at the beginning and at the endof nearly every single stage, which becomes quickly irksome and maddening. Nowthat’s a lose-lose situation if I ever saw one, and the loss is all on theplayer. It creates a jagged gameplay experience that is hard to fully enjoy,even though you can fast-forward through the cutscenes by pressing the Rbutton. Content-wise, the story is, well, plain vanilla: it summons clichécharacters, cliché settings and cliché events and gives them a comical twist ofsorts. Now, I can see what they were trying to do here: Code of Princess is obviously meant to be a tongue-in-cheek J-RPGparody, making fun of all the genre’s tropes in a light-hearted way. Itsucceeds to some extent: some one-liners are definitely clever and humorous,and the game deliciously takes the piss out of a few J-RPG fixtures. But thosemoments of grace are unfortunately too few and far between— for eachwitty one-liner, there are three lame ones— and that attempt at parody nevermanages to fully hit the mark. It ultimately appears half-hearted and shallow,and definitely not as hilarious as one would have hoped. On topof that, there is a blatant issue with this very concept: why on earth would aBeat’em Up try to parody J-RPGs to start with? The ties between these two gaminggenres are tenuous at best, and one fails to see how a Beat’em Up could have anylegitimacy to satirise the J-RPG genre. Frankly, I’d rather see a Beat’em Up pokingfun at Beat’em Up tropes, or a J-RPG debunking J-RPG staples; that would seemmuch more valid and legit and certainly turn out better. It’s hard enough for agaming genre to draw a good caricature of itself without trying to take thepiss out of other genres—especially when the outcome turns out to be so mediocre.The name of the gameNow thatI’ve mercilessly exposed and smeared Code’sclumsy and caked attempt at RPG make-up all over the place, let’s move on tothe core of the game: the butt-kicking. Does this game fulfill its duty to the playerby offering them hours of exhilarating button-mashing fun? Well, I’d like toanswer that question with a beaming “yeaaaaah”; but unfortunately, I can’t. Ican’t, because despite having undeniable strong points, the fighting in Code of Princess is dragged down by aslew of issues that really hinder the gameplay and steal away a massive portionof the entertainment you’d rightfully expect from a Beat’em Up. Granted, thoseare only small issues, mere details in fact: but once combined, they grow more potentand harmful, and very hard to ignore indeed. So here they are, thrown at you ashaphazardly as the stages of that game.—The basicwalking speed is unbearably SLOW. It’s more of a crawl, really, and it makes nosense whatsoever in a game where you are supposed to dive head first intofast-paced fighting. If you want to run, you have to press Left or Right twiceon the D-pad, which is absolutely counter-intuitive and extremely clunky. —There isno dedicated button for jumping. If you want to jump, you have to press Up onthe D-pad or use the analog stick in the upper directions. Once again, it’stotally counter-intuitive and clunky at best. On top of that, jumps arehorribly slow and imprecise, which definitely doesn’t encourage you to put throughthis annoying control scheme to perform them.—Trash mobsare way too strong. They take a million hits to die, and slashing the same meanenemy over and over again until they have the grace to finally let go gets oldand boring really quickly. I would have preferred to face tidal waves ofweaklings rather than a couple of overpowered pests clutching to dear life likelice to a scalp.—Bossbattles are one hot, horrendous mess. On top of the boss, the game throws atyou a cohort of these annoyingly strong trash mobs, along with a few hindering sceneryelements for good measure. As a result, there are so many sprites on the screenthat the battle quickly becomes a complete chaos, in which visually keepingtrack of your character is nearly impossible, let alone follow any kind ofstrategy to kill the boss. More often than not, you’ll end up blindly mashingbuttons until your thumbs cry in pain while hoping that the boss dies before you do, and that is anything butsatisfying and rewarding. —Charactermodels are way too small, and the camera makes it worse by often positioningitself quite far from the action. That may be tolerable when being on the worldmap in a RPG, but Beat’em Ups require more precision and thus bigger sprites, especiallyon a handheld, and Code’s ridiculouslytiny characters don’t quite meet this criterion. As a result, it’s unnecessaryuncomfortable to play. My vision is top-notch, and yet I often found myselfputting the 3ds really close to my nose and goggling at the screen in adesperate attempt to get a better visual grasp of the unfolding action.—As thoughthis tiny sprites problem were not enough, the game hinders you further bythrowing in foregrounds elements that block your vision. This is a level designheresy that should have been left in the 16-bit era crappy platformers where itbelongs, not carried all the way to a 2012 Beat’em up.On top ofthese blatant gameplay issues, I have a few more general gripes to mention:—This gamemakes you meet allies over the course of the storyline, only to let you fightalone in 95% of the stages. This is the DragonQuest IX embarrassing paradox all over again, only reversed: yoursupposedly faithful allies mysteriously disappear when fighting time comes. Dothey chicken out and hide, or sneak away to drink a pint of beer at the local tavern? Sheesh, what a bunch of useless figurants. —Here isanother game that teases you with beautiful and stylish art, gloriously displayedin the booklet and on the box, in order to lure you to buy it; and then, once you’vespent your money, it serves you mediocre cutscenes drawn in a cookie-cutter andseen-a-million-times-before anime style. I hate when games do that. The coverand booklet art should offer honest renditions of what the characters look likein-game, not some enhanced and unfaithful version of them that is bound tocreate disappointment when you finally play the game. —And whilewe’re talking about looks, this game’s presentation is decidedly cheap.Granted, the characters and monsters sprites look great on the field, but the backgroundsare horrendous and look like they are pulled straight from a phone game. Add tothis a clunky and crappy-looking menu interface and you have a game that looksmore like a flash game than a boxed release.  So, hereare the main aggravating points that made me fume during the course of thegame. But it’s not all doom and gloom, fortunately. Despite being globallyunpolished and flawed, Code of Princessalso contains some enjoyable features that can make it worth playing—that is, ifyou’re persistent enough to ignore its faults and soldier on through the game. Nowthat I’ve vented out my frustration and exposed my gripes regarding that game,I can elaborate on these good points. Here we go!—Thecharacters all have very distinct fighting styles, and there are dozens of themto play. To switch characters nearly feels like playing a completely differentgame, and it’s a sheer joy to browse through them and experiment with theirrespective abilities. —As aresult, the game has a HUGE replay value. Not only can you go again through themain story with each one of the four characters in your party, but you can alsoplay individual stages with other characters. It would probably take dozens ofhours of play to master all the subtleties of each available character’sfighting style; we’re definitely far from Streetsof Rage’s meagre trio of heroes that all recycle the same moves.—Thecharacters are stylish. They each have their own stance, attitude and set ofinterjections when fighting, and their respective personalities shinegloriously during those fights. Much more so than during the cutscenes, shall Isay, which is quite ironic and further proves that Beat’em Ups don’t neednarrative at all. Let the fists do the talking!—Despiteappearances, Code of Princess is notjust another fan service-laden title that uses a scantily clad heroine to sellitself. It’s quite the opposite, in fact: it gloriously takes the piss out ofthe often ridiculous and over-the-top fan service present in many Japaneseproductions. Instead of acting like it’s perfectly fine and dandy for a womanto go on a battlefield wearing only her underwear, characters incredulouslycomment on Solange’s ludicrous outfit, to which she boldly replies that this isthe latest fashion at court, thus pointing out the foolishness of both fashionand excessive fan-service. This was a really pleasant surprise and a nicechange from all those fan service-loaded games that take themselves way too seriously.To encounter a game that is self-aware and derisive about its own propensityfor fan-service is quite refreshing and should definitely be a more frequentoccurrence. —The gamedoes look very good with the 3D on. In fact, this is the only 3ds game I ever playedwith the 3D enabled. Not only does it look great and sharp without ever hurtingthe eyes, but it also facilitates the gameplay by giving you a better view ofwhere the enemies stand. This is by no means necessary, but it definitelyhelps. —Replayingthe main quest is much more pleasant the second time around, when yourcharacter is conveniently leveled up. You can then slash your way throughenemies, bask in your own strength and luxuriate in smooth fights where youalways have the upper hand. It’s a pity that you have to trudge through atedious first playthrough littered with forced level-grinding and messy fightsto reach such sleek mastery, but it’s definitely worth it. —The lastboss battle is amazing. The game lets you fight one-on-one at last, in agorgeous setting to boot. This ultimate fight is neatly balanced, involvingstrategy, sharp reflexes and the use of all your abilities, and is a sheer joyto play. It doesn’t make you forget all the other messy and irksome bossbattles, but it allows you to clear the game on a very positive note. —Thesoundtrack is a feast to the ears. From the gorgeous Sailor Moon-like theme thataccompanies most battles to this amazing Mexican-sounding acoustic guitar trackthat unfortunately plays way too rarely, without forgetting the ludicrous andhilarious shop theme, all the songs in Code of Princess are pure ear-candy.  So, here weare. When all is said and done, Code ofPrincess is not a horrible game: it can actually be quite enjoyable attimes and offers some really pleasant features. It’s only disappointing torealize that it could have been a much, much better game with the right amountof effort and gusto. Now, would I recommend purchasing this game at full price?Absolutely not. I paid my own copy 30$, and it definitely feels too expensivefor that game now that I’ve played it. This is a game that would have been morefitted for a digital release, for it lacks the depth and polish of mostphysically released titles and has decidedly shoddy looks that are morereminiscent of an indie or a flash game than of a boxed one. (As a matter offact, it was released in Europe and Australia as a downloadable-only title,which fits its nature and content quite aptly.) Still, and despite all myranting about Code of Princess, I will probably play it againin a distant future, especially now that I’ve soldiered through its flaws andreached a relative amount of mastery. As for now, thanks for reading, and be myguest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon-Gates to Infinity: That's the way I like it", "date": "07/03/2014", "text": "That’s it.This time, they nailed it right. Joy and glory! Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity, developed by Spike Chunsoft andpublished by Nintendo in 2012(ja) and 2013(na/eu/aus) for the 3ds, is the lastestentry of the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series, and gloriously surpasses its predecessors invirtually every field. Basically, it’s like Chunsoft heard my pleas about Blue Rescue Team before I even utteredthem and improved everything accordingly. More likely, they got massive feedbackfrom people who were irritated by the same flaws as I was, and finally decidedto get their act together and try to make a great game instead of an averageone. Maybe the merger with Spike also helped, bringing fresh blood, brain cellsand insight into the fold. At any rate, they managed todo an amazing job with this entry: Gatesto Infinity is aglorious quantum leap in the right direction and a little gem of a game. However,it’s worth noting that the reviews for that game were far from being glorious. Gates to Infinity actually got lower rankings than Blue Rescue Team on Gamerankings and Metacritic, which is quiteunfathomable to me. I can only imagine that most reviewers are getting tired ofthe series after having tried and tested all the very similar DS episodes—heck,maybe I would also be bored to death if I had played them all. But my instincttold me to purchase that game anyway, and since I usually refuse to be swayedby reviews, either good or bad, I followed my guts and got a copy. And boy,don’t I regret doing that!So, makeroom for the praise! Gates to Infinityis an amazing game, much better than its older brother Blue Rescue Team, and here’s why. The GoodLet’s startwith one of the points that disappointed me the most in Blue Rescue Team, namely the level design. It would be a lie to saythat Gates offers a complete overhaulin the matter, since the core of the level design remains identical to what ithas been throughout the whole series: dungeons are still made of rooms ofvarious sizes connected by narrow corridors. But this time, Spike Chunsoftstepped out of their lazy stupor and introduced a handful of welcomed improvementsthat make the dungeon design much more palatable, and even enjoyable to someextent. Not so much of an overhaul then, but rather a brilliant and inspiredmakeover.First, therooms are not always square anymore, and come in a pleasant variety of sizesand shapes. Second, the corridors are not always desperately straight; theyactually have some curves and bends of sorts. Third, and most importantly, thedungeons actually do resemble what they are supposed to be: forests look likeforests, caves look like caves, glaciers look like glaciers, and so on. Everydungeon is generously sprinkled with scenery elements such as flowers, rocks, pondsof shimmering water, fallen leaves, ice crystals, shadows from passing cloudsand other natural beauties that liven up the design and make the dungeoncrawling seem and feel like a splendid excursion in the wild. Granted, it’sstill a bit of a repetitive design at its core, but it looks and feels tentimes better than the lazy design of BlueRescue Team. The dungeons also dolook wildly different from one another in Gates,which gives a great incentive to progress and discover new ones. I found myselfreally curious to find out what the next dungeon would look like up until thevery end of my playthrough; gone is the implacable boredom born from thenauseating experience of trudging endlessly through barely distinct dungeons. Alsogone is the feeling of claustrophobia that BlueRescue Team could stir in the player prone to it: this time around, thanksto a better camera angle, the dungeon crawling doesn’t feel oppressive evenafter a lot of time spent in dungeons.  The Very GoodLet’s moveon to the worst flaw of the original game: the graphics, folks. Those bland,dull, boring and uninspired graphics that were an absolute insult to the DS.Well this time, it’s fair to say that this department went through a completeand massive overhaul, and an outstanding one at that. The graphics in Gates are pure, sheer and deliciouseye-candy that fully and gloriously exploits the 3ds capabilities. I mentionedin my last post that these graphics alone provided me an incentive to purchasethe game and could single-handedly make me enjoy it even if everything elseremained virtually untouched. I was actually blessed beyond my wildest dreams,for everything else was also vastly amended and bettered; but that doesn’tdiminish the excellent merits of these gorgeous graphics. The colours arevivid, shiny and vibrant (much more so than in my crappy pictures, trust me)and the textures are detailed and lovingly smooth, all the while remaininghighly stylized and avoiding the trap of boring extra-realism that so many gamesfall prey to these days. As I mentioned before, I am by no means the type ofgamer who thinks that graphics are the most important point in a game and comefirst and foremost, but I still know how to enjoy great graphics when Iencounter them, and the graphics in Gatesdefinitely fall into that category. They are an absolute delight to the eyes, asoothing caress to the retina, a brilliant and lovely treat that demands to beenjoyed to the fullest. The ExcellentHere comethe last and most massive point, and that is the gameplay. It was actually themost decent and capable department of BlueRescue Team and the one that needed the least to be improved; and yet SpikeChunsoft, instead of simply resting on their laurels and churning out the sameold tried-and-tested formula, actually managed the tour de force of improving the gameplay in virtually every possibleway. First, themenu system is much better. It was already quite fine in the original, but theybeautifully refined it in Gates: it’sintuitive, clear, and an absolute joy to use. There has also been a seriousincrease in terms of the variety of items available, which come now in dozensof variations; yet this abundance doesn’t feel overwhelming, for each item hasa precise, clear and one-dimensional purpose. None of them feel useless, asthey can each have an interesting purpose depending on the circumstances, andsome of them are just vital if you want to travel safely through the dungeons. Thewhole aspect of elemental combinations and matches, which had somehow remaineda mystery to me in Blue Rescue Team,is much clearer and easy to figure out this time around. I quickly noticed thatsome moves had to be avoided around some Pokemons, which introduced aninteresting amount of strategizing in the fighting process. It’s no tacticalRPG by any mean and remains basic, granted, but it’s still pleasant.Therecruitment, which was so hard in BlueRescue Team, has become a total breeze in Gates. I was not especially keen on recruiting, since I wasbasically happy with the partners given by the game; and yet, I ended up with ateam of 30-or-so Pokemons without even trying. It’s worth noting, though, thatthe recruiting process is easy only in the early stages of the game: as youreach harder dungeons, the resident Pokemon will be less inclined to join youand you’ll have to resort to tailor-made gifts, available in a certain store,to woo and recruit them. Another very neat aspect linked to recruitment is thefact that you don’t need to level up each Pokemon individually anymore: theexperience you earn by winning battles benefits every single Pokemon in yourteam, even the ones that are safely waiting for you at home. This is abrand-new feature that can also be found in PokemonX and Y, the latest entries ofthe Pokemon series, and it’sbasically the supreme gift to the player who hates grinding. Some criticizedthis new development, arguing that it took away a part of the challenge inherent to Pokemon games by making the leveling up process way too easy. I disagree with that, frankly. I love grinding asmuch as the next RPG aficionado, but the idea of having to level up each one of yourhundreds of Pokemons individually feels more like a refined punishment than anenjoyable process to me. Having to do so is not especially challenging to startwith, if you look at it closely: it’s more time-consuming than anything else, andcan only be tolerated out of an unconditional love for the franchise—or becauseyou’re a kid and thus enjoy repetitive things, have loads of free time on yourhands, and want to brag about your over-powered ‘Mons. But I’m no kid anymore,and my time is precious; and thus I love this feature that allows me to save manyhours and spend more time enjoying more meaningful things, like crawlingthrough dungeons in order to progress the story. Talkingabout the story, it’s a pretty good one, shall I say. It still starts the sameway as in every single game of the series, with you waking up one day in aPokemon’s body and trying to figure out why this happened. But this time, youcan actually choose which Pokemon you will play as. Hooray! Granted, there isnot a huge choice in the matter; but you can choose, and that’s lovely. Sobeing still unsavvy in all things Pokemon, I of course chose Pikachu. Whatelse?  I unceremoniously nicknamed him“Pika” and dove into the story, which turned out to be much better than Iexpected. The characters each have their own distinct personalities and arewell fleshed-out, and I got attached to them without realizing it. Thestoryline has a fair number of twists and turns and is much deeper that whatone would expect from a Pokemon game. It may look like kiddy stuff at first,pulled straight from a cartoon series; but as you progress through the game,deeper concepts with a distinct Buddhist flavour suddenly take shape, alongwith a more serious and mature tone. This is really an interesting developmentand one that should satisfy even adults—at least, it did satisfy me. A lot hasbeen said about the overabundance of text, and I really expected the worst,especially since I hate babbling galore in games; but to my surprise, it wasperfectly tolerable. Sure, there is much more talking and cutscenes than in Blue Rescue Team, but it’s still prettytame compared to some JRPGs (I’m glaring at you, Tales of the Abyss).  As for thedungeon crawling, it’s just pure, unaltered pleasure. This time, Spike Chunsoftmade sure to also cater to the crew that came here primarily for the dungeoncrawling, and boy did they do that splendidly! Gates is full to the brim with juicy, delicious treats that shouldsatisfy the gourmet palate of every dungeon crawler lover—provided that theyare open-minded and don’t sniff at the relative easiness of the game tostart with. First, and to get this out of the way, exploring the dungeons is ofcourse pleasurable thanks to the great graphics and various designs, but it’sfortunately not the only reason. The soundtrack also plays a huge part inmaking this dungeon crawling a pure pleasure: it’s simply drop-dead gorgeous.In fact, it’s one of the most beautiful soundtracks I’ve ever heard in a game,period. The themes are complex and intricate, borrowing from numerous musicalinfluences and mixing them expertly, and creating a wide range of moods andatmospheres, from happy and relaxed to intense and dramatic. On top of that,there are plenty of them. What else could you ask for, seriously?Now thatwe’ve established that the dungeon crawling in Gates is a feast for the senses, let’s expose the practical aspectsof it. The most obvious change from the DS games is the removal of the hungerfactor: no longer do you need to feed your Pokemon regularly with apples andjellies to prevent them from fainting. While some blamed this removal formaking the game way too easy, it can also be seen under a positive light: youcan now explore the dungeons to the fullest, without having to worry aboutrunning out of energy or food. Given that the whole hunger feature wasuncomfortably close to fake difficulty to start with, I’m not quite sure thisis such a great loss. The dungeons still present others interesting challenges,like the classic monster houses, the unlockable rooms containing rare items andover-powered enemies or the sudden weather changes that will gradually damageyour health and prevent you from recovering it. Gates offer a great variety of dungeons in thestoryline alone, but there is much more than that to the game. For theinsatiable dungeon crawler addict is a tailor-made feature called “Magnagates”.To put it simply, taking a picture of any circular object, like a glass, willgenerate an exclusive random dungeon that will have to be cleared with a randomPokemon. Of course, these dungeons are full of items and money, and recruitmentis possible while exploring them. Once you clear one, every item you collectedis handed over to your main party and freshly recruited partners are added toyour roster of ‘Mons. This, added to the thrill of discovering new dungeonswith specific styles and features, makes these Magnagates an absolute thrill anda delight of a feature for dungeon crawling lovers. The number of possibledungeons seems to be virtually limitless, or at least pretty massive, with thevery title of the game hinting at this enormous array of potentialities. Along withthis delicious Magnagate feature comes another interesting one called“Companion Mode”. It allows you to take control of another Pokemon for yourroster and lead them through sidequests in order to collect various items. Thistakes place in parallel with the main quest, your progression in the storylineremaining untouched, and works just like the Magnagates, with any collecteditems given to your party and newly recruited Pokemon added to your roster.This is a very pleasant diversion from the main quest and a great opportunityto create completely different teams and control any Pokemon of your choice.Even better than that, it can actually save you when you’re in a bind: let’ssay you are stuck in a dungeon and run out of a crucial item (this can happen,especially in the latter part of the game). You can be brave and go on withoutit, if such is your desire; but you can also switch to Companion Mode and havea Pokemon from your roster collect the much-needed item for you, either bypurchasing it or tackling a few sidequests. Lackeys are so very handy, indeed!(Even though it’s still you playing in the end. Oh, well.)So what wehave here is basically a much more balanced game, in which dungeon crawling aficionadoscan get their fill as well as Pokemon adepts. This balance is exactly what wasmissing from Blue Rescue Team, whichwas as weak as it could be on the dungeon crawling side, and to find itrestored here is a pure joy. No more dead-boring dungeon crawling in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon! The balance is restored, and the universeis finally getting the great dungeon crawler it rightly deserved! We need more,much more of these, o yes indeed. Well, well.This post turned out to be much longer than I expected. Guess I can’t help it:it seems that every time I really love a game, I feel compelled to elaborate onit and praise it endlessly. But that’s enough for now, I think. Let’s call itquit! These were my very warm feelings about Gates to Infinity. Myonly hope now is that any potential installment to come will follow thisbrilliant new formula. As for now, thanks for reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon-Blue Rescue Team: Decent gameplay, bad everything else", "date": "25/02/2014", "text": "It’s alwayssad to see a game with great potential somehow miss the mark and end up asbarely average. Pokemon Mystery Dungeon:Blue Rescue Team unfortunately falls into that category in my book: it’s agame that could have been awesome, had it not been hampered and dragged down bya slew of issues too glaring to be ignored. But first,let’s expose the genesis of that game. The MysteryDungeon series, known as Fushigi NoDungeon in Japan where it originated,is indeed an interesting one. Created by Chunsoft in 1993, it’s a series ofroguelike games based on the exploration of randomly generated dungeons andfeaturing a tweaked turn-based battle system, in which enemies make a moveevery time the player makes one. Nothing too original here, but the seriesdistinguishes itself from other roguelikes by pairing this dungeon crawlingwith characters from well-known RPG franchises that virtually have nothing todo with the roguelike genre, thus creating interesting cross-overs featuringfamiliar characters thrown in unfamiliar settings. So far, the series has beenmeddling with Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy and of course Pokemon. (There is alsoa sub-series featuring an original character called Shiren the Wanderer, which I will cover in a future post.)Blue Rescue Team is the very first game of the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon sub-series. Itwas developed by Chunsoft and published by Nintendo in 2005(jp) and 2006(na,aus, eu) for the Nintendo DS. A companion game called Red Rescue Team was released for the Gameboy Advance at the sametime, and ironically, it managed to garner better reviews than the DS version,despite being on an older system. That’s not to say that the DS version was panned:it was actually rather well received, both by critics and players. So much so,in fact, that it spawned three sequels, turning thus into a full-blown seriesthat lasted the lifetime of the DS and continued to the next generation ofhandhelds by making the jump to the 3ds with its latest installment, Gates to Infinity. When Ipicked up that game, I had a very clear idea of what I wanted. I expected asimple and straightforward dungeon crawler with a bit of cutesy thanks to thePokemon factor. I have never played a Pokemon game in my whole life, but I knewthe basics of the series’ gameplay enough to anticipate interesting battle mechanicsbased on clever elemental combinations. At any rate, I expected a mellow andeasygoing game, lounging somewhere at the relaxed end of the dungeon crawlerspectrum. What I gotinstead was a half-hearted attempt at roguelike dungeon crawling that oozed laziness through every pixel and thus ended up as a complete underachievement.Like I said, this game could have been great, had the right amount of gusto andpassion been put into its development; instead, it’s barely average, and here’swhy.The GoodFirst,let’s dive into the gameplay. It’s quite competent, and turns out to be thebest-handled part of the game. BlueRescue Team features the tweaked turn-based battle system present in all Mystery Dungeon games, in which enemiesmake a move every time you make one. Fights take place directly on the field,on a grid similar to a chess board. You have the choice between four differentmoves during battles, and items can also be used. New moves can be learnedduring the course of the game as you level up, or purchased in a dedicatedstore for a consequent amount of money. The interesting elemental combinationsI expected were present, but their underlying mechanics were absolutely notexplained in any way during the game, which was a real downside for a beginnerlike me. I guess Blue Rescue Team wasprimarily aimed at hardcore Pokemon fans who played the classical games andalready knew everything about elemental combinations; but still, it would havebeen nice to include a small tutorial for the beginners who came here primarilyfor the dungeon crawling side. We were probably not a huge crew, granted, butthat would have been lovely. Instead of that, the player unsavvy in all thingsPokemon is left grasping at straws and more often than not ends up using movesrandomly, which is slightly frustrating. Of course,as you might expect from a Pokemon spin-off, there is a recruiting side to thegame: hostile Pokemons may suddenly turn over a new leaf and decide to join youand do good deeds by your side instead of wandering aimlessly through darkcaves. But recruitment is not an easy affair: those nasty Pokemons you meet arenot exactly in a hurry to join your team, and it takes a good number of fightsto recruit any of them, especially knowing that the prerequisite condition tohave a Pokemon joining your team is to have the last blow of the fight fired bythe very Pokemon you control. There are 386 Pokemons available for recruitmentin Blue Rescue Team, and my head iswhirling just thinking of how long it might take to get them all. Talk about hardcorecompletion.The storyfeels mainly like an excuse for the dungeon crawling, which is perfectly fine.You are a human who wakes up one day in the Pokemon world, transformed into aPokemon, and set off to investigate the whole matter, along with a stickypartner who somehow trusted you at first sight and decided to follow you to theend of the world. Oh, well. Classical RPG fare, shall we say. Being a Pokemonnovice, I wanted to go with Pikachu, since this is the only Pokemon I know; butyou don’t get to choose the Pokemon you play as in that game. Instead, you fillin a quiz with seemingly random questions and the game chooses for you. I thusended up with Eevee, a cute little fox-like creature, and Pikachu as my partnerin crime. Menus areglobally well designed, even though the way they operate is sometimes slightlypuzzling. There is a pleasant variety of items to use during your dungeoncrawling, and you are definitely encouraged to spend them rather than shelvethem, since you can always get more at the village shops. The game doesn’tpunish you too severely when you get stranded into a game over: instead ofrestarting from level 1 like in the Shiren the Wanderer sub-series, you warpback to the Pokemon village with half of your items and money gone, but allyour experience intact, and can tackle the dungeon again after refurbishing. Thedungeon crawling includes a hunger factor, designed to keep you on your toes:as you walk around and fight, your Pokemon will get hungrier, up to the pointwhere you will have to feed them apples and jellies to replenish them. I haveto admit that this gameplay element rubbed me the wrong way: I saw it as ahidden encouragement to clear dungeons as fast as possible, which clashed withmy own habit of exploring floors to the fullest and leaving no stone unturned.Oh, well. This was a minor annoyance, not a deal-breaker, especially since Ididn’t really feel like exploring dungeons to the fullest in that game to startwith. But more on that latter.Let’s faceit, the gameplay is very repetitive. Your set of four moves gets old reallyfast, and renewing them involves some grinding, either to level up and get tothe point where you can learn new moves or to get the money to buy them. Thegame, as a whole, is quite grindy: everything requires a healthy amount ofgrinding, from leveling up to recruiting allies, and that induces a lot ofrepetitiveness. Still, when all is said and done, the gameplay manages to besatisfactory. Everything works smoothly and is well implemented, and with theright amount of grinding, there is a lot of depth to be found in Blue Rescue Team. The BadThingsstart growing stale when one pores over other aspects of the game. Like, say,the dungeon design: laziness is strong with this one, o yes indeed. Dungeons inBlue Rescue Team are randomlygenerated, which virtually eliminates any cleverness in the design to startwith. But this is a staple of dungeon crawling, after all: it’s a genre thatcelebrates repetition and strives not on clever level design, but rather on theslightly obsessive process of clearing one similar-looking floor after theother and emerging alive from the whole ordeal. Still, even in dungeoncrawlers, there is good repetitive level design, and there is bad repetitivelevel design; and the level design in BlueRescue Team clearly falls into the last category.It’s a bad leveldesign primarily because it lacks variety. It only features two basic layoutelements: corridors of various lengths and square rooms of various sizes.Nothing else. No round shapes, no curvy lanes, just a pile of square roomsconnected by narrow alleyways. This level design makes dungeons look likesmazes, which is absolutely not coherent with the setting of the whole game tostart with: here is a game that is supposedly taking place in a naturalenvironment, with forests, mountains, canyons and so on, and yet featuresdungeons looking like underground mazes or castle floors. This is veryunsatisfying, and even more so as you progress through the game and discoverthat this uninspired level design repeats itself in every single dungeon, withonly color palette swaps to mark the difference between one dungeon and thenext. This kills the pleasure and excitement of discovering a new dungeon andleaves you with very little incentive to go on and progress through the game,as far as level design is concerned. Not only that, but this level design canalso elicit a feeling of claustrophobia if you happen to be prone to it. I swearthat every time I played Blue Rescue Team, I started feeling ill at ease andstressed after spending some time in a dungeon—which is quite unfortunate,since there is nothing to do in that game but trudge through dungeons. The UglyHere comesthe deal-breaker, the last straw that made me throw up my hands in frustration andshove my Blue Rescue Team cartridgeback in its box. The graphics, ladies and gentlemen. The graphics in that gameare the ultimate display of laziness from the developers, and a supreme insultto the DS capabilities. These graphics are not bad per se, mind you. Bad graphics are graphics that hinder thegameplay or try to pierce your retina with their massive pixels, and that isnot the case in Blue Rescue Team. Theproblem here is that the graphics are over-simplistic, and absolutely not onpar with what the DS can produce. This stems mostly from the fact that the gamewas designed for both the DS and the Gameboy Advance, with the last used as thereference point: instead of creating two distinct versions adapted to theirrespective systems, Chunsoft played it lazy by downgrading everything toGameboy Advance level and creating only one game, released under two differentnames with a few minor tweaks between the two versions. This is seriouslydisappointing, especially knowing what the DS was capable of, even in theseearly stages of its lifetime: the very same year saw the release of Children of Mana, an action-baseddungeon crawler with splendid and luscious graphics that could make Blue Rescue Team crawl away in shame. I said thatthese graphics were the deal-breaker for me, but it’s a tad more complex thanthat. I started gaming in the late 80’s, and as an 8-bit era veteran, I neverconsidered simple graphics to be an issue or a deterrent of any sort whengaming is concerned; it takes much more than primitive graphics to make me giveup on a game. But Blue Rescue Team isnot just any game: it’s a dungeon crawler. And now is the time to introduce mypersonal theorem regarding dungeon crawlers, which goes as such: if youconsider the three main elements that are gameplay, level design and graphics,I can gladly tolerate high repetitiveness and general mediocrity in two ofthese fields if the third manages to be top-class. Thus, I can stomach boringlevel design and shitty graphics if the gameplay is great, or endure repetitivegameplay and crappy level design if they come along with beautiful graphics,and so on—you get the idea. And unfortunately, Blue Rescue Team fails to fulfill that theorem. The gameplay isdecent, granted, but still not good enough to compensate for the uninspiredlevel design and horribly bland graphics. I called the graphics a deal-breakerbecause they are the most visible and potent failure, but it’s really the lackof greatness in any of the three aforementioned fields that ruined the game inmy eyes and made me give up on it after only a couple of hours, much to mydismay. So here Iam, left with an unfinished game and a lot of frustrations. Dungeon crawlersare painfully scarce in the West, and here was the promise of not only one gamebelonging to the genre, but a full series: this seemed like a dream come true!Alas, that dream was not meant to be, and that beautiful promise turned sour,due to an obvious lack of commitment and dedication on the developers’ part. This game feels like a missed opportunity, ashadow of what it could have been, and this is SO disappointing. I’m justrelieved that I didn’t buy the full series on a whim, or the disappointmentwould have been ever more massive: from what I know, the formula was leftunchanged in the subsequent DS releases, with Chunsoft not bothering to improvethe graphics or the level design even though they were now working on the DSonly. Oh, well. Still, as Aragornbeautifully states in The Two Towers,“there is always hope”. I stumbled lately on screen captures from the latestinstallment of the series, Gates toInfinity, and was transfixed by their sheer eye-candy quality. This alone wouldmake that game fulfill my dungeon crawler theorem, which means that I could enjoyit! I thus decided to give it a try in the near future and see if the seriescan redeem itself in my eyes. As for now, thanks for reading, and be my guestanytime!"},
{"title": "Final Fantasy Fables-Chocobo Tales: Cute casualness galore", "date": "17/02/2014", "text": "Cute, cute,cute. This game is just SO cute. It’s the gaming incarnation of cuteness,period. But cuteness is only skin-deep, so they say; and this game seems tosomehow know that. Not only is it cute to a fault, but it’s also clever, andmuch deeper than one could think at first. Let’s take a look at it. Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales, developed by h.a.n.d. andpublished by Square Enix for the Nintendo DS in 2006(jp) and 2007(na, aus, eu),is a game which I would describe as “cleverly casual”. It features thewell-known mascot from the Final Fantasyseries, the bright yellow bird Chocobo, in a collection of mini-games creativelyglued together into a whimsical story, all peppered with a healthy dose offan-service for good measure.  Chocobo Tales brilliantly showcases the expertise and talentof Square Enix. This is indeed a developer that can create amazing games whenthey put their mind to it, even though their last home console offerings mademany a gamer ponder whether or not they had lost their mojo. Chocobo Tales ismasterfully refined from beginning to end, offering splendid graphics,beautiful musical themes and rock-solid gameplay. Casual it may be, but it’s sopolished you can see yourself in it.Let’s diveinto the gameplay. The core of the game is the Story Mode, which feature asimple yet fanciful story involving a set of sixteen picture books scatteredaround the world by a malevolent spirit which you have—of course—to defeat. Theminigames come into the picture by being contained in the pictures books, andeach minigame boasts a handful of requirements which must be cleared toadvance the story. Boss battles feature a card-based fighting system straightfrom the 90’s, using cards that can be collected in various ways through thegame world. To complete the picture, the game also contains some so-called“microgames”, which are side dishes of sorts with the sole purpose of lettingyou earn cards. It would be tedious and pointless to expose every single detailof the gameplay, but suffice it to say that the game bristles with interestingfeatures that all interconnect in a very imaginative way. The game also offersa more casual mode which allows you to jump straight to the minigames andmicrogames, but only after you uncover them in the Story Mode. The minigamesare ingenious, original, and as a whole incredibly amusing and entertaining.They are also incredibly picturesque, featuring a beautiful hand-drawn style thatmakes for pure eye-candy and an even more delightful experience. I tend to disregardand disdain all things casual, and yet I enjoyed myself immensely while playingChocobo Tales and its glorious cohortof minigames. It’s worth exposing the raw nature of the said cohort, though,for the sake of any potential player: these minigames are virtually all basedon a merciless combination of speed, good timing and precision, and they allrequire good motor skills and sharp reflexes; all that peppered with a luckfactor too important to be overlooked. Prepare so for multiples tries, shouldyou tackle that game, especially if your reflexes and motor skills are poor.Still, the challenges posed by these minigames are by no means impossible tomeet: this is a game primarily aimed at children, after all, and they wouldn’tmake it too brutally hard. I’m far from being brilliant when it comes to motorskills and reflexes, and yet I managed to clear the game without any majordifficulty. (I was only seriously stuck once, but I suspect it had more to dowith the nature of the minigame involved: it was a race game, and I’ve not playeda race game since Sonic Drift Racing 2on the Game Gear. So I’m quite, herm,out of practice.) In fact, I came to consider Chocobo Tales as some kind of welcomed brain-training which allowedme to dust off my rusted reflexes—and boy, was it funnier than Dr Kawashima’s. Themicrogames are much simpler affairs, and unlike the minigames, they remainentirely optional. They feature stripped-down graphics, on par with what aGameboy Advance could offer, and basic gameplay based on poking, collectingitems and other simple, one-dimensional ideas. Still, they are no lessentertaining and can actually be quite challenging despite their apparentsimplicity. Depending on your score, you can earn two different cards; but the “gold”ranking, required to get the most precious card of the pair, is just insanelyhard to attain. I managed to get it only once, and that was in a microgamebased on sheer luck, so no kudos deserved here. Interestingly, some microgames emulatethe 16-bit era gaming style, both in visuals and audio; these are absolute Proust’smadeleines for older gamers, delicious treats for veterans to enjoy.The cardbattles, which go under the name of “Pop-up Duels”, are a completely differentaffair, and a thrilling change in style and mechanics. They are a brilliant mixof strategy and luck unfolding as follows: you first have to choose a limitednumber of cards to bring into a duel (first 8, then 15 later in the game);then, at every turn, three of these cards are randomly selected and you have tochoose which one you want to use. You don’t get to see your opponent’s cards,and that’s where the luck factor comes into the picture: good or bad matchingof the cards can dramatically alter the outcome of a turn—and even of a duel,for that matter—may it be in your favour or not. There are also a lot ofstrategies involved, and the whole system is much deeper than it may seem atfirst sight. Once again, there is a timing notion there: the first to select acard get to attack first in the upcoming turn, which can also change the said turn’soutcome completely. This keeps you on your toes and forces you to think fast,adding some sense of thrill and excitement to the picture. Top this with dynamicanimations showcasing a gorgeous hand-drawn style similar to the one used inthe minigames, and you have a total winner of a game feature. These card battleswere definitely my favourite part of the game, and I just couldn’t wait to facebosses to play them. I loved the sense of urgency and the fast, relentlesspace, all the while rejoicing in the absence of any high motor skillrequirement. And the satisfaction of picking up the card best fitted for oneturn, when strategy met luck in a perfect matching, was just priceless. I haveto admit that I performed fist pumps more than once during these phases, notleast when a particularly intense duel finally came to an end after many atwist. As you mayexpect from this kind of game, there is a strong emphasis on completion invarious fields: Cards collection, minigames requirements, and other points Ididn’t mention here. Since I’m not a completist at heart, I just went on withthe flow and focused mostly on clearing the game, but there is definitelyplenty of material here for the pleasure of the dedicated completist. Out ofcuriosity, I tried browsing the internet to find out if there were any rewardstied to a 100% completion in one field or in all of them, but I couldn’t findany relevant information. Oh, well. I guess the pleasure of achieving 100%completion is a reward in itself for the hardcore completist. All in all,this is a great game, heavy in content and deeply entertaining. I clocked onlyten hours at the end of my playthrough, but those were ten dense and busyhours, full of delight and enjoyment. Coming from a person who shies away fromanything casual, this is testimony to the sheer quality of Chocobo Tales. Cherry on the cake, it can be purchased for a verycheap price nowadays. That’s allfor Chocobo Tales, folks. A fine gameit is, indeed, and top-class in its field. Thanks for reading, and be my guestanytime!"},
{"title": "Lifesigns: Poking and probing your way through internship", "date": "01/02/2014", "text": "Every oncein a while, between a hardcore dungeon crawler and a 70-hours long JRPG, I liketo take a breath and relax by tackling a point-and click adventure game. Thisis actually my second favourite genre after the Holy Realm of RPG, and my tastein the matter is quite broad: I eagerly lap every point-and-click installmentthat comes my way, from cosy and laid-back affairs like Professor Layton toviciously twisted puzzlers like Myst. Lifesignsfalls more on the relaxed end of the spectrum. Developed by Spike and releasedin 2005(jp), 2007(na) and 2008(eu), this rather innocent DS game is the perfectbreather between two intense RPG playthroughs. It is actually the direct sequelto a game called Kenshuui Tendō Dokuta; as you may guess from the title, this first installment was released only inJapan, which makes the decision to release the second one worldwide a bitpuzzling, especially since the story picks up directly from where it stopped atthe end of the first game. Localization’s ways are sometimes mysterious,indeed.  Anyway,this second installment follows the rocky second year of hospital internship ofDr Tendo, a young aspirant surgeon who finds himself entangled on a regular basic in all sorts of troubles and affairs—which often includes health issues, as one may expect. Yet surprisingly,there is much more talking than operating in that game. It tends to focus moreon the relationships between the characters, the gossip about them and thequirky, funny or dramatic situations that unfold around them, all this treatedin a very mundane and down-to-earth way. Think Scrubs rather than ER—albeita very distinctively Japanese version of Scrubs.Lifesigns is actually pretty much the antithesis of the major surgical game series,the more famous Trauma Center. Does thatmean that this game is a dull, boring affair? Well, no. While Lifesigns is byno mean one of the best titles on the DS, it’s also far from being one of theworst. It’s actually fairly average in all departments: from the generic, seen-a-million-times-beforeanime art style to the omnipresent elevator music, nothing shines or stands outto blow your mind. Yet, nothing is broken either, and the game manages to offera solid and rather smooth experience, if not a tremendously original one. Lifesigns’sfocus is most definitely centered on its storyline. Sure, you get to cut a fewpatients open; but let’s face it, you spend much, much more time runningthrough the hospital and talking with every person you encounter in order tomake the story progress. A story that actually manages to be quiteentertaining, juggling effortlessly between tense, emotional and light-heartedmoments. The game is divided in five episodes, each of them offering threedifferent outcomes, and leading all in all to four different endings; this addssome interesting replay value to a title which would otherwise have verylittle. As for the characters, they are quite lively, quirky and entertaining,and manage to avoid being complete anime clichés. By the end of the game, I hadactually grown quite fond of them, and I certainly won’t mind meeting themagain for another playthrough of Lifesigns. That is, in a few months or years,when I’ve forgotten most of it. I wouldlike to talk at length about the gameplay; but this is a point-and-click gameafter all, and a rather simple one at that, and there is really not much totalk about. As in many point-and-click games, you interact with people andobjects by poking and prodding them, and watch as the story progresses andunfolds quietly through such interactions. The operations are more fast-pacedaffairs, requiring good timing and precision; yet, they are far from being astricky as the ones featured in the TraumaCenter series, and failing them is more likely to be due to the occasionallack of accuracy of the touch screen than to some inherent difficulty of theirs.It’s worth noting that failing an operation will grant you an immediate GameOver; but since the game always gives you the option to save before anyoperation, there is hardly any risk of losing your progress. There is, however,another Game Over occurrence in which you can lose a subsequent amount of yourprogression, and that takes place during a phase called “Convince”. This issome kind of minigame which must be cleared to advance the story: it requiresyou to convince a character to act a certain way by feeding them some specificpieces of data stored in your inventory (called “medical record”, for the sakeof the hospital setting). These specific pieces of data must be presented in aspecific sequence to achieve persuasion and clear the minigame; deviate toomuch from this sequence, or select the wrong pieces of data to start with, andthe game will shove a Game Over in your face. Better make sure to save when youfeel a Convince occurrence coming your way, if you don’t want to lose thirtyminutes of your progression like I did once after I failed to Convince someone. There is aromance side to the game, but it would be absolutely far-fetched to describe Lifesigns as something even remotelyakin to a romance sim. You can’t actively woo a potential love interest, andspeaking to them as often as you can doesn’t seem to do the trick either. Infact, the requirements needed to end up dating a specific lady are murky atbest, and seem to depend more on decisions made at some points in the storythan on any active romancing on your part. I had my eye on Aoshima-san, myfunny fellow intern obsessed with food, and tried to interact with her as muchas I could during the game in the hope of finally dating her; and yet, for someunfathomable reason, I ended up instead dating Kurai-san, the weird operationroom nurse with a creepy laugh. Oh, well. I’ll try to do things differentlynext time, and see who it will turn out. The onlything that really frustrated me in Lifesigns was the fact that many issuesremain unresolved when the credits finally roll. The game ends up in a very open way, leaving a handful ofimportant matters unaddressed, especially regarding relationships and otherpossibly more sinister plots hidden between closed hospital doors. This wasvery likely intentional, and was probably designed to pave the way for a thirdinstallment of the series. Alas, this hypothetical third installment was neverreleased, neither in Japan nor anywhere else; and after so many years, there isvery little chance that it will see the light of day. This lack of closure,combined to the fact that Lifesigns is the continuation of an ongoing story, gaveme the vexing feeling of having caught a soap opera on the fly and watched ahandful of episodes before it was abruptly cancelled, just when I was starting to get interested. Talk about disappointment. Despite this,I would still recommend Lifesigns to any fan of point-and-click games. Thegenre’s popularity and representation is not exactly at its peak right now, andit would be a pity to pass on one of its members, especially since the DS andits touch screen are so, so perfectly tailored for point-and-click galore.Given that nowadays, you can get your hands on a copy of that game for just a handful ofdollars, pounds, euros or whatever your currency is, there’s definitely noreason not to indulge in a bit of poking, probing, nipping and tucking. Thanksfor reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Avalon Code (3): THAT plot twist (with massive chunks of SPOILERS!)", "date": "29/01/2014", "text": "Before we start, be warned: this post isbasically one huge spoiler. If you ever intend to play Avalon Code, avert youreyes, lest the impact of the most intense event of the story be entirelyruined. That being said, on with the show!Well, well, well. THAT Plot Twist. That soul-wrenching,nerve-wracking Plot Twist. That Mother of all plot twists, which makes yourhead reel and your heart break. I definitely couldn’t avoid talking at lengthabout the plot twist that shocked me the most since the one in Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening onGame Boy, twenty years ago. Plot twists are not uncommon in RPGs, andI’ve seen my fair share of them over the years. I can’t even say this one tookme by surprise: as a matter of fact, I saw it coming from afar. When Chapter 5started, with the Tournament looming in the horizon, I knew we had a plot twist coming. Call it experience, or intuition,but I was absolutely certain something would happen at the end of that fatedTournament. But despite being so sure and trying to guess what could be instore, I certainly didn’t expect that.Not in a million years. This plot twist is astonishing in more ways than one,and here’s why.Too much of a bad thingStory-wise, what happens in Avalon Code's god-forsakenplot twist is not really that original. I mentioned the plot twist of Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening earlier,which actually happens to be a highly original one; but I would be hard-pressedto find the same amount of sheer originality in Avalon Code’s plot twist events.Everything that happens in the course of that plot twist has been seen beforein other RPGs, sometimes much more than once. Let’s review it all: —Your best friend makes an alliance withthe enemy, backstabbing you in the process? We’ve totally seen this before. —Your lover is ripped away from your lovingarms and left for dead? We’ve seen that too, sure.—Your town is destroyed by the enemy, andyou end up being wrongly accused of being the source of that disaster? This,too, has been seen before.—The whole town turns against you andeverybody line up to spit their anger, hate and despise to your face? Humm, I’mpretty sure I’ve seen this before. —The most important item in the whole gameworld is stolen from you, and the faithful guardian spirits who were always byyour side are scattered all around the world? Well, there are likely somevariations of this around.—You lose all your weapons, equipment anditems? This is a bit more unusual, maybe, but I’m sure it’s not unheard of. So, there is nothing unseen in the fabricof that plot twist, no event likely to shake you by virtue of its massiveoriginality. We’ve seen all of these elements before, without a doubt. But we’ve certainly not seen all of them unfoldat once, in the course of a singleplot twist. This is the first stroke of genius of thatplot twist, and the first factor that contributes to the huge emotional impactof the whole event. What you see in that plot twist is basically the painful andtotal unraveling of your life as a character. All hell breaks loose, and youhave to sit and watch powerless as everything you patiently built during thefirst half of the game is being torn to pieces and tramped down before your veryteary eyes. I’ve never seen a plot twist go that far in terms of stripping themain character of everything they care about and strived for, and you certainlyhave to give the developers kudos for having had the guts to go to such lengthsfor the sake of emotional impact and storyline consistency.  More gain, more painSo, the developers designed thisheart-breaking plot twist to start with; but you, as a player, also lent a handin making it so devastating, although you may have been totally unaware of itat the time.This is made possible because of thepeculiar nature of the 5th chapter of the game, which precedes thatfated plot twist. Unlike all the others chapters, the 5th is nottied to the clearance of a dungeon; it’s somehow a “breather” chapter, in whichyou can spend time interacting with NPCs and run errands for them, as well asinitiate the romance process. In fact, you are very explicitly encouraged to doso by a certain NPC, who even lets you know that you can indeed get asweetheart before the Tournament; and if you like the game, which is obviouslythe case if you’ve come that far, you willwant to indulge into these interactions. You will definitely want to clear asmany sidequests as possible, and to dive head first into the romance thing,hitting on your favourite bachelor and handing over presents like there’s notomorrow and no overdraft limit. You will crave for that, and you will work hard on it, o yes indeed, precious.And by doing so, you will pave the way foryour own misery when the plot twist comes your way: for the more you involveyourself into this 5th chapter and pour your heart and soul intothese interactions with the NPCs, the more your heart will ache when all hellbreaks loose. You will have to endure the searing pain of losing your newfoundsweetheart just after you worked so hard to woo them, becoming quite fond ofthem in the process. After you’ve grown attached to the townspeople withouteven realizing it through numerous interactions, it will be incredibly painfulto watch them accuse and accurse you unfairly for the destruction of the town.There is a nearly perverse mechanism at work here, and once again, kudos must bedelivered to the developers for having arranged things so neatly and designedthis 5th chapter so very cleverly, making it another stroke ofgenius. It is a bittersweet treat, which is bound to bring you both joy andpain; and the higher the joy, the deeper the pain, really. You took it for granted, didn’t you? But that’s not all, folks; for your miserygoes even further and deeper than this. In the course of that soul-shatteringplot twist, not only do you lose your lover, your best friend and anybody elseyou may care about, along with the trust and respect of your fellow townspeople;you also lose the Book of Prophecy and the Spirits. It hurts to have this Book,which you’ve been carefully taking care of and came to consider your own,brutally ripped away from you, especially since some of the pages are torn andlost in the process; it basically feels like all your hard work until now isbeing tramped down without pity. Seeing the friendly Spirits being scatteredaway is also quite heart-breaking, especially since there’s nothing you can doabout it. While this event obviously inserts into thein-game storyline, the impact of it goes much further than that, for itdrastically alters the gameplay itself. You suddenly find yourself unable tofight with your weapons, heal yourself and equip your gear, much less scanenemies and objects and modify them at will; and instead of being accompaniedby the constant babbling of the Spirits, you are now left in a complete,slightly surreal silence. This is a major rupture in the game, all the more soas by that time, you have grown accustomed to the use of the Book, andessentially take it for granted.  Onceagain, this is a very bold step taken by the developers: it’s not so often, ifever, that an element in the storyline translates into a change at the meta-levelof the gameplay itself. A third stroke of genius, and one bound to remind theplayer in the most shocking way that the Book is definitely more than a meremenu interface, should they have forgotten it. I’m a poor lonesome heroThe aftermath of all this mess isimmediate, and desolate: you find yourself in a nearly complete solitude,forlorn and dispirited—literally—as you try to get your head around what happened.The game then gives you a glimpse of relief when Lauca Meia and Heath take youunder their wing and help you, respectively by offering you shelter andteaching you a new fighting technique, and Rex comes out of the blue, seeminglyready to make amend for his damn stupid behaviour by retrieving the lost pagesof the Book. But this warm companionship is short-lived indeed, for you soonfind yourself alone again after everybody part to follow their own way. Thisparting left me disappointed and slightly anxious, yet there was no choice butto move forward.What follows is one of the most intensemoments of the game, as you find yourself going through the unknown EasternDesert in order to reach the Ruins and retrieve the Book, which is currently inOlly’s hands. You have to do so bare-handed, using this new fighting style thatyou’re still trying to grasp; and you have to do so nearly blindly, as youcan’t count on any map to orientate yourself. This, added to the desolate surroundings and the eerie music theme,creates a very powerful sense of fragility and insecurity. During this trip, yourhead is reeling with mixed feelings and emotions: sadness, resignation,resolve, and even a pang of guilt, especially regarding your lost lover, whoyou seemingly wooed only to drag them into this mess. I have to say that this desert trip, andthe emotions it elicited, reminded me a lot of my post-plot twist experiencewith Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening.I felt the same mix of sadness, resignation and resolve as I went through theFace Shrine dungeon, with its convoluted design and eerie music, my mind stillreeling from the impact of the devastating plot twist. There was also an similarfeeling of guilt; though not about some misery I did bring upon the people, butrather about the unavoidable misery I was about to bring to them by goingforward with my quest. All in all, two very similar experiences, both incrediblyintense and memorable. The road to recoveryAt the end of this feverish desert trip,you fight Olly and finally recover the Book. To do so is an exhilaratingexperience: at last, you are able to equip you weapons again, to orientate yourselfand to scan like there’s no tomorrow, not to mention that hey, it’s your precious Book after all, right? Thisis the very first step of a long road to recovery, in every sense of the world:from now on, you will have to set everything right, first by hunting for theSpirits and the missing pages in order to gain back the Book’s full power, thenby beating the bastards who created all this mess to a pulp. A heavy agenda,indeed; but after enduring such misery at the hands of Kullervo and his littlecronies, you’ll find yourself incredibly eager to recover what you fought sohard for in the first place. In fact, I can't remember having ever wanted that much to set things right while playing an RPG.The rest is history, as you’ll go through dangersand dungeons, reclaiming the faithful Spirits, the trust of the townspeople,and even your lover in the end, and finally erasing Kullervo from the face ofthe world. And when everything is said and done, you will undoubtedly rememberthat plot twist as one of the most striking, intense and mind-blowing that everunfolded before your eyes. Hey, it’s THAT Plot Twist, after all.Here ends my praise of Avalon Code. Therewould be plenty more to say about many more matters, from the romance to thehidden secrets of the game, but there are tons of excellent FAQ around therededicated to this very purpose and doing a much better job at it that I couldever do on that blog. My task was to praise that game and shout my love for itto the face of the internet, and I definitely feel that the deed is done. Thanksfor reading, and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Avalon Code (2): Lovely idiosyncrasies", "date": "21/01/2014", "text": "I love when my RPG strays from the classicalpath and offer some original features. And with Avalon Code, I certainly got myfill of such things. There would be tons of interesting details to mention; butfor the sake of brevity, and to avoid spoiling too much of the game, I willonly expose the five points which struck me as the most original and endearingwhile playing Avalon Code. There are no major spoilers here, so you can proceedunworried!1—Gone with the windTake a good look around: nearly everywhereyou go in the world of Avalon Code, you can see pieces of grass and leaves gently floating inthe air and being carried away by a seemingly endless soft breeze, while yourown coat is constantly moving in the most graceful way. When you walk next tosome trees, you can see flocks of birds take their flight. All these lovelyaerial animations give the game a touch of sweet, poetic liveliness that isentirely enjoyable. 2—Night trespassers—herm, suitorsThe world of Avalon Code is indeed astrange one. Guess how potential love interests who are smitten with yourdeclare their flame? Not by offering you flowers, taking you out for a romanticstroll, offering you dinner, or any other classic way. Instead, they sneak intoyour house at night, coyly greet you with a “Guess Who?” and demand that youactually identify them from the sound on their voice asking that questionalone; and if your guess is right, they will then profess their undying lovefor you. Now, I wonder if this is supposed to be taken literally: are thesefreaks really trespassing on your property in the middle of the night andstanding next to your bed while blurting out their confession like creepystalkers, or is it supposed to be something more allegorical? Like, a projectionof your own affection for them, or maybe some kind of telepathy? Guess we’llnever know for sure. But at any rate, it’s certainly original and quitememorable.3—Courtesy is SO overratedMaybe this whole night trespassing isfalling into a larger pattern of general callousness that prevails in AvalonCode’s world, after all. For let’s face it, people in this game are downrightrude. Some NPCs will sneer at you and hand over good doses of sarcasm, all thewhile seeming to enjoy it immensely, if the smug expressions on their faceswhile doing so are to be believed. Others will simply repeatedly refuse to speakto you and rebuff your communication attempts in the bluntest manner. Otherswill purely and simply insult you and belittle your abilities—and that categoryincludes your supposed best friend and your sword master, of all people. Talkabout keeping your enemies close. But don’t start thinking that your characteris the only pure, gracious, courteous little lamb in a flock of rude, bullyingrams, for that is not quite the case. As a matter of fact, your character givesothers a run for their money by being, every once in a while, as rude and bluntas the rest of them. During several cutscenes, your character will basicallyand literally turn their back on a NPC in the middle of an explanation andstart to walk away, visibly bored to death by the drone of the said NPC. I kidyou not. You have to see it to believe it, and it’s actually somewhat of a lightjaw-dropper, for being so uncommon in the RPG world, where heroes are alwayseager to listen to whatever woes are plaguing poor, unhappy NPCs. Still, don’tget the wrong idea and let this put you out: all this lack of courtesy belongsto the goofy side of the game, and is handled in a humorous, tongue-in-cheek mannerthat will often have you smile and grin. And let’s face it, it’s a refreshing andquirky change from the classic goody-goodiness and immaculate politenessboasted by heroes and friendly NPCs in most RPGs.  4—Bookworming galoreThe Book of Prophecy is, well, a book. Andas such, it contains tons of interesting data. You have codes and maps, ofcourse, but there is actually more to be found. By poking your stylus on theareas looking like lines of text in the pages of the book, you can uncover someinformation about the content of the page that you’re poking, from enemies’weaknesses to the particular piece of lore linked to a certain spot. Uncoveringthis data is as exciting as flipping through the pages of a good encyclopediain real life, and it adds a lot of depth to the game world; it also brilliantlyshows the love, passion and dedication of the game developers, who went togreat lengths to create a fully-fledged and deep game world. 5—Pixel huntingAs you start playing Avalon Code and roamthe game world, you may notice very quickly that by pressing the A button whilestanding in certain spots, you can trigger hidden captions describing elementsof the scenery. Those captions are cleverly concealed in every piece of theworld map outside of dungeons, and uncovering them can raise the value of theBook of Prophecy and sometimes reveal hidden items. This is some kind of secretfeature, for it is mentioned neither in the instruction booklet nor in the paper-thinin-game tutorials; and yet, for some reason, every Avalon Code player seems toknow about it. And while uncovering these secret captions is by no mean amandatory task, it can still become surprisingly addictive. In some areas, thedispatch of the captions follows some logic, and discovering this logic can bethrilling; in others, it turns to random pixel hunting and can really test yourpatience. But at any rate, it adds some depth to the game, by virtually turningevery section of the map into a mini-game of its own, and shows onceagain the dedication and care poured by the developers in the creation of thegame world.Bonus: When darkness falls (light spoilers)Remember that moment, at the end of The TwoTowers in the Lord of The Rings book trilogy, when a dark cloud creeps out ofMordor and spreads all over Gondor? Well, there is a similar event in AvalonCode. Towards the end of the storyline, darkness spreads across the whole world,accompanied by a perfectly fitted piece of music, all ominous double bass andburial bells. Pretty impressive, and very efficient in reminding you that, you know, the endis near. Brrrrr.Bonus: Welcome to the Matrix (lightspoilers)At some point in the game, you have tolearn a new fighting style, which is taught to you in a way that is veryreminiscent of Morpheus’s martial art lesson to Neo in The Matrix. Just like in The Matrix, it happens at a point in the storyline where your vision of the world have been shaken to the core, and is certainlyone of the finest and most well-crafted moments of Avalon Code. Not only is it bound to have a great psychological impact on the player, but it’s also highly enjoyable to play, for the said new fighting style is quite sleek and smooth—and very Matrix-like in style, indeed. Like I said, there are many more originaland endearing details woven in Avalon Code’s virtual fabric. If you’ve playedthe game, let me know which ones struck you the most! Thanks for reading, andbe my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Avalon Code (1): The brightest hidden gem of them all", "date": "18/01/2014", "text": "I am in LOVE with that game. Completely,deliriously, ridiculously in love. Avalon Code, developed by Matrix Software and released in 2008(jp), 2009(na) and 2010(eu) for the Nintendo DS, is theclassic example of an underrated game. It’s a great and polished RPG that, fora number of reasons, went mostly unnoticed at the time of its release and thenvery quickly slipped into obscurity. Before I purchased and started playing thisgame, I browsed through a few reviews out of curiosity, just to know what kindof game I should expect. Those reviews painted a basic picture of aslightly-above-average game, with somewhat gimmicky and occasionally cumbersomemechanics. A game that was indeed good, but by no means extraordinary, andwould certainly not rank amongst the best RPGs for the DS. And thus, my ideawas made. I expected a game that would offer me a nice experience, but wouldultimately not be that memorable, and would certainly not enter my personal RPGhall of fame.Boy, how utterly wrong I was.I fell in love with Avalon Code within thevery first minutes of playing. It totally blew my mind, and swept me with anoverwhelming sense on wonderment, elation and giddy joy that I had notexperienced with such intensity since my Solo Run of Dragon Quest IX. In myeye, this game feels like a true work of love, and an impressive one at that. Iwant to give it the praise I feel it rightfully deserves, and hopefully makemore people eager to discover that beautiful, sparkling hidden gem. But before that, I want to try to figureout how such a great game came to be so little known and underrated, whileexplaining at the same time what Avalon Code is all about. For it seems to methat the reasons why this gem slipped through the greatness radar and fell intoobscurity are somehow linked to the very nature of Avalon Code’s concept andgameplay. That (in)famous Book of ProphecyAvalon Code’s most distinctive and uniquefeature is the so-called “Book of Prophecy”, which you receive at the very beginningof the game. Long story short, it’s basically the most important item in thegame world, highly coveted by several villains, and it allows you to recorddata from people, monsters and others objects of interest. This data is made ofso-called “codes”, shaped like Tetris pieces, which you can recombine to yourliking in order to change said people and monsters’ attributes, as well ascreate all sorts of weapons, accessories and objects to help you during youradventure. The Book’s very existence and presence is of course justified by thestoryline, which puts you in the role of the “Chosen One” who will have theimportant role of recording into the Book everything valuable before the worldcomes to an end, and then decide what the new world will look like. This very distinctive feature is also themost universally lambasted by critics and players alike, who ramble endlesslyabout how cumbersome and inconvenient it is, and about how it turns out to be areally uncomfortable and unpractical menu system. And here is, in my opinion,the first great misconception that tipped Avalon Code towards that undeservedfall into obscurity: to reduce the Book to a mere menu interface, while it isactually so much more than that. While the menu is actually contained in the Book,the Book itself can definitely not be described as only a kind of glorified andsomewhat gimmicky menu system. At this point, we have to remember who createdthis game in the first place: Avalon Code is the brainchild of producerYoshifumi Hashimoto, of Harvest Moon and Rune Factory fame. The similaritiesbetween these two series and Avalon Code cannot be ignored and overlooked, asthey share the same basic principle of nurturing, organizing and tilling a definedspace in the game world. That defined space is pretty figurative in the Harvestand Rune series, as it happens to be a farm where you have to grow crops andtend animals, and more abstract in Avalon Code, where you are in charge of rearrangingTetris-shaped pieces of codes within the pages of a Book; but the idea at theroot of the gameplay is undeniably similar. You are expected to take charge ofthe Book and to organize it to your liking, for instance by grouping similarcodes together in some pages in order to make them easier to retrieve when theybecome necessary. Unfortunately, because the Book is so often seen andpresented as only a mere menu interface, most players don’t dare to modify itas much as they could, thus making the search for specific codes unnecessarilyharder and depriving themselves of the joy of mastering the Book and making ittheir own. It certainly doesn’t help that the whole concept is so abstract; infact, the abstraction of it all may very well have fuelled this unfortunatemisapprehension of reducing a key gameplay element to a mere menu gimmick.  Three games in oneThis reduction of the Book of Prophecy to amenu interface while it’s actually so much more is only the tip of the icebergwhen it comes to the net of misapprehension surrounding Avalon Code. The gameis nearly universally presented as an Action RPG with a few gimmicks, includingthe Book of Prophecy; but a closer look at it shatters this idea. Avalon Codeis no mere Action RPG; in fact, it’s technically not even a full-blown Action RPGto start with. Upon careful inspection and play, Avalon Code turns out to be agenuine mix of three different gaming genres, represented in fairly equalproportions. Now, that certainly makes the whole pictureharder to apprehend and fuels further dislike of the game. While many of us cangladly accept a twist on a familiar genre, approaching and appreciating a truemix of genres can be much more challenging, especially when the said genreshappens to differ wildly and when the player is expected to switch from onegenre’s style of gameplay to the other on the fly, which is precisely the casein Avalon Code. As for the three genres, here they are:—When dealing with the Book, the game playslike a Puzzle game. You are expected to use visual memory and strategicthinking as you cleverly reorganize codes in order to create new items and makethe Book your own carefully tilled field—albeit a rather abstract one, granted.As you progress through the game, you will obtain recipes to create new items,the most valuable of them being presented as sliding puzzles that you have tosolve first in order to get the much coveted recipe. Basically, as puzzle-likeas it can get without turning straight into Tetris.—When on the field or in dungeons, the gameplays like an action-adventure game, similar to the Zelda series. You are then expected to slay enemies on the goand solve practical puzzles entirely based on skill and good timing. You canhandle two different weapons at the same time, just like in Zelda games, andeven pull out a sword attack which is virtually a rip-off of Link’s SpinAttack. —When interacting with NPCs, the game playslike a glorified and expanded romance sim. The romance that you can initiatewith a few chosen NPCs is only a piece of that juicy expanded romance sim pie:in fact, by handing over presents like there’s no tomorrow, you can deepen yourrelationship with virtually every single character in the game and get to knowthem better through cutscenes, on top on getting interesting items that theywill gracefully hand you if you do their bidding.Like I mentioned earlier, these threestyles of gameplay constantly overlap: as a result, Avalon Code is much moredemanding and harder to master than a game sticking to a single genre. This isalso a bone of contention when it comes to criticizing the game, as manyreviewers and players felt the whole thing turned out to be messy andconfusing, without really being able to pinpoint the exact reason why it feltso. But when all is sorted out and when one knows what to expect, it’s reallyjust a matter of being patient and dedicated enough to learn how to masterAvalon Code’s complex patchwork of a gameplay.From giggles to tearsAnother point that rubbed some reviewers thewrong way is Avalon Code’s unevenness when it comes to its general tone. MostRPGs choose a type of atmosphere and stick to it all along the storyline,whether it’s dark, solemn, melancholic or light-hearted; but Avalon Code is agame that stubbornly refuses to commit to a single mood. In fact, Avalon Codemay very well be the ultimate gaming incarnation of mood swings: here is a gamethat switches shamelessly from one tone to the next in the blink of an eye. Let’s first tackle the bright side of theForce. Avalon Code is a game that is unashamedly goofy. Goofiness basicallypops up in every place, and no place or circumstance is sacred enough to bespared by this invasion. It pops up in the middle of fights, with thedeliciously ridiculous Judgment Link move and the equally deliciouslyridiculous dedicated music that accompanies it. It pops up in the peculiardressing style of many characters, which will make your eyes bleed. Heck, thisis a game in which minotaurs don kilts and in which your very characterthemselves are dressed like they basically jumped into the first pieces ofclothing they drew out of the closet. It seeps from tons of cutscenes andone-liners making fun of characters, so much so that in the end, everybody getstheir fifteen minutes of shame. Yep, even the king of the country, and evenyour main character. On some occasions, the goofiness even takes a step furtherand gets a corny edge. This corny edge, as you may imagine, appears mostlythrough the romance scenes. I have very little interest in romance in generalwhen it comes to fiction or videogames, and tend to be rather blasé about it;and yet, I found myself grinning stupidly more than once as the romantic scenesunfolded. But as the Force, this game has a muchdarker side. The overall story actually has a rather dark tone to start with,casting you as a character whose mission is to save valuable things before theworld’s imminent destruction, rather than to prevent that said destructionitself as in most RPGs. That very story then throws at you one of the mostshocking plot twist I’m ever seen in a videogame, leaving your character inabsolute misery and yourself in a whirlwind of conflicting emotions (and as youmay expect, there will be a post about this). Towards the end of the storyline,the atmosphere gets darker and darker, both literally and figuratively, asthough the game feels compelled to remind you at every second that, you know, theworld is going to end soon; and it does so in a way that is incrediblyeffective. And yet, at the same time, you can still practice the silly JudgmentLink move in combat, or get corny love confessions.  So yes, this game has mood swings; and sowill you when you play it. This is a game that will make you grin and gigglelike a teenager at times, and feel sad and miserable at others. You will gofrom peaks of elation to pits of misery in the course of a single playthrough.Like it or not, that’s how Avalon Code is, and it’s not necessarily a badthing, especially since it’s so craftily executed. And all that’s in betweenApart from all this, Avalon Code’s road toglory may have been hampered by a few other elements that set it dramaticallyapart from the current trends in videogaming. —This game is HARD. It’s not one of thoseRPGs that will have you brag about clearing a whole playthrough while dyingonly twice. You WILL die in this game, and you will die a lot; so much, infact, that you soon won’t bother keeping track of your deaths. You will diebecause enemies are numerous, vicious and determined to knock you dead, andyour life bar starts off as miserably tiny. On top of that, the weapons takesome training to get used to, and even the seemingly ridiculous Judgment Linkmove is quite hard to master, causing you to die again and again at the handsof enemies until you become an expert in all thing fighting. Still, this is noGhost’n’Goblins: Avalon Code remains fair in its hardness and shows some mercy,allowing you to start again from the point where you die and to save yourprogression at any moment. So while there is undoubtedly an element of patientdie&retry here, it’s thankfully not a punishing one.—This game is CRYPTIC. Tutorials, whenthere are any, are reduced to a bare minimum, and even the manual is far frombeing exhaustive when it comes to game features and mechanics. Thus, you areleft having to figure out a lot of things by yourself, by exploring and pokingyour nose and stylus all around the place. (Once again, quite a Zelda-likefeature, in my opinion.) —This game is DEMANDING. Not only is thelearning curve steep, but it also branches out in different directions, due tothe mix of gameplay styles at the core of the game. It requires patience anddedication, and a lot of practice. On top of that, Avalon Code doesn’t flauntits secrets easily: in fact, if you want to see all that the game has to offer,you will very likely have to tackle more than one playthrough. Even more thantwo or three, for that matter. Some items are basically too well-hidden to bediscovered on a first playthrough, and may only be discovered on subsequentones, as your knowledge and understanding of the game’s logic increases. On topof that, Avalon Code boasts a resolutely conservative approach when it comes toromance, allowing you to date only one character at a time. It also offersdifferent types of romantic scenes, depending at which moment of the game youwoo potential sweethearts. This, combined to the fact that you can play as amale or a female character, means that if you want to see the unfolding of allthe romance events for all the potential bachelors, you will have to replay thegame numerous times. Plain and simple. And unashamedly demanding. Now, of course, this can also be seen as highreplay value; and replay value is good, o yes precious. So, while these points don’t lower thequality of the game by any means, one has to admit that they are not exactly intouch with the mood of the times. In a gaming era that gave birth to games likeFinal Fantasy XIII and Beyond: Two Souls, which play virtually like interactivemovies, the notions of die&retry, meticulous exploration, patience andperseverance are not likely to make a hit. These are concepts that hark backto the old days of 8 and 16-bits gaming, when difficulty was not considered a majordeterrent to gaming; and I strongly think that difficulty of this sort stillshouldn’t be a deterrent to gaming and get in a game’s way to greatness. So, this is what Avalon Code is all about.I really feel that most critics approached that game with a set of mind thatwas too narrow, reducing it to less than what it actually is and brushing itoff way too quickly. This is definitely a shiny hidden gem that needs to berediscovered, appreciated, cherished and, last but not least, played to death.I’m not done yet with that game, both on this blog and on my DS; oh no! There’smore coming soon!Thanks for reading, and be my guestanytime!"},
{"title": "Dragon Quest IX-The Elusive Solo Run (4): Tips and tricks for the road", "date": "11/01/2014", "text": "Here come the fourth and final post of myDragon Quest IX Solo run feature, in which I will provide a few tips to helpyou make the most of it, before giving my final thoughts on the matter. Withoutfurther ado, let’s get started!Tip#1: critical hits are a loner’s baneThe biggest threat to the smoothprogression of your Solo Run lies in the critical hits, which can be devastatingwhen fighting a boss. These dangerous blows can drain your HP in tremendousamounts, forcing you to waste precious time and resources to heal yourself—thatis, if they don’t knock you out entirely in the first place. Since criticalhits are bound to land on you during every single boss fight, you cannot count onluck alone to avoid them, and must find a surer way to do so. And fortunately,there is one in the game. The only way to forever get rid of the critical hitsthreat is to raise your Shield Skill to 100, and then equip a shield at alltimes. By doing so, your shield will automatically deflect any critical hitaimed at you, leaving you totally unscathed, with the added bonus of the enemylosing one turn. You don’t even specifically need to trigger this skill duringa fight, for it remains active at all times—which makes it even sweeter, ifthat’s even possible.Tip#2: become your very own private tankIn a classic Party Run, you can have onecharacter acting specifically as a shield and protector for the rest of theteam by taking all the nasty blows aimed at other party members. This characteris usually referred to as a “tank”, and sure enough, there is a class dedicatedto that function in Dragon Quest IX, which is the Paladin. The problem is, youcannot use this class to protect yourself in a Solo Run, for it is specificallydesigned to protect others. Yet, you still have to protect yourself asefficiently as possible. It’s especially true in some of the boss fights: someboss have regular hits that are nearly as devastating as critical hits in termof HP cost, and can basically force you into a vicious circle of having to healevery single turn without ever being able to attack them. The best way to avoidsuch a nasty turn of events is to make good use of what I would call the“deflecting abilities”. There are two skills in the game that are designed tofire the enemy’s blows back at them, leaving you fresh and untouched whilehurting the enemy in the process. The first one is “Back Atcha”, available inthe Shield Skill Tree at the 82 points mark, which deflects physical attacks.It only lasts one turn, and has to be activated again for further use. Thesecond one is “Magic Mirror”, also available in the Shield Skill Tree at the 40points mark, which deflects magical attacks. Its effect lasts for a few turns,allowing you to conveniently land hits in the meantime. Those two skills shouldbe put to good use, for they offer great protection to the Solo Runner and caneven allow you to win boss battles that may have seemed impossible at first. Tip#3: Spear, Axe and SilverOne of the most beloved staples in theDragon Quest series in the presence of the infamous Metal Slimes. These elusivebeasts, which are seldom spotted and are notoriously prone to escape, canreward you with a ridiculously high amount of experience points if you manageto take them down. But that is not a feat easily achieved, for these slipperymetalized slimes have a strong tendency to flee from battle after only ahandful of turns. The most common way to beat them on a classic party setting isto have your whole team ganging up on them with attacks tailored againstanything metal and destroy them before they can even stand a chance to escape;but that is obviously not a viable option for a Solo Run. You will usually onlyhave two or three turns to attack before they run away, and no metal-tailoredattack is strong enough to take them down in so short a time. In order to doso, you must resort to a duo of very specific attacks, designed to aim acritical hit when they succeed, the probability of doing so being of 50%. Itmay seem low, but it’s a much better and surer way to wipe out metal slimesthan any other attack you could use. These two attacks are “Thunder Thrust”,available in the Spear Skill Tree at the 58 points mark, and “Hatchet Man”,available in the Axe Skill Tree at the 58 points mark. They come quite cheapcompared to the amount of goodness they can reap, and landing a successfulcritical hit on a huge Metal King Slime by using one of these two deadly moveswill bring a tremendous amount of satisfaction, along with an equallytremendous amount of XP. Tip#4: be SwiftAgility is an important ability that tendsto be often overlooked. Your Agility stats, compared to the ones boasted byyour foe, determine who will attack first: the one with the highest Agilitygets the first turn. Now, you can imagine how crucial high Agility stats maybecome in a Solo Run: it can basically make the difference between a good and abad start in a fight, by giving you time to cast a welcome shielding ability beforeyour foe gets the chance to land a hit on you, or slice that Metal King Slimein two before it manages to escape. The best way to raise your Agility is toget 100 points on the Martial Artist’s Focus Skill Tree. Doing so will grantyou 100 extra Agility points, which will be enough to give you an edge overvirtually every single enemy, including Metal Slimes. Well, that will be it for the tips!Hopefully they will be of some use to any aspirant loner, and will help turn afuture Solo Run into a great and memorable experience. I really encourage anyDragon Quest IX fan to try this way of playing at least once, especially sinceit may very well have been the very way the game was designed to be played inthe first place. Now that may seem a little weird and far-fetched to assumesuch a thing, but think of it for a second: it’s fairly well-known that DragonQuest IX was originally intended to be a more action-oriented RPG, with astrong focus on multiplayer. It would then seem logic to assume that it wouldfeature a single character created and trained by the player, interacting atwill with others characters also created and trained by others players. (Thismakes even more sense given that, as I mentioned earlier, Action-RPGs usually tendto be solo affairs.) This direction was then abandoned due to irate fansprotesting against it, and Dragon Quest IX ended up as a fairly traditionalturn-based RPG, much like the other entries in the series. Yet, the possibilityof recruiting your own party of computer-created characters strongly feels likeit’s been added only as an afterthought to content long-time fans and make themfeel more at home. Had it been planned from the very start, the teammates wouldhave been included in the storyline, much like in Dragon Quest IV or VI. Yetthey are not, and are actually little more than a pis aller for players whowant to play the traditional way on their own without resorting to themultiplayer option. So here’s my point: by playing Dragon Quest IX solo, youmay actually be tapping at the game’s forgotten and deeply buried roots, andrekindle the way it was supposed to be played in the first place. This is onlymy own theory, and I may be entirely wrong; but the Solo Run is such a smoothand rich experience that it’s really hard to believe that the game was not,indeed, initially designed to be played that way. “Try it and see foryourselves, and have loads of fun doing so!” will be my final words on thematter, concluding this Dragon Quest IX Solo Run feature. Thanks for reading,and be my guest anytime!"},
{"title": "Dragon Quest IX-The Elusive Solo Run (3): Why it is so good ", "date": "05/01/2014", "text": "Here comes the third part of my Solo Runfeature, in which I will focus on the various reasons that make a Solo Run suchan enjoyable and unique experience. A Solo Run of Dragon Quest IX is, indeed, arather fascinating experience, which sheds a different light on the whole game.Some elements tend to be magnified by it, others reduced or entirely erased,creating a different game experience from the one you would have playing with afull-blown party. Here are the reasons that make this experience unique andwell worth-trying:The “Chosen One” factorA Solo Run tremendously reinforces thefeeling of being THE Lonely Hero who bears on their frail shoulders (or maybenot so frail, as we’ll see in the next paragraph) the responsibility of savingthe whole world. Wandering alone on the huge world map is an experience like noother; it casts you as a lone ranger in a massive world and makes you trulyfeel like a full-fledged explorer. On top of that, it makes your experiencemore cohesive with the story and the cutscenes, where you always appear alone,and removes the unsatisfying experience of having your party members starringvirtually no role in the storyline and never appearing in the said cutscenes. The “Overpowered” factorAs I mentioned in my post about themisconceptions related to the Solo Run, there is definitely a sweet andexhilarating thrill in controlling a single character that may ultimatelybecome able to wield every single weapon in the game and to master every spell,attack and ability, which is achieved by raising both the weapon and passiveskills stats to 100, along with tackling all the sidequests related to theaccess to extra classes and special attacks. Even more thrilling is the factthat you can reach this ultimate and comprehensive mastery much earlier thanyou would while playing with a full party, due to the faster leveling-upprocess. I personally managed to get the twelve available classes and raise ALLmy stats to 100 after roughly 65 hours of gameplay, thus gaining access to thisdelicious state of mastery, and then spent the rest of my playthrough toyingendlessly with the many possibilities that were offered to me and enjoying themto the fullest. The “Get the Best Gear” factorThis may be a mere detail, but it is onethat definitely has some importance in RPGs. By playing Solo, you will alwayshave enough monetary resources to buy the best equipment available right awayin every new town you visit, being thus as fully prepared as you can for theunavoidable local challenge that lies ahead and avoiding the frustration ofbeing taunted by tempting yet unaffordable items, lest you spend two hoursgrinding for money.  If you’ve ever been playing with a party and struggling to make ends meet, all the while despairingto see your party donning lousy mismatched equipment, you know what I’m talkingabout. And believe me, that may be but a detail, but it’s a very sweet one indeed,and one you may definitely appreciate. The “Menu Navigation is so deliciouslysleek!” factorEver been trudging through the menu systemafter you recruited your party, going from menu to sub-menu in a tedious,time-consuming attempt to get things done? Ever been stranded in a shop,wracking your brain in a desperate attempt to keep your focus and get whatevergear suits each one of your character without ending up entirely confused andlost in the process? Ever raged and fumed about the whole unbearable unwieldinessof anything related to menu navigation? If yes, then the Solo Run will undeniably make your life better, o yesprecious. One Character, One Menu to rule them all: plain and simple, anddefinitely enjoyable. The “Fresh Strategies” factorPlaying Solo will definitely lead you touse creative thinking, and come up with specific strategies tailored to thatway of playing. Instead of going for the traditional “buff-debuff-attack-heal”combo, you will have to figure out the most efficient way to take down foeswith a more limited set of abilities, since you can only don one class at atime; doing so may involve a class change in order to get the most fittedabilities to beat a specific boss, or the resort to some moves that you wouldnever have used in a classic playthrough with a party. It globally forces youto use your resources and abilities to the fullest, and creates some veryinteresting challenges that make a Solo Run all the more interesting andexciting.The “Originality” factorTraditionally, Turn-based RPGs are partyaffairs, while the whole “lonely hero” thing rather graces the realm of ActionRPGs. The juxtaposition of a single hero and turn-based battles that comesforth in a Solo Run is thus a highly innovative configuration, and has to beenjoyed as such. One again, this may be a detail; but in the RPG landscape,where most titles tend to routinely recycle the same features andcharacteristics, any change that brings a new and fresh experience to the genreis always welcome. That will be it for the good reasons thatmake a Solo Run enjoyable. In the next post, I will conclude this feature bygiving a few useful tips for the road. Thanks for reading, and be my guestanytime!"},
{"title": "Dragon Quest IX-The Elusive Solo Run (2): Misconceptions", "date": "28/12/2013", "text": "Here comes the second part of my DragonQuest IX Solo Run feature. In this part, we aim for the dispelling of thosehindering misconceptions and the clearance of the thorny patch of prejudiceblocking the road to the Solo Run. I spotted five main misconceptions, which Iwill expose and mercilessly tear to pieces under your very eyes. Lo and behold!Misconception #1: A Solo Run is impossibleThis one takes the cake. It’s the mostcommon misconception of them all, and one that will prevent many a player fromtrying a Solo Run in the first place, or even dare to consider the matter atall. It stems partly from the fact that when you arrive at Stornway and getintroduced to the prospect of fighting the resident boss of the area, severalNPCs advise you to recruit a party in order to take down that mighty foe. Whilethis may rightfully be interpreted as a way to let you know that the game isbecoming too difficult to tackle with a single character, and is indeed ofteninterpreted so, I think that this is really nothing more than a cleverlydisguised way of informing you that you now have the possibility to recruit aparty if such is your desire, either by using the multiplayer option or bycreating it from scratch. If these warnings from the townspeople were indeed areliable indication that Dragon Quest IX cannot be played solo from the momentyou reach Stornway, then the game would find a way to prevent you from goingforward on your own, which it does not.Another point that allows thismisconception to arise is the fact that even with a party by your side, thegame remains exigent. It often forces you into level grinding, usually beforemeeting bosses, and those boss fights are challenging in their own right, evenwith a conveniently leveled-up party. The perfectly logical reasoning here isthat if the game is demanding even with the help of a party, then it has to beentirely impossible with a single character. And yet it is not so. How can thatbe, you may ask? Well, it all boils down to the leveling up system. In DragonQuest IX, every fight you win will bring you a fixed number of experiencepoints, which will then be divided and dispatched between your party members,and that number of points remains the same no matter how many characters are inyour party. This basically means that when you are playing solo, your singlecharacter will reap all the experience points, and thus level up faster thanthey would with party members. This sped-up leveling process will compensatefor the absence of a party, and allow you to play as comfortably as if you hadparty members by your side, if not more. I’ll come back to this later.Misconception#2: A Solo Run is possible,but it can only take you so farThe idea here is that sooner or later, overthe course of the game, you will encounter foes too powerful to be taken downby a single character. There may actually be a glimmer of truth in thisstatement; however, the point you can reach before being overpowered, if thisindeed happens, is much, much further in the game than one would imagine atfirst.My own Solo Run took me far beyond theconfines of the main game. After having beaten the final boss to a pulp, Isuccessfully took down all the bosses of the downloadable quests, nine of thetwelve grotto bosses, and Baramos. After that, I stopped playing Dragon QuestIX and moved on to another game, so I have no idea if I could have progressedfurther on my own; but that is already an impressive enough journey, goingactually much further than most Dragon Quest IX players even care toventure.  So, rest assured that there isactually plenty of time to enjoy on a Solo Run, and that you will clock arespectable number of playing hours before being stuck and stranded in atoo-weak-to-go-on limbo, if this ever happens.Misconception#3: A Solo Run is possible,but it makes the game so much harderOnce again, this stems from the notion thatif the game is already a tough nut to crack with a full party, then itlogically has to be even tougher with a single character. One can easilyimagine that more grinding will be needed and that the boss battles will bemuch more challenging; in fact, I actually did so myself, before I learnedbetter.I had the opportunity to compare the two situations, since my very firstplaythrough was a fairly classical one, in which I recruited three partymembers to support my main character. I took that playthrough quite far (up tothe point when you’re about to return to your homeland after having recoveredthe seven Macguffins of the story, for those who've already played the game) and that gave me a pretty good notion of theamount of grinding required to progress in the game. When I engaged into mySolo Run, I virtually noticed no visible difference in that field; thatdefinitely dissipated my fears of having a much harder ride as a lone ranger,and it should also dissipate yours, should you have any. As for the bossbattles, they actually tend to be easier, if anything. This is mostly due tothe fact that many of the bosses’ attacks are designed to hurt and wipe out thewhole party, thus falling flat when dealing with a single character, and makingyou feel that most bosses are really nothing more than overpowered versions ofthe basic enemies you meet on the field.Misconception#4: A Solo Run is possible,but it makes the game so much more boringOnce again, here is one that may contain atiny weeny bit of truth, depending on what makes you tick. If your biggestsource of joy and excitement in a game like Dragon Quest IX is to craft andmicromanage a perfectly balanced party of characters with complementaryabilities, then yes, you may indeed find the game more boring with a singlecharacter, since you can only don one given class at a time. However, there isstill plenty of enjoyment to be found in a Solo Run, and the strange and sweetexhilaration of controlling an overpowered character capable of showing off somany different fighting styles and abilities and wielding so many differentweapons should be enough to satiate most players. Oh, and let’s not mention thestory, the sidequests, the epic fights, the thrill of being the Chosen One whowill save the World, and all these other things that make RPG so great, whetherthey are played solo or with a party.Misconception#5: A Solo Run is possible,but only with Class X or YThe last one of my list, this is also themost minor and innocuous of the bunch. Yet, it is still a misconception thatmay rob potential soloists of a part of their rightly deserved enjoyment byinducing them to stick strictly to a given class, thus neglecting to discoverthe interesting possibilities offered by others. And that would be a pity, forone of the core joys of a Solo Run is to change classes on the fly and indulgeinto many different fighting styles. As a matter of fact, there is really nosuch thing as a mandatory class for a Solo Run in Dragon Quest IX; some classesmay make your progression easier, depending on what you’re doing, but no classwill make the Solo Run unplayable. It really all boils down to your goals at agiven moment, and to the kind of fighting style you favor. I personallyswitched classes regularly during my Solo Run, either to tackle certain eventsor just for the sheer pleasure of trying something different. I actually spenta good amount of time as an Armamentalist, a class that possesses no healingspells and focuses mostly on buff and debuff; not the most obvious and cleverchoice for a Solo Run, obviously.  Yet, Idid pretty fine and progressed without a hitch, taking down mighty bosses alongthe way.Well, that’s all for the misconceptions!Hopefully any reservations about a Solo Run will now be cleared, making way foran eagerness to try the whole thing and see what it has in store. To continuethis Dragon Quest feature about the Elusive Solo Run, I will next bring forwarda number of good reasons to try out the lone way. Thanks for reading, and be myguest anytime!"},
{"title": "Dragon Quest IX-The Elusive Solo Run (1): Introduction", "date": "22/12/2013", "text": "On with the show! In this first feature, Iam going to tackle the very specific and little-known subject of the Solo Runin Dragon Quest IX. For the sake of clarity, it will contain several separatearticles, on which I will expand on various matters. And first, let’s startwith a nice, juicy introduction!Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the StarrySkies, developped by Level-5 and Square-Enix and released in 2009(jp) and 2010(na, eu, aus) for the Nintendo DSexclusively, is one of the most well-known and praised RPG available on thesystem. It is the ninth installment of a venerable series of turn-basedJapanese RPG that started way back in 1986 on the Famicom and enjoyed a hugepopularity in its native country. The series came to American shores verysporadically in the 80’s and 90’s, with only a handful of games being releasedthere under the name “Dragon Warrior”, while it avoided Europe entirely. Only withthe worldwide release of the eighth game for the PS2 in 2005 and 2006 did theseries’ recognition really pick up the pace in Europe and USA, where it becamea new favourite amongst RPG lovers. The Dragon Quest series tend to be fairlyold-school in its approach, harkening back to the old days of the RPG genre. Itusually involves a team of typically specialized characters such as warriors,mages, healers and so on, fighting turn-based battles and exploring a vastworld that they invariably have to save, all that wrapped in a rather bare andbasic storyline and generously peppered with tons of grinding. It’s also highlyrecognizable, with features that reappear in every entry and give the player animmediate sense of familiarity, such as the main musical theme, the job systemor the slime enemies.Many western gamers, including myself,probably discovered the series with this ninth installment. An installment thatis famous for its local multiplayer feature, a first in the series; and whilethis feature was hugely appreciated and made the most of in Japan, whereeverybody and their brother owns a DS and plays it virtually everywhere, itmostly failed to catch up in Europe and USA. Fortunately, you can also play thegame on your own, and replace the enrollment of friends’ avatars throughmultiplayer by the recruitment of a team of customized mercenaries generated bythe game, which is the option that most players choose. But, to quote Yoda inThe Empire Strikes Back, “there is another”. And that other option, youngPadawan, is the Solo Run, which basically involves playing the whole game withonly the main character, without recruiting a team. Yep, it is possible, andvery much so; and it's a great experience to boot. But I'm getting ahead ofmyself here: let's first clear that murky matter a little bit.The Solo Run in Dragon Quest IX is asubject that tends to be inexplicably shrouded in mystery. An internet searchon the matter only garners a handful of results, most of them being excerptsfrom fan forums, in which gamers do wonder and ponder if a Solo Run is really,indeed, an attainable feat. Despite the fact that nothing actually prevents theplayer from choosing to attempt a Solo Run in the course of the game, mostgamers and reviewers alike seem to be entirely unaware of this option. In fact,many gamers and reviewers go as far as to claim that it is mandatory to recruita team if one wants to progress in the game and clear it, which is entirelyfalse. Even more baffling, the official Dragon Quest IX Strategy Guide fromBradygames itself does not refer to this way of playing a SINGLE time over thecourse of its nearly 450 pages. Clearly, random individuals may make falseclaims about something they didn’t experience first-hand; but a supposedlywell-researched strategy guide ignoring the matter entirely? Now that’ssomething far more unexpected and puzzling, and that says a lot about theelusiveness of the whole Solo Run matter.The very way I personally came uponexperiencing the Solo Run fits perfectly into that picture, and speaks volumesabout how ridiculously elusive it indeed is. I did not attempt a Solo Runbecause I was seeking challenge, nor because I was curious about the matter. Infact, that possibility didn’t even dawn on me a single second when I firstplayed the game; instead, like virtually every Dragon Quest IX player, I wentfor the “classic” way by dutifully recruiting a team when the option was madeavailable, a few hours into the game. And while I had deeply enjoyed these veryfirst hours as a loner, everything started to fall apart from the moment ofthat fated recruitment. As time went on, I grew intensely bored with theconstant toiling and cumbersome micro-management that I had to put into myteam, and totally blasé by their lack of participation in the storyline; somuch so that I finally gave up on the game, entirely disgusted. Shortly afterthat first aborted playthrough did the idea of trying out a Solo Run rise outof the blue, and it was solely motivated by a desperate desire to get rid ofthe chore of pampering that accursed team and rekindle the passion I had feltfor the game in the early hours, when I was still roaming the world as asolitary hero. And so, with a great deal of trepidation and anticipation, Istarted the said Solo Run. What followed was one of the most thorough,fulfilling and exhilarating RPG playthrough I ever experienced in my wholegaming life, a playthrough that left me deeply sated and content, with a littlebit more than 200 hours of intensely enjoyable gameplay under my belt.So yes, a Solo Run in Dragon Quest IX isindeed an attainable feat, which I successfully attempted myself. And since thematter is so elusive and so deeply shrouded in mystery, it may be useful todispel a few misconceptions about it that tends to be running rampant; and thatwill precisely be the subject of my next posts. (Here are part 2, part 3 and part 4.) Thanks for reading, and be myguest anytime!"},

But all that does notmatter. All you want to do is achieve one last goal. Your whole mind isacutely, painfully set upon this: before you finally indulge into awell-deserved rest, you want to grind just a tad more, and gain one more level. Yep; that’s it. THAT extra level. Thatever-elusive, ever-taunting extra level. Always more alluring than the last oneyou reached, keeping you playing more and more. That Extra Level.You may have figured out now where I’mgoing from there. This blog is mostly going to cover the glorious realms ofRPG, although I will also cover other genres every now and then. When I sayRPG, I mean every single type of RPG under the sun: Strategy-RPG, Action-RPG,Turn-based RPG, J-RPG, Dungeon Crawler, you name it. When it comes to thisfavourite genre of mine, I just gladly take everything that comes my way. Itmay also be worth noting that I exclusively play on portable systems, akahandhelds; namely, the Nintendo 3DS, the Playstation Vita, the Nintendo DS, thePSP and the Gameboy Advance. I also enjoy the occasional trip down memory laneby picking up a 16-bits era RPG once in a while, and I may cover these too. That being said, on with the journey!"}
