{"title": "Ann and Jane - Their YouTube Videos, Cookbooks, and their infectious zest for life and food!!", "date": "Monday, August 14, 2023", "text": "Once I knew my eating life was going to change and center mostly around a plant based diet, ... and once I found a way to control my disappointment that this would be forever, ... and once I recognized that my body had already been evolving in that direction anyway, ... and once I accepted the time involved to develop a library of meals that were good,... and once I adopted the idea that I would need to do more cooking (!!yikes!!), Yeah ... once I got passed a few little bumps in the road - I decided to change up my approach.  After all, what we enjoy in life is frequently influenced attitude ... and I had to 'go find me' a different attitude!! I started with YouTube videos because they were cheap (free) and I could skim through various feeds quickly (‘cause not everyone out there is good at this, you know.)   I don’t know how many videos I started then skipped before I came to an almost hour long video called:                Fresh Start! An Intro to Plant-Based Eating for Newbies.  That's me - Newbie and a Fresh Start is what I was looking for!  At first a man was briefly going over the main points of this diet.  Ok, I was good with that. But behind him his wife starting doing silly things as each point was introduced.  That was corny.  I decided to skip it.  I watched and skipped a few other videos, and then I came to another video with this same woman (Jane) and her mother (Ann), and they were cooking together, chatting away, and obviously enjoying each other’s company. Something just drew me in.  I paused that video, and I returned to the Fresh Start video - and this time I listened to the full hour.  What followed was Ann (mother, age 87) and Jane (daughter, age 56) cooking together and talking about the topic of Plant-Based eating.  They were charming.  It looked totally unrehearsed, the background was Ann’s very normal kitchen, there were no edits,  or no glossy professional food pictures. The video just ran and their little disagreements were captured but never taken seriously, and they both were filled with enthusiasm and joy for this Plant Based diet.  By the end of the hour, I was totally hooked!In the picture on the right - the two ladies in the Yoga pose - Ann, the mother, is on the right.At the time the book was published, she was 88!  What wasn’t evident initially was the real science from the Esselstyn Foundation and family life experiences behind this very like-able pair.  Ann is the wife of Dr. Caldwell B Esselstyn, the author of a book Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease.  Ann then wrote the recipe companion book called Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease Cookbook.   In addition, their whole family, (adult children, adult children’s spouses, and grandchildren) are all plant based.  Ann and Jane have over 140 videos on YouTube demonstrating various food prep strategies, and they are the authors of the book Be A Plant-Based Woman Warrior which I ordered.  It is an amazing book.  Extremely well done and very inviting.  So ... did I find my new attitude?  I did.  I totally love these two lovely ladies and their approach. Now here is my disclaimer on all this. My goal is to improve my diet.  I believe eating a more plant based diet will do that following many of their guidelines.  But have I adopted ALL their practices without exception? No. Here are my exceptions.Eat nothing with a face: Well ... if you are plant based, that is an expectation, but in social situations I'll be flexible just to be polite.  That shouldn’t happen often.  This is about diet choices, not cult obedience! One animal protein meal now and then won’t undo months of plant based eating.No eggs, no dairy: Hmm ....  I eat eggs or egg whites every morning.  If I start my day with anything else, I am hungry at 10:30 am.  I'll listen to my body for now and keep to my routine.  And no fat plain greek yogurt is a healthy choice in almost every other diet. It will remain in my diet occasionally. No oil:  I can drastically reduce my oil intake, but minimal olive oil will stay.Other plant based guidelines strongly recommended by Dr. Esselstyn and company that I can get behind are:  avoid salt (buy salt free products) and minimize sugar, eat greens 6 times a day - as much as possible, eat more oats - as much as possible, eat lots of beans and lentils, eat whole grains, limit coconut, nuts and avocados (eliminate those 3 entirely if you have heart disease,) eat a tablespoon of chia seeds and/or flax seed meal each day, drink lots of water, read the ingredients of any item you purchase.  Got it! I suspect their ideas are very similar to that of others who espouse plant based eating.  But what the mother and daughter team brought to me was their total joy and fun and enthusiasm for cooking and eating a plant based diet ... all of it presented in a way that says ... “Yup!! - you can do this -  follow us.”I am following."},
{"title": "Back again with a Leona and Lennie Update", "date": "Saturday, August 12, 2023", "text": "The “update\" of Leona and Lennie(thank you Wendy for the Liver name Lennie - it is perfect!) is short and sweet.  All seems pretty quiet with no changes.  Leona, the singleton kidney, is still plugging along at a kidney function in the 30s or Stage 3, and it may be a year or more before we see any movement upward (or maybe never if my Internist is correct.)   As far as Lennie, my bigger than normal liver, is concerned, no news is good news.  Lab work is normal.  Of course, making life easier for Lennie, might help him shrink - only time will tell.  And how do you make life easier for a kidney and a liver??  Life style changes, it appears.  No magic pill or treatment.  An improved diet and exercise routine.  Easy-peasy, right?Sort of.Diet wise I was drifting towards a Mediterranean Diet about a year and a half ago.  I was not rigid in that choice, but it was just a way to drop some poor choices off my dinner plate without making too large a split from the foods my husband preferred.  This past spring, however, when my medical concerns shifted from - “gosh I am getting old” to “yikes, one kidney down, cancer avoided and a fatty liver” ... my diet decisions shifted into high gear.  Lean protein and less less of it, reduced salt, lower potassium and phosphorus, complex carbs and less of them too, and minimal fats - just to name the big players in the food story. It seemed like only one “diet structure” fit those concerns: plant based eating.  And to be honest, that kind of eating suits me very well. While I welcome these food changes, it comes with some effort.I don’t live alone - and my spouse is a 'meat and potatoes' kind of guy.  While he supports whatever I want to do with my diet, he is not interested in any changes to his diet.  I support that - in theory.  The consequence, however, of two separate diets means more planning and more cooking for me.  And I am not wild about cooking.  But I am finding work-arounds.  I still make his favorites, but he knows he will be eating them as left overs since I am not sharing in those meals any more. For my diet, the work is harder.  I don’t have a lifetime of plant based recipes ready to whip out like I do for him.  I am still figuring out the basics:  finding and experimenting with recipes, discovering half of what I make for myself I don’t want to repeat, locating cooks and cookbooks that offer reasonable creations that don’t involve 20+ different ingredients, some that are hard to find and may never be used again.  And finding plant based recipes that don’t rely on salt to punch up the flavor is an advanced study course well beyond the basics.And speaking of salt, my tongue (who has done absolutely nothing wrong in this whole adventure) is working hard to adjust to reduced or no salt meals.  Seriously, I came from a family that salted everything - even before tasting.  I salted things like bagels.  I was the salt queen.  No longer. That adjustment is actually coming along fairly well.  A few weeks ago, my husband wanted hotdogs for dinner.  My day had been very busy and my energy was low, so we both had hotdogs.  Wow.  That was eyeopening. Those dogs were very salty.Beyond the taste, all food needs to be balanced with an eye to the big four: Potassium, Phosphorus, Salt and Protein - not to forget the other supporting players of Carbs and Fats.  Juggling those elements for every ingredient can make your head spin.  Thankfully I found an “app for that.”  It is called Cronometer and it took all the leg work out of totaling up those elements from the foods I log into it.  Thank God for technology.  But be careful what you ask for.  I discovered that although I am eating a more plant based diet, I still am getting too many carbs and too much fat. I am even getting too much salt on some days (the hotdog day aside.) So off I go on another quest to find other foods and  combinations that are better.  It never ends.  Gone are the days when I could walk into a farmer's market and joyfully know that absolutely EVERYTHING there was healthy for me.  Sadly, that is no longer entirely true.  Spinach, kale and dark leaf plants are potassium rich.  Got to be careful with those - because “rich” in this context is bad - not good.  And mellons and bananas, my very favorite and safe fruits, are also very very potassium rich.  A single serving - maybe once a day.  And be sure you know what a “single serving” is ... it is less than you might think. So so many elements to considered and understood and adopted.Anyway,  I am learning and adjusting and most importantly, persisting ... because this isn’t just until I loose a few pounds - it is forever. I am not going to grow a second kidney.  My liver, once healed can be made sick and enlarged again if not careful. But the weight loss has been a pleasant side effect - like positive reward for making all this effort.  In fact, since last year I have lost 23 pounds.  Ten pounds were from Weight Watchers over 6 months.  Pretty uninspiring.  But between May and July I lost another 13 pounds.  That was all due to plant based eating.  And I am still losing, but just more slowly.  The weight loss was welcomed - and I am within 4 pounds now of a normal BMI which is important to my health. So that is all good.  I will be happier with this new way of eating when I have a selection of successful plant based food items to prepare without effort.I sincerely hope that at my next lab test, we will see some appreciation from Leona and Lennie.I will make a sincere effort to not let another month pass before blogging again!  Maybe with pictures next time.Cheers all."},
{"title": "Just checking in", "date": "Tuesday, July 11, 2023", "text": "Here I am, 3+ weeks out from surgery, heading towards 4 weeks and doing great (well ... great-ish).  My incision is healed, I can drive again, walk as much as I want and do most things by myself.  That is the “glory\" of laparoscopic surgery with robot assist!  While I am still limited in lifting stuff and I can't vacuum this very dirty house yet (which only bothers me - not my husband - because he is blind), I am feeling very fortunate to be living in an area of the country where this advanced technology and skilled surgeons using this technique are readily available to me.  Add that to my very supportive family, and you have a near perfect experience.But it is “near” perfect only.The remaining kidney has been a little slow in picking up the pace of its job.  The kidneys are very hard working little organs that don't get enough credit for the work they do - until they don't and then you got trouble. In fact, you would never know there was a problem until you are in serious trouble.  My remaining kidney (I will call her Leona going forward - 😁 in honor of my mom, her middle name, who suffered with kidney disease most of her life and died of kidney failure and dementia), Leona was expected to take a dip in her functioning, according to the surgeon right after surgery.  And she did dip by about 20 points off normal function.  Two weeks later she had dipped another 5 points.  hmmm.  But some other values were abnormal and my surgeon asked me to make a few adjustments to my eating and 4 days later I repeated the lab work.  Previous abnormals were corrected but Leona was now down about another 5 points ... treading very close to levels of kidney failure.Hey ... what gives, Leona!!!But my surgeon and my internist both were ok with the values, so who am I to argue.   My own research indicates that kidneys are slow to adjust to change and that Leona could take months, maybe a year or more, to reach a level that is normal for me.  In the meantime, I have to eat healthy (well ... I will have to eat healthy the rest of my life, of course,) drink a lot of water every day and get various labs and diagnostic tests to track Leona’s progress.  And while I wait, I feel pretty good.  I have to remind myself that all is not yet back to normal and won’t be for some time.  But to look at me - I am good!And I think I mentioned that they also discovered that I have an enlarged liver.  Today I saw my GI doctor and we had quite a chat.  They will be tracking this liver now.  And, of course, there is a diet for that liver (that is somewhat different from the kidney diet that I must also follow) and that discussion resulted in a referral to a speciality nutritionist who can help me sort through both conditions.  I’ll table that discussion for another post - after I see her in a few weeks.  My GI doc said that enlarged fatty livers are a quiet pandemic in our country due to SAD - the Standard American Diet.  It is known that 30% of our population has this condition and there are probably another 10-20% who have it and don’t know they have it.  She said she even has it!  Without diet and exercise intervention the condition can develop into scarring on the liver and lead to cirrhosis ... and eventually liver failure.  An special MRI test called an Elastography has been ordered.  It will look for any scarring or cirrhosis.  She feels pretty sure my liver is ok for a number of reasons - one of which is the normal contours have not changed - it is just too big.  A good sign.  That test won’t happen until September when I am entirely healed.I haven’t come up with a good name for my liver yet.  I am open to suggestions. 😃So that is my current status.  I’ll be back sooner rather than later - I have many many pictures on my phone of stuff I wanted to post to the blog. It has just been a very busy time.Talk again soon."},

{"title": "Day 5 - Post Surgery", "date": "Tuesday, June 20, 2023", "text": "I am now on the “other side” of the kidney tumor surgery.  I am down to only one kidney, and the tumor - kidney duo is gone.  The whole process has gone exactly as described.  I am healing fast.  The pain is much reduced.  And as of yesterday, my energy levels have started to return.  I don’t need naps if I got a good night’s rest.  I have very few limitations - except that I should not lift heavy objects (they never gave a number of pounds but I am erring on the safe side and handling only light stuff) and I shouldn’t mow the grass.”  Ha! I am safe there - in a condo community we hire folks to mow the lawn. I can climb steps and I can even vacuum if I am using a stick vacuum.  Obviously this minimally invasive laparoscopic robot assisted surgery delivers on it promises of a fast recovery with less pain.Two weeks from my surgery I will follow up with the surgeon and get my pathology results.  There was no new info given post surgery because based on pre surgery test imaging there were no surprises found when they did the surgery.  But microscopically my kidney cancer story may take a different path - and Oncology may be recommended.  In fact, she has mention that possibility at every interaction we have had.  I feel pretty sure she has been subtly prepping me for that possibility.Based on my own research, if kidney cancer has spread - even microscopically, it is no longer treated initially with Chemotherapy and radiation therapies.  The current preferred treatment is Immunotherapy.  Immunotherapy is the use of medicines to boost a person’s own immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells more effectively.  It is sort of the opposite of suppression immunotherapy used in transplant patients to prevent rejections of the implanted organs.But that all is a future topic.  Right now I am only crossing bridges I haven’t come to - I need to focus for the near future celebrate the fact I am tumor free.  And I am very very pleased about that.Just know that I am doing well right now - physically and emotionally.  I’ll get back again after the surgical follow up."},
{"title": "Fast Approaching ...", "date": "Monday, June 12, 2023", "text": "Sorry this update is delayed in coming. The surgery is this Thursday (OMG so soon) and (unless I have beaten down my true feelings on this), I am doing fine.Actually I feel great physically as well.  In fact, I am thinking of asking the surgeon to give me a picture of this tumor that has caused all this hub-bub because other than all the doctors' visits and testing (and the results, of course), I feel no different.  I could make a case that it is all a sham!    Well, not really. I believe everything I have been told, but a small part of me still wants a picture.  Of course, in the result of the last test - the MRI -  there is more going on in my abdomen beyond that tumor.  When you start poking around in the body of a 76 year old person - you are bound to turn up something. It showed 2 things:  1) small multiple cysts in my kidneys and my liver - and 2) some liver enlargement.  The enlargement was described by the radiologist as \"fatty liver.”   Well, crap!  So I did my web searches on cysts and fatty liver, and it raised even more questions.  Does this ever end!!  I have so many questions about this new development (well “new to me” development as I have probably been carrying around a tumor and cystic organs for some time.)Nothing they found, however, changes the surgery.  We are a “go” for that.  I did discover that fatty liver can be found in 30% of Americans on SAD - the Standard American Diet - and most don’t even know they have liver problems until liver damage starts to show up in blood work. Guess I am “lucky” I discovered this problem while looking at the tumor, which was discovered while looking at my GI system!!! *sigh*  Ranting over now.  I found the diet recommended for turning fatty liver around - and healing the liver.  I started that diet a week or two ago.  It is basically just a very healthy diet of veggies and fruit, limited complex carbs and no added sugar or salt, and lean proteins like fish, chicken, turkey and soy, no dairy, no red meat, and no alcohol. Boring, but fine with me if it keeps me around another 15 years.  And my internist will be very pleased if I can stick to that diet.  I found a bright spot in that diet!  Coffee is good for the liver.  I feel like I was just given a lollypop!!  (A lollypop without sugar, of course.)  But questions still remain on how I got here and if this is related in any way to my strong family history of Polycystic Kidney Disease.  I see a Nephrologist in September.  The first appointment is for an hour!  Good, because by then I will have so many questions he might not get time to answer if it is less than an hour.That’s the story so far.  I am eager to get this tumor out and start healing.  I will admit to a bit of nerves mostly because I am the oldest I have ever been for a surgery (and I have had a few surgeries.). They were all successful with no complications so I need to focus on that.And have I mentioned my amazing kids (who are not really kids being in their 40s.). Since I will not have my husband’s assistance at the hospital or at home due to his disability, my son is taking me to the hospital and will be the designated family member to remain until the surgery is over.  Over the weekend we discussed departure times and other details ... and he said, \"Oh, and mom, the night after surgery I will be right across the street.”  Me ... looking blankly. - what??? I had an instant vision of him outside the hospital standing on the sidewalk until visiting hours opened up again. (I know, crazy mother thoughts.)  He went on.  \"I have booked a room right across the street in a hotel.\"  Well ... I really didn’t know what to say at first.  I was so touched.  And it stunned me even more to realize I took comfort in the knowledge that he wouldn't be far.  Maybe I am more anxious than I am willing to admit.  And then there is my daughter who will come to be with her dad the night after my surgery - and who plans to stay with us both until I am able to putter around for myself.   And my sister who plans to show up with meals for us the day I get discharged.Truly, I am bursting with pride at the adults my “kids” have become.  They are the very very best things I have done with my life. My sister, who has been through much much more than this, dealing with the polycystic kidneys she inherited from our mom, cooking for us (which my husband is secretly looking forward to because my sister is a great cook.). I really do struggle with accepting all of that help while at the same time I am so very grateful for it.Next time I blog - I will be cancer free!  See you guys on the other side."},
{"title": "A break in the action", "date": "Tuesday, May 23, 2023", "text": "The last few weeks have been a roller coaster ride.  This week is an appointment free week.  As much as I really want to move forward, I am glad for a break in the action.  I need to get my brain and emotions in sync.But while I am on a mini-high right now, my CT results came back: normal for my age.  Bones show age related degeneration and some arthritis only!  Beautiful words.  A month ago I would have fretted over those results. Not now.  It is all about perspective!  Now I want nothing more than to be “normal for my age.”   (But I do have to keep up those leg and back exercises.)Other thoughts have been taking up space in my brain.?? A Preferred Cancer List ??To start ... if you have to get cancer, I guess kidney cancer is pretty high on the “preferred list” if there is such a ridiculous thing as a “preferred list” for cancer.  It can be cured with the swipe of a surgical knife.  You have a back up kidney, and one kidney is actually plenty to live a normal life. Renal Cancer doesn’t spread fast.  My tumor is large so it is hard to know how long it has been sitting in there with plans to spread its wings.  Still - the feedback so far is that it has not spread. Even with all those positives (?), it IS a Cancer!  It can hide for a long time and it can spread. I got lucky - it was found, but I want it out (... like yesterday.).  If it has spread I am ready for Oncology (... like yesterday). Give me those drugs.  Give me that radiation.  Sign me up for all the weapons of medical “war” that science has to offer (... like the day before yesterday!!) Can you tell that patience is not one of my virtues?The Real MeThe real me - (the \"cut it out, poison it, burn-it-to-the-ground\" me) - that me hasn't changed one bit since I was in my 20s. I am an Aries** through and through. Stubborn, hard-headed,  opinionated, etc.  My kind of personality is hard to be around sometimes!  But in a “fight”, it is good to be an Aries.  For example - I experienced a cancer scare 6 months after the birth of my son when I was 26.  I discovered a lump in my breast.  My doctor said I was too young for cancer.  (I bet they don’t say that any more.). Back in 1974 you entered the hospital the night before for a biopsy and you signed away your breast the night before surgery, because if the biopsy came back positive ... as you lay on the surgical table, they did the mastectomy before you woke up.  That night before the biopsy, a nurse came to my hospital room to prep me for surgery.  She asked me how I felt about maybe waking up with only one breast.  She was young - like me - but I remember telling her, “They can take the whole right side of my body, if it saves my life.  I have a son to raise.”  “Good answer,” she responded.  It wasn’t cancer then.  It is cancer now. I feel exactly the same today. My Aries traits will serve me well.  The Me I Know I have worked in medicine most of my professional life - administratively mostly, but enough to know the short comings and strengths of medicine and the people who make these life and death decisions.  I am not in awe of doctors. I greatly respect their knowledge and training, but know they are people just like me, and they can make mistakes in judgement just like me.  Mistakes get made when you are over worked and fatigued.  I believe medical care and decisions should be a team event: the patient or their advocate and the doctor.  I was my mother’s advocate for 8 years and many of my interactions with medical professionals were confrontational because some physicians didn’t function well as team players.  I challenged some decisions (or lack of them,) demanded further explanations until I understood, asked about options not offered, and made damn sure that my mom got the very best of what modern medicine had to offer while minimizing difficult procedures that would not benefit her in her fragile health state.  It was a balancing act.  I often felt like a warrior with the sword and shield on her behalf. They had to go through me to get to her and I did speak my mind without a filter.  (Aries ... another trait.) I was not out to make friends (and often didn’t), but I did get what she needed.   The Me I Don’t KnowThis whole month I have wondered just where that “warrior” person has gone.  I am not good at being the patient and the advocate simultaniously for myself.  My husband isn’t good at this either.  Of course, two BIG differences between my mom and I are that she had dementia and could not speak for herself, and she had fragile health and would not benefit from unnecessary testing that would lead to a surgery that we would not do.  I have no mental limitations, and I am younger and healthier than she was - so I should be able to speak on my own behalf.  Mom needed an advocate. I should not.  BUT it is hard work to think and evaluate when your head is spinning.  Hard, hard work.  If this whole experience goes past Urology into Oncology, maybe by then the shock will have lowered a bit - and the “Aries” me will start to show up more frequently on my own behalf. Knowledge Is PowerFinally, I have a cousin who has been an RN for a very long time. Currently she is a Nurse Navigator and has experience working for patients as they wade through the medical establishment in pursuit of care.   In sharing this news with her, she sent me the NCCN Guidelines for Patients - Kidney Cancer Guidelines.  This very informational book created for patients provides all the details related to kidney cancer and the questions for doctors.  When I first got it - I was in the “I have a cyst” phase of my journey.  I did open it and began reading various sections - but as I skimmed through it - it made me a bit uncomfortable.  I was uncomfortable enough to close it thinking ... this is serious stuff. I set it aside because I had a cyst - not a tumor.  No need to upset myself.The “I have a tumor” phase has begun.  Time to start reading and getting familiar with exactly what I have.  My personal comfort level now has no bearing on this situation.  I need to be armed with information.  This could be a “war” and my Aries self needs to know the enemy!  ** I am not a believer in Astrologic signs.  But I can’t ignore the similarities between my personality and the Aries traits. I remember a conversation I had with my daughter on this subject.  She observed just how much her Astrologic sign matched her personality.  I read up on my sign.  I didn’t like all the “bull-headed” observations of the Aries Ram sign.  I observed that I wasn’t all those things!  She just smiled and said, “Oh mom, you are such an Aries!” 😂😂"},
{"title": "Get It Done Mode - Day 2, 3, 4, etc", "date": "Sunday, May 21, 2023", "text": "Day 1 was May 2.  It’s been about 20 days since that time.  Every day since Day 1 has been a blur.Soon after Day 1 I saw my GI Nurse Practitioner.  The realization that she found something that would have gone undetected for a few more years was not lost on me.  I thanked her over and over for her persistence and dedication even if this wasn’t what she (or I) was looking for. She confirmed many of the same kidney mass facts I already had googled.  If the kidney mass is a tumor, there is a 90% chance of malignancy.  Kidney tumors grow slowly so this little hidden “tag-along” has probably been there for years.  They are slow to metastasize and when they do they typically show up in the lungs and bones.  My CT scan of the chest showed normal lungs and no involvement of the lymph nodes that could be seen.  If the tumor is removed before it spreads, that is The Cure.  100% Cure.  No chemo or radiation.  No follow up treatment at all except to monitor the other kidney and to watch for a future cancer.  She said based on my family history this could very well be a cyst.  When I reported this conversation to my husband, the look of relief on his face was marked.  I realized he was carrying a great deal of worry behind of calm exterior.  I, again, repeated my belief that all would be well. Yet, every time I said this, I would silently add a little plea to who whoever was listening - “...and please make it so.” At home I was busy setting up appointments.  I needed a Urology appointment within 2 weeks.  I scheduled a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis.  I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor to make sure he was in the loop on the new information. I had a boat load of personal commitments that needed to be moved or cancelled.  Priorities shifted.I saw my primary doctor.  He repeated everything that I had already heard and researched.  He said additionally that the likelihood of a malignant tumor on my kidney at my age is very rare.  It is seen more commonly in younger individuals.  Block by building block the existence of a cyst became very real in my mind.  Cysts are watched, not surgically extracted.  Cysts are not typically life threatening unless there are a bunch and they begin to impact the function of an organ.  In my brain, this mass had to be a cyst.Then it was my Urologists turn to tell me what I already knew.  My husband came to this appointment.  He usually does not go with me to appointments.  Trips into strange places are tough on him because he is blind.  But I invited him to go to this appointment because this appointment was different.  How different I wasn’t sure, but a small part of me failed to let go of the tumor idea. I needed another pair of ears with me.  Normally he would pause and hem and haw and maybe finally say, ok.  He quickly responded, “Yes.”  He knew this appointment was different too.The Urologist walked into the room, sat down and got right to the point.  “I’ve looked at your CT scan and this is not a cyst.  This is a tumor!  Tumors have a 90% chance of being malignant. The fix is to go in and take out the tumor, the kidney and surrounding lymph nodes.  A biopsy is not done in advance.  A tumor must come out regardless of malignancy or the lack of it.  If surrounding tissues are clear, you are cured. Your kidneys look good.  No sign of polycystic disease.  You should do very well with one kidney.  You will be followed by a Nephrologist post surgery to maximize the function and health of the remaining kidney.  Questions.”   Don’t get me wrong.  I much prefer the direct, to-the-point approach.  And everything she said I knew from my research regarding kidney tumors.  But I had a cyst.  Except I didn’t.Numbness.  I remember asking a few questions and getting answers.  When I asked, my husband had no questions.  I remember his face.  Tight and guarded. I did him no favors talking up the cyst.  She asked me a number of questions which I answered.  She changed my CT of the abdomen and pelvis to an MRI of the same area - with contrast, of course.  We scheduled a mid-June surgery date before we left the office.  It was neatly wrapped up and all that was missing was a bow.We got in the car and I said - “Well that is not what we were hoping for.”  He said. “No.”   The ride was so quiet.  I was glad for that since I was driving and I needed to focus on driving.  At home he had a chance to gather his thoughts and he offered to help me in anyway he could.  We both knew his physical help was very limited by his disability.  But he would “be there” for moral support.  In my life I have prided myself on not needing anyone’s moral support.  I am stubborn and strong and able to follow my own path regardless of the actions or opinions of others.  A true Aries! But this time might just be different.Once I got home and the fog lifted, I realized there were 2 questions she asked that I answered wrong.  Does cancer or kidney tumors run in my family?  I said no.  In fact a kidney mass was found in my mom in her 80s. At the time her health was fragile and we declined any further testing because we would take no action on the results of the tests. Do you have back pain?  I said no.  But I do have back pain and it is on the left side and lately it has become very much more noticeable and constant.  So I corrected those answers with the Urologist and she order a Nuclear Medicine Full Body Scan.  That test was yesterday.  It looks at your bones and looks for “hot spots” that may indicate the presence of abnormal cell growth.  I am now 24 hours out since that test with no urgent phone call from my provider.  I do hope that is a good sign.Preop office visits with my primary and the Urologist are next and I will come armed with my questions for the Urologist.  And the dreaded MRI ... it is a topic for another post.  If you have ever had a MRI I am sure you can guess why I am dreading this test.  But enough for today."},
{"title": "Another Chapter - Day 1", "date": "Saturday, May 20, 2023", "text": "Yes, it has been since October 2022 since I last visited my own blog and during that time I have wondered if I really have reach the end of my blogging journey.  But there is something so final about closing this down and saying goodbye to all this written history ... no matter what the reason.  During the unintentional blog break some health related events have been developing - slowly like the beginning of an ocean tsunami that is just a small swell out on the ocean but gathers speed and height the closer it gets to shore.  And once on shore .... well ... you know the rest.It occurred to me that my personal thoughts on these health developments are best not expressed to my  family because my goal with them is to minimize the whole event so that worry does not overtake them (like it does for me in quiet times).  I want them to only focus on the positive.  This is just a bump in the road to get past and all will be well at the end. And if a family member does stumble upon these postings, please allow me and any other family member the allusion that you aren’t aware of these posts. I love you all dearly, but I can handle only so much reality at a time.  My personal thoughts need to get out somewhere! The last time I dumped my deepest concerns anywhere was my time as caregiver for my mom - 8 years of my life that birthed this blog years ago.  Maybe this is the place I need to go now.To start with the end (the current end as of this date as this is still developing) ... I have been diagnosed with Renal Cancer.  There is a large tumor on my left kidney that showed up by accident while being evaluated for GI complaints.  The CT scan was the last in a long line of tests started back in the fall of 2022 for GERD - ordinary innocuous acid reflux that was proving hard to resolve.  Just like the “photo bomb” pictures you see on Facebook and laugh about, this sizable tumor peaked its head out in the last shot of a CT scan of my chest.  The only difference was - it wasn’t funny.  The “accidental” nature ... my GI Nurse Practitioner was ordering the CT scan of my neck and before she handed the order to me, she stopped and said, “Have you ever had a CT scan of your chest?”  \"Nope ... no CT scan of anything!”  \"Ok, let’s just add that on to the order.”  Almost an after thought.  Sure why not, I thought - I am laying on the table there anyway.  Let’s take a look at everything!!You know you are in trouble when you complete a diagnostic test, arrive home and 2 hours later you are getting a call from your medical provider - eager to talk with you.  Her phone number came up on my phone as “unknown” so I didn’t answer it.  She rang back again, and I didn’t answer it again, but this time she left a voice mail message.  I remember saying to my husband when I picked up the message - “Oh this can’t be good.  You never get medical results this fast.\"And it wasn’t good.  A large mass was partially seen along with part of my kidney on the CT scan aimed at my chest.  After the call I remember feeling numb!  Very very numb.  Like this was happening to someone else.  In hindsight, I think the numbness was my body protecting me from panic. For about 2 hours I lived in that state.  She ordered a CT of my abdomen and pelvis and provided a referral into Urology - to be seen within 2 weeks.  She left me with a single lifeline to hang onto.  “Now this might be a large cyst. We can’t tell from this image. We need more studies.”  When the fog of numbness began to lift - a cyst made the most sense.  My liver had some cysts (but no one was concerned about that.). My family history was littered with polycystic kidney disease and although I tested negative in the 90s for that, maybe that test was wrong.  Yes, it most likely was a cyst rather than a tumor.  I began to feel better. All would be well.  I had a number of family members to tell.  Although sending an email about such a topic isn’t ideal, that is what I did.  I couldn’t go through multiple telephone calls rehashing this same info fracturing my fragile “ok state of mind” in the retelling.  I did call my kids, however.  They seemed to handle the info more calmly than I was feeling inside - but maybe the 'numb thing' is hereditary, and they were a few steps behind me in reacting.  I made sure they had the same life line I did - this most likely is a cyst.  Look at our family history!! We really don’t know what we don’t know.  No need for concern.  All will be well.All will be well.  Words I have lived my whole life using.  Words I prayed to God now would be true as I said them to the closest beings to me on the face of this earth - my children and my husband.  I did my best to make them believe those words.And at the end of Day 1 - I made myself believe them too!"},
{"title": "Checking In", "date": "Wednesday, October 19, 2022", "text": "It has been 2 months since I published a post to my blog.  And I have been absent from reading blogs.  My apologies to my readers who visit and wonder where I am.Gaps in my blogging have happened a number of times previously since I started writing in 2009.  I will admit this is the most uninspired I have ever been since I have started.  September and October were pretty busy with a variety of commitments.  The chances of getting a blog post published were pretty low.  So maybe that is all that is going on. Does that mean I am quitting?  No - I cannot honestly say I am done with blogging.  And I still take pictures to save and share on my blog at some point.  But I have clearly slipped into a different level of participation for the near future.But to give you a few snippets of what has passed this way while I have been gone from my blog.COVIDI finally managed to catch covid in September.  I was pretty bummed, as I am sooo careful but luckily I got tested early and got the “magic pills” - the antiviral medication - in time to turn the infection off rapidly.  My husband caught it from me and he also got the antiviral medication quickly as well.  I struggled with some lingering fatigue for a week or two, but that finally lifted.  I feel very fortunate that I got this pesky and dangerous virus after medical science figured out ways to minimize and manage it. THE ESK REQUESTSo this conversation happened during a recent visit - while I was knitting ...Esk:  Grandma is that for me?Grandma:  No, Esk.  This is a shawl and little girls don’t wear shawls.Esk: Grandma, will you make me a sweater?Grandma: (sputtering and surprised) Sure, Esk!  I thought maybe you had out grown ... uhh ... or maybe lost interest or whatever ... uhh, .... so what color?Esk: (and Grandma at the same time) Pink and Purple I set aside the two “promises” I made to myself this year: 1) finish the 5 works in progress I had sitting idle for too long and 2) avoid purchasing any new yarn because my stash is too big.  Unfortunately there is a significant lack of pink and purple in my stash, so yarn was purchased. And I launched into project number 6 - a sweater for Esk.CLEANING OUTIn an effort to jump start my general malaise, I fell back on a tried and true method of refocusing my perspective: paring down my stuff.  Downsizing always makes me feel better.  Expanding the space around me by reducing the clutter usually sparks enthusiasm for other endeavors.  So far it hasn’t sparked much of anything, but it has felt good to exercise that “enough” muscle - getting my belongings and life expectations down to “enough.” CHANGE OF SEASONSI am happy the weather is finally cooling down.  Of the 4 seasons, summer is my least favorite. I will miss that fresh produce that comes with late summer - but that is pretty much it.  Heat and humidity are not my friends.  Love that January time after the hubbub of Christmas has passed and the really cold weather sets in and a chance of a winter snow storm increases.That’s all for now guys.  I can’t promise when I will be back again.  But I will try to keep in touch with bloggers whose commenting function allow me to leave a comment."},
{"title": "The Wood Puzzle", "date": "Saturday, August 13, 2022", "text": "I wanted to try a wood puzzle so I put a request on my public Amazon Wish List for a wood puzzle.  I didn’t want any just wood puzzle.  I wanted pictures of my 3 original grand dogs who are all gone.  My daughter must have seen it and made it happen.  Here’s a better shot of the front.  The 3 dogs are (clockwise from the biggest picture)Grimace, the Pug, Grimace and Milo, the French BulldogMeathead, the English Bulldogand Grimace, Meathead, and Milo.And I love those 3 dogs still!  Miss them every single day.But the real interesting part that others might be interested in is the back of the puzzle.  It really is an interesting and fun puzzle.

{"title": "Tate: Then and Now - and some Bull Dog Advice", "date": "Wednesday, August 10, 2022", "text": "THENRemember this adorable face? So many wrinkles.And I think I showed this picture as well.  Check out that half blue/half tan eye!  He still has that.  He seemed to fill out some of those wrinkles. He is about a month older in this picture.Such a sweet face.NOWWell, now 5 months later - at 7 months of age ... here is the current face.  It is a face that has matured some.  Still cute as can be.He is only 7 months old.  He is not finished growing. From my previous experience of watching English Bulldogs grow, the head increases in size at the end of their growth so we will see what the few months bring. At present he weighs 37 pounds.  Compact.  He definitely has the bulldog tooth pose down pat.ADVICE FROM A BULLDOG GRANDMOTHERIf you think you might want a bulldog or you know someone who might want a bulldog, you need to read on.  I feel people should be fully and honestly informed of what owning a bulldog can cost.   If I can educate even one person prior to purchasing an expensive bully (responsible breeders can charge from $4,000 to $10,000 for a puppy) and help them understand that the purchase price is just the beginning of your spending experience (you need very deep pockets to keep most of them healthy,) then I will have helped this breed stay in their forever homes. People give up these dogs because they can’t afford the medical bills.  How sad for the bulldog who had absolutely no control over their breeding and inherited health issues ... and now are surrendered to a shelter or rescue group - or worse yet, euthanized.Anyone who has owned an English Bull Dog knows that health issues are pretty common with them.  In fact, I would guess that a life long perfectly healthy bully is fairly rare.  My daughter has pet insurance for Tate as she did for her previous French Bulldog, Milo.  Bulldog health insurance is at least twice the cost of insurance for a normal mixed breed dog.  The medical history of these bully breeds are reflected in the high cost of their pet insurance. Just one example from my own family:  My daughter had a French Bulldog before Tate. Milo lived a long life, dying around 12 years of age of pneumonia, but for all those years he had excellent quality (and expensive) health care.  He was well cared for and at his death - other than gray hair on his muzzle and paws, he looked at strong and fit as he did years before.  My daughter spared no expense because she loved him dearly and accepted the full responsibility for his health.  But Milo had back surgery at the age of 6 - without it he would have lost the use of his rear legs within 2 years.  And before the back surgery, he had to have nasal and throat surgery to correct the problems related to his brachycephalic airways (“pushed in face” problems typical for English Bulldogs, Frenchies, and Pugs.) That surgery assured that he would have no problems recovering from anesthesia after a surgery. And before those two surgeries, he needed an MRI to clearly identify the back issue for the surgeon.  She had pet insurance but it covered only 80%.  The grand total for all of that was close to $15,000.  Yes, Fifteen Thousand Dollars.  Milo also had skin allergies that he took medicine for his whole life and GI problems that required expensive prescription dog food. He also saw a veterinary ophthalmologist for an eye infection that would not heal - he had months of care for that condition.  I do not exaggerate when I express the commitment my daughter had to give him the best quality of life she could.In talking with pet owners who showed an interest in Franchies while waiting with Milo in a Vet’s office one time, I warn them that Frenchie medical care can be expensive.  Typically these folks who have never owned a bully nod in a knowledgable way saying ... \"yes, yes. - all veterinary care is so expensive now-a-days” as they look down at their own pet that is not a bully.  Then I give them the medical litany of Milo’s history and you can see their eyes glaze over with the realization of what “expensive” actually means in a pure bred bulldog with problems! Bulldogs are really are a luxury if they are provided proper medical careAt the age of 7 months, Tate has started his own medical saga.  He had the normal neutering but he also had a small hernia that needed to be repaired.  Then his right eye had a eruption of Cherry Eye - a large swelling of the tear duct gland in the eye.  It seemed to come and go, but then it didn’t go.  And his left eye erupted as well.  So my daughter arranged an appointment with a Veterinary Eye doctor.    Yes, it could be corrected,  it can come back, and this condition is apparently inherited.  She scheduled the surgery, and now, $4,000 later his eyes are back to normal. But his medical chart is off to a fast gallop before his first birthday. We are hopeful that this ends his medical issues, but we aren’t being naive either.None of the problems mentioned are exclusive to bulldogs, but the frequency of these problems is more the issue. I won’t get into the problems of irresponsible breeders, or the terrible problem of over pet population and the high rates of euthanasia because of it.  Adopting a specific kind of pet is a personal choice - but it should be an educated decision and you should have the commitment (and the money) if you choose a bully breed.With that all said, our family LOVES all our pets.  Our pets are family members and my kids (and now me) LOVE these bully breeds a lot. All of them.  They are wonderful companions ... funny, inquisitive, and curious, rambunctious, couch potatoes at maturity and, above all, stubborn. But many come with inherited conditions and pet owners really need to be aware.  If you take a bully into your heart, you take everything that happens to the bully into your life and your wallet.  I agree the same can be said of all pets, but I guarantee, a bully breed will hit your wallet much harder.   Our family has adopted our fair share of shelter pets with no pedigree and our commitment to them is just the same.  So the point of this Grandma Advice was not to prize one choice over another.  Just be sure to do your homework before you adopt any pet - know what you are getting and what will be expected for you for your pet to be happy and healthy.  It is worth it!  Every cent.  They give back more love and companionship than you could possibly imagine.  But if it is not for you, I get it and respect that decision as well."},
{"title": "Thank You", "date": "Sunday, August 7, 2022", "text": "Thank you for the kind comments and observations to my most recent post.  I am kind of stunned that my regular readers all commented.  I kind of expected that some would have moved on to other more active bloggers.  I have a camera full of pictures, taken with the idea of sharing - so I guess that means I am not quite ready to stop blogging.  😂😂😂I did make a discovery recently.  Looks like Blogger has finally deleted all my “email subscriptions” to the blogs I follow.  Don’t know when it happened, but I don’t get hardly any notifications in my Google Email In Box that a blog post has been published, and as a result I have missed a number of your postings.  Blogger warned us that would happen long ago and when it didn’t happen to me I just ignored them.  I am in the process of rebuilding my “follow” list on Blogger where I create my blog posts - in the Reading List option.  Truthfully I would love to put my blog on another platform, but I just can’t stand the thought of starting over and leaving behind this archive of blog posts.  My caregiver journey with my mom resides here and although it is buried deep in the past history of this blog, I know it is there even if it is no longer seen by anyone other than myself.  That experience was 8 years of my life and it is a major contributor to the person I am today.  I sometimes check back and remember - look at the pictures and generally just “visit” with mom ... so here I stay.Working on other posts.  Be back soon.Elaine"},
{"title": "Struggling ...", "date": "Tuesday, August 2, 2022", "text": "Ok, so I have been off the grid - again - not only off my blog but missing most of the posts of my blog friends.  Not good.Some of my personal disconnect has been related to a family issue.  A close family member has been very ill and waiting on a double organ transplant list for 2 years - not a topic I figured to cover here.  She got that transplant this summer (thankfully) and is slowly improving.  I don’t think I accurately calculated the personal impact of that situation.  It was a gnawing worry for quite some time that I underestimated and which finally came to a head.  She is now on the other side of that surgery - healing at an amazing rate and adjusting to the new demands on her life. We are a small family and loss of a family member is rare, so this whole transplant journey has been a tough road for all.  I spent much of those 2 years hoping for a miracle rather than the “fix” with a scalpel - a fix that appeared to be the only way to save her life.  At times the whole saga felt like a train speeding down the track with no way to stop - speeding to the end of cliff and when the tracks disappeared, you either crashed down the mountain or your train sprouted wings at the last minute and you could fly. Sometimes I need to remember to breathe deep - and remember - she is flying now!I have also been struggling with the idea of maybe not blogging.  I seem to have lost my mojo for this writing activity.  I still visit some blogs and comment on a few, but not enough to be really engaged. And I hate that because I have been blogging since 2009!  When I tackle the thought of stopping, I always come to the same conclusion ... How can I give it up!  And I drift back again.  Not sure if I am drifting back yet.In the midst of my worries, I have also managed to be a bit of ADD personality - (Attention Deficit Disease) in my crafting life.   Jumping on the band wagon for a lot of stuff and accomplishing very little.  I have done this before and have come to the conclusion that I use that ADD behavior as a form of distraction from what is really weighing on me.  I then get a bit depressed and default to just sitting in my chair and knitting.  Ahh, knitting.  The thread that holds my life together no matter what is going on.  Anyway, that is where I am right now.  Not really gone and not really here either.Thanks for checking in.  PS: If you aren’t an organ donor, please consider it.  I am an organ donor.  I figure once I am done with this body, if there is anything of me that could save a life - it is theirs.  Being on the receiving end as our family has been - there is no greater gift you can give!"},
{"title": "Finished: The Patch Work Blanket", "date": "Thursday, June 2, 2022", "text": "As I mentioned in my previous post - I saved a lot of pictures of blog ideas to trigger future posts.  It is going to take some time to get caught up.  Each deserves it own time in the spot light.  If you missed the last post - be sure to check it out.  There is one very very cute bull dog featured there.  And he has almost entirely left the puppy stage.During the blog break I did finish the weave-it square blanket that I started about 15 years ago.  Weave-it squares are done on a special 4 inch square loom and the pins or nails are arranged in groupings of 3.  All the squares are sewn together just as you would sew together a granny square blanket.  Pictured above are 3 weave-it style looms.  The wooden one on the left was the first loom I purchased.  It took me a bit a research before I found someone who would make one.  There were original versions available on the secondary market but they often were expensive as they also qualified as antiques.  These looms were popularized in the 1930s through the 1950s.  Recently they are are experiencing a resurgence in popularity. The white loom on the right is a Zoom loom (a weave-it loom by another name) manufactured currently and has some comfort design elements.  But it works the same as the wood loom.  The clear loom on the bottom is also a weave-it style loom - only it is 8 inches square, but the nail placement is the same - groups of three.  You might remember this picture from a previous post.  A collection of squares - some sewn together and some not.  And many not even made yet.Here it is finished and folded up.  It makes a perfect square.  I decided to put a border on this blanket using some of the colors to pull it all together.  At first I was going to make it with a one color border, but I couldn’t settle on the one color.I finally decided that 4 colors from the blanket - one for each side would look the best.All for corners and colors.As I was sewing the blanket together, I was not entirely satisfied with my seams.  Some of them looked very uneven and almost amateurish.  But try as I might, the seams were sometimes just messy to my eye. The pictures below show what I mean.  But despite the rough look of the finishing I couldn’t help liking it.  There was something about the finishing that was appealing and I couldn’t put my finger on it.  And then I remembered what the true meaning of “patchwork” was.United States[edit]Patchwork enjoyed a widespread revival during the Great Depression as a way to recycle worn clothing into warm quilts. Even very small and worn pieces of material are suitable for use in patchwork, although crafters today more often use new 100% cotton fabrics as the basis for their designs. In the US, patchwork declined after World War II but was again revived during the American bicentennial.The picture above shows that patchwork items were not entirely perfect and often the fabrics and colors used were not necessarily planned to coordinate perfectly.  And that was the feeling that my own weave-it blanket was echoing in my mind.  Not perfect but as a fully finished item - very appealing.The weaknesses of this blanket in my mind are:This blanket has many types of fiber contents and as a result will never be machine washable and dry-able.  Yarn was picked on color primarily. Because of the various types of yarns and the various colors - the seams would never look entire finished to a perfectionist eye - which sadly I seem to have.It has a ton of ends.  The problem in my mind is that each end represents a break in the fabric of the blanket - a weak point!  There are tons of weak points.But despite those weakness - I LOVE it.  I learned a whole lot about what yarns work with this weaving and what don’t. I LOVE that this used scrap yarn. It was yarn I loved from previous projects and couldn’t throw away the left overs - and finally, finally I got a chance to put them to good use.Perfection!!And already grabbed and used!!"},

Before May slips away and it is JUNE (yikes), I thought I would slip in this post.One of the main “eaters of time” is this little guy - my daughter’s new puppy, Tate.Here he is running toward the camera while my daughter, in a mask, watches on.He is a fortunate pup - gets to go to work with her occassionally. This picture was taken at her work.  He is a hogger of time.  A real attention “sponge.”  And such a cutie.A cutie picture!Note his left eye.  Exactly half blue for sure and half brown?, gray green? - not sure of the other color. A sponge picture.He is growing soooo fast.  One last picture that shows his evolving adult bulldog face!The latest picture I snagged of Tate from Facebook.He definitely has lost that puppy face and the grown up face is fast emerging. And yes,he had his mouth in the dirt in this picture.  Keeping him from eating stuffis a full time job.  Looks like he might keep that color in his left eye - it is half blue and half something else.He is finally old enough and vaccinated enough to go to doggie daycare.  As a result, I might not have him as much as I did this last spring.I may get more blogging time in now ... I certainly have a number of topics to catch up on.Hope all is well with you guys.  My family and I have still missed the bullet of Covid - shocking really since it seems to be cropping up around us in some of our friends.  Guess those vaccines and masks really do work.  Here’s hoping you guys are also missing this same bullet!Cheers!!"},
{"title": "And here he is!!", "date": "Wednesday, March 16, 2022", "text": "Last weekend my daughter and I drove down to southern VA,                     3 hours away from home - to pick up this little guy!!!Meet Tate, my daughter’s new English Bulldog puppy and my new grand dog!!It began the night before with me driving down to my daughter’s condo in DC.  This is a drive I have taken hundreds of times to pick up Milo, her previous dog, that we lost last July.  But this was during rush hour, it was dark and the traffic patterns were a bit different because of rush hour, and I haven’t driven in city traffic in 8 months. This trip is about 30 miles away - and mid-day it would take me about an hour, but this night it took about 90 minutes.  Just the state of traffic in our area.The next morning we traveled through snow and high winds.  Fortunately we were traveling south and driving out of the storm.  At some point it was just rain.We knew the storm was still hitting our area and we would need to deal with it on our return trip, but ...At the end of the road was this wonderful joining of pet owner and puppy.  And what a darling he is.We spent a short time getting his paper work and some initial instructions ... and then we turned right around and began the 3 hours trip back home.I had some serious bonding time with him in the back seat - and when he wasn’t sitting on my lap, he was looking out the window.  Everything was new to him.  He didn’t sleep a wink on the trip home. He was on an adventure.A seriously cute little guy.Arriving at home my daughter had set up his crate and his play area - with toys aplenty!  He was so cute running around and enjoying it all.She purchased a very important ’toy’ - a stuff white dog, with a heart beat you can feel and a heating pad insert that lasts 24 hours.  He sleeps on or beside it all the time.She even purchased a quilted jacket for him because the weather was so cold over the weekend and he seemed so cold outside, but the jacket was kind of big and the weather is now improving and he clearly had an opinion about wearing his new jacket.  The face says it all.What Tate doesn’t yet understand is that he will want for nothing!  He has landed in a family who values their pets as especially important family members.  Welcome to the family little guy.  You are in for a great life!"},
{"title": "The Aja Evolution - Chapter 72, Section M, Line Item 3, parts A through F   🤣 !", "date": "Friday, March 11, 2022", "text": "It is hard to wrap my brain around just how much adjustment time this little creature, called Aja, requires. But clearly we are not at the crest of that mountain top!  This coming May will be 2 years since a very scared, skinny, jittery and somewhat distrusting little orange female cat entered our lives.  And still there are little changes happening all the time - she is more comfortable in our home and more comfortable with us.  Sitting on my lap - and not sure she likes this camera “thing” I keep doing.😆Its all in the position of the ears!In the last few months she has been conquering the skill of lap sitting.  Usually in the evening, when all is quiet and I am watching TV (listening through ear buds - so the condo is very quiet), this little cat jumps up to the arm of my chair, waits patiently while I clear what I am doing from my lap, then steps carefully into the space I have made for her - and settles in for some petting time.  She can’t see I am taking another picture, so the earshave returned to normal.But she didn’t start out this comfortable.  It all began with her version of “drive by” - feet hitting the side of the chair and just as fast, feet pushing off in the opposite direction. Blink and you missed it!  After she figured out that no ‘condo monster’  swallowed her up,  she tried jumping into my lap with no warning ... sometimes landing on the top my open laptop - and then shooting off again, leaving me with a mess on whatever I was working on.  But I knew I was being tested (or maybe trained?)  I was calm.  She was persistent!  Next step in the goal of lap sitting, she started jumping on the arm of my chair and staring at me.  That was her signal that I must prepare her space (my lap.)  Once cleared she carefully settled in - tail whipping back and forth - letting me know she is “on the ready” for something.  Currently, she has stopped whipping her tail and she lets the petting begin.  I am also using these visits to acclimate her to the idea of my arms around her for an affectionate hug and a kiss on the forehead.  The first couple times I did this, she leaned away from me in the opposite direction.  Now she seems to accept it - because she knows I let go. At some point she just might enjoy it.  Its all baby steps with her! My husband, too, is working on his own schedule of 'taming the tiger.’  Several times a day he walks into the bedroom and sits on the side of the bed calling to her - and she comes!  Sometimes it is from the far end of the condo - on the run!  She jumps up on the bed and sits primly beside him as he gives her pets.  She obviously wants that time with him, because she always comes.  It is a short time but welcomed by both man and beast! And thank God for it -because those who read my blog almost 2 years ago, will remember, the first night she was with us, my blind husband stepped on her.  She was definitely NOT friends with him that night.  But like all our cats, over time she has figured out that he can’t see, so when he is on the move - so is she!She also comes out of the bedroom most afternoons and curls up on the floor in a safe place and naps!  We are hoping that someday she realizes that there are comfy chairs just one leap up where she can reside safely as well.  She has her own water fountain now that provides her moving filter fresh water whenever she wants it.  Yes, we bought her a pet water fountain when we discovered her trying to drink out of the bathroom faucets.  I quickly realized that I hardly ever saw her drink water out of her bowl (which was changed twice a day.). The moment we put the new water fountain down - she began taking long drinks.  That along with her healthy appetite - and she has put on some weight.  When May rolls around, I am sure we will be getting the first of the yearly Vet lectures about keeping an eye on her weight!  (Just like when I go to the doctor.) Ha! Regardless... her fur looks soft and shiny and no bones are showing!! Happy and healthy.  One good looking orange kitty!  She also has some favorite toys.  Cat Nip Paper Bag is a recent addition!  The bag smells yummy!I don’t see anything.  Maybe if I get closer!Ok!  Going in.  Taking one for the team!!She also has a crinkle toy that I have seen her bat around and carry in her mouth.  And laser lights are her very favorite toy of all.  I’ve even found a ball of yarn rolled across the floor - and not put there by me!Bottom line - she is doing great! And she continues to get her owners trained just the way she likes them!!Oh yes, we are going to get the weight lecture!!"},
{"title": "Weaving - I’ll be back!", "date": "Tuesday, March 8, 2022", "text": "I wish it wasn’t so, but I occasionally have projects that are started, not completed and are either given away or frogged. One of these 'not completed' projects is a weave-it blanket.  I will say this project has “staying power” because it has survived multiple downsizing events.  Every time I came across the bag filled with woven squares I said “I’ll be back” ... It never occurred to me even once that maybe I should just give up on this projectWell, now I am back!  And here is the story.Here are all the squares of this partially started blanket.Yes, it is a lot of pieces, and yes, it has a lot of ends to weave in! (Gobs and gobs of ends!)  And as you can see - some of the sewing has been done - but honestly, this has a ton of work left to do before it is complete.But seen up close the woven squares are so appealing to me, and different yarnsproduce different effects.  The plaid ones above are made with a single multi color skein of yarn.  It is fun to watch it develop.  Each plaid is different and there is no cutting the yarn to change colors.This weave-it blanket was started around 2009 - 2010 soon after I learned to make these little squares from Karen, (Happy One) of the Life is Good blog.  Karen introduced me to this weaving technique that she learned from her grandmother. At the time it wasn’t all that common a technique but in the 1930s and 1940s it was very popular.  When I started with this project you could buy weave-it looms on the secondary market - and with a little searching - I found someone who would make them “new.”  As the interest in weaving grew over the years, these little looms were “rediscovered” and have gained popularity among weavers, knitters, crocheters alike.The white loom is the Zoom Loom and the wooden loom is the oneI purchased off of Etsy. Both are weave-it style looms.On weave-it looms, the pins are in groupings of 3.At about the same time, I discovered the pin weaving looms made by Hazel Rose - looms where the pins are equally spaced and the weaving is done corner to corner. They come in various sizes (squares, rectangles, triangles, etc.) and fall under the umbrella term of continuous strand weaving - meaning that you create the warp of the project at the same time as you weave the project.  Very ingenious and half the work.Here are 6 squares made on a 12” Hazel Rose pin loom using the continuous strand weaving method.  They are not yet sewn together and many more are needed to complete the project - but with 12” squares there are many fewer ends toweave in and the sewing is much easier.  I am still experimenting with this project on patterns andif I will introduce a 3rd color.  I have researched weaving patterns that can be done on this loom as well.  So this project is still in its infancy.I once made a shawl for my mom using this 12 inch bias corner to corner loom.  It was pretty easy to sew 10-12 squares together and have a lovely shawl. A close up of that shawl can be seen in the center picture of the header of my blog. Unfortunately that shawl is no more and finding pictures of the shawl have proved unsuccessful.  My mom was in assisted living at that time and the shawl was snatched up by the center staff and put in the laundry - washed and dried in commercial sized washers and driers - and because it was 100% wool, it shrunk to the size of a placemat.  ☹️Weaving and I parted company for a few years, but I held on to most of the equipment and yarn.  Then my thumb started giving me problems and I was searching around for things to do with yarn that didn’t aggravate my hands!  Weaving started to pull me in once again, but only for the smaller simplistic looms - like the weaving-it and the Hazel Rose looms - that didn’t involved tons of preplanning and warping as a precursor to the fun part - which was the actual weaving.So weaving is back in my life again and it has been most gratifying to discover that these smaller pin looms have a dedicated following.  They can be found in Facebook groups, Ravelry groups, websites, and several dedicated blogs that focus on small hand held looms - and even books and patterns that are dedicated to wearable projects created using these cute little blocks.  In fact, it is very easy now to get a weave-it style loom that is not a 1930s antique.  The Zoom Loom has several wonderful little features that the antique style loom does not.Returning to the weave-it loom blanket (that I am now calling The Patch Work Blanket) - here is the first photo once again followed by the most recent photo that shows the current progress.Here are the squares that I found packed away in a bag from years ago.Only the far left column of squares have been completely sewn together.  Tons of strings still hang from all pieces of the work.And, yes, all those strings are a bit overwhelming.  But I havea plan for future weave-it projects to get passed the strings.  Almost all the squares have been sewn together and the strings for most of it have been woven into the piece.  I suspect this blanket is more than half done,but how much more needs to be done - I don’t know yet.I will return to this blanket and the pluses and minuses of doing a project like this in a future post.  I will also share some of the books and patterns that I have discovered that use this technique."},
{"title": "Comments - and a Public Service Awareness Campaign ", "date": "Saturday, February 26, 2022", "text": "Hello readers.I have a few new readers.  Since I like to visit and comment on the blogs of my readers ...  it is time once again to make a Public Service Announcement about Blogspot.com commenting pluses and minuses - the blogging platform you are visiting now that is used by me and many others.  The Pluses and the minuses  There are 2 methods of Blogspot.com comments: Embedded Commenting and PopUp Commenting.  PopUp Commenting seems to work consistently well for most readers - except that the blog owner cannot respond individually to each comment received.   I use PopUp Commenting.   Embedded Commenting does not work well for some us.  Comments ‘appear' to be submitted to the blog you are visiting, but they never show up.  No error message is provided to alert you to this problem.  And when I have back-tracked with the blog owner through a private email - just to confirm they got the comment - they report they never saw it.  Very frustrating for the visitor. If it works, however, it lets the blog owner reply individually to each visitor comment.  Very satisfying for all.What happened: A few years ago Blogspot made some adjustments to their blog platform.  It was at this time the commenting problem cropped up.  Embedded Commenting would only work if the blog I was visiting recognized me as “signed in” to Google.  I am always signed into Google, but the software just didn’t see it that way on some blogs.  I spent considerable time trying to get “signed in” in the eyes of some blogs.  I reported this issue to Blogger over a year ago and got no response - and, more importantly - no fix.  I gave up trying. While I understand that Embedded Commenting is the preferred method of accepting comments for most of us, it blocks some of the readers from leaving a comment.My Fix: My own personal work-a-round with some Embedded Commenting blogs is to send my comment to the blog owner's personal email.  My comment doesn’t show up on the owner’s blog, but it lets the blog owner know I visited.  I comment less often with that approach.  Lately, however, I have found that some blogs don’t provide an email.  I still visit, but I am totally invisible to the blog owner, with the exception that I probably count in your Blog Visitor statistics.Bottom Line:  Regardless of where you stand on how you receive comments on your blog, I just wanted to make readers aware of the problems some readers have with the Embedded Comments feature.  And I think twice about starting up with new blogs that use an Embedded Comments method. If I haven’t visited or commented on your blog, that may be the problem.Thanks for reading/listening!  Happy Blogging everyone."},

{"title": "A Repeat Puzzle", "date": "Wednesday, February 16, 2022", "text": "This is my next puzzle - The James Younger Gang offered by SunsOut Puzzles.  This is the only puzzle I kept from my previous puzzle life decades ago. It has survived many multiple downsize purgings of my belongings.   I love the picture.  I tried to find this puzzle on Amazon and it doesn’t appear to be for sale anymore. The first step facing me is the pieces sorting.  I typically sort by color and edge pieces first.I first noticed these pieces are non-traditional in shape.And the sizes of the pieces vary greatly.And I have a box full of those oddly shaped and oddly sized pieces.  Not sure if this will be easy or hard.  But the sorting step is completed now - and I am committed.  After all, how hard can it be since I have assembled this puzzle before?  (famous last words)  There are an awful lot of solid color pieces to this puzzle - so my normal brain process of checking the pieces against the picture for general location on the board won’t work for large sections of this puzzle.  In fact, I have specifically avoided puzzles that are a single color because I prefer using the picture side for reference as opposed to looking for specific shapes. This puzzle will be completed, however, no matter how hard it is because I have plans for it.Now that I have a dedicated puzzle space, I will glue this puzzle together, frame it and and hang it above my puzzle board.  This puzzle also will probably be the only puzzle I ever repeat. A kind of a “first” and “last” rolled into one. This should be interesting!"},

{"title": "Was it Sabotage?", "date": "Sunday, January 23, 2022", "text": "I know I am pretty dense about some stuff ... but I think I am actually now RETIRED!Yep!  I have looked all around me, in all the rooms, in the closets, under the furniture and  through my calendar ...  and I can’t escape the fact that there are no obligations or commitments hiding anywhere.  I am completely and totally retired!Imagine that!I suspect this is kind of an odd statement to make considering I haven’t held a paying job since 2007.  But as we near the end of this month, January 2022, I realize that after 15 years of stepping away from formal paid employment, I am retired. It took years to get here, but here I am!!What happened?  Why did it take so long and did I sabotage myself?When I left my last employment in 2007 they gave me a “retirement party.”  And there was no need to correct that assumption, because that was what I was doing.  Retiring!  I was only 59.  But my underlying reason for stopping work so early was my mom.  She was living with us and it was very hard for me to hold down a full time job and help her out all the other hours.   Turns out my mom became a 24/7 commitment as she was developing dementia. It wasn’t retirement for me. But it wasn’t exactly sabotage, because she needed help and I was able and happy to give it.When she died in December 2014, I thought now I will officially retire.  My commitment to mom taxed all of me more than anything else in my life.  I needed a break.  I just needed to close down her estate - and then I was done, done, done. But did I retire? Nope.With mom gone, it became overwhelmingly apparent that my increasingly visually impaired husband was at serious risk of falling on our stairs - and in a townhouse, there are a lot of stairs.  So from 2015 to 2016 I began the downsizing, taking on tasks my husband could no longer do because of his vision problems, “shopping” for a new and safer place to live, orchestrating the sale of our townhouse, organizing the move, and purchasing our current condo - not to mention the unpacking and settling in a new place and location.   I was 69 at the time of that move, and I used up every last ounce of myself.  Did I somehow sabotage myself over that year and half?  I don’t see how.  Now the person needing help was my husband - we needed to move and I had no choice but to take the lead.  In August of 2016 we moved into this condo.  I remember thinking “all I need to do is get us unpacked and settled and I will be retired.”  The list of obligations and commitments were at 0!  One day in January 2017 I was walking my daughter’s dog enjoying the feeling of lightness and I was approached by a resident with a measuring tape.  He asked me to help him by holding the measuring tape while he took measurements of a community project.  Ha!  I was thrilled to help, to make a friend of a neighbor, to become part of a community!!  Within 15 minutes he invited me to attend an informal meeting of the board happening in a few days.  He started talking ... you should join the board, you’d be great at it!!  God knows what he saw in me.  Was it my sparkling personality, or the way in which I competently held the measuring tape or .... was I just a warm body without 2 heads, and they needed a 5th board member - and there I was!!  Of course, I didn’t recognize any of that at the time - and I started thinking “Oh yes, this might be fun.”  (In that moment, the “Oh yes” moment,  I began to sabotage my retirement dreams!) Like a magnet I attended that meeting, got involved in community activities - crescendoing in a spell as a board member that ate up hours and hours (... and HOURS) of time every single week.  And this volunteer job felt very much like work without the benefit of a salary!   January 3 of this year, I stepped out of that board position and ... for the first time in forever - I didn’t sabotage myself.  I keep looking over my shoulder, but there are no other hangers-on to hijack my new status! I’ll admit, it's a little disorienting, but I think I am finally retired.  But then the thought dawned on me.  Despite all the past demands on my life, I have been lucky enough to reached this point with good health and independence.  And now finally, my time belongs to me - to do what I want.  Some folks never reach this point.While I know life can change in a moment I have taken a precaution to prevent self sabotage  - there is no room in my life for measuring tapes!!  I am hoping that will be enough.  Today I am retired!"},
{"title": "My Winter Puzzle", "date": "Friday, January 21, 2022", "text": "My current puzzle is a Christmas scene.  It is called Christmas Cheer by the Vermont Christmas Company.  I haven’t done enough puzzles to develop a favored company.I didn’t have as much time before Christmas to work on this puzzle as I hoped and here I am after Christmas - actually mid-January - working on a Christmas theme.  I considered stopping the work and putting it away for next year, but knowing me, I might not want to do this same puzzle again.  I love having a dedicated space that I don’tneed to change out for other use.Of course, today a snow storm is predicted and this puzzle is full of snow ... so now it is my Winter Puzzle.  It probably is best I finish it this year and then re-home it.  I seldom re-read books and creating jigsaw puzzles are the same. I seldom repeat a puzzle.  I have glued a number of puzzles together that were of interest to my Grand daughter and she has them hanging in her play room.This puzzle is quite large.  As I typically do, I began with the border pieces.  Then I usually pick items within the puzzle to put together - items that are easy to find in the mix of puzzle pieces - which in the beginning is a lot to paw through. This time I focused on the Christmas trees.  That was a mistake.  Finding the pieces was not hard, but getting them put together was harder than I thought.  I started focusing on the people in the picture.  That went faster. And then the buildings.  And with time, some of the Christmas trees began to take shape.  This last tree is still a struggle.The cost of puzzles climbed during the pandemic, mostly because people were so interested in doing home activities and puzzle companies had trouble keeping up with the demand.   In 2020 when I rediscovered the joy of putting puzzles together I went on a binge of puzzle purchases.  I sort of went puzzle crazy.  Beyond this puzzle I have 24 puzzles waiting for me to assemble.  Some were cheap - a few were expensive.  A few were gifts. Now, that puzzles are widely available again, I realize that I wouldn't spend more than $20 for one.  The time and enjoyment I get from them is well worth the $20 or less spent.  But some puzzles go for upwards of $30 or $40 dollars.  Since I don’t repeat many, that cost would be too pricy for one completion only.  I am a little loathed to buy puzzles second hand.  I would hate to find a piece missing.  But if the picture was compelling enough, I might risk it.I have heard the opinion that doing a jigsaw puzzle is not a productive use of time - especially if it is dismantled after it is completed.  I guess I can understand that opinion on one level, but I also believe that not all activities need to be productive.  Relaxation is also an important state for both mind and body.  The path to relaxation is different for everyone.  Based on recent events - completing jigsaw puzzles is a pretty popular method of relaxation.Do you do jigsaw puzzles?  Do you have a preferred vendor?  What is the range of cost that you find reasonable?  What is your experience with previously owned puzzles?One last picture - update as of Wednesday night!  The trees are finally complete (and they weren’t fun to do) as well as much of the bottom.  Hoping the sky isn’t as hard as it looks.  😀"},
{"title": "I forgot ... this is fun! ", "date": "Tuesday, January 18, 2022", "text": "Ever have a hobby that you set aside ... set aside for years ... and then, because you have a slight injury  and extra time ... you pick it up again on a whim ... and remember just how much FUN it is!!  Forgotten and challenging fun with a few surprises thrown in.That is me and Legos.  Yep!  Legos ... the building blocks of children. But hasn’t been for just children for a long time.  Not by a long shot!  Not by size, or by complexity or by cost!  Especially not by cost - because the kits for adults (those over 16) are quite expensive, and only get more expensive when Lego retires certain kits. More than 5 years ago I built my first pair of buildings.  The Pet Store and a Private Townhouse Residence.This was my first build. And I discovered when I was searching for these pictures in my blog historythat I built them in 2015!  My heavens.  So it has been more like 7 years.  Time has passed so fast.And these were my first surprises.  I was building the basement level of the townhouse and following the directions so very carefully ... I began constructing some of the interior pieces - without knowing what they were.  Imagine my surprise and amusement when I discovered they were a telephone and a toilet!  I was building a TOILET!!  So darn cute.Anyway, now that I have set my knitting needles and crochet hooks aside, I looked for ways to fill that time and not stress out my digits.  Thankfully, over the years since that first build, I have requested a number of lego kits for gifts.  I must have 5 or 6 waiting.  The time to begin building again is PERFECT!The kit I am working on now is The Detective Agency - The Pool Hall - Al’s Barber Shop with another residence squeezed in-between!  This is the picture off the box.For those who aren’t aware of how the construction is approached,  I thought I would share some of my methods.All the pieces come in separate bags like pictured above.  The bags are numbered 1 to 4.  Each number is the sequence they suggest you make the kit in. I made this shot above bigger so you can get the feel and logic of the sorting.  First off, all the bags marked with a #1 have already been constructed into the first floor of the Pool Hall. Front of the pool hall.  If you look through the glass doors you can just see a bit of the pool table.Looking down from the top you can see the ceiling fan I built (put a smile on my facewhen I figured that out) and below that is the pool table.Here is a better shot of the pool table before the walls went up.Now I am preparing to do all the bags marked #2.  Beyond the fact they have gathered all the pieces together that  I need all for the next section in these #2 bags, I can see no logic to the pieces as they are packaged.  All 4 bags are a mix of shapes, sizes and colors.  So I had to come up with my own logic for sorting.I simply sort by color.Lego’s instruction book is also a marvel.  No words.  Just each step pictured, starting with the exact pieces you need next.  You then compare your previous work to the picture in the book and use those pieces you pulled to build your room one baby step at a time.Literally - no words. Really very international.  Legoscan sell their kits all over the world without worryingabout translations.  Genius.When this kit is complete it will be placed beside my first one in a plastic demonstration case to keep the dust off.  I will continue building my little town one set of buildings at a time.One final note.  I have never ever had a piece missing.  How they manage to manufacture and package this as they do would be a very interesting documentary to see.  But in the back of the instruction book is a listing of all the pieces used - with a picture of the piece in the color used and its number.  It shouldn’t be too hard to get a replacement."},
{"title": "Shocking - I am making potholders", "date": "Sunday, January 16, 2022", "text": "You know ... I gave up a few things since the beginning of the New Year.  And when that happened I found time I forgot I had.  So I looked around and realized - hey - you bought this larger than normal pot holder loom last year, and you bought these expensive all wool pot holder loops to make 3 pot holders.  So here is the pictorial story of the hand made pot holders, that finally got made and I am so glad.This loom is larger than the standard pot holder loom.  And I love the size of the pot holders it makes.Here is the first potholder that I made in colors that match my kitchen.Years ago I bought a pot holder loom and wool loops and it made the standard (but small-ish) potholders. Here is the new pot holder made on the bigger loom.  Pretty big difference in size.Another photo shot for size.I show this picture as a lesson!  When I made the first bigger potholder I was sitting on the beach with my sister and cousin.  I wove the potholder and figured I could get it off the loom with just my fingers. After all, that is what I did before.  But on a larger loom, it is way easier to lose control and find a scrambled mess in your hands.  And it was a total mess and I had to take it all apart and start again.  Notice the tool they suggested you use to release the pot holder from the loom.Notice the anchoring loops used to keep the pot holder ON THE LOOM  until you are finished binding off.Notice the written instructions that I finally sat down and read before my second attempt at making a simple pot holder.  After I got over myself, thinking I didn’t need no stupid instructions, (when in reality I did) ... see the 3 potholders I finally made with the very expensive wool loops I purchased when I purchased the larger loom.I have had the supplies to make these pot holders for more than a year.  When I finally quit my board position and took a hiatus from knitting and crocheting to let my thumb heal .... I discovered I had time for other fun activities - and these pot holders were great fun.AND just so you know, wool is an ideal fabric for making potholders.  I have had the smaller wool potholders for years and the heat never makes my hand uncomfortable.  But a bigger size potholder makes better sense so you don’t accidentally touch any hot surfaces directly.Now that these are done, I am once again letting my wondering eye check out what should be next."},
{"title": "Downton Abbey", "date": "Friday, January 14, 2022", "text": "Binge watching long running TV shows or limited streaming series are one of my favorite pastimes in the evening.  I have watch The West Wing, The Walking Dead, Monk, The Witcher, Queen’s Gambit, Outlander, The Wheel of Time, and Glee, just to name a few.  And some of them I have seen more than once.  They are great fun. My current binge series is Downton Abbey.  I saw the first season previously, and maybe parts of the second in the past, but there are a total of 6 seasons and it is highly rated so I started watching it again.  I really enjoy watching shows that are far far outside the scope of my experience, but interesting to watch and sometimes educational of the times depicted.  Downton Abbey fits the bill because it has many season and it is far far far outside my life experience, and some people really did live like that in the early part of the 20th century.  It also gives the flavor of the working man ... how they lived.  It is a time when things seemed to move slower ... not like today when if you blink - you missed it.But I have developed some observations about this series and I thought I’d share them here.Oh.My.Dear.God!  The houses of the aristocracy were enormous ... the extreme.  Of course they had bunches of servants because how else could you live in that much space!  But I had a hard time wrapping my head around the amount of space in the structures. And the amount of stuff you owned.  Just an awesome thought.  The houses are beautiful!!  Not cozy, warm or even comfortable, but just museums to a time in history when architecture was ‘king.’  But imagine trying to heat those buildings!  Impossible I would imagine.And they dress for dinner every single night like they are going to a State dinner. EVERY SINGLE NIGHT!  Their hair is dressed by their attendants every single day.  EVERY SINGLE DAY!  I would go mad with that kind of structure and expectation!Lady Mary drove me insane in the first 2 seasons.  I found myself saying frequently - “you stupid woman”.  Her younger sisters seem to be growing and transitioning into the new world that is heading their way.  Even her father and mother see the changes that are coming and they are evolving in small ways.  As the seasons progress, she finally seems to achieve a kind of maturity.The clothes are to die for.  I totally love the styles, the costumes - just beautiful.The social class structure within the English culture is striking.  Even within the lower working class - there is a ranking.  With all that said, I am really enjoying it - more than I thought I would - even the parts that drive me crazy.  Season 2 includes the end of World War I and the 1918 Flu Pandemic.  I am pretty sure I didn’t see many of the later seasons so it should be really fun and interesting for the next few weeks.Do you binge watch shows on Netflix or Amazon?  What are some of your favorite shows?  I am always looking for a few good title."},
{"title": "The Price for Stupidity!", "date": "Wednesday, January 12, 2022", "text": "New Discovery!! Just like Covid 19 - knitting disorders have ‘variants!' As I was preparing this blog post to be titled Start-itis, one of my blog buddies, Susan, of e-i-e-i-omg! did a post on AAOCKD - ACK for short! 😁 Or for long:Advanced Age Obsessive Compulsive Knitting Disorder(Be sure to follow the link to visit her blog to see what she is up to and how ACK as impacted her.)I looked up Start-itis just to be sure of the definition. The Urban Dictionary defines Start-itis as - repeatedly starting new projects while having multiple uncompleted projects.  ACK is most probably very close ‘cousin” of Start-itis. I am guessing that what separates the 2 conditions are the words “advanced age” and “knitting” -  both, by the way, are true for me.  While Start-itis can afflict anyone, at any age, and any activities, ACK seems exclusively directed at us folks of a “certain age!\"In my experience, start-itis is the strong desire to have the completed item - and there are so many many wonderful completed items to be desired in knitting and crochet - that you can’t help but want to start them all. I haven’t experienced much start-itis in my knitting life. It always seemed counter productive to have many projects started and then starting another new one - it was like creating multiple distractions to stand in the way of getting any one thing finished.  And when I discover a long ago abandoned unfinished project, I always felt sad for the yarn and the time lost.  My interest in the project and even the yarn itself waned and I ripped out the work - and sometimes even discarded the yarn.But since January 1st - a fierce case of start-itis or maybe ACK has gripped me.  And it is not project driven - it is yarn driven!  I have a strong desire to actually cast on many of the beautiful - and expensive - yarns I have accumulated over the years.  God knows, I don’t need another scarf or shawl or sweater - I can’t wear all that I have now.  But I want to work with those beautiful yarns and see how they look in a fabric as opposed to sitting idle, wrapped in a ball or skein, for ages and ages.... BUT... and it is a very big BUT ... after having casted on a number of new projects - 4 by my count, right after finishing a very large crochet blanket in record time ... I am now paying the cost for all that stupidity!  Here is a pictorial view of the problem ...Normal right thumb.Not normal left thumb.The Fix #1The “not normal” picture was taken after I spent some time stretching that thumb into a straight position this morning - which it couldn’t hold without help from my right hand - but at least was improved from what I saw when I got up!! Yikes. (And yes, I did knit last night for about 4 hours, ... BECAUSE I thought the problem was due to crocheting, and I was knitting!  Apparently I was wrong.) Bummer.When I saw how sad my left thumb was this morning, I went out to Google Doctor to self diagnosis myself (no lectures, please, since I had no intention of going to my doctor now and bringing a ‘hitchhiker virus' home to cause other problems, thank you Covid 19. 😷)  Turns out my symptoms match exactly Trigger Thumb caused by over use - it even listed crafts as a culprit! Crap!  The price I pay for stupidity! So Fix #1 is no knitting or crocheting for awhile, the use of a thumb brace, and anti-inflammatories - like Advil! While I was getting Fix #1 implemented my brain was thinking ... What will I do with my time!!!  Well being a hobby hoarder collector, gratefully I have options.Fix #2 PUZZLESI have about 20 puzzles waiting to be completed.  Since I anticipate this knitting and crochet abstinence will be for weeks - maybe a few months - I set up a puzzle station on a desk - moving the table top computerthat my husband can no longer use - to the side.  It is a great set up because Ican work on the puzzle in short bursts - out of the way of my husband.I got this puzzle for Christmas.  A Girl and Her Dragon.And this one too.  The Curse of Blackwood Hall.Fix #3 - WEAVINGMy looms have been idle for some time. And I have lost interest in most rigid heddlelooms - in fact I am trying to sell my 24# rigid heddle loom with stand now. But I have 2 smaller rigid heddles, several continuous weave pin looms, and 2 tapestry looms - all of whichI am still interested in using - especially now when knitting and crochet is off the table. Right about now I should have a cousin who is probably jumping up and down with joy.She has been trying to get me back to weaving for some time.Fix #4  Legos I have about 6 Expert Level Lego buildings that I have put on the back burner for years.  Itis hard to explain why that is the case.  I LOVE building lego structures.  I startedone of my kits last night and marveled at whyI hadn’t been doing this all along.This set matches another set I have already created.And just this Christmas I got the Lego Tree house!!I can’t wait to start that.Fix # 5  Audio BooksAdd to that a rather large library of audio books I need to catch up on while I make an effort to increase my daily step counts.And no pictures for Fix #6, but a to-do list calls to me as well - items that have been bumped and bumped and bumped, again and again, when the siren’s call of knitting begs me to sit and just knit.  Stuff like cleaning out the pantry so I don’t buy stuff I already have while discarding stuff I brought with me from the townhouse 5 1/2 years ago (that just may be out of date - ha!, or I won’t eat because it is just too unhealthy,) and sorting out some more craft items I want to donate so that I can focus on the items I really want to do when my thumb returns to normal.  And there is always the mundane stuff like the laundry this is waiting for me right now as I finish this post - and if I don’t get to it by the morning, I’ll be wearing the dirty stuff again.  Ugh!No - I have plenty to keep me busy.  But despite all my good intentions and all my appropriate Fixes ... I still feel sad about setting aside all my wonderful yarn.But no matter ... I am left handed and this is my left thumb and ... have you tried to do anything recently without using your thumbs?  Let me assure you - it is damn hard!! And if I want this left thumb back without pain and with some strength ... I need to let it heal and hope it is not a permanent feature.  The consequences of my stupidity shouldn’t be a life long sentence.  *sigh*"},

A world fix is almost impossible achieve.  There are so many in the world who would gladly step up and get the shot if it was available to them.  If you really think on it - we can’t even feed all the people that are on this planet - provide adequate housing, clean water, clean air, education.  Will we ever get a Covid vaccine in all those arms?  Highly unlikely.  So Covid 19 and its family of off-shoots will be with us forever.  When I hear people saying we need to “whip this virus in 2022, I just want to laugh.Just like the flu, I can choose to lower my chances of getting seriously ill or maybe dying from that little bug, but can we get everyone to take the flu shot?  Nope!  Covid will be the same, I fear.But I came upon this one perspective on Facebook.  It really hit home for me.  I just want to share.I'm fully vaccinated and boostered. No, I don't know \"what's in it\".  Neither this vaccine or the ones I had as a child. Nor do I know what's in the 11 secret herbs and spices at KFC.I also don't know exactly what's in Ibuprofen or Paracetamol-- they just cure my headaches & my pains.  I don't know what's in tattoo ink, botox and fillers, or every ingredient in my soap, shampoo or deodorants. I don’t know the long term effect of mobile phone use, or whether or not that restaurant I just ate at REALLY used clean foods and washed their hands.There's a lot of things I don't know.I do know one thing: life is short, very short. I personally still want to do things. I want to travel and hug people without fear, and find a little feeling of life \"before”.Throughout my life I've been vaccinated against many diseases. Measles, mumps, rubella, polio, chickenpox, hepatitis, pneumonia, influenza, rotavirus, tetanus, pertussis. My parents (and I) trusted the science, and never had to suffer through or transmit any of those said diseases.I'm vaccinated. Not to please the government. Not to make other people do it. But I don't want to:* die from Covid-19* lie in ICU with a pipe down my throat * not be able to hug my loved ones * have to test routinely* live my life in fearCan't say it any clearer."},
{"title": "The With Love, Granny Blanket", "date": "Friday, January 7, 2022", "text": "To circle back around on a project I started on November 13, 2021 - here is the finished With Love, Granny Blanket.  I finished it on December 25 and I gave it to Esk on December 26.I shortened the border from the original pattern.  It was supposed to be 8 rows around - resulting in a rather wide but beautiful border. I did only 3 rows.  There were a few reasons why I stopped early.  As I was completing the body of this blanket I realized it had considerable weight. Such a wide border would only add to that weight. The other reason was that the blanket was already quite large.  It didn’t need to be bigger. It was intended for a child’s junior bed and it was large enough to accomplish that.When I finished the blanket I discovered that it was not entirely square.  I was so careful in counting my stitches with every single row.  I suspect the fact it was crocheted from corner to corner rather than side to side, may have played into this result.I did do a wet block (without pins or wires) - something that acrylic doesn’t usually need, and it did help but did not totally correct the problem.When folding it - it is easy to see that the corners don’t meet.  But I love this blanket and it is going to a 3 year old - who won’t even notice such things.  I totally expect to find it on the floor in her bedroom at some point - so it is intended to be used and enjoyed without limits - so it fills that expectation entirely.I may make this pattern again - or one similar.  It was fast and satisfying to do.  But if I do make it again it will be made top to bottom or side to side - but not corner to corner."},

{"title": "The Wave of Resignations and One of My Own", "date": "Monday, January 3, 2022", "text": "If you watch or listen to the news you can’t miss the stories about the current trend ...                    The Great Way of Resignations in 2021.Apparently one of the impacts of this extended pandemic is that people have reassessed their current jobs and have started resigning in rather large numbers.  When I first heard about this I wondered how true this report was.  But over time I have read and heard enough about this wave of resignations to determine this is a real thing.  It is sort of like folks have had enough time on their hands (cooped up in their isolation) to stop, think and exam exactly how they are spending their life hours and decided changes must be made.  In a few years it will be fascinating to read the sociology study of exactly what happened during this time in the group mentality.Since I am retired I figured it didn’t really impact me.  After all, I don’t have a paying job.  No boss to please.  Even though I thought I understood what was going on, I didn’t fit into that great wave of resignations.  Apparently I was wrong.Starting in the fall of last year, I was very restless and unhappy.  I was in a 2nd year of a 3 year commitment as a board member to my Condo Association - and, as Secretary, I had periods where I spent at least 30 hours a week focused on board activities.  If the position was just setting agendas and taking minutes, it would be ok.  It was far more, and I was fatigued by what it demanded. And as anyone knows who has held a position on a homeowners board, it is also a thankless position.   I was so busy and stressed by this ‘volunteer’ job, that I found myself feeling a certain level of resentment when my husband (who is blind and really does need help at times) asked for assistance.  (Red flag, folks)  I would immediately feel shame at my silent reaction.So on December 3rd I resigned - giving 30 days notice.I immediately felt bad about my resignation because the Treasurer followed me in resigning as well as the Member-at-large board memberl.  All for similar reasons - the work load was too much and the resident support was too little.  The Treasurer gave 60 days notice and the Member-at-Large gave 3 months notice so it wasn’t like we all walked out the door together ... but it was still a big impact on a community of 106 owners. At the same time, I felt great relief and knew this was the right decision for me.  It was time for someone else to step up and take a turn.  I knew I had to put my blinders on and not be influenced by my emotions or the reactions of others.  I think before the pandemic, I might have held on longer and made myself stick with a commitment I made.  I would self-talk myself into staying by saying things like - there is always tomorrow for the other things you want to do and you are keeping your older brain active in this position.  On the other hand some of my friends are showing signs of mental and physical decline due to age.  And who knows - they might be finding the same in me.  And news reports are filled with so much suffering and death from a tiny and very adaptive virus I cannot see.  Many people planned on a tomorrow and there wasn’t one.  I am 75 in April of 2022.  Exactly how many of my own “tomorrows\" should I be devoting to this board position.  The decision came back pretty quick.  It was 0!I just couldn’t walk away without giving the next volunteer the tools needed to be successful.  So I saved my electronic files to a thumb drive and cleaned up my paper files for the hand off.   When I stepped into this role, I got one file with about 10 pages from the previous board member.  Not much to build on.  But I am done now and I have no regrets.Of course, in anticipation of reclaiming personal time, my nature is to start a to-do list of activities that I have ignored or tabled out of lack of time.  I am a list maker after all.  It is, however, my list to do or to ignore.  I feel so much better having control of my tomorrows ... however many more there are.So ... to all those people out there in that huge wave of resignations ... I get it! And this is the first of my “doesn’t matter” items ...dropped from all my tomorrows."},

I made it to January 1, 2022.Welcome 2022!  Anyone who has read my blog posts knows that historically I have a difficult relationship with the month of December.  Sadly, December 2021 was no different.  There was another probable loss, except not a death this time.  While not entirely sure, it feels like a long time friendship may have just ended.  I surely hope I am wrong, but at present, it feels like an end.   I blame Covid-19 for this loss because the parting of ways might never have happened without it.  Family needs, however, are always a higher priority than those of friendships - at least in our family.  Sorry to be so cryptic, but I just want to say it wasn’t the best of Decembers.  Not the worst but not uneventful either.  I wonder how many other relationships have been changed or lost (directly or indirectly) by this stupid virus (a virus that isn't so stupid if it can upset the whole world the way it has.).  I wish the best for these friends as we go our separate ways in 2022.Enough on that topic!December 2021 is gone.  January!  Wonderful January.  The beginning of a new year, a clean slate, a perfect time to change direction, and the ideal time to narrow focus.I did look back to January 2021 to see if I made any promises or (God forbid) resolutions.  I had not! I gave up New Year Resolutions a long time ago.  And I won’t make any this year either. But 2021, with its continued pandemic, did teach me a few things.If I have learned anything from this year it is to narrow my focus and shed the distractions that just don’t matter.  And it has been an interesting exercise to determine exactly what my personal “don’t matter” items are.Going forward in January (did I say already that I LOVE January?) I plan to bring my “don’t matter” items to the forefront in a few posts. Sort of like the reverse of a Resolution where you add steps or practices to you life to make things better.  I like to think getting rid of “don’t matter” items can have the same impact.Welcome 2022!"},

{"title": "The Quilt and the Blanket", "date": "Wednesday, December 15, 2021", "text": "I dedicated this past weekend to wrapping Christmas gifts.  It always takes considerable time.  Because I am working slower now-a-days - this task which used to fill a full 10 hour day, now fills parts of 3 days.  I just don’t have the energy or desire to push through and complete the wrapping in one day like I used to.  But I enjoy the process - and this year, at least, I will get a chance to see my family open these gifts in person.  Last year Zoom was my only option and it was better than not seeing them at all.  Man, that was a bummer.One of my gifts for Esk is a matching quilt and sheet set for a junior size bed in the Frozen theme.  For those who don’t know what Frozen is - it is a Disney cartoon story about two princesses, Anna and Elsa,  their kingdom and their adventure.  If you want to know more - ask any kid who crosses your path.  Any kid and most adults.  Yes, it is that big!Anyway, before I wrapped the quilt set, I had this notion that I would I open up the quilt and place the blanket and quilt together.  I did this previously as I picked the colors for the blanket specifically using the Frozen color scheme.  Now with just over half of the blanket completed this might be the last time I could catch a picture of the 2 items together. So I opened completely both window shades in the guest room and turned on all the lights - hoping to improve my success as capturing the colors of the quilt and the crochet blanket correctly.And I think I did it.  The colors shown as almost perfect.  Finally!!In opening up the quilt I realized the quilt is also quite large, so now I am very glad that I am making the blanket as big as it is.  I was a bit concerned that the blanket would swamp the quilt. Glad to find out that it won’t.And as I snapped a few shots I made another executive decision.I am not going to wait until her February birthday to give her the blanket.  I will give it to her as soon as it is finished.  They are too cute together. Note:   If you look at the first picture that showed the quilt and the blanket together - in the lower left hand corner the color of the bedspread can be seen. In every previous picture I took and posted, that bedspread looks a dark beige!  It is not - it is green!  It is amazing how much better natural light is in photography."},

God knows what she was thinking when she read my message. Nope!  She has her pizza cutter. Nuts! I circled back into my brain for another reason.  No one visited with a pizza cutter ... I don’t think.  No one of my social circle carries a pizza cutter in their purse or in their back pocket and besides - would you admit something like that?  I wonder if pizza cutters are on the “no fly list” for airports!  🤣 I am going to bet they have seen everything.  But visiting my condo with one.  Not likely.   Could the former owner of the condo accidentally left this pizza cutter behind and I am just finding it now - 5 years later?  Ha!  Only a desperate brain would accept that as a possibility.It is possible, I suppose, that I misplaced pizza cutter #1 and then went out and bought pizza cutter #2 and just today #1 pops up ...  Nope!   I have no memory of doing such thing and to consider the possibility that I may have completely blacked out on a trip to the store to buy pizza cutter #2 ... well I am not ready to go with that yet.Is someone gas lighting me? I sure hope so!   So I am going with that - no matter how paranoid it sounds because all other options have ramifications I am not prepared to accept. The opposite problem and I are 'good friends.'   Items ‘hiding’ in plain sight ...  sometimes on the bridge of my nose, on top of my head or right in my hand or right where they should be and I look right past them.  Yes, I know that problem well! But I don’t have room in my life for another “good friend” unless that good friend is causing extra $100 to show up in my hand that I didn’t know I had.  But an extra pizza cutter ... !!"},

{"title": "The Last Minute Granddaughter Blanket", "date": "Tuesday, December 7, 2021", "text": "Here is my first update on a blanket I decided to start on November 13 (November of this year - not last year) as a gift for my grand daughter. The first pictures are November pictures.The following pictures are from 2 days ago - early December.  It is a pattern that has grown on me the longer I work on it.  The lacy hearts are subtle - not easily seen up close while working on it.Even when I spread out one heart on my lap, like in this blue stripe, I think - I can’t really see the full structure of one lace heart.In almost every close up view of my work - as I crochet - the pattern seems lost.But stretched out like so below, it is easy to see how cute it is.  And the more I do on this pattern,the more I think about doing a second blanket as some point - maybe one for me.In the picture below the blanket is extended it full length on a queen size bed.  It will be larger than I thought using the colors I wanted and the size of the stripes.  The pink stripe is the center of the blanket and at present is about double the width seen in this picture. Pink will be the widest stripe.  As of today, I am about 3 rows into the decreases - meaning I am working on the second half of this blanket now.  And with each row the rows get shorter now.  I am so glad I decided to crochet this blanket instead of knitting it.  If I was to have any chance of finishing this blanket for Christmas I needed to crochet instead of knit since knitting is so much slower.  And I have really enjoyed making this blanket - the change of the colors, the completion of each row of hearts, the growth in size - all added to the enjoyment.The real question is will this blanket be done by December 24?  Unlikely.  Once the blanket is complete, I still have a border that is about 2-3 inches wide to complete.  But it should be done by the New Year for sure."},
{"title": "Please, make it January.", "date": "Monday, November 29, 2021", "text": "(This is not one of my happy posts.  You can skip it if you need too. I won’t mind. Just giving a voice to feelings that I carry with me around this time of year - in hopes that putting fingers to keyboard I can shed some baggage that follows me during December.)In the next few days it will be December 1.  Again! December!  My least favorite month of the year.  I can already feel the holiday pressure of getting things done crowding me.  How I wish that was my only problem. The real issue is more complicated. I feel concern creeping up on me that the month passes without any bad stuff like illnesses or worse. I know that sounds a little bit paranoid - but December and I have a history together and it isn’t positive.   How did December get such a bad wrap?   Truthfully, I didn’t always hate December and the number of happy December holidays far outweighs the sad ones ... so why can’t I just throw off the bad ones and enjoy the season? Being a generally happy positive person the other 11 months of the year, I gave this question a lot of thought and discovered only one answer for me: the intensity of events and life changing nature of some of my Decembers sit in stark contrast to the “let us all be happy” message of December.  The first dent in my relationship with December happened in 1970 with the death of my dad right before Christmas. It was a sudden event - a fall down a flight of stairs that was not discovered promptly and after a few days in ICU he died - several days before Christmas.  His passing was a combination of sorrow and some relief.  He was an alcoholic and he made family life hard.  But I loved him in spite of all the pain he caused.  That Christmas without him was my first experience of sadness while all the world seemed joyful.   Even in the funeral home where our family gathered to say goodbye reminders of the season were everywhere ... tastefully done, of course, but there all the same.  Ironically, like bookends - the death of my mother came just after Christmas in 2014.  These events were 44 years apart - certainly healing should have happened in that time.  And it did. Each Christmas after his death I remembered him with forgiveness and love. That yearly remembrance felt like a healthy and realistic admission that sad things can happen at Christmas time, and you can move on and to be grateful for the happy events - recognizing that Christmas happiness is not ‘promised'.  But my mom's death was preceded by many hard December experiences - each one more difficult than the last until I couldn’t stand the month at all.  The first event happened about a year after mom moved in with me in 2007.  A vicious GI bug spread through our family the day after Thanksgiving.  It was the worst GI virus I have ever had.  While normal healthy individuals could survive that, my mom was in her 80s.  It devastated and hospitalized her - not once but twice in quick succession.  The second hospitalization landed her in ICU because she was septic. As with all her hospitalizations, I was with her 24/7.  Rehab followed and I followed her there as well.  Getting her well consumed me.  I approached her recovery as a battle to be won.  I pushed medical staff to get her home before Christmas.  She rallied quickly.  When she came home it was December 22 - little to no holiday prep had been done for my own family’s Christmas.  Some gifts were purchased but no wrapping, no Christmas tree, and no meal preparation.  But no matter, my mom was home.   The tree got put up on December 23rd, and the gifts that weren’t purchased by then where replaced with checks. I purchased a fully cooked Christmas Day meal from a local grocery store - and we called it good!  The real celebration was ... Mom was home and doing well.  I won that battle.I won the battle over several other hospitalizations and rehabilitations over the course of a few years getting her back home, but  each left her weaker than before. At age 85 a hospitalization and a very long rehab experience ended with her being placed in Assisted Living.  And, of course, that happened in the month of December.  The community I picked was top notch, very homey with great staff, and beautifully decorated for the holiday, but I knew mom didn’t want any this.  She wanted to go home.  The final determining factor were the 20 steps up from the parking lot to my townhome - steps she could not climb any more.  I remember riding home that first night she spent in Assisted Living.  The December lights on houses I passed were twinkling brilliantly, the Christmas music was playing on the radio, and I was in tears the entire way home at this permanent change in all our lives.  That night I started to intentionally ignore December ‘cheer’ that tried to invite me at every turn to be happy .The last 3 years of her life she lived away from home - 2 years in Assisted Living and 1 year in Nursing.  As always, the staff made the holidays as grand as they could.  But it was hard to ignore that fact that about half the residents were mobile enough to visit a family member’s home for the holiday. We couldn’t do that for mom.  I hated those last 3 Christmases more than you could imagine.  As December approached I felt disappointment and sadness begin to grow in me.  To compensate I spent as much time as I could during those holidays with her, and extended family came for visits as well.  We even arranged a separate Holiday family meal with her on site, but the one thing she always wanted was to go home,  and I couldn’t make that happen. Those 3 Christmases cemented my distaste for December and it was when I learned to yearn for January.Starting in early 2014 at 88 years old she had a number of serious health issues that could not get resolved. Her dementia had pretty much consumed her with only short glimpses of who she had been as my mom.  In mid-December of that year her chronic problems were growing in intensity.  Her eating had dropped off and she had no interest in her surroundings. I was losing this final battle and it seemed like nothing could halt her decline.  When medical staff finally informed me that she was actively failing, I had already known in my heart she could not be pulled back.  The message - your mother is dying - I got on December 22.  They estimated she would make it to Christmas but not much past that.  Needless to say, there was no holiday spirit left to crush in me.  By this time Christmas Day was just another date on a calendar.  My only comfort in those last days and hours were that the dementia I fought so hard against, was finally her ‘friend’ ... shielding her awareness of another passing Christmas away from home. Mom and I lost this last battle together, but at least I was the only one grieving. She died on December 28th.  I was numb driving home that evening.  I don’t remember the trip at all - but I am sure without a doubt - those Christmas images I learned to ignore - were everywhere.This year will be the 7th year anniversary since her passing.  Unfortunately traditional Christmas sounds and sights still remind me of our years of struggle.   I still yearn for January.  But now at 74, I accept that this will not change.  You can’t ‘un-ring a bell' - the memories cannot be wiped from the mind as if they never happened.   I accept them now, however, with more grace.  A grand daughter has helped me to find some peace in these celebrations, but I still feel it is a lot for those tiny little shoulders to bear, so I don’t rest entirely on her existence as my way out of holiday gloom.  After 7 years I am better at hiding that sad part of me by putting a smile on my face during December - especially with family.  But when I am alone with only my thoughts during this month, the memories of holidays mom and I shared appear like a flash flood - sudden and sweeping away everything else.   Please, make it January.  (Has the sharing of this helped me shed some of my ‘baggage?’  Maybe a make-up case worth.  Has it increased just one person’s understanding that others struggle mightily during the holidays?  I hope so.)During happier times when she would sit on my front step and just enjoy the feelingof being outside.Mom and I in 2011Taken at the rehab facility she eventually would call “home.”  Mom, my sister and I in 2012Taken 2 months after she moved into Assisted Living. Is it January yet?"},
{"title": "Progress Report: Frozen Colors Afghan", "date": "Wednesday, November 24, 2021", "text": "I made a bit of progress on the crochet afghan I am stitching for my granddaughter for Christmas, so it seemed like the time for a picture update. First picture - taken within about 48 hours of starting on November 13.The pattern is called “With Love, Granny” Afghan Pattern designed by Crystal White-VanCleemput, of JolieKnotsCrochet.  The word ‘Granny' is a reference to the Granny Crochet stitch that makes up the heart patterns in the blanket.  The ‘With Love' reference is a nod to all the hearts in the pattern. But I love how when you put all the words together in the title it can be understood as a gift from a loving grandmother - which my afghan actually is.Several days later.I am glad I decided to crochet this instead of knit it.  There is no knit stitch that covers this much ground this fast based on the speed at which I knit and crochet (which isn’t fast.)I am pretty happy with the faint suggestion of the heart pattern in this design.  Checking Ravelry, one crocheter called it “Watermark.”  And that is exactly the impression the hearts give - like a watermark on paper. You know it is there but it doesn’t demand the viewer’s attention on the simple background of double crochets.A few close ups of the design.Based on how much yarn has been sucked up by this project so far, I had to once again purchase additional skeins of yarn to complete the afghan based on the order I am using them.  Since it is a corner to corner design, the light blue and white are falling into the part of the pattern that is the widest and based on my planned use of the design - there will be more rows of the colors in the wider center ... and therefore needs more yarn.  Thankfully I could get extra skeins and colors I needed at Joann Fabric’s shop near me.After the light blue is completed, I have a pink that will fall into the center of the afghan.  It will have more rows than any previous color.  Then I will begin to decrease, going back to the light blue, and then the white and then the lavender, etc. etc. etc.  So based on those plans I think I am about 1/3 of the way through this pattern - only 1/3 because the closer I get to the center the wider the stripes are.And I gave some thought to the border. Designer’s picture from the pattern.I don’t care for the open lacy border of this pattern.I don’t care for the border that came with this pattern, and I planned to do something that had a picot edge.  And then I stumbled upon a border called Whipsiderry Border designed by Dedri from her blog called  Look At What I Made.  Although I am always going to be primarily a knitter, Dedri manages to drag me into crochet time and time again with her beautiful designs.  She does the most stunning crochet, and her website is full of her free designs, beautiful pictures, exceeding detailed written and pictorial instructions and links to her YouTube step-by-step video instructions (a must for me with crochet.)  The Whipsiderry Border I plan to use.I love the solid look of this crochet border. It is wider than most with a solid foundation of double crochets that match the double crochet background of the hearts afghan I am working on ... and then is topped off with an appealing crochet lace pattern.This border will add considerable extra work to the afghan once I complete the body (ha!  Just what I need with a tight deadline. Not!)  Other possible designs would have made for a quicker border, but now my mind is settled on this design so it is what I will use - and if it isn’t quite done for Christmas, I will just give it to her after Christmas. (See?  I can be flexible.)"},

{"title": "Playing “Chicken” With Christmas - Again!", "date": "Wednesday, November 17, 2021", "text": "About 15 years ago I played ‘chicken' with Christmas. It wasn’t pretty.  I vowed to never do it again!How does one play ‘chicken’ with Christmas?  Well, for me it involves setting unrealistic deadlines for getting things done before the hard deadline of Christmas Day!  During my last “chicken” event Christmas 15+ years ago, I decided in October to knit 8 projects as gifts. Yes, you read that right.  October and 8 projects, entirely crazy.  The projects were smaller but still, 85 days divided by 8 projects equals approximately 10 days per project from start to finish.  Calculate in time for other activities like eating, sleeping, household tasks, typical Christmas craziness, and a full time job (yes, I was working) and you get way less than 10 days per project. The experience was intense (actually ridiculous!)  So ridiculous, that if I hadn’t had a gallbladder surgery on December 5 of that year (followed by a period of short term disability from my job to heal - 'knitting time' by any other description)  I would never have reached my goal of eight finished Christmas gifts by December 25th.  Since I have limitations on just how many bodily organs I can offer up to the knitting gods for a Christmas deadline, I vowed never to knit for Christmas again. Although it looks like I am breaking that vow this year, I am not. I am crocheting. Ha! (this little loop hole will probably bite me in my butt at some point.)So, with a flush of enthusiasm, on November 13, ( 42 days prior to the deadline) I started a sizable Christmas project - a kid’s blanket!  Another blanket! (I should be committed!)  I have 2 others still 'on the hook' and somehow I talked myself into another one - with a deadline, no less. But I have important reasons why I am doing this project  ...#1 - It is for my granddaughter (No other reasons “need apply,” but I will add them anyway.)#2 - It is crochet and it goes faster than knitting many times over. (True)#3 - It is a simple pattern. (Also true)#4 - It is a stash buster project (normally, yes, except for the 8 additional skeins I purchased to use up the 5 others I had - I think that is a gain of 3! ). Math was not a strong subject for me in school. The colors are all wrong.  Left to right: true purple, light purple and lavender.  Light blue, pink and white come later.A finished project of someone on Ravelry.The pattern is called With Love, Granny Afghan Pattern by Crystal White-VanCleemput of JolieKnots.com.  It uses the granny stitch to make the hearts. My colors match the colors in Frozen - the Disney cartoon that is so popular with children now.  It is a corner to corner pattern - so at this point I am increasing and each row takes longer to complete.Even under an Ott light, the colors are off.I’ll post a few progress pictures between now and December 25th - just to help keep me honest and focused on getting this done.   And just to make things really interesting, I added another Christmas deadline project.  This puzzle which I am working to complete, glue together and frame.  This Disney mermaid is called Ariel and Eskarina dressed up as Ariel for Halloween. She really loved that long red hair.Must stop now - I have deadlines to meet!!"},
{"title": "A Sunrise Reserved For One ", "date": "Monday, November 15, 2021", "text": "I know that no one “owns” the sunrise, but there should be some rules or a reservation system or  something for viewing.Let me back track.My last morning at the ocean I was the first one up (thank you legs!).  I walked out to the balcony and looked behind me.  Still dark.  Roads were quiet!  No one was about. Perfect.  Looking east I could see the start of a beautiful morning with just me and the ocean and the sun. I settled in with my camera phone and my coffee to enjoy the beauty of nature on this last day of my trip to the ocean.I had just these few last hours of my long weekend away from home.  I wanted to make the best of them.And from the looks of the horizon I didn’t have long to wait.  There she was, the sun peeking just above the horizon.And the ocean giving me a gentle wave - to tell me the best was yet to come.  I was ready!And then I heard it!!   Running feet from behind me.   This lady was running down the street with her camera held up high in the air in front of her trying to catch the sunrise.  Seriously ... running with a camera held in front of her!!  As she passed me her feet were loudly slapping the pavement and she was totally unaware I was watching her - because her eyes were not focused on her surroundings but focused entirely on her camera!!!  You can even see the brightness of the sun reflected through her lens.  AND standing between me and the ocean and the sunrise, no less! This was just like butting in line!  How rude. It shouldn’t be allowed!!And then I immediately chastised myself for my unkind selfish thoughts.    So I re-adjusted my camera so thatit seemed as if I was the only one capturing the moment.  Just me, the ocean and my camera!Out of nowhere, the woman and her dog casually wandered into my picture frame.  On “little cat feet” she was (except she had a dog)!  Dang!!  Dang!! Dang!! (Deep breath ... be calm.) Ok, she has a dog. And at least she was quiet - not pounding her feet down the street.   Be kind.  Pet people are good people.Just get over yourself, I kept saying.I readjusted my camera again!  *sigh* And again, just me and the ocean and the sunrise (and these “almost late-to-the-party” folks.)   Just look at that sunrise and the beauty of the colors reflected on the waters. Like a beautiful painting.  You have GOT to be kidding me!! I looked to my left and I saw MORE PEOPLE!!  Hey, guys, this has happened every single morning since the beginning of time!!!!!Go home, please.  Back through my lens again - things were not getting better! No beach space without people.CARS!! They were now pulling up in cars! I checked the street behind this guy to see if buses were lining up!!!!!More new folks. And you will notice, now I am taking pictures of THEM and not the sunrise!!!Focus, focus!My last picture, with the sun light pouring down between the cloudsand the ocean taking a bow with the lovely splash of a wave.AND NO PEOPLE.Ok, this is my last picture! The rays of sun, just needed to take this last picture.  I knew it was mean of me not to want to share this beautiful event that happens every single morning since the beginning of recorded time (and before.) But, seriously, next time I am going to put up a sign at the end of the entrance to 94th Street - stopPrivate Showing!Only One Reservation AcceptedThis sunrise is booked!Try again tomorrow.SignedThe Atlantic Ocean!"},
{"title": "The Phone Call ...", "date": "Thursday, November 11, 2021", "text": "I live by the old adage “No news is good news.” Leaving a handicapped husband behind results in spending as much time preparing him for my absence as I do packing for myself. But I have done these short trips with no problems.  Except I guess my mind is always “on the ready” to respond, to anticipate, to assume the worst while I am gone ‘cause that is what my mind did on this occasion!Important to the following story is this face. Remember this face! My cousin and I were on a short shopping trip to purchase some seafood just outside of town. As we traveled down Ocean Highway, I enjoyed the opportunity to see older housing structures from Ocean City’s early years. The original buildings of the 30s, 40s and 50s located near the original point of the town were more “old-time beachy,” painted in typical light colors, older, only one for two stories high, more weathered from years of use and storms.  I pondered about the history those old buildings could tell! In my youth during the 60s, Ocean City was just a summer beach town and a destination for students Spring Break adventures and family summer trips.  Why I remember a time ....And then my cell phone rang dragging me out of my head and into the present!I glanced at the screen and was surprised to see my downstairs neighbor’s name.  In lightening speed the scenery was forgotten and my mind went to all the reasons (bad ones) that she could be calling me while I was out of town!  Topping the list of reasons was my husband and that something had happened to him. I could feel my heart rate start to climb. I answered!She said hi - just like that. “Hi!” ... like there was no emergency, just a friendly neighborly call.  Confusion peppered my brain.  I was thinking ...  Seriously?  I am out of town, and you are calling to say “hi?\"   It was like she was speaking in Greek and I was listening in Spanish!  All that in one little word ... “hi.” And then she said ... “I think I have one of your window screens. Found it on the sidewalk.”While I did my best to put “window screen” and “husband” in the same sentence meaningfully, she went on. “Yes, I am outside now looking up, and I can see it is missing from your  window.  Should I bring it up to you?”Ahhhh ... ok, window screens ... my heart rate began to slow.    #1 She did not know I was out of town.    #2 She isn’t calling about my husband.    #3 How the heck did my window screen spontaneously fall from my window?  Although my mouth was still bone dry at this point, my tongue was working again.  After letting her know I was out of town, she agreed to keep the screen at her condo till I returned.  I think I managed to end that call without letting on how fracture my brain-tongue connection was.I hung up and immediately called my husband.  He picked up - sounding like everything was fine too!  Of course, he had no idea a screen was missing, so he really was fine!  We spent the next 15 minutes ... him opening and closing windows, and checking for the screens - and once he identified the one that was missing, he shut that window so the bugs wouldn’t come in and Aja wouldn’t fall out! And Aja.  My mind had already jumped to the cause and the culprit! The story behind the story!A few months ago, I discovered what I thought was a defect in a new window screen.  The screen company replaced it - because it wasn’t even one year old.  That screen had a slit near the bottom edge of the frame.  No biggie.  It was apparent to me that the slit was a manufacturing defect.  The screen company honored their guarantee.  All was good.  But with this second episode - the “screen-jumping” episode,  I began to put 2 and 2 together.  One damaged screen, one screen leaping off the second floor spontaneously ... and birds ... lots and lots of neighborhood birds, and some who like to play chicken with my cat - birds with an obvious death wish!  It is cool-ish outside now.  Our windows are mostly closed.  Yes, that is a mini-screen in front of the window screen - clamped in placeby the window above.The windows that are open, now have a protective window screen shield. No other window screens have been forced into taking that leap to the ground since the use of these mini-screens.  So what do you think?  Not naming any names, of course, and I have witnessed nothing. But the evidence is piling up. Do you think this charming little face - is hiding “killer intent” that no thin screen material will keep her from achieving her goal? DEATH TO ALL BIRDS!! 😍Well, she is a cat, after all, and cats are only partly domesticated.  And she is female which is the “business end” of her species and designed for hunting down prey to feed kittens.   And finally, she is a hunter as evidenced by her stalking of flying insects who might have accidentally stumbled into HER condo (through an open screen I might add) and sadly became an amusement as well as an appetizer for her.  Those birds were just too much for her!  Thank God she didn’t fall from the open window.Now in addition to my own prep for travel and my husband’s needs, I have added Aja to my travel check list! Assess cat related hazards.   (check ☑️ ) 🐈Next up: A Sunrise Reserved for One"},

{"title": "Part 1: Art Show at the Beach!", "date": "Saturday, November 6, 2021", "text": "Over its history Ocean City has matured from a lazy beach focused vacation spot to a year round destination for visitors. The large and hard-to-miss Convention Center always has something scheduled but tucked away in a bayside neighborhood close enough for us to walk to is this Arts Center!  I've passed this building on past previous walks never guessing what wonderful things it contained.  The rest of this post will be told with pictures.In the main hall was this dress made entirely of chain links. View from the back.A side view.  Zipper!A matching hat - as if the weight of the dress alone wasn’t enough.Beautiful stone work on the chest!Beautiful bead work dangling from the hem.Picture proof, the dress can be worn. (haha) if you look carefully you can see my hand and phone taking reflected in the glass.  Missed that!This was the first and most impressive display of the art for me. Unusual materials, flattering dress design, interesting small details.  My son, who is into gaming, had made a simple chain link shirt for himself.  I forwarded THESE pictures to his wife - “This is what he should make for you.”  One final picture of the braided chains that ran down each side.  I just couldn’t get enough of this dress. Setting aside the fact it was all metal, the design features on the dress are so flattering to the female form.Onward ...A “Tree Trunk” Coat!Stepping back for the full effect.From the back!Up close picture of the fabric and stitching.  Looks like print out of a book.  Kind of an interesting feature since books are made from paper which comes from trees.Proof again that it can be worn. The materials listed  for this coat were:  fabric, paper, wood, vinyl.This is truly wearable art.  Art that is stepping outside the box of traditional definitions of “art.”  I loved it!! Beautifully created and stunningly displayed.  There was no fee to enter this art show but I would have paid to view these beautiful and imaginative garments. All the items in the show were priced for sale.  The metal dress was priced at $5,000.  The tree trunk coat was priced at $6,000.  While I am not an art collector - if I had the right setting in my home to displays these items, I would pay the price to own them.  Next time:  Part 2 - Everything else in the Art Show"},
{"title": "The View ... Peace.", "date": "Tuesday, November 2, 2021", "text": "The ocean is a peaceful place for me.  It is constant, it has a rhythm, it can be quiet and it can be loud.  And sometimes it can be fierce! Gratefully I have only seen its fierce face on TV.  Being this close to the ocean when it is in a bad mood is not an adventure I seek out.  But on this weekend, the ocean was quiet and mostly at rest.Nothing graces my eye and mind as the ocean, the sand, and the birds  ... elements in harmony along the continent's edge. Even with eyes closed, the sounds have a slow steady beat punctuated by intermittent bird cries. In the off seasons of fall and winter, the lack of human sound at shore line is like music.   Sadly, I get to visit seldom. But thankfully the ocean changes little from visit to visit.The view my first morning from the deck. It is all in this picture taken the first morning there.  All my favorite things. The ocean, small waves, the dune, my coffee, my knitting, and the sunrise with reflection on the water.I am an early riser generally.  Not by choice, but because my legs get irritable in the morning and I have to move or sometimes just get the heck out of bed!  So it was that morning.  And for a change my legs did me a favor.  Because I was up early before everyone else, I didn’t miss this beautiful sunrise image.At a later time I captured these shots.Unlike my walks at home that usually are done with my husband, I get the greatest pleasure walking alone, especially on the beach.  I don’t enjoy walking on soft sand, so on my own I am free to stop when I choose, to take pictures of something that catches my eye, to just stand and take in the glory of the ocean or watch the sea birds as they putter around on the sand.  Lately I have been in some turmoil and it was wonderful to just empty my mind out onto the shore line and let the ocean take it all away for a short time. I did cut over to the side walk along Ocean Highway for a bit to get my heart rate up and circulate the blood.  The view there is not much different than any other city, but it easier to walk when you have a temperamental left knee that doesn’t appreciate uneven surfaces.But the beach walk was just for me, the birds and the ocean.Next up: The Art Center"},
{"title": "On the Road ...", "date": "Sunday, October 31, 2021", "text": "Since my husband can no longer drive, I am the only driver - no matter where we go.  I don’t mind driving generally, but when someone else is doing the driving, it is a real treat to sit in the passenger seat.  My sister volunteered to drive so that I could knit on the trip.  I didn’t knit a stitch. Just ran my mouth the whole way, and it was lovely.Although I have driven to Ocean City many times, I have always taken the most common route - Route 50 to Route 90!  It takes you through several local Eastern Shore towns - like Easton and Cambridge and Salisbury.  None of them are particularly scenic - just groupings of every day communities with the store fronts providing the day-to-day residential needs and stop lights.But this time we followed a more easterly route to the shore that took us through a lot of farm lands. Route 404 is less congested with fewer cops monitoring out-of-towners. When it was time for a stop - a charming farm store attached to an orchard popped up just like we had ordered it.   Besides the fruit and vegetables they had some specialty vinegar and olive oils, like white balsamic peach flavored vinegar and garlic olive oil.  Using their selection of bottles, we got both of those. They also had wonderful bakery items and sandwiches - made to order.  We decided this was great place to stop and have lunch.When we left - we carried with us about 5 different desserts to share at the ocean and dog cookies.  Since we would only be 3 on this visit, we may have over-did-it on the desserts.Before you knew it we had reached the condo - The Phoenix - owned by my cousin.  One of the big advantages of this condo is that it was built before the time when Ocean City regulated just how close to the sand dunes you could build!  As a result the building is built further out near the sand dune by a number of yards.  And it is built right beside access to the beach. The balcony for the condo is on the right. Perfect view.Perfect view for this!  Hello, beautiful!And because it juts out being an original building, this is the view to the left off the balcony.  Unobstructed view of the dunes on the deck. The weather was beautiful - but, truthfully, there is no such thing as a bad day at the beach. Next up: The View ..."},
{"title": "A Trip - the prep and the 'all important' list!", "date": "Wednesday, October 27, 2021", "text": "I don’t get away from home often.  When the opportunity presents itself and my calendar is open, I go! But because I am not a frequent traveler, I probably need more preparation time than most people. My ‘trips' can be as simple as spending the weekend at my son’s house for house dog-sitting to traveling to a destination as far away as 2 1/2 hours. Ocean City, Maryland is about 2 1/2 hours away.  I had a chance to visit my friend, the ocean, ... and, oh yes, my cousin and my sister. 😄But it does take a bit of preparation for me to be gone.  Just like anyone else, I have to pack stuff.  I leave my canvas tote open in the dining room and drop stuff in when an item pops into my mind.  That is really helpful because lately my mind works like a ping pong ball bouncing off one idea and shooting off in an opposite direction to another.  I follow a check list I wrote up years ago.  I review that list the day before travel and right before I leave. As you can see, my check list needs to be updated, as I have run out of room to check off items for future trips.   It might seem a little over kill on the details, but I hate remembering what I missed while traveling on a fun trip. Relying on my memory has proved to be pretty unreliable.Then there are the things that must be done for my husband who is blind.  While some spouses are independent enough to do simple stuff like make a meal or perk the morning coffee, my husband can’t manage that without preparation on my behalf.  I also make sure that the floor and surfaces are picked up so he isn’t left to maneuver around lots of random objects in my absence.  And finally I remind my “back up” coverage (my kids) that I am gone so if he calls they are responsive.  He never calls - because he is fairly independent within the condo - but knowing I have that back up relieves my mind.   So my pre-departure list needs to be detailed since two of us are depending on it.  I don’t own any real luggage.  Various totes or bags work well enough for someone who doesn’t travel much. I don’t travel through airports so I don’t need luggage with wheels.  But the number of bags I use can get out of hand pretty quickly.There is the bag for clothing, medicine, and my pillow.  Yes, I can’t go anywhere without my old, very flat, soft pillow.  I have had that pillow for probably 15 years.  There isn’t much of it left, but it fits my head and keeps my neck from getting stiff.  And yes, my pillow is on my list!!There is the bag for my knitting projects.  I carry two current projects and sometimes a 3rd something - all relatively small.  No sizable projects like blankets or nearly done sweaters.   The knitters among you are probably scratching your heads.  \"What?  Only 3 projects?  Aren’t you afraid you will be left with nothing for your hands to do?” Ha! And sometimes my single project bag spills over into another bag with finished objects to show fellow crafters. But the goal is to keep it simple and carry only one bag.And then there is the bag for the food I bring as most of my trips involve a sharing food responsibilities. The contents of these bags (however many) are typically on the list - and if not, I find myself stressing days in advance about forgetting something.While not related to prep and packing - I notice that I don’t sleep well in advance of a trip.  Maybe if I traveled more - getting a good night’s rest before travel might not be an issue.  Practice makes perfect after all.Maybe I should add a few other things to the bottom of my list likeStop worrying.  (Check ✔)Shut your mind down. (Check ✔)Get some sleep. (Check ✔)Nope, not a good idea!  Leave no evidence behind that you are THAT anal!  (except on the blog!)Next up: On the road!"},

But by the time I open my front door to return, my thirst alert disappears entirely.  Yes, yes, I know, that is not normal, but a majority of my life was lived just like that.  Now as a senior, my water intake has become more important.  Hence the search for a fix ....Meet my new water bottle!  Or I should say, my latest new water bottle.  Lots of \"almost new\" water bottle clutter my kitchen cabinet and are failures for one reason or another.  What I really need is a water bottle with authority ... that has a hand that reaches out, grabs my collar and says “Drink!!”   But failing that feature, here is what this new bottle does provide that the others missed.It divides the water into time periods.  I can look at the bottle and think - oh, I am 2 hours behind.  So I drink down to the current time.It has a “waist.”  I can get my hand around it.  Many bottles are so fat that it isn’t comfortable in the hand.It has a handle that lets me carry it easily when walking.It has a tight seal so it doesn’t leak.It has a wide mouth that easily accepts ice.  Water without ice is still impossible for me.Nothing is perfect, so here are its 2 short-comings so far.It has a fat bottom so it doesn’t fit into my car’s cup holder.It sweats because of the ice.  It would be nice to have a thin insulation to prevent sweating.I certainly demand a lot from a water bottle, don’t you think?  The question is ... has it worked. Day 1 -  I drank my full 64 ounces of water or the required 2 fill ups!! Smashing success!  Day 2 -  I drank 32 ounces - only one fill up. Hmmm, ok ... more than the ‘none’ which is my normal.Day 3 -  The next day I drank only 16 ounces and I managed to forget the darn bottle at my son’s house. *sigh*. I was half way home when I discovered it was missing so I  turned around to get it.  I wouldn’t have done that for any other bottle.  I am not giving up.But seriously, isn't it stupid I can’t seem act like a grown up, go into the kitchen and fill a glass with water several times and day - and drink it - voluntarily?HOUSE PLANTSI finally have a cat who doesn’t eat plants!  Way To Go, Aja!!  Just a short detour on the plant news.  Here is a picture of Aja sleeping out in the living room.  She finally just this week showed she is comfortable sleeping near us outside the bedroom and by an open window with street noise - but only if there are no others about.And just now, for the first time in 17 months, I watched her clean herself!  She is always clean, so I knew she was grooming, but I never actually saw it.   Today ... another forward baby step in our relationship.Just Amazing! 😍And now the plants ....After 52 married years with cat companions and being forced to choose between cats and plants - I can now have both.  I live on the sunny side of the building.  This summer I got a few flowering geraniums that love the sun.  They remind me of my student teaching days in early 1969 when I had a mentor teacher, Mrs. Miller, who was still teaching at 70 (I am in my 70’s and just can’t imagine managing a class of 30 2nd graders at 70).  She had a row of geraniums that stretch the length of her class room along the windows. She pampered them every morning.These are hardy plants but sometimes have problems adjusting to the indoors in the fall (or that is what I read on line.)  Hoping these few will winter well enough indoors.What is the stupid part!  I obsess.  Every morning I check all the leaves and pick off the ones that look like they are failing.  I remove blossoms that are at the end of their blooming cycle.  Check the dirt for watering.  I move some indoors or move some out - looking for a stress reaction caused by changing locations.  Ever - single - morning. And while I am doing this I am pondering names for them.  Yep, names!You see, one of my geraniums came with the name:  Mrs. Pollock on her plant tag!  That is the actual name of the version of geranium she is.  She has the most beautiful tri-colored leaves.   Then I looked at the other plants.  Nameless!  So ... do YOU know anyone else who considered naming their plants?  I haven’t done any naming yet, but the thought crosses my mind now. What would be a good name for a geranium!  Here is a picture of Mrs. Pollock’s leaf.  She doesn’t need flowers for me because her leaves are so pretty.  But she is having the most trouble transferring to the indoors.  I am pretty sure there is a Giovanni somewhere in my group!!  Giovanni Geranium has a certain ring to it.  Or maybe Geronimo!! And then my mind drifted to ... those are male names.  hmmm ...  I wonder if Mrs. Miller had this problem.Can things get any more stupid?  MY NEIGHBOR (no pictures but a sad story)I live in a 55+ condo community so I live very close to other people.  Many original owners have died or moved away, but we still have a small percentage of the population well past their abilities to live independently.  And that was the case of my neighbor, (I’ll call her Jane.). Jane was a nice lady, but a little foggy.  She didn’t seem to have friends in the community, never attended owner meetings, never out for walk, hardly every made trips to the trash dumpster.  Once she mentioned watching her son’s children at his house. Ahh, I figured ... that's where her life and connections are. Still, it seemed odd that family or friends never visited her in her condo.  When we moved here neighbors shared that she liked to shop by mail.  It was common for 3 or 4 packages to be waiting in the foyer for her several times a week.  They whispered the word “hoarder” to me.  I felt bad that they shared this with me - a virtual stranger at that point. I was uncomfortable with this talk and would often pick up her packages from the first floor and set them by her door out of sight of judgemental eyes.  After all, she was hurting no one.  But over the 5 years she and I lived side by side, we were barely acquaintances. Three weeks ago I noticed big changes.  She had been gone for a long time it seemed.  Others were going in and out of her unit.  Many very large black trash bags filled the hallway. Those disappeared.  And more re-appeared, but disappeared again.  Later a junk truck pulled up behind the building and started to fill.  It arrived many more times that I noticed and was always full to the brim.  But I never saw Jane.  I began to worry that she had passed away.  At one point I stopped a lady going in - turns out it was her daughter from Florida (wow, I didn’t know she had a daughter ... who apparently never visited ...  sorry, that was unkind of me.) She assured me Jane was fine, had been hospitalized, and was in rehab. She would not be returning, but moving directly to Florida, and they (her brother and her) would be selling the unit.  Ok ... I felt some relief that family was finally stepping in to help her.So what is the stupid stuff?  For a woman who I barely knew - I felt sad.  In moving, her life and stuff, that she had so carefully hidden from the neighbors was suddenly on full display. While I am sure she could not participate in the condo clean up without saving everything,  it appeared that literally every decision regarding her stuff was lifted from her.   Of course other residents noticed this activity.  Word of this move passed beyond my building.  They commented on a single truck load of flattened boxes.  I heard the truck staff were pawing through other truck loads, pulling things out for themselves.  I am glad I didn’t see that.  Some residents were checking with others - how many trucks did you see? I wanted to shut down that talk.  But I kept my mouth shut.  I have to live here for probably another 10-15 years.  A neutral stance is better.But I did ponder my own future.  My over riding goal when cleaning out and downsizing - is that I take care of shedding my belongings myself and not become burden to my children (and after this experience avoid being the topic of idle discussion by the neighbors.)  You can be very sure, this episode planted thoughts in my mind that will not easily fade.  I guess, ... as I type this story for you, I realize this concern for a near stranger isn’t stupidity, but just common, run-of-the-mill, compassion for another human being.  It is compassion for an aging woman undergoing a big change imposed on her for her own good - but beyond her ability to contribute or control.  It is advancing age robbing a person of their independence. This is an emotion am very familiar with as I lived with this thought every day when caring for my own aging mother.  And it is a reminder to me that I still have control - for now.  Here’s hoping Jane is in a better place in Florida - with a fresh start at life and new neighbors who don’t know all her secrets and a daughter nearby for support.And as for myself, I won’t raise any ‘red flags’ for my family to worry about - like putting name tags on my geraniums.  We will just keep that little secret between you and I. 😂"},
{"title": "My Left Thumb and Aja", "date": "Saturday, October 16, 2021", "text": "Here is a bit more of what has filled my time since July from the perspective of my Left Thumb.(Yes, my left thumb!)My left thumb has registered a significant objection recently.  Who knew that it had opinions!?!  That is an unfortunate evolution because I am in the thick of crocheting 2 sizable projects which I have every intention of finishing and I suspect my new craze - crocheting - is the cause of this thumb revolt. All my other fingers are agreeable to my creative needs.  Since my thumb seems to be full of opinions lately, I thought I would give it an opportunity to express some of them now.So here we go!Annie Crochet Striped Afghan Club in Plumberry - almost done.  (Vote from the thumb 👎)I am nearing the end of this project. I was really drawn to this club because not only did you get a the yarn and pattern instructions for 3 different stripes once a month, but you are given access to the video tutorials.  For me the video tutorials were invaluable. I have learned a lot using this club, but I am still not comfortable with the written instructions or the crochet charts with all the odd ball graphic designs the look like Chinese picture writing to me.  Regardless, I love working on this blanket and would consider another Annie’s Club - maybe a knitting club. (from the thumb 👍)One last pleasant discovery.  The acrylic yarn used is Premier Anti Pilling Everyday Worsted.  I had never heard of it before, but the colors are pure, the feel is very natural, there is no splitting and the stitches are sharp in definition.  My favorite acrylic now.  And it can be found at various yarn websites.Queen Blanket (vote from my thumb 👎) This blanket made with mosaic crochet looks intricate but really it is so simple. The technique of mosaic crochet is a bit time consuming and the size makes this a long term project.  Still, the result is eye catching and very enjoyable to work on. The will be a very big project and will take more than a year so more crocheting is in my future (from the thumb 👎!!!)Shelley Scarf/Wrap (vote from the thumb 👍)My left thumb loves this project so I’ve made a lot of progress on this knitted project. This project has a simple 2 row repeat and one row is a purl row.  How simple can it get!  Apparently, for me, the simpler the pattern, the more likely mistakes occur.  Luckily, it is fairly forgiving pattern as it is pretty easy to correct a mistake in the previous row from the purl row.  In fact, if you use the right yarn - mistakes can be corrected anywhere in the pattern.  I had to make 2 corrections by actually sewing up errors  (almost like darning) with a separate piece of yarn and weaving in those ends.  Once done, it is pretty invisible.  In a solid color, that might not work, but my yarn has variations of shades.And now on to my little Princess 👍👍👍:AJAAja is so much fun.  Little habits that she repeats and trusted moments that she dispenses (when the time is right for her, of course) are lovely to see.  Her latest game is playing catch with our feet as we walk..  Claws are in - and she does a tap tap on our ankles.  If you turn, she stops, looks, then runs away. Sort of a version of the game of Tag. At first we didn’t know what she was doing.  But she does it frequently with both of us.  She also is fond of jumping onto my lap in the evenings.  It is pretty much the only pictures I get.  And she doesn’t really care if you have knitting or a computer on your lap.  When she is coming up - she is coming!When Aja was new to us she was a little 'black box' that was filled with mystery.  When you get a kitten, their black box is totally empty (sort of like their kitten brain - totally empty.) 😁  Adult cats have stuff hidden in their black box.   In her early days with us I made contact with her previous owner through Facebook.  We had a few lovely messages back and forth, and I learned a lot about Aja that she was keeping hidden.  From those Facebook chats there is a phrase that is stuck in my head.  But her previous owner said, “Thank you for giving her a chance.”  Awww ... \"Giving her a chance...”  I guess that is what it looked like we were doing.  But what Aja and her previous “mama” could not know was - this wasn’t a “chance.”  There was no chance that it might not work out.  There was no “chance” that we would return her to the shelter (which I am quite sure does happen.)  Even if we would only have a marginal distant relationship with her, she was staying.  Aja landed in a home that didn’t rely on chances.  She was ours - for better or worse!  That is how we roll.That’s all folks!!  When she is done, she is done.  I get tapped with her tail a few time in departing and then she is off to other things.I am a persistent person - if it takes a year - if it takes 10 years, if I want to do something, I am going to do it.  And I wanted to conquer this little cat’s fear and distrust. And I think I have.  But that one comment has stuck with me anyway.  \"Thank you for giving her a chance.”  Aja has proved she is worth many, many, chances.  As many chances as it takes - and almost all pets deserve that - unlimited chances because the circumstances of their past lives are really not of their making. She was lucky on several counts.  She had a good life before us and she has a good life now.  We love our little Aja, and I think she finally loves us.I checked on Facebook and her former mama has removed her Facebook page content.  Only her name is there.  I left a message for her hoping she gets it.  I got the sense she really loved this little cat and was upset that Aja was in the shelter 2 weeks before someone took her.  I can’t imagine how hard it was to know her little Aja couldn’t make the move to another state with her.  I am hoping she remembers to check in on this blog to see how Aja is doing.  She is doing just great. (from the thumb 👍).👍 Now that I have given the stage (so to speak) to my left thumb, I am hoping that it will start to settle down.  A compression glove, cold packs, no crocheting for 3 weeks and regular applications of Penetrex (an inflammation cream) have had limited success.  Maybe giving it the opportunity to get a few things off its chest (do thumbs have chests?) will do the trick!So what have I learned today.  Thumbs have opinions, perspectives and chests. Thumbs hate crocheting, but thumbs can’t speak so they are limited to emojis.  I have also learned to be grateful that this little 2-3 inch portion of my body is the only part putting up a fuss.  At my age, that is a fact to be celebrated.(Now hunting around to find some wood to knock on!!!)"},
{"title": "Maybe a New Title", "date": "Monday, October 11, 2021", "text": "I am thinking of changing my blog name to “My Next 20 Years of Living: A Year at a Time.”  I am slipping into the habit of posting only a few times a year!  I often think maybe I should just close the blog down.  I can see how it will all play out in my mind.  Do a graceful exit speech ...  you know ... taking a bow, wishing everyone well, throwing kisses to the crowd (if anyone is still out there reading - ha!), heading off to new but unidentified adventures, and drawing the curtains on this blog.  Then I remember, when I started in 2010 I thought 20 years was forever into the future.  But from where I am standing now - my “next 20 years” from 2010 takes me out to 2030.  Wow, that is pretty darn close.  It isn’t “forever.”  And I will be 83 in 2030.   83!  Hard to wrap my mind around that number.  hmmm .... isn’t 83 the “new 63?”  haha! Nope, not even I believe that.So I talk myself out of quitting.After all I still have things going on.  My wonderful kids are in the prime of their lives.  Professional and personal success.  Living comfortably, raising an amazing new generation and just generally improving the world with their presence.  I still have a life partner of 52 years and counting.  Turns out he needs me now more than he did when we first married.  (Its hard to express just how important vision is until you lose it.). Then there is Aja, our adult 'Covid Cat adoption.' God knows she keeps us amused and engaged.  And I still have not knitted through ALLLL my yarn stash yet (which means - if that is a goal - I will need to live to 115!)  Topping all that off, there is this amazing grand daughter in my life who is 3.  Now that is one little human being who is going to change the world.  If I live to be 115 - I might just get to see it.Nope!  Not quitting.  So what has been happening since July.First off my darling, amusing and smart-as-a-whip grand daughter is a regular part of my life.  Here she is carrying her Minnie Mouse leather purse her father (my talented son) made for her.  She thinks her dad can do anything (and I am hard pressed to disagree with her. 😁)Here she is getting ready to go out on a boat with her dad. Her honorary uncle owns the boat is putting her life vest on. (That face says: Yah! I am cool.)And here is a special cookie her grand mother (me) got for her loaded with icing.  Yummy - so she says.A sugar high (and low) in the making!And here is her first day of preschool picture - the first of many!What to say about this little person!  She is not only smart and can talk circles around you, she is a competitive 3 year old.  In August she went to the beach with family and extended family for the first time.  In that group was Will, her cousin, who is 4 years old.  The age difference of 6 months was nothing in their relationship.  Some conversations that were overheard were:Will:  I am 4 years old.Esk:   Well, I am 5!  (Poor Will lost that one - even though it was based on an exaggeration of the           truth. Ok, a lie. But still ... )Will:  My dad can jump on one leg.Esk:   Well, my dad has 2 legs!!!  (Sorry Will.  Looks like you lost that one, too.  But the dads had           fun with it.  My son reminded Will’s dad ALL week, that HE had 2 legs.  And Will’s dad has 2           legs as well, but let’s not let a little bit of logic get in the way of winning one!  Right, Esk!)I wish I could have been there.  Watching and listening to the 2 of them together would have been truly priceless.  My first video upload is below and I sure hope it works for you.  This is a movie of Esk and Will dancing together by the pool.  When I am feeling low, I watch this 1 minute and 20 second video and I feel myself smiling and laughing.  Hope you feel that way too.So I guess the question is why wasn’t I there?  Well the Outer Banks is 5-6 hours away from home and I feel uncomfortable being so far away leaving my husband with no back up (both my kids were on this trip.). So I made myself useful and stayed with my son and daughter-in-laws two dogs.  A dog week for me - I used to do that kind of house and dog sitting all the time before the pandemic - but the pandemic changed all that.  So here are my pictures from that same week.They like to stay close.  Very close.  Sometimes it is a little claustrophobic, but they need more attention when “their peoples’ are gone.They have a beautiful side porch that the dogs and I completely enjoyed sitting on.This bulldog is Ragnar - Rags for short.  Getting a front picture of him is hard when he was determined to put his butt on my lap keeping me close.This is Olivia - Livvy or Beansie for short.  She isn’t quite so clingy but loves attention just as much.Yes, that is 60+ pound Rags running full out down the hill in their fenced in yard - directly at me.  I have learned never to move when he does that.  He darts to the side at the last minute and invariably he darts in the direction I have chosen to move - taking me out!  He hasn’t master stopping all that well! He is such a character. The location of their house is wonderful - acres between houses, lots of green and trees, neighbors are far enough away that there is tons of privacy and lovely silence.I did lots of reading and knitting and crocheting and TV Netflix watching - and mid-day visited my husband till after dinner.  Sort of a mini-vacation for me as well.This was a long post and I’ll close it for now.  I’ll be back because I have pictures of my projects to share and Aja pictures to include.  And who knows, maybe some other stuff as well.Nope - not quitting yet.  Who would I bore with my pictures if not you wonderful people!Till next time ..."},
{"title": "Still Here", "date": "Sunday, July 18, 2021", "text": "I am still here ... just not very productive in the blog world.  But life has marched on regardless ... and here is a summary of me running to catching up to it. MiloA sad event.  Although I don’t own a dog, I have been an active participant and “grandma\" to my children’s dogs.  The 3 dogs shown in this picture grabbed my heart for the whole of their lives just as securely as if they lived with me full time.  From left to right: Meathead, Milo, and Grimace in much younger days.Meathead and Grimace passed away many years ago taking pieces of my heart with them.  Milo died last weekend at the age of 11 after a long struggle with pneumonia.  He was the last of this trio to leave us and my heart aches for him so much.  I hate that he is gone.  As searingly painful it is to let them go ... and to stand with them as their heart stops and they take their last breath ... it is a final loving gift of comfort for them surrounded by \"their people” in those last moments.  This was my daughter’s first experience with euthanasia.  So the pain was particularly intense for me watching her part from her most beloved best friend, Milo. You lived a long life fully devoted to my daughter who is now missing you terribly. Your grandma is missing another part of her heart.Rest In Peace my sweet boy. AjaAja continues to surprise us.  This past May she passed her one year anniversary with us.  Just when I think she has reached her full level of comfort with us, she moves forward another step.  I don’t think people realize (or in some cases accept) the amount of time that is needed for an adult pet adoption. If she is looking a little chubby in that picture - it is because she has gained some weight.  When she came she was a gaunt 7.8 pounds.  I suspect she didn’t eat much during those 2 weeks at the shelter.  At her last check up she was over 10 pounds.  She loves her meal times.  And we carefully cater to her likes and dislikes.Here are her ‘achievements' since I last wrote (No photographic proof, of course.  She avoids any documentation that she is evolving.  She would loose her “cat credentials” if she allowed pictures of her exploits.🤣)Jumps on the bathroom counter top. Seriously, I didn’t think she could jump at all - she did it so seldom. Now she leaps up like it is no big deal!  How she disguises her abilities!! Jumps up on the bed when my husband and I are both on it - big WOW!Lays beside my husband when he is lying on the bed - not for a long time and not all that frequently - but Aja is all about baby steps.  My husband was so stunned when she did this the first time, he didn’t want to move - or even breathe, fearing he would scare her off.  She was definitely “testing” the waters.  Always testing!Roams the condo many times a day.  A bit skittish when she does it, but is learning to be daring!Has picked a living room window to watch the world from that is not in the bedroom. That would be her “chubby” picture above.We are really happy she is our “special girl.\"EskarinaWe have finally reached the point of normalcy in grand daughter visitation.    What an amazing little person she is becoming.  Although she is not vaccinated yet, being only 3 years old, everyone around her is vaccinated so the circle of protection is safe for all.Her use of language continues to astound me.  Such sentence structure and complexity of thought coming from that little mind!  Of course, now that she can parrot back everything she hears, adult speech has to be carefully monitored.  No “f” bombs - as my son recently discovered!  😂 All words are fair game in the mind of a 3 year old.  Knitting /CrochetFor me, this is the Year of the Blanket apparently!  No pictures yet but soon. I am working on two afghans now, and one or two more are waiting in the wings to be started.  And ironically they are ALL crochet!!  I also want to knit a sweater for my grand daughter.  She has finally reached the age where she won’t outgrow a handmade item in 3 months.In other areas ...As I grieve the passing of Milo, my normal reaction is to clean, declutter, re-organize. Basically just keep moving.  Action and distraction lifts me out of obsessing out of my sadness for a time.  Sitting still and thinking about the loss makes the whole grieving process so intense.  Walking would do the same thing, but the heat outside right now would sap my strength, so staying busy inside air conditioning is the next best thing.Yesterday I vacuumed and steamed cleaned the carpets.  It is a job that takes hours because I also try to move things to reach areas that normally don’t get cleaned.  As much as I would like to replace this 18+ year old wall-to-wall carpeting, it cleans up beautifully when it has been steamed cleaned. It is just a lot of work to do it.  Next up - the pantry and the fridge.  Both need attention.  And in my walking around I routinely simplify the spaces and surfaces in my condo.  After years of having tons of bricka-a-bracka all over every surface, I now find peace in cleared spaces.  As it turns out, it also helps my blind husband who would find maneuvering around “stuff” very difficult.We also did a few big things this year.  This winter we replaced all the windows.  Part of that process was stripping them of the double hung drapes the previous owner had installed.  I am not fond of curtains or drapes but I kept them for 4+ years while doing other big improvements.  I am very pleased with the blinds we installed this spring.  They are the traditional size - not mini - and they are white with gray highlights similar to the markings of wood.  My carpet is gray so it works well.  They have a nice header and are complete as they are without the trappings of additional drapery.  Simple clean lines.This coming August we will be in this condo for 5 years.  The list of condo improvements seems enormous when looking back.  New windows and window treatments throughout, new kitchen appliances, a new bathroom toilet in the guest bath, a new garbage disposal, 3 new lights/ceiling fan combinations, a new screen door for the deck, a new deck light, 3 new10-year smoke alarms, and a new air conditioner.  With each change this condo feels more like my space and less like someone else’s space I am visiting - a feeling that still haunts me at times.  Next year we will probably tackle the flooring.  And there are other items that need a more current update. But I may change my mind on all these future changes.  They will be expensive and very disruptive.  When I was 30 or 40, or even 50, I could anticipate staying put in a home and enjoying the improvements for another 20 years or so.  Now, at 74, our future is harder to predict. We may have reached the point that condo improvements would not be a good use of money or time. Time marches on.If I could just slow down that marching of time ... or even just roll it back a bit so I could give that dear dear grand dog Milo - one more hug.That’s all for now.  Hope it isn’t months before I write again. Thanks for stopping by."},
{"title": "Commenting on the Comments", "date": "Saturday, April 10, 2021", "text": "I rarely respond to comments and questions on my blog now that I use the Pop Up commenting.  I can’t reply in real time on the same post unless I choose to add a separate comment of my own to my post.  I am not sure if that method of reply would be seen since most people never look backwards on the blogs they follow.  Then I got to thinking ... why not have a “Reply Post” that follows the main post a few days later.  So here is my Reply Post.  We will see how this goes.”Have you made a date [to see Esk] with dear Eskarina and her parents?”  YES!!  I should have mentioned that in my previous post.  In fact, the date was scheduled on my calendar the very first moment I snagged the first shot date!!  I went right to my calendar and counted out the days and marked my “Liberation Day” in bold red print. And there will be a blog post, Michelle, when it happens. “Liberation Day” is April 20 around 12:30 pm (yes I know the time as well) -  not that I am counting the minutes or anything.   However, she goes to day care during the workweek so we are holding off our reunion until the weekend when we have a “Sleep over at Grandma’s\" condo all planned on April 23.  It will be joyous in the extreme.  I hope I can get through the first hour of the visit without crying.  Even in the Google Video calls with her - which do happen frequently - I can see that she has grown and matured.  During one of those video calls Esk asked me if I could show her the toys and her bed at my house through the phone 😢.  As I \"walked her” on the phone into the guest room, I was fighting tears. While it is lovely she remembered these things and wanted to see them again,  it made me so sad that the only way we could do that was through a cell phone.   And although I am looking forward to seeing her parents as well, I know they are just as eager to have some time to themselves - even if it is just to get some sleep.  😄And as for Aja!  She is definitely a female, Cynthia.  And I can assure you that the difference between female and male cats is like different solar systems.  The males (we have had 9 of those) are the party, party, party animals.  Pretty much happy-go-lucky!  More dog-like than cat-like.  The females (we have had 2 counting Aja) are the business end of the species.  It is nature’s way of assuring that kittens will survive.  Even in the wild, the female lions are the hunters and the male lions are the “figure heads” who wait for the meal to be brought down by their female mates. The true power is in the female.  It is probably true of most mammals.  It is just more evident in animals like cats - who are unlikely to hide their true nature.I also learned some interesting things about orange female cats yesterday.  Orange females are relatively rare. This info came from another female orange cat owner who asked if Aja’s personality was “spicy.”  Why, funny you should ask.  Yes!  What a perfect description of her personality.  Spicy. This informal source said spicy personalities are a common trait of orange females.  So off I went to Google to do a little research.  Yes,  pretty much all sources agree - about 81% of ginger cats are male.  Ginger females carry the orange gene on both X chromosomes.  Both her parents had to be orange according to the sources I read.  But the “spicy” personality observation was not supported.  In fact, it was suggested be  the reverse.  While the strongest influence on personality tends to be early socialization, males tend to be the “spicier” of the two.  That observation does not appear to be based on any science like the color of the fur.  You can’t help but wonder, however, ... since there is only observational evidence on personality, maybe there is something to it - just not proven.  Everyone agrees, however, that orange cats are very friendly.  And Aja is.  She just doesn’t always know how to contain that joyous feeling at times.Terra, Leigh, Marie and Lefty, thank you for your kind comments on the crochet.  I am definitely a novice in crochet.  The actual stitches aren’t hard but knowing where to begin and end rows still is sometimes a mystery.  Last year I started a crochet blanket and got about 5 inches done when I discovered the blanket was getting wider.  Obviously I had been unintentionally increasing on the edges.  I ripped it all out and decided crochet just wasn’t for me.  Then I discovered the Annie’s Club Kits - I liked the patterns and each kit came with video assistance. You could see quite clearly where the hook needed to go to begin or end.  While the cost of the total Kit is pretty high for what is acrylic yarn, the assistance and knowledge building more than make up for the cost.  And when you commented on the colors in the blanket I had to smile. I like browns and tans also, but there are no browns and tans in the blanket.  I tried so hard to capture the colors and failed miserably.  The colors are in the plum family with a pop of turquoise for contrast.  Even the professional pictures that came with the directions don’t show the colors correctly.Finally to my walking friend, Karen, Happy One.  I think of you often and how lucky you are to have such a beautiful place to walk every single day (for 6 miles - yes, folks, she walks 6 miles every day - my hero!)  While our move to this condo was perfect in many ways, walking paths or even just sidewalks are in short supply in Elkridge.  It is not Columbia, where the developers were following the vision of James Rouse with pedestrian friendly neighborhoods. And Sandy, your idea for audio books while walking is something I used to do when I was on my own walk.  It does pass the time.  I am trying to get out later in the evening by myself when he has gone to bed.  He is an early to bed (7:00 pm) but late to sleep (10:00 pm) person - listening to his audio books for a few hours before sleeping.  With the longer days this works ok.  I get in a short walk around my condo development. (boring, but walking). But I miss wandering around randomly and spontaneously like Happy One does. Not sure how this worked for you guys.  I feel like I closed the loop on the last post with responses.  I probably won’t be back blogging again until I see Esk - in the flesh - on the 23rd - with a box of tissues in my hand and my other arm around her slim little body.    Stay well all!"},
{"title": "A \"Don’t Fence Me In” Update", "date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2021", "text": "The habit of writing seems to be lost on me of late!  The thought of writing pops up at regular intervals but the action seems absent.  Lately, if there is a structure to anything in my life - I seem to resist it!  Regardless, I am here now, so update time.COVID-19 VACCINATION updateI am within a week of being fully vaccinated - meaning that I will soon pass the 2 week waiting period after the 2nd shot.  I won’t be barred from seeing my family anymore (specifically my dearest grand daughter.)  FREEDOM!  But I have been fortunate in this pandemic.  No illness and little to no reaction to either shot.   But I will continue mask wearing and social distancing until we are closer to herd immunity ... because that is the sensible, logical and the “adult” thing to do - until we ALL can be free!!DIET update I spent time thinking about my diet - not for weight loss but mostly for health.  I finally settled on a mostly Mediterranean diet.   But it isn’t really ‘mediterranean' if you aren’t being semi compliant!  In the end I settled on listening to my body’s needs! And what is needs are smaller meals, more veggies, less meat, lower carbs and no 'no-nos!’ That is as much limitation as I am willing to do.EXERCISE updateI miss walking.   Walking \"my way.\"  And during this pandemic,  any kind of walking has been scarce.  I refuse to blame the pandemic. Nothing has kept me from going outside and walking during these months.  Nothing but myself and one small deterrent.What is most satisfying about walking is the solitary time, walking by myself.  Setting my own pace, viewing the scenery, thinking about things - mind drifting, no socialization or expectations.  But my husband also needs to walk and due to is disabiity, he cannot walk alone.  Oh I know there are blind folks who can do absolutely everything independently, but those kind of people are very rare when you lose vision as a senior.  That means when I walk (with him) I am \"on duty.\"  I have to be on alert the whole time to make sure the obsticals are announced or avoided, always checking our pace since he has exactly one speed - fast - but he doesn’t have the heart and lung capacity for that speed any more.  His mind drifts, he forgets to “listen” to the messages his cane gives him.   I know it sounds (and feels) a little selfish to want to have some alone time on my walks.  But the only fix for this is to find time for 2 walks a day.  Working on this.CLEANING OUT updateI joined a blog event last fall called Making Space. But as I suspected, I found the discipline of blogging about it hard.  I enjoy reading the posts of others, but I am happy to clean out on my own when the spirit moves me.  My current decluttering has focused on exercise tapes and cook books.  I get absolutely NO satisfaction out of exercising indoors.  If I am forced to exercise inside, I prefer to have a list of exercises that I can do while I watch some sort of distracting TV.  And yet I had a shelf and a half of exercise disks - each one I thought would be “the one” that helped me get in shape indoors. I am down to about 5 disks.  Big declutter there. I hardly ever crack open a cookbook.  Same logic - I buy the book thinking this is “the one” that will help me enjoy cooking.  I will make wonderful tasty things from that book. Never! When I want a new recipe, I just hop on my computer and print something out.  I have several loose leaf binders of recipes I have pulled from the internet that I use when menu building.  I have donated a great number of cookbooks, and now I am in the process of cannibalizing a few - pulling out any recipes I made that were good, but never repeated because ... well ... hardly ever crack open a cookbook.Funny, I never thought I would get rid of exercise tapes and favorite cookbooks.  And here I doing both.KNITTING AND CROCHETING updateScarf - my only knitting project right now. Finger weight yarn and it will take a long time finish because ...... I started an Annie’s Club project called Plumberry Sampler Afghan in crochet.  This is an indoor shot of the first 6 rows of this Afghan.  The colors are hard to capture correctly.This is an outdoor shot and the colors are closer to normal.  And even with natural light, the colors don’t show as true.I am enjoying working on this - it is a great crochet learning project.  And the yarn they use for this is wonderful stuff.  Acrylic, but hard to tell without the label.Queen blanket, also crochet, is well underway.  This is the most satisfying project I am working on at present.  No pictures to share yet but the finished object should look something like this.My colors will be somewhat different, but you get the idea.  It really is a fun and easy project.And then there is this little lady, Aja.Yes, that is a smug and self-satisfied face.  Don’t those eyes say it all.  She has made large strides with my husband.  And he has put great effort into it.  Several times a day, he goes into the bedroom to “visit” Aja.  He sits on the bed and she jumps up and rubs and rubs and rubs - and he pets - and usually it ends peacefully.  She gets herself over stimulated ending in a hiss or a swipe, but that is more rare now.  Oh, she does come out of the bedroom and wanders around the condo regularly, but she is most comfortable where her two beds are and food and litter - and she has safety behind the gate at the bedroom door (it has a cat door in it - and no one but her can pass through.) So she can come out any time she wants.Here she is behind my recliner.  And if you look close, Milo is in the recliner.  Guess she felt the coast was clear if he was asleep.Next month it will be the first anniversary of her adoption.  She has come sooo far since that skinny frightened and distrustful cat came to live with us.  Change is hard for her.  Not everyone could give her the time and distance she needed to adjust.  I kind of feel like she was just meant to be with us.  We love her so much and she has shown in her own way that those feelings are returned.I think I hit all the topics.  Until next time ..."},
{"title": "February Wrap Up!!", "date": "Tuesday, March 9, 2021", "text": "Slipped off the blogging radar again.  The whole month of February - just gone!  How does that happen.Thankfully nothing negative was involved.  Just time getting away from me.  Lets see what I can do to catch up.I finished the knitted blanket I made for my grand daughter - it is a blanket she will use here - should we ever get back to normal times and she can visit again.  I was glad to be done with it.  It was huge and easy to work on in a mindless fashion, but I had other stuff I was itching to get to!Then we had a little scare with this old man “grand child,” my daughter’s dog Milo!  He had some breathing issues and she got an initial evaluation from her vet with an X-ray ... the vet thought he had lung tumors - probable cancer - and at his age, extensive testing was just not an option.  Quality of life care was the recommendation ... and maybe some steroids to slow down the tumor growth and make him comfortable.  Her vet wanted him seen by a vet internist to evaluate and make suggestions since he is already on pain meds for his back issues.  That visit provided a different opinion, thankfully and it is not cancer.  But without expensive testing and maybe some uncomfortable treatments involving anesthesia, (also not an option), a definitive diagnosis could not be given.  At present we are just content that it is not cancer. Making him comfortable in his very senior years is now the goal.And after the scare of maybe losing him, I found this charming picture of him when he wasn’t so gray. Now his is the wall paper on my computer screen.  My daughter isn’t going to be the only one devastated by his passing.  We just need to enjoy him now.This month my grand daughter turned 3.  We, of course, could not be with her so her parents held a virtual Birthday Party using Zoom.  All her family joined her on the computer and we enjoyed watching her open her presents and eat cake.  (Have I said recently just how much I HATE this pandemic?). I think I could tolerate it better if I had full access to my family.And here I am in line (6 feet apart, of course) at CVS waiting to get my first Covid VAX shot just yesterday.  The effort required to get that appointment was just too much.  So many people and not enough vaccines.  But I am grateful I managed to get onto a schedule. I have had no reaction to this first shot, but I understand that the second shot does produce some fatigue. My second shot is scheduled for the end of the month.  Of course, now I start all over again trying to get my husband on a schedule for his shots.  I check the schedules for 3 pharmacies, 2 max vaccine mega sites and the health department when I wake before I even have coffee and about 6 more times during the day and last thing before I go to bed at night.  It just never ends.I have started 2 more new projects - both are crochet.  The first picture is a sample of a technique called mosaic crochet.  This is new to me.  The pattern is from the Queen blanket (on Ravelry) that I plan to make very soon.  This Queen blanket was part of a CAL last fall and it has extensive video support on YouTube. For the sample I chose 2 light colored yarns - which was stupid.  The patterning would be so much more dramatic with more contrast. The yarn I have purchased for this pattern has plenty of contrast so it should be more fun - and the pictures will be better.The second project is from Annie’s Craft Club.  I kept getting ads for this club in my Facebook feed.  I finally just gave up and started the club. The blanket is striped and each stripe is a different crochet stitch.  The acrylic yarn is called Premier Anti Pilling Everyday Worsted and it is my new favorite acrylic. It doesn’t split, the colors are really lovely (although my photos don’t do it justice) and it is very soft.  Feels nothing like typical crunchy acrylic.  This project, too, has video support which I follow very carefully.  I am mostly a knitter and I know the basic crochet stitches, but I have learned so much from watching both videos.  Being able to “read” your knitting or your crochet is so important.  I understand the structure of the knit stitch very well - and these projects with their video support are helping me understand the crochet stitch at a much better level.  I am really enjoying both very much.Anyway, that is my February all summed up in a single post.  Hope that all of you are doing well - and staying well.  We are so close to the “finish line” of this pandemic now that a vaccine is finally available.  Everyone, keep wearing your masks and stay 6 feet apart ... and if you are able, please get vaccinated so we can all return to a normal life with herd immunity in place."},
{"title": "Puzzles - Winter Themes and Current Challenge", "date": "Sunday, January 31, 2021", "text": "Seems my puzzle completions have gotten ahead of my blogging!I finished this winter puzzle called After The Snow Has Fallen by artist Joseph Holodook purchased through Bits and Pieces. The theme of snow matches what I see outside my window right now.  SNOW! It was fun and not very hard.  Maybe a week to complete.  I do enjoy these simpler art pieces where the colors and the lines are pretty well delineated without out much guessing involved as to where they should go.The second puzzle I finished is another wintery scene called Home Again, artist H. Hargrove and purchased through Bits and Pieces as well. This one was little harder due to the blending of colors but even so ... not hard.Left side of the puzzle.Right side of the puzzle.This puzzle, however, had a tricky element to it.  Pictured below on the left is a bush that appears to have need of more bush pieces to complete the image.  There were no more bush pieces!  I got out my magnifier to see if the pieces I put into place really look like they belonged.  They did, line, color and shape.  But obviously not right because I had no free bush pieces left to place.  (Images below) Then I started mixing up the arrangement of the pieces based on shape alone ... and the picture on the right shows the finished bush.  What I have noticed with the Bits and Pieces puzzles is that the way they cut the pieces sometimes results in incorrect placement - even if the shape and picture seem to match.  Not sure if that is common across other puzzle brands or not, but it has soured me a bit on Bits and Pieces puzzles.  I have a few more to complete but will be interested in seeing if this if this is true with other brands.Currently I am working on a Disney puzzle called Tangled which is the Disney version of the story of Rapunzel.  I plan to glue the pieces together, frame and give to my grand daughter for her play room.This 500 piece puzzle is only 14” x 18” and the pieces are measurably smaller that the other 500 piece puzzles I did which ran 18” x 24”.  The pieces show small bits of blended colors and is making this much more of a challenge.  But the picture is beautiful.  Tangled is part of a 4 puzzle set - all 500 pieces and all 14” x 18” and all painted by Thomas Kinkade Studios. The other 3 puzzle themes are Lady and the Tramp, Mickey Mouse as the Sorcerer’s Apprentice from Fantasia, and Winnie the Poo.  I suspect they all will be somewhat challenging because they are all done by the same artist in the same size pieces."},
{"title": "Aja and The New Windows", "date": "Wednesday, January 20, 2021", "text": "Time for another Aja update.  I don’t think I have ever done this with any of my previous cats ... regular updates to share adjustment progress.  Nope!  But all those cats came to us as kittens - moldable as clay!  No big deal.  Aja came fully formed with a life and experiences before us ... and as such, she has been evolving on her own schedule with every month that passes! And, of course, she had an owner who loved her before and wanted to know how she was doing!  She is doing great!  And then I threw a sledge hammer into that delicately built relationship we have worked on. I decided to do something very big, very messy, very noisy and somewhat cold!  The big event that happened this month were window replacements - all 10 windows in the condo were ripped out in what appeared to be a very noisy demolition.  See, I got this great idea in October (when the weather was moderate) that a major home improvement project during a pandemic made perfect sense.  But what I didn’t count on was a January instillation.  All ten windows were removed at once - letting in all the wonderfully cold January air (not!).  And, of course, there was noise!!! Lots and lots of it.  And there were 4 strange men walking in her condo, walking in her sacred bedroom where even the dog isn’t allowed.  And they were making very big holes in her bedroom walls.  And they were here from 8:30 am until 3:00!!  And it was cold.  As this was all going on, all I could think was ... we are going to lose all the ‘brownie points’ we had accumulated with our little Diva, and we would be starting ALL OVER AGAIN!  Sigh!You can’t see her but she is hiding behind the laundry basket.After all, we had achieved a lot ... “lap time” on both our laps!  Yes, she had even taken to visiting my husband - the blind guy who stepped on her the very first night!  Whatever was I thinking when I scheduled this back in October.  Well ... what I was thinking was that the windows would be installed as promised in early December when it would be warmer.  And I sincerely didn’t understand that ripping out old windows was such a destructive process. As the work was going on, I started to worry that Aja, who was hunkered down in my husband’s closet might decide to come out and sit on the window sill - where there WASN’T A WINDOW THERE ANYMORE.  I was fixated on that thought. My God.  She could fall.  I tried to encourage her to come out so I could put her in our bathroom - where it was warmer, and had litter, had food and her comfy cube bed. Nope!  She wasn’t moving.  In fact, she looked at me as if she didn’t know who I was!! My husband assured me that Aja was definitely not leaving her hiding place to sit on any window sill - not with all these men and the noise!  The condo temperature surprisingly didn’t drop below 50 degrees.  We sat around in our coats freezing but the temperature really was reasonable.New and Improved.When all was said and done ... the job was completed, the 4 men left, the heat was back on and the quiet returned ... out she came!! Like nothing had happened!  All was right in her \"Diva World!\"  Amazing.  How she recovers from stuff is one of the measures I have used to see how she is really adjusting and how confident she is.  How well she “recovers” from a trauma.  In the first few months any interruption in the routine took a day or more before we saw her again.  Now ... within the first hour ... she struts out like she is reclaiming her kingdom!All in all - I think she has decided this is definitely her homeand we are definitely her servants!  And she is definitely right on both counts!!"},
{"title": "The Diet Game Decision", "date": "Monday, January 18, 2021", "text": "After days of reading, researching and experimenting a bit ... I have come to a sort of decision.At my age and with my long experience with eating - (ha!) - I know that my ability to adhere to a strict eating regimen will fail eventually even if I am successful for months and months.  It comes down to a simple fact.  I need listen to my body better to feel better - and a structured regimen change with lots of rules and no-nos just never works for long.  Thankfully the current messages coming from my body fall in line most closely with the Mediterranean diet way of eating, but with a few modifications that I know are realistic for me.  So, let the transition begin.What does transition look like for me:There will be no \"kitchen purging\" - an activity I typically did in the past when I attempted to eat differently.  Items we would normally eat will stay and get used up. But the ’seed’ change will happen in the grocery store - by purchasing the right options recommended.  That means simply, that I will be weaning myself off what I do now.Finding new recipes to make that are appealing yet simple are a serious transition goal right now - a cook I am not!  For example:  Crushed avocado mixed and chopped hard boiled egg with lemon juice, a little hot sauce, and salt and pepper on whole wheat toast filled the bill perfectly for the traditional egg salad (with mayo) I was craving this morning.  Tasty, simple and somewhat nutritionally improved! I love vegetables and can make of meal out them with no effort.  This is the biggest plus of moving in this direction.  I even discovered a website (thank you, Michelle, of Boulderneigh Blog) called A to Z Alphabet of Vegetables - A Veggie Adventure at aveggieventure.com.  It is a grand site for vegetable identification and ideas for cooking them (like 1300+ ideas!). I was stunned that there were soooooo many vegetables. Next summer visiting farm stands will be more exciting.Backing away from most animal proteins will be easy for me.   I’ll experiment with plant based proteins. Fish and chicken will be my occasional options.  I still will have a tablespoon of evaporated milk in my coffee in the morning.  But my body won’t miss beef or pork at all. (Although full fat bacon will beckon me I am sure  😀) My favorite bread is Sour Dough - and that showed up on Mediterranean diet lists as a good choice along with high fiber choices in moderation. Healthy breads are ok for me, but  making bread the “devil\" will never fly for me.  I already use Olive Oil - with almost everything.  I love it especially with bread!  Yum.I can move away from my high sugar desserts if I substitute another sweet item when my tongue says “Don’t you want to top off that meal with a sweet thing?” - which happens all the time!  I just discovered dried figs as a substitution - knocks out that “gimmy a sweet” reaction.  Fruit sometimes does the trick but not always.  Sometimes a teaspoon of honey tricks my mouth and brain.  I need to retrain this auto reaction to top off meals with a sweet (even breakfast, haha.)I love red wine and red wine is on \"the ok list” in moderation, but most wines upset my GI system.  Vodka with diet tonic (quinine) and diet coconut water (potassium) is my cocktail of choice (in moderation as well - being the daughter of an alcoholic who is extremely careful to avoid that illness,) but vodka is not on “the ok list.”  I did find one wine that was GI acceptable from Black Box called Red Blend - yes, a box wine!  Significant changes in this area probably will not happen. And, finally, there will be no calorie or carb or fat or points counting at all.  For some reason, that counting and tracking triggers the strong desire in me to eat up to and sometimes just over my permitted levels regardless if I am hungry or not.  It focuses me too much on food, and not enough on eating just enough to avoid hunger.I really want to “eat to live” rather than “live to eat.”  In fact in my researching I found a book called Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman, MD.  Reading about things I want to do is always inspires me to stay focused.  I haven’t begun to read this book, but one statement in the 2011 summary of the book on Amazon really rang true for me.  It referred to a new added chapter in the updated printing: It explains how and why eating the wrong foods causes toxic hunger and the desire to over consume calories; whereas a diet of high micronutrient quality causes true hunger which decreases the sensations leading to food cravings and overeating behaviors.Toxic hunger!!  Now doesn’t that paint a descriptive picture.  I know that sugar causes a toxic hunger in me.  After the blood sugar ‘high' is over, the blood sugar ‘low' takes over ... and I am at the refrigerator once again looking for a snack.  Carb rich foods do the same thing.  Once I have read this book I will update it here on the blog.Anyway, I think I have a plan that just might be sustainable.  And that is the real crux of the issue, isn’t it."},
{"title": "The Diet Game", "date": "Saturday, January 9, 2021", "text": "After months of self isolation (and no real end in sight), no access to my senior gym and no logic to my food intake - I am feeling pretty sluggish!  My go-to methods to combat that feeling are not cutting it now.  I am a big fan of Weight Watchers as a healthy and successful method for losing weight BUT I am not a big fan of the tracking you needed to do for the long term.  I am not a fan of the low fat diets, low carb diets, low calorie diets or the restrictive “buy your food from us” diets either. They all require some form of tracking and tracking is what I can’t do for the rest of my life.Then, on the TV last night there was a story about the best and healthiest diets from U.S. News World Report ... you know, one of the many topics typically covered in January.  They mentioned the top 3 diets for health and weight loss.#1 Mediterranean Diet#2 DASH#3 Weight WatchersI did a little research on the internet ... and depending on the site, #2 and #3 could be exchanged for the Flexitarian Diet.  BUT, the Mediterranean diet is always part of the top 3 on all the sites I visit.Feeling like I need to take some action to combat this sluggish feeling, I am going to give the Mediterranean diet an official “try\" while I am stuck at home with time on my hands.  I have often said I could be a vegetarian if I was feeding only myself.  And the Mediterranean diet is heavy on fruits and vegetables, and low on red meats, sugar and saturated fat.  Since I am still feeding one other person - who is a meat and potato man - it will mean more food prep for me (who hates cooking, ha!)  But it seems that my body chemistry is changing anyway, and I frequently crave a lettuce salad and chicken or salmon over eating a burger or a steak.  I often prepare two different meals now because I don’t feel like eating what he is eating.  The other biggie in my mind ... besides the lack of tracking is ...  because this is an eating pattern - not a structured diet - you’re on your own to figure out how many calories you should eat to lose or maintain your weight, what you’ll do to stay active and how you’ll shape your Mediterranean menus.  Good.I really need to do more reading on how to stock my kitchen and what to make.  Anyone else on a Mediterranean-style diet and have feedback about it?  Any resources you know of to round out my knowledge of this subject?  As luck would have it I have America’s Test Kitchen, The Complete Mediterranean Cookbook already.  I’ve been attracted to this eating plan before apparently - must have bought the book!  Ha!"},
{"title": "A Sad Day We Will Get Passed!", "date": "Wednesday, January 6, 2021", "text": "Dear Blog Friends,I know that all of you share my shock at the events of this day at the Capital of the United States.  I was watching the senate proceedings on TV when I saw the live events unfold on TV before my amazed eyes.  The Trump demonstrators pushed passed the Capital guards, breaking windows, entering the Capital.  It was unbelievable to behold.  I kept hearing someone saying “oh no, oh no, oh no” not realizing it was my voice I was hearing ... until my blind husband who could not see the TV - said “tell me, tell me, ...what!”  And I had to tell him the terrible truth that my eyes were seeing.This evening I am hearing the reactions from our elected representatives and other countries - “an attack on Democracy,” “praying for the country,” “an insurrection,” “President Trump holds responsibility for this event.”  And of course, there was a death.  Reactions of disbelief.Later pictures arising on the news from within the Capital ... of the demonstrators in the senate and house chambers, in the offices, pawing through papers, posing with feet propped on desks, offices vandalized, guns raised, Trump flags waving ... So many disturbing images.  These images will be hard to forget!   To those outside the US - the unrest at present is only at the Capital.  Videos might lead one to think this violence was more wide spread.   It was only at the Capital, but this was a strike at the heart of our country.  A desecration.  A kind of terrorist attack. Abhorrent because it was orchestrated over the last 4 years by a sitting President through his words and attitudes.  A final crescendo to overturn the will of the people.  Historic. The worst possible type of historic event.  After the rioters where cleared from the Capital, the Senate and House returned to complete their work - the confirmation of the vote count for the next President of the United States. Remember - what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.                                                                                     I believe we will be stronger as a result of this event.The voice of the people has not been overturned! The man who was chosen by the people ...  Joseph Bidden ... will be our President!And prayers ... yes ... we could certainly use them."},
{"title": "Another Puzzle - Early Stages", "date": "Sunday, January 3, 2021", "text": "Felt a little lost not having a puzzle in the works this morning. So I started another one.  The next puzzle up is a little more seasonal!  This one is called - After The Snow Has Fallen from Bits and Pieces (link), artist Joseph Holodook.  It looks like fun.  This puzzle is only 500 pieces - like the first one I did - which was also from Bits and Pieces.  The initial dump of pieces is like looking at a pile of building blocks for me.  The first thing I noticed was the size of the pieces are larger!  My first impression after a month of smaller pieces is - this is a puzzle for kids!  Ha! (the box says 14+ years of age.)The photo above shows 6 pieces from two puzzles to the demonstrate the difference.  The Macabre Mansion puzzle are the brown smaller pieces.  The 6 blue pieces above are from the snow scene.  Big difference.  The snow scene has a far less detailed picture as well.  Guessing this 500 piece puzzle will be easier.First step - sorting the pieces is done.  Next step is constructing the edge pieces.  One of my regular visitors and readers, Michelle of Boulderneigh Blog (link), suggested trading puzzles with others who enjoy this pastime.  That idea has a lot merit - especially if you are not a “repeater” like me - someone who doesn’t typically get enjoyment out of doing the same puzzle again at some point. If there is any interest is something like that let me know.  It would be fun to organize a group interested in  sharing puzzles.  It would involved sending puzzles to others ... so trips to the post office, but a nice idea to work out.In my shopping around on the net, I found most puzzles fall into the $10 to $25 dollar range in cost.  A reasonable expense for a month’s worth of enjoyment.  The Macabre Mansion puzzle was expensive as puzzles go - about $35 to $40.  I enjoyed doing the Mansion puzzle - even though it was pretty hard and it took about a month to do, but I don’t think I would do it again.  I purchased the Mansion puzzle off the artist's website (HollyCarden.com).  Probably more expensive because of that and I might try to avoid stuff over $25 since it seems I will be doing more of this until we are virus free.   I hear that Costco sells jigsaw puzzles which might also be a good source to find puzzles at a discount.  And Amazon as many options.  And there are thrift stores an dollar stores and even some box stores like Walmart and Target that are options - if it is ever safe again to visit those places.  Oh well, I have about 8 puzzles in my collection now and that should keep me going for awhile.I love having a puzzle in the works.  In looking through various websites for puzzles I discovered that doing jigsaw puzzles right now is HUGELY POPULAR!  Sometimes a puzzle sells out before I even discover it.  It is just one of those things that makes passing the time at home (while socially distancing) bearable.  I can attest to the fact that it does eat up time, does fill a ’need’ that I can’t find the right word for, and it is relaxing (at least during times when I am not fretting that a pieces are 'certainly missing'.)  I’ll spare you the progress stages going forward.  It was just fun to share those observations with you."},
{"title": "Edger Alan Poe - Macabre Mansion", "date": "Saturday, January 2, 2021", "text": "This is the second puzzle I have attempted since returning to jigsaw puzzles as a past time and this one was a doozy.  Hard, hard, hard. It is called Macabre Mansion and each cut away room of the mansion represents one of the stories of Edger Alan Poe.  He wrote pretty dark stuff and that is why the house looks haunted.Box CoverI learned pretty early on that if I wanted to feel like I was making progress on this puzzle I needed to take pictures at various stages and compare.  It was too easy to imagine that a puzzle about dark stories might be “dark” itself - putting in pieces and never getting ahead.  And sometime it felt just like that.November 29, 2020I couldn’t help the feeling that I might have bit off more than I could chew with this puzzle.After all, the first puzzle was only 500 pieces and it moved along consistently.  This puzzle I took many breaks from.  I would get 4 or 5 puzzle pieces in and then it would just dry up.  Nothing.  I would take a break and come back 5 or 6 hours later - and put another 2 or 3 pieces in - and again, it would dry up.And so it went for days.December 8, 2020It was between December 8 and the 25th that I inspired myself to keep moving forward by playing a little mind game.  With each piece that I put in I reminded myself I didn’t need to sort through THAT piece again if it made it onto the puzzle board.December 25, 2020At Christmas I could really tell a difference.  Christmas, being what it was this year (quiet with no demands) I pushed forward wanting to finished before 2021.December 30, 2020I could see progress if I looked at the board, but finding the correct pieces didn’t get all that much easier.  I decided that the pictures were small and the pieces were small and the visual clues of the surrounding pictures didn’t seem to help all that much finding the missing piece.January 1, 2021Ok, so I didn’t complete it by the end of 2020!  But it is complete.I can’t tell you how many times I decided that a piece was missing.  That I looked through all the remaining pieces and could not find the one I was looking for.  I would have bet moneypieces were missing.  Nothing was missing.  Glad I didn’t express that thought out loud.In the last week of completion I found myself running my hands over the finished areasenjoying the feeling of being so close to done.A few close ups to show the complexity of the images.  DONE!!It stayed like that overnight and I enjoyed looking at it again over coffee this morning.Now it is broken apart and into its box.  I did hold out the edge pieces and put them in a separate baggie just in case I repeat this puzzle again.It is hard to know if I will repeat making any of the puzzles I have.  I don’t re-read books, or duplicated knitted items.  I am not much of a repeater.  But you never know."},
{"title": "Making Space #3", "date": "Wednesday, December 23, 2020", "text": "I am joining Beckie at http://www.Fieldlilies.blogspot.com) on an informal challenge called Making Space. My ability to stick to any kind of schedule is near impossible so I have decide to forgo the idea of a regular schedule.  Don't know if it is stubbornness on my part or just a growing lack of discipline, but there you have it!  Despite few regular posts in Making Space, I am still working towards decluttering.  I just haven't shared my progress.  Of course, part of this event is blog sharing - so here goes.A picture, 2 cook books, a cat and dog hair shaver, a set of 9 miniature metal vehicles, a canvas bag, a candle, a plastic Chinese carry out container (heading for the trash like it should have months ago).A free standing floor fan by Casablanca that is beautiful but doesn't work any more and the cost to fix it was ridiculous ... and most importantly it was a very heavy fan and hard to lift ... so it is history.   And a whistling tea kettle that has never whistled!  Not from day one!  And 4 days ago, I tried to use it for a cup of hot tea and promptly forgot it!  By the time I returned to the kitchen the water was all gone.  There was no damage to the stove or the kettle, but as a future safety measure this tea kettle had to go.  I love the look of it on my stove, but forgetting things seems to be a risk at 73 that I need to compensate for.  So I purchased a replacement.My new tea kettle!Whistles like a dream.  It took a bit of effort to find this replacement - the one I ordered from Amazon came broken.  I wasn't willing to try for a second delivery with the Christmas delivery rush now upon us and delays rampant.  So I went into a brick and mortar store to buy one - got in and out fast!   The choices were surprisingly slim.  Black was not my first choice, but it looks fine with my black appliances - and it whistles!!   Fire hazards I don't need.   Now I won't burn down my condo - or other condos - at least not with a tea kettle!That makes 18 items this time around that have gone on to 'other lives' with someone else (or were laid to rest in the trash), and with this post a grand total of 39 in 3 posts.  Funny little mind game in the challenge:  Knowing the grand total of items decluttered since I started this challenge has resulted in an unanticipated positive realization.  Although I am not moving car-loads of items out the door almost everyday like I did in my major downsizing effort to move to this condo, the grand total reminds me each time of the full scope of items that no longer are in my way - items I no longer have to live around!  A good feeling each time that number grows."},
{"title": "The Look of a Pandemic Christmas", "date": "Wednesday, December 16, 2020", "text": "We are all facing some version of a Pandemic Christmas!  I thought I would share how mine looks this year.As many of you know Christmas traditionally has been a hard time for me.  Some big and sad events have negatively colored my of enjoyment of Christmas.  Those sad memories center around losing my dad decades ago 3 days before Christmas and my mom in 2014 ... 3 days after Christmas.  And then there were the Christmases that my mom could not make it to our home - which had been her home for 5 years - forced by the circumstances of dementia - to stay in Assisted Living and finally in a nursing home during this festive time.  And let's not forget the military service families - my son spent time in the military and missed several Christmases with us.  That 'joy vs sadness scale' I struggle with every year always seems to tilt toward sadness.  While there are those who can set those memories aside - like putting them into a box and sticking them in a closet, I cannot. It is part of my life experience.  Yeah ... the holiday is short on cheer for me.  Most years I would have just skipped the season if I could.  But family traditions pulled me forward even when I didn't want to go.This year, however, was going to be special.  My grand daughter is 2 3/4 years old  (3 in February) and is now learning about Christmas in a way that will set the stage for many happy years to come!  She wrote her first letter (with her mom's help) to Santa and she decorated her own felt tree with felt ornaments.  Her letter was totally charming - asking for \"a toy\" for her and some treats for her dogs.  I knew that the joy of experiencing this Christmas would add some pluses in the joy side of the scale putting some balance back into this holiday for me.Except - now we have this pandemic I won't be seeing my son, daughter-in-law or grand daughter this year.  I kind of expected that might be the case - with the virus surging.  So I prepared myself emotionally for that possibility.   Ok,  I told myself. I can do this Pandemic Christmas.   I shopped on line for Christmas - no different from other years, so the Pandemic didn't change anything for me in that regard.  Ok, I told myself - no big change here.  I usually have stockings filled with incidentals but not this year.  I shopped for those in person at a brick and mortar store ... but not this year, no stores, unless it is the grocery store.  Ok, I can let go of that kind of fluff.   No Christmas sleep over with 3 dogs and one cat squeezed into a 2 bedroom condo with 5 people. Ok. I prepared for that as well - family gatherings being discourage while we are in the peak of this pesky pandemic.  My daughter and her dog, Milo, will be here (hopefully) and a scaled down celebration is appropriate.My Christmas decorations are not out yet - decorations that are mostly just a Christmas tree.  We are waiting for a delivery date on our new windows and the installers need space to work.  Having the tree up - against the living room windows where I like it - would be a problem.  I'll give them until a few days before Christmas.  Then - that tree is going up, and they can schedule us in January.  Burr - I wanted to avoid January for changing out the windows. *sigh*Gifts are wrapped like normal, but without bows.  I would have needed to go to a store for ribbon and it just wasn't a good enough reason to risk catching anything.  Besides ... the gifts will need to be transport to another house before Christmas and they will travel best without big puffy bows.  No biggie.I was doing very well with the needed limitations for Pandemic Christmas this year, until ...As I wrapped my grand daughter's gifts I could feel my eyes filling with tears!  Crap!! Her first real Christmas - the one where she discovered what Santa brought, the one where she experienced the excitement and joy of Christmas morning.  I wouldn't get to see that. I reached for tissues.  I was caught off guard by these thoughts.  I kept wrapping, faster now, because I needed to get past this.Of course, the discovery that I really wasn't ok with all these changes could not be ignored.As I moved on to wrapping gifts for others I got control of my emotions and scolded myself for such selfish self pity.  There are people who are missing family members for all Christmases into the future.  People struggling with the sadness of being separated from loved one in the hospital or nursing home ... loved ones struggling to breathe, maybe dying alone, and not even being able to be at their side to hold a hand.  And as I thought about those things I replaced my sorrow with anger!  Some Americans have made this pandemic more serious than it needed to be because of their self-important opinion that masks and social distancing aren't necessary.  That no matter the number of deaths (in the US as of this writing - 300,000+ deaths), and no matter the number of pleas seen on TV and on social media from weary, overworked and emotionally exhausted doctors and hospital staff, their personal opinion and desires \"trumped\" every other consideration [quoted word used intentionally.]I am pretty sure the replacement of sorrow with anger is not an improvement!  I certainly don't want to add anger to the catalogue of emotions I experience at Christmas time.And then I saw on TV the first people - healthcare folks - get the new vaccine for Covid-19!  I felt my eyes tearing up again.  Not in sorrow or anger, but joy!! We finally have something to be joyful about.  A first 'punch' back by the human race to fight against a virus that had taken so much from all of us.  My mind drifted then to all the truly unsung heroes -  researchers - scientific heroes who are faceless and seldom heard from, but sacrificed so much for 9 months to get to this point.  And the manufacturing entities and transportation teams that moved this virus from the laboratory to the patient with wartime speed and coordination.  And finally to all the doctors and nurses, who worked diligently under massive stress and sometimes massive sorrow - breaking at times to step outside and cry - but always returning again and again to their jobs!  Ok, so now I am not angry anymore.  We all have a gift to be grateful for - every single human on this earth - and it came at the gift giving time when many of us honor the birth of Christ (Coincidental? I don't think so.)  It didn't come with any wrapping paper or bows, but I think we all got what we needed this holiday season - hope and a one-two punch against Covid-19. And just for the record ... this is a \"Gorilla Size\" joy -  may just have moved that lopsided 'joy vs sadness scale' in the right direction. I will have a husband and maybe a daughter with me this Christmas. I still have that amazing grand daughter ...  and she is the light of my life - whether beside me or not.  I still have all my family members even if we are not all together.  I am blessed beyond words to live in a time when science can be heroic!"},
{"title": "A Promised Land by Barack Obama", "date": "Sunday, December 13, 2020", "text": "If you are a Trump supporter, out of respect to your feelings, you might want to take a pass on this post.  I am a very regular reader / listener of books.  But I rarely review them for my blog.  I enjoy reading the reviews of books in other blogs ... it is just not my thing to do.  Another thing I try to avoid on my blog is political lecturing.  This post is not really a review of a book, but it will have my political views rant.  In truth, it is an emotional release after 4 long painful years of frustration watching our government step away from our place in the world and from its responsibilities even to its own citizens.A Promised Land by Barack ObamaI should also probably admit, I am a huge fan of President Obama and his lovely family.  I was a \"non-political\" citizen for most of my life (except the last 4 years) - always voting, of course, but always putting more emphasis on leadership potential and personal values expressed instead of policy,  position and party.  I always supported whoever won the election regardless, because that is what the electorate decided. The will of the people is .... well, the will of the people!!   And everyone gets behind the winner for the good of the country.  For the most part all candidates in my memory had the best interests of the country in their hearts - they just saw the path to doing \"the right thing\" differently.  But these last 4 years have been an eye opener.  I have been sick to the bottom of my soul by the self-centered, selfish, uneducated, and unqualified man who followed President Obama into that prestigious office.  This mistake-of-a-man, who even in his defeat tries to overturn the vote (and thereby the will) of the people by saying the vote was tainted, - despite all the lawsuits that have been knocked down, the Supreme Court refusing to hear the case brought by Texas, all the vote recounts and the assessment by his own Justice Department that there was no fraud in this election - this ridiculous man continues to cry \"fowl!\"  To this day - I don't understand the support he receives.With that said I will also admit that I have a rather naive, \"rose-colored glasses\" opinion of our country.  It IS the greatest country on earth with the patchwork of it citizens coming from all over the globe, its experiment in democracy that is still a work in progress, and its desire to do \"right\" for all people because - all men are created equal.  Has this country lived up to all those wonderful \"pie in the sky\" words lately?  Nope ... but I do believe that despite occasional wrong turns, this country does right itself and moves forward with the desire to live up to those words.  That is what is happening today in my country.  We are correcting from a devastatingly wrong turn and attempting to right ourselves.So where does the book A Promised Land fit into this post?  President Obama's book expresses exactly my same positive assumptions of America!  Word for word - he makes the point that we will prevail and the will of the people will succeed in the end.  This book is giving me such hope that my personal (and admittedly bias) perspective of my country is indeed the correct one.President Obama's book focuses on how he was raised and how he got into public service and eventually politics and follows him through the first term as President.  He was not a career politician like so many think.  In fact, it can almost be said that with minimal experience in national politics -  he was the right person, to come along at the right time, to lift the nation emotionally and pull us from the brink of financial collapse!  The right person at the right time!  That is what he was, and that is how history will see him.  I won't live long enough to read that history, but there is no doubt.  Just like Lincoln and Roosevelt and Kennedy and several others ... their place in history was cemented by challenges they faced and overcame - so it will be with President Barack Obama.Now you might think I felt the country was perfect under President Obama.  You would be wrong.  No President is perfect just as no political party is perfect.  But the atmosphere was more civil then. Less hateful and polarized.  Families didn't need to make rules about \"No political discussions at the dinner table.\"  Friends could agree or disagree about current events without losing the relationship.  There was clear sense of fact vs fiction.  A desire to see each person as a fellow citizen and not an enemy.  Plainly stated - it was just a more normal time.   I believe that kind of \"normal\" starts at the top - with the leadership of the country.  At the top what we had was just not normal.Listening to President Obama read his own story is very enjoyable.  Not all authors are good at narration.  But President Obama is an excellent and educated orator, and hearing that wonderfully educated voice once again felt very good.  The comparison to the last 4 years is hard to ignore.    Facebook circulated a post that said:  If a young person questions the value of education - have them listen to the speeches of Obama and Trump side by side.  There can be no question of the value of education.Do I recommend this book?  I most certainly do.  No matter your political persuasion ... it is helpful to recall what public service really looks and sounds like.  It is not about the stock market or about \"America First\" to the exclusion of all other peoples on the face of the earth.  It is not about allowing the rich to get richer with the help of government to the exclusion of all other people struggling just to get by.  It is not about ignoring science and wishing away a pandemic and virus that kills - and constantly saying we are \"turning a corner\" when the science and data say differently.  It is not about treating our allies badly while catering to dictators and thugs.  Its not about dividing our citizens against each other and participating in name calling on a Twitter account, and lying so often that it is beyond anyone's ability to keep count.  And don't get me started on his much denied White Supremacy position ... because that is exactly who has been sitting in the Oval Office for 4 years!!Read this book to remind yourself of what public service and \"the common good\" looks like!  Read it to remember where we were, understand how far we have fallen, and where we need to claw ourselves back to once again."},

{"title": "Pandemic Winter Plan!", "date": "Saturday, December 5, 2020", "text": "Winter 2020-2021 will be a \"stay at home\" winter.  Past winters were filled with regularly scheduled out-of-the-house activities - visiting my son's dogs done while everyone at work, visiting my grand daughter's daycare, trips into DC to get my daughter's dog, visit with groups of friends, shopping at 'brick and mortar stores' as needs demanded and so on and so on.  Most of that has dropped away or performed in a socially distant manner.What is left after pandemic restrictions is grocery shopping (done quickly), pharmacy runs (drive up window) and doctor appointments done by Zoom or with excessive cautions.  Everything else, when it can be arranged, is at a distance.  The result is considerably more at home \"me time.\"\"Me time\" can default to \"doing nothing time\" if I am not careful.  Because I know me so well 😃, I decided to create my \"stay at home\" plan for Pandemic Winter 2020-2021. Beyond casual pursuits like puzzles, reading, lego kits, and the like ...  (none of which is productive but fun all the same ...), and beyond house cleaning, I identified a few projects and some other non-fun items that have been bouncing around in my brain.   I would like to stop the bouncing - and do them!   Although this list looks suspiciously like a New Year's Resolution list - it isn't!  Resolutions are the \"kiss of death\" for me. If I want to fail at something, I label it a \"resolution.\"  But I am very much a 'list person.'  If it is on a list - even if I put it off for a long time - I know it won't escape my attention forever!   To add just a little bit of pressure to this list, I have established a time frame:  December 1 to March 31.   Four months!I can't resist lists and bullets.  Ha!  And as with all lists, my desires are probably bigger than my abilities and time, but no matter.  Here goes!!Knitting and Crochet ProjectsEsk's blanket - started and needs finishing.  I am moving along smartly on this blanket.  It is easy knitting and great for watching TV or talking with others on Zoom.  And it helps that I like this pattern AND I am using deep deep stash of more than probably 7 or 8 years old!  Win-win!My scarf - started and needs finishing.  This yarn is called Sea Pearl by Briar Rose Fibers - 50% merino wool and 50% tencel - so it has a nice shine - better than the picture shows. The color is more gorgeous as well It is fingering weight.  And Briar Rose is one of those online venders that I love.  Her skeins are always a generous size. This is 800 yards.My sweater - need to start and finish. Oh my! The saga of this yarn!  To begin with - it was expensive and I bought a bunch from Purl SoHo about 3 or 4 years ago for another pattern.  The original pattern was all cables. I decided I didn't like the first pattern after all, and I worked my way through selecting 3 other choices which were all vetoed before casting on. I have finally (hopefully) settled on THE pattern (in the second picture.)  This yarn is Cashmere and extra fine merino wool.  The color is more like the second picture. The first picture shows a lovely color which is totally false.  But the yarn does change depending on the light.  The color is called Tidepool -  designed to remind you of water - sometimes blue, sometimes gray, sometimes greenish.   Queen's Crochet Blanket - start this winter and finish whenever ... Yep! This is the infamous 6,000+ yards of sport weight yarn I recently purchased for the Queen's crochet blanket pattern I blogged about in a previous post.  Color-way: Ruby. It is slightly compressed in this picture by the net packaging it came in, and I think I will leave it that way until I am ready to start.  It looks like less yardage than it is - so I feel a little less guilty.Jacket sweater for Esk - need to start and complete for winter 2021-2022. I did no kid knitting in 2020. I am still working out which pattern and yarn I will use, but \"ALL will be from stash!\" announced by my Better Self - you remember her from a previous post.  The \"self\" I almost killed when I became possessed with the Queen's Blanket. Weave a shawl off the loom - started last year and here it sits taking up space - but will finish this winter. I am not really much of a loom weaver, but I totally resist giving away my Rigid Heddles - because I am totally tickled and may fall back in love with it at a later date.Although I have done some loom weaving, what really calls to me is Tapestry Weaving.  I have two looms for this type of weaving and the reference materials and the yarn - just never the time.  Guess this is the time!! I started a sampler on the loom below.  Need to finish that project and then dig into my new Tapestry book in the last picture.Don't buy anymore yarn!  (My 'better self' insisted I add this bullet!)Condo ProjectsInstall new windows - We purchased new windows in October for our condo.  Our current windows are builder grade, which translates to cheap, leaky and hard to open and close. so a necessary expense that is scheduled for this winter.Clean out all heat/air conditioning and dryer vents - After 18 years I doubt that this has been done.  This is scheduled for this month.  Putty up and patch paint holes in walls from drapes and hardware that has been removed and thrown away.  I am not a curtains person.  The drapes belonged to the previous owner.  Even though the windows look kind of bare right now, I was glad to see them gone.  Once the new windows are in - come spring we will get better window treatments.Clean out the pantry - and My.Dear.God - that little big to-do has been on my list for almost a year - this is part of my decluttering effort which will also continue.Self Improvement (what kind of a list would this be without some improvements here.)Return to my leg exercise program, so I stop walking like my mother in her late 80s.  Get my step count back up to 10,000 steps a day - so my energy levels improve.  While this list seems exhaustively long to me, I have never had so much open time on my hands as I will this winter, (thank you Covid 19, I guess) so it is hard to judge how much I can get done.  But having it all on a list - posted on my fridge - will be very helpful with keeping me focused. So that is my 2020-2021 Pandemic Winter Plan! I feel more mentally in control having a plan for this pandemic winter. It makes the indoor time seem less constricting and more productive - almost like it is my choice as opposed to dictated by conditions!What is your plan?Do you even need one?Hope we all make it out the other side of this winter ...healthy and sane!😀"},

After all it is a world wide event.  Just make the best of it my \"better self\" advised.After a few weeks of making 'the best of it,' I decided to find the silver lining the cloud that is pandemic isolation.  It was the perfect time, after all, to focus on and reduce my current large yarn stash rather than finding ways to add to it.  Knit and crochet more, give away more and stop buying more!  (I would like to see a show of hands of those who listen to their \"better selves.\")   In April I thinned out stash resulting in several grocery bags full of yarn delivered to a local thrift shop! Excellent.  I began and finished a simple garter stitch blanket of doubled Caron Simply Soft acrylic - of which I have gobs!  But I couldn't rid myself of the idea that \"pandemic feelings\"  had been knitted into that item.  It's going to the thrift shop.  I dug deep in my stash again to finish a scarf in silk sport weight yarn for my daughter.  The scarf is with my daughter now and the left over yarn is going to the thrift bag.  I started a second blanket using more Caron Simply Soft in a simple yet interesting design.  I like it better.  And I don't have any bad feelings being knit into it.  The skein shown will also be included in the stripe pattern.Yes, all signs say I am going in the right direction.Then the dam burst - well ... not a sudden explosion, but more of a trickle that grew into a flood and then an explosion!  In early May Maryland Sheep and Wool went Virtual on the web.  I told my \"better self\" I should support the small business yarn vendors who were taking a HUGE hit from cancelled fairs.  I shopped!  I purchased enough yarn from Briar Rose Yarns to knit 2 good size afghans in chunky wool and 4 chunky wool cowls.    Having done my patriotic duty I put the breaks on once again.  (Notice how I slipped in words like \"patriotic duty\" to characterize an increase in my stash.)This summer the Michigan Sheep and Wool festival went Virtual.  I got an email announcement from Briar Rose Yarns that she was participating and offering a discount.  Patriotism isn't a one time event, right?  In deep diving into my yarn stash in April, I found a shawl pattern and yarn I purchased years ago from Briar Rose and I wanted to start that project.  But I discovered the pattern required 2 skeins of Briar Rose yarn and I had purchased only 1 at the time.  Feeling moved to do my patriotic part I \"attended\" the Michigan event and got my two skeins. But I felt the slippage.  Corrective action was needed.  The brakes were on.  Don't open any emails that boasted of fiber festivals.  Done!!  Don't open any emails from yarn vendors.  Done!!  Temptation controlled.  I was feeling pretty noble. Then I came across a random blog post (not one of my regular blog friends) where the writer had just finished The Queen's Blanket CAL (Crochet A-Long.)  (I should have backed away from the computer immediately.  I didn't). At first I thought I was looking at weaving, and then I discovered it was 'mosaic crochet stitch' design.  Seriously, it was stunning!  I visited the instruction video by the blanket's designer on how to do mosaic crochet - and I was hooked ( ... sorry!).  You need only 3 stitches to do this blanket: chain stitch, single crochet, double crochet! (I could feel the water beginning to trickle over the top of the dam!)I could DO THIS!The pattern on Ravelry came in two sizes: small and large.  The CAL was over, but the pattern was available for purchase AND the instruction videos that accompanied the CAL were also available. I purchased the pattern.  Surely I must already have the yarn I need for this in my stash!  I checked!  Nope.  Sport or DK weight was suggested (and a lot of it) and multiple complimentary colors were needed.   (You would have stopped at this point, right?  I didn't.)I checked on line again. The CAL had been supported by pre-made kits in 3 color ways in each of the two sizes.  A long list of shops carried the yarn - but at first glance they were all in the UK.               (\"Seriously, stop now.\" the voices in my head said as the flood waters began to race past.)  I tried to order a large kit (yes, large, what the heck) from a UK shop and during the online purchase I kept getting blocked.  (A 'sign' from my better self that said don't do this.) I emailed the shop to find out why they blocked me from ordering.  The shop quickly responded saying \"due to shipping problems and the expense, they were not shipping International orders of the large kit.  So sorry.\"  Well, darn!  Darn was not the word I used, but you get the picture.   (I am the Sign of The Ram - Aries, and once in motion, the Ram never stops.  I made myself busy by \"planting\" dynamite under my dam.)   Then I googled the yarn limiting my search to only a US supplier - and I found LoveCrafts - a UK company with a US presence.  They had the kits.  YES!! It was not an International order.  I purchased that yarn - ALL 6,000+ YARDS OF IT!! (BOOM!! No more pesky dam! And I jumped up and down a few times on my \"better self\" just for good measure.)Excitedly I \"tracked\" the package as it made its way to me through the postal system - except it didn't make its way to me at all.  You see the address I provided had a 20175 zipcode which is in Virginia.   My zip code is 21075 which is in Maryland.  So there it sat in Virginia much to my frustration for whole 3 days - not moving an inch.  I called the Virginia post office.  Yes ... they had had the package but it was on it way back to the sender as \"Undeliverable.\"  (By now I was pretty sure I was being punished by my \"better self\" for purchasing another 6,000+ yards of yarn!)I called LoveCrafts and explained the situation.  THEY WERE WONDERFUL!  The customer service rep confirmed with the Virginia post office that the first package was on its way back to them - and LoveCrafts immediately sent out another kit to me at the right zip code!  They were so wonderful that I wanted to go right out to them AGAIN and order more yarn!(Oh wait ... )So I am rebuilding my \"dam\" and resurrecting my \"better self\" so I can survive this pandemic isolation.Who knew pandemics had so many hidden dangers beyond getting a very contagious, life-threatening virus!  I sure hope this pandemic is over soon.  Very very soon!"},
{"title": "A \"Tool Lover\" Shares", "date": "Sunday, November 29, 2020", "text": "I have a lot of hobbies.  Knitter, sometimes weaver, crocheter, lego builder, Kindle reader, Audible reader and as of lately, jigsaw puzzler.  Hobby people know that the tools of a hobby often are as important as the action itself. I say all this to help introduce you to a new tool of mine.And here it is - my new puzzle board!!I know.  I know.  I can hear your thoughts.  My . God . That . Thing . Looks . Big!!I said the same thing when I saw the size of the box it came in and realized.... ITS BIG!!As you would expect, there is a story that goes with this new addition -  that stunned me at first, but won me over when I began to use it.I previously blogged about the simple cloth puzzle saver roll.  Initially it worked pretty good - meaning the puzzle pieces stayed relatively in place and none were lost in this rolled state.But as I began to complete more and more of the puzzle, there were problems.  More and more pieces to stabilize. Less and less stability as it grew in size.Until finally I had 2/3s of the puzzle completed and it looked quite messy when I opened it up each time.Many of the pieces had moved and a lot were ajar when I carefully unrolled the puzzle.  I would spend about 20 minutes getting everything back into place before doing what I really wanted to do ... adding new pieces.  Unsatisfactory.  It made me unhappy every time - and once or twice I chose not to work on the puzzle because I didn't want to spend time repairing my work.  Obviously if I had a dedicated space where I could leave the puzzle out - no special board would be needed.  Now in this condo I don't have the floor space to set up a separate table somewhere and we use the kitchen table every single day so that could not be a permanent space either.  I needed another option.  I shopped around and fell in love with this tilt board option.  The transfer of the puzzle from the cloth to the board was time consuming.  This puzzle interlocks but not as firmly as some I have done.  Pieces came apart as I tried to lift them connected onto the board.  But finally it was transferred. I could tell as I did this part, the board assisted me with keeping pieces attached to the felting.  Nice!This board was definitely not a cheap option, but it is a HUGE improvement in working on the puzzle!  Besides the fact it can hold larger puzzles up to 1500 pieces (this puzzle is 500 pieces), the surface felting grips the pieces in place even at an extreme tilt.  I love that it is made of beautiful New Zealand Pine wood - beautifully made.  In addition it has a wood cover - felt on the puzzle side - that fits over the puzzle and locks in place.The board then folds down and locks together.  It has a handle that makes carrying it easy.And it can then be stored away for another time - not taking up any table space.Other than its size - which still seems large to me - it is perfect!Working on the puzzle is so much easier now than before.  It has several adjustable tilt angles and can swivel on its stand.  The swivel feature is not so important now - but who knows in the future.  NOW THE BIG QUESTION WAS ... what will the puzzle look like when I open it up again!  So here it is the next morning - set up for puzzling.No pieces are unlocked. No adjustment necessary.  Just as I left it - except that it might have slipped down the felting just a bit - but it did so as a solid piece.  Excellent!!The puzzle was completed on Thanksgiving before dinner.I made this picture big - so you can see what I didn't see.  At first I thought the puzzle had come with an extra piece!  THAT never happens.  A missing piece, maybe.  I showed it to my daughter, she was surprise as well.  So after I took the picture above, I threw the extra piece away.  I then returned to the puzzle to dismantle it - and discovered the open space.  Do you see it?  It is pretty obvious now looking at the full puzzle. Haha.  So I dug out the missing piece from the trash!  So Here is the puzzle completely finished on my BIG puzzle board.And BIG is good, right?  I have heard size matters, right?  🤣"},
{"title": "Thankful!", "date": "Friday, November 27, 2020", "text": "Here I sit typing away at my computer at 5:30 am the day after Thanksgiving!  It is peaceful and comforting to have this very quiet time today.  No \"Black Friday\" hub-bub for me.  Just the gentle beginning of a day filled with ... nothing. I love days filled with nothing!  They are so few and far between.Our Thanksgiving yesterday was small. The food was traditional and functional if not entirely mouthwatering (remember: not the cook sitting here.) But it was a good Thanksgiving for many reasons.  Our daughter was with us - as she is most weekends and Milo, her dog.  We spent the morning finishing up a Halloween puzzle with a brand new tool that made the puzzling so much better (that post is scheduled for publishing on Sunday.) We watched the Thanksgiving Day parade from New York (fun but different with no on-sight attendees) and followed that up with the Dog Show - always great fun.  There was no audience there either - just cardboard cut outs of people and dogs in the stands.  As odd as it was to see no one at these two events - it was wonderful to see that precautions like this are being taken seriously. And we visited by Google Video and Zoom with family during the day.  Yes, that was a Thanksgiving to be grateful for in many ways.While many were technically missing from our dinner table - no one was permanently missing as some families experienced this year!  So for that I am forever grateful.  The first holidays after someone has died are always so terribly hard.  Many lost family members this year due to Covid. Finally, what I am most grateful for is the fact that I have adapted to this new way of living without too much feeling of loss.  I know that many are still struggling with this, because you see and hear about it on the TV - big group events where no masks can be seen, people \"taking a break\" from the pandemic protocols - \"just this once.\"  And later hearing the stories of how they contracted Covid with just one lapse in judgement!  It is hard.  Just plain hard for some to change the way they live for this long a time.  But I am grateful beyond measure that for whatever reason - I am content to ride this pandemic out safely - with minimal sacrifice - and hopefully come out on the other end well. Truly a reason to be grateful.A belated Thanksgiving wish to you.Stay healthy and happy with the season - just as it looks now!Be thankful!"},
{"title": "Making Space #2", "date": "Wednesday, November 25, 2020", "text": "For some reason I am unable to confine myself to any kind of structure, rules or regulations.  It is a pattern that seems to be developing the older I get.  At 73 I am become more emboldened to miss deadlines and resist expectations ... finding them to be uncomfortable like wearing tummy slimming panty hose over a tummy that refuses to be slimmed.   No, I am not at the \"breaking the law\" stage or anything ... at least not yet!  🤣 Joking of course.  Truth: I am not breaking the law, and Truth: I wouldn't admit it here if I did, and Truth: I might want to try that sometime - you know, like jay-walking or something. Ha!  But Final Truth: I am not going to do something really stupid.  I am not totally insane ... at least not yet! 🤣 !   Anyway, back on topic - if there is a deadline I am definitely going to miss it - even if I made the deadline myself!  And that is what I am doing weekly with my Making Space posts. Missing the deadline. Going forward - I am participating but the posts will just be ... well ... a surprise!    You see I had these decluttering items ready for a post for the last 2 weeks.  They sat in a bag near my table - technically still in my house but waiting for the \"decluttering ax\" to fall right after I posted about them.  There are 11 items here mostly going into the trash but the children's cloth books will go to the thrift store along with the shorts that don't fit (for the same reason I don't wear tummy slimming panty hose) and a tee shirt that shrunk upon washing or my breasts grew or I gained weight.  (I like option #1.)With this post 21 items total have been discarded."},
{"title": "Addiction In A Box", "date": "Friday, November 13, 2020", "text": "So now I remember ... Addiction.Almost a full day spent getting this puzzle sorted and prepared for when my daughter arrives to night ... so we can work on it together.  I thought I would start to get the borders in place to save time.  And sorting out some pieces into separate categories so they are easier to sort through.  And then just going a little further with some inside pieces because I couldn't find all the border pieces.  And when I looked up ... it was 3:30 in the afternoon.  I did nothing but work on this puzzle today.  Geez!!  I should back up.  The past spring I got it in my head that I wanted to do some jigsaw puzzles.   You know, 'pandemic boredom' had set it.  So I started shopping on line and discovered this was not a new idea.  Apparently the rest of the world had the same idea.  The puzzles I was interested in were selling out at record speed.  I finally settled on 5 puzzles - 1000 pieces each.  Then I paused.  It has been probably  25 years since I did jigsaw puzzles.  So I purchase another one - 500 pieces to get into the swing of this with a smaller challenge.AND because I don't have a dedicated space to leave a puzzle set up, I shopped around for puzzle savers.  I used to have a HUGE one that did not work very well.  You would close it up like a very large brief case.  When it was re-opened, everything was a mess.  I settled on an inflated roll and cover.That all happened in the spring and summer.  I had not opened even one of them.  Life got busy and 'pandemic boredom' passed.  Then last weekend my daughter expressed an interest in doing a puzzle and I was thrilled.  But my procastinor self waiting until today - Friday.  By default - today is the day.That's the back story. The front story is I spent the whole day working on it - couldn't set it down - although I tried twice and found myself returning again and again.  Here is, 'little old anal me,' setting up the puzzle on my new felt pad.  Along with the puzzle saver roll. I purchased puzzle trays that allow you to sort your pieces by whatever method you choose and keep them neat and tidy between puzzle sessions.  This puzzle was 500 pieces and didn't look too hard.  In the end had an edge piece tray, an object piece tray (if I could make out the object on the piece it when into a tray), a letters piece tray, a blue piece tray, and a checker board floor piece tray.  All the other pieces were left together for now.At 3:30 after sorting out the trays and trying to complete the border (which I haven't - I also remember swearing that pieces were missing years ago - they never were - but I am sure this time!! 😀) this is what got done. This is the only thing that got done today.Holy Moly!!  Does anyone else work on puzzles?  Do you have a method or are you just not as OCD as I am?  Is this progress typical?  Its been 25 years or more and I just don't remember, but I can tell you if you are trying to juggle a job and a family and house hold chores ... DO NOT TAKE UP JIGSAW PUZZLES!!  Of course if you are like me and your time is your own - give them a try.  They are great fun.  I just wish I could leave the puzzle out and put in a few pieces at time and then walk away.  I wonder if they have Jigsaw Puzzle Anonymous groups!Anyway, I finally packed it up so we could eat at the table and here is how it looks.And here are the other puzzles waiting in the wings to totally destroy any plans I have for things like laundry, cooking, food shopping, cleaning.  Oh wait!  I hate doing those things.  Ha!  So maybe this isn't a bad thing!And, yes, I show 6 puzzles!  Forgot a few.  And they have a similar theme - Halloween-ie!  Guess I need to broaden by collection."},
{"title": "Memories of Halloween", "date": "Tuesday, November 10, 2020", "text": "Halloween 2020 was bound to be different from any previous Halloween of my memory.  It was my grand daughter's first Halloween - or rather the first one she would be able to participate in. Her parents planned a party at home for her - a small family gathering, just me and her grandfather and her Aunt.  We came done up in witch hats and blinking light necklaces and wrapped Halloween cookies for her treat bag.My two beautiful ladies - Esk and my daughter!Her mom made the cutest Halloween cake - from scratch, no less.  Cute as could be and very delicious. (Low in calories, too.  Not!)Her parents had a Halloween blow up figure in the back yard, a scavenger hunt in the house for Halloween goodies and a yummy dinner of barbecue ribs. She was dressed as a ballerina! Even her dog Rags had a costume - devil wings - that he wore for only about 2 minutes because he was sort of terrorized by them and we couldn't leave them on when we saw his reaction.  Poor boy.  For such a big imposing bully (English Bulldog), he is secretly not imposing at all.I love this picture of my son and his daughter. He is such a good guy and it warms my heart totally to see him gently nurturing such a beautiful child.  And Halloween just wouldn't be Halloween unless you visited a neighbor and greeted them with a \"Trick or Treat.\"  Their few neighbors live on 6 or more acre plots - just visible from their own property and trick or treating was a rare occurrence. No other children live on that lane.  Esk came with a small bag of treats for the neighbors!!But one neighbor - an elderly couple who seem to have struck up a neighborly relationship with the younger new comers on the lane (my son and his wife) invited this little person, my dear Esk,  to make a trick or treat visit to them.  So we all walked down the lane in the late afternoon to visit and get a piece of candy.   So much fun.  More fun than canvasing a townhouse development or apartment project where the neighbors are on top of each other and the candy haul would become too heavy for those little arms to carry.  The candy dish was on the bottom step.And how much fun it was to see the neighbors encourage Esk to take more candy (in fact take the whole bowl - of about 20 pieces) while she had mother's words of repeating in her head, \"Esk, when you visit you take just one piece.\"  You can be sure Esk walked away with all the pieces!And the adults got to visit for a short time while Esk picked candy one piece at a time.  It was so much fun.Esk was not frightened at all by the images moving on her walls.  She loves the Halloween cartoons and stories so much.  Some day things might go back to normal, but for now, making new memories (safe and socially distant memories) is what it is all about.Her Trick or Treat bag!"},
{"title": "Making Space #1", "date": "Monday, November 9, 2020", "text": "So yeah!  I missed the first week of decluttering!  Thank goodness this is a relaxed kind of challenge!  Sigh!I am joining Beckie at http://www.Fieldlilies.blogspot.com) on an informal challenge called Making Space - Declutter 10 items a week - and if life gets in the way - you might miss a week, but the goal is to post 10 items weekly on the day of your choosing.It wasn't hard getting 10 items together this first week.  These items are things I have kept for absolutely no good reason.  Three magazines all from 2018 - that have been sitting on my end table in the living room.  It is 2020 last I checked! Never opened!  I should never buy magazines.  I never read them.  A bag of red mechanical pencil refills.  I don't even own a mechanical pencil and I never write in red. I have no memory of when those refills came into our house.  Two mayonnaise jars I saved for some really.good.reason!!! (Not!) Do you save jars?  Am I the only crazy person that saves that kind of thing ... and never use it?  A fairly nice piece pottery for storing garlic.  Why would I get rid of that?  Well, I always buy my garlic in jars - already chopped and ready to go.  I did use it once or twice but kept forgetting it had garlic in it!! I threw away a lot of dried up garlic using that pottery.  Stopped using it years ago.A pink bag clip that held absolutely nothing closed.  And a jar candle.  That candle was used as a door stop in the condo and was left by the previous owner.  I couldn't throw it away because it was perfectly fine.  But I seldom burn candles and when I do I prefer soy candle wax because it leaves less soot on my walls.A pair of drug store readers - from my husband when he could partly see.  They were #5s - they don't sell #5 in the store.  They had to be special ordered.Some of this is going in the trash and some of it will be donate to my local church thrift shop!Seriously, this first week has been a breeze.  I am sure it will get harder because I have done a lot of decluttering in the past.  But it gives me peace when I move stuff out the door.Already have the stuff for week #2 collected.  I just need the discipline to sit down and do the post!!"},
{"title": "Making Space For What Matters", "date": "Monday, November 2, 2020", "text": "I used to participate in 'blog challenges' when the idea of blogging was new-ish and I was looking for content to write about.  Over time I drifted away from that kind of activity - enjoying just reading some of the posts that others provided.Over the month of October a few blogs I follow were participating in a decluttering challenge.  It was called 30 Days to Less or Minimalism is a Journey.  The premise each day's decluttered items matched the number of the date in October ... and you picture them on your blog before removing them from your home. For example: October 1 - one item, October 2 - two items, and so on.  At first I thought the idea was worthy but too small to make much of an impact ... until we got to the higher numbers of the month, like the 20th, the 21st, ..... the 30th and the 31st!!!  Then the impact got to be substantial and challenging because it was a daily activity with increasing numbers of items with each passing day.  In fact on the final day some bloggers totaled up the discard items to discover that during October they had decluttered close to 500 items.  I consider that very substantial.  I found this challenge about day 10 - and although I was tempted to join in, I didn't see the point of starting in the middle. (an OCD part of my personality that slips into perfection. *sigh*)So here we are on November 2nd - and one of the participants (Beckie at http://www.Fieldlilies.blogspot.com) decided to continue the challenge and less deadline driven stress.  It is called Making Space - Declutter 10 items a week - and if life gets in the way - you might miss a week, but the goal is to post 10 items weekly on the day of your choosing. That would play out to only 40 items a 4-week month as opposed to almost 500 items in a month!  Doable and also significant.  I will say the title of this challenge, Making Space, has always been the entire reason I have decluttered.  It is the positive stimulus at the end that motivates me to clean things out.  The older I get the more I feel the need for an uncluttered environment. I know that clutter for some is a mental stressor.  For me it is a de-motivator to everything else in my life.  So I joined!I am also hoping this practice - besides making space in my condo - will make me a more frequent blogger.  I certainly have fallen off the wagon over the last few months.  I blame it on the pandemic - but in truth - it is just plain laziness on my part.  It takes a certain amount of discipline to post regularly and that is what I have been lacking.  Thank you Beckie for the gentle nudge resulting in a worthy effort! My declutter posts will be published mid-week - Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday - like Beckie's.  My mind is buzzing already with items on the way out.  Lets see how far this goes!"},

{"title": "Slipping", "date": "Wednesday, October 21, 2020", "text": "So much is slipping past me these days.Imagine my shock when I discovered that time had slipped so far from my last post of August 31st.    We have also slipped into Fall in my little portion of the earth.  The colors aren't in full bloom yet, which seems odd as we are facing Halloween.  The weather has been so odd.  Guess Mother Nature is confused.  But the days are getting shorter - so there is no missing what is happening.  I like Fall, but my very favorite season is Winter.  And I have totally slipped off my 'knitting mojo' this summer.  I blame it on the pandemic.  The picture above shows my garter stitch blanket I started in March 2020 done in double worsted weight acrylic.  We finished I just couldn't keep it.  It was too heavy, too big, and filled with too many thoughts related to being Covid 19 home bound.  Just not happy thoughts.  It is now on it way to a thrift shop. As much as I like to think this world event hasn't impacted me all that much ... it has.  Something inside me has slipped and my focus on my usual passions like knitting has shifted to more pensive pursuits ... no deadlines to meet, no forced expectations.   The picture above is a sport weight silk scarf for my daughter.  Very soft and squishy - and almost done.   It is like I have given myself permission to back away from artificial structures like a to-do list and just go with the flow of doing what seems right at the moment.  Eventually I get around to doing things that actually needs doing (like laundry or vacuuming) - but the world doesn't end because I let something slip to several days later.  Is it the pandemic or just my age that makes me rebel against expectations.  Probably both.  Taking time to just \"be\" has worked pretty well in noticing Aja's continued transition.  She is spreading her 'imaginary wings' and claiming her rightful place in our home - more and more every day.  The picture below is proof positive Aja visits the living room - looking out the living room window at the night. When Milo comes for a visit, she makes a point several times of day of coming out of the bedroom - sort of a 'statement' that she is the rightful owner and Milo is the guest.  That is true, of course.  She runs  back to the bedroom if he starts to walk to her - but she continues to make the effort.  Maybe someday they will be friends.  Here she sits on my lap - brief visits but frequent.  At some point she will relax, I am sure.She gets on my lap almost every day - sometimes twice in the period of an hour.  She still struggles with feeling comfortable there, but just like everything else she will grow into it.  She has found her perfect hiding place in a plush little bed I put in the bottom of my husband's closet.  She still enjoys her sunny out-in-the-open bed by the window.  And just this week, I found her sitting by an open window enjoying the fresh air - I think she has finally adjusted to the outside neighborhood noise.  The biggest leap has been her adjustment to my husband.  She will always be a \"woman's\" cat, but she allows him to pet her as long as he doesn't extend that petting session for too long.  He is the 'cat feeder' and she loves her food - so as time goes on she will include him into her circle of trusted people.She is kind of camera shy so getting good pictures of her is a challenge. My other priority during this time of Covid has been my grand daughter.  I see her less often now that she has returned to day-care, so when we finally get together I can readily notice how quickly she is advancing in her language skills, her imaginary play and her concept development.  And for some darn reason she looks forward to coming to my house - 'grandma's house!'  Last time she visited she was scheduled to come to my house for a sleepover after her nap!  When she awoke she told her mother she would pee and have her apple juice at my house rather than doing it before she left.  hahaha! Love that kid.  It couldn't be that I have something new and different when she comes every time.  Last weekend, she got to be a \"princess\" in this dress I bought her - complete with a crown, long gloves, necklace and wand!  Best $25 I ever spent!!  I love this picture of her in her princess regalia - holding an iPad! Sort of a mixture of two worlds!I keep telling her to aim for Queen - don't mess with this princess stuff.  Be the one in charge!  She is only 2 so we have many molding years ahead of her! Time slips pretty darn fast, however, every time I see her and discover how quickly she grows and develops.  It is a joy to witness but also a sadness.  I want to hold her back just a little to enjoy the beauty and wonder of every stage.  Some day her grandma might be too old her for, not able to keep up with her, or her friends are more important that this old lady ... it is the way of things as they grow ... so these times now are precious in my heart.Everything is not \"sweetness and light.\"  I hate this new blogger platform.  Why can't they just leave it alone!! But I hate the thought of starting over on another blog system more than sticking with this one.  So I will soldier on ... complaining all the way.And then I discovered today that about 50 emails in my gmail account were incorrectly directed to Spam.  That is where blog posts from others are directed - to my gmail account.  I thought my blog friends were particularly quiet recently, but I didn't wonder if it was an error.  I read many but too many to try and comment.  Can't help wondering if my computer has a bug of some sort. So that is my story here on the East Coast of the USA.  We are 2 weeks from our Presidential Election.  The heat of that has become as hot as the sun!  We need a change back to civility ... we need to return to Country First - not Party First!  I think we need new leadership to make that happen.  I am so tired of all the hate talk, the acts of violence and the insults.  We need to be civil - and we need a leader who at least knows the definition of that word.  I am tired of seeing out Democracy slipping away!  Hoping for a change at the top!"},

I didn't get a picture ... but I SWEAR it happened!!", "date": "Monday, August 31, 2020", "text": "That Aja.  Just when I think she has stopped evolving, she surprises me.I know I have been absent from my blog for over a month.  It has been a busy summer and there was just no time.  But things are slowing down now and just today, a miracle happened.I mean we have seen a number of smaller miracles in her short time with us.Over all, she does a lot that tells me she is happy to be with us.  She likes to rub against us, she enjoys a short scratch or rub around her cheeks and neck, and she joins us for short visits into the living room, kitchen or dining room.  Home base is still our bedroom, of course.  But she always runs out of the bedroom to welcome us when we come home.  She is very interested in her meals, escorting us in a \"short parade\" from the kitchen to the cat food trays in the bedroom and enjoys looking out the bedroom windows at the birds and people.  Small miracles all ... considering how stressed out she was when she arrived 3 months ago.But she still has her limits.  Does she let me pick her up?  Oh, no.  Does she come into the living room and sleep on the furniture or visit with guests?  Nope. Does she want to cuddle with us?  Most definitely not!  And just last week I attempted to place her on my lap!  I told my husband that she probably will never be a lap cat! No matter.  She gives what she can and we are happy to oblige her.And then today she came out into the living room - arrived at my chair and jumped onto my lap!  It wasn't entirely a relaxed action.  She was resting on her feet for about 20 seconds. I tried to act like she did this every day.  Ha! And then she settled down on her side and let me rub her cheeks.  And she was purring.  At some point I pulled my hand away to rest on the arm of the chair - and she hissed and smacked my hand with her paw.  I have learned that this hiss reaction means one of 2 things:  Don't stop!  or Stop! So I started scratching her cheek again.  And then after another minute, I could tell she was ready for me to stop.  I pulled my hand away again.  And after about another 30 seconds she jumped down with a parting hiss.  That hiss in most cats is a warning sign of significance.  But not in Aja.  It is just like another way of talking along with her chirps and purrs and meows!  It all fits into the context of what is going on - whether is is negative or positive.She is a complicated lady!"},
{"title": "Some of this ... some of that!", "date": "Tuesday, July 7, 2020", "text": "For some reason getting a post published lately to this blog has been difficult.  My days have gotten busier I guess.FAMILY Recently family time has increased.  Not seeing my adult kids and my grand baby really began to weigh heavy on me.My son and his wife work from home now and having a 2 year old around make for difficult productivity.  So I have been spending 3 days from 9 until 2-ish, at their house playing with Esk.Here she is 'cooking.\"  I love seeing her use her imagination.  She really does imitate what she sees.And, of course, there is swing time in the yard.  They recently moved to a larger house and with that move came more space inside and out.  There is a lovely swing set in the yard.  Esk loves to swing.  She is big on saying \"faster, faster, faster\" until she is going as high as the swing allows.  And if she doesn't think she is high enough, she gets grumpy!  She also loves to play hide-and-seek - her own version of the game, of course.  Her favorite spot to hide (her only spot to hide) is under the covers in the center of her parents' bed, then she tells me to go to her bedroom - which is down the hall.  Then I am instructed to come back and 'find' her.  She doesn't grasp the fact that I helped hide her.  😂😂😂😂 It is hysterical.So as I walk down the hall from her bedroom to 'find' her, our game goes something like this:Me:   Where is Esk?  I can't seem to find her.Esk:  (no sound)Me:   Is Esk in this bathroom?  I don't see her.Esk:  (no sound)Me:   Is Esk in this closet?  Nope, not there!! (as I get closer to her parents' bedroom.)Esk:  (little giggle)Me:   Is Esk in her parents' bedroom?  hmmm ... I don't know.Esk:  (more giggle and a little shake of the blanket)Me:   Maybe I should check under the bed!  Or maybe daddy's closet!  Or maybe mommy's bathroom!Esk:  (small squeal and squished down to make her bump smaller)Me:   Or maybe, just maybe ... she is under this COVER!!!  (Lifting the cover to reveal her.)Esk:   (Big squeal and laughter.). Esk want more hide!!!  Help me grandma!  And when I suggest that it is my turn to hide, she is most distraught - so the game is really Esk Hide and Grandma Go Seek! I'll play the game anyway she wants!!  We are keeping the social distancing bubble in place by associating only with those who have minimal contact with others. So far that has worked well for my son, daughter and daughter-in-law. AJAAja's personality is becoming more known over time.  She is friendly.  She purrs.  She loves her food! She talks all the time.  And when she is not happy, we are getting better at reading her body language. (A very important skill.  Ha!)She loves her bed by the window!!I think she has even put on a little weight.She lets you pet her (within reason ... within \"her reason\" ... so knowing when to stop is important.)  She is exploring the condo more and more.  But holding her in your arms or on your lap is not high on her list ... yet.  She is learning to live with 2 humans in her \"family,\" but not big on company of others - human or dogs (although she seems to like my daughter.)  Yep!  She is on my bed - even without an invite!  We have taken to calling her \"our little diva.\"  Just like a \"diva\"we try to judge her 'boundaries' - giving her just enough but not too much of anything.  That expression says \"Yep!  I own this bed, too!! 😍It has been hugely helpful to be in semi-regular contact with her first \"mom.\"  I discovered just last week that Aja's birthday was in July 2016 - meaning she is just now turning 4.  Occasionally touching base with this lady has made Aja less of a mystery to us.  We are very lucky to have made contact!  Aja's previous mom has been our \"user's manual\" for this feline!!DE-STRESSINGLow level stress with the pandemic, the combative political climate (an election year) and the heart- breaking images of the race issues has a been a constant. In some ways the rise of personal cells phones has made it clear just how ugly the underbelly of our country is right now.  And that is a good thing!  You can't change a problem if you don't think there is a problem.  Changing our leadership in November is the first step.  No ... let me correct that.  The first step is peaceful protest!  Which is our right!! And a LOT of it.  The second step is getting leaders in place that will correct all the wrongs of the last 4 years.  There is a lot of work to do.But how to de-stress from all the terrible events of 2020!!  I always seem to fall back on \"making space in my environment.\"  Declutter!  Nothing else does that trick for me.  Not even knitting.  Spending so much time at home now - thinning the belongings has become a regular routine rather than a single seasonal binge event.  It started with downsizing my yarn stash which began to feel like a burden.  If you had told me 10 years ago that too much yarn would be burden, I would have thought you insane.  But as time has passed that thought weighs on me ... I couldn't possibly live long enough to knit it all.  And that mind set spreads into other areas of the condo.  Each day I put one bag together of stuff and carry it out of the condo to ... somewhere!  Ironically finding ways to donate stuff during this pandemic has been challenging now that Good Will is closed.  Thankfully I found a Church Thrift Shop not too far from my condo - and they are happy to receive new \"inventory.\" And as I have discovered many times before, I seldom think about the things I get rid of ... once they are gone... so how important were they anyway??PANDEMICThis virus is going to be with us a long time.  Building habits now on what can be sustained is how I  think about this summer.What I can sustain is:Hands washing, hand sanitizer, social distancing and masksSmall groups only of folks who follow #1Eating carry out - no eat in restaurantsBeing content with home based pursuits  Since I don't work outside the house - those 4 points are do-able.  What I can't maintain is keeping a 'sterile field' in my home like I did in March.  Sanitizing all the groceries that came into the house, wiping down frequently touched surfaces in my house every single night, using disposable gloves all the time - too much, too much too much!  Certainly everything carries some risk - but building habits that you can consistently do for a year and half or more - is the goal for me.   Getting burned out by living in a sterile bubble and breaking that bubble for \"one fun filled weekend\" - like some have done - well, it just doesn't make sense.  As one reporter stated, it takes just one exposure at a bar - during one fun night - to undo all the things you did for months previously. Nope!  Not me.  Especially when people are still dying such miserable and lonely deaths at such high rates.So that is my This and That for now!"},
{"title": "Unveiling Aja - Chapter 3 - Little Victories", "date": "Friday, June 12, 2020", "text": "One morning, as my body began the process of waking, I turned over in my bed and saw THIS!!Seriously, I couldn't believe my eyes.  Aja, laying in the bed we bought for her.  I slowly reached for my glasses on the night stand.  She looked over her shoulder at me.  I froze not wanting to disturb this little victory.  She returned to sleep.  Even with my glasses on she was STILL there.  I wanted a picture.  I needed a picture.  I slowly reached for my phone and as I drew it towards my body, she looked over her shoulder at me again.  I froze again -  my eyes closed pretending to sleep.  She set her head down again.  I then took about 20 pictures of a cat that was not moving one little bit!!  Hahaha! Never in my wildest dreams did I even think I would get such a sense of joy from seeing a sleeping cat.  After all, sleeping is what cats are masters at.  I have 50 years worth of cat sleeping images in my brain!!  But none gave me a feeling of success, like that image.                                                And then there was today - she did THIS!!!!Yes, she is laying beside me on the bed.   She still keeps to our bedroom normally, so periodically I go in the bedroom and spend time with her.  Today I pulled back the covers of my bed and sat on the mattress.  She has become confident enough to jump up and sit by me, but today was the first time she laid down beside me.  Another victory.She won't jump to my lap when I sit in the chair.  She did that exactly twice on her own.  And when I lift her onto my lap she doesn't seem comfortable and sometimes hisses letting me know, \"Not now!!\"  So I have stopped trying to lift her or hold her.  She just isn't ready for that.  But laying beside me was a pretty big step for her.  Relaxed enough to lay on her side.  I will say her tail was wagging a bit - like she knew this action was new with me and she was feeling a bit unsure.  But she stayed for about 10 minutes.  And then she jumped down. I am still learning!The first few weeks I made all the advances with her.  Half the time she was receptive and half the time she wasn't.  In the last few weeks I have let her make all the moves.  She needs to seek me out - and she does.  That method has worked very much better.  What I REALLY want to do is pick her up and give her a great big hug!  But I resist as I know that would end in disaster.  And my goal is to avoid disasters - and even hissing episodes!  Bonding is the goal and trust takes time.  Peace is the path to both.  And I love this little lady enough to do all the steps her way.I keep forgetting.  Its been only 5 weeks.  We are on Aja's time schedule and not mine!  And she likes it that way.  Now that this approach is bearing fruit - I like it that way as well!"},
{"title": "Unveiling Aja - Chapter 2 - Two Steps Forward.  One Back.  Repeat.", "date": "Wednesday, June 3, 2020", "text": "I have come to the conclusion that of the 10 cats that previously shared our lives, Aja is the only one who was raised to be an actual cat!  😁  All our other cats came to us as kittens and although we didn't realize it at the time, I am kind of thinking we probably raised them to be dogs! haha.Sorry for the poor quality!  Aja, hunkered down under the bed!That look is not \"trusting.\"  Ha!  She had good reason.Last weekend was hard on her.First off, the weather was beautiful and cool.  Our air conditioner was off and our bedroom windows were wide open.  The curtains were billowing with a wonderful breeze.  The road noise (and we have some road noise), is a constant to our ears at times.  So constant that we just don't hear it anymore unless it is a noisy motorcycle or a fire truck - but Aja hears every sound.  And the billowing curtains???  Her look was \"My Gosh!! Are they supposed to do that??\" Sunday, when I entered the bedroom and called for her - she didn't come.  I think I was getting the cat equivalent of a cold shoulder.  I checked under the bed.  No Aja.  I checked in the bathroom and under the rocker and under the dressers.  No Aja!  My little 'worry worm' started.  I checked my husband's closet. No Aja.  Finally I moved his shirts on the lower level ... and there she was - snuggly hidden from the dog (more on him later,) and the street noise, and the breeze and the curtains.  Poor baby.  I wanted to pick her up in my arms and reassure her.  But I knew it was too early in our relationship for such familiarities.She spent most of Saturday and Sunday in my husband's closet.  I shut everything down Sunday night. It got quieter.  She got calmer.  Later I opened one bedroom window .... two inches only.  Air and some noise was allowed in but not at the same level as the weekend.  I know with time she will adjust to all this - because this is part of her reality now and there is really no choice -  but currently - she is not fan.How can you not love a sweet old face like this one!Then there is this old guy!  Milo, my daughter's French Bull Dog - one of my grand babies.  He had been here since Thursday and returned home Monday.  He only looked at her through the gate - never barked.  But his presence has been worrisome for her.  Milo can't get past the gate so the protective space barrier was solidly in place.  She calmed a bit. This morning I moved the new donut bed into the area of the closet she likes to hide.  That was a mistake!  She decided she doesn't like me messing with her hiding places.  Now she is back under the bed.Her hissing responses increased in a really schizoid-like way.  She rubs against my legs purring, back and forth watching out the bedroom door, then she smells my hand (I am sure Milo's scent is on me), she hisses and then turns and rubs against my legs again, then hisses, and repeat.  She is very confused.  I look and sound the same, but my smell is not quite right. I go and wash my hands. She calms. How to explain all this to her.  I thought I was speaking \"cat\" all this time, but maybe I was actually speaking \"dog,\" and she speaks only \"cat.\"  All my previous cats apparently understood \"dog.\" *sigh* - have I totally lost you all yet?Or maybe, there are just gaps in my understanding!  Yes, that is it.  I need more educating.So I spent time on Amazon looking at cat behavior books and found this one, highly rated, current and focused on feline behavior. Image from AmazonThis is the way I love to hold my cats! Bet Aja would think this is too familiar. The book is authored by Jackson Galaxy - a cat behaviorist and Mikel Maria Delgado, Phd, a behavior consultant for Feline Minds at the Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.  Apparently Jackson hosts an Animal Planet hit show and is the author of other books related to cats.  Mikel studied animal behavior and human-animal relationships at the University of California, Berkeley.  This book had the focus on behavior I was looking for - rather than just dedicating one chapter to behavior and other chapters all other cat care topics. Perfect! I also downloaded a few free Kindle offerings.  I am determined to not make too many backward steps with Aja.Then I checked the calendar!  She has been with us just about 4 weeks.  Only 4 weeks!  Gosh ... I have heard adjustment time spans of up to 18 months!!  Maybe I am just rushing things.  Maybe I am speaking \"cat\" after all - and she doesn't like what I am saying.Maybe I am over thinking this!!  hahaha.Oh well, can't hurt to check out a few references. Post Script:  Just before publishing this post, two major Aja advancements happened. Aja left the safety of under the bed and rubbed up against my husband's legs.  Let me tell you!!  THAT made his month!  I knew ignoring her would produce a positive reaction.  Cats typically seek out anyone they 'think' doesn't like them.  It is one of the signature traits of felines - across the full spectrum of the cat world.  A little reverse psychology works wonders.And around dinner time she walked right out the bedroom and made her way into the living room - in front of us - while we were eating dinner at the table.  I cautioned my husband:No sudden moves or loud noises,no coughing, sneezing, or swallowing that food you put in your mouth ...  just act natural ... maybe stop breathing for a minute or two while she checks things out!!  😀And she did just that!  She walked right up to my husband's chair and did her side rub back and forth!  A typical cat method of sharing their scent on things to \"make it their own.\"  It lasted for all of 5 minutes!  But, hey, that was brave, brave, brave on her part.  And after she ran back into the bedroom I told her that!!So maybe I don't need a book.  Maybe I am speaking \"cat!\"  Or maybe she is learning \"dog!\"Or maybe we are just developing a new language between us ... Aja Language!I sure do love this crazy cat!"},
{"title": "Unveiling Aja", "date": "Sunday, May 31, 2020", "text": "Our journey with Aja has been like a grand \"unveiling.\" A slow, deliberate lifting of the veil she uses to cover her personality.She is a beauty!You see, when you adopt a kitten, there is no veil or curtain.  It is all typically about play and adventure and wonder and fun and discovery and cuddles and sometimes mistakes and craziness.  Kittens are \"all out there.\"  Being cautious lasts about 5 or 10 minutes.  Tops!  Finding your 2 pound fur ball hanging from a curtain rod or off your jeans (while you are wearing them, of course) or pitifully caught in a tight place, or darting between your legs in sudden fits and starts ... all of that is just Kittenhood 101!Favorite spot!Adopting an adult cat is none of that.  It more like studying for a Phd without books or lectures and Cliff Notes.  You don't even get a syllabus or an advisor.  Adopting an adult cat is like purchasing a \"surprise package\" where you don't know what's inside the box until you open it up.  And the first order of business is gently picking the virtual scotch tape off the wrapping paper without upsetting the contents (otherwise known as 'the cat.')  And that is where we started with Aja.The first thing she shared with us was how talky she is.  Many meows, trills, purring, short little squeak sounds that have meaning only to her at present. And she loves to be talked to!  All that aside, she isn't shy at setting you straight with a hiss, either.  Although we have no rules when it comes to cats, she apparently has a few rules when it comes to owners.  Haha!  Good thing I am a fast learner!!Husband spending time trying to make friends.Look at her beautiful markings.The next discovery was the sinuous rubbing of her body against our legs.  She loves to do that.  She is friendly - in the extreme at times - happy to be scratched around the cheeks and ears and neck.  And when she has had enough - She Is D-O-N-E.  And don't ask for more.  It's her time table - not yours.  When her 'happy dance' is over, she is on to other things.Gate is wide open - but unless it is dark and quiet - she typicallywon't come out.  At least not yet.  Can't help but wonderwas is going on in that tiny mind of hers.But as the owner, it is important that I control the narrative (or at least give the illusion that I am in control. 😆)  For example - lifting her onto the bed, onto her cube by the window, and onto my lap has shorten the time she would take to do these things independently on her own.   The first time doing anything she is tense and anxious.  Her picture is in the dictionary next to the word CAUTIOUS!  Tail is intensely whipping back and forth, eyes darting every which way before she jumps down. But within a short time she spontaneously returning to that scary \"whatever\" and shows off her mastery of it ... acting like it is no big deal!  Ha!One of her beds - the cube.  A hiding place and a perch place in one.She still sleeps under our bed!  *sigh*   My other cats never used a cat bed. Their bed was where we slept and they graciously shared 'their bed' with us.  Maybe she will do that someday, but 'someday' could be a ways off.  So I bought 2 pet beds.  One bed is the donut shape placed in my husband's closet (she visits there), and the other one is the cube that functions like a bed she can hide in and perch on while watching out the window.  She has checked out both, but use them??  Not to sleep in.  She still creeps under the bed.  The vet said to give her time. My friend who has homed feral cats said the same thing.  It may take her 18 months to sleep in one of those beds.  Or maybe never.  Cats do what they want to do, when they want to do it. and how they want to do it.Half the time she looks out - and half the time she looks in.She loves sitting on our window sills.  Since she is half the weight of our other big male cats - her little butt actually fits on our window sill.  Half the time she is watching out our windows at the world outside ... and half the time she is looking at the world inside!  I guess we haven't gotten boring yet.Poor picture due to night lighting, but she is on the left technicallyin our kitchen which is right outside thebedroom door to the left.Another poor lighting picture.  She is looking into the denwhich is right outside our bedroom door to the right.Her current big adventure is the condo space beyond our her bedroom.  Under her own steam she has stepped outside the bedroom almost every day for the last week ... a few inches more each time.  Usually she makes these forays when the house is very quiet and dark, and we are quietly reading.  But yesterday I was standing in the kitchen (during the bright light of day, TV blaring, and microwave humming - you know - normal stuff) and I looked down and found her almost standing in the kitchen.  We were both surprised.  Her eyes were huge like saucers - mine too!  Then the ice maker did its thing and dropped a load of ice in the bin!!   Too much, too much, too much!  Gone.  Being female, (and the business end of the species,) she knows instinctively that monsters may live out there!  Can't be too careful - that is clearly a motto tattooed in her tiny cat brain!Milo, my French Bulldog 'Grandson' looking into the bedroom at  Aja.Aja acting causal as she carefully extracts herself fromunder the rocking chair while being observed byMilo.This weekend we raised the level of excitement a bit.  My daughter's French Bulldog, Milo, came for a visit.  As you can imagine, Aja was not amused.  There was a return to hissing and tail swishing!  All behind the safety of her gate and under the rocking chair.  She stayed in her \"safe zone\" while Milo peaked in through the bars. Milo is an old guy and has little interest in cats.  He just wanted a look-see!  After a few hours she settled down.  She made the connection that the gate protected her from the \"monster\" that had just arrived.  Now she sits calming staring out at him.  Maybe one day she will be as comfortable as Wally was with Milo.Feeding time.  She gets both dry and wet. Initially we weren't surewhat she preferred to eat.  Now we now she likes wet foodbut snacks on dry.  My husband is the feeder - hiseffort to make friends with Aja - who is still very unsure about him.She still seems to favor me, much to my husband's chagrin.  The last 2 cats favored my husband.  He doesn't give up easy and keeps trying to win her over.  I tell him to just ignore her.  Cats can't stand to be ignored!  If you try too hard, they can't be bothered.  So he is doing his best to give her space and time.  And he is the official feeder!  You know, just to show off his good side to Aja.  Meanwhile, she is all over me!  Haha! Another truism about cats - they pick their people and you have no say in the matter.She like the little laser light (left little bright spot on the carpet.)Her first visit to the vet was May 22.  We anticipated a \"betrayal of the shaky trust\" we had carefully nurtured.  Cats normally don't equate good vet care with loving pet ownership. But we do.  As it turns out it wasn't that scary a trip for her.  I had to stay in the parking lot, of course, pandemic protocols, so she had to brave the vet's office on her own.  Apparently she did fine.  I warned them that she is a hisser and a smacker when anxious, but not known to be aggressive.  And sure enough the vet got one of each after micro chipping her!!  Our vet agreed with the shelter and our assessment that she was not aggressive.  Just frightens easily. The ride in the car was uneventful.  That is a big improvement over Wally who would vomit all over the inside of his carrier and yowl the whole trip.  Poor boy!  Nerves and maybe car sick.  Not her!  Not a sound.  Considering she hisses at a bunch of little things and 'talks' up a mean-streak at home, I was surprised the car ride was so quiet.  She looked all around! (Monsters could be anywhere you know!!)She has finally got comfortable enough to pose and let me take pictures of her.Finally, I had the good fortune to communicate with her previous owner.  The Surrender Form included that information.  Since Aja was a mystery wrapped up in orange fur, I wanted to know more.  I plugged the owner's name into Facebook on the off chance I could find her.  Success!  I took a chance and shot off an email. I know that some might have not appreciate a message from the new owner.  But I wanted to share that Aja landed in a good home and was doing well.  Thankfully, she did respond and was very happy to hear from me. She was grateful that Aja was with us - patient and experienced cat parents.  Although she had to give Aja up due to a distance move, she had kept tabs on her through the shelter website and knew she had been adopted.  Not knowing how Aja was doing was hard.  Hopefully now Aja's first 'mom' has some peace of mind about Aja's future. And for me, it was nice to have confirmation that the Aja I am getting to know is pretty much unchanged from her former life and that she had a good home with her previous 'mom.'  I invited her to visit this blog occasionally to keep up with Aja as she begins her new life with me.\"OK, I am done for today!  Please go away now!\"  hahahaAs each day that passes, Aja is a little less of a mystery.  We are past the 'virtual scotch tape and wrapping paper' stage.  We have opened the lid to look carefully at the contents - at least as much as she is willing to show us now ... and she is carefully looking back!The adventure continues!"},

{"title": "Aja", "date": "Friday, May 15, 2020", "text": "So here she is ... all 7 or 8 pounds of her!  The smallest full grown cat we have ever had.  And getting pictures of her has been a challenge.  She can be ellusive.Aja actually entered our home under the name of Asia.  That is what the shelter had for her name.  But when we got home we noticed on the previous owner's surrender form - her name was Aja!  After about 24 hours we decided to keep her name as Aja.Aja is our second female cat (out of 11) and our first orange tabby!  She is also our first adult adoption.She has beautiful markings but you can see here that herstomach sinks in.  This picture is from day 1.Our first evening at home with Aja was fairly quiet.  She came out from under the bed to visit the litter box - once.  No food or water, but the box got a visit.  Ok, normal.  But around bedtime my husband and I were both in the bedroom together and I think that made her nervous.  She couldn't watch us both at the same time.  At one point my husband - who is legally blind - stepped on her.  The very first night!!  He was devastated.  She was pissed!!  Hissing and swatting at him as he tried to get on the floor to 'apologize.'  She didn't know what he was doing and that was upsetting her too.  I said to stand and just ignore her.  Give her space to recover herself.  That night she let me pet her.  But it was a troublesome start.She sleeps during the day ... and under the bed.  Periodically each day I would slip my hand down between the bed and the wall and she would rub against it.  And then she would come out.  On day 2 she began to eat.  That was a great relief to us.We are now at day 5 she is making strides at trusting us and we are making strides at reading her body language.  She expresses anxiety with rapidly wagging tail, then a hiss, maybe a short growl and finally a paw swipe (nails retracted) ... all in that order.  Once I figured that out, we were golden.  Thankfully the things she is anxious about are reducing.   In fact, that sequence has almost totally gone away - as she has relax somewhat in her new environment.  Poor little girl.  She must have hated the last two weeks in the shelter. There have been a bunch of fun mini steps in her adjustment.  Like the night when I was sitting in the bedroom rocker.  My husband was asleep, the lights were out and I was reading my Kindle.  She had been rubbing my legs when suddenly she jumped up into my lap.  I think we were both stunned!!  She sat there watching for my reaction and I was doing the same with her.  Her eyes were on me and her tail was waving.  Anxiety!  I gently rubbed her under her chin. She relaxed and the tail settled.  Actually we both relaxed!  Hahaha.  She lasted for about 45 seconds, then jumped down.  Next time it will be longer.Now she comes out from under the bed (where she still sleeps) at the sound of my voice calling her.  She looks for affection.  She is checking us out for any rules - little does she know - there are no rules!! Ha.The gate separates our bedroom and bathroom from the rest ofthe condo so that our cat has a safe zone when company isaround.  We kept is closed the first 3 days.The last two days we left it open. She still chooses to stay in the bedroom.And just so you know, the gray cat in the picture -lower left corner, is a wood carving door stop.  :-)It sure looks interestingout there.  L-)She still self-contains herself in the bedroom.  She is familiar with the space now, and food and litter are readily available.  She sometimes sits and looks out the gate at the rest of the condo, but her tail starts to wave and I know she is still unsure.  One time she stepped past the open gate and crept out about 4 steps - stopped - and ran back with belly to the ground.  With time she will be a bit more adventuresome, but for now she is happy to stick in her \"safe zone.\"  But she does continue to look.But even with the gate openshe isn't sure the time is right!Today I decided it was time to see if she could tolerate me lifting her.  So I lifted her onto our bed.  It was a fast movement and she did not object.  I picked her up two other times today.  All to the bed.  She did fine.   Later my husband and I were on the bed, he was listening to an audio book and I was talking to her.  She jumped right up on the bed - without an invite.  And she stayed with us a bit.So all in all ... she is doing great!!  The rate of her adjustment is progressing!  We got lucky.  I think she is a great cat with a recent bad experience.  And she got lucky to.  We have 50 years of cat ownership under our belt.  We can be patient and understand the language of \"cat\" very well.As I fall in love with this little creature, I can't help but remember that she is a heartbreak waiting in the wings of my life at some future date.  I wonder why I do this to myself when their lives are so short compared to ours - and then she rubs up against my legs purring and I remember.  Love from a pet holds no judgement.  Yes, you must earn it, but once earned - you are their 'person' until they take their last breath.Here's hoping you keep breathing for a long time, dear Aja!"},
{"title": "Our Small Miracle", "date": "Thursday, May 14, 2020", "text": "After 2 weeks without our dear cat, Wallace, we knew we wanted to adopt another cat.  This time an adult. Adults are sometimes hard to place.  It would be our very first adult adoption.  We thought it would be easy - since there are so many wonderful pets needing a home.  Generally you just needed to whisper ... hey, I might want to adopt an animal ... and the array of choices is made available to you.Not so during a pandemic.  All the rules change.  Not only can you not just walk into a shelter without an appointment, but the selection of animals is much reduced.  Apparently adoptions are way up in this time of self isolation according to the shelter we used.  That bit of knowledge I found concerning.  After all, we aren't always going to be self isolated.  This is a temporary measure.  But pets are not temporary.  What happens after everyone returns to work??To spread the adoption net as far as I could I let everyone know we were looking - including our vet.  After 3 days of waiting for a nibble on my  'adoption fishing net' I started looking at shelters online myself.I found a site near us called Small Miracles.  They had four adult cats - all female - between the ages of 2-4.  I sent an email.  No response.  I filled out the online application form and sent it with a second email.  No response.  I called and left a message.  No response.  (Seriously - how serious were they about finding homes if I had to work this hard?) One of my neighbors works there as a volunteer.  I emailed her.  She said she would contact them - and sure enough the shelter emailed me back.  We made an appointment.It was at Small Miracles where we met Asia.  She is a 4 year old orange tabby - a tiny little beauty.  As we walked toward her cage she was sitting in a haunch position in her litter - a sign that she was not at ease.  When we reached the cage and poked our fingers through - she came to us and began rubbing and purring.  The shelter rep said she seemed friendly, no sign of aggression, does hiss at times but they interpreted as an anxiety response.  From the look of her body language at my first sight of her, I agreed.  When I asked how long she was there - they said 2 weeks.  My heart fell for this pretty girl who was obviously not at ease there and had been release by her previous owner (she was moving) from a home environment to this painful impersonal situation.  At least her owner took her to a \"no kill\" shelter, but I can't even imagine what Asia was thinking during those two weeks.  Two weeks is a long time when you are miserable.I should say, I am terrible at shelter visits.  I am motivated to adopt everything in sight. My heart goes out to any animal that is forced to stay there more than a few days. I hate the look and feel of animal shelters. They are noisy, not terribly clean and personal interaction with the animals seems limited to meeting just physical needs as opposed to emotional ones.  And that is the situation for all the animals that shelters deem as 'adoptable.'  You usually don't see the ones who aren't adoptable.  I get it ... I really do ... no time to give full attention to any one little being.  Just a sad environment all around for me.Asia came home with us that very day.The shelter staff said she hissed at them when she was put in our carrier.  Pretty sure it was anxiety, they said.The trip home was pretty quiet.  She tried pushing against the carrier, but mostly just sat still looking all around.  When we got home, we took her right into our bedroom and bathroom combination - her home until she was relaxed enough to explore the rest of the condo.Upon being released, she did a fast scan of the two rooms (looking for monsters I am sure 😟,) took note of the litter box and the water, and then slipped under the bed.Next up ... pictures and her first 24 hours."},
{"title": "Listen and Push Back ", "date": "Monday, April 27, 2020", "text": "Without detailing the current state of our wounded world ...  a need grew in me to push back.I have had my fair share of \"hits\" this spring.  The pandemic started this tsunami of hits beginning with isolation protocols (even from family) and fears of infection for ourselves and our loved ones, followed by the health decline of my cat, Wally, continuing to his death ... and finally topped off with the very serious news that a close family member is being placed on a Transplant list due to kidney failure ... well, the hits just seemed to keep coming this spring.  The last \"hit\" is not totally unexpected as our family has dealt the kidney disease for a long time - but it is a particularly difficult when you can't put your arms around them.  What I can do is see if I am a compatible donor - my very personal and determined way of pushing back on a personal tsunami.  For now - enough said on that. At the very basic level - my first \"push back\" is with my knitting.  Unfortunately when I am very upset and distracted, I don't get that positive bump or settling feeling from sitting and knitting (or any other craft) during tough times like so many others.  I usually lose the desire to knit entirely.  I do better getting up and cleaning. (An aside: my condo is now cleaner than it has been in a long time.). I also like to declutter because that down feeling creates a very realistic filter to my 'pitch it out' decisions - do I care enough to keep an item in my current upset state?  It is amazing how much a down attitude crystalizes my \"keep it or pitch it\" decision making.  But this week I decided that I would push myself beyond cleaning into knitting.  After all, I have a room full of yarn and it isn't getting smaller just by sitting there.It started with a cable vest pattern for my grand daughter and even though I am almost half way through it, I kept putting it down after one row.  A little voice in my head said, \"Maybe this pattern isn't the right thing for you to knit right now.\"I had been thinking to work on a blanket small enough to use in a child's bed so I picked out a selection of Caron Simply Soft acrylic (my go-to acrylic when I knit for kids) and started out with an appealing crochet pattern (you know how fast crochet can be), but I found myself making the blanket wider and wider with each row. Ha!  I don't really understand the crochet stitch well enough to be any good at it and now is not the time to add complexity to anything.  I ripped it out after 4 inches.  I needed to go back to the thing I know best.  Knitting.Looking through Ravelry at patterns and saw a bunch of beautiful blanket designs, but instead of feeling excited about them - I felt dread!!  Can you believe it?? Unbelievable. No sense starting a project with such negative emotions just by looking at the pictures.  My emotions are so mixed up right now.Then I stumbled across Purl Soho's Super Easy Lap Blanket.  Basically, cast on a bunch of stitches, knit every row, slip the first stitch for an even edge, and if you are changing colors just knit until you finish the first skein of color and change colors.  FINALLY I found something I can do.  And no dread!What is hysterical, there are actual instructions on the PurlSoho website for this pattern.  haha!  The instructions take up 1/2 page.  Mine took up 4 lines.  I decided to double the yarn and use 10.5 knitting needles to add speed and body to the project. I am happy with it.  I love Caron Simply Soft as an affordable acrylic and it is working up beautifully.  Something that would usually bore me to tears is now giving me peace.  And it will make a substantial dent in my yarn stash.  Win-win.While working on it I thought about Elizabeth Zimmerman and her love of garter stitch patterns.  I have several of her books.  I need to take a second look at those projects.  I remember they were simple in design but classic in style.  In fact, I remember reading one of her books written in her own words and discovered how much fun it was to read her thoughts.  She didn't stress over anything and all things knitting were do-able. Maybe I should open one of those and read a bit.And then I remembered the Sally Melville books:  The Knit Stitch (Book #1), The Purl Stitch (Book #2), and Color, (Book #3.). I have all 3 books - they survived the declutter purge from moving.  I pulled them out and decided that maybe I would make an Einstein Jacket - an older pattern found in The Knit Stitch  book - I remembered a yarn in my stash that just might work for that pattern.  I got up and searched to the yarn of my memory.  Yep!  I still had it.  Top right skeins are sock weight and will make a nice matching scarf.The yarn band said it was bulky weight yarn best used with a #10 knitting needle!  Eureka!!  Exactly what the pattern said was needed.   And in a stunning twist of serendipity - the rust color used in the book is exactly the color of the yarn I have for this project. It was like starting a small fire by rubbing 2 sticks together, getting a tiny spark, adding some kindling, blowing on it to build a small fire and finally creating something that could keep you warm! Nothing has changed, of course.  I am still self isolating with little family contact and will continue probably another 4 weeks, Wally is still gone forever and we are cat-less for the first time in 50 years of marriage, and my family member still needs a kidney for a quality life - a life I dearly want to preserve.  But I have found a small bit of peace in a world that seems to be spinning out of control all around me.And maybe (a small voice in my head keeps repeating) just the act of pushing back - doing something that seems right is what you need to do now.  Maybe listening to that small voice in myself was the goal to begin with.While not a traditionally spiritual person, I do believe in God, but I don't believe in waiting for God to save me from life.  I believe in a God who gave me two amazing gifts to handle life: a brain that sits atop of the animal kingdom in complexity and free will.  He expects me to use my gifts. I don't wait around for God to fix life for me. At the risk of offending someone with this cartoon, I feel it nails exactly my relationship with God and how I am handling this pandemic!Grabbed from FacebookListen to the small voices and push back ..."},

{"title": "Keep Your Parachute On", "date": "Friday, April 17, 2020", "text": "Found on Facebook - no idea who to really credit!The StruggleSo, here I sit 4 1/2 weeks or so into this 'Stay at Home' thing we have been ordered to do - and I thought I was nailing it mentally.  Note - the Past Tense!I'm not.  I'm restless.  This new antsy feeling, however, won't change a thing regarding Covid-19 protection guidelines.  I will stay home bound for as long as it takes - just like everyone else should.   I am keeping my 'parachute' on.  But ... one night I went to bed feeling fine being home bound - and the next morning I woke up and realized ...  not fine. I tried to sort out why this is so.  I have a lot to keep me occupied - my life within these 4 walls is good.  And no job to worry about, no lack of food, no heath issues (thank God, because now is not the time to have a health issue of any kind!)I thought the simple answer would be \"gratitude.\"  Just be grateful.  It is sort of the new buzz word for changing your perspective on things and making you happy.  To be honest, it didn't work.  Because \"gratitude\" for material things (which I have in abundance) is just a way to fool your mind about what really feeds your soul.I determined what I was missing was my kids, my grand daughter, my grand dogs, my friends, visits to public places without fear.  It is like the mountain of 'things' available to me within the four walls of this condo are just not cutting it - a diversion for sure - but not as positive and life sustaining as I thought.I miss is seeing with my own eyes that my adult kids are happy and healthy, hugs from my grand daughter who shouts \"grama\" over and over again,  explosive rush of excitement and love I get from my grand dogs who run around like their pants are on fire for the first 5 minutes after I walk in the door, the laughter and the sharing in person with friends .... heck, even time spent with strangers without the constant reminders of masks and gloves that say - \"Stay back!! ... you might have germs.\"  That is what I miss!  It is an interesting personal discovery.  And that old life I miss might be on hold for another 12 to 18 months.What I wouldn't give to be able to just hug a complete stranger!!Upside - DownsideOn the upside - my carpet got steamed cleaned this week - looong overdue!  On the downside - the inspiration for steam cleaning is because of my cat Wally broke box training this week (almost always a sign that something is wrong.)  On the upside I got him to a vet yesterday to receive the care and meds he needed, but the downside is I spent that vet visit in the parking lot while they took care of him without me. They didn't even want my credit card - said to call when I got home. Another downside - his appetite has been way off for months and losing weight.  So in a last ditch effort to save his life, I have been force feeding him some high calorie dense nutritional value food and soon I will be manually feeding him a liquid diet - a special food on order.  Not much fun for either of us.    He has 2 ongoing medical health issues and is getting treatment for those, but his chances of making his 14th birthday in June are fading fast if he won't eat. I think the downsides within the walls of my condo are outnumbering the upsides right now.Other stuff:I finally got my kitchen floor washed.  I hear that is a thing now! :-)  I won't embarrass myself with how long it has been - but it took 3 complete washings to get it clean.  I didn't choose the ugly kitchen flooring pattern - the previous owners did.  The only positive thing about it - it doesn't show dirt!  But if it takes 3 washings to come clean - I really went to a new low in the housekeeping department.I food shop by myself now.  Most people do normally - but it is one of the things my husband enjoyed doing over the years and we always did it together.  Now that he is blind in a pandemic living in a world with many government imposed restrictions (in this area only 1 family member at a time allowed in the store)  - he doesn't even get to that simple trip.  He is the one who enjoys food shopping, but I am the one forced to do it.We are getting out for a walk several days a week.  It is for mental health more than anything.  But my legs are feeling better with exercise.  And I started taking Eggshell Membrane capsules daily and they may also be contributing to the improvement.  While this is not meant to be medical advice for anyone, it was worth an experiment for me.  Thank you, Michelle of Boulderneigh Blog.And what to say about knitting!  I have spent the last 25 years preparing for this moment.  A time when I have an enormous stash of yarn and unlimited time to sit and knit!  But focusing on any craft right now is really hard.  I probably do about 5 rows in my latest project - done while I watch TV.  But I often find myself sitting staring at the screen with my knitting in my lap - idle.  It is like my entire life - down to the littlest actions - has been interrupted and getting back on track is not on my radar either.There is a saying that you can't teach an old dog new tricks.  I used to bristle at that statement feeling in minimized senior adaptability.  Everyone can learn new tricks.  But when you have to learn new tricks for every single action in your life - that is when the truth of that saying begins to make sense.To ConcludeKeeping my parachute on,missing my loved ones,refusing to let my cat die,cleaning stuff I can't stand to look at any more,forcing myself into a grocery store,walkingwatching TVJust the same as everyone else,I guess!Stay Well Everyone!"},
{"title": "Another Week - Upside Down", "date": "Friday, April 3, 2020", "text": "Change is the only Constant in the Pandemic!On March 30 our Governor decided that too many of the population were not taking the pandemic restrictions seriously and our numbers of deaths and infections are rising quickly.  So he has locked down all but the most essential activities - \"Stay At Home\" restriction enforced now by law and punishable.  Our Governor has just lost patience with these stupid citizens and now has put some consequences in place.Amazing really.  Must be an American \"thing.\"  Some people just can't be told what to do no matter what the consequences! If they aren't careful, they could be fined or see the inside of a jail - where, by the way, the Covid-19 virus has made an entrance! Have fun, you ridiculous humans - sitting in jail AND feeling as sick as a dog!!Although it won't mean much difference to me and my out-of-condo activities (which has been limited to groceries for 3 weeks,) my life has turned upside-down once again.  My grand daughter will be staying home with her parents until the \"Stay-at-Home\" order is lifted. I suspect that will hold for some number of weeks until we hit our high point on the illness curve and begin to slow on new infections.First thought ... What does that mean for me! With a startling awareness, weeks just magically opened up completely with no child sitting😞, no family 😞, no dog sitting😞, no social engagements, no company, no meetings, no nothing!  It has been decades (literally many decades) since I have had a spell like this when I wasn't recovering from surgery or some such thing!  Just think on it ... it took a world pandemic for that to happen in my life!!When the kids left on the evening of March 30 - and I finished picking up the toys and food and various other stuff - my mind starting churning. Oh My God!  You have weeks of total uninterrupted timeto do all the stuff you have kept on the back burnerfor YEARS!! I used to keep a long term list of big stuff - nice to do stuff - stuff you do every 10 years so (maybe) - if the time is ever right (or not! and it is usually not.)  It was such a 'long time list' that I long ago tucked it away somewhere and now it cannot be found!  Ha!  What are all those things? Think, think.With out much trouble a list of stuff to do began to develop - and it is becoming very impressive.  Over ambitious, of course, but what the heck.  If some of it doesn't get done in the next 3 or 4 weeks, it isn't the end of the world.  It didn't get done for more than 10 years and nothing bad happened.  Oh wait ... there is this pandemic!!  You don't suppose ...What did I do with my days last week - the week with all the free and open time?  I started cleaning.  Yes, vacuuming, cleaning bathrooms, sanitizing, etc.  In my mind I wanted to be ready.  Ready to be sick.  Ready to step back and do nothing.  I just couldn't do that if my house needed cleaning and picking up.  I would probably drag myself around the condo still doing stuff while coughing and filled with Covid-19 germs - because I can't be sick when there is disorder around me.  I.JUST.CAN'T.  I think I am ready now.  The house is picked up and clean.  The pantry is packed, the fridge and freezer are bursting.  I can now get sick with a clear conscious.  Ha!And because of that - all that prep - I probably won't get sick!  But I swear to you, if I didn't do all that stuff, I would probably be on a ventilator somewhere struggling to breathe and worrying about the mess I left behind.Signing off for now from this upside down world!  Hope you all continue to be well in your little space on this earth.  Just stay away from everyone and you will be fine! (Oh ... and for double protection clean your house!)PS - I love the free unstructured time but I hate, hate, hate not seeing my family ... my kids, my grand daughter, my grand dogs!!"},

{"title": "End of Week Two of Self Isolation", "date": "Sunday, March 29, 2020", "text": "So far so good! Not sick.Not bored.Not crazy.Yes, not sick.  I am sort of self-isolating to avoid anyone who is not self-isolating and should be!! Every day that I wake up ok I am grateful.  I don't want this new icky virus and I don't want the flu either - which I am quite sure is still circulating and killing people as well - although we don't hear those totals.  So keeping away from almost everyone and disinfecting stuff every 24 hours kills two birds viruses at one time - I hope.  And so far I don't know anyone who has come down with Flu or Covid-19.Thankfully, not bored.   My grand daughter is with me and there is no such thing as boredom when a 2 year old is around.  Fatigue, yes.  Boredom, no.  My usual pastimes are lagging.  Not much knitting or weaving going on.  Even progress on Community Board things has slowed.  I am cooking more.  And ironically I don't seem to mind.  This is astounding because I generally hate cooking.  But there is something satisfying knowing what I am putting in my body most likely doesn't have any nasty viruses on it.  I am caught up laundry - because I just have the time.  Watching TV and reading fill about the same amount of time as before. And crazy?  Probably not!  Usually when forced to stay in the house for a long time like during a snow storm, within 3 or 4 days I get 'cabin fever.'  None of that.  But I did start thinking about seeking out some fiber events during the summer and fall.  I am pretty sure that plans of vendors and shoppers are heating up and will explode when we are finally set free to gather in groups of 10 or more and return to normal living. Hmm ... 'normal living' in this new world.  I do believe the world has shifted in subtle ways - and will never return to a previous normal.  I don't think I will ever think about public surfaces the same way ever again.  And once the new normal returns this summer, I will get ahead on some supplies like hand sanitizer and hand soap and Clorox wipes and all those things that I will need again next year - because, yes folks, we will be doing another repeat for winter 2020-2021.  Maybe not a full shut down of society, but Covid-19 illnesses will be with us again next winter.  Even with the speedy speedy development of a vaccine and discovering meds to mitigate the illness if you catch it - it won't be available until after the next 'bloom' of this virus.  When it is available I am going to be very cautious about getting that vaccine.  Even with adequate testing, new vaccines can have hidden consequences and at my age - it is best to avoid all the consequences until more is known.Meanwhile I am keeping myself busy learning to make a diluted disinfectant cleaning solution from bleach, learning to keep my hands off my face (my God, that is hard to do), and learning to treat everything outside the little sanctuary of my condo as suspicious. I celebrate the finding (like a treasure hunt) of items rare and valuable - like toilette paper, Clorox cleaning supplies, Tylenol, meat and chicken.  I am learning to live without my good friend Amazon.  *sigh*. That is the hardest lesson of all.  I didn't realize how much I relied and getting stuff by the single click of the mouse.  Delivery times on some items are long and or just simply out of stock and may not return.  I know, I know ... these are First World Problems!  I think it is good that First World folks get a peek at what Third World folks already know.

{"title": "Narrow and Wide", "date": "Tuesday, March 24, 2020", "text": "Twelve short days!How the world has narrowed down!And how it has expanded.At first it was all about \"awareness\" - watch where you put your hands, don't run short of anything, don't forget the hand cream for those over washed sore hands, keep your distance even from everyone outside your front door, Clorox wipe down surfaces at home every night, and watch your calendar disappear before your very eyes.  Very narrow close to home pursuits.  Awareness becomes habit after a bit.But the narrow focus of a 'home bound' person is new to me.  I am not clamoring to get in the car and go somewhere ... so I am not exactly suffering.  Staying at home day after day might be a problem for some, but I enjoy my home and I like the feeling that it is safe (hopefully.)There is the down side ... being kept within 4 walls with TV and the news as your wider view of the world - which is dismal still.The latest news flash this morning is a story out of Denmark - a message to the US - \"Do More -- Fast.  Don't Wait.\"  And India has locked down it's country.  Imagine that if you can!  But the latest \"news flash\" from our President (if you want to call it that) is - \"We can do two things at one time and we must 'open up our country.'\"  That is 'code' for we must get our economy opened up in the next few weeks because when the economy looks bad at election time - he might not get re-elected.  It is all about him after all.  He wants everything open around Easter!  Maybe he hasn't been paying attention to the medical professionals, the scientists or the governors - or even other countries.  But always thinks he knows best of course.  Experts be Damned!! Someone with no governing experience, no scientific experience and no common sense - knows better than anyone else! I will continue to listen to the medical professionals and the scientists (like all responsible normal adults should do) - and let the \"stable genius\" in our White House be proved wrong!  Unfortunately proving him wrong involves hurting others, but there is no way around it if he follows through on his mis-guided path.So what am I actually doing with all my time?Right now baby sitting my grand daughter.  Day care is closed and my kids are working from home - which is impossible if a 2 year old is about!  I am thrilled to have this time with her.  But my child care juggling skills are little rusty.  The latest example of my short comings involves potty training.  Not mine but hers!! She is almost potty trained and gets it right most of the time but when she is deep in thought it becomes chancy.  Suddenly she raced to the toilette yelling \"potty, potty, potty.\"  I, of course, race after her, saying \"hold it, hold it, hold it.\"  Ha!  Neither of us is consistently good at this.  She was very wet by the time she reached the toilette, so I lifted onto the seat and left for a moment to get some dry panties, pants and socks (very wet).  Sincerely, I wasn't gone long.  And when I returned she had unrolled a whole roll of toilet paper onto the floor - with a BIG smile on her face - a \"loving life\" smile.  Yikes!  Now-a-days toilette paper is like gold, so I wrapped it back up - laughing at myself.Then there is Country House Gent presents Travel's By Narrow Boat! on Amazon Prime.I googled the description of this 7 season show:Back in early 2016 and with his 50th birthday around the corner, Kevin Shelley (AKA CountryHouseGent) could feel the longtime stresses and strains of his modern lifestyle beginning to have a very real and serious effect - both mentally and physically. So by early 2017 and with almost all of his worldly possessions now sold, he packed the remainder into his camper van and set off to purchase what would become his new home - a canal narrowboat called Aslan. Thus began an amazing journey, not just along the UK canal network but also in the body and mind of Kevin. Watch as, episode by episode, he slowly transforms from an overweight, red faced, eternally exhausted and unshaven figure of a man, into a leaner, tanned and rested unshaven figure of a man. Along the way, he'll visit many new and undiscovered (by him) places, as well as demonstrating a penchant for the occasional pork pie or bacon and egg sandwich.I LOVE THIS SHOW!!  I could actually see myself doing this!  How wonderful.  Very interesting, relaxing to watch, images of England I will never ever see on my own!  I love life style shows and this is one of the best.  So yes, there is more TV of the wider world - that has not Covid-19 virus in it.And I have been asked to fill a position on the Board of Directors of my community until more than \"10 people can gather together again\" and we can have an election.  Ha.  I have volunteered a bunch of time for them this past year ... so not much has changed when I took this position.  Still doing the same stuff.  But I feel committed to helping and making a difference in the place that I live!  This is how I do it.Other stuff such as knitting and weaving are mostly done in very small batches.  Maybe once day care opens again I will find more time for these hobbies.  Widen my narrow world a bit more!So that is it from my little 1375 square feet of space in the mid-Atlantic in the USA!How are things in your little piece of the planet?"},
{"title": "Real Life - that feels like fiction", "date": "Wednesday, March 18, 2020", "text": "It has been a week since the world turned upside down for me.  God knows, the whole world is reeling from the spread of this virus - we are ALL upside down now.Was it just last Thursday when I dithered about if I should go to a weekend Fiber Fair just hours from my house?  Spend some down time at the ocean.  Or maybe skip the fair but spend quality time only with the waves and the sand. How can it be that thought process was only one short week ago?I have binged watched all the coverage of this pandemic and now it feels like I should take a break.  My head is weary from all the bad news - and I just need to hit the 'pause' button.  But how do you do that when each and every day the pattern of our lives changes yet again - new cautions, new closures, new restrictions, new predictions (dire ones), crashing stock market, death numbers climbing - it would be irresponsible to turn away when you need to stay informed.  But, oh the weariness of it all.Today I realized exactly what this feels like.  I am a huge fan of end-of-the-world fiction.  You know, apocalypse stories, pandemics, survivalist fiction, zombies, Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) events that interrupt the societal norm ... stuff that never happens, but is so interesting to read. Except - pandemics do happen as it turns out and other stuff in that genre can also happen.  Ok, maybe not zombies, but real life right now feels more like fiction.  What I want to do is just close my Kindle book right now - and everything returns to normal - until I pick up the Kindle again.Can we just have a 24 hour 'pause,' please?Maybe if we politely took a vote and everyone raised their hands for a pausewe could get one.I am getting quite good at washing my hands, wiping down surfaces (inside and out) that I might touch with Clorox wipes, making sure I stay many feet away from others, and cancelling commitments for the next 8 weeks or so.  I am buying ahead like everyone else - maybe not enough to last months, but certainly if I buy one of something normally, today I bought two.  Two or three of almost everything.  Except the stores have gotten wise now - after they were totally cleaned out last weekend - and they mostly limit you to two of stuff!  My household foods and supplies are now at an all time high.  And I don't feel guilty about it at all.  What I hear (since I can't seem to stop listening) is that the next 5 to 7 days will see a dramatic rise in Covid-19 cases (despite the efforts that have been put in place to slow the spread.)  So if I don't have to go out to the store next week - that would be just fine.The first few days I was constantly reminding myself to do all the protective stuff.  It was exhausting to be so focused on everything single action.  But I discovered today that these cautions are becoming part of my normal way of behaving.  I never touch public surfaces now if I can help it - and when I do I whip out the hand sanitizer.  Yes, I have some of that golden liquid that everyone seeks - from last spring - when I got the flu.   And I have 3 boxes of disposable gloves spread around the condo - some in the pockets of my coats or in my purse.  I hope all this effort makes a difference.  I can't imagine going through an illness that can make me more ill than that flu did last spring.What I can't seem to wrap my mind around is that these practices probably will be part of our lives until a vaccine is available.  That is at least a year away.  We might get a break during the summer months, but this little bugger virus will be back.  We are talking at least a year or more of vigilance as our only protection!Is it possible to be that regimented in your personal practices to maintain that level of protection for so long?  I guess the answer must be a resounding YES!What we are really talking about is a permanent new reality!!Or, we are all living inside a novel - permanently trapped - with no way to escape!Am I just over reacting or do others feels this is a unreal world right now?"},
{"title": "Judging has no place in a viral pandemic!", "date": "Sunday, March 15, 2020", "text": "Have you experienced it yet?A subtle judgement because you choose self isolating behavior in this pandemic even if you aren't sick?I will say that the last few days have been devoted to getting informed, make decisions, changing plans and preparing!  In the \"changing plans\" arena, I have noticed there is an unexpected sea of opinions circling around every individual \"self isolation\" decision acted upon.No matter the subject, there can be a range of opinions all professing to be the \"right one\" - with little flexibility to admit that there may be no \"right\" decision for all - just a \"right\" decision for you.And so it has been with this Covid-19 virus. As the world experiences this virus intimately (at the personal social circle level) - it becomes evident very quickly that judgement plays a part.  Person A decides everyone is over reacting and goes on as before ... while Person B decides that if you aren't distancing yourself from others and changing your behavior you are irresponsible.  Judging, judging everywhere.Maybe an example describes this situation best. Suppose you have dinner plans with a large group of friends.  One or two decide to drop out due to the virus - and choose to avoid restaurants for awhile.  Pay attention to the comments of others who still plan to attend:\"Well, we can't stop living our lives.\"  Isn't that a kind of judgement upon the person who put caution (staying home) over persistence (going out)?  Wouldn't it be better to say ... \"Everyone must decide for themselves, of course.\"  \"Well I have been going out to restaurants for weeks with no problem.\"  Isn't that a kind of judgement ... one that really says, \"See, I am well and nothing has happened to me.  So it must be ok.\"    *sigh* - Oh ... if the contagion issues were just that simple.Or someone says absolutely nothing -  offers silence as a response.  After all - that doesn't seem judgmental, does it?  While total silence doesn't appear to be judgmental on the surface - it can be perceived as is a negative response.  Wouldn't someone normally respond \"Hey, we will miss you this time around.  But I understand if you need to do this.\"I am sure there are many little episodes similar to this one playing out in our nation right now.  After all, our illness and death rates do not yet look like China, Italy or even Europe.  So it is easy to wonder why this is such a big deal!!Another example of judgment is a statement like this: \"Well, you can recover.  Not every Covid-19 illness ends in death.\"  True.  Actually, most recover.  After seeing a comparison of flu symptoms and Covid-19 symptoms, I admit thinking, \"Gosh - no sore throat - my Flu swollen throat last spring landed me in the ER.  I needed steroids to get past that. No sore throat with Covid-19!  Ha!  I could nail this illness with no sweat!\"  Well - I have come to the conclusion that my narrow-minded, self-absorbed and selfish thinking self is all wrong.  It is not all about ME and my throat!  It is about US -  and US, folks, is a whole lot of people that could get sick (hospital level sick) at the same time.  The rate of serious reaction and death with Covid-19 is higher than the Flu.  We could break our health system if we didn't lower the speed and spread of infection through simple self isolation.  I also have re-thought that symptom list - shortness of breath?  Yikes!  I like breathing. When this new virus popped its ugly head in my awareness - back in January - I was one of those who kept saying ---\"Hey everyone, the flu kills.  It kills thousands every single year.  Fear the Flu!! This new little virus is just a blip!  What is the big deal?  There must be something they aren't telling us!  Ridiculous over-response to a blip!\"  Well, it is now March - and I have changed my tune.  And now when authorities (and science - let's not forget science) asks me to change my way of acting, responding, preparing - my way of living ... I listen!And here is a thought!  If we don't take all the appropriate and cautious actions recommended by authorities, do we really want to end up like Italy?Ok, I am off my soap box now.  I am heading to the kitchen to wash my hands again!  I am sanitizing surfaces because we are expecting company this afternoon and I will sanitize again after - I want to protect others as well as myself - even if they don't believe as I do.And no judgements!"},
{"title": "Indecision Resolved", "date": "Friday, March 13, 2020", "text": "So ... I did not go to the OC Delmara Fiber Fair - scheduled for this weekend.A lot can happen in 24 hours.  Wednesday afternoon I dithered about whether to attend a Fiber Fair about 2 1/2 hours drive from me.  I had it all planned out to attend.  I started packing.  I spent the previous 3 days getting organized so my absence from my husband was minimal.  I was ready with only one tiny little reservation - Covid-19 was heating up on the national and international stage.  But locally it was just a small blip.  I would go, arrive Friday morning (a work day for most) when they opened and stay a short time at this small fair. I went to sleep Wednesday night looking forward to the weekend.Thursday morning's news was concerning.Reports of imminent school closings were repeated on the news and from friends.  Hmmm... that may impact me.  I don't have any school age kids, but I am my grand-daughter's back-up for day care.  Day care establishments follow public schools in some announcements.  Right then I decided to go to the ocean but not attend the fair.  I could have 2 days of just me time: the ocean, my audio books and my knitting.  And I would minimize my own exposure to this virus so I could baby sit my grand daughter.Later Thursday I heard from my daughter - who is in a leadership role in a Continuing Care Retirement Community.  She asked if I could pick Milo up on my way home Sunday.  There was a chance she might be working long hours and she was worried about her dog.  Well, of course.  Fits perfectly into my schedule.Late Thursday afternoon our Governor held a news conference.  He announced sweeping changes - closing the schools for 2 weeks and canceling all gatherings of 250 or more people - for government, parades, religious institutions, entertainment venues and social gatherings.   He closed our ports, encouraged work from home and other measures designed to protect the citizens.  While the number of reported cases remained small compared to other areas, he was taking these steps to get out ahead of the expected increases - and maybe disrupt the contagion cycle by severely limiting gatherings.  I was proud of his actions.  Compared to our President's methods - our Governor looked like a knight in shining armor - ready to do battle.I still could go to the ocean since I didn't plan on attending the fair anyway.Then my daughter called again.  Her community was on lock down - meaning no visitors.  She wondered if I would be willing to return from my weekend early to get Milo if needed.  She was drafted into working the weekend with expected long hours ...  for all available staff - specifically staff without children - as they expected big absenteeism due to child care concerns from school closures.  And to complicate things, 2 members of her resident community were currently being tested for Covid-19.  Should any one test come back Positive, she would be quarantined a long with everyone else - and not allowed to leave for 2 weeks - not even for her dog.Within 24 hours - I went from:going away this weekend and attending the fair, to going but not attending the fair ... to, finally, not going at all.It was a crazy 24 hours.Today it is beautiful outside.  I am sure it is amazing at the ocean.  I am spending the day getting my grand dog (who I love and would hate to see caught up in any possible 'quarantine drama,' as well as relieving my daughter's mind) and unpacking my many bags of things I was taking to the ocean.After all is said and done - I am just a little bit disappointed.  Getting away would have been nice. But these are exceptional circumstances and require exceptional actions.  And I would never put anything ahead of my kids needs if I could help it.But ... here is a message to you, Covid-19.  Stay away!  I am washing my hands and disinfecting stuff, and buying ahead, staying out of crowds, practicing social distancing, and changing my personal schedule!  It would add insult to injury if I got this stupid virus now."},
{"title": "To go or not to go!  That is the question!", "date": "Wednesday, March 11, 2020", "text": "This stupid new virus has everyone tied up in knots.Stores have bare shelves where Disposable Vinyl Gloves, hand sanitizer and face masks used to be.  Ok, I get that!  Kind of a helpful barrier to ward off causal exposure to this new virus - that NO ONE has resistance to!  And then there is the bottled water and toilet paper shortage!  What is with that?  Someone please explain those two items to me - and why I should be hoarding them.  That reaction seems to be connected to extreme weather events - not illnesses!  Unless I am missing something ... that is just crazy behavior!And washing your hands!  Well, yes, we should have ALREADY been doing this because of the flu - which I think I am at greater risk of catching even with my flu shot from last October!But still the warnings about this virus are rampant and listening to them just makes good sense.  It is highly infectious with a higher mortality rate especially among folks my age.  So I listen and make some changes! I upped my hand washing.  I believe social distancing is a good idea.  I buy some appropriate items when they are available: a box of disposable gloves and some antibacterial soap.  I am pretty much set with hand sanitizer because of last spring's flu event! I always have an ample supply of Clorox wipes. I try (in vain) to keep from touching my face!  (Seriously, is anyone completely successful at that?) We always have too much food in the house (I am a food hoarder who hates to cook ... go figure!) So I think I am prepared should COVID-19 pop up in my local county - which it hasn't yet!  But who is to know - the thinking is that COVID-19 is already present in the population generally at lower levels and the only \"popping up\" that will be reported will be someone who gets really sick, is tested and maybe hospitalized.But here is the REAL dilemma.  Warnings abound about avoiding large crowds.  Events are being cancelled.  Schools are making arrangements for 'distance' learning in our area (despite the fact that there are only 20 confirmed cases in our state.  Flights are being cancelled because they are empty.And I have plans this weekend to attend an event. To go or not to go!  This weekend I have plans to go to Ocean City where the Delmara Wool and Fiber Fair is held.  This is a yearly event - small in nature - maybe 35 vendors.  I'll be driving (no public transportation) and I planned to attend the event on the first day - Friday - when attendance will be smallest as it is a work day for most.  In fact I am hoping to arrive as it opens.  In the past it is not a 'sardine event' like Maryland Sheep and Wool in May where people are shoulder to shoulder at times.  Social distancing should be easy to achieve at this March event. I so look forward to going to these kinds of Fairs - especially since they take the place of any real vacationing -  my husband won't travel any more. At present I intend to go as planned.  After all, COVID-19 will be with us probably now as a regular \"visitor\" like the flu into the future.  I can't lead a life that is always filled with avoidance until a vaccine is available!  My practical voice says that a few simple measures at a small event should be enough.  But then you turn on the TV or radio and the news seems a bit grim.  And my practical voice  changes its message saying - is it worth the risk?But ... oh, woe is me if this impacts Maryland Sheep and Wool in May!How are things in your small part of the world?  Are you spending any time'preparing,' fretting, assessing?"},

{"title": "Change or Crumble or ...", "date": "Sunday, March 1, 2020", "text": "My grand daughter turned two in February.  It was a fun and joyous event even if she was over-tired from staying up late at my house the night before.  (You do know ... at grandma's house the rules are pretty flexible - like bedtimes!)  Ha!  Her cute little self is pretty much as pure as the day she was born!  Too soon for any real negative 'foot prints' to change that little soul - because she lives in a happy loving home with two caring parents and extended family who loves her with a passion that I never knew as a child.Opening Birthday Gifts with her MomIt got me thinking about how 'life' changes you as you walk gingerly through it - stepping over or side stepping difficulties until they can no longer be avoided - and you have your very first negative 'foot print' on your child-like self.  It could be the addition of a sibling that divides your parents' attention from you.  Or an early form of bullying from a peer who is too young to know empathy or compassion. For myself it was at age 6 when an alcoholic father did something that forced my gentle mom to warn him away, or she would push the baby bottle she was using to feed my infant sister \"down his throat.\"  At age 72 I still remember that scene like it was yesterday.  I think that was the first foot print on my child-like self.  Other memories - less clear - followed over my childhood years - probably not retrievable as a self protective mechanism.  But early changes such as these made me more docile than my true nature probably.School years were a struggle as well.  I was not a good student - maybe not academically gifted or maybe just too impacted by a less than happy home.  My memories are jumbled but I remember making friends easy - certainly not part of the \"in crowd\" but not an outsider either.  Inviting friends into my home was infrequent and sleep overs never occurred because in an alcoholic home you couldn't be sure it would turn out well. Best to cover up that fact. In addition bullying is not limited to just this generation.  But I managed to side step those issues by being willing to mold my self to the will others.  I'd learn how to side step difficult personalities thanks to my father - it was just as easy to side step difficult peers the same way.  Many many foot prints were stamped on me in those years by my father and by my peers. I emerged my teen years as a person who was liked but not necessarily popular, content but not necessarily happy and eager to be independent without necessarily knowing what I would do with my life.  A middle of the road person who finds the 'middle' less foot stomp worthy.When I married I managed to side-step repeating history - no heavy drinking spouse for me.  Chronic drinking would be a 'deal breaker.'  And, to this day, it would still be a deal breaker - even after 50 years of marriage.  I guess that was the first time in my life that I ever put my opinion and my desires ahead of others. But marriage at 22 years of age is a \"crap shoot.\"  The person you are at 22 (in many ways not fully formed) may not resemble who you are at 72!  So it was for me.  Lots and lots of foot steps trampling  me forcing me to Change or Crumble.  I chose Change.  And change made me harder.  Those 50 years were filled with the highs and lows of children of my own, professional challenges, and heart breaking elder caregiving for 3 family members.  I learned step by step, that I couldn't be all things to all people.  I learned that I was a limited resource and if I wanted anything of me left of me for me - I needed to draw lines in the sand in each and every relationship.  Boundaries were my survival mechanism.  Even with my own children - for whom I would give my life - alcoholism would not be tolerated.  Thankfully - that illness has not found its way into their lives.Even my spouse - has planted footprints on me that has changed who we are together.  Small little red flags that waved gently in my face at 22 before marriage are still waving glaringly in my face at 72!  It is true that you should never assume you can change anything about anyone.  Those red flags have formed me.  After all ... it is Change or Crumble!  I don't Crumble!  Not in my nature.  I got tougher, more willing to stand up for myself, less willing to choose the middle ground.  And the changes in our married relationship that those constant red flags have forced ... have changed the nature of our married life.  I have often commented that I am not the person he married 50 years ago. If I was, he may not have married such a firmly formed me at 22.  He, however, is very much the same person I married all those years ago. So I guess there is a third response to life - Change, Crumble or Static!Wrestling with her dad!  I think she is winning!My grand daughter - how I wish I could protect her from all those negative kicks in life that change who you are.  Or maybe I should just wish that the changes in her life will all be positive ones... ones that make her a better human being as she grows.  Strong, compassionate, smart, brave.  Shield her from those things that make her hard, selfish, cynical and judgemental.Reading a book with her Aunt.Or maybe I should just be grateful that she has the strong foundation of 2 loving parents and close loving extended family - and with those few vital building blocks she will be able to weather all the footprints that want to stamp her out - she won't need to Change, or Crumble or be Static.She will ... Flourish!"},
{"title": "My Alien Knee and My Aries Body", "date": "Friday, February 21, 2020", "text": "There are just some things that you have to accept about an aging body - things that can't be fixed by modern medicine or exercise or ... even magic I would guess.  And I hate these little \"reminders\" that parts of me are not working like they once did.I should preface my post with the reality that my health generally is pretty good - my limitations are minimal and my mental abilities have not yet begun to decline.  Maintaining my mind is a major consideration when dementia runs in my family.  So I am blessed, blessed, blessed - over and over and over again to this point in life.And, yet, I find little resentments creeping up because of a left knee problem that has dragged on for more than 8 years.  It's a nuisance really.  A torn meniscus that has had a surgical repair and a total of 4 long sessions of physical therapy, not to mention all the money spent on hot and cold packs, wraps and over the counter medications to support and sometimes mask the off-and-on symptoms over the years.  I was cautioned by a Ortho doc years ago that you might repair a torn meniscus, but it can tear again and again. Well heck, there should be a 'recall notice' or something on such a weak piece of equipment. It is silly for me to go on so, when I have friends and family who have had full knee replacements, debilitating arthritis, cancer treatments, and/or died early because of serious illness. It is embarrassing to admit that I have just this little nuisance issue and I can't seem to accept that.So why is it I have so little patience with this little (sometimes big) knee.  I thought long and hard about this - my resistance to even one little medical limitation that can't seem to be fixed by anything medicine has to offer or by my own force of will. My daughter would suggest that it is because I am an \"Aries.\"  Sincerely, I place no validity in this astrologic stuff.  It is fun to read and try to compare it to personalities that you know, but is it true?  I just can't buy it.  And when I told my daughter that, her response ... \"Oh mom, that is such an Aries answer.\"  Haha!!So I looked up my sign on the internet for this post and found this stuff.*****Strengths: Courageous, determined, confident, enthusiastic, optimistic, honest, passionateWeaknesses: Impatient, moody, short-tempered, impulsive, aggressiveAries likes: Comfortable clothes, taking on leadership roles, physical challenges, individual sportsAries dislikes: Inactivity, delays, work that does not use one's talentsAs the first sign in the zodiac, the presence of Aries always marks the beginning of something energetic and turbulent. They are continuously looking for dynamic, speed and competition, always being the first in everything - from work to social gatherings. It belongs to the element of Fire.  Aries is one of the most active zodiac signs. It is in their nature to take action, sometimes before they think about it well.*****So ... crap!  That pretty much is me.   Ok, to be brutally \"honest\" (one of my qualities), that statement is ALL me!!  What to do ... what to do...I have come to the passionate conclusion (a strength) that my left knee must belong to another sign!  Yes, that is it.  All of me is Aries except this stupid left knee and I am going to have to beat it into submission.  And I will do so by continuing my leg exercises (which I hate doing by the way ... but no matter).  My left knee is surrounded by Aries muscles and tendons.  I will aggressively (a failing) continue those exercises because there is a physical challenge (a strength) there. I need to resist inactivity (a dislike) and remain determined (a strength) to make this knee fit into my of my body - a body that is Aries 'proud.'I still don't believe in that Zodiac stuff!  But if I have to be like any of those signs - I would have chosen Aries.  Ha.  I don't believe, I don't believe, I don't believe.

{"title": "Finally Grown Up", "date": "Thursday, February 13, 2020", "text": "It had to happen sometime. I am finally a responsible mature adult!  Glad it happened at the grand old age of 72.  I would hate to have gone through my whole life and never reached that state.It took a Flu bug back in April 2019 to force this evolution upon me.  It was that illness that made me realize I wasn't made of steel - that a little tiny virus, randomly planted in my system, irresponsibly ignored and in the end, allowed to spread to its full potential in me, and then in my husband, and in who knows how many others when I was acting like I was indestructible ... that tiny virus could be very very distructive.  I was sent to the ER by a local minute clinic because my throat was so bad - and my eyes were blood red - that they feared I would have a respiratory obstruction if left untreated!  Of course, that immature person who is actually made of clay had to sleep with cold packs on her throat for TWO WHOLE NIGHTS before she thought of seeking help from that minute clinic.  Too stupid rather than immature ...  was the real problem.And I can hear the question - did you get your flu shot last year?  Yes, I did.  The flu that I got was not part of the flu shot cocktail for season 2018-2019!  But as my daughter-in-law said (she has a doctorate in Biology and works in the Bio-tech industry) - the flu shot didn't protect me from Type A flu - but it did reduce the severity of my illness.  God help me if I hadn't had that flu shot.)This winter season I have carried this newly matured me to the opposite end of the pendulum.  I went from \"Oh well, oh hum, I am sick. No problem. Keep on going\" ... to  ...\"Listen up Stupid.  This is a warning shot over your bough.  It can be something serious if you ignore it.\" It started with a runny nose and a killer sore throat on Monday morning.  My April 2019 flu began exactly the same way.  Out came the thermometer!  It wasn't working. So bought a new and improved one right away.  One of flu's hallmark symptoms is fever.  I began checking my temperature.  Was checking it every 30 minutes too much?  haha!  I looked in the mirror at my new adult self and said yes.  So I checked it every 60 minutes on Monday. (Probably still too much but I wasn't going to miss that 48 hour window when an anti-viral medication would give the best fighting chance of beating a flu bug.)  Twenty-four hours later - still no fever.  (And no, I didn't get up every hour over night to check my temperature.  I did think about setting an alarm, however.  Ha!! After another conversation with my reflected self in the mirror decided it would be counterproductive.)I have the very best conversations with myself! Probably not mentally normal, but that is for another post. 😊I did other things too.  I didn't take any cold or pain meds in the first 24 hours.  I wanted to watch that little bug's progression in real time through my body rather than trying to judge what was going on through a mask of medications.  That was a big change for me.  I really believe in medicinal fixes if there is a fix!  I love living in the 21st century when modern medicine can help reduce or cure many problems.  But I held off to let the possibility of a fever show its face.  I also pushed lots of ice water ... and, of course, I had my medicinal chocolate milk shake.  That felt so good on my painful throat.  If you are unsure what a medicinal chocolate milk shake is - check out this post. Then I started canceling all my commitments for the next 2 or 3 days until I could figure out exactly what I was dealing with.  I was not going to spread this around even if it was just a cold on family and friends or even total strangers.  How's that for mature!!Finally, and most importantly, I rested and rested and rested.  I actually listened to my body that said\"Stop moving, for God's Sake. I am sending you the 'fatigue' signal. You know fatigue is another flu symptom.I can't get you well AND keep on going like I have done in the past.\"  That was probably the BIGGEST change of all.  The former steel-made me would have just kept going, and going, and going!!  After all - not giving in has always worked for me - until it didn't in April 2019.  But in the past I was never 72!  I didn't have a body that was 'less' due to age. So the outcome??  As of this writing four days outmy throat is still somewhat sore but improving,my nose is still a little runny but improvingand no fever!My energy is returning. This is not the Flu!Hahaha!  How is that for a blow-by-blow of a simple cold!I am treating this episode as a 'dress rehearsal' so when the real thing comes along - I am ready!  And the real thing can be darn scary.  As I was writing this post I had the radio on.  They reported that a 16 year old in my area had just died from the flu.  That 16 year old had been seen in the emergency room on a Sunday and died at home on a Wednesday.  Sixteen years old - folks - with a normal immune system, and bursting with health and youth, just her lost the battle against a small flu virus!  I am finally grown up - better late than never.    Listen to your body and take care of yourself!It is a war out there and some of us are losing!Get your flu shot!  It is never too late.Medical Disclaimer:This post is not meant to be medical advice.  Check with your doctor to see if the flu shot is right for you!  But ME is telling you:Checking with your doctor is just the right and mature thing to do.  Don't assume you are made of steel.  No one is - not even if you are only 16 years old."},
{"title": "Rescue Buttons", "date": "Monday, February 10, 2020", "text": "Yes, Rescue Buttons!It took me awhile to find a child's sweater for my niece's baby due in March.  Searching took a lot of time.  I finally settled on Wee Envelope by Ysolda Teague.  It looked simple to do and speed to the finish line was an important consideration.  Then I hunted for the right yarn.  I hunted only in my stash because I just have so darn much!!  I like acrylic for small children's items.  I know the knitting community favors wool even for children ... but the reality is that working mothers already have their hands very full.  Acrylic is wash and dry.  Easy peasy!!  And Caron Simply Soft has a very nice acrylic and I have a bunch in various colors.  So I hunted and nothing seemed quite right ... until I saw this multicolor in shades of rose.  The yarn is called Ambre and the color is called Rosewood!  I bought this yarn probably 10 years ago on deep discount so it was deep deep stash yarn.  I love the colors.This yarn never found a project because although I love Caron Simply Soft and I love this color called Rosewood - the long runs of color seemed to be a challenge.  The sweater had to be simple enough to not detract from the color changes but not so simple as to be completely boring.So I took a chance - with a short turn around time for finishing - and began the sweater in Rosewood. As I worked on it - I ran \"hot\" and \"cold\" on if it was turning out ok.  The sweater was worked from one cuff to the other cuff - and the body picked up at the bottom of the yoke and knitted down to the hem.  It had an interesting yoke construction.  And the designer had 'picture support' on her web site to help those who didn't understand the written directions for the yoke.  I was one of those who needed help.But the big challenge were the colors and the way they switched.  I was worried that it was too busy, too much emphasis on the colors ... just too much of everything.  I stopped working on it several times.  I considered ripping it out and starting over in a solid color.  Something safer, where the pattern gets a chance to shine.Then I decided to complete the sweater and give it to charity.  I would buy a gift for this new baby. To finish it I needed buttons.  The buttons I finally settled on I overlooked at first.  They weren't striking as they sat on a white card.  At some point I found these - but I kept looking.  I wasn't exactly what I wanted but it was something.  I took them to a bright light in the sewing section - and put them against the sweater. It was magic!!The color in the buttons seemed to pick up the colors of the sweater as you moved them.  They are sort of pearly so as you move the sweater, the button colors seem to slide between the dark and swirly colors in the sweater.  It is hard to catch that in still photography.  But take it from me ... they are perfect. For a busy sweater with busy buttons,  it seemed to work.  I sewed them on before I finished the body.  Glad I did.  The more I worked with the sweater ... the more I loved it.  One of my knitting friends suggested that I get baby jeans to go with it.  Brilliant!!All that self doubt, and starts and stops, all gone.  Because of buttons.They are \"Rescue Buttons.\"And, yes, the sweater is going to my niece's baby girl!!  Now I need to go get jeans for her!!"},
{"title": "Wallace", "date": "Saturday, January 25, 2020", "text": "I don't post much about the animals in my life.  Not sure why that is.There are some wonderful pet soul mates in my past andpresent.But these past 6 months definitely belong to my cat Wallace, Wally for short.Max Left, Wally RightAt 13 years of age we consider ourselves luck to have had Wally that long.  He started out life with his brother, Max - Maximillan. We adopted them together, wanting a bonded pair.  After years and years of 4 previous cats at odds with each other, we wanted the next set to be peaceful.I think these boys are the best looking of all our cats over 50 years.  The first two weeks we had them, we spent $2,000 to get them healthy.  Shelter cats typically come with various problems and we were committed to giving them a fair shot at life. Wally was underweight and ill due to lack of nutrition. During that time I had to force feed him.  His brother Max was 'the dude' in charge - he ate first and didn't care who else was hungry.  Max was a sweetheart, but food was his God!  Wally was docile and waited his turn to eat!  Once we got this pair in our home and discovered the situation, food was abundant for both.  But old habits die hard and Wally continued to defer to his brother.MaxFor 3 years things were great.  Wally was always \"second banana\" to his brother, but we kept tabs on that relationship and no one ever suffered.  But at 3 years of age, Max was diagnosed with degenerative kidneys - a common condition for cats, but way too early in his young life.  Between prescription food ($$$$) and subcutaneous fluids (injected under the skin of his ruff) every other day ($$$$) we kept Max alive for another 8 years.  He died at 11 years of age from kidney failure - finally.  But for such a long life, he should be in the Records Book somewhere!  When vets hear Max's story they are astonished.  \"Unheard of\" ... is the frequent comment.WallySo that is the back-story of the two brothers.Now we were down to 1 cat - Wally.  Initially we worried that he would pine for his brother.  Nope!! No pining here!!  In fact he actually flourished.  He was no longer the second banana.  Wally was loving and happy now that he was the star of this household!!In August of 2019 - 4 years later - when it was discovered that he was hyperthyroid - another common condition for cats.  Over the course of the last 6 months we struggled with medication at various strengths and appetite problems.  We tried a large range of prescription foods and grocery store food.  All efforts cost many dollars.  But this guy is family so we plowed on as we did for his brother. Getting food into him was the greatest challenge.  I had visions of my force feeding sessions with him as a kitten. Finally his eating trickled down to almost nothing.  Was it his thyroid meds or was it is teeth.  We moved forward with the dental and they discovered the probable cause of his loss of appetite.  His teeth were a mess.  After the cleaning, we took him to a recommended Vet dentist - where we were told his poor gums and teeth were not the result of improper care - but a condition called Tooth Resorption.  His body was \"reabsorbing\" his teeth - breaking them down right to and into the root.  When cats in the wild get this condition they starve to death because they cannot eat.  It is an internal process separate from regular tooth care.  And he was in a lot of pain as you can imagine.  But, typical of cats, he never showed that.  Just couldn't eat.  Not showing pain or illness is a survival technique for cats in the wild - they don't want to become prey!  Cats are only partially domesticated and predators by nature, so it all fits together.WallyThe total visit with exam, X-rays, surgery costs, recovery costs, extraction of 8 molars, injectable meds for pain and antibiotics ... (drum roll ... ) was close to $1900.  Did we wince at that cost??  Absolutely not.  He is now comfortable - eating soft foods - and returning to good health.  We hope to have him for many more years.  He is a fabulous cat and we love him dearly.WallyNon-pet folks I find don't understand our willingness to do whatever we can for our pets.  My response is that pets are family.  If you look into those eyes, how can you not see a beautiful 'soul' staring back at you? Pets 'give' more than they 'take.'  And if good health and a quality life after treatment is possible - I will do it no matter the cost.  If they are in pain and treatment will not fix the cause - like with cancer - we painfully and sorrowfully say goodbye to them, release them from their pain, and give them back to God.  We have done that 9 times and it never gets easy!  But for now this beautiful creature belongs to me.  He hopefully has many more years ahead of him.  Now that he has those pesky teeth out of his mouth, he can enjoy living again.My husband and I have lived with one or more cats our 50 years of marriage.  I think life would be less without one of these graceful and independent animals!Rest on my dear Wallace.  You have earned your place in our home and hearts."},
{"title": "Apologies to my children", "date": "Tuesday, January 21, 2020", "text": "Have you ever felt like a deficiency in your personality is beyond your ability to fix?Do you struggle with a \"just nuts\" personal behavior and you fear it will be part of your life until you draw your last breath?  To make matters worse, could this unwanted 'whatever' behavior be a burden to your family after you die.  And because you can't seem to change that 'whatever,' all you are left with is an apology?!?Think on it!  I'll give you a moment.  What would you apologize for after you are dead?It can't be the typical stuff like losing weight, exercising more or leading a healthier life, because that lack of self control only impacts you - and not those left behind after death!  Deficiencies in kindness, consideration, generosity, gratitude or love don't count either ... because, again, after your death, it doesn't impact anyone else.  In fact, if your are a selfish, insensitive clod in life, others might be glad when you are gone.  Ha! But give it some thought. Still no ideas?Here is a hint!You come into this life with absolutely nothing and you leave it exactly the same way.I have told this story before but its worth repeating.  My Uncle died suddenly in his 90s. He died within a month of my mom's death. My cousin (his son) called me to offer condolences and to share a family story or two.  One story that made a BIG impression was the positive 'gift' he left for his children after death.  In settling his estate, his children entered his house to prepare it for sale. They discovered a house almost totally devoid of everything, except the actual items he needed for living.   Closets and cabinets were bare, counter and furniture tops were clear ...  the basics of living were all that was left.  Simplicity in its purest form.Now why do I go through this elaborate exercise to only end up with an apology?I don't believe my children follow my blog.  They may never receive this apology in the present.  But after I die and they are summing up all the little details of my life, (which I intend to leave as neat and tidy as my Uncle's house,)  they may come across this blog.  They may read the title - Apologies to My Children.  They might read and understand that I wasn't totally insensitive in the burden I left behind for them.You see, despite all my other good intentions, there will be this mountain of yarn that will greet my children when they come into my condo.  Beautiful colors and wonderful fibers and luscious to the touch ...  all just waiting for someone who knits to pick them up and ease them into a perfect project.  *sigh*.  It pains me to know that much of my yarn will 'out live' me ... still waiting in their turn in balls and cakes and skeins ... patiently waiting and waiting.I have long since accepted that I can't fix this yarn hoarding problem.  Yes, I downsized yarn, books and knitting tools when we moved. Prior to that I did a massive inventory of exactly how much yarn I had.  That was an eye opening and embarrassing experience.  It did slow the flow of yarn into the house.  I even revised that inventory a second time - only to discover that despite my best efforts, I couldn't knit faster than I could buy yarn.  But still I struggled manage this.  I deleted yarn vendor emails.  I stopped buying knitting books.  I didn't visit local yarn shops.  I only shopped for knitting patterns that would work for yarn already in my stash!!But there were some exceptions to this 'yarn fasting.'   I did go to Yarn Fairs during the year - only 2 fairs and yarn was purchased there in very modest amounts (read: normal amounts for normal people.)  And when babies joined our family, cashmere, merino and silk just didn't seem quite right for children's clothes.  So acrylic yarns were added to my stash.  I also added a small amount of fat yarn to my stash - I needed a palette cleansing after almost a year of skinny yarns.  And in my defense, the acrylic and fat yarn did get used.But then this month I saw this pattern.Nuallan Cape by Jen PierceKnit PicksDarn!!  I bought the pattern only - 'cause I love it.   I was sure I had something in my stash that this cape would work well in.   I didn't!!  Double Darn! So I went out to Knit Picks just to look at the yarn they used.  Knit Picks yarn is very reasonably priced, but I would need 2200 yards of it for my size.  That's a lot of yarn.  I hesitated.  I set the pattern aside.  I tried to forget about it for now.  I talked myself out of purchasing the yarn.  Focus, focus, focus.  You have enough yarn! Then Knit Picks ran a 10% off sale on that very reasonably priced yarn - with free shipping. Done!The yarn is sitting my condo ... waiting and waiting!  *sigh*.So ... to my children!!  I am very sorry that when I die you will have to plow your way through so much yarn at my death.  I will leave detailed instructions on how to proceed with clearing out this stash and getting it to good homes with loving knitters.  You might consider burying some of the better choice yarns with me and some knitting needles - just in case there is no yarn in heaven.So sorry, so sorry. In an effort to redeem myself, I will work on my list of project for 2020.  I will do my best to avoid these impulse purchases.  But I won't go into any 12-step program to fix this problem.  I just don't wanna!!  I will apologize over and over again - probably until the day I die.  And I will keep knitting.Dear children.  So sorry.  Love, your mom!"},
{"title": "The Quiet Month", "date": "Saturday, January 11, 2020", "text": "Finally I have reached the best month of the year that I earned by surviving the previous two months.  The Quiet Month ... January!I love everything about January.I love the absence of holidays, the routine of each day, and peaceful weather that has done all its contortions to change the seasons. Settling into the placid pace of winter is the reward.  Even when there is a snow storm - it usually approaches quietly no matter how intense it becomes. And a snow event leaves behind a beautifully clean white blanket ... hiding many of the ugly signs that man has passed this way.Even my frantic decluttering mojo that struggled to make space around me has passed, as I knew it would.  It will return, but for now it is hibernating. The whole of January is like a pause that allows time for rest and recharge.  No distractions from the chilly outside world or demanding holidays.For me - January is month made more special because of the full display of all the seasons in my area.  How fortunate I am to live where the four season equally share the spot light.  Folks who crave heat and love living in more southern climates miss out on some of nature's best displays of energy and wonder.  How sad it would be to never enjoy Fall's breathtaking colors, Spring's budding and waking, and only have Summer's showy lush greening and growing day after day after day.  And those that live in areas where Winter is King and night never seems to end also miss out on some of the qualities that Summer contributes.   Without all those experiences, January might lose some of it luster for me.  Because of the seasons, January makes its own quiet statement.As interesting and celebratory and visually stunning as those other seasons are ... I always look forward to the rest and recharge month.Let's hear it for the Quiet Month!!January."},
{"title": "Connections and Mojo", "date": "Saturday, January 4, 2020", "text": "The restraints are off!!  No Goals or No Resolutions or No Guidelines or No Anything that speaks of a yearly intention.  BUT I have plowed ahead regardless - one connected link at a time in \"making space\"  just like I always seem to do every single January.And yes,all the actions were curiously linked.It started with a walk-in closet.  This closet holds 'stuff' - paint, rags, wrapping paper, Christmas decorations, cleaning supplies, tools ... it is a catch-all closet.  When the door is closed - it is OK.  When the door is open - it is not.  When I decorated for Christmas I had to practically empty the closet to get to the right boxes.  Same struggle when I needed wrapping paper.  Ugly!  God forbid I should need a hammer or a nail.  When Christmas stuff returned to storage - I did a big clean out.  Now I can walk into the closet.  Fancy that!  I can actually walk into a walk-in closet!! The closet clean-out produced two bags of donations.  My first thought - two bags - not enough to make the trip to Good Will, so I easily created a few more bags from my \"guest/yarn/book/hobby room.\" BUT ... while tootling around in the \"guest/yarn/book/hobby room\" for donations ... I remembered a problem that needed my attention.  My knitting notions and needles were in total disarray after 9 months of marathon Christmas knitting.  The disarray was so bad I was forced to buy several circular knitting needles in sizes that I already owned but could not find.  *sigh*  Now I have an organized knitting notions bag - an actual tote size bag.  (Yes, I have a knitting notions problem.)   And finally, all the knitting needles are back in their 'homes' ready for the next project. And speaking of the 'next project,' after wandering around in my knitting supplies, I pulled out all the knitting projects that I set aside to get Christmas projects completed.  Yep!  I did a little line up of things that needed finishing.Finally I was done.  'Stop looking at stuff' I cautioned myself.  It never ends.  Best to do something that really need doing ... like bill paying.Ha!  I am so naive. I set myself to working on bills.  Of course, my wandering eyes drifted towards the 5 inches of filing that I put off for months.  At the same time,  I remembered that I needed to find a specific proof of warrantee that my previous searches didn't turn up.   Filing followed bill paying.  And a search for a specific paper followed filing.Filing done!  Warrantee info found. Since I am not a fan of filing, I decided to distract myself with a cup of hot tea. (Seriously, a cup of tea ... where could that lead, right?) See, I am a coffee drinker, but for some reason I have boxes and boxes of different kinds of tea.  And much of it never gets consumed because most teas upset my reflux.  (Bet you know where this is going ... ). So with a ton of tea taking up space - most of which I cannot drink - I decided to thin it out.  I made several cups of tea to taste, and I pitched near 100 tea bags in the trash.  I still have a life time supply of tea, but it felt good to get rid of the stuff I couldn't swallow.NOW I am done!!(Does anyone believe that?)My knitting activities will probably lead to a much needed reduction in knitting patterns and books.  My tea tasting adventures will definitely lead to a much needed clean out of my messy pantry.  Who knows where this 'clean out fever' will connect to next.January always seems to trigger this fever in me.  List or no list - ironically downsizing and cleaning out usually makes an appearance in my New Year.   This year it popped up spontaneously without a set of New Year goals.  It felt wonderful to just do what was in front of me rather than what was on goals list.   All that was needed was the mojo to do it!But here is the really satisfying thing. If the mojo goes away - oh well.  I got a lot done while it was here.  It will return.  It always does! Meanwhile  \"Clean Out January\" - a very satisfying thing to do!!  A lovely way to begin the New Year!"},

This year I have a **New**  Grand Master Plan for 2020.  It is a brilliant and daring idea - and a 'first' for me!!  Potentially life changing and yet simple.  It belongs on a magazine cover!!  Drum Roll, please.

I am pretty sure that doesn't mean the death of daily to-do list, or weekly menu planning, or shopping lists, or weekly calendar management.  I am all for breaking out of my rigid mold a boldly following a new direction, but a 72 year old brain still needs some structure after all.  To me it means I have no overlying goals or \"special words\" or New Year's resolutions or lists of major projects ... to achieve for the next year.  None!!Summed up in a single sentence:I am not layering on top of my everyday lifeany more expectations than I currently have to get through each day. (I wonder if I should write a book about that.) 😆While I glory in the newly minted feeling of freedom that planning nothing for the new year provides, I have a sneaky suspicion that some people have approached the New Year with this attitude for a long time.  For me, however, it is ground breaking.  It might even be another level of maturity or increased confidence!  Maybe just a new way to live my life.Me ... without a plan! 👀😧😳👀 Will anyone recognize me?Since I am not breaking out in a sweat or trembling or hyperventilating ... it must be the right course of action for me!

{"title": "Christmas and the finished objects pictures ...", "date": "Thursday, December 26, 2019", "text": "I have finally ... (this is the most recently 'finally' ... )sworn off knitting Christmas gifts.  This year was a busy year for planned knitted Christmas gifts.  I knew I had to start early.  Is April early enough?  I knew I had to remain focused on the goal.  I did.  And I knew I must not knit right up to Christmas Eve ...  early December was a good deadline!  Why?  Because knitting Gods are quirky and can place obstacles in your way to finishing on time.The last time I had such a heavy knitted gift list was 2003.  I planned 8 projects.  EIGHT!!  I started in October!  OCTOBER!!  For the non-knitting readers out there, that is insane!  Who does that??? But I made my deadline in 2003.  How?  The knitting Gods stepped in - this time with 'help.'  In early December my gallbladder blew up putting me in the ER - followed by a surgery, and 3 weeks off from work with the instructions to lift nothing heavier than knitting needles.  Done!!  I had to give up a body organ, but I made my deadline.  That year I swore off Christmas knitting forever.  I only have so many disposable organs!!Forever came and went however ... and here we are in 2019!I didn't plan 8 projects this year - only 3.  A dress and sweater set for my grand daughter and a sweater for my grand nephew.  A reasonable number in 9 months.  What I didn't plan for was how much knitting thin yarns and small needles really is or how time consuming (and thumb injuring) some fancy knitting stitches are to old thumbs.Grand daughter's dress and sweater (Projects 1 and 2)I am very pleased with how cute this set turned out.  Items knitted in fine yarns (fingering weight) with small needles have a wonderful finished look and drape.  Of course, I moaned and fussed about how long it took.  I probably won't go that thin with yarn again for a child's garment - it takes too long, they grow so fast and the use of the item is limited.  But it was an effort of love for a child who holds my heart in her tiny hands.  I'll knit fine yarn items for her again one day when she is older and her growth isn't so dramatic.Grand nephew's sweater (Project 3)It took me a long time window shopping through Ravelry to find this sweater pattern.  I loved it the moment I saw it.  While this yarn was thicker (sport weight,) the stitch creation was slower and it just about robbed my thumbs of fixability.  The basket weave stitch in the body is interesting with a density that speaks of jacket weight verses sweater weight.   But I was forced to switch to stockinette stitch for the sleeves - out of the desire to avoid injury.  When I purchased this uni-sex pattern, I planned to make one of these sweaters for my grand daughter too, but those plans went out the window quickly. Five cowls (Project 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8)I made 2 of the silver gray cowls.The thick yarn cowls were a knee-jerk reaction to so much thin yarn knitting.  The fat yarn captured my eye in Joann's weeks ago and I purchased enough for 2 cowls - one for my daughter and one for my daughter-in-law.  They turned out so well, I returned and got another color for me.  Fast, fast, fast.  One evening and one cowl is done.  I have seen others wearing cowls made of thick yarn so I suspect this is in vogue right now. The other two cowls were thinner yarns.  Larger cowl loop designs that are meant to wrap around the neck an additional time.  The red cowl was a Mobius design, but I twisted it an additional time so that the front of the stitch would remain outward.  Not sure it achieved what I was going for, but once wrapped around the neck, it is a non-issue.Son's hat (Project 9)My son has never requested anything knit.  He did ask me to crochet matching Viking helmets for him and his daughter which I did.  Esk has outgrown hers, and I need to make the next size up for her (January project), but I thought I would make a quickie hat for him.  After all, I had more than met my deadline.  And he shaves his head - so cold weather needs more than a ball cap.I finished his hat with 2 weeks to spare.  I briefly considered looking for one other project (crazy thinking).  Then I got sick and so did my husband.  The knitting Gods had stepped in and smack me across my head to bring me to my senses.If anyone is counting ... I knitted 9 projects - exactly one more than in 2003.  And I only meant to knit 3 projects.  I wasn't trying to break any records and I sure as h*ll didn't want to give up another organ ... so next year we are aiming for moderation and no deadlines.  That should keep the knitting Gods happy.Onward to 2020 and the freedom to knit whatever!PS - Looking for pictures of Christmas Eve??  There are none!  Can you believe it?  It was crazy bedlam here with 5 adults, an almost 2 year old and 3 dogs in our condo (two who do not get along and have to be gated separately!). But it was fun. Take it from me, next year I won't make this picture mistake again.  We are attending another extended family Christmas party on Saturday. It is at my sister's so the pressure is off me and I can focus on pictures.  Promise."},
{"title": "Begone December 2019", "date": "Sunday, December 22, 2019", "text": "That's right!I want December to be gone from my sight!Call me a Grinch!  If I remember correctly,he wasn't all bad.It has been a hard month health wise.  It started with a cold for me - minor, but still a bug that weaseled its way into my body.  I think I called it Cold Number 1 in my December 3rd post.  No sooner did it leave me, then my husband started with a GI bug that got into his body.  You know the kind ... nausea and other unmentionables better left unsaid.  But his GI bug was accompanied by a fever, and then losing consciousness, (a new twist on an old problem for me), and then a call to 911, and then a visit from the nice EMTs.  He recovered his consciousness and refused a hospital visit, but was sick with this bug for about 4 days total.During that time my daughter needed my assistance with transportation to a dental appointment that might have ended in conscious sedation for a procedure ... it didn't, thankfully.  Small blessings.  But no sooner did I return from that then my husband's bug jumped ship and decided I was a good candidate for further havoc.Nine ugly hours after it started with me - I finally began to feel human again. - no fainting and no fever, but me and my toilet .... well, we are 'buds' now, and my ribs still hurt 48 hours later from trying to empty my stomach that was already empty when I started.In between all that fun and frivolity I was busy making appointments for my husband for lab work, a CAT scan of his brain, a new patient appointment with a Neurologist and the EEG that doctor wants him to have, and a new patient appointment with a Cardiologist. Losing consciousness gets everyone's attention!Here we are on December 22 and my daughter calls.  She feels sick.  I am desperately hoping that while I was helping her with the dental appointment I wasn't also infecting her with whatever that GI bug that might have been hiding in me when we were together.Oh, and did I mention that my cat, Wally, was diagnosed with a hyperthyroid condition last month?  He stopped eating the prescription food for this condition this month, which had the condition under control, and he isn't been interested in taking the medication no matter how I disguise it.  Cats are so particular.  So we are at a stand off at present - but that is only for this month.  Untreated hyperthyroidism kills if not treated.  I may have to force feed that pill down his gullet to save his darn life!!And to add insult to injury, I am not a big fan of Christmas anyway - my dad died 2 days before the holiday and my mom died 3 days after the holiday. I struggle at this time of year.Probably the only thing that is keeping me from totally checking out of this whole terrible month - is my dear grand daughter, Eskarina.  She has reached the age where the wonder of the season puts a sparkle in her eye, and this grand mother would rather die than snuff out that light.  Those tiny little 20-month old shoulders shouldn't have to carry even an ounce of burden because of my bad luck.My husband's GI bug is gone but he thinks he is starting with a cold.  I am better from my GI bug.   With any luck Cold Number 2 will hit me around New Years.  My daughter is still an unknown as of this evening.  My daughter-in-law mentioned that Eskarina seems to be starting with a cold as well.  She awoke this morning saying, \"Buggers in nose.\"  (Buggers!!!  Who taught her the word 'buggers'??).  But day-care is just one big cold-virus factory, so the fact she has a cold is not too shocking!So everyone ....Happy Holidays!!(Aren't you glad you aren't anywhere near plague central?)PS - I promise to stop in again before the end of the year to provide pictures of my finished projects (shots are in the camera), and a few pictures of Christmas Eve with Eskarina.  And to provide proof that I participated 'joyfully and fully' in Christmas - despite everything!!"},
{"title": "A Journal Of A Different Type", "date": "Thursday, December 12, 2019", "text": "Weeks ago I became aware of a type of journaling that I never considered.Like a seed, it got planted in my brain and has bloomed into a new possibility.Years ago I wanted to keep a traditional journal.  You know ... the hand-written kind using paper and pen.  I think of it as an analog version of blogging - but a private one.  Five days into the process, however, I decided it was too cumbersome for me.  My brain did not engage with my pen well at all, and when it did, the first words would be not quite right, crossed out, erased, edited, ending in ... a mess.  I wanted to be neat and clean, but my writing is neither neat nor clean.  I deeply edit over and over until my brain narrows things down.  Blogging on an electronic platform allows all that massaging I need and is why it has been such a consistent practice for me - even if only episodic as of late. But recently I discovered a journaling method that won't leave my brain.  It is called 5 Year Journal.A 5 Year Journal typically presents as a normal diary that assigns each day of the week to a full page, but each page is divided into 5 equal sections - one section for each year.  As shown below - all the journal entries for January 1 are shown on one page.  The first year of this journal you are writing only in the top section.  Then when January 1 of the next year rolls around again, you return to the January 1 page once again drop down to the second section for your entry.  Obviously these are short sections - usually only 5 lines. It is just a short snap shot of what is on your mind on that day.  Brief, concise, specific entries.Doesn't sound like me at all, does it!!  Ha!In my research of these journals, I discovered that some versions offer a one sentence prompt per day.  I was intrigued by that idea as I don't feel my personal life is all that eventful or interesting.  Then I drifted into the possibility of only one word prompts - something to comment on as it relates to your life.  The choices of journals are beyond describing.  Some of the books are leather bound creations of great beautiful.  Some books' pages are stitched into the book while others can be refilled or switched out.  There are small books and large ones.  There are expensive and cheap ones.  Believe me - if you have problems with choices, don't Google a topic - it can be overwhelming.But still it attracted me.I tried to determine why this type of journaling was haunting my thoughts and why did I feel like I must begin one this January 1.  It was hard to put my reasoning into words - maybe a sign that I was attracted to the materials rather than the practice of a 5 year journal.  So I Googled \"Why keep a 5 year journal\" thinking maybe someone's words would capture my thoughts.  Hahaha.  Like Googling something EVER made anything more clear. NOT! So after much thought, here is what I have come up with from my own brain!If I looked back over my last 5 years - if I had started writing a 5 year journal in 2014 and I was writing in the 5th year of December 2019 section today - I could look back at all the Decembers - specifically I would see that in December 2014 I struggled with mom's last days, facing her death, struggling to do the right things for her.  I would find it interesting to see what my mind and heart were dealing with at that time 5 years ago - the things I felt important to put into words. Over the last 5 years other changes have happened as well.  Big ones.  We moved.  I became a grandmother!  I reconnected with a childhood friend.  I lost 2 dear friends.  I had knee surgery.  The list goes on.  My life was eventful in many ways.  I think as time passed, and I approached this book to post another entry, I would find interest and remembering of things that happened to me on those dates a year or more ago. I sort of wish I had that book today.But looking back is only half the story.  My next 5 years will also be filled with events - some sad and some joyful.  I think about the next decade or so - and at 72 it is a daunting thought.  My brain shies away from what the future might actually hold at this point.  Might it be a good idea to put pen to paper now in an abbreviated way to capture these last important years for myself?Why doesn't the online blog do this?  Well, for me, the blog is a public forum, but a written journal is a place where only I will visit - a private thing.  I seldom look back in my blog to past entries, but in a 5 year journal that snap shot entry would be evident every time I opened the book.  Is that important? I am not sure - but I wish I had the previous 5 years recorded in a useable way.I think if I were younger and had the expectation of many years ahead of me - I might not see a value in this kind of journaling.  But time passes by very very fast the older you get and sometimes the brain starts to stutter a bit.  Somehow putting pen to paper puts more stability and continuity into my daily living than launching a blog post into the great electric unknown of the web.  I will still blog because there is a social interaction in that type of journaling that is good for the soul.  But once the post drifts into the distant past ... it fades - no matter how important the topic was.  The 5 year journal seems to fill a different need.Will I still have problems putting pen to paper?  Probably.  I guess it is time to exercise a 'mental muscle' that hasn't been used since the 90's - 'from brain, to hand, to pen, to paper.'  It will be hard at first - but new skills are good for old folks like me.So I think I am going to start this for 2020 and hope it goes to 2025! The journal is ordered.  Leather covers, but mid-priced and refillable as opposed to pages stitched in place.  I might change my mind on that after I see the book in my hand.  I loved some of those leather imprinted covers.  I have opted for blank pages - knowing I can set up the dates and the years easily.  I might change my mind on that as well.  I may use one word prompts for each day of the year  - but who knows, I might ... you know, change my mind on that as well. :-)Have you kept a paper journal? Have you heard of 5 year journal?If so ...  how has traditional journaling worked for you?And why did you keep a journal?This 'journaling mind' wants to know!!"},
{"title": "Little Discoveries", "date": "Tuesday, December 10, 2019", "text": "You would think after 72 years on this earthI had these simple discoveries under my belt!#1 Medicinal Milk ShakesYes, there is such a thing!  While I was recovering from my first (and shortest ever) cold of the season, I made a wonderful discovery.  Medicinal Milk Shakes.  I am sure that any flavor would do but for me it was a Chocolate Milk Shake at my local Chick Fil-A drive thru.  I was on my way home from shopping for Christmas and decided to pick up some grilled chicken nuggets - no sauces or breading - just the grilled chicken nuggets.  Yum!  Waiting in line I decided to \"balance\" my healthy choice by adding a little treat. Small Chocolate Shake.  My head was stopped up tight and mouth breathing was what was left to me - so to reward my mouth for doing double duty with at milk shake! Photo credit - Chick Fil-ADiscovery - the cold of the milk shake against the roof of my mouth suddenly shrunk my sinuses cavities enough that I could breath normally!  Wonderful discovery - worked wonders.  Try it! You're welcome!  😋😋I am thinking of experimenting a little further ... using milkshakes to ward off head colds!  I believe that in a world filled with useless studies (just listen to the news most nights), this question has never been explored. I am willing to \"take one for the team.\"#2 Fatter is better!This discovery is a little more troublesome.  You would think after 20+ years of knitting, I would intimately understand the importance of gauge and needle size.  Apparently I felt after you passed size US10 knitting needles ... fat is fat no matter what the pattern says.The third color is a cream and not available for pictures as it is on the blocking board.I finished all the \"tiny-knitting-needles-and-skinny-yarns\" knitting for Christmas projects. While I was adding buttons, care labels, and sewing all the loose ends, I got the desire to \"go-fat.\"  (And this has nothing to do with the milk shakes, in case you were wondering.)  Weeks ago I picked up two skeins of Bernat Mega Bulky yarn in cream and silver gray at Joann's ...  I was drawn to the big stitches, the softness of the acrylic (they have really made great strides with acrylics) and the desire to have instant gratification project in my near future.  The 'near future' had arrived.Silver Gray and PlumColors are truer to the actual colors.This yarn is so thick the pattern calls for size US 19 knitting needles.  The largest size I had was US 15.  No matter ... 15 or 19 .... both are fat!  (Knitters and crocheters - I give you permission to cringe right about now!)  I charged into a one skein cowl pattern in this squishy soft wonderful yarn!  So fun!  And as expected I had a finished a cream colored cowl in a matter of a few hours.  Boy, I needed that!!  Start to finish in one sitting.  I tried it on!  Hmm ....  Seemed a little tight. Go figure!  Gauge counted!!  Ha!  A fatter needle was needed, I returned to Joanns to purchase more of the cream -  I would just add to the cowl till it fit better.  Of course, the cream was sold out.  I wanted 2 cowls for gifts so I decided to buy yet a third color (for me) and the (very important) US 19 knitting needles.This plum one is for me.What a difference it makes to use the right size needles!  The cowl fits as it is supposed to - with the right amount of ease and drape.  I decided to take the lazy man's way out on the cream cowl and try to block it a bit bigger.  The jury is still out on that effort.  Blocking acrylic usually is not suggested but since THIS acrylic is \"hand wash, lay flat to dry\" (unusual for acrylic), I am hopeful that blocking adds the needed positive ease.So lesson learned.  Fat is good.  Fatter is better!How I wish that was true in my body one other area of my life. 😏 #3  Learning from my experiences is not my strength!This fall while racing to complete my Christmas knitting projects, I fretted internally that I would not meet the deadline.  Retired to me means - a deadline is 'four letter word.'  Deadlines are meant for other people who live their lives by the clock - as I did for so many years.  I cursed my deadline setting.All that frantic knitting and worry meant that I was done earlier than I expected.  Hence the interest in knitting a cowl, then 3 cowls, and if that wasn't enough ... a man's hat!  This hat is for my son who wears his thinning hair military style - shaved close to the scalp.  He isn't one to wear a hand made sweater, but maybe a hat.  I can get that done before Christmas, right??The color is called Blueberry! And if I am reeeaaallly fast, I have enough yarn for a scarf ... before Christmas!!! *sigh* Some people just never learn from their own experiences!The yarn used is one of my all time favorites called Waterlily by Classic Elite Yarns, an extra fine merino wool made in Italy.  It was discontinued years ago, but before it left the market I stocked up and my sister stocked up.  Then my sister moved to mostly weaving.  She traded all her Waterlily to me for my most of my weaving yarns since I am not weaving - well .... not at the excellent level she weaves.  My Waterlily stash is now huge and making this hat has reminded me just how much I love this yarn.  It is soft, easy on the skin for wool and has a lovely bounce back when squeezed.  Stitch definition is perfect.  It boarders on an Aran weight, but can pass for Worsted Weight.  And it has subtle colorations - reminiscent of a kettle dyed yarn. Why this yarn was dropped from production baffles me!  In all my years of knitting, I have never found a yarn I loved more.😍😍My next post will be all the knitted projects I did for Christmas - before they are wrapped."},

I had breakfast and then decided to lay down for just a bit before getting dress.  I awoke at 12:30.  Yikes!  I got up, got dressed, had lunch and answered some email, and before you know it, it felt like nap time again!  Literally I was standing for about 15 minutes and sitting the rest of the time.  Another nap was ridiculous.  I cancelled today's activities.I did think b*tching about this cold was not ridiculous.  So here I am.  I cancelled tomorrow's activities.  Being pro-active.This minor cold counts officially as Cold #1 of the season.One down, four to go.  I think I will skip the flu this season. I wish I had thought of doing that last year!!My 2019-2020 goal: Skip the Flu."},
{"title": "Getting in under the wire!", "date": "Saturday, November 30, 2019", "text": "Here I am slipping off the November calendar into December without leaving a post!  I am fixing that right now.November has had its ups and downs.  It started out UP!  Going into November I was eager for the coming season.  Winter is just around the corner!  My favorite season.  But then it began to slip.It began with several sad announcements that always seem to come in threes: the death of a long time friend from cancer, the death of my mom's 94 year old Long Island friend who became my friend as well, and a second cancer diagnosis for another long time friend.  By the time we heard the third bit of bad news - I was ready to say \"uncle.\"  Please, please stop.  My husband made the observation ... now that the generation before us is gone, we and our peers are the next in line - and I should get used to it.  Sadly true.  My mom outlived most of her friends and it was sad to watch.  It does, however, put perspective on how I spend my own time - shedding things that really don't make a difference in life and putting more energy into family and friends.   Simplicity in life still remains a value for me.  But being there when it counts for those you care about is worth the complexity it adds.  The friend with a second cancer diagnosis is a single guy with little extended family.  His friends will be pitching in to drive him to his treatments.  I will be on that volunteer list. My physical therapy sessions continue but reduced to once a week.  Progress I guess.  The leg is now stronger.  Maybe too soon to expect the symptoms in my knee to be resolved.  But the exercises do make my leg feel better.  It is just frustrating to know that I will have to do these exercises (in both legs) for the rest of my life.  Falls for seniors are the #1 cause of hospitalization ... and in older seniors - #1 cause of death.  It was true for mom and it was true for her Long Island friend.  I have added a 5 pound weight routine for my arms to my regular exercise.  My grand baby is growing and gaining weight - although she is still a string bean - and I want to be sure I can continue to lift her.My Christmas Tree and Esk's chair with Santa Cat!Christmas preparation is well underway.  My daughter helped me put up my Christmas tree the weekend before Thanksgiving.  That is a record for me.  I actually dislike decorating the tree and put it off 'till I have no choice.  It is a small tree so there is no excuse for it.  And I do enjoy it while it is up.  Thank God for beautiful and helpful daughters.  Shopping is happening mostly on line so it is not too painful.  The next big goals are gift wrapping and party prep for a December 15 event at our condo for some friends - and finally, Christmas Eve prep for the family at our condo.  Christmas Day is usually a day of rest for me - but this year I will either be sitting in a chemo clinic with my friend or visiting my parents' grave site.  They both died within days of Christmas - so that is always part of my holiday.And .... Ta Da!!!!  Big announcement.  My grand daughter, Eskarina, finally calls me \"ga-ma\" ... her version of Grandma.  It is music to my ears.  In fact, we had a sleep over last night and I got to hear that over and over and over again.  Ha.  I would be standing in the kitchen and she would be coming from the living room chanting Ga-ma, Ga-ma, Ga-ma, Ga-ma, all the way into the kitchen.  I, of course, came to meet her half way - asking what she needs.  She smiled up at me and just said \"hi.\"  Its like she is making sure that this is the best word to get my attention!  It works and I love it!!  She went back home this afternoon and the house is like a morgue.  The quiet makes my ears ring!  She will be 2 in February ... the adventure is just starting!  Thank you God for giving me this grand baby!!Knitting is happening at a snails pace.  Oh, I am not knitting slowly.  I am knitting fast and a lot, but the projects I picked were designed for thin yarn and small needles.  What ever was I thinking.  I won't ever make that mistake again.  All the knitting is done - except for one sleeve which is 25% done.  Then I have to add buttons, sew in the loose ends and block.  I'll make it but I hate the pressure.  It takes just one unexpected \"something\" to throw everything out out wack! That pretty much sums up my life.  Hope all is well in your world.  I'll be back in December!!"},
{"title": "The Difference", "date": "Wednesday, October 23, 2019", "text": "(Looks like this will be my October post - now that I appear to have dropped back to only one post a month.)Time is passing at an almost incredible speed ...While I seem to be slowing down at about the same speed. I am more aware of time passing than at any other stage of my life.   In all other stages I was just too busy with other things like jobs, and kids, and hobbies, and travel, and caregiving, and whatever - to ever seriously recognize the speed of time.  Now a lot of those things are behind me and gosh ... why is it passing so fast!!At the same time it seems I am slowing down - naturally slowing in what I can physically accomplish, mentally juggle and emotionally handle.  In fact, although I still maintain a to-do list (a crutch for a brain that has a 30 second hold time), I generally don't feel obligated to spin my wheels getting that to-do stuff done.  I guess that includes blogging.  Haha!   I still want the list to exist so the items aren't lost into thin air - as so often happens, but I am comfortable letting them sit on that list for as long as it takes.Ten years ago ... everything I just said would be characterized (privately - in my brain) as just crazy talk.  I would move heaven and earth to accomplish everything.  Now I find \"heaven and earth\" can wait ... I am busy doing ... well ... sometimes nothing at all - just rambling around in my own thoughts.And then there is that image in the mirror.My image has changed for sure when I look into the mirror.  I remember a time when that image got spruced up every single morning, with blow drying my hair, adding making up, and clothing myself in stylish clothes that suited my frame.  Now I accept the fact that my image is who I actually am - and I am not so hell bent on changing it.  In fact, that acceptance has been very freeing.  No matter what I do ... there is little chance I will be mistaken for someone 30 years younger.  So my focus is more how I feel from the inside out rather than the outside in.  Comfortable clothes, moisture cream for my skin and good sanitary habits are good enough.Is it laziness on my part that I don't try to control all these things as I once did?  Or have I just managed to accept my current stage of life?Still some of my peers resist relaxing into senior years.  I have watched a few expound on about \"never give in!!\" or \"never give up!!\" or \"push back that clock\"?   Believe me when I say I have seen a few versions of that kind of aging ... and is far from attractive.  If that is what they are going for - attractive - it is an epic fail. There is a trite but true little prayer that comes to my mind more and more. The Serenity Prayer God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,Courage to change the things I can,And wisdom to know the difference.And there is the rub ... knowing the difference!What are the things I care enough to make a difference on!  If I accept the natural limitations of my age like ... I wake slower, I walk slower, I heal slower, I think slower ... really, what is it that I don't accept.Getting off the floor can be a struggle.  I don't want to be that person you see in TV ads that can't get up off the floor and needs an emergency button to call for help.I want to move freely without discomfort.   I welcome PT and the regular leg exercises to keep myself walking on 2 legs (not 3 legs - a cane, or 4 legs - a walker.)Endurance - easy to lose, hard to get back.  Yeah ...  a work in progress. I now call my \"to-do list\" a \"suggestion list.\"  To-do lists are so over rated!  After all - nothing comes to a screeching halt if I don't do it.  (Gosh that was a hard lesson for my thick head to accept.)And ... I encourage the reality that everything I have just said will probably change as years pass and I am ok with that!  Is that grace in aging?  I don't know.  But I am spending precious (and speeding) time rambling around in my own brain at times to figure out if 'grace' is the right word.  I am also stepping outside myself just a bit and to observe my own travel through aging.  Accepting some things, pushing back on other things.  And figuring out the difference. Knowing the difference!I think that is my major accomplishment in this stage of life!"},
{"title": "Angry White People - 8 New Rules", "date": "Tuesday, September 17, 2019", "text": "I am fairly critical of Facebook.  I still have an account, despite my sincere effort to delete that account several years ago (by the way, they may say they will delete your account at your request - but they lie.)  But sometimes I find really worthwhile things on this site.  This piece is one of those worthwhile things!  Attention Angry White People: 8 New RulesKC ComptonFollowAug 25 · 7 min readA few days ago I had a great margarita at my favorite Mexican restaurant, where I visited with the wait staff , all members of the family that owns the restaurant. La abuela doesn’t speak English, so explaining to her that no, really, that was all of the queso fundido I was going to eat and no, there was no problem, got a little complex. But with sufficient broken Spanish on my part and her grandson’s help, we got it sorted out — and enjoyed a moment.A couple of days after that, I met a young woman from Ukraine whose English wasn’t great, but we managed to have an interesting conversation anyway. She told me she wants to start a YouTube channel for immigrants to share their getting-started stories. I told her it was brilliant — and I think it is.Last week, I had a couple of medical tests; two of the technicians were Latinx, one was Chinese and the other looked as though he might have had a Viking up the family tree. My doctor is Japanese. My physical therapist is from India.Yesterday in Target, a young mother wearing a hijab was checking out in front of me and taking longer than her adorable toddler daughter thought was necessary. The little girl started fussing and Mom was getting frustrated, so I played peekaboo with her until Mom had completed her transaction. As she was leaving, she mouthed “Thank you!” over her baby’s head.Today, I went for a mani-pedi and the young technicians were laughing and talking in Vietnamese as they tag-teamed my fingers and toes. The one who spoke the clearest English asked me how long it had been since my last pedicure. I shrugged, rolled my eyes and she wagged her finger at me, scolding, “You come sooner next time…” and we laughed.In the past couple of months, I have eaten food from at least six nationalities (go, Seattle!) and have had personal interactions with black people, white people, Latinx people, transgender people, Asian people, gay people, Jewish people, Hindu people, Christian people, Muslim people, unaffiliated reprobates like myself, male people, female people and people who have chosen not to pick sides. And probably a number of other categories I’ve forgotten by now because I don’t care. This is just how my life rolls in a diverse city, among a diverse community, with a heart that is richer for all of them.I recently read a Washington Post article about the shortage of labor in Maine — where the population has now grown sufficiently old that the World Bank terms it “super-aged” — and the crisis they’re dealing with because there are not enough young workers to care for all those old people.This imbalance is a harbinger of things to come for all U.S. states, the article said, but particularly for those who have fewer immigrants.Derp.People from other countries have long filled the ranks of medical professionals and caregivers in this nation, but with harsher immigration policies and a public sentiment that makes the U.S. less inviting, the immigrant population will, predictably, dwindle. Not having sufficient professionals and workers to care for elderly people will be a social and economic catastrophe in a decade or less (it’s already happening in Maine and another dozen states). One of the recommendations for the future is to “reshape the workforce” and I’d bet my hat, ass and overcoat that will involve … you guessed it! … more immigrants.I wonder how some of the horrible white people we are seeing on a daily basis these days insisting in the local Starbucks that the people a table away (who weren’t talking to them) SPEAK ENGLISH!!! or castigating the waiter in the MEXICAN restaurant where they were buying tacos (!!!) to GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM (“Unh … it’s my restaurant…”) are eventually going to deal with the fact that their lily white bum gets wiped by a foreigner or it doesn’t get wiped at all. That should be a day of reckoning, for sure.I understand that some people are convinced — possibly by a 30-year diet of Fox and Rush — that they are the master race and every one not their particular shade of beige and of their particular pedigree should bow down and make way. If that’s the way they want to play it, OK, I guess. You can’t make people not be hateful. But there need to be some guidelines. These wannabe white separatists need to fully understand the dimensions of the narrow little world they’re condemning themselves to.If I were named Queen for a Day, these are a few of the new rules I would hereby order for all those angry white people:If you don’t want immigrants to live in the U.S.A. and/or you think brown people of any type are your inferiors, you will be required to wear an indelible stamp across your forehead (not a tattoo, because we want you to have a change of heart) with a big, fat purple B for Bigot. If you are sporting this stamp, you cannot purchase anything brought to this country by an immigrant ever or made by a brown person. Food, clothing, jewelry, electronics … nada (or in English, for you, “nothing”).If you are wearing your required B-for-Bigot stamp and you become ill, you will not be able to access care by anyone brown or from another country, especially Muslim or shit-hole countries (is “shit-hole” hyphenated or one word? Whatever). You may die, but you’ll have the comfort of dying while being right about race.You have to give up any food that any immigrant group has ever introduced here. No Mexican food, no Chinese, no Thai hot, no sushi, no Indian buffet, no soul food — no nuthin’ but potatoes and whatever some Native American might be kind enough to cook up for you. They will retain the right to refuse. You cannot eat anything harvested by any immigrant ever. You will starve, but again, you’ll retain your righteousness on the way out.You will not be able to sell anything to anyone from an immigrant group or with skin darker than copy paper. If you’re a business owner or manufacturer or a tradesperson or … oh hell, anyone … you’ll notice the economic impact quickly because immigrants and brown people are, you know, drivers of our economy.You must relinquish all access to any music imported from any immigrant group or via brown people. This leaves … unh … gosh … hmmm … still thinking. Even bluegrass or old-time country are out because that came to us courtesy of that pesky Irish/Scot invasion and, even though these were my people and they borrowed heavily on the African traditions already taking root in the South, they were, you know, nasty immigrants. Certainly no blues, jazz, rock & roll, hip-hop, classical (all those Eye-talians, doncha know). Maybe you can listen to some nice Native American flute music, indigenous to this country, but again, you’ll have to rely on the kindness of the original residents of this continent and, frankly, some of them are weary of your bullshit.You will never be able to enjoy any electronic devices again — iPhones, tablets, laptops, PCs. According to the Census Bureau, despite making up only 16 percent of the resident population holding a bachelor’s degree or higher, immigrants represent 33 percent of engineers, 27 percent of mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientist, and 24 percent of physical scientists. According to the Partnership for a New American Economy, in 2011, foreign-born inventors contributed to more than 75 percent of patents issued to the top 10 patent-producing universities. Immigrants and brown people have been all up in the development of all of the electronic stuff for a long time, so … sorry. It’s not easy being racist. Buck up.Alas, no sportsball. Given the preponderance of players of color in basketball, football, tennis and such, no B-for-Bigot can enjoy the sportsball games anymore, either in person or on TV. They’ll have NASCAR … hockey … lacrosse, so that’s something. Bottom line, you don’t get to enjoy the fruits of other people’s labor if you aren’t willing to grant them as much humanity and value as you grant yourself. Very simple, actually.I could go on and on, but you get the drift. So you go ahead and sit over there in your little whitey-tighty corner, wrapped in gauze and buffered from any encounter with anyone not on your list of approved races, ethnic groups and/or gender expressions. I haven’t seen this list, but I assume you’ve all gotten together and worked it out, right? Because you seem to have such a clear picture of who is and isn’t a human being entitled to the full rights and respect one gives to others, I figured you’ve put your heads together and gotten very clear about who’s in and who’s out. Oh… that reminds me of Rule № 8.8. You have to spit in a vial and/or swab your cheek and get that DNA sorted out. I know I’m white because I did that and was quite disappointed that the results came back white-white-whitey-white — British Isles all the way, yo. I was raised being told that for sure we had a Native American ancestor (I feel you, Elizabeth Warren) and probably an African American one. So imagine my chagrin to discover I’m “pure.” You, on the other hand, may not know your pedigree and it’s essential that you do. If you’re going to be such a hate-weasel about racial purity, you will need to scientifically verify that you are actually pure. Otherwise we add the orange H for Hypocrisy stamp to your forehead. It’s gonna get crowded up there if you don’t lighten up.Meanwhile, the rest of us are going to go about our daily lives, enjoying each other’s company, benefitting from mutual relationships, taking pleasure in varieties of flavor and music and accents and skin colors and ages and religions and hair styles and personalities different from our own.Just being, you know, decent human beings who are grateful for each other’s presence in this delicious world we get to live in together.K.C.

To remember only the sanitized patriotic images that float around the internet does a disservice to those who suffered and died!This is what I remember!9-11Every anniversary of this terrible day the TV, the blog-sphere and social media is flooded with 9-11 remembrances.I support remembrances.  We must remember.What I don't support are the images that emotionalize, sanitize or minimize the truth of that attack.  Beautiful waving national flags, a tearful statute of liberty with the smoky towers behind her, the struggles of the heroes to save lives ... those images do not show the terror, the desperation and the horror experienced by the innocent lives trapped in those burning buildings.  To remember that day with vanilla patriotic images fades the stark truth.  It separates us carefully and gently from the actual ugly event.I don't think we should do that.This is the image we should hold in our minds.Remember this man!Remember that some people jumped to certain death rather than stay in the inferno of those buildings.Remember that as our innocent citizens fell from the building  they knew with certainty that these were their last seconds of life on earth ...approximately 10 seconds ...Remember that those on the ground below will never forget the terrible thudding sounds of bodies hitting pavementone after another - over and over - about 200 times.If this post makes you upset, uncomfortable, angry, or sad, then I have achieved my goal.We must never forget the real images.This is how we do honor to those who died in that attack.Remember.Post Script:My last blog post on 9-11 was September 2012. The title was Jumpers.From the reading I have done - it appears that the New York chief medical examiner's office does not consider these people \"jumpers.\"  Jumping indicates a choice and would imply suicide.  These people did not have a choice probably because of the force of the explosion, the fire behind them and the lack of breathable air.  Because of these conditions the deaths were ruled homicide.  It is a small but merciful distinction.   They most certainly were murdered."},
{"title": "My Left Thumb!", "date": "Wednesday, August 28, 2019", "text": "Will I ever learn!  Never, never knit to a Christmas deadline!During the Stay-cation with my grand dogs I set a goal to finish the two kid sweaters I am trying to complete for Christmas.  With hours and hours of knitting time available, I felt this goal was do-able.  After all - my grand daughter's sweater just needs two short sleeves and 3 buttons.  My grand nephew's top down sweater was almost to the point where you split out for the sleeves. And I have 10 whole days available!!  I can do this!!!Sadly, my left thumb feels different.  For me lots of knitting does not create over-use problems in my hands.  I feel lucky ... especially when reading about the repetitive use injuries of other crafters.  But my grand nephew's project requires more left thumb effort than normal.  My thumb is a little cranky right now.Photo Credit: Ravelry.ComDesigner's sampleThe pattern is called Miracle Sweater by Nicole Montgomery.  I love the gender neutral look of the garment, the dense feel of the fabric created, the jacket-like style, and the unique stitch itself.  I also love that the proceeds of the purchased pattern are donated to a charity.Up close Twisted Basket stitch pattern.The first thing I noticed was that although the stitch was uncomplicated to create - for some darn reason \"unknitting\" the stitch (a function often needed to correct mistakes) was difficult to do.  I did several gauge swatches - to get gauge - but also to learn and practice unknitting the Twisted Basket Stitch so I could fix errors when they occurred.  I never reached a level of comfort in that unknitting effort for this stitch (actually not one single time.)My progress to date.  Sleeves will need to be pickedup and knitting at some point.Regardless, I was not deterred by that failure.  I started the sweater anyway, determined to avoid mistakes.  I, of course, made a mistake within the first 5 rows of the woven pattern and made the problem even worse trying to correct it.  So I ripped out those 5 rows and started again - learning from that mistake, convinced I would, at least, not repeat that particular error again.And I didn't.  I made a different mistake!  You see, the stitches are stacked on top of each other in a very specific order.  Within 5 rows I made a stacking mistake - and one whole row along the back between the sleeve sections - was wrong.  And it clearly showed!  I couldn't unpack even a single stitch successfully and now I had a whole row of stitches that were wrong.  Damn.So I made a creative decision to hide that row of errors under the generous collar by tacking the collar down so the wrong row can't be seen.  It was an option I considered before I made the error because the collar had a lot of \"bounce\" in it and probably wouldn't rest easily on the shoulders when worn without tacking.  Now that decision was finalized and it killed two birds with one stone!  Excellent!!Second problem solved (without ripping out my progress.) I plowed on.But there are limits.  At this point, if I cannot fix or hide an error that can only be corrected by ripping out, I will stop this project and choose another pattern ... I don't want to start completely over.  Finding this pattern took a lot of time at the beginning.  And I still like it.When the third error rolled around (surprised? ... not me) I somehow miraculously managed to de-construct the stitch - and mostly get it right.  Right enough to be acceptable to the casual eye.  Not perfect, but acceptable.Is that the end of the errors knitting this beautiful stitch?  No chance - the risk is still very very much there.  But if I can avoid the blinding frustration that grows with each error maybe I can avoid pitching this project deep into my trash can.  It wouldn't be the first time I pitched yarn, a partially complete project and the pattern into the garbage.I secretly planned to maybe make this same sweater for my grand daughter at some point.  I really love the look of the stitch, and I love my grand daughter beyond all measure, BUT, no second sweater in this pattern for me - I also love my left thumb because without it - knitting would be very very hard.Finally, there is one other small problem with this stitch.  Besides eating up a lot of yarn (which I was prepared for), it eats up lot of time.   A . LOT . OF . TIME.  In the picture above, the middle white markers show where I began 5 days ago.  Each day was about 4-5 hours of knitting.  That is 20 to 25 hours of knitting on a child's size 3T sweater.  While I was knitting the gauge swatch I could see it was time consuming - but I figured that as I got better with the stitch, I would get faster ... and I did.  But now I see how grossly off I was on time needed.  I still have 4 inches of body to do beyond the lower edge - and 2 full sleeves!When I researched this pattern in Ravelry I saw comments like \"beautiful,\" \"worth the effort,\" \"heirloom piece,\" and \"appealing.\"  The other observations were \"tedious,\" \"time consuming,\" \"patience needed.\"  All the statements are true.  My mistake?  I put more importance on the positive statements rather than the negative ones.And my thumb?  It cramped a bit this morning.  A sign that I am pushing it too much?  You betcha!  So today I am blogging about knitting and not knitting - giving this vital appendage of my body needed for knitting - my left thumb - a day off!Did you know that if you are a touch typist like me - the left thumb does absolutely nothing when typing? Ha!"},
{"title": "Stay-cation with my grand dogs", "date": "Monday, August 26, 2019", "text": "Well, here I am on another Stay-cation with my grand dogs ... and extended 10 day stay-cation ... and I am on day 5 as I write.On a previous stay-cation with my furry grand babies I waxed poetic on how restful and free these stays are. He is a little large to sit on my lap, but his head fits just fine.Liv is even larger.  She seldom sits by me, except for the first 24 hours when she is feeling abit lost by the absence of her owners.I sleep at my son's house, I stay until about noon each day, when I drive to my home (about a 20 minutes away) to check in on my husband and to see he has dinner - then I return back to the dogs around 5 or 6 to spend the evening till noon the next day.  During these times, the only things scheduled are making these trips, making dinner and maybe a load of laundry.  The rest of the time is mine.  Knitting, binge watching TV series and dog love.Except this time!We have had a few problems medical problems - dog medical problems - this time.Olivia, Liv for short, takes these absences of her family very personally.  She is a rescue.  She has abandonment issues I am sure.  She gets diarrhea - sometimes bloody diarrhea - when her owners are absent on trips.  This time it was 'normal' diarrhea, because they started her on medications before they left - and - also an additional medication should it be needed.  It was!  This problem is under control and she is adjusting.  She loves grandma (me).  But I am second best.  She can take second best when she has no choice.  On a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being a scuzzy scum-ball of a human who hates dogs ... I will be raised from my normal position of 2.0 to 1.5 by the time her 'parents' return.  She is also the smart dog.  Very very smart.  Scary smart.  So I will never be #1 because she will never forget her resucers!  My son and daughter-in-law.  She will never be abandoned again.  If something should happen to my children - I would take her!  But she doesn't know that.  Poor baby.  I am happy with being 1.5 in her life for this 10 days. Now, Rags!  The total opposite of Liv.  He has never been abandon.  In fact, my son paid thousands of dollars for his little butt from the breeder - his little English Bull Dog butt!  He is a lot of things:  very self confident, very energetic, very determined, very stubborn, VERY Bull Dog!  Except that as a full blooded English Bull Dog, he comes with all the typical inherited English Bull Dog medical issues.  I arrived 5 days ago to dog sit.  He was fine.  Three days ago he was licking his paws. The start of a swelling in his left foot between the toes.I noticed a swelling between his toes on one foot.  He has had these before, Interdigital Cysts.  I also noticed that one of the face wrinkles was red and weepy - and not a pretty color when spread open.  Two days ago I got him into his vet - a family vet who knows us well.  Three feet had cysts - one foot was infected and his wrinkle was infected.  We left with an antibiotic shot - good for 2 weeks - ointment for the toes and face and instructions.  Orders to return in a week.  Today things look little better, but one of his feet had some bleeding.  It has stopped now but ...So here is what he looks like when I am gone - visiting my husband!  Pretty sad!It is the only way to keep him from licking his toes in my absence.And when I return - there is much joy!They have a very large fenced in yard where they can safelyrun and be crazy.So this Stay-Vacation has included some nursing duties!  Good thing I have previous medical training - and I am not shy of diarrhea, blood, or icky green fluid build ups in a facial wrinkle.  And I am as determined and persistent as he is ... He sees me coming with tissues and he knows its wrinkle dab clean up time - and he goes in the other direction!!  Ha!  Grandma the enforcer is on the job! Where do I rate on that 1 to 5 scale with him?  Remarkably I am sitting in #1 right now.  He is a smart bulldog - a fact he keeps hidden.  He is a forgiving bulldog - a fact he demonstrates all the time.  He is not worried about being abandoned.  He doesn't even know what \"abandon\" means.  He looks better today!  'Looks' are all I have to go on - because he acts very self confident, very energetic, very determined, very stubborn, VERY Bull Dog - even with his problems! Haha!I know I will slip to #2 when his mom and dad return.  I am ok with that.A Solid #2That's me!"},
{"title": "Picture a Prairie Dog", "date": "Friday, August 9, 2019", "text": "I seem to have fallen into another blogging slump.  I guess my writing mojo just becomes dormant with some regularity.  I have come to see this behavior as \"learning\" and \"accepting\" things about myself rather than a fault or lack of consistency!Ha!  How's that for talking my way out of something I characterized as a failurein the past!The slump is not over, but as I trek a round reading and commenting on the blogs I follow, I realize that connecting occasionally with my own blog is probably a good idea. Like the Praire Dog that pokes his head out of his hole to take a look around ... this post is my head poking out.  Consider it a mini update and an indication that I still live!I am fine.  Not moody or depressed or over busy.  Just not blog inspired.I am still knitting like a banshie.  Christmas is coming and my gifts need to be completed.  Next year - if I am crazy enough to insist on knitting for Christmas - I am NOT going to use those fingering weight yarns no matter how alluring or temping the project appears - sport or worsted weight knits up so much faster.  Pictures of finished projects will take their place in their own blog posts at some point in the future.I made another trip up to Long Island with my sister to visit my mom's friend who is 94 years old.  She is still mentally pretty good and the trip was great fun.  She is plagued with some medical issues, but her brain still seems to be working just fine.  This trip left me pondering if I could choose only one life status in my very senior old age which would be better: mental alertness or physical well being.  A remarkably few people have both in their 90s so it stands to reason I won't be one of the \"very few.\"  In fact, if personal family history is any kind of predictor, I won't have either one.  Could it be a kindness to one's self to not mentally know your are physically failing - rather than witnessing the total disintegration of your physical self - while your alert mental self watches?  Ugh! That is pretty depressing now that I think on it.  Better start pondering something else - like when does \"Dancing With The Stars\" return to TV.  I feel better all ready!  My grand daughter continues to grow in leaps and bounds.  A joy to all my senses!  These first two years in a child's life are just miraculous.  Looking back one year ago - the changes are amazing.  It may be time for another grand daughter post.My exercise mojo has its ups and downs as well.  My left knee (surgery 2017) gets cranky at times.  The heat here is brutal - thank you Climate Change.  And my very expensive (but old) walking shoes don't seem to be giving me the support I need anymore - resulting in sore feet if I am standing too long.  I can fix the shoes and will do so this month.  Just wish they didn't cost $150.   The weather should break positively starting next month - and if I ice my knee before and after walking, it is manageable.  I even re-joined the senior gym so I could use the treadmill (which I hate with a passion.). The facility is air conditioned, new and cheap by gym standards so my excuses are pretty few for not going.  So \"struggle\" is the right word to describe my efforts to stay reasonably fit.Eating wise - this is my absolutely favorite time of year.  Produce is flavorful and abundant.  Some meals I just eat vegetables.  So good.  And my very favorite is corn on the cob and tomatoes.  I think I could live on just those two things alone.  Throw in a few garbanzo or kidney beans and it would probably be pretty healthy as well.  And coffee.  Need my coffee.So ... there you go!  All caught up on my boring life!  And just to clarify ... boring is A-OK for me.  I have lived a long enough to have had my share of \"events.\"  I discovered that is better to figuratively live in the middle path of life rather than to soar high and sink low.Back again when my mojo returns or a \"prairie dog poke out\" seems appropriate."},
{"title": "Time to look Up rather than Down", "date": "Friday, July 5, 2019", "text": "Why is it that looking \"Down\" is so much easier than looking \"Up?\" Is it a matter of habit or is it just human nature?  I find its too easy to look 'Down' into the daily frustrations of the current political scene, into the daily challenges of caregiving (for the third time in my life), into the realization that the plans I had for my own retirement are far from the life I live now. It is crazy thinking to look Down when Up is so much better.  I am SO really blessed at this stage of life.  Time to make a list and post it somewhere (oh, yes ...  that's right - I have a blog!!) where I can page back and remind myself of one simple constant truth:My blessings are someone else's strongest desire!So here goes my Up - (in no particular order.)I am 72!  Yes, I am grateful for that.  The other option doesn't appeal!I am retired!  That condition is not a given for everyone.  I would enjoy being completely retired (retired from cooking, house cleaning, laundry - opps - look up, up up!  Looking up ... I don't work!)I am comfortable in retirement.  No need to baby sit every penny or eat hotdogs instead of steak.  (Of course I prefer chicken and fish ... but you get the idea.)I have a close immediate family that is a regular part of my life - not geographically or emotionally distant.I wear the title of Grandmother proudly!!  An Alpine-level size Up.  A husband.  A life partner - of 52 years duration.  While he adds to my stress at times (like all spouses can do) he is in relatively good health and still standing by my side.I am healthy.  God knows ... No serious life threatening illnesses.  For my age and my \"on-again off-again\" focus on health - it is remarkable that the expiration date on something in this body hasn't come due.  (Excuse me while I find some wood to knock on.)I have friends of long and short duration.  I must not be too much a drag on them - as they keep coming back!! 😀Hobbies and interests abound.  I'd be lost without knitting and reading. Thank God for my hands and my eyes. My blog ... where I can dump thoughts that rattle in my brain and then pop out like a \"Jack in the Box\" explosion of angst (like my Democratic Debate Post - opps - looking down again - look up, look up!) Death and loss has been a rare visitor in my life.  My husband's disability has prepared me to stand independently if I should be left widowed.  No excuses like 'my spouse handled that.'  (How's that for making lemonade out of lemons.)Downsizing a life is in my rear view mirror!  My condo doesn't require a large expenditure of cash or life energy to maintain.Finally, I have my brain ... a major plus, having watched my mom's brain slowly and painfully disintegrate into nothingness ... until it finally snuffed out her life.  Dementia runs in my family.  That is a genetic pre-disposition bullet I hope to miss.Sure, I fret about not being able to travel, or participate as a couple in some activities we used to take joy in, or even go to the movies without feeling guilt about my husband left at home.  But would I change any of the above pluses for yearly vacations, broadway shows,  beach trips or hiking adventures?  No ... I really do have more than my fair way share of good things. AND I am ever so grateful that while looking 'Down,' in the past ... nothing on my 'Up' list disappeared yet.  I know that at my age, big changes can naturally be expected on that list ... but for today ... which is all any of us have ... it is all good!Do you ever do that?  Look Down too much rather than Up.  Or am I the only one who has to make a list and post it somewhere so that my aging brain doesn't get stuck in Down mode rather than Up mode?"},

{"title": "Democratic Debates", "date": "Saturday, June 29, 2019", "text": "I generally keep to the premise that my blog should be politics free.  Politics like religion has a tendency to polarize people.  When these topics are discussed, it often leads to \"I am right and You are wrong\" black and white kind of thinking.  So I have opted to keep my personal opinions about religion between me and God - where they should be, and maintain a mostly a-polictical stance by registering as an Independent and stepping out of the loop of political discussions in all settings. Oh, make no mistake, I have very strong opinions about both - but until recently I felt my own peace-of-mind was more important than trying to sway others to my way of thinking on either of these topics.Now ...  here I am - talking politics with these questions.Did you watch the first two Democratic Debates this past week?What did you think?Is there a candidate that can challenge our current wreck of a president and bring our country back to sanity? I watched both nights.  I know these are 'early days' in the election process.  But the issues facing us are gravely important.  An attack on our democracy from the inside out is happening every single day.  We must right our course as soon as possible.  Another four years on this self destructive path may damage us permanently.My goal in watching the debates was two-fold:  Who the heck are all these people AND, most importantly, is there a candidate among them that can confront and stop the re-election of the worst President in our history?You will notice that I said nothing about their policies.  Sadly, we have moved away from that kind of intelligent discussion.  It isn't about the issues any more for most of us.  It is about selecting a leader who will not be an embarrassment on the world stage, who will recognize our international friends and enemies without Cliff Notes, who can speak with intelligence and in complete understandable sentences, who gives thought and research to issues before Tweeting his mouth off, who will respect our democracy, our constitution, our laws, our institutions, and ALL human beings.  We have none of that now.That was what I was looking for.  Was there someone like that on the debate stage?There were several candidates I thought could do the job, had great ideas and could be groomed to demonstrate the qualities I listed!  But there was only one who I believe would remain cool under the sizzling glare and auditory assault of Trump that would shower down on them in the campaign ... only one who might be able to turn the tables and make Trump look even more foolish than he is now.My pick is not the front runner - Joe Biden.Joe Biden - is a likable, well known, knowledgeable and a courteous gentleman.  We hunger for those qualities in our leader - after 3 1/2 years of Trump.  However, Trump will walk all over Biden in the campagin.  Our electorate has become more combative and argumentative under Trump and would probably see Biden's positive qualities as weaknesses!  I guarantee Trump would hammer that assessment over and over again into the electorate's psyche until voting day (and after, remember \"Crooked Hillary?\"  We will ever get passed that!!)  Don't get me wrong.  I would be thrilled to see Biden win a general election but I don't think he could win against Trump.  I also believe that although Biden looks good for his age, we need the energy and focus of a younger leader.  As one debater repeated several times - It is time to pass the torch!  I agree.My pick is Kamala Harris.I think Kamala Harris has the steel spine needed to beat Trump.  She is direct, focused, and intelligent.  I watched her question Justice Brett Kavanaugh during the hearings. She is like a laser beam that cannot be distracted or deflected.  During the debates Harris was more likely to speak calmly and deliberately - something Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can't seem to do when expressing a point of view.  Both of them seem to slip toward the unfortunate stereo types of 'older man bonbastically talking' and 'excitable female.'  Kamala Harris appears to have no 'skeletons in her closet' to trip her up during the campaign. And she is not an 'old white man!'Does it seem like I am focusing on cosmetic qualities rather than the real substance of a candidates' message?  Yes ... I am.  After 3 1/2 years of a President who is filled with warts and puss-festering talk and actions - we could do with a little polish in our leader.  The quality of anyone's 'message' won't beat Donald Trump.  What will beat this President is someone who can 'give as well as they get,' who can turn Trump's snappy slogans back on him to demonstrate his empty promises, and someone who can remain steady as a rock (and Presidential) while doing it!  So far ... Kamala Harris seems to be that woman.While I typically don't care about age, race or gender in picking a leader,wouldn't it be just the MOST delicious situation EVER to see Trump taken down by a strong qualified mature Black Woman!I think she could do it.I'd like to see her do it!!What do you think?"},

Years ago I read or listened to this series - and I have decided to do it again (rare for me to re-read anything.). I highly recommend this series.But the wagon train of exercise, blogging and healthy eating have been pretty much stalled.I am here now hoping with baby steps to get back on all those wagons again!!"},

{"title": "Walking, Watching, Weight Watchers", "date": "Sunday, May 26, 2019", "text": "WalkingMy walking life took a hit last week.  All the Game of Thrones binge TV watching and all that knitting time resulted in low step counts (about 8,000 on average - so I guess not so low.)  Yes, I could have watched TV and walked in place at the same time.  But what doesn't work is walking in place and watching TV and knitting - all at the same time.  Last week wasn't a total 'slug fest' as I did get out for a few walks, and I did my Leslie Sansone Walking Indoors DVD about 3 times (my grand dogs thought that was pretty funny to watch), but reaching 10,000 steps each day just didn't happen.However, I am now off the couch! Time to get back on that walking wagon - hmm - wagons are for sitting ... time to strap on those walking shoes and get stepping again.And I am doing that - but carefully!  My left knee (2017 surgery knee) has been complaining a bit.  The answer to that problem is simple - continued walking and the return of the PT strengthening exercises  Thankfully my knee seems to warm up to the exercise if I slowly push through and step carefully.  It almost feels normal after 15 minutes so I know nothing serious is going on.  For now ice packs after walking, Advil and a knee brace are 'my friends.'  (And, let's not forget the PT leg exercises to strengthen.)On the plus side - (a very BIG PLUS),  I have discovered the many of my 'age related' complaints are minimized with all the extra movement.  I can get up in the morning with little stiffness in my legs. Even my knee feels normal again.  I don't seem to need that early morning 'adjustment' period of letting all my body parts 'wake up.'  My leg cramping problems are much reduced.  My energy levels are so much better.  And when I feel down - going out and taking a walk fixes that problem.WatchingI don't think I ever sat and watched so much back-to-back TV as I did this past week.  Game of Thrones episodes is like eating potato chips - you can't watch just one!  Although I did read the books years ago and saw most of the seasons when they first aired - that was a long ago - 8 years to be exact.  I forgot a lot of the details.  It is fun to catch up and watch them again.  But all that sitting is just too much after a bit. But I am not done with Game of Thrones.  I am still watching the back seasons of Game of Thrones through the library loan system.  Once that is finished I will be done.  I will really really miss this series.  Amazing production values, great story, total escapist type experience!  It will be hard to replace that series with something else.  After 8 years it is like saying goodbye to old friends (good guys and bad guys). Weight WatchersI started Weight Watchers in July 2018 and I went on a Weight Watcher break in December!  I was within 3 pounds of my goal weight.  That break was supposed to be a few weeks - ended up being a few months.   I guess you don't really call it a 'break.'  It is more of a stop!  Thankfully I haven't regained more than 3 pounds.  Guess my eating habits have changed for the better.  Thank you Weight Watchers.I have tried to get back on the Weight Watcher Wagon twice since December - getting on that wagon involves actually tracking what I eat and sticking to the program limitations.  The limitations aren't the problem.  I can't seem to consistently track any more - I never really enjoyed that part of it.  But I know it is an important part of the plan for success.Since I am paying a monthly fee - and not really using the program, I am sorting out if I want to just stop paying for now.  To stop paying means that I will lose access to the online features that make tracking easy.  But if I am not tracking ... *sigh* ... I guess those online features aren't as important right now.Struggling with this idea. In truth, I don't see myself tracking what I eat forever regardless of my decisions right now!  But the diet is a healthy one and very user friendly - so it is hard to just let go.  Except - I think I have already let go ... by default!  *sigh*. My enthusiasm now is walking.  The positive feedback I get from that activity is massive.  I think walking (and keeping generally to the Weight Watcher program without tracking) - if kept up will be the answer to holding my weight stable for now. So ... I have talked myself out of this monthly charge and moving away from formal adherence to the program.  We will see how it goes.I can return at any time - the time is just not right now!"},
{"title": "My Last Week", "date": "Thursday, May 23, 2019", "text": "I have to say - the last week was pretty darn wonderful.  I know I set the bar pretty darn low on the \"wonderful\" scale, but it was.My son, daughter-in-law and grand daughter were on a trip to Disney World in Florida.  As the official dog grandma, I get to spend quality dog sitting time with their funny and crazy dogs when they travel.  The white English Bull Dog is Ragnar - Rags for short.  The mixed Hound and Mountain dog mix is Olivia, Livvy for short.  They live about 20 minutes from me.Rags - a photogenic little guy!And a busy guy - always on the run.They are good friends generally.Olivia is the smart one - like really smart!Scary smart!  Since these wonderful creatures are yard trained dogs vs leash trained dogs, I find it easier to pack my bags and move in with them for dog sitting.  I travel back home every afternoon to spend time with my husband and make him dinner - then I travel back to my exuberant charges who are always over joyed to see me.What makes this time so special - beyond getting quality time with these mutts?  The answer is easy.  I do NOTHING.  Beyond making sure they are fed, medicated, and loved - and yard time of course, the time is my own.And yard time does not involve just opening the door and letting them run!  Oh no.  If I do that, they pee and then return to the door looking in with sorrow in their eyes.  Yard time must include Grand ma standing in the yard and watching them.  The 'watching them' is critical to them having fun.  It is like they are performing for my enjoyment!  And, in truth, I do get enjoyment watching them run and play. Beyond that - I do nothing.  Absolutely NOTHING.  It is grand beyond measure. This visit, however, I had two very selfish goals! Goal #1: Watch as much as I could of Game of Thrones on their cable connection (I did see the final episode in really time with the rest of the world.  Thrilling!)  And I was re-watching the previous episodes.  I made it through Season 5!  I will check out season 6 and 7 from  the Library.Goal #2: Finish knitting Esk's dress while I watch Game of Thrones. I am at the hem.  Almost!I didn't complete either goal - and you know ... that was ok!I don't answer the phone, I don't talk to anyone, or do any household chores.  I eat and snack when I want to and what I want (sharing, of course, with my mutts), but except for my time at home in the afternoons with my husband, my time is my own.  It is freedom.There is only one little downside - they wake and greet the morning at 5:30 am.  I do not!  BUT those early mornings did extend my day about 2 hours so that I had more Game of Thrones time and more knitting time.  Ha!  Who says there isn't a silver lining to every cloud!Now back to the real world!"},
{"title": "She Was Right!", "date": "Sunday, May 12, 2019", "text": "I prefer to minimize my political opinions on this blog - not eliminate them, not ignore them, not to pretend they don't exist - but limit them ... to when I just can't stand the current terrible state of our democracy and I have to explode somewhere.  So today is that day.  While others are espousing the wonders of Mothers on their blogs and in social media, I prefer to spot light one woman, both mother and statesmen, who should have been our President if we followed the popular vote.  She is not a perfect woman (no one is perfect) and she is not without her own 'baggage,' but she was prepared to represent us on the world stage with honor and strength - and that was unfairly denied her.  My space, my blog, my opinion!Time for John Pavlovitz.Hillary Was Right Calling Them “Deplorables.”Hillary Clinton was right about everything.She was right when she warned us that Donald Trump was in bed with Russia.She was right when she said our election process was being irreparably compromised. She was right when she noted his cruelty, his impulsiveness, and his recklessness.She was right when she suggested he was beholden to a murderous foreign dictator.She was right when she told us that he was dangerously incapable of self-control on social media.She was right when she pointed out the toxic hatred he was cultivating and releasing in people.She was right when she noticed the way he was dragging national discourse into the toilet. And she was right was when she called his supporters “deplorables.”At the time of the statement in 2016, she was unfairly excoriated in the media and by Republicans—but looking back she was using sober judgement, measured speech, and incredible restraint:“To just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. They’re racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic – Islamophobic – you name it.”They are.In the wake of the police shootings of black men, the street corner assaults on gay couples, the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, the defacing of synagogues, the burning of black churches, the mistreatment of migrant families—Trump’s supporters daily reveal their phobic hearts and their willingness to ignore vulnerable people’s suffering.“And unfortunately, there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people – now have 11 million.”He has.He continually cries “fake news” about the legitimate Press, while disseminating the wildest of conspiracy theories from extremists media outlets, previously and rightly marginalized because they appealed to only the tiniest lunatic fringe.  “He tweets and retweets their offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoric.” He does.Just look at his Twitter feed at any moment during the past three years, and you’ll find the unhinged, incendiary ramblings of a supremacist, terrorist sympathizer—whose account under any other circumstance—would be deactivated for its hate speech, its purposeful targeting of individuals, and its steady invocation to violence.In 2016, Hillary was being prophetic.  She used the word “deplorable,” to describe people who would soon: applaud Muslim travel bans,celebrate families separated at the border,abide children being placed in cages,demonize teenage shooting victims,defiantly deny the value of black lives,vilify sexual assault survivors,bless a predator to the Supreme Court,cheer Presidential rally cries of shooting immigrants,approve of the suppressing of Special Counsel reports,sanction the complete perversion of our Rule of Law.Deplorable, was being kind. I have many other words for such people, and they’re much stronger and far less diplomatic than that.Hillary closed her now infamous comments by saying,“Now, some of those folks—they are irredeemable, but thankfully, they are not America.”Well, she was about half right.  These people may not be America, but they represent a good 38 percent of it. That’s far too much of any nation aspiring to greatness. As long as more than a third of our country blesses such malfeasance and tolerates this kind of toxicity in the name of holding power, we’re going to continue to regress into chaos and implosion.When Hillary Clinton said that half of Trump’s supporters were deplorables, she was in essence claiming them to be filled with contempt for others, motivated by fear, and driven to exclusion. She may have been right in that moment—but the percentage today is actually much higher.Anyone still supporting him has deluded themselves into an alternate reality that makes them incapable of compassion or reasonable dialogue. All that they have seen from this President and his cadre of grifters and criminals, hasn’t proven alarming enough to wake them into decency or rouse their humanity alive.Hillary wasn’t name-calling, she was accurately describing the kind of inhumanity we are now seeing as people’s default setting. Given their support of a man who regularly uses phrases like “Crazy Maxine,” “Pocahontas,” “Pencil Neck”— or “Crooked Hillary,” their feigned offense at her supposedly offensive language was and is laughably hypocritical anyway.No, Hillary was telling the truth, as difficult as it is to admit. She was diagnosing a collective sickness that afflicts a terrifying number of Americans. The woman who should currently be helming this nation was right about far too many things, and not enough of us listened.Hatred, bigotry, supremacy, misogyny, and violent phobia are indeed sickening and repugnant and reprehensible and yes, deplorable—or at least they should be.John Pavlovitz is a writer, pastor, and activist from Wake Forest, North Carolina.

{"title": "AGAIN! ", "date": "Monday, May 6, 2019", "text": "Everyone together!\"Elaine is beginning her walking routine - AGAIN!\"The story of my life.Pedometer StoryWhile I was sick I wasn't wearing my pedometer!  The battery was dead and I couldn't find the charger and I wasn't walking much - just from my lounge chair to the bedroom and back!  Looking for the charger was a low priority.Now that I am feeling good, I decided that I didn't like the pedometer I had.  I got it at Christmas.  It wasn't that old and it worked just fine, but I really prefer a larger face with colorful icons and this was a slim line style - not as easily read as other styles. Feeling healthy and eager to get my walking shoes back on I purchased a Fitbit Versa Lite - on sale for Mother's Day.  I am very very happy with it.  The time display is large, it includes the day of the week and the date (silly, but I like confirming what I 'think' I know, 😀) and it shows 3 basic tracking items: pulse rate, steps and calories burned.  Other screens track other things, but everything I usually want is right on the first screen.So - the problem of the Fitbit was solved.Tracking StoryBack in April I mentioned a website (Walk4Fun) that I began using to track my steps on.  What a fun site to visit.  I strongly encourage you to visit the link, Walk4Fun, and check it out. Photo credit: Walk4FunThis is a full size map of the trail, but additional maps of smallersections are available on the site showing the exact locations.Briefly, it is a free website where you can log your steps - and apply them against one of many famous walking trails around the world - and see pictures of the chosen trail from your 'virtual' hike all along the way.  I chose the Appalachian Trail (AT) and I am thoroughly enjoying the 'trip.'  And to top it all off, if you have a Fitbit, you can link your Fitbit to your Walk4Fun account and your steps are automatically logged without any further effort on your part.  But if your pedometer is another brand, you can key in your step counts manually.  And then just periodically visit the site to see where you are on the map and visit some of the pictures of your travels.  Wonderful wonderful idea!Photo credit: Walk4FunMy position at approximately 76 miles on the AT.Earlier this month, my Pennsylvania cousins were visiting me and I mentioned this website. They became interested.   We formed a team on the site, and we are all walking the AT together (well, we are at different points because our individual step counts are different), but we can keep track of individual our progress.  Then we broadened the team to other family members and friends.  Now we are 9 on a team called Cousins.So now I not only enjoy seeing the pictures and my position on the maps, but I can see where I fall within the team!  My one niece is a runner and lives in Chicago.  She walks everywhere.  Her numbers are very high - very high without even trying.  Then there are team members who are inspired to get active again and fall somewhere below the leader.  But the leader inspires us to keep walking ...Great fun.Steps StoryI am one of those who is inspired to get active again and in trying to get my step numbers up - I discovered that it isn't as easy at 72 as it was at 52.  But not discouraging to me at all.  I have had to become creative in how I get those steps.  I park further away from my destination, I take walks outside, and there are inside opportunities to get steps in as part of my routine.  This morning I decided to walk around the condo while my coffee perked.  By the time it was ready, I had walked 1035 steps!  Wow.Some days don't seem to allow time for walking during the day - so I have fallen back on my tried and true Leslie Sansone - indoor walking DVDS.I have a few of her DVDS and they are really very good.  Steps movements are simple, repeated, and gradually increased in intensity as needed based on the DVD you choose.  It is a work out for sure - and it adds steps.  I even have one aimed at \"older adults.\" The DVDs are ideal for when I can't get out for that walk, or I find myself at the end of the day and short of my goal number of 10,000 steps.That's my walking update for today.It is wonderful to feel energized and well again.  As hard as that flu virus was to get passed, it increased my appreciate of how important good health is."},
{"title": "Gone With The Wind by Margaret Mitchell", "date": "Saturday, May 4, 2019", "text": "The only thing that could entertain, distract and help me pass the idle time when sick last month was the audio version of Gone With The Wind by Margaret Mitchell.My memories of reading this book and watching the movie are pretty unremarkable.  Long film, beautiful costumes, strikingly handsome actors, memorable moments - like \"Frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn.\"  Escapist kind of story.  My kind of book. Funny how are memories of a story can be so different from our impressions when coming across the same story around 40 years later.It is probably next to impossible to find anyone who does not know this basic story ... but just to be safe, here is what Wikipedia provides in summary:Gone With the Wind was first published in 1936. The story is set in Georgia during the American Civil War and Reconstruction Era.  It depicts the struggles of a young Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do plantation owner,  who must use every means at her disposal to claw her way out of poverty following Sherman's destructive \"March to the Sea.\"  As of 2014, a Harris poll found it to be the second favorite book of American readers, just behind the Bible.  It was adopted into a film in 1939.I purchased the audio version of Gone With The Wind mostly because recently I purchased the Kindle sequel  Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind by Alexandra Ripley.  I thought it would be good to reacquaint myself with the original story of Gone With The Wind before jumping into the sequel.  From what I read about the sequel - it was better than a TV movie they made.  I never saw the TV movie.As a product of the later 20th and early 21st century thinking on race and equality - I had a slightly different response to this story than when I read it 40+ years ago. Pluses:Written from the South's perspective, the story provided a fairly detailed account of how the South lived and thought at the time of our Civil War.While history books usually give a commanding detailed account of the battles and causes for this conflict, this story filled in the gaps in what it was like to live as a civilian during this war on our home soil.I have read and watched the movie of this story more than once.  This book is an example of a rare book that I will re-read.  I seldom re-read books.  It was a long, long, long story.  I love a long story and this one is herculean in its length.  The book did provide a deep understanding of character motivation - filling in the gaps that would be missed in the movie (movie running time: 3 hours, 45 minutes.)Cons:The story is marketed as a Coming of Age story set in the Civil War and Reconstruction period.  I would argue that a 'Coming of Age' label should be based on character evolution - growth and maturity gained through life experience.  I don't think that happened.Scarlett O'Hara got on my nerves so badly that by the end of the story I was ready to kill that woman myself. (I know, I know, she's make believe, but you know what I mean.) Because this was the book and not the movie, I was witness to all her thought processes and priorities.  ALL of them!  She was so self centered, willful, and shallow.  For a woman with the intense drive and intelligence to survive and succeed in post war conditions, she was just plain stupid about everything else.  She never learned ANYTHING about life or how her actions were impacting others.  She never understood what was important in life until the very end of the story when she had lost everything that mattered.  Seriously, by the end I was happy to see her finally get what was coming to her.  I felt no sympathy or pity for this woman.  Maybe a small argument could be made that she was a product of a dying way of life and was hard wired to respond as she did - but there were other female characters who were the total opposite of her ...  who also were products of the same way of living.  I think Scarlett's lack of complexity as a flawed character is probably indicative of writing in the 1930s - when good guys all wore white hats and the bad guys were just as easily identified.  Details about slavery and the \"darkies\" was hard to swallow.  During the reconstruction - when slaves were 'set free' with no life experiences, training, or history of humane treatment ... beyond slavery, there were long passages about how bad the \"darkies\" were behaving now they were free.  My 21st century self couldn't help yelling (silently) that if the Black population had not been forcibly yanked from their native land and forced -  against their will under horrible inhuman conditions - to the American colonies as slaves - those 'bad behaviors' of the \"blackies\" wouldn't exist!  No where in the telling of the story did it mention that the white men created this terrible situation they were struggling with and paying the price for that decision through generations.  Our founding fathers foresaw this problem when creating this nation, but they could not get the slave states to support Independence from England without including slavery!  But to be fair,  the book was written in the early 1930s and a more evolved recognition of the seeds of race relations was not yet recognized. Even if it was recognized - it probably had no place in a story that was designed to share the culture of the time.So now I have the sequel to this book ahead of me - called Scarlett.  Guess who it is mostly about?  I am hoping that Scarlett's behavior reflects some sort of growth after 44+ hours of listening to Gone With the Wind.  The book will get my normal 80 pages or so to grab my attention and if not, it gets deleted off my Kindle.I doubt I will read or listen to Gone With The Wind again.  I am pretty much done being aware of all Scarlett's thoughts.  I will borrow the movie from the library and watch it again.  The costumes, the beautiful people, the story ... they are still there, so it is worth another look."},
{"title": "BIG Deep Breath", "date": "Friday, May 3, 2019", "text": "Ahh, done!  A-2-Z Challenge 2019 is finished.Post Challenge UpdateBig Deep Breath. I must admit, I am kind of glad to be finished - and free once again to blog in \"any direction\" that I want.Blogging in this challenge is only limited by the letter of the alphabet - and that you post on the assigned days.  But I limited my posts by picking a theme. If I was tempted to do this challenge again I would omit the theme.  Beyond that, this challenge was very well organized and managed by the lead team and I applaud their efforts.  Thank you!!One unexpected discovery I found on the last day:  I had noticed that responses to my posts during this Challenge were few.  Not really typical but understandable if Aging is not an interesting topic for some.  On the last day of the challenge I noticed over 160 messages in my Gmail Spam Folder.  Yikes!  I opened some of the messages and noticed that many them were not one message, but a collection of 10 or 12 messages grouped together within the message.  Then I discovered that there were post responses in Spam from new and established readers.  A ton of them!!!   Gosh.  I have corrected this situation by sorting out that mess and getting visitors comments posted appropriately to each April post.  It took hours to fix.  Thank you to all that commented.  Not sure how this happened, and sorry your comments didn't make it to my blog in a timely manner.   All that has been fixed.(This is my scheduled post-Challenge update.)Maryland Sheep and Wool FestivalNext up is Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival scheduled for this coming weekend (bigger deep breath.)Already I have sanitized - cleaned everything in the guest bedroom (aka - yarn room, craft room, mental health space) - and it is flu free.  The windows in the condo have been open and fresh air has filled our space.  The attached bathroom is also 'company ready.'  Now onto the rest of the condo. The big event is Saturday!KnittingBIGGEST DEEP BREATH OF ALL.  I am back to knitting.Pictured above is a knitted dress I am working on for my grand daughter.  Right now it looks like cat vomit!  I am hoping that when I cast off in another few inches - and block this sucker - a beautiful swan will emerge from this ugly duckling.  Blocking always improves the look of knitted items - and it better not fail me now!! I am also hoping I don't regret using this speckled yarn in a dress that has a knitted pattern.  I hate when the knitted pattern competes with the yarn and they both lose.  I know better than that, but sometimes get blinded by the razzle-dazzle that caused me to purchase the yarn originally.The yarn is fingering - so it is slow going to knit, but it is super wash so easy care.  The body is A-line with the pattern repeated on the back as well.  It is hard to get a sense of the line of the body because my needles (still attached) are holding it in.  The buttons shown are there to give a sense of where buttons will go - maybe I will find the perfect buttons at the fair!  This project should have been finished by now - but I was too sick to work on it.  Trying to catch up now.  When done completely ... it better look like this. 😂That's all for now folks."},
{"title": "My Self-Destructive Path to Wellness", "date": "Wednesday, May 1, 2019", "text": "Yes, I am well despite my best efforts to undermine that effort! But I am not entirely a 'good do-bee' when left unattended!Yesterday I made a trip to the library - an innocent trip.After all, who gets into trouble going to the library.On the way I stopped at the grocery store to pick up a few things.  It can't get any more innocuous than a grocery store.  While pulling into the parking lot I got very hungry - VERY hungry.  I had left the house around lunchtime without eating (something I wouldn't ever do in my 'pre-flu, dieting days.' )Upon entering the store I decided to pick up a sandwich.  I also determined that I deserved salty fatty potato chips.  A big bag so I could have some for later as well.  After all, I had suffered! I had earned chips.I walked to the prepared food section and found 3 small ham and cheese sliders (without mayo - being virtuous because of the potato chips), walked passed the bakery and a slice of cheese cake with strawberry topping landed in my basket (fruit, you know), then I headed to the chip isle.  Being a sanely reasonable person, I decided against the big bag of chips - and decided to get the medium size bag (2-3 servings per bag size).  Ok, I got 2 of those bags.  I couldn't make up my mind between cheddar flavored chips and regular chips. As I reached the check out I noticed that the candy was on sale - buy one and get one free.  Decisions, decisions.  I settled on my all time favorite Hersey's Chocolate bars with Almonds (2 of them) and my second favorite, Baby Ruths (2 of them as well.). I just couldn't decide - and they were on sale after all, AND, just in case anyone is wondering, they both had protein: nuts!!Before my hand even hit the exit door, the Chedder flavored chips were open and I was eating them.  Hungry - remember?  When got in the car - instead of driving and eating at the same time (safety, ok) I decided to eat in the parking lot.  As I opened the ham and cheese sliders a thought cross my mind, \"You should really throw away half of this junk food.\"  Before I could let my better self take action on that thought (I had just purchased these things.  Crazy thoughts to throw them away within 10 minutes of purchase!  Who does that ??????), so before I did anything regrettable - I stuffed those sliders into my mouth, finished the potato chips, and started in on the cheese cake. Somewhere between the start of the cheese cake and the end of it, my stomach started sending messages to my brain - urgent messages - \"What the heck is going on?  For weeks you feed me nothing but soup, yogurt, scrambled eggs, lemon/honey tea, soft toast ... and now I am getting an avalanche of ... whatever this crap is!!  Have you lost your mind?\"I eyed the chocolate bar.  Seriously, I did.   I couldn't help wondering just how serious my stomach was.Ok, I won't eat the chocolate now, but I won't be throwing it away either.  (Compromise - I am nothing if not a compromise.)On the ride home I began to calculate the diet damage I had done to my months of Weight Watcher weight loss.  It wasn't pretty.  Just before I came down with the flu I returned to Weight Watchers - and the damage I did over 3 1/2 months absent from the program was only 3 1/2 lbs.  I had been good even when I wasn't being weighed weekly.  In fact, when I was seen by the doctor during the flu I had lost weight from my last Weight Watcher weigh in.  I was golden!!Except ... how would this feast - eaten in about 7.5 minutes - play out on the scale?Those 4 candy bars had to go.  I got home and unpacked my purchases.  I realized immediately that I couldn't just throw them away.  If I really wanted to throw them away, I should have thrown them out the car window driving home.  That would be littering and I couldn't do that!!I put them in the freezer.That was yesterday.Today they are gone.And they were good!  Four candy bars - spread out over time,  (a short time)because I didn't want to wake up the sleeping giant in my stomach.Now what to do about Weight Watchers!  It will be 3 weeks from my last weigh in.  How will I explain all of this?I am nothing if I am not inventive (and compromising.)Here is the tale.  I had the flu (true ... going for the sympathy vote here), and I had to take steroids for a swollen throat (also true ... more sympathy) and everyone knows that steroids adds weight to your frame no matter how little eat (absolutely true - it is the doctor's fault!)  I am off the steroids now.  Things will improve - if I just avoid libraries and grocery stores.That's my story.What do ya' think?"},

Sway slowly side to side - then slowly straighten your back to stand straight, rolling up one vertebra at a time.\"Bingo!!!  Zombie is now my final word in this challenge.  Thank you Ms. Esmonde-White.Zombie is literally my final bow as I exit this challenge.Thank you all who followed me to the very end.  I sincerely hope some of my observations have been interesting,or put a smile on your face,or gave you something to think about,or, at least, gave you a peak at one person's journey through this last stage of life!And just incase you are wondering!I probably can get my body into this Zombie position.The getting out ... that's the tricky part!"},

I had to abandon the visits to other blogs, however.  No energy and no way to catch up when new posts are added all the time.  The part I participated in was fun. Maryland Sheep and Wool FestivalI am going to get cracking on sanitizing our condo - we are expecting company next weekend for Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival Weekend (MDSW) held the first weekend of May every year.  We are expecting out of town guests for this event.  It is the 'Mother of all Sheep and Wool Festivals' in the country. I believe it is the oldest and the biggest fiber fair - with close to 300 vendors.  Events, demonstrations, classes and everything fiber related fill 2 full glorious days.  This year, however, I am starting from a major energy deficit due to illness so I won't be getting around to visit every single vender.  That is fine.  I really don't need anything with regards to yarn.  I have no intention of spending a lot of money. I just need time to soak up the feel-good vibes of this event and take in all the visual splendor that is always Maryland Sheep and Wool.This is a yearly event for me!  I always say, \"I would need to be dead to miss this fair.\"  I have amended that statement - \"I would need to be dead or down with the flu to miss MDSW.\"  When you are 'too sick to knit' (a statement I never imagined EVER saying)  - attending MDSW is not even on the radar."},

{"title": "W - Wedded", "date": "Friday, April 26, 2019", "text": "W is for WeddedSeveral years ago my daughter gave me a small book called Wait For Me: The Irritations and Consolations of a Long Marriage, by Judith Viorst.  She received it as a gift from Ms. Viorst who she knows.  My daughter gifted the book to me.  In this post - as I discuss nearly 50 years of marriage - this June - to my husband, I will feature small quotes pulled from the book.It destroys one's nerves to be amiableevery day to the same human being.Benjamin Disraeli I remember a time when my husband and I traveled to an anniversary party thrown by my family for my grand parents on their 50th wedding anniversary.  We were either engaged or newly married.  I could not imagine 50 years ... so far off - almost an impossible period of time. The IrritationsI am only trying to helpWhen I observe that every tie that you wear has been stainedBy food you have failed to transport to your mouth from your plate,And you're only trying to help when you tell me I've gained, Along with a lifetime of wisdom, a bit too much weight.Judith ViorstWhen facing our own 50th anniversary in June, I marvel at how different we both are today from who we were in 1969.  Would we have been drawn to each other in 1969 if we were as we are today?  Probably not.  My husband and I are now as different as a circle is from a square.  But we established a home and a family ...  as well dealt with the joys, sorrows and struggles of life.  Most importantly we learned to also make room for each other to grow into the people we are today.  We made so much room for change that the people we are today are not natural pairing of like minds as you would expect in a long marriage.  But that may be the key to our success.  We allowed that difference to develop and we didn't use it as a reason to divorce - as many may have.In every marriage more than a week old, thereare grounds for divorce.  The trick is to find,and continue to find, grounds for marriage.Robert AndersonThe number of couples making it into retirement together (regardless of the years married) is probably pretty good based an informal sampling of my peer group (not scientific I know.)  But couples married in their 20s that are still married to the same person at the time of retirement - well, that number is smaller, I would guess. Finding a reason to divorce seems much more common than finding a reason to stay married for 50 years.The ConsolationsIn a world here everyone's powering on and off,In a world where hacking doesn't refer to a cough,In a world where nothing on earth is too arcaneFor Google to instantaneously explain,And tattoos aren't only for thugs but for the elite,It's nice you're as twentieth-century,As stubbornly twentieth-century,As hopelessly twentieth-century as I am.Judith ViorstSo although I didn't see this anniversary when I was younger (and I can recall a few other times when I wasn't sure we would make it), we did make it to that 50 year mark!  How did we do it? First - We didn't try to change each other. Although we get in each other's way at times, our paths in life are not \"our path\" - it is more like \"my path\" and \"his path\" but parallel.  Second - We believe in the traditional vow we took.  Nothing fancy or made up.   To love, honor and obey until death do us part (although the 'obey' part I have kind of fudged a bit.)  I believe the wording of this traditional vow is the hardest of all vows to keep - short and to the point - no gray areas or wiggle room.  Finally, I guess we were just a bit lucky.Wait For MeSo just in case there's a place where we go when we die,And just in case you should get there before I do,I don't, when it's my turn, want to spend eternitylooking for you.So let's decide where we'll meet.  Let's decideWhere you'll wait for me.Judith ViorstWill we make \"until death do us part?\"  Yes.  But the thought of being the one left behind knocks me  off center a bit.  You see, I married my husband right after my college graduation ... moved from my parents home into our new life - not one day spent as an independent adult.  All those years we shared the responsibilities of living.   But since his disability I have taken over all the responsibilities - from  bills to trash - and everything in between.  I can take care of myself if he dies first ... so that is not the problem.  But who is the person I will be if that happens?   Not someone's child and not someone's wife.   I will need to sort all that out if given the chance - independently, without anyone's help.   It may takes some time, but I'll land on my feet I am quite sure.I always have.We've been through \"I told you it wasn't worth all that money.\"We've been through \"For once in your life admit that you're wrong!\"***Most of the time, what's good overrides aggravation,And so far we've somehow escaped some really close calls,Suggesting we're in this together for a durationThat could continue long after the curtain falls.Judith ViorstWhere is love in this discussion?   Despite all the songs, love stories, poetry and movies ... love is not an easy emotion to define.  It's not uncommon to hear a divorcee admit to still have love for the former spouse.  They just couldn't live together.  As a younger person I would not understand that kind of relationship.  Now after 50 years and lots of growth - I do understand it.  In my heart I believe that there must be more than love for a successful marriage that has staying power well into retirement.  That is true for us - and I believe it is true for a lot of people."},
{"title": "V - Vigilance", "date": "Thursday, April 25, 2019", "text": "V is for Vigilance!My mom was in my home for 5 years - and in Assisted Living and Nursing for 3 years.  But for two years prior to moving in with me - I could see changes happening.  This elder person who happened to be my mom was showing signs of ... well ... at first I wasn't sure what the signs represented.  She still lived independently, she still drove, she still paid her bills, she still went to church and the senior center, she still did everything she did before.  But something was changing and I couldn't put my finger on it.Decline can happen slowly.  It can easily be overlooked.  Seniors are great at hiding short falls in behaviors.  Early in their decline they are probably aware of some limitations - aware that they can't do things they used to do, aware that some tasks become just too much, or too confusing.  And they are also aware that they are probably beginning to fail in some indefinable way.  They compensate by hiding that fact from others - because independence is the last jewel of a persons life - something to be locked away where no one can take it.Family doesn't see a lot in the beginning.  I know.  I didn't.  I saw a tiny red flag in a sea of normalcy.  A tiny red flag that probably is just an imaginary spec of dust.  And subterfuge is not difficult for an elder to perform in a sea of normalcy if family isn't paying close attention. So initial years of decline can artfully be hidden from the casual eye.This inability to see is so common in families.  I know that some members of my family were unable to see what I saw.  Does that make them bad people?  Absolutely not.  But just like any other familiar thing in your life - you can overlook, fail to see what is in front of you. Or sometimes you see the problem but really don't want to see it, admit it is happening - and minimize it in your mind.  It is normal.  But so is being aware normal.  Hopefully someone in a family is aware - it is elder family member's safety net.When does that safety net needs to be activated? That is were Vigilance needs to step in!Vigilance is no more than the action or state of keeping careful watch for possible problems or difficulties.It doesn't mean stepping in at the very first sign of a memory lost, a forgotten name or an item misplaced in plain view.  We all do that.  No, vigilance means being aware of behavior patterns or problems that are new or maybe developing.My vigilance began 2 years before mom moved in with me.  When I started paying attention, I tried to make excuses for what I was seeing.  I wanted my mom to live the rest of her days independent, happy and loved.  But at some point my excuses were piling up.  I became vigilant without even knowing I was doing it.  I started my slow campaign for a move into a more secure and safe development - maybe one for seniors - with some oversight.  I really didn't think she need more than that.  At least at that point - it was what I thought.After 2 years of discussions (and 2 years of her further decline), I realized she needed more than a little oversight!  I finally convinced her to move in with me.  Within one week of that move, I discovered just how far she had declined and how exceeding good she was at hiding that fact. My gut, my vigilance for those 2 years was telling me a 'truth.'  She needed help!  I didn't realize how much help until she moved under my roof.Over her last years my vigilance slowly expanded to all parts of her life:  medical appointments, medication administration, driving, illnesses, hospitalization, rehab stays, assisted living, and nursing care.  I literally became her voice, her eyes, her decision maker, and even her 'mother' when she got confused.  In her last days when she was unconscious waiting for death, the nursing home administered a drug to reduce her anxiety through the dying process.  I approved of that.  But they wanted to give her an oral drug - and she could not swallow!  It was to be administered under the tongue.  But it made her cough every time.  She was in a coma-like state - not aware of her surroundings, but she still required someone to be vigilant on her behalf. If you have an elder person in your life - don't forget to really see them.  Don't see just what you want to see - really look, be aware, be vigilant.  Don't let that person slip through the safety net of their own world because you haven't been vigilant."},
{"title": "U - Unaware", "date": "Wednesday, April 24, 2019", "text": "U is for UnawareWhen my mom mentally began to fail in her late 70s, I was unaware of what was ahead.  I was unaware of exactly how much energy if would take of me to be her caregiver.  I was unaware that I would have to break promises I made to her regarding nursing home care.  I was unaware that as her brain failed her, I would find myself at times short of patience.  I was unaware of the total sacrifice of my personal health and emotional well-being I would have to make to care for her until her last breath. I was unaware of so much.What I did know was that I could not turn away, put her care in the hands of someone else at the first sign of problems ... not until I tried, until I had no choice.Mom lived with me for 5 years and then 3 years in Assisted Living and Nursing Home Care.  At our first family meeting with the facility's disciplines of Nursing, Social Service and Life Enrichment, I marveled on how giving, caring, patient and engaging the staff was with my mom.  There was never a harsh or impatient word with her or any of the residents (and I visit a lot and watched a lot.)   I commented that I understood very intimately how hard this elder care was - because I had walked in their shoes for 5 long years.  I will never forget the Social Worker's response to my observation ... \"Well, of course, we can do this well.  There are many of us and we work 8 hour shifts.  There was only one of you, and you worked 24/7.\"  I struggled to keep from tearing up in front of this stranger.  She was aware of the price I paid every single day - she knew very well the sacrifice that was needed.  For the first time in 5 years I felt understood.  Until that moment, rightly or wrongly, I felt I was surrounded by people who were unaware of what I gave of myself for my mom.I believe that all caregivers who take on this vocation are unaware at some level and underestimate the personal expense it will demand.  It was an isolating life, and it is truly a 'marathon' with no finish line.It has been 12 years since I moved mom into my home.  When I think of that decision and how unaware I was of the effort I was taking on - I look back and think ... would I do it again?The answer is - yes!The other \"choice\" I could not live with. I have no regrets.Would I want my children to take on this effort - on my behalf?No.  Never.  And I have already told them so.I know the cost. Mothers protect their children.They are unaware."},
{"title": "T - Time", "date": "Tuesday, April 23, 2019", "text": "T is for TimeDo you remember when you were young and Time seemed to pass ever so slowly?  You wanted Time to go by fast so you could get to the next thing!the next birthday - especially the BIG ones: the first 'teen birthday,'  sweet 16 birthday, or the big - 21st birthday.the big holidays - for me December dragged on so slowly till Christmas.first day in first grade, graduation from high school, first day in college.Curiously, the older you got, the faster time passed!  When my son signed up for the military and I dreaded the arrival of the day he left for boot camp.  He was on a delayed admission so we waited months before he left - but that time passed in a blink of an eye for me - probably dragged for him.Time passes no faster or slower than it did centuries ago.  It is just our perception of the speed of time ... but I find it interesting that almost all people share the same perception.  It is probably the only perception in life that we share exactly the same way!As I aged I looked forward to retirement and having more time.  No one really has more or less time.  Said properly - I would have more control of how I spent my Time in retirement - rather than having more of Time.  And that is the joy of retirement.  What is not so joyful about Time and retirement is that I am older now.  I know my life span is limited - my Time is limited.  Maybe I have 10 more years, maybe I have 20 ... or maybe I have only 1.Time becomes more precious - I don't want it to pass quickly. I want Time to stick around a bit longer.  I still have a looonnng list of things I would like to do and see with the Time I have left. As I get older the value I place on time is similar to the person who gets a devastating terminal diagnosis.  That person knows for a fact they don't have 10 years or 20 years or maybe not even 1.  What they do have rather suddenly is an increased value of Time.  They see each day, each hour, each minute through a different lens.I am using a different lens now. My only regret - I didn't change lenses sooner.Don't have regrets.Change your lenses now!"},
{"title": "S - Swedish Death Cleaning", "date": "Monday, April 22, 2019", "text": "S is for Swedish Death CleaningBet I got your attention with that title.  It is a real thing and it caught my attention as well.Swedish Death Cleaning for Beginners:How to Declutter and Downsize your way to a happy home and life, by Sara Hodges.  WOW - I thought.  Death Cleaning!  How is that different from any of the other declutter, downsize, minimize, frugality readings I have done?  Can there possibly be anything new \"under the sun\" on this series to topics that I haven't seen yet.The simple answer is yes - and I have actually seen this done but did not realize what it was! I am a long time down-sizer, a sometimes frugality proponent, and a dabbler in the minimalist movement!  I have done my fair share of reading on all those topics from The Complete Tightwad Gazette by Amy Dacyczyn (from the 1990s) up to and including Marie Kondo's recent best seller  The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing.Since the 1990s I have cleaned out, organized, downsized, decluttered and drove my self totally nuts - making room in a 2,200 square foot town house for returning family members to live.  First it was for my mother-in-law who was in hospice for lung cancer (yes, I was her caregiver too), then for a returning son after military service, then for a daughter during a down time, then for my mom who was no longer able to live on her own, and finally for myself and my husband as we did the traditional senior citizen downsize - to move into 1375 square feet of condo space. I thought I knew a lot about this topic - 'cause I had lots of practice.What could this little book offer me - except the answer to what was 'death cleaning.'Grims-ville!  I thought. So, of course, I read on!!What the heck is Death Cleaning?The author says it best on the first page of Chapter 1 ...\"To put it simply, the art of Swedish death cleaning is about ridding your home of possessions that you don't want, need or use, so when you do happen to kick the bucket, your loved ones are not left with the grave emotional task of shifting through 80+ years of your stuff.  It's a blatantly honest approach to decluttering your home and a very transparent way to look at all the things that you possess.\"Light bulb time!  Ok, I get it!Clean out your own stuffSo your relatives don't have to do it for you.I will say that the words \"art\" in relation to throwing things out ... and \"kick the bucket\" in relation to dying - made me smile a bit. Before you say why should I care about Death Cleaning - let me share a story about an uncle that my cousin shared with me.My Uncle Walter died the month before my mom.  His son, my cousin, called me a month later to offer his condoences.  We hadn't chatted in probably 30 years.  But we both lost parents within a month of each other.  It was good to talk.Uncle Walter lived in the same house he brought his bride to in the 1950s.  He died in 2014 and his wife pre-deceased him by many years.  You might anticipate, expect, understand ... if his house was filled to the brim with all the little items of living until 90 and on his own as a widower for many years.  But you would be wrong.  At his death, he left behind a totally cleaned out house - with only the items he needed to live.  His closets were totally bare except for his one personal clothes closet, excess furniture was gone, surfaces were totally clear.  My cousin said when they entered the house after his father's death to prepare it for sale - they discovered the wonderful gift he left behind for his children ... a house that required no cleaning, no repair and no clean out!  NONE! My Uncle did 'death cleaning' without knowing about this topic or book.So death cleaning may not be important to you - but it is a wonderful last gift to give the ones who love you.Yes, I have swept my life clean of things that were redundant and unnecessary in downsizing to this smaller condo.  But I am not done yet.  My downsize journey going forward with be for a different audience other than myself.  It will be for my children - so when they are in the midst of grieving (after I kick the bucket,) they won't have to be further weighed down by the weight of all my stuff."},

I have been too sick to do anything beyond take naps, stare at the TV with glassy eyes or listen to an audio book.  I thought this might be another cold (6th of the season), but, no, nothing simple like a cold. After 4 days of increasing symptoms I visited a mini-clinic near me.  Flu A, was the diagnosis.  Apparently it was a strain that was not covered by my flu shot.Friday was my birthday.  It was a pretty miserable day - feeling terrible - rain - and all our weekend plans cancelled. Saturday morning I woke up even worse.  Could . Not . Swallow!!  Eyes both blood shot red red red.  So I returned to the clinic ... who bounced me to the ER!  Six hours later - after fluids to get me hydrated and a CAT scan of my neck and a push of steroids through the IV to shrink my swollen throat and blood work, and new prescription drugs - the diagnosis still is  .... All Flu.  Flu.  Flu.And Saturday night, while I was feeling half way to human again - my husband spiked a temp of 102.6.  We are not out of the woods yet, I fear.Walking??  Well, its been over 2 weeks since my shoes have hit the pavement - no walking unless you count the steps from the living room recliner with TV to the bedroom and back again (between naps.). The flu really takes it out of you.All I can say is I am glad that I wrote and scheduled all the A-2-Z postings in March.  At least that goes on without me.  I am behind visiting the blogs in the challenge, but may be able to catch up at some point.While I am in a flu-coma I am listening to the audio book Gone With The Wind.  I know I read the book a very long time ago and I saw the movie and I probably listened to this audio version before - but it has been great fun to hear the story again - and at 44+ hours of listening (long book), it should distract me until I am more well.  There is a lot of civil war history in this story, of course, but it is the kind of history I really enjoy:  how people lived, what was important to them, what that war was like for the civilians - the inside story that is often missed in factual retelling of history books.I'll check back next Sunday with an update when I am not a human germ making machine (hopefully.)"},

More times than I can count, I needed to intercept / interpret / evaluate the need for care for mom against what that care would do to her in the aftermath.  Let's take an example:Mom was diagnosed with a rather large aneurysm on her descending aorta from her heart.  I agree, that is a very serious life threatening condition.  She was in the hospital, however, for one of her many UTIs (Urinary Track Infections), that are SO common in the elderly (and yes they do hospitalize the elderly at times for this condition.)  I can't remember how they discovered this aneurysm in her chest, when her complaint centered in her belly - but they did. When the doctor told us of the aneurysm, he said something like ... \"Really, this is serious, typically we wouldn't discharge her with this aneurysm and would insist on surgery to fix this.  It is a big, big, big aneurysm.  What did you think?\" ... I looked at him.  Was he kidding??  What do I think??  So I told him. \"There would be no surgery.  My mother's health was not good (many many other issues).  If she didn't die on the operating table, she would most certainly be bed ridden for the rest of her life, because the enforced weeks of bed rest would totally sap any little strength she had now.  She would never recover to her current disabled status.\"  I remember his eyes got big.  I am sure he noted in the chart that patient's daughter refused treatment for a life threatening condition.  He was off the hook.The important point here is that the elderly need an advocate with them to guide the decisions of a hospitalization - ideally 24/7 advocacy, - because care in a hospital is 24/7.  Mom was suffering mildly from her dementia at the time of this conversation.  She could converse normally to the unfamiliar ear.  If I wasn't there, I don't know how that conversation would have played out.  Would she say yes?  Would she say no?  The bottom line is that doctors want to 'fix' things - they don't want to release a patient with a life-threatening condition no matter what their age.  I get that.  But sometimes you have to balance quality of life over longevity of life.  High quality medical care can keep you going for a very long time - but it can also hurt you if not managed in a humane and reasonable way.And just so you know the full story, mom died 4 years later from dementia - not from that aneurysm which did not show on her death certificate ... or from her kidney failure or her Cardiac Heart Failure (CHF) or the painful boils on her legs or from the arthritis throughout her body - it was her brain disease, dementia, that was first on her death certificate that killed her.  Surgery I believe would have certainly taken her from this earth earlier.Was I right or was I wrong!  I guess it is a matter of opinion.  But all the decisions I made on my mom's behalf are decisions I can live with - to this very day.  I believe I gave her more life - not less - and the quality of her life was surely better than trapped in a bed.Mom was in the hospital many many times.   I was with her always.  Sometimes I would walk down the hallway to the cafeteria and I would see other very very old folks in beds - many without anyone to speak for them.  I always felt badly for those folks.  Always. I have a special soft spot in my heart for only 3 things in life:children, animals and the elderly!Everyone else can fend for themselves!"},

My grand daughter is just that cute.No really - I'll wait ...And ... because I know you didn't go back -The picture doesn't do her justice!She is a seriously cute kid!P is for PetsWhy did I begin my P post with a picture of my grand child (other than the fact she was worth a second look?)My very first 'grandchildren' had 4 legs!  Pets are 'family' to me. I know that point of view is not universal to everyone!  But if you have pets you probably understand that it is the only way on earth to get complete and total unconditional love - without judgement or expectations or anything else that gets in the way of human interactions.For the elder citizen, that unconditional shared love is important to emotional and psychological health. Just the presence of a dog or a cat in an assisted living or nursing home raises the quality of life for the residents.  In my mom's assisted living home - they had a resident dog.  Some of the homes had birds and one resident was allowed to bring her cat with her.   On my initial tour of the facility, I knew the moment I saw how pets were integrated into the daily life, this place cared about more than just the physical well being of their residents. They were interested in the whole person.So ... here are my very first grand children. MeatheadMeathead \"Meaty\" is gone now.  He was my son's first dog - and English Bull Dog.He lived until almost 12 - which is a long time for the breed.He was adored ... and he knew it!  He was well behaved and dignified in his later years.We called him 'The King' and he lived up to that title.  He is most certainly missed.GrimaceGrimace was a Pug, my son's second dog, and he is also gone now.Grimace and Meathead were buds!  Grimace was a rescue.Over the years he became a bit confused about who his owner was.He LOVED his grandma so much that towards the end of his lifehe believed he belonged to me and was just visiting my son.We were soul mates - that dog and I - and I miss him so very much.MiloMilo is a French Bulldog and he belongs to my daughter.  He is now the seniormember of the collective family dogs and considers himselfnow to be 'The King.'  (Frenchies actually think they are born King.)Milo is now in his senior years.  His grandma loves him so dearly.We share some of the same medical conditions and are about the same relative age!And that age would be 'old.'Live long, dear Milo!OliviaOlivia (Livvy for short) is another rescue and is a mixed breed dog - Mountain Dog and  Hound.She had a rocky start in life, but she hit the jackpot in finding her 'forever' home when my son anddaughter-in-law adopted her.  She is sweet, mild mannered and smart as a whip!Her vocabulary is amazing.  She is devoted beyond measure to mydaughter-in-law who found her at the pound.  Grandma calls her \"girl friend\" cause sheis just that special.Live long - dear OliviaRagnarYep!  Another English Bull Dog.  What to say about Ragnar (Rags).  Firstly,this picture is young Rags.  He is all grown now, but I love this picture.  He, like all bulldogs, thinks he is King. He is fun, overly energetic, overly athletic, exceedingly crazed, ADHD kind of 'guy.'But he is loved loved loved for all his qualities - and he loves you backwith big enthusiasitc sloppy kisses - which grandma isn't a big fan of -but she knows his heart is in a good place. This dog is smart as a whip too, and probably has a great vocabulary -but in typical bull dog fashion, he hears what you say and needs time to \"think about it\"before getting back to you on your 'request.'  Ha!Live long - dear Rags, but please, just slow down a little. Ha!  Just so you don't think that my kids have ALL the pets, here is a picture of my two boys - right, cats!  Since my grand dogs visit often and I walk them in the neighborhood, neighbors were surprise to discover I had cats ... not dogs!!Max and WallyYes, they are brothers!Max (left) and Wally (Right)Max died 2 years ago from life long kidney disease - a condition we treatedwith every other day with subcutaneous fluids - for 9 long years. He was kind of a miracle kitty because of his long life span with that disease.Wally is still with us.  He is going on 12 years old and still going strong.Did he miss his brother when he died?Not one little bit - in fact - Wally blossomed as an only cat.More outgoing, friendly, loving and inquisitive.Guess he was glad to finally step out of his brother's shadow!Live long ... dear Wally!  Life without pets would be a poor quality of life for me at any age!"},
{"title": "O - Old", "date": "Wednesday, April 17, 2019", "text": "O is for OldOr specifically - How old is old!I know I planned to base my posts on personal experience - but really - this particular post would be pretty darn short if I didn't do some research.  It might look like this.How Old Is Old?Oh, maybe 95!The End!I know. If you are 25, my current age of 72 is old, but from where I stand, it is not old!  And you can get back to me when you are 72, and tell me what you think is old then!I managed to find a free ebook on line called 40 Issues for an Aging Society - a Guide for Students, by J. James Cotter, PHD.  It is a very readable quick work - 90 pages printed out (yes, I printed it out) and it covers a broad range of issues (a \"starting point\") on aging for students (so, inquiring minds do want to know.)  The book is grounded in research with many many references for further reading on each topic.  In his introduction he makes this statement:\"The Aging Tide is coming in.  We have a new frontier of age and aging.  In 1900 about 1 in every 20 persons was old.  By 2030, it will be 1 in 5.  The fastest growing population group is those over age 85.\"Wow!  He is talking about me and my generation (crap!!). Those numbers were staggering to me.   In 2030 I will be 83 - approaching that 85 mark.  Being born in 1947, I am at the beginning of this baby-boomer generation that is flooding in behind me.The third section of his book is called:How old is old anyway?  The changing View of Age.It begins with a quiz. How do you know when you're old?    A - It's the number of years since the date on your birth certificate    B - It's how much more effort if takes to walk up that long hill.    C - It's when society tells you you're old.    D - All of the above.His answer?  D - All of the above is the answer.    Hmm....Dr. Cotter quotes the work of Ken Dychtwald in Age Power.  Mr. Dychtwald suggests a change in the way we look at older ages.  He suggest these categories:      Middlescence - 40 to 60 years of age      Late Adulthood - 60 to 80 years of age      Old Age - 80 to 100 years of ageOk!  I am liking Mr. Dychtwald's ideas!  I am ok with the label Late Adulthood!!I am not saying that to be funny!  It is pretty much how I feel physically and mentally.  Granted, sometimes in the morning I feel more like 90, but once I get my \"engine running,\" I feel like I aways did in my 50s! Increased life expectancy has changed the definitions of old.  Dr. Cotter makes the point that in Ancient Rome the average life expectancy was 20 years!  Gosh!  That sounds sooo short.  Glad I wasn't born then.  In America around 1900, the average life expectancy was 45 years.  I wouldn't happy with that either.  Today, at my age of 72 - my average life expectancy is 84.  Of course Dr. Cotter notes that many elements play into those totals - \"the advances in medicine and health care, ethnicity (inequality persists,) and environment.\"  But as you can see - the definition of \"old\" slides upward as time goes on. Not to be a \"Debbie Downer\" - but I can't help feeling that man is designed by nature to live only so long.  We are organisms, after all, and not meant to live forever.  I wonder if we have finally pushed the envelope of exactly how long we can live productive healthy lives - given the limitations that are probably hard wired into us!  Just a personal observation - not based on anything I have read.Dr. Cotter ends the chapter on How Old is Old with this statement:      \"The best definition of old - ten years older than your current age.\"I was thinking the same thing!"},
{"title": "N - No", "date": "Tuesday, April 16, 2019", "text": "N is for No!Ahh!  The Power of No!I knew the power of No when I was 2 years old - about 70 years ago.  But, as all children learn soon after they learn that glorious word, parents like Yes better than No.   No ... the word fell out of my vocabulary pretty rapidly - especially when it was followed up by time outs, angry words, and fewer treats!  (I am willful, not stupid!)No got very little use until I was in my 50s.  And I am very sorry to have waited so long to resurrect the use of the word No. In retirement and in your older years, No, becomes very very important!  The word No becomes your friend.  My mom was a Yes person until the day she died.  I guess she learned from her parents as I did - that Yes was easier.  It pleases everyone when you say it.  And generally, it makes life easier to everyone else if you say Yes.  But it typically makes your life harder when you always say Yes. I got a lot of practice saying No to my mom when I was her caregiver.  \"No, mom, you can't put that hearing aid in your mouth.\"  \"No, mom, you can't drive your car if you go through red lights.\"  \"No, mom, you can't refuse this medication if you want your heart to beat normally.\"I even got good at saying No to doctors and nurses.  \"No, my mom can't have contrast for her MRI - her kidneys are failing!!\"   \"No, I won't let her be discharged from the hospital until you fix the XYZ problem!!\"  \"No, she can't swallow pills.  Use another method (duh).\"  I said No to those folks a lot.  And let me tell you ... doctors generally don't like it when patients and caregivers speak their minds.  They are looking for a Yes!  And if you ask them to explain exactly why your No should be changed to a Yes, some doctors just don't have the time for that!I made sure my own children were paying attention to all the times I was saying No on my mom's behalf!  Listen up my darling children - It is ok to say No on my behalf if I can't speak for myself in the future.  No, I don't want to be kept alive by machines.  No, I don't want to live with either of you.  Assisted Living or Nursing Care is just fine if that is what is necessary!My daughter is employed in the Retirement Continuing Care Industry, and she understands the needs of seniors, knows my wishes.  She has it all worked out, however, in her mind. She informed me recently that she will not need to stand up and say No for me ... because she won't get a chance to get a word in.   I will be busy shouting my orders, directing my wishes, pointing my finger at everyone and saying No, No, No - loudly and often!*😝She's probably right!*PS - One other thing about No people.  They aren't all that easy to take care of in their senior years! I intend to be a handful!!  (If my children are reading now - there is a whole lot of eye rolling going on.)"},
{"title": "M - Mortality", "date": "Monday, April 15, 2019", "text": "M is for MortalityI read on Facebook'Humans are the only creatures on earth that are aware of their own mortality.'If this was on Facebook it must be true.  Ha!Don't know if that statement is correct - lots of discussion on other websites when I googled that comment.Mortality can be a difficult subject no matter how you approach it. I believe for the young, the idea of mortality is a distant theory-like idea, unlikely to occur anytime soon, if ever!!  It is sort of a 'maybe,' but surely not tomorrow or the next day!It is only when you are older - maybe retired - that you start to think about how much of a life you have left ahead of you.  I am 72.  That is not a mid-life age number no matter how you work it!  Another 28 years would put me at 100,  but I don't feel strongly about reaching 100.  If I could see age 90 - another 18-20 years - that would be nice.  Trying to determine how much longer you've got is really a silly exercise.  Tomorrow is not promised to anyone - not even someone who is 19 years old.Of course that doesn't stop me from speculating about it.  I was ponding my mortality one afternoon while I was out for a walk ... and what things around me would still be there when I am not!  Ok, stupid thought really.  Once I settled on the fact that EVERYTHING would still be here after me - I had to laugh.  I am the only object in this present moment with the shortest expiration date. Ha!  Note - I said 'object.'None of this examination of my mortality included people around me - just me outlasting stuff -  duh - stuff doesn't die!! You just have to visit an museum to know that some stuff hangs around for centuries.  Weird thoughts and where the heck to they come from.  Then it occurred to me ... isn't it possible that the idea of my own mortality is something I still 'dance around' even at the advanced age of 72.  Is one's own mortality so difficult to fully and completely accept that you just can't imagine the world without you in it?Things changed a bit when my grand child was born, and I started thinking about the milestones of her life against my own life expectancy.  Would I be alive to see her graduate from high school, get a driver's license, her first boy friend, marriage?  I never examined those questions in regards to my own children - I was young enough to say - \"Well, of course, I will be around for all that.\"   Remember one's own death is only a theory in the mind of a young person.  But now ...  how many milestones could I expect to see for my grand daughter at my current age of 72?I became a grandmother late in life. I'll miss a few of her life events, I know.  I won't say those 'misses' didn't plague me a bit - but in considering my own mortality in the number of birthdays left verses her growing up into the cutest little person ever - being present every day makes the most sense to me. In fact this actual examination of my own mortality against the milestones of my grand daughter's life gave me some peace of mind on this topic.  How lucky I am - I was here for her birth, I saw my son become a fabulous father, I saw her first Christmas, her first birthday, her first steps, her first words, her gorgeous smile!! I feel like every single day of her life that I witness is precious and important!The question of mortality?? Just not that important!I can live the rest of my days comfortably with the thought!"},
{"title": "L - Loss", "date": "Saturday, April 13, 2019", "text": "L is for LossA realistic overview of Retirement and Aging cannot be complete without talking about the topic of loss.  It is, unfortunately,  a depressing but predictable and part of the aging story - universal regardless of your income level or social standing.  For example - even Prince Philip in England has finally had his driving privileges withdrawn after a serious motor vehicle accident. The impact of age and its resulting losses knows no boundaries.All humans experience normal gains and losses throughout their lives.  Generally normal gains out weigh losses easy in life.  What is different in the elderly, is that losses far outnumber the gains as each year passes.If you are not following my line of thinking let me offer an example of my mom's gains and losses in her years with me.Mom had lived a very normal lower-middle class life after dad died in 1970.  She was a secretary, she never owned property, she drove, owned a car, saved money, and traveled.  Sure, she had losses during that time, but she also had many gains.  Independence, consistent employment and standard of living, a growing group of friends, great health, a close family, a comfortable retirement and lots of free time.  It was a typical gain-and-loss kind of life - the kind most of us live.But then aging started to slow down her retirement mojo and her losses began to outnumber her gains.It was noticeable in her late 70s - the losses looked something like this:Trouble making decisions. (A loss of confidence??  Maybe.  But not her style)Unable to balance her check book. (Definitely a red flag - she was always smart and great with numbers.  My husband took that over.)Watching TV shows with little or no story line to follow. (She stopped reading for the same reason.)Friendship circle began to shrink - some moved, some died, and some just slipped through the cracks of memory. These were all small and manageable losses, and she could function well enough to \"fake it.\" As the cost of living began to over take her retirement income, we encouraged her to move in with us.  That decision took 2 years to make and she was 80 at the time of the move.  The move represented a partial loss of independence, but a gain for her in the family \"safety net.\"Once she was living with us I noticed other losses.I noticed some odd behaviors.  (Loss of logical thinking.)She got lost driving to an event in her old neighborhood. (Loss of some memories.)She once drove through a red light while I was in her car. (Loss of attention??)She began to have problems parking in pull-in spaces. (Time to give up driving.  A BIG loss of freedom but a huge gain for safety.)Poor decision making on medical issues. (I started attending her doctor appointments.  I had to monitor her medications.)Now we had reached the point of frequent hospitalizations where the losses built one on top of each other.Heath status declined along with quality of life.  (Loss, loss, loss)Frequent falls.  Frequent infections.  Frequent in patient rehabilitations.  (Each episode a loss - with a new lower level of \"normal.\")Finally unable to climb the stairs into my townhome.  (Loss of strength - resulted in a move to Assisted Living)Serious losses that she could never get past.She moved into Assisted Living - a high quality community. (Loss of regular family contact - although I visited her 4-5 times a week.)Retirement \"nest egg\" she so carefully built over the years began to shrink with great speed.  (Every check I wrote on her behalf made me sad for her - $9,000 a month eats up years of careful saving.  The speed of loss at this stage is enormous.)She resisted community activities.  (Loss of regular social and mental stimulation.)Her health surprising remained stable for 2 years before she developed skin ulcers on her legs (a sign of other pressing medical problems beyond control due to her age.)A last hospitalization resulted in placement in the Nursing Home.  (That loss was the biggest of all - she never wanted to be in a Nursing Home.)Her dementia during this time was sliding downward quickly.  (Loss of names and faces and relationships.  She even lost her ability to swallow.  She never lost her faith in God.  Even in the worst of times she would pray.  I think she continued to know my face to the end - even if she didn't know my name.) Her losses always became my losses, too.  I struggled as her caregiver to fight back against this aging decline and dementia.  I lost the fight every single time!  And I cried a lot during this whole downward slide.  I hate to lose and I hated watching her lose!There are a few blessedly lucky and genetically gifted seniors who live independently and in good health well into their 90s.  THEY are the exception.  We all hope we can win the 'Age-Well Lottery!'I no longer mourn my mother's dead.  Everyone will die.  It is the way of nature.I do continue to mourn my mom's losses.  She deserved better from nature in her last years.She was cheated!One last sincere request from the heart of a caregiver. The next time you feel annoyed with a senior ... any senior ... try to remember -  almost all seniors are losing slowly with everyday that passes.  Try to show patience - understanding - compassion. But most of all - patience!You have not yet walked in their shoes.  I guarantee, it will be harder than you can imagine.LIS FOR LOSSTHE ABSOLUTE WORST LETTER OF THE ALPHEBET!"},

{"title": "I - Incentives", "date": "Wednesday, April 10, 2019", "text": "I is for IncentivesIn our society where becoming a senior citizen is not a 'badge of honor,' how can businesses, vendors, governments and others demonstrate through action (rather than just words) a desire to respect the citizens who are now in their older years? I believe Incentives to make life easier for our seniors is one way to correct the current conception of seniors as some how - less - than everyone else.Here are a few incentives that could be or have been made available to seniors.Shopping discounts - grocery stores, gym memberships, movie tickets, vacation travel, vehicle purchases.  These are good and probably available in some areas of the country already, but the efforts should not be limited to encouragements to spend money - which these are.More walking paths and side walks in communities.  I moved from a planned city into a local suburb - that isn't well planned.  I never ran out of side walks in my former neighborhood - I always run out in my current neighborhood.  This suggestion is good for all citizens.Book Mobiles to make regular visits to senior living facilities. When I was a kid, the Book Mobiles from local libraries visited our apartment development.  What a wonderful way of keeping the written word in communities where seniors frequent - thereby reaching some citizens who don't drive and don't have access to good public transportation.Hospitals could provide senior wings for the elderly. One hospital in a neighboring county has a senior wing!  I understand from others that it isn't well managed, but what a great idea.  Big Brother-like programs for seniors now in nursing homes - something like Adopt-a-Senior  or Adopt-a-Grandparent for local young families - expose children and seniors to each other.  Seniors often outlive many of their family support members and are isolated.  Children can be taught from a young age to enjoy and respect the elderly.  Both benefit from the effort.There are some rare nursing home and child care combinations in my state.  Expand that program.   The facilities are divided but connected for easy of visiting.  Managed well, this could be a boon to both age groups.Build more neighborhoods that allow for cross-generational residential structures.  More mother-in-law suites, more relaxed coding of land to allow for senior structures on family owned property.  Why not encourage the development of extended families!More volunteer and job opportunities for seniors - let those who want to work have an equal chance in the candidate selection process - age discrimination is against the law but humans are inventive creatures and can easily find ways around that law. We protect minorities, against sex discrimination and the disabled with laws. We encourage special incentives for active service members and veterans.  Why aren't seniors - who have lived and contributed for a life time - encourage and protected?"},
{"title": "H - Hobbies", "date": "Tuesday, April 9, 2019", "text": "H is for Hobbies The most beautiful word in all of the English Language.KnittingSo much of our lives are spent in doing stuff to make a living - a roof over our head, food on the table, heat, water, food, cell phones, TV, education for a child.  This list is exhaustive if carried to completion.  We are often tied to jobs/professions by our need to provide the basics and a few of the nice-to-haves.  A responsibility of sorts, an expectation of society that we are self-supportive ... not relying on the charity of others. All of that eats up decades of our lives.WeavingHow wonderful to FINALLY be in a position to do something for ourselves that feeds our souls, that doesn't have to be squeezed in between doing laundry or driving to work.Maybe it is something that provides no practical outcome other thanto make us or others smile like painting a picture or setting up miniature train layouts,to relax us with the repetition of the movement of our hands like knitting and crocheting, to distract us by watching sporting events or reading a book, to inspire us with music and theater and travel, to give us joy and satisfaction through volunteering and mentoring.  CrochetHow wonderful is the world with such non-essential activities in it!How amazing it is to reach the time of life when you have the opportunityto do those things full time!!!I feel sadness for folks who express a serious concern about filling their time as retired individuals.  They typically are people who are defined by their professions.  They have allowed their lives to be jailed within the box of 'work' only.  Once retired by stepping out of that box, they are at a true loss at what to do with their own precious hours - hours now that have a more visible expiration date somewhere in the future.A lace shawl I knitted for my daughter.Is it possible that in their professional lives they never once day-dreamed about doing fun stuff - stuff that has no real useful purpose other than to give us joy?I believe Habit (another H word) plays a big role in how we conduct our selves in later years.  Habit is a non-thinking, non-decision making behavior.  If you are in individual who habitually thought 'outside the box of work' and squeezed Hobbies into your precious non-work hours - you can slip into retirement more easily.  If you segmented your life into work-and-more work ... for years ... retirement will be an effort, an actual stressor, and a time of confusion or total inactivity.A knitted shawl for myself.Make room in your life for Hobbies now - whatever your age!You are worth it!If you have long retirementyou will be glad you made the effort.Note: Yes, all the pictures of my work - knitting, crochet and weaving!"},

They are happy, successful and responsible people.  What more could a mother want for her children. I accepted the fact that I would not be a grandmother.When my son announced that he and wife were expecting a child - I remember initial feelings of disbelief, needing to take deep breaths, covering my face with my hands to absorb this new bit of unbelievable information in private - while tears began to form.  My God .. could this be happening!!When this beautiful little person was born (and she was beautiful and very alert at birth) - all I could think of was ... There is a God and I guess I did something right in my 70 years on this earth!Just learning to sit.  She was pleased with herself!Eskarina is always fascinated with her granddad's glasses.He is legally blind and wears them to control bright light situations.Grand children are the icing on the cake of life!  I was happy with just the cake.I am thrilled beyond measure with the icing."},
{"title": "Sunday Brain Dump: Walk, Tears, Comments", "date": "Sunday, April 7, 2019", "text": "Sunday Brain Dump: Peeping Tom, Tears, CommentsWI promised to swing back to the blog on Sundays (even though the A-2-Z Challenge skips Sundays),  to give a walking update!  I will give that update.  BUT ... I discovered that my fingers began itching to write about some non-Challenge topics.   I felt stifled ... like mouth gagged and hands tied because I already wrote and scheduled all these other posts!!!  So it is Sunday and now that the gag is off - here is what came bubbling out:WWalking in My Neighborhood and the Peeping TomThink - hamster in a wheel.  Think - treadmill without TV.Think - circular track camouflaged as a neighborhood. Think - mental torture masquerading as a healthy activity.  That is what walking in my immediate neighborhood is to me.  When I am desperate and time is short - I am left with no choice.So here is what is good about my neighborhood walk:Safe - in a boring kind of way: no traffic, no scary people, no crime.No uneven surfaces.  I am not new to falling on public sidewalks.  Not a graceful fall either.  Pretty much a 'fall-flat-on-your-face\" fall.  Not once unfortunately.  I can count 3 times.   On the up side - falling is never boring.Always available - even at night when it is dark - the boring areas is well lighted.Gently hilly.Neighbors/friends ... we visit.Can be interesting in a \"peeping tom kind of way\" - not that I walk up to windows and look in.    But if you have your blinds up, lights on, and it is night, guess what.  I can see in!  Really ... the walk is boring - nothing to see outside.  Inside views ... who knows.  Of course, there really is nothing to see inside either.  I live in a 55+ community, and we are not partying nude with loud music and mixed drinks!  But if there is something to see from the side walk, I will look. Here is what is bad about it:Boring.Very boring.Intensely boring (unless someone has their shades up, then it is only 'very boring.')This unintentional walking track, however, is used by a lot of the residents.  One morning as I was getting into my car, I stopped a couple who regularly walks this route around the development.  I smiled and offered a casual greeting, \"Nice morning for a walk!\"  They agreed.  So I continued, \"So how many times around do you go,\" thinking they probably didn't go this route for distance - just a few times around till their exercise time was up.  They quickly responded, \"Nine times around is a mile.\"  Oh my.  They worked out the distance.  They knew exactly.  Okay, then!  And how boring - it was morning ... so peeping in windows for them!I decided to skip my walking stats - except to say I have not yet reach 10,000 steps in one day.  That is actually my first goal.  There are other goals waiting in the wings - if I don't die before that.I am adding some incentive to my steps by tracking them on the Walking4Fun website.  This site has a number of well known walking trails - one is the Appalachian Trail.  It tracks your step count against a number of well known walking trails - one being the Appalachian Trail.  Below is the map of the trail with the start marked with an S.  My marker is pretty much hidden by the start marker.  Guess I have just a few more steps to take before I even show up on the map!  Ha.Walking4Fun - AP Trail\"Make the Babies Cry\" WednesdayOh, so you didn't know there was such a day?  There is!I visit my grand daughter in day care almost every Wednesday. In the beginning she looked at me with that unblinking stare ... like she had never set eyes on me before.  Ok, I get it.  She isn't going to just give away smiley greetings (like some babies do) without you earning that smile.  I respect that!  She has standards.  I agree - you can't smile at every Tom, Dick or Harry that crosses your path!   Yea for a female who knows her own mind!!Time passes, I see her most weekends.  I see her most Wednesdays.  She warms up after the initial visual assessment of my worth (like always), and we play and she smiles and laughs, and life is good.About a month ago, I walked into day care - she took one look at me and her face resolved into red blotches, tears, and crying!   uh ... Okay ... so not exactly the welcome I was going for.  But after she pulled out of it, the visit was fabulous.  When I visit her house, or she visits my house - we have no tears. But ok. Maybe having a bad day in day care.The next time I came - same reaction - only this time she gets her good friend, a little boy in her group, crying too. Now they both are crying.  And not just little whimpers - No, these are dramatic heart felt sobs, with head down to the floor in total despair. Oh.My.God!  What ever could the care givers be thinking!!!Seriously, folks.  I am not making this stuff up.But, I am not an easy person to deter!  This is my grand baby - probably my only grand baby!!! I will persevere.  (Actually - stubborn and persistent is a good description.)So last Wednesday I visited again.  By now I have labeled this day of the week, \"Make the Babies Cry\" Wednesday!! I arrive at the day care and peek from the hallway into the infants room.  I see Eskarina standing in the middle of the room.  She is fine.  She spots me.  Nothing.  I enter.  Nothing.  I move closer - the face gets red, tears form, crying starts.  (In my brain: damn, damn, damn.).  I whip out my phone and take this picture: *Sigh*Thankfully it didn't last long and the caregiver didn't need to pick her up to comfort her.   She got control of herself and then I snapped this picture.A slight improvement I guess.  I'll take thumb over tears.We shortly got to this.  Much better.  The visit was successful.  So mark your calendars folks, and remember me on \"Make the Babies Cry Wednesdays\" around 11:00 am - when I am out in day care making babies cry.  (See?  Retirement can be interesting.)Commenting DramaFinally, as regular readers know, I had problems with commenting on some blogs and some readers had problems commenting on my blog.  I made an adjustment to my browser and the problems are fixed - at least from my perspective.

{"title": "F - Friendship", "date": "Saturday, April 6, 2019", "text": "F is for Friendship\"It's easy to be friends wheneveryone's 18.  It getsharder the older you get,as you make differentlife choices.\"Zadie SmithIf that quote is true, then friendship that lasts 60+ years or more must be very very rare, indeed.Friendships are important at any age.  My 1 year old grand daughter has a friend in her day care.  But for seniors, friendships are as about as important as air is to all living beings.Having been at my mom's side during the last decade of her life, I had a chance to see the circle of her friendships.  Mom made friends easily.  She was a friendly, cheerful, compassionate woman.  It was easy to be friends with my mom.But as she reached her late 70s, changes occurred.  She was still the same friendly happy person, but some friends move away, death claimed others, health issues became barriers, and some just slipped through the cracks of life.  Changes to the social circle happen in later years and they are similar across the elderly population.What I do know is that without careful nurturing, social networks dramatically shrink in the elderly.  Almost universally, if a senior lives long enough, they outlive some, if not all, of their peers.  It is hard to develop new friendships at that point in life. I kind of think luck or maybe just good karma plays a role in sustained friendships for seniors! But here was one exception in my mom's circle that I have been honored to witness and am eager to share! Mom had one 'tried and true' dear friend.  Mrs. R was a friend mom made in 1954 - a neighbor in our apartment development.  Through all the years they remained close friends.  Phone calls, visits, keeping in touch ... even right up to my mom's last days in the Nursing Home. Yes, there were many obstacles.  They both had health issues, both became widows, Mrs. R. moved back to her home state of New York.  Mom also had the problem of a troubled marriage being married to an alcoholic.  But those things did not seem to matter to mom and Mrs. R.  They maintained a close friendship.  Even when mom was in the depths of her dementia - and recognized few people - Mrs. R made a visit to the Nursing Home to see mom (from NY) and continued to keep in contact with me to find out how she was doing.  At mom's death, despite the fact her own health failing, Mrs. R. made sure she was represented at the funeral by other family members. She reached out to me on occasion over the last 4 years.  She just never forgot my mom.How often does that happen in life?  Friendships that spill over the divide of generations.Last fall Mrs. R. invited my sister and I to her home in Long Island.  In the last year, my mom became at Great Grand Mother - twice.  Mrs. R. was excited to hear about mom's expanding family - 4 years after mom's death - she was interested and happy about these babies.  So, yes ... my sister and I hopped on a train and spent the weekend visiting this dear friend who more than earned the title of 'Best Friend Ever!!'  In the photo above we were sharing an photo album we brought as gift for her filled with pictures of mom's Great Grand babies!For myself, I am blessed to have two friends of very long duration.   (Picture below: Left to right.  R, L and me.)  We all met at that same apartment in 1954.  As children we played together.  But life did take us in different directions.  Over the years we would bump into each other. Most people don't typically have these long term relationships.The picture below was taken at my mom's grave site on the day she was buried.  These childhood friends both came to her funeral.  And the most amazing fact of all was that my mother had been friends with their mothers for a life time.Friendships are important to all people because humans are social beings. But friendships for aging adults are a reward you give yourself for living a long life!I am reaping that reward!"},
{"title": "E - Entitlement", "date": "Friday, April 5, 2019", "text": "E is for EntitlementIn my previous professional life, I work for a multi-speciality medical group of considerable size.  The Psychiatry Department was lead by Gordon Livingston, MD.  Our paths crossed when serving on a committee together and I found this psychiatrist to be a wonderful individual - admired by peers and patients alike.  He espoused a common sense approach to mental health.  He suffered great losses in his personal life - but 'walked his own talk' through it all. He is the author of several small but powerful books filled with down to earth thoughts of the human condition and a level of compassion that is not often seen.  I highly recommend all his books.One book - Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart: Thirty True Things You Need to Know Now - has a chapter called: The problems of the elderly are frequently serious but seldom interesting.That chapter begins with this statement:Old age is commonly seen as a time of entitlement.  After long years of working, the retiree is presumably entitled to leisure, social security and senior discounts.  Yet all of these prerogatives are poor compensation for the devalued status of the elderly.  The old are stigmatized as infirm in mind and body.  Apart from their continuing role as consumer, the idea that old people have anything useful to contribute to society is seldom entertained.He continues describing further extensions of his thoughts on this subject.  But my own thoughts got stuck on the word \"entitlement.\"  Entitlement!  Yes, I do have feelings of entitlement now that I am retired.  But I hate that this word sounds somewhat self-centered and selfish.  Entitlement shouldn't feel that way.  In my mind it has elements of an earned benefit - like Social Security.  But said outside of this context, the word 'entitlement' is often used to describe individuals who think more of themselves than they should.  I really don't mean that at all.As an older citizen should I feel entitled? Used in the proper context - Yes!  I earned my years as an older citizen throughout life - education,  profession, raising a family, staying healthy, contributing to taxes and social security, preparing for my retirement.Yes, I do feel entitled to at least the same respect, compassion and understanding as I had when I was 20 or 30 years younger.  Why should those basic considerations be ignored because one is older?  Yes, I do feel devalued at times because I mark the box on forms that identifies me as \"Retired\" - not employed.  Why is aging and retirement not valued as the next stage of life that has been earned?Yes, I do sometimes feel resentment for assumptions made about my aging ... when this just a natural stage of the human life span.  Why make any assumptions at all ... when the course of each creature's aging is determined by nature?Everyone ages and no living thing is designed to live forever.Our society elevates youth and does devalue elderly.  Take one tiny example I heard that illustrates preference for youth over age.  I met a woman recently who described herself as 80 years young - rather than 80 years old.  I have heard that before, and it is an in-thing to say to make advanced years seem less ... old, I guess. Maybe she was trying to say compared to her peers - she was more active and younger at heart.  Maybe she was saying she was as young as she was ever going to be.  But when I hear that phrase, '80 years young,' I hear the cultural bias come out.  Everyone wants to be described 'younger' (except for the very young).  The word 'old' is only positive if you are under 21 and you want to be 'older.'  Each birthday makes you better, more adult, more activities you can participate in, more of just everything.  Being 'older' is good then.Do I think that 'young' is a bad word to use?  Absolutely not, young is a good word, however, it is not the only good word. There are primitive societies in the world where the elderly are viewed with esteem and revered for their advanced age and wisdom.  Primitive societies - for God's sake!!As I warmed up to other arguments of that nature,  I paused .... My own frustration and anger seeped out of the print of this post.  I thought back over my own life - all of it - and admitted to myself that I was guilty of the same insensitivities and ignorance when I was younger.  I, too, valued youth over aging.  I didn't 'get-it' till I watch my mom struggle with aging issues - literally inside my own home - up close and personal.  Is it possible that our current society created this huge generational divide by separating the elderly from the family nucleus?  Maybe those primitive societies aren't so primitive - keeping their elderly inside the family circle rather than outside it.Maybe that is how the feelings of \"entitlement\" in the elderly are born.  Did our society create the emotion of entitlement as defense mechanism in the elderly because we devalued the standing of the elderly among us? I firmly believe that the elderly should not shy away from feelings of Entitlement.  Their rights as members of society have not diminished just because they are old and/or retired.It should be recognized that even the newest of human beings - if luck is with them - will be very old some day and carry in them the wisdom of all those years. I think we can ALL agree, our world needs much more wisdom today."},
{"title": "D - Dementia", "date": "Thursday, April 4, 2019", "text": "D is for Dementia\"The baby boomers are getting older, and will stay older for longer.  And they will run right into the dementia firing range.  How will a society cope?  Especially a society that can't so readily rely on those stable family relationships that traditionally provided the backbone of care?Terry PratchettDementia (in all its ugly and life-shattering forms) is the Elephant In The Room - for retirees.  It is a tough topic that no one wants to face - a bullet everyone wants to dodge.  For anyone who has seen dementia in a loved one, it is more than just an unpleasant topic.   And it is a growing health care concern for everyone in our society.Both my grandmother and mother had dementia.  I got to stare dementia right in the eye and face the fact that with my familial history - I could be looking at my own future. When I think about that possibility too long, I want to stop typing - like right now!  Get up from the computer and walk away - and tell myself over and over again ... No, Not To Me.  This will not happen to me.   No!It is my gut reaction to dementia.  It is the scariest, saddest and most depressing of all diseases.  Well, maybe not for the person who has dementia.  But for the family watching it progress, it is devastating.  It slowly rips up your relationship with a loved one - one day at a time for years and years - until the elder doesn't even know your face!If memory was the only thing lost - it would be almost a kindness.  But in the end - if dementia continues its normal slow torturous progression through the human brain, it impacts many of the body's systems ... even the inability to swallow a sip of water.  The pain felt by family members doesn't easily pass either.  Now, almost 4 1/2 years from my mother's death from dementia I tear up at her suffering.   I still remember to this day - every single microbe of independence and humanity that was stripped from her.So my advice to all is this ...Enjoy your life while your brain is whole!Nothing is promised in the future.Nothing."},
{"title": "C - Caring", "date": "Wednesday, April 3, 2019", "text": "C is for Caring.\"To care for those who once cared for us is one of the highest honors.\"Tia Walker, The Inspired Caregiver: Finding Joy While Caring for Those You LoveI often ponder the idea of how one human can dedicate a significant portion of their own life to care for another human while others approach this topic with \"can't\" sprinkled liberally through their vocabulary.In this post I am focusing the scope of 'caring' to meet the physical needs of another human who cannot meet their own needs.  In those terms most people immediately think of caring for infants - who obviously, when born, would die without direct care of another mature human.  Nature has hard wired \"caring\" into most of us with infants and children so our species continues.  (Very wise, Mother Nature.)The best example of this 'caring' reaction was demonstrated when my grand daughter was born.  My son became a father for the first time in his 40s - later than most.  When his daughter was born, he shared with me an interesting personal discovery.  \"You know, I generally find the sound of crying children annoying.  I don't know if it is biological or not - but I don't feel that way with my daughter when she cries.\" My immediate thought ... Yes, son, it is most definitely biological!  😃 That's why I let you live through your teen age years.  Biology!!What does this have to do with retirement and aging?RetirementMy own retirement was launched prematurely - at age 59 - due to the needs of an aging mother with dementia. I was fortunate that my financial foundation allowed that choice.  But still, it was a choice.  I chose to take care of her.  I could have chosen differently.   The caring impulse that was activated in me at the birth of my children was triggered again with my mom when she started to fail.  I had to step in and actively provide assistance and care.  In my brain, it was simply something I had to do.My first 8 years of retirement - I \"worked\" without pay for her benefit -  my heart and my soul would allow nothing less. But ... was it biology - some hard wired caring reaction?  And how many folks take that step into retirement for reasons of elder care or care of grand children?  How many early retirees risk reduced incomes in their own futures because of choices like these?  I have no doubt my own retirement income was impacted by retiring early, but I also consider myself fortunate to have had those 8 years at mom's side.  Was it a good trade off?  I think so.  There are lots of things we can't afford to do now, but could I have lived with the choice of continuing to work and let the chips fall where they may with my mom?  No.  I would do it all exactly the same way again.And yet ... there are many who feel very differently.  I have had many conversations on this subject, only to find that my choice to care for my mom would not be their choice with their parents.  Oh yes, if it was their adult child - they would set their lives aside to provide care, but not for a parent.  It is a very complicated decision for some when addressing elder care issues.  But for me - the choice was clear.AgingIn my caregiving years with mom, I was exposed to tons of other senior citizens in all stages of independence or dependence.  I had a chance to see 'world class caregiver families' who surrounded and cared for their failing relatives from the moment they became aware there was a problem.  Obviously the caring response was alive and well in their family nucleus.I also saw a range of other reactions to failing elders - that swung all the way to absence entirely.  The memories of those isolated elders break my heart when I recall them ... and I wasn't even related to them.  Where is that caring response - the one that erupts without hesitation for an infant, but cannot be found for an infant-like elder who can no longer safely take care of themselves?  Maybe Mother Nature only inserts the caring response for the purposes of continuation of the species.  Maybe what is needed for elder care is not a caring gene.Maybe what is missing is: Compassion!(another C word)"},
{"title": "B - Beginnings and Baloney", "date": "Tuesday, April 2, 2019", "text": "B is for Beginningsand Baloney! (definition:  The word Baloney comes from the sandwich meat called bologna, which is typically made of leftover scraps of meat.  Briefly 'baloney' means \"nonsense.\"BEGINNINGSRetirement means different things to different people.  In my parents generation, retirement was seen an end of work, trading activity for inactivity. I am of the Baby Boomer Generation.  I think the definition of retirement is changing.  Certainly there are the 'sit-in-the-chair' types among my peers, but just as many are so active ... catching up with them is hard.My own Beginnings in retirement were at the early age of 59 - not exactly elderly by today's definitions.  Holding down a full time job outside the home and a full time job inside the home as a caregiver for my mother proved too much for me.  But true 'retirement' - my time - free time - sit-in-the-chair time - was not really mine until 8 years later, at my mom's death.True retirement came at age 67.  There was no announcement in a company newsletter or big send-off party or 'gold watch' or anything like most folks get when stepping out of a full time job.  Just a quiet transition from total dedication to another person's welfare to ... well ... it was a mystery for me at the time.BALONEY!Within a new short months of true retirement I discovered that some commonly held belief were ... Baloney!I heard a number of opinions on retirement from those in my 55+ community - ranging from the 'sit-in-your-chair' version to 'dropping-dead-at-work' version.  I think there should a happy middle ground.So ... what is 'retirement baloney' in my opinion!BALONEY #1I won't be able to fill my time when retired.  What the heck will I do?There is a measure of truth in this statement if you are 'married' to a demanding profession with no hobbies or external interests.  When mom died, I worried about that as well.  My focus in retirement was gone. It certainly was a 'job' that did demand ALL of me.  So I get it when I hear that excuse.  But it is not a balanced life - all work!  You are capable of having so much more!My Truth:Retirement might be the time to seek out that \"so much more\" for yourself.  If a life absorbing profession had been your experience, now is the time to balance out that deficiency.  Don't waste another minute being married to a job - a job that would replace you in a nano-second if you died tomorrow.  NOBODY should be all about a job ALL of their life.  Almost without exception, once folks step into retirement they fill their time with no effort - nature abhors a vacuum - and before you know it, you hear \"Gosh, how did I ever fit a job into my day?\"  And, if this isn't your truth - after trying the retired life  - return to work, by all means.BALONEY #2I love to work.  Why would I stop working if I love to work?There is truth in this statement, as well.  Some folks just love the routine of work.   But most folks over 65 admit maybe working a professionally demanding job would eventually be too much to sustain physically after a certain age, regardless of desire. My Truth: In my own case, I always thought I would return to some sort of job after mom died.  And then she died.  I started thinking.  I had been tied down with a profession for tons of years, then I was tied down with caregiving for 8 years ... and honestly, at age 67 I was ready for a little freedom.  I was ready for retirement.  But that is my story.   If you aren't ready for that freedom, you should work. It  still feels, however, like you are cheating yourself.  Why give that late-in-life energy to a job when you could give it to a person, or a hobby, or a cause?  Opportunities abound in fun jobs or rewarding volunteer opportunities if you find yourself falling into Baloney #2 thinking.BALONEY #3I can't afford to retire! Hmm... here, sadly, is a a lot of truth.  It is scary to hear the statistics about what is needed in resources for retirement and how many people are running short in that area.  Yes, they probably will be forced to work well into their senior years.  At some point no matter if you can afford it or not - many seniors will be unemployable due to any number of failing physical or mental conditions that beyond their control.My Truth:If you are many years away from retirement - prepare now.  I am no financial advisor, but it is basic good sense to live carefully and below your means at all stages of life.  My husband and I started planning for retirement in our 40s - late by some standards.  But we buckled down and started plowing funds into our nest egg - we lived far below our means, abhorring all kinds of debt.  It can be hard to take that backward step in spending during the high earning years - after all the Jones' are living the high life and you can afford that too (at least now).  After years of simple and careful living to save that retirement nest egg - the transfer to a relatively frugal retirement was possible and easy for us - we still live careful and below our means, and we live a 'smaller life' than some of our peers, but we didn't have to say - We can't afford to retire. Wonder if the Jones' can afford to retire?"},
{"title": "A - About", "date": "Monday, April 1, 2019", "text": "A is for AboutHello!Welcome new and returning visitors toMy Next 20 Years of Living Blog!  It is day one of the A-to-Z Challenge - where participants publish a series of blog posts following the order of the alphabet during the days of April (except for Sundays.)  Today bloggers post using the letter A as a guide.At the risk of being unimaginative ... I have chosen the word About for the letter A - a bit About me and a bit About the theme of my posts for the month of April.  A brief introduction of sorts.ABOUT ME!Retired Knitter is my blog name, but regular readers know me as Elaine.  This blog you are 'standing' in was born in 2009 - and it truly felt like a 'birth,' because it was created during a time of exhausting caregiving 'labor' for my mom.  It is a journal-type blog where I share interests, observations, wonderings (from over- thinking stuff), my time as a care giver, and just about anything that settles in my brain and won't let go!I am a senior citizen, a wife (50 years this June - Yikes), a parent, a new grandmother, a knitter, a reader, a thinker, a TV series binge watcher, and a lover of living.  You are visiting my online home - a place where I visit with friends and where I try to return the favor by visiting their blog homes - and we chat!  Almost like the pen pals of old, we get to know each other.ABOUT THE THEMEI have chosen Retirement - and its companion topic - Aging. I find satisfaction and gratitude at reaching this later stage of life.  Despite the negative impressions our culture gives to getting older, aging and retirement are 'gifts.'  It is like completing the full circle of life.  Sadly some never experience those gifts.  My posts will be my story and some of my mom's story.  My thoughts, observations, opinions, and experiences.  I am no authority.  I can give no advice.  I know that each person's aging and retirement experience is different.  .I won't cover every possible retirement and aging topic in the challenge - just the ones that are important to me and I can speak from my personal experience.  I started this aging journey with my mom as her caregiver.  I became her voice, her 'warrior/protector,' and her constant companion as she moved through her last years of life with dementia until her death.  Now I am walking a similar path (without the dementia I sincerely hope) and I am pleased if you want to come along this month with me - no matter your age.I have a perspective to share. Followers of all ages are welcome.  For the young, it may be your future if you are lucky.  For the not so young, it may be your present.Thank you for stopping here.ElaineRetired Knitter."},
{"title": "Walking - Hello AGAIN.", "date": "Friday, March 29, 2019", "text": "Now that all the sitting and writing is done for the A-2-Z challenge, I have the luxury of writing (once again) about other day-to-day stuff.  Before those April posts launch starting on the 1st - thought I would share my initial efforts at getting a walking routine started - AGAIN!It seems like I am always starting over to establish the walking habit.  (It could be described another way - I have developed the habit of starting walking programs.  Ha!)I was walking somewhat regularly several years ago, but then had a major setback in 2017.   I spent a lot of time in PT trying to get my left knee well, resulting finally in a surgery repair in September 2017 - which was followed by yet again more PT until December 2017.  But as anyone can tell you who has had any kind of surgery on the knee - the knee isn't back to 'real' normal for about a year.  I noticed in fall of 2018 that I could finally kneel on that knee.  It was sort of the last test of normalcy - and I passed.This spring I decided to take up a regular walking routine.  I began last week.Interesting bodily discoveries.  My knee does well - it is a bit touchy at the start but 'gets over itself' within a few minutes and cooperates with no complaint.  My heart and lungs still do just fine. I find that a bit surprising.  Not much of a set back after a nearly 2 year break.  So a 30 minute walk is no problem.  I am, however, focused mostly on steps and time - and not on speed and distance - but my walk speed is pretty good.  Close to 3 miles per hour I would guess.  Woo Hoo!!!  I expect all those indicators to improve.  I am encouraged.One problem still remains - that my current neighborhood of 2+ years isn't really walker friendly.  Sidewalks disappear, traffic is awful and visual interest is null.  So while I am still driving (at 72 you never know), I can get to wonderful walking paths and lakes and other areas of interests nearby.  I guess I will make lemonade out these lemons by taking you with me on my walks and sharing pictures of my area - new places all the time.  It will give me the incentive to get in the car for that walk (harder) rather than just stepping out of my condo for a walk (easier.)I am using my Fitbit for tracking time and steps.  If you also use Fitbit - and want to be 'friends' on the Fitbit site - so we can check each other's progress and encourage each other - drop me an email.  I would love to have you as a virtual 'walking partner' on Fitbit.   'Friends' on Fitbit  can see each other's step counts.  Just knowing that info often inspires me to put in just a few more steps and a bit more time.So on the Sundays in April (no A-2-Z posts on Sundays), I'll feature one of my walks.  And share some of the progress - not that anyone really cares about the stats except me - but it will give me the incentive to not embarrass myself by sitting too much and then being forced to admit it to you!Till next time."},

Okay - Z was a bit of a stretch (and so was X) - tying it in with my theme, but I think it works, and my Z is actually a cute way to end the whole event.  I won't share what I did.  You will have to check in on the last day in April to find out.One thing I discovered ... writing on a single topic or theme, like this challenge is designed for - it does help you crystalize some of your thoughts.  Since my theme is Aging and Retirement - I thought this would be a slam dunk.  No problem.  Whip those little buggers out with no problem.Well - I discovered differently. Much of what I had to say was based on my experiences caring for my mom through her aging and eventual death.  I haven't thought about all of that since 2014.  It stirred up a bunch of old memories.  Many of them were good memories but there were a few sad ones as well.  My (strong) opinions about the elderly were formed during that 8 year period.  And my attitudes about certain topics will come across maybe a bit strong maybe. So ... yes ... I will probably come across like an opinionated old person with an attitude!!  Hahaha!Oh well.  So be it. It is who I am now.  No escaping it!  Just 2 more posts to 'launch' and I am done until May 1st!!  Celebration Time!!!"},

{"title": "26 is a BIG number", "date": "Tuesday, March 19, 2019", "text": "Hello allSince announcing my intention to participate in the A-to-Z Blog Challenge (start date April 1), I have been busy creating blog posts on my theme of Aging and Retirement!I am pretty excited about this theme - it is a topic I have developed some pretty strong opinions on from my experiences as a caregiver and from my own aging.  But I am not an authority on anything - except my own opinions - so you won't find financial planning advice, or medical advice or even advice on the best places to live in Retirement.  No, sir, those topics are pretty well documented by other knowledgeable folks.My posts will be based on \"insider\" experiences of being an older person.  And since my experiences are as valid as the next guy - I feel pretty comfortable sharing my perspective. It will be one person's story.But . Oh . My . Golly . Gosh !!!!  ... 26 posts is a big number when you are trying to crank out all of them in advance.  So far I have 13 finalize and scheduled to launch on various dates.  I kind of feel that I have been doing nothing BUT blogging since March 1 - but have nothing actually showing on the blog at present!  Ha!There are over 200 blogs participating at this point.  The list grows.  But my goals are pretty specific with regards to finding new blogs to follow and subscribing to them.They need to use Pop Up comments.  I can't comment on blogs that use Embedded Commenting.  That is a Blogger problem that has not been addressed by Blogger yet, as far as I know.I am most interested in journal type blogs - rather than writer blogs or photography blogs and the like.  Personal preference is an expected outcome.  My goal is to develop new \"blog friendships\" - a mutual blog visiting relationship.  I enjoy blogs whose readership is listed below 500 followers.  Some blogs have thousands of followers - but it is impractical to expect relationship building when you have gobs and gobs of followers.  Some of the most fun blogs are those less than a year old - where the writer is still in the \"honeymoon phase\" with blogging and are actively engaged with the whole process. I am beginning to get excited about the challenge.  This will be my 3rd effort over its 10 years history.

It is sort of likewindow-shopping.At signup, participants must label the kind of blog they have,and declare a theme for their April posts if known.I selected my blog label as Personal - Journal, Muse Type.(That's true, right?  I 'muse' on occasion, right?).😁My theme will beRetirement.The good, the bad, and the ugly,the highs, the lows, and in-between.No advice - I am not an authority,Just one person's perspective who is in the throws of this stage of life.To make the event manageableI will use March to write my April postsand preschedule them to publish on the correct April day.That way I can use the month of April to sit back, relax and once againsee what the blog world has to offer.Sign ups are open to all bloggers during the month of March.Check out the website forA-to-Z Challenge if you are curious!Lots of good information and FAQs.A-2-Z Challenge.Wish me luck!"},
{"title": "Going Deep - Update", "date": "Tuesday, February 26, 2019", "text": "In January I discovered a blog post called   Go Deep Not Wide.  That post plugged into a theme that was trending in my brain.  Since that first exposure to Go Deep, Not Wide, it has not been far from my thoughts.  If you missed that post I encourage you to check it out by clicking on the link above.For me thought has become action in subtle ways - not an intentional change, just sort of like watching another person (me) do things differently.Using the words \"Go Deep\" to navigate 2019 generally ... theoretically ...  fits companionably with my desire to declutter and lead a simpler life.  Said another way ... Go Deep is sort of like a string that holds together many different beads.  And so ... I thought I would share some observations of \"this person\" who I have been watching  ...Email:I get a lot of email for a person who doesn't work.  Most are vendors who want me to spend money.  I usually delete without opening and sometimes un-subscribe.  But every single day I would have about 30 emails - only 5 or so were real.  So I reversed things.  I now un-subscribe as my usual action - and delete a few without opening. What a different!!  This morning only about 8 emails - and most were blog posts I keep up with.  Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!Kindle and Audio books:I think I am the fastest downloader east of the Mississippi!!  See it, want it, download it!  Done!  I justified it by telling myself that 'electronically having it' didn't create actual clutter.  True, but clutter isn't only objects.My Kindle library of books waiting to be read is large.  But I pretty much read my Kindle only when eating and before going to sleep.  The pending titles grow faster than the completed ones.  I now delete offerings from Amazon for Kindle titles without looking further.  If I do happen to see a title I want I just put it on my Wish List for later. (*sigh* next in line will be shortening by Wish List.  Ha!)The first time I counted the audiobooks on my phone there were 61 titles waiting to be heard.  Today there are 54 books.  Some were deleted because I wasn't interested in them any more, but still ... progress. I will keep my Audible membership but stop buying additional new titles - even at the cheap \"daily deals\" price  - till the list gets down to about 10 books.  I picked that number out of thin air, but it seems reasonable.Real Books:Surprisingly I am reading a few 'actual books.'  You remember what they look like - paper, glue, ink.  I occasionally purchase books - new and used - 'cause I think I want the actual paper copy of a specific title.  Of course, I don't seem to get around to reading all these purchases. I have a collection of maybe 30 books.  No more buying.  I'll read what I have and pass them on when I am done.   The books I am reading right now are:The Minimalist Home by Joshua BeckerA Stash of One's Own by Clara ParksI'll try to use the library in the future.  We have a great library system.  Taxes pay for that.  May as well make use of it.Electronic Social Media:Now here is a brain-drain and time-suck I can probably reduce dramatically ... social media!   I am registered with 4 sites and I seem to participate with only 2.Instagram - Joined this recently, but seldom visit.  I instinctively don't like the Instagram messages I get that tell me \"So and So is now following you.\"  I don't know So and So.  Why would So and So follow a stranger (me) that isn't famous, isn't selling anything, never contributes anything to the site like a picture or comment, and never even visits Instagram anymore?  Just creepy. It goes.Facebook - I am a frequent visitor.  My family is out there with pictures and stuff, and several craft websites are there as well.  I have blocked all the religious and political extremists, and the advertisements.  There is a Go Deep Facebook Page.  Reading others' interpretation of this  idea has been interesting.  As long as I can mold my experience by blocking and refusing unwanted people and sites, it stays (even with the bad press recently.)Pinterest - I get their emails all the time - lately I seldom open them.  I remember when I joined  up, I told a family member how expansive the world of ideas and projects are on Pinterest. I remember her response - I want less not more! I get it now. It goes.Blogger - I put blogging and reading blogs in this category.  It eats up more time than all the others combined, BUT it is important to me - as Marie Kondo would say - It gives me Joy!  It stays!Where it goes from here I do not know.  Guess I will just have to keep watching \"this person\" to find out."},

{"title": "Happy Birthday, Mom", "date": "Wednesday, February 6, 2019", "text": "Today is my mom's birthday.  She would have been 91 years old today if she had lived.Happy Birthday, Mom!I haven't written about her recently.  As her birthday approached,  I realized that there was a time when this blog was almost totally devoted to our experience together as she aged reaching end of life, and as I cared for her.  I think it is time to make a return trip to the life of a woman I admired and loved.If you are curious about caregiving generally, or my time with mom during those difficult last years, you can find those posts listed under the Label - Through My Caregiver's Eyes.  Labels can be found on the right side of my blog and if you select that label, the blog will sort out all those posts. The caregiver part of my life seems like a far distant memory - even though it only ended four years ago.  But I am so very glad I documented that time on this blog. I hold the memories (good and sad) securely in my life through this link.  I consider that experience to have formed me into the person I am today.  I am stronger and more understanding of the road ahead of me as I age.  I am indebted to my mom is more ways than I can count.Mom and her younger sister.They were very close.Mom was about 12 years old.This post is not about the caregiving experience.  It is about the woman I called mom - who was raised in a loving family as a child, who was beautiful and smart, and appeared to have a bright future ... and who made one misfortunate choice - a choice sealed with a vow before God in a church - and who lived for 24 years honoring that vow at great expense to herself.My mom and dad when they were dating.She is about 19 years old.My mom's name was Elaine.  I was named for her by my dad.  In the stunning random spin of  genetics, I have favored her in many ways over all of my life.  I thought we were different in only one way - the way we approached adversity.  She would live around it and with it.  Despite many terrible life experiences, she remained an easy-going sweet person all her life - even into dementia.  I have a tendency to meet adversity head on and fight through it.  I used to believe that difference separated us.  But as you will read later - maybe we were more alike than I ever thought.Mom with her father, her grandmother and me.  She wasa dedicated and loving motherbut also strict in her child-rearing.Sadly, by the time this picture was taken, she knew her marriage had been a mistake.  My dad suffered from alcoholism - an issue that I guess wasn't evident before saying \"I do.\"  Now-a-days folks typically live together before marriage and some of these issues can be discovered before taking that vow.  I am not a big proponent of 'living together,' but I understand the value it holds in really getting to know a person.  Of course, this was the 1940s - a different time.Our young family.So much is hidden behind those smiles.Mom was the glue that held us together.  She raised two girls to be completely whole and worthy citizens of this world - no easy task in the environment we called home.  As a young child and teen, I never understood why she continued this marriage.  But as I grew I began to see the whole picture somewhat differently.  She was a stay-at-home mom with 2 girls to raise, she was hundreds of miles from her extended family, she was raised to believe that once married - you were on your own - help from your parents was not to be expected, and because of her sweet personality, she did not appear strong enough to make such a difficult break in the family.  What I didn't understand at the time was that my mom took the difficult path ... the path that involved great strength.  At my dad's death I learned the true nature of her choice - it was simple.   What held us together wasn't glue - but the bedrock of her personality and her love for him.  Love is a powerful bond. My dad loved us as well - and he was a good man beneath the alcohol, but addiction is also be a powerful bond.  She chose to stay in her marriage until death.  Mom took the more difficult path in life.  I see that now.  Hindsight is 20/20 - or so they say.  It is most certainly true in my case.  After dad's death, mom's life bloomed.  She really was better without him.  She had a satisfying full time job, she became a grandmother several times over, she traveled to Europe with friends, and she had an active retirement.  She earned the peace of mind and fun experiences she had in the last half of her life.  And as I looked back at her married years - many married years that I was old enough to remember - I saw the raw strength she mustered to be a mother and wife. It is only as an adult myself that I could have judged that.Mom and I during one of her first rehab experiences.Her declining years are well documented in my caregiving posts.  When I saw mental changes that made me suspect she needed help - I stepped up.  She resisted, of course, but I didn't back down.  She eventually lived with me and then in the very last years she needed to be moved to Assisted Living and Nursing Care.  Her end was not kind to her.  Dementia is not a kind disease.  Her mom also had dementia so the genetic link I have to that line of the family is at times worrisome.  But - I have absolutely no regrets about the 8 years devoted to this woman's care.  Her gifts to me were the gift of life and her guiding hand to normal adulthood despite a dysfunctional father.  Her gifts cannot be topped by any care I gave her in the end.  It was a debt I owed.I believe that sometimes life creates a mountain for you to get passed.Some of us go around it.  Some of us go over it.  Some of us go through it.  I am a 'go through it' type of person.I think I chose the more difficult path.I see now so did my mom.Until you have had a mountain put in your wayyou may not really know what kind of person you are.Dear Mom,I miss your smiling face every single day.  It is hard to write those words without tears even after 4 years.  Rest in peace dear mom.  Your legacy lives on in your daughters for whom you gave up much.   Happy Birthday!Love,Elaine"},

{"title": "Do You 'To Do?'", "date": "Wednesday, January 30, 2019", "text": "I think I have been down this path beforebut it is an ever evolving journey soI am visiting it again.I am a list maker.And as I get older, I don't trust my brain to keep things for very long.(\"very long\" being 5 minutes - andsometimes as short as the time it takes to get across my condo.)*Sigh*It is fair to say that if it isn't on my To Do list, it doesn't have a chance of getting done.In fact, I have had to resist the impulse to put Get Dressed on the To Do list, because somedays if I am not stepping out the door - I get to 2:00 in the afternoon, look down, and find I am still in my PJs and slippers.It just wasn't on the list!!My way of keeping organized has changed over the years.  Maybe it is a reflection of age, maybe it is a consequence of a less busy life, or maybe I just get bored with one way of doing things and want to try another.I am always curious about how others maintain order in their lives.  While almost all keep some type of a list, it looks different for each individual.  I thought I might share my 3 step process to an orderly life and would love to hear what yours is.Mine starts with the Step #1 - the bedrock  ....The Big Wall CalendarThe appointments, engagements, baby / dog sitting, shopping trips, birthdays ... all go on a large wall calendar.  This works pretty good if I actually LOOK at the calendar!  Ah, that's the rub.  Looking.  Sometimes I wish my calendar was actually the size of a wall or so big as to be impossible to miss from space.Without this calendar hanging right in my face - the future is just a big black hole.  And very very important ... those dark daily strike outs help me keep track of exactly what day it is!  Sincerely, once you have been retired for a number of years, knowing the day of the week without a prompt can be chancy.  I live in fear that one day I will sit across from a Neurologist who is checking me for dementia and he will start his little check list of questions by asking me what day it is.  If I didn't check my calendar before leaving the house - my response will be, \"Can I get back to you on that?\" or \"Who cares what day of the week it is.  That is just a label and I am not into labels. \" or, my personal favorite ... \"Do you know what day of the week it is?  You first.\"  I am pretty sure that none of those responses will be good answers.  Just to paint a complete picture of this - my son or daughter would be sitting beside me rolling their eyes!!In fact, I remember just such an appointment with my mom 10 years ago - the doctor asking various questions, and I was sitting beside mom who was attempting to answer them, and as I listened (not rolling my eyes) I realized with a little anxiety - that I would need to study up for this dementia quiz myself!!!  I won't stop rehearsing my deflection responses to this question - you know, just in case!!So a big bold calendar is step #1.  (Checking it every morning is step #1.5.)Step #2 is the heart ...The To Do Lists\"To Do\" lists are different animals entirely. I used to keep daily To Dos in a bound book similar to the Bullet Style Journal - where you hand write in the daily To-Dos and checked them off as 'complete' or marked them as 'forwarded' to the next day if not completed. There were many other symbols to use on each 'to do' in that system of organization.  But mostly I completed or finished an item.  I used that method when we bought and sold property and it was a life saver that year. Previous to that in my professional life - before the world went crazy over electronic options -  I kept a large 8x10 loose leaf binder book in a leather case - very expensive if I remember correctly - like a Steven Covey or Day Timer book - with my entire life within its covers.  Lots of fancy pre-made inserts with many many spaces to fill.  It was an Epic Tome that was inches thick and very impressive!!  It sort of announced to all - I am a busy important person with so many balls in the air I must write them all down inside this expensive leather binder that has my name on it!! Did you ever have one of those? But life changes and so does your perspective on stuff.  I have reverted back to my old friend - the simple  3 x 5 index card - for the day-to-day stuff.  Almost everything goes on the card.  My life has become so simple - no job, no property transactions, no nothing - (thank God!!) the index card works just fine (as long as I don't lose it.)  Besides - on the index card I can be brutal.  Putting a small X or a check mark beside a completed item just isn't good enough.  Even a line through the words isn't good enough.  For me 'completed' has to be a Statement of Fact - an emphatic bold magic marker crossing out the existence of the To-Do entirely so it cannot be seen ever again.   \"I am done with you To Do ... never to see you again.\"  \"You other To Dos ... live in fear ... you too will be entirely obliterated with a bold line very soon.\"  Well ... as soon as I get off my new LazyBoy chair.  :-)When a card is complete - full of bold strike out marks - I rip that card up in a bunch of tiny little pieces and pitch them into the trash - a final assault on that offending list.  Of course, another to-do 3x5 card list has already been born so the process starts all over again.The 3x5 card is a flexible tool as well.  It starts out with the day of the week on top (mini-dementia quiz to see if I remember without the big calendar, Ha!) with my list of to-dos.  If I don't complete them on Monday, I simply add the next day to the top of the card.  The card might start out as a Monday card, but end up as a Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday card. If the to-do card (step #2) gets stalled, (like I lose the card), then I try to recreate the list from memory - and you can imagine how well that goes when I sometimes need prompts for identifying the day of the week.(I sure said a whole bunch of stuff about the simple 3x5 card!!  Maybe I should write a book!  Ha!)Lastly - step #3 - the big picture ...The Reference BookMy big picture is smaller these days!  But I still need a slightly larger and more permanent tool to house it in.   It is called the Reference Book.  This book is still in development.  I keep forgetting to develop it - but I have purchased the book - all new and shiny - with many lovely blank pages just waiting for me - in lovely bright orange cover which should be easy to find if when I misplace it.  I even have a matching orange case to store it in (the case is not new but how serendipitous that I had it and the color was a match.). The cover doesn't have my name on it.  I consider that a plus and a minus.  The plus - that I have evolved from needing any status symbols.  The minus - if I forget my name I have no prompt!!  Ha!  But it does have all the lovely pockets for stuff - and a place for pens. And it zips closed.  The book will house all the information that is spread over the course of a year - or longer - stuff like big projects, items in development, plans for hobbies, future goals or big tasks, activities that need tracking, budgets, birthdays, anniversaries, quotes I love, or stuff that is just stuff and fits no where else.While Step #3 isn't as important as the first two steps in getting through a single day, it would be a big loss if misplaced or destroyed.  It would be like losing detailed road map while on a trip in a strange  large city.So ... Do you Calendar or To Do?Do you use a specific method for organizing your activities like To Dos?Do you talk to your To Do List ... threatening it ... like I do?Do you know what day it is? (and no cheating by checking your calendar.) 😄"},
{"title": "In Love Again", "date": "Sunday, January 27, 2019", "text": "Before Christmas I fell in love again.It wasn't with a being - human or animal.It was with a thing!Again.Once was with a vehicle I named Maxie!  She was a beautiful, fast and comfortable car - a Maxima.  I saw her as the fancy lady with pearls and lipstick and running shoes.  She and I had been through some eventful parts of my life.  She served me well.  Tears came to my eyes when I found out she had an oil leak that would cost more to fix than her total worth at age 11 years.  She had body and internal wear and tear - not particularly the beauty she started out as.  But after 11 years of road experiences with her behind her steering wheel - it broke my heart to trade her in. I was forced to buy a new car.  Am I attached to that new car?  Not at all!  It is just transportation.  End of story.  I wasn't making that mistake again!And then there was a beautiful mature Japanese Maple in my townhouse front yard -  the showiest tree in my neighborhood - admired by all .... until we had a broken water pipe in our basement.  The fix involved digging up my entire front yard - landscaping and all- to lay new pipe. On the day they needed to remove that beautiful tree, they cut it in pieces and then pulled out the trunk with some large equipment.  It was brutal.  I had to shut my blinds while it was going on.  It hurt my heart to watch the tree's destruction. When we planted the new landscaping did I fall in love with any of the new plants?  Nope!  Stupidity shouldn't be repeated.The biggest love loss of all was my townhouse of 30 years.  That was 2 years ago and regular readers know how hard that was for me to part ways with that home.  So much love, and sorrow and happiness and joy were imprinted by our family into its very foundation.  When we moved into this condo, did I fall in love with this abode? Dear God - No!  That way lies madness!I learned my lesson!  No more loving objects!It is stupid!It is insane!  Then my new Laz Boy recliner rocker was delivered.My husband and I had talked about getting recliners for a long time.  Our 50 years of marriage was filled with furniture that had minimal fabric.  Cats, you know.  They love fabric for their claws and we loved cats.  So the choice was easy.  Get sturdy, wood type furniture - and keep the cats.  Comfort was never a consideration. Now we both have these ever so comfortable chairs - all padding and fabric.  Very very comfortable.  So far our cat Wally has shown no interest.I can hardly believe that at age 71 - I have finally gotten real grown up furniture!Here she is!! Resisting the temptation to give her a name.  But I am open to suggestions!  😂Please ignore the clutter that is to her left! It is all my knitting stuff. She is electric - buttons on the side - and she has a port for charging electronics!Woo Hoo!!!She just reclines - no heat, no vibration and she doesn't lift you to a standing position!  Just reclines.  She is electric so all I have to do is push a button and she lifts my feet up and tilts me back into the most comfortable of positions.  She supports my back perfectly when it aches from standing in the kitchen too much (You will never find me falling in love with anything 'kitchen.')  She also has a USB port so I can charge my electronics.  I know she like me - because I always feel hugged when I sit in her.My husband got the same chair in a darker color. (left)Sorry these pictures are so dark.And, yes, she is a 'she!'  I checked.  😍 A 'he' wouldn't make me feel this comfortable.So I have gone and done it again.  Jumped into the deep end of insanity.At least it will be a comfortable landing.Legs propped up looking at my Christmas Tree in December.Also you can see the kind of furniture we usually got - mostly wood.Isn't it ironic that I should follow up a post on exercisewith a post about my new LazyBoy recliner chair?Did anyone notice that?  Ha!"},

Exercise !!It should be one of those bad 'four letter words.'And yet when I do it I feel so much better.At my age - exercise is not an option.And I am not happy about that. Various parts of me stop working well when they rest for too long. Trite but true - Use it or lose it!Don't you just hate it when 'trite but true' is ... well, true!In 2018 I had no exercise goals, but I did do stuff.  I participated in an aerobic class 2 times a week and on the weight machines 2 times a week.  Routine - magic word.But all that fell apart at the end of last year.   I hurt my shoulder and was advised by my doctor to leave the weight machines alone for about 8 months.  Toning - gone. Then my aerobic class changed from Mondays Wednesdays to Tuesdays Thursdays.  I can never do Thursdays.  Aerobic activity - gone.There goes my routine.Couch potato time!!For 2 months I did pretty much nothing beyond thinkingon the couch - (by the way ... thinking is not an aerobic or toning activity ... just in case anyone was wondering.)  Everything needs to change in 2019.  And man ... do I hate change!   I found a Monday Wednesday class called Power.  It uses free weights, a step lift, exercise ball and bands ... and is designed for toning and muscle strength.  I have given Power a try and I like it a lot.I rented two DVDs from the library. This DVD does not use weights but I thought I would purchasewith this one to begin with.  I discovered in class that getting down on to the floor and get up againwas so much easier using a step up of about 4 inches.  There aregraduated risers just like in class to increase effort.In fact I liked it so much I got a step lift for the condo - and an exercise DVD to use when I miss going to Power.  The work out is similar.  Now to just work it into my day.  One problem solved.Aerobics is a stickier problem.  The DVD I purchased does address aerobics as well so maybe I can kill two birds with one stone.  Or I'll go back to walking.  It won't be an ideal solution in my neighborhood because it isn't really walker friendly.   But no matter.  I have a blogging friend who walks in her basement on bad days.  If she can walk in her basement  (for 6 miles of steps, I might add) I can walk in my neighborhood.  If you don't believe me about 6 miles a day, check out Life is Good - a blog by my friend HappyOne - Karen.  She inspired me to blog.It is a plan, at least, for now.  Without a plan or a routine, I will do nothing,(and doing nothing is not toning or aerobic activity ... just in case you were wondering.)😏"},

{"title": "Go Deeper Not Wider", "date": "Monday, January 21, 2019", "text": "So I have been tootling around the blog world looking for interesting blogs - blogs with ease of commenting.  In my search I discovered this one: Raptitude.com - Getting Better At Being Human. (Just a tiny point of clarification:  no one should think I am interested in getting better at being human - and that is the first sign that 'bettering' is probably needed!!) Ha!!  No, I was pulled into the blog by the current post called  Go Deeper Not Wider.As I read this post I can honestly admit I felt a \"wow factor.\"   It was like this guy was peeking in the window of my brain and finding something growing there that I was aware of but did not or could not express.  And he expressed it so well.In his own words his thoughts on Go Deeper Not Wider:*****No new hobbies, equipment, games, or books are allowed during this year. Instead, you have to find the value in what you already own or what you’ve already started.You improve skills rather than learning new ones. You consume media you’ve already stockpiled instead of acquiring more.You read your unread books, or even reread your favorites. You pick up the guitar again and get better at it, instead of taking up the harmonica. You finish the Gordon Ramsey Masterclass you started in April, despite your fascination with the new Annie Leibovitz one, even though it’s on sale.The guiding philosophy is “Go deeper, not wider.” Drill down for value and enrichment instead of fanning out. You turn to the wealth of options already in your house, literally and figuratively. We could call it a “Depth Year” or a “Year of Deepening” or something. *****I encourage you to read the post completely.  I believe it reflects and compliments a lot of current thinking in areas of minimalism, anti-consumerism, finding joy in what you have, and other growing ground swells of thought.   I am not sure I am up to any formal challenge or experimenting (his term) of 'deeper vs wider.'  But it does feel comfortable in my brain - and it is nice to have this image in my mind. You see, I recognize the pattern of 'going wide' as a common pattern in my life.I have a room full of yarn and about 5 three inch binders full of patterns - and I need to stop that expansion.  I won't live long enough to use all the yarn and patterns I have now.  That is not an idle statement.  I have counted the yardage and averaged the usage.  There is yarn in my yarn room that will outlive me!! I have three weaving looms.  I am not weaving.  I have two tapestry looms - I do have plans to do that.  I have fiber spindles and fiber - I don't spin.  I used to have a spinning wheel but in a moment of mental clarity I gave that to a cousin who was interested in spinning.Adult coloring was all the rage a few years ago.  I got hooked.  I have several types of color pencils (not the cheap kind either) and probably 6 books - beautiful books.  I have colored about 2 1/2 pages ... only!!!  When I look at this hobby I think - yes I would like to return. I really enjoyed it.  But seriously, 6 books with only a few pages completed?!?!I have a iPhone phone with lots of memory and 61 audio books are housed there.  61!!  If each audio book averages 10 hours a piece of listening time and I have 61 - that is over 610 hours of listening or about 25 days of listening round the clock!  Ridiculous!  My Kindle library is about 6 screens long with titles just waiting to be read.  I kindle read only before bed and while I eat - at that rate I could read these titles probably for a year without adding to them.My Craftsy account has 9 previously purchased classes.  I have viewed a few, but when Craftsy went to Bluprint they offered a one year membership - at a reduced rate - which would allow you to select 12 classes to keep permanently - AND a year to view any of their classes on line for free.  Wow - great offer - a large savings on their class costs - so I joined right up because this would be the year I would take some instruction.  I can't travel to it - so at home instruction is PERFECT!  But ... really, now instead of 9 classes that I haven't fully viewed, I will have 12 more.  I probably went 'deep' with some advanced instruction in current hobbies, but I think I went 'wide' by expanding of the class numbers I have yet to view.  *sigh* I have a pantry that is a hard-hat area!  And yet, my grocery shopping adds more to the stack of food stuffs then I use up.  What's with that??  I HATE cooking.  Sometimes I feel like I am unconsciously preparing for the apocalypse.I could go on, but the bald-faced truth is this - I need to go 'deep'  ...  not 'wide.'   I think I have been moving in this direction unconsciously over the last year.  I avoid yarn stores, and yarn websites and I try to limit my purchases at yarn fairs.  I have de-stashed yarn and books and patterns, but to the casual eye - the dent is hard to see even with a microscope.  I did give away a full size spinning wheel  and a lap loom and that felt wonderful! We will not even address the pantry issues here (but I am ready for Zombies - in case you are wondering.).Final thoughts on the Raptitude blog:He has a deep inventory of posts on various subjects.  He currently does about 2 posts a month - and many of the titles are intriguing.  I have only read this one, but I know I will visit again to look at his other posts.  I did subscribe to his blog.His blog is not a personal life sharing blog like mine or like so many I follow.  He does have a tab where he documents individual experiments (on himself) and logs the process.  And I noticed that while there is some commenting, he closes his commenting after a bit.  Finally, the blogger doesn't claim to have any professional expertise - and that is fine by me.  Sometimes when a blogger has professional creds and lets you know what they are - I can't help wonder what they are trying to 'sell.'  This blog appears to be just his thoughts and ideas.  He appears to be just a writer-guy out of Canada that thinks a lot about these subjects and wants to share his thoughts.  Not much different from us other bloggers, I guess.  In previous years I picked a word to point in the direction I wanted to go.  It is a popular habit among bloggers.  I didn't plan on picking a word this year, but after reading this post - 'Go Deep' fits me like hand to glove.   Check him out - or at least check out this post and let me know what you think.Do you prefer going 'deep' or going 'wide?'"},
{"title": "Winter", "date": "Saturday, January 19, 2019", "text": "Here we are in my favorite season.WinterYes, I know I am odd. I look at this seeming perversity this way ...  no sense in joining the fan club a season that is already crowded with tons of fans - all those folks that love  💕 spring, or live for the heat of  😎 summer, or are blinded by the beauty of  🍁  autumn.  The fan base for those seasons ... just too crowded.⛄🏔🏂I love winter.❄❅❆And I think winter loves all its fans special because we are so few.My holiday season passed without problems - thankfully.  Family and friends filled the days with happiness.  It is always a hard season for me, but my reward, as always, is reaching Winter.  Lovely, cold, crisp air, at times white, wet and pure.  Weather that draws one inside for indoor activities - like reading, hot coffee, knitting, binge TV shows, blankets and shawls, soups and stews, and ... time to think.Think on it!  Who wouldn't love sitting by a warm fire, with comfortable fuzzy slippers on, a tasty drink beside you and a favorite book or favored hobby on your lap - while Nature covers the outside with a dressing of white snow. Of course, it would help to have a fire place, which I do not.  But you get the idea.Forecasts for our area promise an 'active' snow-filled winter.  Living in a condo means snow is not a problem.  I can enjoy the beauty of this season without effort. Win-win!When I was younger and working - snow was still beautiful but a challenge.  First I would fight my way shoveling down my short sidewalk from the front door, then down 20 snow filled steps filled with the shovel  - then across another short side walk until I reached my car - and then (not done yet ...) dig out the car and the space behind it until I could reach the plowed areas.  I get exhausted now even talking about.  So glad I left that behind.I am a good snow driver even though I don't venture out much now.  I was taught to snow-drive by a father who was raised in Pennsylvania.  Those Pennsylvania folks know what they are doing in snow.  I learned the survival techniques of not getting myself stuck as well as how to avoid all those nutty drivers who have no skills and no snow capable vehicle.  Those skills saved me more times than I can count.  Working in health care I was one of those folks who needed to get on the road and arrive at work no matter the weather.  My boss was a Cardiologist who arrived at work on skis and if one of his heart patients showed up in bad weather (and they usually did) he would see them.  I personally would have thought driving in those tough conditions was enough of a cardiac 'stress test' and that putting them on a treadmill was redundant!!  Ha. So I am looking forward to my exciting weather season ... just as I do every year!Welcome Winter!❄❅❆Your small but dedicated fan base is faithfully here."},
{"title": "Blog Soul Searching", "date": "Thursday, January 17, 2019", "text": "Blogging has grown from a solitary activity, where I wrote for myself only, into a community activity where I visited folks' blogs, and they visited mine, and we converse through commenting, and a friendship of sorts develops, and the sharing of life experiences deepens the whole experience for everyone.Unfortunately that process has totally stalled for me. No matter what approach I take, I am not recognized as logged into Blogger or Google when I visit most blogs.  I used to be able to leave a comment if I was persistent and stepped through pages and pages of screens matching \"cross walks\" and \"cars\" and \"buses\" and \"bikes\" to prove I am not a robot. Now even that option is gone.  After many tries it dumps me out of the system.The only way I can participate on your blog is if your blog uses 'pop up comments' rather than 'embedded comments.'  Only one or two blogs in my reading list use pop up comments.I thought long and hard about quitting blogging.  An important piece of the process has been taken away.  Then I remembered how I started!  Just me and my computer and this blog.  Nobody else.  So actually I am back to step one - but with readers now that I cannot return a visit to any more.  That makes me sad, but until something changes in blogger I am stuck with it.So after thinking long and hard, I am going forward. Over time, if I am blocked from commenting because I am unable to prove I am not a robot ... I will unsubscribe.  I'll build another reading list of folks who use \"pop up commenting.\"  I have no choice. I want that 'give and take' of conversation back again. I don't want to visit your blog like a ghost and pass on without saying hello.  My reading list will be substantially smaller, I fear, because I think the default when a blog is built is \"embedded commenting.\"  But that will have to be OK. Starting again!I'll be back to blogging again soon."},

Three sweaters for me.This goal seems a little indulgent.  Three sweaters?  I have hand made sweaters and I seldom wear them.  There is always something that is not quite right about them.  But ... ever hopeful me, I will find the perfect pattern for me.  Here are my choices.Shibui Knits - Cirrus by Nancy O'Connell.  This is described as a poncho.  It is poncho-like.  It has a cowl neck, wide sleeves and a curved hem.  The pattern was a bit pricy ($10) but free if you purchased the Shibui Knits yarn.  Unfortunately that yarn was well over $200 to purchase and I was pretty sure I had just the right yarn in my stash.  Obviously, we shall see.  I usually get into trouble when I substitute yarns.  *sigh*. The yarn I have chosen is Brooks Farm Yarn Mas Acero in a black/gray/dark lavendar color ways - the colors have very short runs. Cirrus by Nancy O'ConnellHarley by Jenny Williams.  I purchased the yarn this pattern for different sweater 2 or 3 years ago and discovered before I made the whole darn sweater ... the first pattern would not be right for me.  I picked this new pattern.  The yarn is by Purl SoHo and is 75% Extra Fine Merino and 25% Cashmere and it was expensive so I don't want it sitting in balls in my stash.  The color is called Tidepool and is not far different from the color in the picture - except that the Purl SoHo yarn color seems to look somewhat green in certain light, blue in another light and gray in yet another light. Interesting yarn.Harley by Jenny WilliamsLady Jane by Susan Mills.  I set my sights on this sweeter probably 10 years ago.  I am going to make it this year!  It is perfect for every day use.  Yarn choice still under consideration.Lady Jane by Susan MillsMignon by Justin Lorkowska - Sweater for my grand nephew's August birthday.I found this pattern for him before he was born and just loved it.  Originally on my 2018 list, I decided to wait to make a bigger size - 2T - so he has time to wear it longer for winter 2019-2020.  This is a top down designed pullover with Honeycomb panels.  The yarn I have is Cascade Yarns, 220 Superwash Sport in a seafoam blue.Mignon by Justin LorkowskaCreate 3 cowls - one for me, my daughter and my daughter-in-law - I have made many shawls but don't wear them as much as I thought I would.  No shawls this year - just cowls.  No patterns or yarns picked yet - but I have plenty of both and just need time to make decisions and put both together into kits ready to knit.Gnomes - these are so darn cute.  I have no choice but to make several of them.  Nothing but the pattern picked so far.TapestryI started a basic 'learn-to-do tapestry' sampler from a book in 2018.  I enjoyed it, but got swept away in children's projects ... and so the incomplete sampler sits idle.  I'd like to finish it and do an actual tapestry picture this year. So those are my plans for 2019!  I think the scope of the projects is probably way to large but oh well.    I have stopped looking at all pattern websites and yarn companies.  The more I look, the more I think I would like to do.  It never ends.Do you make craft plans?"},

{"title": "Rocky Point Disappearing", "date": "Sunday, December 9, 2018", "text": "Rocky Point, Long Island, New YorkAn Interesting and Beautiful PlaceThis is one of many cross stitch pieces given to my mom by her long time friendfrom Rocky Point. They were very good friends.In my recent visit to see my mom's life long friend in October (story here), I learned about Rocky Point, Long Island, New York, her chosen home. It has a dynamic and surprising history.A *Nor'Easter storm was coming through on theday of our visit.  The winds were blowingand it was very wet.  This street where my mom'sfriend lives was beautiful just the same.At 93 years of age mom's friend has many wonderful memories of Rocky Point.  During our visit she shared what Rocky Point was in her youth and what it is today.Her home - updated and expanded over the years fromthe original cottage of the 1930s.On the surface this community has a wooded 'settled' feeling with long established year round homes nestled within its boundaries.  Initially filled with summer cottages in the 1930s, now it has a mix of updated year-round structures and a few of the original summer cottages. This path leads down to the Long Island Sound.  At the path's head, the sign said\"No Tresspassing\" but my sister and I decided it didn't apply to us. 😆.If we hadn't taken the path, we would have missed the amazing views of the soundduring angry weather.But the 'settled' feeling is a false one.  Time and nature is making dramatic changes to this land. We were almost at the water's edge at this point.The picture doesn't do the angry waves justice!  Theypoured over that bulkhead.  The bulkhead is important.It holds down the erosion of the coast for the house located above the cliff. Right beside the bulkhead the erosion is huge.Walking back up the hill - my sister ahead of me.The wind was strong.During our visit we noticed a picture mounted on the wall.  It was a kind of map of the Rocky Point.  Shown in dark blue background with light print, it had the look of a surveyor's document.  Individual plots of land, roads and the shoreline of the Long Island Sound showed the scope of the area in the 1930s.  Our host explained that this picture showed Rocky Point as it was when her great aunt purchased the cottage (now a winterized and expanded home) we were standing in.  She pointed out exactly where we were figuratively in this map of the area.Now for the big disconnect.Standing at the front door of her home I could see a row of houses across the street that runs parallel to the rugged cliff coast line beyond.  Those houses back yards' end at the cliff's edge that drops off sharply into the Long Island sound.But standing looking at the long ago map of Rocky Point, I see that my current location is many parallel streets away from that cliff. All the land shown was divided into many many individual plots where houses resided.  That land, those roads, and those cottages are all gone!In fact, several houses just across the street were already considered 'Condemned' by the State.  And one house was gone .... off the cliff.  All that remained was the front yard and a road side mail box.In the fore front - the road my mom'sfriend lives on.  Behind that is asolitary mailbox.  Behind themailbox is a fence located in what usedto be the front yard of a house.The house is gone.Yes, my mom's friend lives in a house that used to be be far from the coast ... and now is exactly one street and one row of houses away from being cliff side.The supports of a house that fell off the cliff into the Long Island Sound.It was  Geology 101 for me.  Geology 101 talked about land changes in terms of hundreds of years - even thousands of years.  But changes demonstrated so dramatically and stunningly within the span of one life time ...  that chapter was not covered in my class.   When my mom's friend inherited the Rocky Point property in the 1960s she had the foresight to check with a geologist.  His assessment in the 1960s was that her property would last until the end of her life - but maybe not until the end of her children's lives.The story of a fast disappearing coast line - is hard to ignore when recognized over a very short period time.  Yes, this coastline has probably been receding for hundreds of years.  But would it have been so easily measured if man had not built right up to the shoreline back in the 1930s?  And would there actually be less erosion if accelerated global warming was not whipping up violent storms to pound on this coast?  And could man do something - like sand dunes seen in beach communities to slow the march of this destruction?The next day was BEAUTIFUL.  Fall colors still held onto the trees despite the winds that whipped at it.The pictures of this beautiful area do not do justice to the beauty and drama that is Rocky Point, Long Island. I am glad I got to see the splendor of this place - and the drama of it as well.  During our visit the area was experiencing a *Nor'easter.  This strong storm was churning the Sound and chipping away at the shoreline as it has done hundreds of times.  Even once the shoreline claims our host's home, there will still be many properties behind her that will still stand.  But as time passes each house will take its turn at being 'beach front' property ... until they aren't any more.The sky and the sea was beautiful. Just beyond the white fence, the cliff drops off.I am standing in a back yard of a condemned house -condemned because it will take its turn to fall intothe Sound.The quiet of the next day! Future years may not be quiet for this little house.But today, all is well.One last look at a yard - and property behindthe fence that is disappearing.It is just nature at work- relentlessly!* Nor'easters are usually accompanied by very heavy rain or snow, and can cause severe coastal flooding, coastal erosion, hurricane-force winds, or blizzard conditions. Nor'easters are usually most intense during winter in New England and Atlantic Canada (definition from Wikipedia.)"},
{"title": "The Quiet Holiday - A Gentle Reminder", "date": "Thursday, December 6, 2018", "text": "As we approach the Christmas season, it is time for a gentle reminder.  Amidst the flood of holiday cheer and good will, there are those who may desire to skip the merrymaking.  The reasons are many.  A first holiday without a loved one or friend, serious health or money problems, and some, like myself, have memories around this time of year that are like scars over a wound.Of course you can't miss the commercial signs of Christmas.   The festive decorations in red and gold and green that cover shopping malls, homes, even cars ... seasonal music pouring into our ears, trees gayly decorated and beautifully wrapped gifts.  TV shows with charming holiday stories that all have a happy ending.  The societal prompts are everywhere - \"Be Happy!\"And yet ... Be Happy ...  Well, it has not been my response for many years to this holiday.  I make an effort to keep those sad reflective feelings at arms length around others in December.  But I feel the need to remind all on behalf of the \"Less Than Happy Club\" of which I am a member, that Christmas is not always a joy filled.My memories ...shared with you as a one example of the struggle some havethis time of year. Old memories ... as an elementary teacher pulled suddenly from my students,  .... standing in the school secretary's office decorated in reds and greens and golds, hearing mom's voice say over the phone the words \"dad just died,\"  tears,  confused faces of my second graders as I left them with a substitute in the middle of their holiday party ... waiting outside for my husband to pick me up, disbelief, seeing another staff member, arms filled with holiday cheer for a staff party, smiling and happy, and seeing the smile fade as I said the words ...  and within days standing at mom's side in a funeral home that was decked out with the reds and the golds and the greens of the season, helping to pick out a casket while Christmas music filtered softly through the speakers, hearing her whisper, \"I hope he knew that I loved him.\"The date was December 23, 1970.  I was 23.  I remember it like it was yesterday.Years pass.  The holiday subtly changed.  Bad things do happen when the world seems happy.  New to me at age 23.  Children were born, memories were put aside with purpose and with determination.  Some joy seeped back in.Fresher memories ... the same music, the same reds, the same golds, the same greens of the season, the same joy in the air ...  except it was December and my 85 year old mom moved in assisted living.  Christmas was hard.  And the next year was harder, always harder.  I began to dread the signs of the approaching happy season.  My mantra  ... I will get passed this - then 'normal' can return. Until Christmas 2014 came.  The same of everything was back.  Again.  Music, greens, golds and reds, decorated trees, gifts.  All the same - except three days before Christmas a new image was added ... a nurse sitting me down ... the words \"your mother is dying.\"  Regrets expressed, only a few days left, comfort drugs for her, can I do anything for you or your family. Truly, what little joy of the season in me was sucked out. December 28, 2014 she died.  I was 67.  I know that was 4 years ago,but it is really only yesterday in my mind.Scars upon scars. The 'happy' season is different for me now.I accept the memories now.  They are a part of who I am.  Not something to be swept aside.  It is an anniversary of a sort that two important people passed from this life during the happiest time of the year.  And one life, mine, changed because of it.My experience isn't unique.  Nursing homes report a high incidence of death at Christmas.  And the troublesome problems of life continue - missing a loved one, financial problems, health problems, emotional upheaval - despite the constant unending message of December to \"Be Happy.\"So remember as you move through this month some folks are struggling.  They may still smile and laugh and appear to be engaged in the wonder that is the Christmas season.  But they may be wearing a mask.  I know that I do.Be kind.  Be understanding.  Be tolerant of their need for space from the season.  Be happy yourself.  But remember, sometimes 'happy' is not the goal for some - sometimes just a quiet peaceful holiday is all that can be achieved.And that is ok."},
{"title": "Observations of Living in a 55+ Community", "date": "Wednesday, November 28, 2018", "text": "Do you ever look back at a major life decision and wonder if you would have made the same decision if you had known then what you know now?After 2 years of living in a 55+ community, I have made some interesting observations about this style of living and our decision to move here.When this community was being built in 2007, it was a very popular option for interested seniors.  I understand from some original owners that there was a waiting list for units.  New owners initially fell between ages 55-65 ... younger seniors.  All moved in within a year or two of each other as the development was built.  All had similar motivations and were inspired to make this new style of living successful for themselves.  Newsletters, committees, social activities, and active board of directors (some report an over active board that ruled with an iron fist) were the norm.  Naturally there was an excitement in wanting to make your \"new home\" perfect.That is what I briefly know about this communities early years!I have impressions of how this community has changed over time and what it is now. We moved into this condo when it was about 14 years old.  When we were searching for a condo we looked for specific things: an evaluator, less living space to manage, lower living costs, a reasonable condo fee, pet friendly, geographically close to our kids, and a property that was cared for and financially viable.  We weren't looking for some of the more typical considerations - amenities like organized social activities, business center services, or exercise equipment.  In fact, we were initially not even looking for a senior community and we were looking for places without those typical amenities.  The fact there is no newsletter or committees or social calendar is just fine with us. we did not want to pay for things we would not use - those amenities comes with a high dollar price tag in the form of elevated condo fees.  Nothing is free.Some of you were readers of my blog as I struggled with the decision to move and to find the right place.  You might remember just how emotionally draining and exhausting the whole process was.  I have some observations on the pluses and minuses of the decision I made two years ago.  Plus: Ease of interior maintenance - since I am the one doing all the maintaining - this is important.  Minus: Vanilla is not my favorite flavor - I like variety.  I miss the mix of residents that we used to have - families with young children, singles, Halloween Trick or Treaters.Plus:  Definitly cheaper - a big plus.  We have an adequate retirement, but time and inflation can eat into that nest egg.  Expenses are stable here with no large jumps in the condo fee.  No external issues to manage like when the roof leaks or the snow falls.  Minus:  Less control over making sure the exterior is repaired and maintained.  Property ages.  Halls need painting, hall carpet needs replacing ... now at 16 years old, this property needs on going maintenance. Plus:  Quieter - neighbors are more considerate of how they live their lives and how it might impact others than in more vibrant younger communities. Minus:  Moving after 55 - at least for me - means leaving behind a place called home of 30 years.  That same feeling will be unlikely here. Plus:  More time for me and my personal pursuits.  Minus:  Some folks who live here are aged past the point of being independent safely.  That is an issue everywhere, but when you live in a senior community, it is more evident.Plus:  You can build new friendships among your peers when you are surrounded by your peers!  I have been very lucky to make several friends in this community.  Nothing is perfect - every style of living after a certain age carries some concerns.  We certainly could not have anticipated some of my minuses and pluses when making this decision two years ago.  But despite the minuses - I am still content with our choice.It is nice to know that! Glad that looking back didn't result in regrets!"},
{"title": "Making Plans", "date": "Friday, November 16, 2018", "text": "Making PlansThat's where November always leads me.Now, make no mistake.  These are not resolutions!  I have taken the stand to 'resolve' nothing!!  Especially at the beginning of a new year.Resolutions typically involve something personal like losing weight, or exercising more, or sticking to a budget.  They seem to focus on improving something about yourself.  I have personal goals like this but I have moved away from hanging the start date for these goals to the first of the year.  It never works for me.But November ... that's different! I feel the pull to make plans for the next year - sort of like a to-do list for the coming year.  I guess it is a lot like what gardeners do in February, as they scour the seed catalogs ear marking pages, making lists and placing orders for their spring-summer gardens. Its a plan, not a resolution.Over the last few weeks I have been thinking and planning and organizing to make two significant projects (from different sides of my life) happen in 2019.Project from the fun side of my life:A Knitting PlanKnitting Projects in 2019:  I am building a list, and creating the yarn and pattern kits in preparation for next year's knitting. Doing this will mean I won't be swallowed up by only kids projects (as much fun as they are) - finally getting to a sweater for myself two years in the waiting.  Slim down the patterns:  How many patterns does one person need!  To find any inspiration in that pile of paper is impossible. Time to recycle most of it.My yarn:  It owns me ... I don't own it.  Recently I tried to find some yarn in that avalanche of skeins and it was so frustrating.  Far from fun.  I have to find a way to own that yarn again - and not the other way around. Project from the business side of my life:A Hold-It-All-Together PlanAs with most couples, my husband and I shared the responsibilities of our married life for almost 50 years.  As my husband's disability has grown, the sharing has shrunk.  Slowly his to-dos got added to my to-dos ...  and along the way new to-dos out of necessity also got added to my list. At the same time, however, my aging brain is saying -\"Lady, you are getting older - and so is your brain - AND you have already filled me up - AND there is no room to add more stuff -ANDI am retired, you know!!\" So what to do, what to do.Enter my invention -My Book of Many Things!Ok, this is not exactly my invention.  It is a carved out piece of The Bullet Journal method.  Here is a second link on Bullet Journaling.  What I think I need to do is extract just the pieces of The Bullet Journal system I need to help track all the details that I don't want to store in my brain.  These details are not to-dos.  They are more the reference materials of my life.Lost?  Let me explain further.See, my life isn't as crazy daily or even weekly as it used to be - so the calendar portion of the bullet journal system is not very useful to me.  That calendar feature was built on the idea of  'to-dos' lists that could be juggled and adjusted daily within your bullet journal.  That calendar system is great, by the way, and I used it when we moved.  It saved my butt as I independently juggled downsizing, purchasing property, moving, and selling property - all in a 6 month period!  I kiss the ground the inventor walks on because kept me from totally de-compensating during a stressful life event.  But now life is more peaceful and my to-dos don't consume me like they used to.  I keep a wall calendar for appointments, and daily 3x5 cards with to-dos.  That simple process works for me now. But there is a sea of information that needs a place to reside outside my brain.  It is sort of the reference material of my life - the big picture stuff - the future road maps - beyond just cleaning the toilet today or dusting the bricka-bracka tomorrow!  Archiving it in writing into a single place is the plan I am working on. That single place is my Book of Many Things 'cause that is what it will hold.So what kind of information am I talking about.  Here is my initial collection:Knitting List for 2019List of packing items when traveling or off for the weekend.  I hate building that list every time I pack a suitcase.Budget Plans and schedulesBlog post ideasLog ins and passwordsKnitting Group RotationMovies/Books Titles - what I have read or what I plan to readFuture purchases or wish listsBirthdays/AnniversariesMenu plans for big celebrationsDoctors and their demographicsRight now this stuff is scattered in a number of places.  There isn't a real logic to its location.  And sometimes they are housed in locations that made sense when I did it, but they no longer make sense - and I can't find it.I am still sorting out if I want a bound book or if I want a 3 ring binder.  A bound book has more appeal to me.  My life has a lot of 3 ring binders in it and I don't think the ability to insert or replace pages is a big enough draw to pull me away from the idea of a bound book.  I like the permanency of a bound book.  And the Bullet Journal System is built on a bound book.Obviously the Knitting and the Book of Many Things projects need more thought and planning.I am in the planning part of this process now ... 'cause it is November, and it is what I apparently do in November!!"},
{"title": "Not a Minimalist", "date": "Friday, November 9, 2018", "text": "I am greatly inspired by the movement called Minimalism.  I have read books and followed blogs by folks who espouse minimalism ... those who describe what it looks like and what it doesn't look like ... those who have used broad brush stokes to explain it - like \"Less is More\" and those who nail down the concept to the point of how to organize your sock drawer. Seriously, I love that minimalism defies definition.Plug the word minimalism into any online search engine and a plethora of links and titles pop up.  So I won't bother to enumerate titles I have read and enjoyed.  If you link the word \"frugal\" to minimalism in your mind, I will say most definitely, it is not the same thing at all.For me minimalism is simply reaching of \"enough.\"  Enough for your needs - be they physical or emotional or mental.  Moving beyond \"enough\" or more than your needs is not a minimalist.So why do I even mention this at all.When I discovered the minimalist movement maybe 10 years ago, I strived for that.  Or I should say I strived for magazine equivalent of minimalism.   The magazine equivalent looks something like:All surfaces clear of brick-a-bracka.Drawers and closets with space to spare.More visible floor space.Less stuff on the walls.No duplication of items.No items stored for some distant point in time when I 'might' need them.Initially it was an astounding goal to strive for in a household that was more than one person and was filled with the possessions of several family members - possessions built over their life times.  But no matter.  I strove for that.  And as the clutter began to clear - I could feel that sense of well being that has been described over and over again by others.Then when the dust cleared after mom's death, and it was just my husband and I, I really stepped up the push to removed in some way all the stuff that was weighing me down.  Due to need, I even extended that to how much living space did we (a retired couple) really need to be happy and safe - ending in our move to condo living.Broadly stated, over 10 years we probably reduced our environment baggage by 75%.  But still ... I didn't fit that 'magazine image' of a minimalist. And then I realized that maybe I was a minimalist after all.  I had reach my goal of \"enough.\" Then I walked into my yarn room.  Believe me when I say, I am far beyond 'enough' when it comes to my crafts.  And then I checked my pantry.  I am a food hoarder.  The pantry is always bulging and I can't seem to get that under control. I am not a minimalist.  I am a person who continues to strive for 'enough' in all things and although that state of being doesn't have a label like \"Minimalist\" ... I am ok with that. Or maybe I should just make up my own term.I am an \"Enough-ist.\" Hmm ... It doesn't roll of the tongue does it!? I am open to suggestions!!"},
{"title": "Lessons in Friendship and a Trip", "date": "Friday, November 2, 2018", "text": "In the last years of my mom's life I learned many end-of-life lessons.  As her body and mind failed her, she showed how hard aging can be, how the little steps in \"letting go\" of independence can drain your enjoyment of life, and how her love of family continued despite all the loss.The lesson of friendship, however, I learned from someone else. A true friendship doesn't fade away because our lives change, or we move away or we get old, or our brain dies slowly.  Recently I learned that even if we die - that link of lasting friendship and affection is not lost ... unless we intentionally let it go.  Mom's friend of 65 years had no intention of letting go of anything.  I learned something about friendship from her one weekend in October.When my mom's friend called me and invited my sister and I to visit her (almost 4 years after mom's death), I was blown away by the invitation.  She lived far away and had limited mobility and mom's dementia removed mom mentally from her friends.  But mom's friend managed to keep connected with me over the course of mom's last months.  Since mom's death, that friendship connection remained strong within her friend - wanting to know about our growing family ... and mom's great grand babies! We were thrilled to get the invitation.Our visit would take us into Long Island, NY by train.  I love train travel.  My sister and I looked upon it as an adventure.  Thankfully my sister is a seasoned traveler so she took control of working out the details of travel.The train turned out to be great fun.  Who knew they served food and drinks in a dining car!  We were several train cars away from the dining car, so we walked (read: staggered - train movements, you know) through another car I have never heard of - the Quiet Car!  Apparently in the Quiet Car - you must be quiet.  Ha!  A Quiet Car seemed like an odd thing to find in a bouncy noisy rocking mode of travel.  Each car has a toilet - thankfully.  The seats in the train provide a pull down tray and reclining options just like riding on a plane.  But the similarities between train and air travel stopped there.  Air travel requires so many security checks before you can even board the plane.  Train travel?  Not one security check.  Sort of like riding a bus - you have your ticket and you just get on - and don't tarry, 'cause that train is rolling out of the station with or without you. The highlight of our trip was seeing Mom's friend again.  She had retired many years ago to a beautiful area of Long Island called Rocky Point.  At 93 years of age, she is still as sharp as ever.  Our conversations with her were interesting and animated.  She had her share of health issues that limited her mobility, but make no mistake ... she had her mind!My sister and I prepared photo album of our grand babies as a gift for her.  We also included several pictures of mom during her last years just before the dementia totally took her from us.  She loved the book and we heard from her daughter that she shared it with others. Riding home on the train after our visit left lots of time for thought and reflection.   I couldn't help but marvel at how rich my mom's friendship life was with this woman.  Mom's friend was always a fire ball of a personality.  My earliest memories of her (I was probably age 7), are of a woman who was strong of body and mind, energitic and very generous of herself.  My mom was always a calm accepting kind of a personality who understood more than she ever said.  Together they complimented each other so well.  But I was also sad because mom was not here now to enjoy the friendship they had cultivated over a lifetime.We plan to do our share of staying connected with this wonderful woman ... especially now that we know that she has not let go of her friendship with our mom.  Not even death can take away what they had.  The album we gave her had lots of open spaces.  We will keep her current with pictures and notes - and we will take her up on her invitation to return for another visit - probably in the spring. Some lessons in life ... well ... they brought tears to my eyes more than once that weekend.Next ... a little pictorial of Rocky Point Long Island - the beauty and the reality of living there."},

Old private family cemeteries can be unusual depending on where you live in the country.  Development on the east coast of the US, however, is invasive.  I cringe at the thought of how many old graves  sites have been lost in time or just paved over with the steam roller of developers. Many original Howard County farm homes dot the landscape within Columbia, a planned city that is 50 years young.   On occasion you will find a small family cemetery attached to one of these original properties.  In fact, when I lived in my former neighborhood of King's Contrivance, Columbia, there was one such house right in the middle of our development - with a small attached graveyard.  What is really amazing is the fact that any of these small cemeteries remain in this area ... in spite of the march of modernization and development.Beautiful iron works The Whipp Garden Cemetery:The Whipp Garden Cemetery is located in Ellicott City, adjacent to Columbia - in Howard County, Maryland  The cemetery sits in a well establish housing development called St. John's Community, right off St. John's Road.  I vaguely remember catching a brief glance at this cemetery as I sped past in my car during its neglected period prior to 1987.  I remember thinking it was sad to see its decline.  But I also remember years later seeing people working in that cemetery. Today, I finally stopped!I was moved by all I saw and learned!This one acre plot of land was established as a cemetery in 1833, yet some gravestones were from 1820s.  William Whipps bought the land in 1855 for $73.25, and the deed noted the presence of an \"an old graveyard.\"  The Whipps were well-known farmers and merchants of the day who also served as blacksmiths at Oakland Manor -- now Oakland Mills in Columbia.  The last burials at this site were in 1915.The Whipps burial ground was always just a little country cemetery, not affiliated with any church.  In the later 1800s, burial lots were sold to other families.  Over time the cemetery was forgotten, over grown, and suffered from vandalism.Not much thought was given to this cemetery until 1984 when building stakes went up in the weeds and bulldozers began clearing the brush!  A group of neighbors - members of the St. Johns Community Association, Inc. led by Barbara Seig - decided that this little wooded cemetery had suffered enough neglect and abuse. Thank God for concerned citizens who saw a wrong and took steps to make it right.Marker with no writing on it.Restoration began in 1987 by the community association assisted by the descendants of the Whipps family, Boy Scouts and Girls Scouts, area garden clubs and neighborhood volunteers.  It is now owned by The Friends of the Whipps Cemetery and Memorial Gardens, Inc., a non-profit organization.This precious gift of a beautiful old cemetery for the residents of Howard County is maintained by Master Gardeners who plant and maintain heritage and native species in a variety of different settings, interspersed by pathways, benches, iron works and tombstones. The plants are typical of Maryland in the 1800s.I will visit again.  I am sure that the face of this special place changes with the change of seasons ...Just as it has changed over its long history.For now that face shows beauty, care and reverance for the history of thissmall one acre cemetery.Here's hoping it's future is bright.** NoteInformation about the Whipps Garden Cemetery was pulled directly from 3 sources - A brochure created by The Friends of The Whipps Cemetery and Memorial Gardens, Inc., A Self-Guided Stroll through the Gardens booklet and their web site."},
{"title": "Blogger Commenting Issues", "date": "Monday, October 22, 2018", "text": "Just a 'housekeeping' observation about Blogger - the Blog Platform that I use to house and write my blog ...Recently I received a private email from one of my long time blog friends, Michelle.  She writes at Boulderneigh Blog - and you should stop in for a visit - especially if you love sheep and dogs and cats and horses and gardening and photography and knitting and spinning.  Yes, it wore me out just to write all that ... she is a very busy lady. She was having a new problem commenting on my blog.  She had other blog readers/friends who also reported similar problems with Blogger and suggested a fix for that problem.  I took her advice and the problem on my blog disappeared - I think.  She, at least, can now comment.If you notice similar problems on your blog or other blogs ... on Blogger, here is the fix I made:Change comments from \"Embedded\" to \"Pop Up Window\" on your blog.Not to get too technical ... but I did notice a minor change on my end of the blogging experience as the blog author using \"Pop Up Window.\"When comments were set to \"Embedded,\" I could visit my blog without signing in, and respond to individual comments using a 'Reply' option button available after every individual comment.  Now that 'Reply' button is gone.  Now that I am set for \"Pop Up Window,\" the only way I can reply to comments on my blog is to leave another new comment  (like I am an external reader) and prove to my blog that I am not a Robot.  But I can't reply individually any more.  Odd.Not a big deal.But it does seem like the Blogger Platform has experienced a series of problems in the last year.  It does make me nervous.  I would hate to start all over again on a new platform (with their unknown problems) and/or loose my history here.Anyway, let's hope that the Blogger problems are now under control."},
{"title": "Binge Watching", "date": "Sunday, October 21, 2018", "text": "I watch a lot of shows on Netflix and Amazon Prime in the evenings.  I seldom watch anything in \"real\" time (beyond Dancing With the Stars and America's Got Talent) preferring to binge watch show after show of a series until I reach the last season.  This evening TV time is also my knitting time - and a quiet space when I control the TV remote and the choices. Thought I would share some of the titles I have watched and my impressions.24Counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) fights the bad guys of the world one day at a time.  With each episode unfolding in real time, \"24\" covers a single day in the life of Bauer each season.   (9 seasons with 24 episodes per season)You know, I am really not into counterterrorism topics, but this show is ACTION, ACTION, ACTION.  Non-stop action and you simply cannot pull your eyes away from the screen.  I completely enjoyed the series.  Sorry it was over.  Rating:  A++++Tom Clancy's Jack RyanFormer US Marine, Jack Ryan, now is a up and coming CIA Analyst.  He is thrust into his first dangerous field assignment.  One season only available at this point but I understand another season is in the works.It was ok.  I enjoyed some of Tom Clancy's books and the Jack Ryan character.  But will I seek out another season ... maybe.  Rating:  CDesignated SurvivorAs a lower-level cabinet member, Tom Kirkman (Kiefer Sutherland) is catapulted into the Oval Office as President by a devastating attack on the night of the State of the Union address.  Two seasons available.I think the first season was pretty good - and the second season was ok.  I am a fan of Kiefer Sutherland.    This show was cancelled.  There is no third season.   Rating: C+Suits - currently watchingBig time Manhattan corporate lawyer Harvey Specter and his team are launched into the play for power.  Eight seasons - 16 episodes each season.I will admit I had no real interest in a legal themed show.  I started watching so I could find out who this Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, is/was.  The show is very good, interesting, funny at times and the characters have grown on me a bunch.  The one thing I know after watching this show is that I could NEVER be a lawyer.   The show is still in production.   Rating: A+AbsentiaAfter being declared dead in absentia, an FBI agent must reclaim her family, identity and innocence when she finds herself the prime suspect in a string of murders - 1 season, 10 episodesThe draw for this show was actress Stana Katic who plays the missing FBI agent.  She was the star of another TV series called Castle that I enjoyed.  This show was a little brutal at times to watch but good enough to watch all the 10 episodes. I think a second season is planned for 2019.  I probably won't seek it out when it is released.  Rating: C3 Wives 1 Husband Documentary series offers a rare access to a fundamentalist community of 15 Mormon families that live in the desert of Utah.  They are polygamists - the practice of marriage to multiple people at once.    This series examines the personal politics of courtship, how to behave correctly in front of sister wives, complicated sleeping arrangements, and also acts as a catalyst to a wider selection of relationships, love, family and faith in the contemporary United States.   4 episodesI admit I watched these 4 episodes mostly because I was curious.  I am drawn to reading books and watching shows of different life styles.  On the surface, the documentary answers many questions about the lives of this segment of our society.  Just like any other small and different group (Amish, Hasidic Jews, etc.) there is curiosity, mis-information and, at times, fear.  Watching this show I felt some questions were never addressed:  how do they support such large families.  The family in the documentary had anywhere from 12-19 children, 3 wives and 1 husband.  At a minimum, the funds to feed and clothe that many people were not explained.  It could also be argued that so many dependents of one man could not be an easy life - stressful even.  I could not see myself accepting any of that, but I wasn't raised as a fundamentalist Mormon as these people were.  And even with their upbringing, they had some problems with this life style.  It was a very interesting show. Rating: BSo what shows have you been watching?"},

{"title": "Grand dog sitting", "date": "Monday, October 15, 2018", "text": "So I am watching these two sweet dogs this week - my grand dogs.  Ragnar, Rags for short, is the white English Bulldog on the left, and Olivia, Liv for short, is the hound mountain dog mix on the right.  Rags came to us as a puppy.  Olivia was a rescue coming to us at approximately the age of 2.  They are buds.This week my son and his wife are out of town and I am their regular dog sitter.  At times in the past I have kept them at the condo with marginal success.  They are big dogs with lots of strength.  Together they can easily overpower me if they are on leashes.  Individually I can manage them.  But they are really 'house' dogs - not 'condo' dogs - and they don't always understand the noise limitations of living so close to other people.  And they are used to their large fenced in yard - as pictured above - leash walking is sometimes hard.   So I decided to 'live' at their house with them and come back to the condo to visit with my husband each day. And usually, dog sitting at their house is uneventful ... except when it is not!  Like Saturday.Saturday I arrived at the house.  My son and his wife had already left.  The dogs were waiting excitedly for me.  A full week of Grandma - who spoils them, and loves them, and gives them treats for just breathing!! To blow off some of their steam at my arrival, I opened the kitchen slider and let them run in their yard.  I proceeded to get myself unpacked.At some point I opened the door and called for them.  Rags came running from somewhere deep in the yard at full gallop.  He raced for his water bowl.  He was alone.  No Liv.  I called for her again.  Nothing.  No worries.  She probably was fully engaged with a delicious scent she could not let go of (part hound after all) and I let Rags back out in the yard again. I walked along the back of the house to the far side of the yard - calling her name, stepping carefully to avoid poop and dodging Rags who was still exuberant.  I didn't see her.  She didn't seem to be anywhere in the yard.  A small little voice of worry crept into my mind.I turned and started walking carefully back the way I came, looking in the bushes and up the hill.  I was about halfway back when I realized that Rags was circling me and running back to where we had been - over and over again.  Hmm... I turned around and walked back.When I got to the end of the yard, I noticed that Rags was walking behind a shed and running back out again.  It didn't take long for me to discover this ...There she was!  Obviously under the shed and stuck!  She had squeezed in a small spot closer to the other side and could not figure out how to back out.  Actually she may have had very little room to make any adjustments except to go forward. And, of course, Rags was so frustrated because Liv was 'having all the fun' and he couldn't get his chunky little body in that space.  (Liv normally is the brains of the pair - but she didn't show good judgement this time.). I had to take Rags back into the house - because he was 'helping' just too much.And then I had to dig her out.  When we were done - she could squeeze out and she was very joyful.  Grandma had saved her.  The space, however, looked like this.Just too inviting for another visit.  One episode like this was enough for me.  So I spent some time lifting and repositioning some cement blocks in that space.That little episode took a few years off my life.  I don't have that many to spare.  But I knew I was getting her out, even if I had to call Rescue 911 - and have the fire fighters come.  When we were done with this little escapade, the sun was starting to set.Olivia has proven to be an exceptionally smart dog in many ways since we got her.  Her vocabulary is impressive.  She is very careful around my legally blind husband and waits patiently for me when she and I are going down my condo hall steps together.But this day, she let her 'hound brain' take over!!Love her bunches!!Even the hound parts."},

Pierce", "date": "Thursday, October 11, 2018", "text": "I don't know how many of you watched the recent Senate hearings in the confirmation process for the new Supreme Court Justice.  The interviews and the resulting outcome was so discouraging and sad that I thought to avoid any mention on my blog.  This is not a political blog, after all,  and I don't want to offend readers whose opinions are different from mine. But then I read the words of Charles P. Pierce on Facebook.  Those words are worth repeating here.  I hope you feel they are worth reading.I must warn you ... it won't make you feel any better!\"In my life, I have watched John Kennedy talk on television about missiles in Cuba. I saw Lyndon Johnson look Richard Russell squarely in the eye and and say, \"And we shall overcome.\" I saw Richard Nixon resign and Gerald Ford tell the Congress that our long national nightmare was over. I saw Jimmy Carter talk about malaise and Ronald Reagan talk about a shining city on a hill. I saw George H.W. Bush deliver the eulogy for the Soviet bloc, and Bill Clinton comfort the survivors of Timothy McVeigh's madness in Oklahoma City. I saw George W. Bush struggle to make sense of it all on September 11, 2001, and I saw Barack Obama sing \"Amazing Grace\" in the wounded sanctuary of Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina.These were the presidents of my lifetime. These were not perfect men. They were not perfect presidents, god knows. Not one of them was that. But they approached the job, and they took to the podium, with all the gravitas they could muster as appropriate to the job. They tried, at least, to reach for something in the presidency that was beyond their grasp as ordinary human beings. They were not all ennobled by the attempt, but they tried nonetheless.And comes now this hopeless, vicious buffoon, and the audience of equally hopeless and vicious buffoons who laughed and cheered when he made sport of a woman whose lasting memory of the trauma she suffered is the laughter of the perpetrators. Now he comes, a man swathed in scandal, with no interest beyond what he can put in his pocket and what he can put over on a universe of suckers, and he does something like this while occupying an office that we gave him, and while endowed with a public trust that he dishonors every day he wakes up in the White House.The scion of a multi-generational criminal enterprise, the parameters of which we are only now beginning to comprehend. A vessel for all the worst elements of the American condition. And a cheap, soulless bully besides. Watch him again, behind the seal of the President of the United States. Isn't he a funny man? Isn't what happened to that lady hilarious? Watch the assembled morons cheer. This is the only story now.\" ~Charles P.

{"title": "Circle of Friends", "date": "Tuesday, October 9, 2018", "text": "Yesterday was my knitting group meeting!It was my turn to host!  As I prepared I got to thinking ...Social contacts ...  in the bullet list of a healthy life style for seniors, a circle of friends should be #1 - ahead of medications and shots, ahead of a healthy diet and an exercise regimen.  Ahead of just about everything.  After all ... who really knows what contributes to a long life - but whatever minutes we have in that life, it should include regular time with friends.I didn't read that idea in a book or hear it on a TV show.  I watched it play out in the real lives of 3 elderly relatives.  Friends would move away or die and the social circle would shrink until sometimes there was no one left.  I remember my mother-in-law talking about her 'friends:' the cab driver who took her to the grocery store every week, the grocery store checker whose line she always waited for so she could 'visit,' the hair dresser who gave her a wash and set every week for years.  These folks were her 'friends' toward the end of her life.  It made me sad and a little uncomfortable knowing just how common this situation is.So I have made it a priority to take a different path as I got older.The second Monday of every month 6 of us get together and knit for about 3 hours ... well, it is more like knit, laugh, snack, share .... repeat!  We take turns hosting this group in our homes.  We make time for each other.Our small group was drawn together by a share interest ... knitting.  The idea of a private knitting circle was birthed through a public knitting circle that I frequented for many years.In 2010 I joined a new local drop-in group called Columbia Sip and Knit.  When I joined there were only 7  members.  The group met in public places and was open to all.  Because it was held in a public place, folks passing by would often stop and talk with us.  Over time the membership grew from those casual encounters.  Initially we had only one meeting option a week.  Last time I checked the membership stats for that group have grown to over 1000 and there are 5 or 6 choices of meetings each week - different times and locations - something to suit any schedule.  The growth of this group was directly related to the growing popularity of knitting over the last 20 years.My first Tuesday morning knitting group in 2010.Early on I volunteered to be the organizer of a Tuesday morning session. I believe that group still meets at a local restaurant.Beautiful days in our local shopping center court yard.Three years ago I got restless.  I wanted different things from my knitting group experience.  I wanted stability - not new faces every week.  I wanted true friendships - not acquaintances.  I wanted to develop these friendships into lasting relationships - where not only light casual conversation happened, but where serious and sometimes sad sharing could be safely expressed.  A circle of friends that were committed to each other, made time for each other and not just committed to knitting.I reached out to another member and shared my idea for this new group.  She felt the same way and before you knew it, we had identified 8 members.  All were excited to start anew within a private framework.That was 3 years ago!  We have shrunk from 8 to 6 members when 2 of our group moved out of state.  But 6 is good number and we are open to new faces should the opportunity present itself.I pondered all this as I was setting out the munchies for our gathering yesterday.  Thinking back to our beginning I realized how well it has turned out.  We care about each other - we have shared many things sitting around the kitchen table knitting and we have developed a support system of sorts.I think it is still evolving and who knows what the future holds.  But a circle of caring friendships is as important to my wellbeing as taking that morning vitamin or going for a daily walk."},
{"title": "Camping in August", "date": "Sunday, October 7, 2018", "text": "So ... did you picture me out in the wilderness, sitting by a tent where I slept on the ground in a sleeping bag, swatting at bugs, cooking over a fire, pooping in an outhouse or in a hole in the ground, grubby, hot and sweaty in the humid August heat of Maryland?  Be honest - you did, didn't you.Even my son's dogs, Olivia and Ragnar, look on in disbelief at thethought of their 'grandmother' camping. In fact they do not see themselves camping either!Silly person!Give me a nice hotel room with a balcony over looking a lovely cared landscaping or a comfortable arm chair set by a roaring fire in the lobby with a hot drink by my side and knitting in my lap enjoying the comforts of the 21st century.But I did take a weekend to ride down with my son's family tosee their version of camping.The trip to Southern Maryland does take you throughsome lovely wooded areas.  But no stoppingto set up a tent.My son checking the camper before he releases \"the hounds.\" They appear to be supervising.Obviously, this is not their first trip!Their version of camping falls somewhere between the 'true believers' sitting in a tent and the folks like myself who like the enhanced version of camping out in a 4 star hotel with room service.  Their version of camping takes place at Dennis Point Marina in Southern Maryland, where other 'campers' of their type can be found.Although they have done this for more than 10 years, it never seems to grow old for them.  Recently they upgraded their camper from a fairly standard previously owned RV to a new 'Cadillac' version of an RV.  More space for 2 dogs and a baby and 2 adults to spread out.Their new home away from home.Check out their 'tent!!'Complete with air conditioning, heat and a central vacuum cleaner.The kitchen - I mean 'cook fire' - is fully equipped with a self cleaning oven, a nice size freezer and fridge, an oven and a microwave.  The sink is located on the center island. The view from their dining and kitchen window. They do have a fire place - electric - no smoke!  Lots of atmosphere.  Above the fire place is a large flat screen TV - and as you can see space to lay on the carpet and play with your baby.You can enjoy TV or just read a book in the comfy recliners.  There are two.  And there are two other couches that open into 2 queen size beds.  The master bedroom has a king size bed. And there is a ton of storage. Needless to say, there is no need for an outhouse.  Although I don't have pictures, there is a very lovely bathroom.  Sink, shower, and flush toilet - complete with toilet paper!  Very civilized.The 'neighborhood' is pretty cool as well.Lots of water views.Space to sit a spell.Just a lazy weekend doing nothing but relaxing.Even a place for kids to play, a pool, and an enclosed dog park.Cute street signs.And quality time spent with this little cutie!!Ah! Camping!!"},
{"title": "The Struggle is Real - Act 3", "date": "Friday, October 5, 2018", "text": "Just to review ...Act 1 can be found here.Act 2 can be found here.Pride is bad. Tantrums are worse.Yarn Bee Acrylic from Hobby Lobby is good for crochet - not so much for knitting.I am 4 months behind on my Christmas knitting.If you don't know what I am talking about - go back to the top of this list.Everybody with me now??Challenge 2 - pick the yarn! (again)Challenge 3 - pick the color! (again)Enter stage right ... Caron Simply Soft.  I love this yarn, used it many times in the past and for some unexplainable crazy reason I looked right past it on my shelf when deciding on a yarn for these sweaters.  My old friend ... Caron ... looked back at me from my yarn shelf.  A beautiful bright and cherry pink!  \"Pick me\" it said.  \"I have never failed you.\"Eskarina, girl, pink, perfect!I had one pink skein and the green pink variegated in stash.I purchased a second pink skein just to be sure I had enough.While at the store they had a complimentary variegated yarn that matched the pink that I like even more.Bright and cherry for a baby girl.The sweater requires 2 buttons.  And, oh, these buttons.They are just too cute for words.For my grand nephew I moved away from blue (too many bad memories there), to a sweet Burgundy.  I had many skeins of burgundy in my stash but a contrasting color needed to be obtained. I decided to go with a deep charcoal.The soccer ball buttons were a great find as well.The next step was to pick up my knitting needles and begin again.Much better. The stitches are even and any minor issues will definitely block out.And I love the color choices better than my first 2 tries.IAs you can see I am working on the collar now and the sleeves need to be finished. But I don't have to be a mile away from this sweater to enjoy the project.It amazes me that yarn can make such a difference in thequality of the stitches.  Not an error can be found - so far!  Ha!Just a few pictures to prove the point.I will be very proud to give this sweater away to myGrand Nephew.One final note about this sweater - it has not yet been blocked!  Remember, I blocked the other yarn/sweater twice - and could not get what Caron Simply Soft gave me without blocking.  Also the stitch pattern at the bottom has better definition.  With the other acrylic, the stitch patterning seemed to blur as the yarn became fuzzy with use.  (Fuzzy ... another problem with the Yarn Bee Acrylic that I didn't realize till I did the same sweater in Caron Simply Soft.)Thank you readers for your kind comments in the previous posts about my knitting efforts. My angst about the minor problems I couldn't get past (not one problem, mind you, but many) might have seemed puzzling.  I see that \"perfectest streak\" in others as they look at their creative works ... and I wonder how can they be so critical of themselves.  The fact is that experienced folks of any skill or art form are their own worst critics.  They know when a product they have produced is subpar.  I am no different.  I want my knitted gifts to others to be \"hand crafted\" and not \"home made\" in appearance.  There is a difference in my mind.I'll post finished pictures at some point, and after Christmas, pictures of the kids wearing their sweaters, but for now this play in 3 acts has a happy ending.  Challenge 4 is ahead - Complete Two Sweaters - my deadline for these is the end of October.  This is the easiest  and \"fun-ist\" of all the challenges for me.   The decision parts always make me crazy ... the doing parts are my happy place.I learned a few things from this exercise.Not all acrylics are equal.Yarn Bee acrylic was shiny and showy but splity and slippery - more chances to mess up. Caron Simply Soft behaves and feels and looks more like regular wool.A \"pretty face\" (i.e. Yarn Bee) does not always produce a pretty product.   Yarn Bee escaped the trash can this time. I had success with it previously and will save it for crocheted blankets and toys ... and maybe weaving. Note to self: Whiskey DOES works better than temper tantrums.  😁"},
{"title": "The Struggle Is Real - Act 2", "date": "Wednesday, October 3, 2018", "text": "Act 1 can be found here!Now just to review ...I am an experienced and skilled knitter with many years under my belt.  I like to think I am able to do absolutely anything if it involves yarn and needles!  In case you forgot ... pride is never a good thing!I seem to need that reminder frequently. My knitting can bring me down fast ...into childish temper tantrums!Sadly, we have not seen the last of those.Challenge 1 - pick a pattern.  DoneChallenge 2 - pick a yarn.  DoneChallenge 3 - pick a color.  Done I began knitting with GUSTO!  (read: happy dance!)I finished the boy's sweater first.  And from a distance, (say a mile away, ha!) it looks just fine.  Up close the story is different.  I noticed as I worked a number of little icky things in the knitted fabric I was creating.  Those icky things buggered at my need for perfection.  This was not a difficult pattern, the stitches should be perfect.  All of them.Something I did messed up these stitches.But I plowed on.  I ignored the little voice that said \"Are you going to accept that?\"  My silent answer to that question was - \"Oh, those little imperfections will block out.\"Ditto - minor for sure but user error! And it repeated in other places like a spreading plague!  Ugh!Usually that is a true statement.  Blocking - even blocking acrylic - can make uneven stitches wiggle into place and look normal.  But these samples I am showing are after blocking!  After blocking twice!  As I worked, the number of little irregularities grew, and my frustration grew with it.  But I persisted, because that little voice in my mind couldn't be right!These little tufts were put in by the manufacturerwhen they knotted the yarn.  This skein had a lot of manufacturer joins.Unfortunately this yarn was not easy to change colors or skeins smoothlyso I opted to keep the tufts rather than making a more ugly join by cutting the tufts out.After the blocking failed to fix the problem, I actually bought fabric glue to push those little oddities to the inside of the sweater and GLUE THEM OUT OF SIGHT!!   Yes, I had sunk that low.  But as I approached the sweater with the bottle of glue in my hand - my little voice was yelling, \"Are you out of your mind?  Glue? Seriously!!  Get real.\"I decided to let the boys sweater 'rest' awhile.  A 'time out' seemed like the best choice for me and this sweater.I began the girl's sweater - with a deliberate effort to make each and every stitch perfect - to avoid the inconsistencies that the boy's sweater had.  (Secretly, I had already decided to do his sweater over again.)  I was convinced that many of the problems in the boy's sweater were due to my carelessness. It had to be me because this yarn is so beautiful, and in many sections it looks just fine.  So it must be me!  That wasn't going to happen again. The girl's sweater would be perfect.  Each and every stitch perfect (damn it all!).  And, again, from a mile way, it is ok.But close up!  Not so much.  Careful careful careful stitches and still not perfect.  I blocked the girl's sweater at mid point in the knitting just to see what would happen to the stitches.  Not good enough!Clearly a knitter's problem - but I had been so so careful.Suddenly in a wave of irrational thought ... I HATE THIS YARN TOO!  I could feel a temper tantrum bubbling up.  Should I just throw it all away.(Breathe, breathe, breathe.)This could not be me.  It had to be the yarn.  (Breathe deeply, chug some aspirin, blink a few times to clear your sight.  Look at the girl's sweater again.  Crap!!)One and half sweaters completed, all that work and still not acceptable. (Walk around the condo a few times.  Put the girl's sweater in time out too.  Look at both again in the morning.  Keep breathing.)The next morning one sane thought filtered into my brain ... I realized that I crocheted with this yarn but never knitted with it - crochet is a very forgiving craft - hides a lot of imperfections.  Knitting - doesn't hide anything.  Knitting errors or irregularities have neon lights, big flashing arrows, and mega horns announcing each and every problem.  All knitters know this.(Crap, crap, crap.)This yarn did not deserve to be given away to unsuspecting knitters ... it should be thrown in the trash can!!   Right this minute.  (Temper tantrum in full display.  Trash can beckoned.  Think.  Go out for a walk until you can act rationally.  And breathe.)One thing is for sure!  I have not completed Challenge 2 (yarn) or 3 (color.)  I just have the pattern.  It is October, but I have made no further progress since May.(Maybe instead of breathing - I should try a shot of whiskey!)Next time ... ACT 3!"},
{"title": "The Struggle Is Real - Act 1", "date": "Monday, October 1, 2018", "text": "The Saga of the Christmas sweaters done in 3 Acts!I have been a knitter since 1997!  Over that time I have learned a few things - ok ...  a lot of things about yarn and patterns and needles and gauge and blocking and construction.  I am a knitting champ!You know what they say about pride coming before the fall!And knitting always takes me down a few pegs when I get too full of myself!Now that there are two babies in our family, my goal is to keep them outfitted in sweaters.  For this Christmas I thought it would be fun to make them matching sweaters.  Matchy-matchy ... you know!First Challenge: Find the knitting patternThe execution of that idea was marginally challenging when I tried to find a child's sweater pattern that would work for a boy and a girl. In the spring finally found a pattern called Boy's Sweater by Lisa Chemery.  At first look it seems best only for a boy.  Despite the pattern name, looking at other knitters' renditions of the sweater proved that it was perfect for a boy or a girl.photo credit: Ravelry.comDesigner sample.Photo credit: Ravelry.comSweater by UnicornJust small changes feminize a boyish pattern byanother knitter.Yea!!  Pattern obtained.  Check!Second Challenge: Select a yarnThis is an easy choice for me.  Since these sweaters are for kids ... acrylic seems like a no-brainer!   But in most of the samples people used wool.  I really feel wool is a poor choice for children under 2:  little people grow through those first few sizes very fast, wool could be an irritant for tender skin, and it takes more effort for the mom to care for wool.  And acrylics today have greatly improved over 20 years ago.  Acrylic it is.  And I have some perfect acrylic in my stash.Double Yea!! Yarn choice made without visiting a yarn store.  Check!Third Challenge: Choose colorsWhile this challenge isn't such a big deal for most people, it is a major hurtle for me.  I am color handicapped! Really.  It is true.But the color of the acrylic in my stash seemed perfect for matching sweaters.  Rusty orange for a boy and a sherbet orange for a girl.  Perfect I thought. The colors would work the male and the female.  I started the sweater for the boy - discovered I didn't like the rusty orange color after all or the knitted fabric that resulted.  Something about THIS specific acrylic was cursed.  This was my third effort to use this acrylic yarn in projects over 7 years, and all three attempts were a fail.   I had a small (ok, large) temper tantrum that NOTHING WORKED WITH THIS STUPID YARN.  I don't have a picture of the yarn or the knitting I attempted.  I gave that offending yarn away without giving it a second thought.  Truthfully ... I couldn't get it out of the house fast enough!Then I settled on an acrylic yarn that I LOVED while making the crochet Zookeeper's Blanket.  It is the house yarn for Hobby Lobby called Yarn Bee Soft Secret.  It is a luscious yarn for acrylic:  shiny, beautiful colors and so soft.  I had never used it for a garment but it looked perfect.  I berated myself for trying to use stash yarn that was 'cursed' for our babies.  But I didn't have colors that would work.  I went shopping!!Here are the two colors I bought for the girl sweater:  Blue Teal and Aqua!  My plan was to use the light color - Aqua - for the body and the darker color - Teal - for the trim like in the second picture above.Here are the two colors I bought for the boy's sweater: Denim and Light Denim.  The plan was to insert some sport stripes on the chest and the arms in the contrasting color.Aren't these colors wonderful?  They are so soft - they feel like cashmere!They literally shine!I could not wait to begin.Third Challenge:  Colors picked.  Check!Ready to start again. The knitting began!Next time ... the fail!"},

I am ready to charge the shore again.Funny that I should use a wave to symbolize my blogging cycle.  Guess the ocean is on my mind since I passed up an opportunity to visit the shore this week (not a topic for the blog.)  And yet, I have another wave symbol to share - a finished crochet project for my grand - daughter.  It is a Christmas present.  I'll share it here because I don't think anyone in my family follows my blog.The Zookeepers BlanketMy version of the Zookeepers BlanketEarlier this year I posted a story about a blanket that caught my eye.  I had to make it.  Just too cute. Check out the link to view the original blanket as made by the designer (I made changes.)The ElephantThe crocheted edge is called 'the wave' stitch and I am sure you can see why.That edge is not part of the original design.The Wave Edge StitchZipper Crochet Join - to connect the squares. This is a fiddly stitch, but so worth the effort.Finished - and it sure was fun to make.  CowWorking this project I discovered  (surprisingly) that I love working crochet.  Oh, it wasn't a 'fall in love' kind of love.  Not at all.  Actually it was more of a 'kicking and screaming' kind of love.LionLast year I began a crochet project for my Great-grand nephew.  It was a play set called The Island.  Very cute.   I discovered the pattern in 2016 and I had a rudimentary understanding of crochet.  So rudimentary that with every change of stitch I had to check how to do it in my crochet book.  In 2017 our family welcomed a new little guy - my great-grand nephew.  Finally I had someone to make The Island for.  I remember I complained the whole time I was making it about this and that, and that and this .... complain, complain, complain.  But I finished it.  It was a act of love for the first baby in our family.  And when it was done I was thrilled with it - and thankfully so was the recipient. But never again, I promised myself.  No more crochet!  Never again!  No, no, no.  Hanging up my crochet hooks after one successful project.You know what they say about the word 'never.'SnailMy son and daughter-in-law began growing a new little life in 2017.   During that time I discovered that almost all the really cute toys and blankets were made in crochet.  I resisted!  No, no, no.Lady BugThen I discovered The Zookeeper's Blanket.  I just HAD to do it *sigh*.  So I reluctantly dusted off my crochet hooks and started the blanket project with an attitude ... 'taking one for the team,' making the grand sacrifice, gritting my teeth and resolve ... after all, this was for my long awaited grand baby.  My own grand baby that I really gave up hope of every having!LobsterSomewhere in that project I began to enjoy crochet. SheepSo many reasons, that I won't enumerate here, but that crochet blanket began to come together with great speed.Jelly FishNow I am looking around for another crochet project!Does that mean knitting is taking a back seat to crochet?  Heresy!! Nothing could be further from the truth.That proof is a topic for next time.The Pig"},
{"title": "A Tapestry Weekend", "date": "Sunday, July 29, 2018", "text": "Ah, Sunday!  The end of another fun crafting weekend with family.  It is always sad when it is over, but the memories linger.  We sure do have fun.My cousin working on a tapestry project.This weekend was themed as a weaving weekend.  My sister and cousin are avid weavers.  By 'avid' I mean weaving is their primary craft over things like knitting and spinning.  And between the two of them, they have a large sampling of small, table top and floor looms.  The fabric they create is amazing. My own tastes fall more to knitting as a primary hobby.  While I have tried weaving on a rigid heddle loom, I can honestly say it didn't 'stick.'  I still have my rigid heddle looms (3 of them) and I may return to that craft at some point, but my focus has always been knitting.  And lately I have been doing more crocheting - a craft that seems to be growing in popularity.  More on my crocheting efforts in another post.My tapestry efforts for the weekend.But a new craft has capture my attention over the last few months: tapestry.  It is a kind of weaving, but on a different scale than traditional looms - and it produces a different product.  Traditional weaving creates wonderful pieces like shawls, towels, blankets, and rugs.  Tapestry is more like painting a picture - except with yarn.  The 'picture' above is the beginning of a sampler designed to teach you tapestry techniques.  It will never be a true picture - just a sampling of various stitches.The loom my sample is on is a table tapestry loom that I purchased about 5 years ago.  Something back then appealed to me about the craft.  I remember the seller had a beautiful - partly woven - picture of a tree and the sky - a landscape.  The whole tapestry process was reminiscent of my years doing needle point.  I enjoyed that as well.  But the loom sat idle for some time.  The last 5 years have been too busy to devote much time to learning a new craft. Following along in a book to build my knowledge of tapestry techniques.The picture below is the piece my cousin is working on.  It is a different sampler design, but it gives you a feeling of the lines, curves, and colors that can be achieved by this craft.My cousin's sampler.While tapestry can take a great deal of time to create, I find it relaxing and creative.  I will have to find a way to squeeze it into my available time - tapestry, knitting and crocheting.  That should pretty much fill up any left over free minutes in an already busy life."},
{"title": "Maryland Monsoon", "date": "Wednesday, July 25, 2018", "text": "View  from my deck.Yep!  That is what is happening in my 'neck of the woods' and surrounding areas.Everyday 4 or more inches of rain, like for weeks, but it has probably only been one week!  Flood warnings and flash flood warnings sprinkled throughout the state.  Very swollen creeks and tributaries spilling over and flooding areas.  Passible roads covered with inches of water because the drains can't handle the run off.  I heard this morning that a tornado touched down in a town in a near by county yesterday.  Tornados aren't common in our area but a tornado in July is rare, rare, rare.  Big trees 2 feet across or more falling over because their roots have been loosened and saturated severely.  In fact it was reported yesterday that a woman lost her life when a large tree fell on her house.  Drivers chronically drive into standing and fast moving water on the road - get stuck - and need rescue - despite the fact that it is report daily on TV and radio to avoid doing exactly that!  On the radio yesterday, I heard an example of total stupidity.  A driver got out of his, moved the road block cones put there by authorities to alert drivers to flooded roads ahead.  Then he got back in his car and drove into the water.  I say if you are THAT stupid, the sign on the road block should also include that no one will be rescued that ignores this road block!!Weather has been crazy for some time, but this month, July, it has been particularly unusual.  But here is the kick!Standing water in my parking lot.I LOVE rainy days.  I really do.  Even monsoon days.  I remember walking in the rain barefoot when I was in college - soaking wet and just enjoying the whole experience.  That was years and years ago when my feet didn't need orthotic support to work properly.  They would complain greatly if I attempted that now.  And, of course, there are the worms.  I don't walk on worms now and they seem to love this weather as much as I do - squiggling out of their holes to meander around the side walks. But ... oh the freedom of just walking in the rain.My plants love this.Although I can't walk barefoot anymore, I still don't mind getting wet.  My hair, clothes and shoes can be completely soaked and it wouldn't bother me.  I am lucky to have a partially protected deck and can generally sit on and enjoy weather events.  And I respect the power of water - and wouldn't drive into standing or moving water - whether there was a sign or not.Last night I tried to sit on the deck and write this post while the rain was pouring down in sheets.  Just listening to the sounds of the rain as it was hitting the ground (in torrents, really) but the direction of the wind was perfect for rain on my computer, and it isn't as fond of rain as I am.  So I opted to only take pictures and write the post inside.It is predicted that we will dry out by Friday. The only thing that would make the whole experience perfect ... would be if I could share some of it with other areas of the country that are experiencing droughts and horrific fires."},
{"title": "The Vacuum and The Nasal Spray", "date": "Tuesday, July 24, 2018", "text": "You can always count on me to address most pertinent issues of the day!  Last month it was refrigerators.  This month it is vacuums.😁I am not a vacuum snob.Really, I am not.Well, maybe I was a vacuum snob at one time.But I am not now.Ok, maybe I was a vacuum snob a few many times in my lifeover several years ... like maybe 30 years.But no more.Nope!I have evolved!! Kirby Vacuum - 1980sPhoto credit:  EbayIt started with the Kirby Vacuum.  The Kirby was a monster machine.  Big, heavy and strong.  Heavy because the shell and interior parts were made of steel, strong because it could to suck the life out of your carpet and big against other vacuums on the market at the time.  A vacuum on serious steroids.  It also increased your muscle tone, because it was a bloody effort to use ...  suction so great (no adjustments) that it gripped the rug in a kind of tug-of-war.  AND it was very expensive - something like $700 or more back in the 80's (expensive by today's standards, very expensive by 1980s standards.)  It was sold by a door-to-door sales man.  That is how I got mine - except he didn't knock on my door - he sold my friend one, and she shared her enthusiasm with me, and I chased him down so I could write that guy a check too!  *sigh*  Yes, I did that.  Hunted down a door-to-door salesman to pay him money!!  And then I told my sister about it, and he made yet another sale!  The things we remember from our past! I wish I could remember other things like curing cancer or making world peace.BUT, with the purchase of the Kirby, a vacuum SNOB born.  After all, I had a muscle machine now and I would never need to buy another vacuum again - never (per the salesman).  My house would be cleaner than my neighbors, as well.   Woo Hoo!!  (Today I would have asked if the Kirby also cleaned toilets and washed windows.  I would inquire ... if I never turned on the steroid vacuum would my house still be cleaner - because actually using a vacuum ... turning it on ...  has always been my real problem.)That Kirby lasted a long time, maybe 10 years - even had it repaired once, but in the end it began to fail and nothing could save it - so I was once again in the market for a vacuum cleaner.  By then I wanted a less expensive unit.  I think a bagless Hoover followed the Kirby.  Bagless vacuums were all the rage then (maybe the 90s??).  I had to have one.  Good for the environment, cheaper because there were no bags to buy, etc. etc. etc.  New technology, you know!  Except that since this was new technology - it was not really very good.  A few sweeps of the rug and the unit lost suction.  I lost interest fast.Then the next Hoover used bags - and I bought bags for several years.  Hoover was an ok brand, but I really felt like I needed a muscle machine again to clean 3 levels of a carpeted townhouse that had 2 adults, 2 kids, 4 cats and rotational move-in and out family members.Enter the Dyson!  By the end of the 90s Dyson had mastered the bagless technology and was beginning to take on more market share.  I had to have one.  I was dedicated to that brand for about 15 years.  Dyson makes a fabulous piece of equipment.  I have previously owned 2 upright Dysons, a canister Dyson and a stick Dyson.  They are very pricy, but they perform as advertised - they never lose suction.  But 'never' doesn't actually mean never as I discovered with the Kirby.That brings me to the present.For a few months I suspected that my current Dyson, a canister unit, was not picking up as well.  I blamed the condo carpet as difficult to clean.  After all, I had just spent over $2,000 for yet another new refrigerator so I wasn't eager to buy anything else.  But last week I got pretty frustrated - so I searched on Amazon - reviewed the comments and prices - and purchased an upright Shark.  It was less expensive than Dyson.  The living space I have to clean is less, so a 'muscle' machine just isn't needed.The head on this Shark isn't very wide.  The plus is it fits in almost all my tight spaces!!The Shark was delivered.  I put it together, and it was a snap.  Literally a 'snap'.  No screwdrivers needed.  It all snapped together.  That was a first for me.And then I turned it on.  (We are getting to the nasal spray part of the story, I promise.)I started in my guest room.  The Shark worked like a dream.  Easy to push and pull, rotates easily, adjustable, quieter than the Dyson.  I was halfway through cleaning the first room and I glanced at the collection container!  It was FULL.  To the top!!  Are you kidding me, I thought.  I just vacuumed few days ago.  I emptied it, and moved on.  By the time I finished the 1,375 square foot condo, I counted 8 full containers of mostly cat hair.  Gray cat hair.   Gray cat hair on a gray rug that apparently the Dyson did not pick up.  Yikes.I guess I should be grateful that my cat's hair matches the color of my rug - it never looked THAT dirty.  Sooo .... the Dyson wasn't working well for some time.I am not a clean freak.  The Dyson was doing a good job at 'fake' cleaning (to use current cultural terminology.). And animal hair has been part of my life for so long - I consider it as normal as dust.  BUT apparently it was affecting more than just looks.  At my husband's last doctor's visit he mentioned that he has been sneezing a lot over the last 6 months.  The doctor suggested using a nasal spray for allergies! Nasal Spray??  Heck!!What we needed was a new vacuum!!"},

Curiously, my doctor has held that opinion for some time.  😁 Go figure!  I guess you could say that I treat medical advice like a buffet - pick out what I like and ignore the rest.As age has crept up on me, I have a better appreciation for the gift of good genetics I inherited.  Elevated blood pressure and cholesterol are my only real issues (along with most elderly Americans,) and I could make a case for me personally that those two are caused by my life style choices.  (Ok, ok, my doctor said pretty much the same thing.). But a new 'player' has poked its ugly little head on my radar in the last few years ...  'pre-diabetic.'  Yikes.  While not diabetic now, I know that this is one condition I really don't want to manage.Have I been good to myself?  Yes.  I have been building up my endurance and flexibility with exercises classes, gym time and at home routines since early spring. Have I been bad?  You betcha!  My diet is the \"Retired Knitter's Whatever I Feel Like Eating\" diet (with the justification that life is short - and no one gets out alive.  If you need more information on the RK diet - just re-read the title!! 😋)   But sneaking in a McDonalds Big Mac or a candy bar has done me no favors.  Truthfully, I am amazed that my body has handled the RK Diet as well as it has.Sadly exercise alone isn't the answer.  Darn.  So what else is there!!Photo credit:  Weight Watchers.comAs always ... waiting in the wings for me has been Weight Watchers.I have used Weight Watchers several times in the past to bring down my weight or to just feel better.  And every time I go they have changed their program (improved it based on current science actually.) This time was no different.I am not good at the online memberships - I need to be kept accountable by going into the center, stepping on the scale in front of another person and receiving the written update from their computer.  I don't attend meetings.  I don't need hand-holding, cheering, or instruction.  What I need is another human being staring into my face as they inform me of my success or lack of it.  (They all have nice faces and they are low-key about it - BUT someone else knows my status and type A personalities like me need that.  We believe in winning, even if we have to lie about it!  Truth!!)So a week ago, I rejoined. Of course I had to buy a cook book. But their online library of recipes is robust.Also, another very good online resource of excellent low cal recipesis SkinnyTaste.com.  She includes WW Freestyle points for all recipes.The program is pretty simple.  Well ... not as simple as the RK diet, you understand, but simple as far as traditional (and medically approved) diets go.  Ha!You can have anything (I love diets like that - no no-nos - so when you slip and have that candy bar you haven't broken your will to live diet!  Ha)All fruits and almost all vegetables are allowed without limitations.  Yes!  That includes beans and bananas and some traditionally high calorie fruit choices. You can have lean proteins like fish, chicken, turkey, eggs, beans, and no fat yogurt without limitations.  Yes!  Everything else has a points value and you can scan the points with your phone on to an online tracking data base.  So easy.Basically - it is a low carb, low fat diet.The first week was an eye-opener for me in how my body responded to this new regime, (or as Weight Watchers describes it) a new life style choice.As long as I wasn't hungry - I didn't crave my chocolate or my Pringles or my Big Mac. I still think about sugar cookies.  Apparently they mean more to me than that other stuff.  Who knew!I wasn't hungry because the diet rests pretty soundly on lean proteins.When I did I want some 'unspecific something'  having a fruit seemed to do the trick.  Win-win so far.Photo credit: The Tropes Wiki - FandomNow here is the BIGGEST eye-opener of all  - to the point that my eyes could fall out of my head ... the regular thirst that I have lived with for about 5 years (thirst that prompted me to carry a water bottle literally everywhere) - THAT thirst - gone!  In the first day of the diet - GONE!!VERY STARTLING.  And I suspect know the reason.Remember that pre-diabetic state I mentioned earlier?  Well I did a little research.  With diabetes or pre-diabetes that is not controlled - thirst is one of the warning signals that something is not chemically right with your blood values - specially your glucose or sugars.Ok - I get it. A little message from my body sent by way of my mouth -  eat more sensibly.  Since I ignored that little thirst message for years - I guess I was lucky that diabetes didn't jump all over my ignorant self and add condition #3 to my treatment plan.  If I am lucky - the new diet choices may also impact blood pressure and cholesterol.As far as weight -  down 2.8 pounds.  Pretty painless weight drop as well.  My knees will probably thank me a few more pounds from now. Win-win.Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks!!!Fine print for anything I wrote here:  Nothing I have conveyed in this post should be accepted as medical advice. NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING!!  Remember I am the creator of the RK diet - and I assure you that the RK diet has killed a bunch of people.  I am just lucky I am not dead.  I have no medical training.  Do not take anything in this post as medical advice for you.  Consult with your doctor - and if you choose medical advice like a buffet (like I did), you might want to reconsider that decision.  Cheers.  Now I am covered legally.  😇"},
{"title": "The Accidental President", "date": "Friday, July 20, 2018", "text": "Harry Truman was my dad's favorite President. Why is that note worthy to me?  My dad didn't express much interest in anything, but his job.   He mentioned very little about his past.  But he was a World War II vet as were most men of his generation.  He was with Patton's 3th Army in Europe, and he thought President Harry Truman was a great man.  He mentioned that more than once.  Seriously ... he had little to say about anything in his life so this repeated comment was something that remained with me. Photo credit: AmazonWhen I saw this audiobook, The Accidental President by A.I Baime, I couldn't resist downloading it.Here is the Publisher's Summary:Heroes are often defined as ordinary characters who get thrust into extraordinary circumstances, and through courage and a dash of luck, cement their place in history. Chosen as FDR’s fourth term Vice President for his well-praised work ethic, good judgment, and lack of enemies, Harry S. Truman--a Midwesterner who had no college degree and had never had the money to buy his own home--was the prototypical ordinary man. That is, until he was shockingly thrust in over his head after FDR’s sudden death. During the climactic months of the Second World War, Truman had to play judge and jury, pulling America to the forefront of the global stage. The first four months of Truman’s administration saw the founding of the United Nations, the fall of Berlin, victory at Okinawa, fire bombings of Tokyo, the first atomic explosion, the Nazi surrender, the liberation of concentration camps, the mass starvation of Europe, the Potsdam Conference, the controversial decision to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the surrender of Imperial Japan, and finally, the end of World War II and the rise of the Cold War. No other president had ever faced so much in such a short period of time.Truman followed in the footsteps of FDR who was and is a much loved and revered President.  Most citizens today know who lead our nation during WWII -  many Presidents had no major event during their tenure to mark their time in office and test their leadership skills.  At FDR's sudden death, Truman was thrust into a fire storm of world events that would try the abilities of any individual.I think that anyone who knows history would agree that Harry Truman truly did face more challenging times than most Presidents.  As I listened to this book I began to see the scope of the events that Truman wrestled with using only his common sense and practical approach.   President Truman has his haters and his supporters.  Haters to this day point to all the Japanese people killed by the Atomic bombs and the introduction of a new and fierce technology that would change our world  forever.  My dad was a supporter ... because in his words, Harry Truman saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of American soldiers from a certain death in an assault on the Japanese mainland.  Japanese people of that time, even civilians, would fight to the death in defense of country and the Emperor.  My dad was one of those soldiers scheduled to be re-assigned from the European theatre of war to the Pacific theatre.  My dad felt that Truman's decision to drop those Atomic bombs and end our war with Japan saved his life.  President Truman, the common man, was his hero.Listening to this account of all the juggled considerations that went into President Truman's decisions - well, I am now a fan as well.  I would also argue that the development and use of the Atomic bomb was the goal of many countries at that time.  We just got there first.  President Truman inherited that Atomic bomb - and it was going to be used by somebody if not the US.  He took steps in its use that will always be controversial.  But he made the tough decision.  He truly was the common man - a regular citizen - thrust into history against his wishes - and who made a huge difference in the world.I have read a lot about FDR and his wife Eleanor and now I have taken the time to get to know Truman.  I believe that history has shown over and over again, that the right person comes along ... at the right time ... to do the job that needs to be done.  As different as Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman were, FDR was the 'right man' to lead us during WWII and Harry Truman was that 'right man' to finish the job as we exited the war.  Now we find ourselves facing different threats - external and internal and many self inflicted - but all just as serious and game changing as an Atomic bomb.  Sadly that technology has not stood still and our human ability to create destruction has grown to frightening levels.  I kind of hope there is someone 'waiting in the wings' - ready to step in and be the right person for our country and the world now - someone who will do the right thing at the right time - do the job that needs to be done.  Our current President is not that man.I am hoping history doesn't fail us now.I recommend this book."},

{"title": "Approaching Another Anniversary", "date": "Sunday, July 15, 2018", "text": "Next month we will have lived in this condo for 2 years.  Hard to believe that much time has passed.As long time readers know, the transition from our townhouse of 30 years to a 55+ condominium community was very hard for me.  If my husband was not disabled, we would probably still reside in the townhouse.  It is where the most important experiences of life happened and almost half my life was spent.  We made improvements that were long overdue.  It was pretty much the way we wanted it to be - except for the steps.  We couldn't improve away the 20 steps from the parking lot to our front door ... not counting the flights of steps between floors.  I couldn't ignore the falls my visually impaired husband had on those steps.  His falls were like little warning bells in my brain - better find a safer place before something more serious occurs.  Circumstances dictated that our time there had come to an end.The condo finally feels like it belongs to me - and not me living in someone else's space.  The pluses of this condo remain. It is safer, easier to maintain, cheaper and exactly the right amount of living space for 2 retired folks in their 70's.  When I think of what it would be like to return to our townhouse today ... I can't wrap my brain around how it would work.  We are in the right place now.Looking back I can see that we timed our move just inside a critical window of energy and ability.  Each decade of life seems to have its own defining characteristics.  They are usually not discovered until you are living through them.  I believe my 60s could be described like the month of March except in reverse.  \"In like a lion, out like a lamb.\"   Without detailing all the many tasks involved in buying and selling property or the scope of sorting, downsizing and moving all your worldly possessions ... simply stated, moving takes an enormous amount of energy when you are 69 facing 70.   With each passing year, that effort gets only harder.  It's like ramping up the effort of living into high gear when nature is downshifting your body so you can \"go the distance.\"  Opposing forces for sure. From 2 years out - I am grateful we did what we did ... when we did it!  Because I was in the driver's seat for all that move, I was drenched with uncertainty, anxiety and fatigue through all of it.   I am so thankful that I can look back at that experience and know that there are no regrets.  Yes, approaching the second anniversary of our move to this condo is filled with peace and confirmation. You can't ask for more than that!"},
{"title": "Liberation, sort of", "date": "Wednesday, July 11, 2018", "text": "OK, I know this post is just a justification for my enormous stash of yarn amassed over the 21 years as a knitter!  Truely, over those 21 years, I have chastised myself, inventoried, organized, chastised myself again, knitted with some, gave away some, bought some more, and collected some just because I couldn't walk away and not have a little of that beauty be mine ...  AND again chastised myself for this extravagance.I am done with all that now! I own yarn.I own a lot of yarn.I will buy yarn again.I own yarn that will outlive me because I can't possibly get it all knitted up before I die.And to paraphrase our First Lady ...I don't really care.I have been liberated from all that self reflection and self criticism by a simple little book called A Stash of One's Own: Knitters on Loving, Living with, and Letting Go of Yarn, An anthology edited by Clara Parkes.The synopsis:Anyone with a passion has a stash, whether it is a collection of books or enough yarn to exceed several life expectancies.  With her trademark wry, witty approach, Parkes brings together fascinating stories from all facets of stash-keeping and knitting life.  Whether the yarn stash is muse, memento, creative companion, career guide, or lifeline in tough times, the deeply engaging stories take a surprising and fascinating look at why we collect, what we cherish, and how we let go.Yes, this is the book for me.  I think I can safely say that we are all collectors of some sort.   Some collect books, figurines, china, silverware, tools, jewelry, stamps, experiences, wine, steps (walkers with pedometers), kitchen equipment, music, games, baseball cards, travel mementoes, home canned veggies (admit it, you love seeing all those jars of canned tomatoes lined up), even beer cans!  Yes, beer cans.  During the 1970s we had a friend who had a wall display with all kinds of beer cans.  I don't think they even liked beer! I think it is human nature to collect.I have the actual book (not digital) in my small personal library of books.  I am the kind of person who writes in her books, uses stickers to find stuff again, dog ears pages and so on.  Some book collectors think that is a sacrilege to mar the book in anyway.  I hold a different opinion.  It shows this book was read, used, loved and important data highlighted for future reference.  It shows the book has function and value.  Isn't that what books are supposed to be?  A tool for knowledge.Here are some quotes from this book that struck me (and my comments, of course.)Essay: Stashers: Who the heck are we? by LelaNargi\"What's the largest number of skeins anyone has tucked into their Ravelry stash?  You will be either glad or very sorry you asked -- regardless, the owner is doubtless someone you'd like to cozy up to.  She or he is the proud stasher of 11,839 skeins of yarn; the next stasher in line has a still impressive 11,522 skeins in his or her collection.\"  I feel better all ready!  😁 I am no where near that level of collecting.Isn't that beautiful yarn! Well, let me tell you, it is a bear to knit with. I have tried.  Now it is display/inspiration yarn!Maybe someday I will find out exactly what it wants to be.Essay:  Triptych by Stephanie Pearl-McPhee\"Most of my yarn is for knitting, but some of it has a more complicated destiny as support staff: It is there to make me want to knit.  You bet I've had it for ten years, and I completely admit that it's a yarn pet.  I have no intention of every knitting it, but it's earning the real estate it takes up with how it makes me feel about knitting.  It is the textile artist's equivalent of a painting hung on the wall.  It's there to be beautiful and to help me dream of possibility.\"This is so true.  The artistry of some fiber dyers and the technique of blending fibers to create a yarn can be truly genius by some mom-and-pop fiber vendors.  It is like going to a farmer's market and seeing the perfect tomatoes - all plump and red and without blemish - and you can almost taste them - and they wind up in your basket costing you more than the ones in the grocery store - but ... oh, so much better.  Same with yarn.  The yarn I sometimes buy costs more than what you get at Michael's or Joanne's, but it is oh so much better.  One of three book cases!Essay:  Fear Not by Sue Shankle\"I am a mental health clinician.  Let's get this out in the open right away:  I do not think having a big ol' curated stash is a problem.  Does anybody believe that Michelangelo just decided to carve the David one day and went out and bought a big slab of marble?  Heck no.  He had that thing sitting around for a long time before he even started.  Because he had to look at it, play with it, and possibly sniff it before he started work.  He planned that stuff.  That's what we artists do.\"I so love and agree this comment.  In fact, I am contemplating a rather large crochet project right now (probably 6,000 yards of yarn) using materials from my stash - that I previously purchased for sweaters.  Loved that yarn on sight, never found the right sweaters, never had the time, but now this new project calls to me and this yarn has the potential of being perfect for the task.  (More on that project another time.)See?  Art!I haven't tried sniffing it yet. 😏I haven't finished reading this book - only halfway through.  It is an easy book to pick up and put down because it is devided into essays of a few pages each.  But so far it has been worth the time, marked all up with quotes I thought meaningful to me and will remain in my library as a reminder.What reminder?  I am normal!!"},

Ahhh ... old books.  I miss those adventures.When the Kindle and the Audiobook craze was born, I couldn't imagine giving up the 'hold-in-your-hand' book.  Years went by and I watched peers shifting over to digital technology for their reading pleasure.  I shook my head in disbelief and knew in my heart I would never get caught up in that trend.Ha! Famous last words.Today I have a Kindle Paper White full of books (many free, some borrowed) and a iPhone with many Audible titles - AND a tiny library of actual books (most reference books) enough to fill maybe  2 boxes.  I could do a whole post on why I enjoy my digital technology even though we were sort of forced into it.  My husband downsized his large library about 6 years ago when reading became too difficult, and I did the same with my books moving into our condo (a move required for my husband's safety.)  It is amazing how his blindness has changed our lives.  I do miss going to book stores - especially used book stores.  Sometimes I stop at Barnes and Noble to look around, but it isn't as much fun without my husband.  I usually leave empty handed.About two weeks ago, our senior center had a used book sale.  I stood in the doorway peering in wondering should I bother.  Then I was cheerfully invited in to look around by one of the volunteers.  It would have been rude not to enter.  All the paper backs were 3 for a $1.  Wow, a bargain.  So I started to poke around.  No little old man books on the tables but lots recent popular stuff.  I found these three books that just seemed to want a new home.I haven't read them yet, but I thought I would share the titles and brief descriptions to see if anything catches your fancy like it did mine.Recipes from the Dump by Abigail Stone - really, how could anyone resist a book with that title.  Here is the book cover synopsis.Dignity Divinity (recipe)1 father, deserted1/4 cup sugar2 cups flour2 heaping tablespoons children1 father, disappeared1 indulgent or disinterested town1 woman with a weight problem, shabbily dressed1 or more public embarrassmentsPut all the ingredients in a bowl, mix well, and savor this hilarious, heartfelt chronicle of life with Gabby Fulbriten.  A single mom raising three kids next to the Leadbelly, Vermont town dump.  Gabby is tirelessly searching - for a man who knows there's more to a relationship than candlelight and clean laundry, for the thin person the Diet Center promises lives inside her, and for the missing ingredient that will bring order to her cluttered existence.  A mock cookbook of our culture, Recipes from the Dump will warm your stomach, fill your soul, and, like an afternoon spent trading laughs and recipes with an old friend, leave you hungering for more. The Lobster Chronicles by Linda Greenlaw - a true story of drama in small-town life and a celebration of family and community.  I am a sucker for true stories of people who live very different lives from my own and this one takes place off the coast of Maine - a win-win for me.  The synopsis.After seventeen years at sea, Linda Greenlaw decided it was time to take a break from being a swordboat captain.  She felt she needed to return home, to a tiny island seven miles off the Maine coast with a population of seventy year-round residents, thirty of whom are her relatives.   She would pursue a simpler life; move back in with her parents; become a professional lobsterman; and find a man and settle down.  But almost none of this works out as planned, and soon she is forced to reevaluate everything she thought she knew about life, luck and lobsters.Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier - a book made movie and described as an 'American Odyssey.  The synopsis.Sorely wounded and fatally disillusioned in the fighting at Petersburg, Inman, a Confederate soldier, decides to walk back to his home in the Blue Ridge Mountains and to Ada, the woman he loved there years before.  His trek across the disintegrating South brings him into intimate and sometimes lethal converse with slaves and marauders, bounty hunters and witches, both helpful and malign.  At the same time, Ada is trying to revive her father's derelict farm and learn to survive in a world where old certainties have been swept away. There is little doubt that these books will not go the distance to make it to 'little old man status.'  And paperbacks seldom last anyway.  But they appear to be interesting and fun stories.  When I am done, I will just pass them on to others.Happy summer reading, all."},

{"title": "4th of July Memories - and a shadow legacy.", "date": "Thursday, July 5, 2018", "text": "I did a whole series of posts on my mom. I seldom speak of my dad.  But the 4th of July always triggers memories of him. 1943 New York City, NY My dad and mom on a date before they married.His birthday was July 3, 1917 - so if he had lived, he would 101 today.  Not sure why every 4th of July triggers memories of him.  Father's Day doesn't do that.  Our family didn't do anything special on the 4th of July.  In fact, our family seldom did anything special.  Guess it is just that his birthday fell so very close to the holiday.1954 Hyattsville, MarylandMy family - probably the only picture I have of us as a family.I was 7 years old.Memories of my dad for the most part aren't happy ones.  He suffered from alcoholism - for as long as I knew him.  Sober he was a wonderful person.  Drunk he was just the opposite.  In the 1950s  the disease of alcoholism was not well understood.  It was seen as a personal failing ... or even as a choice you could simply choose to do differently.  It wasn't talked about - it was something to keep hidden.  We hid it well. I am not silent about it now as an adult.  There are limits I have set in my personal life with regards to alcohol and one of them is speaking out.I think I have a better grip on what addiction is, but I also have some rigid expectations due to my formative years living with an alcoholic.  Alcoholism is black or white for me .  You have it, you get help.  You don't get help, I limit my exposure to you.  If you don't treat the drug alcohol with respect for the risks it poses ... then I can't be around you.  There are no shades of gray for me being the child of an alcoholic.  I spent 21 years of my life forced into situation not of my own making - and I won't waste one more day of my life coping with it if you won't help yourself.  I know that is a hard stand to take - sounds heartless even as I re-read my post, but for even the closest of family ...  it is a line in the sand that can't be crossed for me. It is the shadow legacy my father left for me.These are some of the thoughts that fill me up around the 4th of July.  But it is not all bad.  I saw glimpses of the man my mom fell in love with.  I saw the love he had for his family - when he was sober.  I saw the father who loved his children in many small ways.  So I try to balance the bad with the good when remembering.Dad left behind next to nothing of himself in life, sadly.  But I do have one very precious document he hand wrote to me when I was about 12 years old.  Dad was not a writer.  He did not have a way with words.  He had only a 9th grade education.  He worked with his hands, and they were rough and thickened from years of hard work.  Managing a pen probably wasn't entirely comfortable.  But on one early summer morning before he left for work, he wrote this letter to me.  It brings tears to my eyes to read it even this day 60 years later.  I was preparing to go on a Girl Scout camping trip and would be gone for a few days.  (I bet that trip was in July.) He wasn't going to get a chance to say goodbye before I left.  So he wrote this letter.  (note: Lucky was our dog at the time, and Canada Dry was where he worked.)So, although my memories are filled with many darknesses, there are some shining lights he left behind for me.  What a wonderful father he could have been if addiction had not entered his life.Not all shadows are sad.(The top image header of my blog  has a picture of dad and I at the beach. I don't remember this picture, but it does make me smile - happier times were rare.  We seemed to be enjoying ourselves.)"},
{"title": "The Air", "date": "Wednesday, July 4, 2018", "text": "IT IS HOT!!!I've lived in Maryland since I was 6 years old.  It can get very hot and very humid.   Now we are not talking jungle levels of heat and humidity.  But it is distasteful enough that folks from other states sometimes comment \"what's the deal with your weather?\"  I think the issue is this - if you aren't living by the ocean, or on a mountain, or on a farm, or in a forest, anywhere that makes the heat manageable - you are just meat cooking in the sun.  That's what it feels like here this week.I was raised without air conditioning and lived without it until I was married - so I know it is possible to live without it.  And with time I know I would adjust to no air conditioning again.   But in my area - high heat and high humidity creates another problem that I can't just \"get used to.\"  Poor air quality!I didn't always understand about air quality.   About 10 years ago on a hot humid day,  I went out for a walk.  I had been walking regularly.  I was in pretty good shape.  The report said the air quality level was Red.   I couldn't see anything wrong with the air ... and besides ... air quality alerts were for the elderly and for people with chronic problems.  So I headed out.I got about 1/2 mile down the road, and I couldn't seem to take a deep breath.  My lungs filled but the exchange of gases just wasn't doing it.  My energy lagged and I began to feel sick.  I slowly walked home wondering if I was coming down with something.  I got back into our air conditioned townhouse and sat down.  Almost immediately I began to feel better - like I had an oxygen mask on!And it happened again today - that \"can't catch my breath\" feeling - only I was just out running some errands.  While I was in the air conditioned car I was fine.  I was fine in stores.  But trips through the parking lots - not good.  I don't know what the air quality was today, but my lungs said it wasn't good enough.What is crazy about this is - I am not an ex-smoker.  I don't live with a smoker.  I don't have a history of chronic lung disease like asthma or repeated bronchitis.  I am older so maybe age is contributing to my struggle to breathe in these conditions.I am not knowledgeable about the topic of air quality and weather.  But I know the way we live has caused most of these problems with our environment.  That topic has been well researched and proven.  Makes me sad that the air which we breath is tainted at times by our own actions.But on this day, and at my age, I am grateful beyond measure to the invention of air-conditioning.  I might be able to adjust to warmer temps, but I need to be able to breathe.So how is everyone else doing?Extreme heat in your little corner of the world?  And has your air quality been acceptable?  Do you live in an area where air conditioning is needed?"},
{"title": "Immigration - Worth the Read", "date": "Tuesday, July 3, 2018", "text": "Found this on Facebook.  Its rather long, but it puts more facts to our current immigration issues with the US American border. Facts are always good!Mike HarlosJune 26 at 7:10 AMSo I have almost completely avoided political posts for over a year now.Today, I take a break from that. Tornillo, TX is on the US/Mexico border. There is a “tent city facility” setup there. The facility is housing 326 children (312 boys, 14 girls). Of the 326:162 are from Guatemala117 are from Honduras40 are from El Salvador4 are from “other countries”3 are from MexicoSOURCE for these numbers:https://www.msnbc.com/…/joy-reid-and-cal-perry-get-a-first-…(And apologies, I would love to post a Fox News link but they don’t seem to be trying to get into these facilities to release these kinds of statistics, but if it happens someone please let me know!)I think it’s a fair assumption that the percentage of children would also be fairly close to the percentage of adults that came to the border. So if less than 1% are from Mexico, what exactly is happening?The reason that 98% are from El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala is that, out of 195 countries:El Salvador has the 2nd highest rate of violent deaths.Honduras has the 4th highest rate of violent deaths.Guatemala has the 17th highest rate of violent deaths.SOURCE for rate of violent deaths:http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/…/U-R…/SAS-Report-GVD2017.pdfI’ve included a map for those unaware of the locations of each of these countries.We are being told that all these people “pouring into the US” are Mexican drug dealers, rapists, murderers, “bad hombres”. But it just isn’t true. Think about when a major hurricane comes to Florida and people pack up their vehicles and evacuate, out of caution, especially those with children... just in case. Depending on the situation, people typically traveling 50-500 Miles (driving to inland Florida or Atlanta/Tennessee) Now imagine it’s a hurricane that is firing bullets randomly and people are dying all around you in your neighborhood every day. And you have children. To quote President Ronald Reagan, from his final Oval Office address to the nation: “The past few days when I've been at that window upstairs, I've thought a bit of the \"shining city upon a hill.\" The phrase comes from John Winthrop, who wrote it to describe the America he imagined. What he imagined was important because he was an early Pilgrim, an early freedom man. He journeyed here on what today we'd call a little wooden boat; and like the other Pilgrims, he was looking for a home that would be free.I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it, and see it still.”SOURCE for Reagan quote:http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29650The VAST MAJORITY of the people coming to the United States are coming, in the ways discussed so much lately, are seeking refugee status or asylum. US Legal Definitions of both “refugee” and “asylum”:https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylumStop getting caught up in just agreeing with everything someone says or does because you voted for that person and if they do something wrong, it’s human nature to defend the choice you made in that voting booth. Don’t put pride and ego ahead of intellect. Every situation should be judged based on fact, not on who is saying it or doing it and not just because it’s “your team”. Parents aren’t taking their children and leaving everything else and everyone else they’ve ever known to walk, raft, swim, hide in vehicles, etc for ~2,000 miles to get to our border and request refugee or asylum status just to “get free hand outs” and “take our jobs”. (1 little sidenote, if “Mexico” (And we’ve already established it mostly isn’t Mexico) is really sending their worst (no one is sending these people, and I can’t imagine that most people that really care about their children this much are “the worst”) that are “murderers, drug dealers, rapists” and you’re worried about one of these people taking your job, what the hell is it you do for a living?)Yes, any time you have a large number of people, there will be some bad apples. But there’s a reason you’ve never been shown actual statistics that show that someone coming here as a refugee or seeking asylum is any more likely to commit a crime than anyone else. Because it isn’t true.MOST are doing it for the same reasons people evacuate. They’re doing it to protect their loved ones.And they’re doing it in a way that is consistent with the United States Refugee & Asylum laws. I can explain it to youI cannot understand it for you."},
{"title": "Almost A Living Thing", "date": "Sunday, July 1, 2018", "text": "This month I celebrate my 8th year of blogging.I got thinking.Why did I start blogging?  How did I pick this title and why 20 years?  (and then I got fixated on the number 20)  Did I think I would live only 20 more years, or blog for only 20 years?    Did I think my next 20 years would be (hopefully) exciting and full of things to blog about?('cause my life to that point wasn't any of those things.)I can answer the first question.Why did I start blogging? I started blogging during a period of personal turmoil.  When I started the blog I was years into caregiving for my mom. I felt alone in that role, and the stresses were piling up steadily.  How to cope without burdening others.I tried to keep a journal - on paper.  Instinctively I knew writing would help.  But using pen and paper just didn't provide the right flow or feed back.  My brain engages very well with a key board - not so much with pen and paper.Then I met Karen at my knitting group.  At some point she mentioned her blog - Life Is Good - Smile.  I was intrigued.  I had never met a blogger.  Her blogging name is HappyOne.  I visited her site.  I found it filled with her normal everyday activities and her walking experiences (she is a daily walker of 6 miles - no joke!)  She takes beautiful pictures - just on a point-and-shoot camera - but she has a good eye for photography.  Almost every single day she blogs.  Reading it that first time had an almost immediate settling effect on my agitated mind.  I still follow her blog, and I still find it settling.  What her blog said to me is that life is amazing if you make it so - no matter what your life is filled with.  I encourage you to visit when you can.  Life Is Good - SmileI thought ... maybe I should give blogging a try!Looking back over my first posts in 2010 I noticed that I bounced around in my topics and in my writing style.  Settling into the practice of writing took some time.  I also noticed that I never mentioned the 'elephant in the room' of my brain.  My mom!  I remember intentionally omitting that part of my life in my writing - even though it was most of my life at that time.  I was going to stay focused on all those other things that made up the person that was me.  It was me I was trying to help.  And there was a lot of me I set aside to be a caregiver!  I needed to hold on to all that stuff I set aside somehow.  My blog was where I was holding the me-stuff.MY STUFFWithin a very short time, however, my life with mom became an ongoing series of posts called \"Through My Caregiver Eyes.\" **  It is hard to stop a dam from breaking once it starts to crack. Yes, I was still knitting, and a wanna-be walker (you will want to walk after reading Karen's blog!) and a wife, mother, cousin, grand-dog sitter.  I was all those things and more, but it was the caregiver role that drove me to write.  The series on my mom had healing properties I couldn't have anticipated. Writing about her and our time together reminded me why I chose to be a caregiver, and how much I loved and owed the lady I was lucky enough to call 'mom.'  The blog kept me going through some very sad times toward the end of her life.OTHER PEOPLE'S STUFFOver time this practice of writing became more than just a way to vent pressure.  I have 'met' people in the world that I would never have had a chance to know any other way.  I know some of them better than my neighbor across the hall.  I have vicariously experienced different life styles, ways of thinking, travel, celebrations, sorrows, crafts, new family members, new careers, big moves, etc.  And in a stunning realization for me, I noticed that many of my experiences were replicated in the lives of others.  I met other caregivers.  I had met my 'Tribe.'  I wasn't alone. Finally, it confirmed that people aren't so different from each other as popular news organizations seem to portray.  It all comes to me through the window of my computer screen ... through blogging.  BLOG FRIENDSHIPSOh, there have been some gaps in my writing since mom died and at times I have considered closing down my blog.  Thought, however, never became action!  Why is that??  I believe regardless of the reason you start your blog - if you do it long enough, regulars visit you and you visit them and your circle of contacts grow and you get to know a large array of people .... the blog platform grows with regular attention - just like a living thing.I encourage people - friends and family - to blog.  It is the most direct and simplest way to stay connected in a world that sometimes is one BIG disconnect.Did I answer any of the questions I asked myself at the start of this post!  Maybe one.  I think the other questions are still a mystery.Happy Blog Anniversary to me!Eight years into a 20 year stretch!Let's see where we go from here.Thanks for joining me.** If you are a caregiver or just curious, you can find the series of posts Through My Caregiver Eyes by sorting on the Labels section, right side of the screen, under that title."},
{"title": "The Americans - TV show on Amazon Prime", "date": "Thursday, June 28, 2018", "text": "I am a big 'binge' TV series watcher.  The only things I watch in real time are local news, Dancing with the Stars, and American Idol.  Everything else I pick up on Netflix or Amazon Prime.My latest obsession is The Americans on Amazon Prime.Here is an online description of the show.Philip and Elizabeth Jennings are two KGB spies in an arranged marriage who are posing as Americans in suburban Washington, D.C., shortly after Ronald Reagan is elected president. The couple have two children, teenager Paige and preteen Henry, who are unaware of their parents' true identities. The complex marriage becomes more passionate and genuine each day but is continually tested as the Cold War escalates. As Philip begins to warm up to America's values and way of life, his relationship with Elizabeth becomes more complicated. Further complicating things is the arrival of the Jennings' new neighbour, FBI agent Stan Beeman, who is part of a new division of the agency tasked with fighting foreign agents on U.S. soil. The drama series was created by former CIA agent-turned-author Joe Weisberg.I am most definitely not into spy movies, TV shows or books.  I  skipped passed The Americans when I was brousing at least 20 times, before I became desperate enough to give it a chance.  Boy, I am glad I gave it a chance.  It is great!  I was sucked in on the very first episode.Photo Credit: AmazonThe characters are well fleshed out and you find yourself caring about them even though technically they are the enemy (Russian) on American soil posing as normal American citizens - and we (the actual Americans) are wearing the 'white hats.'  But the 'white hat hero' label depends on whose side you are on.  If you are Russian, the Russians are wearing the white hats.  It is worth noting that we probably have our own 'plants' in other countries as well.  Right or wrong, I suspect it is how the intelligence community works on both side of the ocean.The Russian spies are believable and likable - but, boy, are they skilled at what they do.   I love the fact that the wife doesn't need a man to defend her.  She is as dangerous as any man.  And they are patriotic to Mother Russia, just like are to our homeland.  Other things I liked:There are 5 seasons available for viewing - and the 6th season is set to be aired this year.  This kind of track record means the show has something going for it.  Crap usually doesn't go that many seasons.It takes place in DC - and surrounding areas - which has been my home since age 6 - so it is fun to know the areas they talk about.The show is described as a period piece ... the Ronald Reagan era.  I like period pieces. Fun, because I lived through that time and remember it well.  Not fun, because they called it a period piece and I lived through that time and remember it well. 😀Although Phillip and Elizabeth are the enemy (from our point of view), they have values and a code they live by that is strongly influenced by Russia.  Just like we do.  They aren't so different from us.  In a time of political polarization - it is good to remind ourselves that Russia thinks 'they' are the good guys.   It is also interesting to see them secretly settled in our culture and how they managed it.Things that I questionYou have to suspend disbelief somewhat with their family life.  The children are age 14 and preteen.  They are good kids.  Both I think are young enough to need oversight!  When you are a spy - it is not a 9 to 5 job!  Many scenes take place with both parents out of the house overnight.  There is no sitter at home for the kids.  The fact that these children are not monitored well is a bit unbelievable to me.  What if one kid got sick over night?  What if there was a fire?  There would be no one there for them.  Really ... I don't see that part of the story entirely believeable.Since many scenes take place at night - and they have day jobs, when do they sleep??There is a fair amount of violence.  I don't mind violence in my shows if it is appropriate to the story, and I think this violence is.  While I think that being a spy leaves you open to those possibilities, I doubt it is as prevalent as this show portrays but my spy knowledge is pretty rusty - being I don't know any spies and I don't read many spy books.(If you are squeamish, don't read this bullet.)  Some violence was actually informative.  A woman was killed in a hotel room.  Phillip and Elizabeth are tasked with removing the body ... but how.  You can't just wrap it up in a sheet and carry it through the hotel lobby.  Elizabeth brings in a suitcase - and she and Phillip break the limbs of the body down (on camera) into a size that can be contained in the suitcase.  Sounds gruesome but less than if the body was chopped up - and less mess too.I am working my way through Season 2.  I give this show a Thumbs Up!!"},

AND pay full price.  The stainless models were on sale for 4th of July.  So I just accepted the inevitable and bought the stainless.  We will be replacing our stove and microwave in the next 12 months - so they will also be stainless.  And I am told by everyone ... property buyers want stainless appliances. So what are we doing for dinner tonight??   Delivery pizza.  There is no food in the house now until we shop tomorrow,  HOWEVER, tonight we will be able to refrigerate any leftovers, finally!!In case I sound too sour grapes about the color, I am not.  The fridge has been here for about 3 hours - the stainless is starting to grow on me!  See ... you can teach an old dog new tricks!And now this saga is OVER!  And the elevator in my building is repaired and working!!  And I have gotten no spam since changing up my blog!!!  AND lastly, I am getting better.  While all these things were going on I got sick with a fairly substantial chest and head cold, that I think I got from my darling little grand daughter.  She had a cold on my last visit and I cuddled her for about 4 hours.  You know how this goes ... child gets a cough - last a few days - grandmother catches the same bug - but going on 8 days and will linger for at least that much longer.  No problem.  The cuddle session was worth it.  Soon as I am well, I'll be back for more.Things are looking up!!"},
{"title": "Immigration - Thoughts to Consider", "date": "Sunday, June 24, 2018", "text": "By now the firestorm of citizen feedback regarding our nation's actions at the Mexican border has changed some of the terrible practices we have witnessed.  How to repair the damage that has been done (i.e. returning over 2,000 children to their families) is yet to be determined.But I came across this piece.  I know the immigration problem has many sides and it is complicated with many strong emotions, but this piece seems to narrow down some simple facts ... setting aside the fact we are historically an immigrant nation - unless you are Native American or were just lucky enough to be born here.Thoughts worth thinking about.”Post by Wyeth RuthvenSo, I did immigration casework for Senator Fritz Hollings, studied immigration law at law school under a former INS general counsel, and worked for a border Congressman in the district that included the Rio Grande Valley. So hear me out:1. These people in detention have not committed a crime.2. I don't mean that in a moral or a figurative sense. I mean literally. It is NOT a crime to ask for asylum.3. These people didn't jump a fence, they didn't sneak into the back yard. They are knocking on the front door and saying \"People are trying to kill me in my home country, will you let me in?\"4. Now, I didn't fall off the turnip truck. Some of these people are lying. That's why you have a hearing. And because they might wander off, these people are held in detention until the hearing.5. This hearing is NOT in a criminal court. It's in an immigration court. Because these people have not committed a crime.6. Immigration court is not like criminal court. You don't have a right to an attorney.7. So these people are waiting around, separated from their children, with no attorney, until they get a hearing.8. In 2015, the median wait for an immigration hearing was 404 days.9. Here's where it gets even more twisted.10. If people plead guilty to asylum fraud, they get their kids back and get deported.11. So these people knock on the front door, which is perfectly legal, and we take their kids, and tell them the quickest way to get them back is to confess.12. If someone committed a crime - shoplifting, armed robbery, murder - and you took their kids away to make them confess, that confession would be thrown out.13. But these confessions are lawful, because this isn't criminal court.14. Because these people haven't committed a crime.15. Now some people think that if we make it so unpleasant for these people, they will stop trying to cross the border.16. But the message this sends isn't \"Go Home.\" The message it sends is \"Sneak in.\"17. If they go home, they think they will be murdered. If they request asylum, they are separated from their children.18. If they sneak in successfully, they're safe. If they sneak in and get caught, they are no worse off than if they sought asylum legally.19. And remember, these people haven't committed a crime.”"},

{"title": "A Rant:  Time to build that wall!", "date": "Wednesday, June 20, 2018", "text": "Fair Warning to readers.If you are a Trump supporter, please stop reading now.  This is a rant.  It is my personal opinion.  It won't be repeated in the future on this blog, but it needs to be said.I am putting up my own \"wall,\" on the crazy and depressing political scene, on this day, with this blog post.I have lived in a state of disbelief that Trump was elected President.   My gut said this man was wrong for this job.  But in the beginning - without a track record to measure against - it seemed unfair to judge him. Over the first year, I have watched all the repeated 'political fire storms' of this administration on the news and in social media daily.  Every single day!  It never ends.  This President intentionally creates most of his own problems and seems to thrive on it.  He has made terrible picks for many of his most important positions.  He says things that have to be 'translated' by his staff, because the general population finds his words at times shocking.  This past week I watched \"Trump: An American Dream\" on Netflix.  The series followed him in his business and personal life up to the point he entered politics for the Presidency.  It highlighted the fact that his ideas, his words, his behavior,  has not changed a smidge since he learned to walk and talk.  Granted - you can argue that any sources of information can be slanted.  But I have heard enough words said from his own mouth on camera  over and over and over again to know that my gut was right all along.  This is the wrong man for the job of leader of the free world! (which, by the way, we are not any more.)This month, in a string of upsetting stories (as if the threat of a nuclear war with North Korea and making friendly nations adversaries while admiring our historical adversaries ... if that wasn't enough), I saw a video clip where Trump was admiring the North Korean dictator's followers - all those people who sit up and take notice when their dictator speaks.  Setting aside the fact this dictator will kill you if you don't 'sit up and take notice,' our President (in his own words - on tape so that there can be no misunderstanding) wants \"his people\" to do the same for him.  The President's interpreters wanted us to think he was \"joking.\"  Joking - no one with two brain cells would believe that after the last year.  Then the stories of immigrant children being separated at the border from their parents.  And from the UN yesterday - we have withdrawn our representation on the UN Human Right's Counsel. And that, folks, was just this last month! I am just done. I can't continue to watch our country sink to a new low - every single week - for another 3 years.  I have all the information I need to confirm that my gut was absolutely correct in 2016.So I am building my own wall - a virtual wall to separate me from the grim drama in our government and the man who creates it.  I am banishing all Trump information as much as possible - from my life.  I have seen enough to know that I will vote against him and against anyone who supports him.  I don't need to hear more.   I deleted all Facebook postings (including a few 'friends') from my newsfeed ... people who routinely push Trump stories.  I will not forward any more Trump posts on Facebook.  I just add to the stress of others by doing so.  I no longer watch CNN. I agree with their point of view, but it is Trump, Trump, Trump - 24/7!  Just can't have a steady diet of it anymore.And I will take the only action available to me - I will vote!It must look to some like I am sticking my head in the sand.  They would argue that all citizens remain continually informed and ready to fight against America's wanna-be dictator.  They believe keeping the electorate in a constant of agitation and frustration is the way toward change.  Maybe ... I hope so.But for me personally, and for my own health and peace of mind, I must look at this situation through a different lens.  I will vote.  I will encourage everyone to VOTE.  My elected representatives already reflect my point of view.   They are doing what needs to be done: RESIST.  In fact, our Governor, Larry Hogan, (a Republican Governor in Democratic Maryland) has pulled our National Guard Troops and a helicopter from the Texas border until the current policy of separating immegrant children from parents is changed. Thank you Governor Hogan.  It isn't a large gesture because our commitment wasn't that big.  But it is a stand and a statement!  Governor Hogan has my vote.  I look for other states to take the same stand.Voting - the only tool I have.  I leave all the rest to younger more energetic citizens. VOTE is my mantra!And as for my wall ...  for the record - I am not asking for anyone else to 'pay' for it or to join me in building one.  What I am asking of everyone is toVOTE everyone!! VOTE!Stepping down off my soap box now.  I won't be tarnishing my blog with his name ever again.VOTEAn apology and a disclaimer:My apologies to any readers who are ardent Trump supporters.  It is not my aim to make your position somehow wrong.  But, this is my blog, and my peace of mind has been negatively affected by this elected official and I have a right to express my opinion on it - on bended knee if I choosebecause the Constitution allows it ... at least at this point it does."},

He did not throw a tantrum - that would have been the quickest way to defeat - he knew that!  I remember him pleading towards my sympathies. There was no other eagle in the display.  This 'baby' needed a friend.  We couldn't just leave him there.  Who would take care of him.   And so on and so on and so on.   He was so sincere and I could tell he was near tears over this obvious abandonment of a baby eaglet!  (Remember folks, this is a stuffed animal.  Just to hammer the point home - it is still a baby stuffed animal 37 years later!!)  But, no matter.  My son had instantly bonded emotionally with the plight of this poor baby eagle.Now it should be stated clearly ... I am not heartless.  I bought that baby eaglet (stuffed animal) ... my son took good care of him AND, after my son had outgrown his stuffed animals, that baby eaglet survived my purge of stuff - actually several purges of stuff - right up to the move to the condo.This past weekend we took our adult children and our grand daughter out to eat - celebratory for an anniversary and a birthday.  I brought the eaglet to the dinner for Eskarina!And when I pulled it out of the bag, my son got a small smile on his face.Priceless!  Well worth the cost paid 37 years ago!I do it again in a heart beat!!!"},

Korea!!  KOREA!!  I should have ask Trump to bring one back with him.And the repairman suspects that the reason we keep getting the wrong number - an 07 board - is because LG refrigerators are built in Korea (except when they aren't) and the 07 is a substitute for the 01 which is what we need.  Ours was built in Mexico and just won't accept the substitute board of 07. If it isn't an 01 - it won't make our fridge run.  Everyone still with me?Actually the only thing that is important for you (and for us if we are forced to buy another unit), is that when buying appliances, buy brands like GE or Frigidaire.  As the repairman remarked - really, everything being produced now is trash - even if the consumer ratings are very high (like ours was), and it is better to get a unit where replacement parts are easy to get.Yesterday we went food shopping.  It was a challenge an adventure.  Buy only enough fresh veggies for 2 or 3 days.  Buy only items that are packaged and don't need refrigeration.  Buy only the smallest  containers so that once it is opened, it is used up and doesn't need to go on ice.For dinner tonight??Hamburger Helper!  Yes, I am reduced to Hamburger Helper.  (My apologies to anyone who buys and enjoys this.  We used to have this when I didn't know how to cook.  It was pretty wooden then.  Doubt things have improved.)  This one is called Salisbury Steak.  We will have a tossed salad and some crusty bread with butter.I am planning on topping dinner off with a stiff Vodka Tonic!  Over ice!!Maybe two!"},

Crochet is one of those non-knitting project offenders.  The first project was called The Island Playset and here is the link to that project.  I owned the pattern for a year before I had a special little boy (a grand nephew born in 2017) that I could make it for.  When I started it I had to relearn crochet.  I had to put ice on my left thumb to stop the pain.  I had to have this project so I pushed on.This year a second project caught my eye called The Zookeeper's Blanket.  My eyes said \"Ohhh.  You must do this.\"  My thumb said \"Hell, no.  I am warning you.\"This is the Zookeeper's Blanket as created by the designer.I have already identified 3 animals that I will not make because I think I can find better ideas.But the blanket, even as shown, is darling.\"Caught my eye\" is really downplaying its impact on me.  I purchased it right away.  No thought.  Must have!  Must make.  Must set my knitting aside (did I just say that??).  And a worthy recipient, my darling grand daughter, was already on hand.  Is this Kismet or WHAT!Now here is what I objectively think about crochet ...Love the lookNot good at it.Hurts my left thumb.Struggle with the instructions.Not relaxing.Hurts my left thumb.  Able to make designs/shapes not easily made in knittingGreat for toys and blanketsNot so good for wearables.Hurts my left thumb.But I wanted this Zookeeper's Blanket -  I pulled out my hooks and my crochet cheat sheet and plunged in.  Low and behold - I found I was enjoying the process.  Actually excited about the blocks that were developing from my hands ... now I am looking for yarns to use that would add color and texture ... and ... pushing myself to develop some animals that weren't part of the original pattern just because I think I can.My lobster block.Feels like the Crochet Fairy dropped in and sprinkled me with her fairy dust!My bear block.Anyway, I hope you enjoy the pictures of my progress and where I am going with this blanket in the future.My octopus block.The down side of this project is there are lots of colors and shapes.  Lots and lots of ends to weave in.  Lots of sewing.  A very fiddly pattern.  I usually hate all that, but because of the fairy dust - I am not having a problem.  As others who completed this pattern noted:  The pattern has a lot of ends to weave in - but it is worth it.  I agree.My cat block.The blocks are so darn cute, when I finish one I can't wait to start another one.Sample of another's interpretation of the project using all sheep and one dog.So darn cute.And what I love most of all is seeing the originality of others who have done this pattern.  Some used one theme - many sheep and one dog.  Very cute.The sample the crocheter made up some of her own animalsnot used in the original.Some alternated animal blocks with plain blocks.  That is my choice because I don't care for some of the animals in the original pattern.  So unless I can find some replacements (which I have), the blanket would be too small.  And alternating with plain blocks allows for less ends to weave in - and a focus on the cutest animals.My grand daughter's room is done in green.  My plain blocks are green.This picture gives a sense of how I will put my blocks together.Some crocheters suggest putting a backing on this blanket since one side is cute and the other side is - well, not cute.  I am actually considering that!!  Crazy but I always hated extra steps that didn't involve knitting - like linings and extra sewing.  That darn crochet fairy dust is powerful stuff.An original design, a butterfly, created by a crocheter.Hoping to copy this one. And my thumb??  I think the fairy dust has healed it.I wonder if there is fairy dust for cleaning your house.  Or fairy dust for cooking dinner night after night after night!!  Or can I send that fairy off to my exercise classes for me - and bring back the benefits while I sit making this blanket??If you think you have the answers to these question (and they involve common sense) don't bother saying them out loud.  Fairy dust has blocked any reality checks!My deadline: - Christmas."},

My history with plants is just awful.I have left many dead plants in my wakeOnce (long, long ago) I had an 8' x 8' foot space in a rented community garden.  My plot was a plant grave yard.  The plots around me flourished.  I took that as a sign - 'you are a plant killer.'Our next townhome was surrounded by trees.  No sun ever.  When we landscaped our postage stamp size lot - I told the landscaper ... select plants that will live in spite of me.  He did.  We had to pay someone yearly to fight them into submission.  Those plants were not my success being chosen and planted by plant pros.  Plants on my deck never survived.  Not enough sun?  Not the right plants?  Too much water?  Not enough water?  The secrets of plants totally escapes me.Now I am in a condo.  No rented garden space and deck so small that more than 2 people on it is a crowd scene.  BUT I have 12 hours of full sun on that deck.  I started thinking ... maybe, just maybe.Despite my poor plant parenting ... I totally love nurseries.  All those flowering plants bursting with health and promise.  So off I went.  This time I was careful to read all the plant tags to get something hardy and that likes full sun  While I was there I noticed something called \"patio tomatoes.\"  A vegetable.  hmmm ...Not too big at this point.  'Patio' ... designed for small spaces maybe?  So along with some flowering plants - a patio tomato plant came home with me as well.  As we left the nursery, I felt like I needed to apologize in advance to these plants that they wound up with 'plant killer' me.  I promised to do my best - without mentioning that my 'best' killed other plants.Soon I noticed this.Flowers ... maybe (one) tomato was in my future.  Success!  The tomato plant is not dying!! But then I noticed peeking below the flowers  a green tomato!  Ok, maybe I will get two tomatoes.  Happy Dance!Before I knew it, I had multiple green tomatoes and they had all gotten bigger!!!  Last count was 18 actual green tomatoes!  Holy Cow.  This is unheard of ... (small panic).  Its still early in the growing season. Tomatoes EVERYWHERE!!Ok, the secret to growing plants - at least for me - is to apologize in advance!  They seem to love a penitent owner.  Well ... that and a sign in my kitchen to remind me of my responsibilities ...Here are some other beauties on my deck - still living I will point out.If all goes well this year ... I think I will plant some herbs in pots next year.  I love fresh herbs like parsley, cilantro and basil. What other kinds of edible plants work well on decks?"},
{"title": "The Pull of the Moon", "date": "Saturday, June 9, 2018", "text": "Recently I have been cleaning out my Kindle of books I probably will never read.  Scanning the book summary of each book - and deleting a bunch of them.  Many were free and sounded interesting at the time I selected them.  But now they seem trite and repetitive.  Whatever was I thinking ... was the thought that passed my brain over and over.And then I came to this title:The Pull of the Moon by Elizabeth BergThe publisher's summary read like this:***Uncomfortable with the fit of her life, now that she's in the middle of it, Nan gets into her car and just goes--driving across the country on back roads, following the moon; and stopping to talk to people.  Through conversations with women, men, with her husband through letters, and with herself through her diary, Nan confronts topics long overdue for her attention.  She writes to her husband and says things she's never admitted before; and she discovers how the fabric of her life can be reshaped into a more authentic creation.***This book has been waiting on my Kindle since 2015.  I read the summary and a little pull made me select it again - this time to read now.As I read, I found myself relating strongly with Nan, the 50 year old woman who it seemed was having a mid-life crisis of some sort.  But early on I realized this was not a crisis at all.  It was a breaking out, a leap for freedom, a search of the self, ... a self she had ignored for so long.  Then a quote leaped off the page and pointed a finger straight at me.***\"Most women are full to the brim.  I think we are most of us ready to explode, especially when our children are small and we are so weary with the demands for love and attention and the kind of service that makes you feel you should be wearing a uniform with \"Mommy\" embroidered over the left breast, over the heart. ... It wasn't that I was really unhappy.  It was the constancy of my load and the awesome importance of it; and it was my isolation. ... I see now, there were internal earthquakes wanting to happen all the time.\"***But, YES!  That was me.  Most of my adult life.  It was me.  Except the word I would substitute for the embroidered \"Mommy\" label would be \"Caregiver.\"  Caregiver was not a life role I ever aspired to.  True ... I chose to be a parent - and wouldn't change that role ever!!  The reward for being a parent caregiver is the wonderful adult children I have today.  But the \"caregiver\" role continued to follow me.  First it was my husband's grandmother.  My husband was her only living relative.  Of course we would care for her.  Then it was my mother-in-law.  My husband had no other blood family but his mom, so yes I would care for her.  Then my own mother started to fail and she needed an advocate ... a caregiver!  A no brainer - my mom needed assistance and I could not turn away.  I never thought twice about that choice.  In fact, I never thought twice about any of those decisions.Now I am 71, and I feel a 'short-timer' in my life.  Oh, I plan to live as many years as God intends, but to be frank and realistic,  I certainly have more years behind me - than ahead of me! In fact, my body tells me this is true.My caregiving role, however, continues to haunt me even now.  My husband is now legally blind.  Going blind late in life makes becoming a 'skilled' visually impaired person, pretty darn hard.  He needs more of me now than ever.The Pull of the Moon hit a major nerve for me.  I have actually thought about just getting in the car and driving away.  It has crossed my mind a lot more than I care to admit.  When the summary said Nan did just that ... drove away ... I thought - see, this isn't such an abnormal crazy thing to do.  Like Nan, I would not describe myself as unhappy.  But I do often feel that I am \"full to the brim.\"  \"Explode\" also comes to mind at times.  In fact, I started this blog back in 2007 as a way to keep from exploding.  The words \"constancy of my load\" and \"importance of it\" and \"isolation,\"  ... well, folks, this book is me.Do you ever feel the way Nan does?  Would you ever jump in the car and just drive off?  I won't, of course.  The hardship my absence for my husband and the worry it would cause my family would be too great a guilt for me to live with.   But I do fantasize about doing that. And that is all I would do - fantasize, because just jumping in the car at 71 and driving off is totally unrealistic.  Think of it - I would need to pack all my pills and eye meds, and ace bandages and cold wraps for my knee ... and my pillow. 😀 I would have to rent a trailer to pack all my knitting paraphernalia, of course!!! 😂😂😂  My computer, iPhone, Kindle and iPad need to come as well - with all the chargers. 😝😝😝😝😝. I can't eat a lot of restaurant food any more - heartburn, you know.  So I would have to pack a cooler!   😜😜😜😜😜😜😜 Ha!  Barriers everywhere!Why didn't Nan have to do all that stuff?  Simple: she is only 50!!!!*sigh*Guess I missed my window of opportunity for this adventure.  So I am left with living vicariously through Nan.  My advice to Nan?  YOU GO GIRL!!!I recommend this book.  Good writing, interesting story line, thoughtful observations and a really good  woman-to-woman book about our journey as females."},

{"title": "Ok, Ok ...", "date": "Monday, April 30, 2018", "text": "😋I know.  I've been missing in action AGAIN!I did hear from a few readers that I was missed!  Ha.  One, and I won't name names - even asked me face to face, \"So where are you?\" ... to which I resisted the obvious \"Right in front of you.\"I just go into dips on this blogging thing it appears ... especially when my life seems to be sailing along evenly - without drama and disaster.Of course, this winter was very eventful.  One of the biggest events of my life.  I officially became of a grandmother of a being with 2 legs!  While this statement sounds a bit odd, those who know me personally know that I have been a grandmother to 4 legged mutts for many many years.  They know me by the title of 'gran-ma.' My grand daughter, Eskarina Faye, was born February 25 - 7 lbs, 7 ounces.  It has been such a joy to see her grow and develop so quickly. Eskarina while still in the hospital.  Pretty wide awake here.But don't be fooled.  There was a lot of sleeping too.My husband and I with Esk at our condo soon after discharge.You can be sure I will be sharing more pictures of this little dumpling as she grows. I do get some questions about her name.  It is unusual.  A little explanation.My son and daughter-in-law are big fans of the English author, Terry Pratchett.  I think I mentioned this author in connection with a chest of drawers my son painted for his soon to be born daughter.  You can find that post here.  Terry Pratchett is the author of over 40 comic fantasy books that occur in  a universe called Discworld.  Discworld is a flat world carried by four elephants riding on the back of a giant turtle.  Here is a link that explains things better than I could.  It is a charming set of books and I have read a few of them.Eskarina's name comes from a novel in that series called Equal Rites.  The back cover gives a summary. Every world has its rules - even a flat one carried by four elephants riding on a giant turtle.  That's why a dying wizard is searching for an eighth son of an eighth son to bestow his wizardly powers upon before meeting Death in six minutes.  Unfortunately it is quickly discovered - though not quite quickly enough - that the newborn babe the wizard anoints just before bidding the Discword adieu is, in reality, a girl! What's done cannot be undone - despite old Granny Weatherwax's attempts to bring the child into the witchy fold - little Esk is now a wizard, through and through.It is an interesting novel in today's world where equal rights for women continues to be an issue.   I think the book's play on words is fun - rites vs rights - and the fact that Eskarina is a wizard in a world where only men can be wizards is a timely topic.So here is my little Esk about a week ago.Pretty much everyone agrees she has her mother's mouth and her dad's nose and eyes. But we all know how this goes.  She will change many times as she develops.She is a cute little nugget and I am one lucky 'gran-ma.'That's all 'till next time."},
{"title": "Coming Clean: A Memoir by Kimberly Rae Miller", "date": "Sunday, January 28, 2018", "text": "Photo Credit: AmazonAmazon Product Description:Kimberly Rae Miller is an immaculately put together woman with a great career, a loving boyfriend and a beautifully tidy apartment in Brooklyn.  You would never guess that behind the closed doors of her family's idyllic Long Island house hid teetering stacks of aging newspaper, broken computers and boxes upon boxes of unused junk festering in every room - the product of her father's painful and unending struggle with hoarding.In this dazzling memoir, Miller brings to life her experience growing up in a rat-infested home, hiding her father's shameful secret from friends for years, and the emotional burden that ultimately led to her suicide attempt.  In beautiful prose, Miller sheds light on her complicated yet loving relationship with her parents, which has thrived in spite of the odds.I downloaded this audiobook out of curiosity, free with Kindle Unlimited.  It focuses on a mental condition that has been highlighted in the TV series The Hoarders.  The TV series - as with most shows that seek to obtain and maintain a viewing audience - showcases the most extreme cases of hoarding - always escalating the cases with each season.  I watched the show until it began to slip into animal hoarding and the sad state of the hoarder and the terrible outcomes for the animals they kept.  I couldn't watch any longer.  It greatly tore at my heart.  But when I found this book, I was drawn to it as it seemed to focus on the struggle and the love that this family had for each other - while dealing with this affliction.I didn't expect such a sensitive and touching story.  The author reads this story in the audiobook.  Since it was her own story, I felt comfortable with her reading style. I felt compassion for her as she struggled to pull away from her upbringing while not abandoning her parents. Her supportive love for them was apparent.  The parents love for their daughter was equally demonstrated but it did not overcome the strong hold of hoarding behavior.  There is no simple resolution at the end of the story despite all their efforts, but acceptance, love and continued family loyalty provided a realistic ending to this memoir - something that was missing from all The Hoarders TV shows I watched.I recommend this book to anyone who wants a better understanding of this mental problem."},

{"title": "Big Deep Breath", "date": "Sunday, January 7, 2018", "text": "Its been a busy day.Last night was the last 'hurrah' for Christmas in our house.  We host an after holiday Christmas party for a group of friends we see monthly during the year for gaming.  Whatever the first weekend in January is after the New Year ... that is the date of this party.  I'd love to dismantle Christmas before the New Year - but I hold off until this event is past.As I put away Christmas for another year, I like to think of the weeks following as a 'purge' time.  The fact I purged greatly 17 months ago to move into this condo doesn't change the fact that stuff still travels in the front door all the time, and if, on balance, stuff doesn't travel out the front door - the clutter builds.  And it is building and building.So here is the path I'll travel from one task to another:My hands are all over Christmas decos and because there are still things that never get displayed - they need to be thinned.  Then we move onto the single storage closet I have where Christmas is stored.  Christmas stuff is stored to the back, and I need to pull a lot of stuff out.  Once it is out of the closet - I decide if it goes back in.  That darn closet is next to impossible to step into now. In 6 or 7 weeks a grandchild will grace our lives.  Room to be made - literally.  I have a guest room/yarn room with a closet.   That space is packed.  Some stuff hasn't been touched in 17 months.  My grand daughter will fit comfortably in my condo when I am done.  For months I have hated opening my two bathroom linen closets.  Again, again, again - if it hasn't been used in 17 months it needs to go out the door.Lastly the kitchen! My pantry is packed to the max.  Reorganize and consolidate.  Because it is such a mess - I find myself buying stuff I already have.  grrr ....  And those kitchen shelves,  generous space for sure ... and because nature abhors a vacuum I filled that space.  Not always a good thing.See how one thing just leads to another?  I hope I can welcome the spring with a clean slate.  (I can hear the snickers now - 'first day of spring - in which year.')  To my nay sayers ... goals are good. So let's say I pick Spring 2018 to finish - yes, this year.All these tasks are the perfect winter activity when you are not distracted by all the things that grab your attention outdoors.When all this gets done - then I can take a breath.  A big deep breath, once again - until the future incoming stuff begins to chip away at my contentment and I am forced to walk this way again."},
{"title": "The Heel Slide", "date": "Thursday, January 4, 2018", "text": "A major development!!A major positive development!!The best kind of development.I guess the title of this post  gives it away.  No?  Well for those still in the dark, let me share a little bit of the back story on the Heel Slide. Anyone who has had work done on their knee probably has come up against the heel slide exercise.  Heel slides help you regain your range of motion in the knee after an injury or surgery.  Basically, you lay on your back like the lady in the picture with one leg extended straight, and the other leg is brought to your butt as close as you can.  My therapist, Sarah, instructed me to use a strap around my ankle to help pull the heel as much as possible to the butt with the help of your hands.Looks simple, right?  It can be, but it can also be difficult - (translation: hurts like hell.).  This woman obviously didn't have surgery - her face is peaceful.  She is not swearing.So, since mid-May I couldn't do this with my left knee.  I could pull my right knee up to my butt, but the left knee - got about as far as the picture lady is before tears formed in my eyes.Anyway all summer and fall this self-torture activity was part of my routine.  As I healed my therapist took measurements of the angle my leg made - and the sharper the angle, the more improvement until I was \"within normal range for my age.\"  (There's that \"for my age\" crap again!).When I knew I was nearing discharge I had a serious talk with my lovey therapist, Sarah - who by the way has a doctorate in this stuff - and is not a wilting lilly about inflicting pain if it helps healing.  (I hated that part.)The conversation went something like this:Me:        \"Sarah, watch this.\"  (I bent my right knee to my butt, I could touch my right heel with my                right fingers.)Sarah:    \"Yes, Elaine, that is excellent, more than is expected.\"Me:        \"Now watch this.\"  (I bent my left knee to my butt.  There was still a great divide between                heel and fingers.)Sarah:   \"Right - but your flexion in that left knee is within normal range.               (... for a person of your age - which she didn't say, but I was thinking.)Me:       \"So, Sarah, last night I was watching a Christmas Special with the Radio City Rockettes.\"Sarah:    (small eye roll with grin).  \"I can hardly wait to hear where this is going.  And ...\"Me:       \"Well, I noticed during one of their routines, they could all touch their heels to their butts.\"               (It is not important that I explain to you how I know, but trust me on this.  They could.)Sarah:   \"Yes, I imagine they could.\"Me:        \"So ...?\"Sarah:    \"But you are within normal range for your ....\"  (oh, you know the rest.)Thinking back on the conversation I guess I could look at the glass as half full - and say my right leg is 'Radio City Rockette worthy.'  I am pretty sure one leg is not good enough to make the Rockette line up.I was discharge from PT the beginning of December - with one leg more normal than the other (see I can be positive.)   That status was fine with the doctor and fine with the therapist and fine with Medicare and Blue Cross who paid for all those months of PT.Now to the reason I am sharing all this with you! (I know you were wondering.)On New Year's Eve I was doing my exercises while watching TV.  (I am just a party animal, you know.). The last exercise on my list is the Heel Slide.  I start with the right leg (one that can reach my butt).  Want to be sure that my right leg doesn't get any ideas about what is \"normal for my age.\"Then I did my left leg, reaching with my left fingers to find my heel (which I haven't been able to accomplish all year) ... and the two met - fingers and heels.  AND with NO swearing!  None at all.  Shock!  Took a small moment to make sure I was exercising the surgery knee - I most definitely was! I jumped up.  (I use the term 'jump' loosely - but I did get up.)  I had to tell someone.  My husband was already in bed - and asleep!  And then I realized, the person I had to tell was Sarah.  My husband would have said, \"Oh, that's nice.\"  But Sarah ... she would have understood.  I shot an email off to her. And, as I expected, Sarah was appropriately excited!!Now I should mention, that the left knee is not really 'Radio City Rockette ready' - the heel isn't touching my butt yet!  But it is only a matter of time.New Goal for 2018 - BECOME THE FIRST 70 YEAR OLD RADIO CITY ROCKETTE!Or ... maybe I will just accept the fact I could be a Rockette if I wanted to. Can your heels touch your butt?  Could you be a Rockette?"},
{"title": "I looked in the mirror!", "date": "Tuesday, January 2, 2018", "text": "It is amazing how easy it is to deceive yourself ... especially if you don't look into a mirror!  Really look, not just glance while brushing your teeth or combing your hair.In an effort to keep my exercise program interesting and well balanced I finally opened a DVD set purchased maybe 2 years ago.  Yes, yes ... 2 years!  Sealed up in plastic just like new, it was.I do this little mind game thing ... get stuff and own it ... and somehow believe that ownership alone is is enough to absorb the knowledge or benefit of the item without actually reading or viewing or doing the whatever ... in this case doing the exercises. Anyway, the DVD is Stronger Seniors. Workout Program with Anne Pringle Burnell.The cover stated - \"Safe & Easy to Follow.  Increase Stamina.  Strength training for upper and lower body.  Improve Balance.\"  See what I mean ... no where does it say you have to actually DO this stuff.Anyway, I need everything this DVD proclaims, so to avoid boredom with my regular routine, I decided to try this out.  I broke the plastic on the DVDs.The very first thing I noticed was that the 5 or 6 folks behind the instructor were old.  The second thing I thought was ... I bet this DVD set will be too easy for me.  After all, look at the participants.  They will need a slow and gentle exercise routine, and I can certainly do more.I launched into the first disk (Stretch).  At first it was slow, but it picked up steam.  And I kept up.  Each disk was 60 minutes.  The instructions suggested alternating these disks on separate nights.  Well, of course, if you are older you need to alternate nights.  Me, not so much.On the first disk I noticed I was actually getting a work out.  I pealed off my sweater.  I was getting warm.  I completed the 60 minutes pretty well - and it did target my upper body which needs more of everything. I checked out the second disk (Strength and Balance).  I needed both.  I started the second work out.  It was also a pretty good work out - using weights.  I was using 3 pounds weights.  I noticed some of the participants were using 4 pounds weights.  (Heck - I don't have 4 pound weights.  I need to buy those.  In fact I will buy 5 pound weights. No one was using 5 pounds!!)  But as the program proceeded, I noticed some of the movements were uncomfortable in my right shoulder.  I backed down the routine to no weights on the right side.  Of course, the DVD participants who were following the instructor (using 4 pound weights, no less) continued on with no apparent effort.  *sigh*Hmmm ... I am younger than those folks ... I should be able to do this with no effort!Finally I moved on to the Balance section.  I was starting to get tired.  I was very sure the DVD folks  must be tired too.  Of course, they had their game face on, so I put my game face on (even though there was no one to see it but the cat.)And then it got serious.I am pretty good at balancing with two legs.  (In September I wasn't good at balancing period.  I used a walker and then a cane.  Two legs now is a step up.)  I am less confident with one leg.  But I charged on with everyone else knowing I could do this.  At some point I looked at the DVD participants ... you know ... the 'older' folks in the background.  No one, and I mean absolutely NO ONE, was struggling with the balance portion of the program.  They performed the exercises with steady feet and ankles, no support required of chair near by, and no swearing!  Meanwhile, back in my living room, my feet and ankles gamely tried to keep me upright.  They were wobbly, constantly adjusting to keep me from falling.  My hands, that were firmly instructed to not touch the chair, did so anyway.  And swearing!  Lots and lots of swearing.  The cat left the room!I completed the second DVD.  It wasn't pretty.  And when I passed the bathroom mirror later in the evening, I noticed that the living room participant was ... well ... not in her 50s or 60s.   Somehow my eyes blinded my brain to the fact I am older.  Darn!  How had I missed that!So - ok!  I will used these disks 'cause I apparently need them.  I will admire those DVD participants who are able to do ALL the exercises with strength and skill (and no swearing.)  And I will believe what the mirror is telling me - that I am a senior who needs to get stronger like the folks in the DVD.I believe there is a biblical lesson about 'pride and falling' buried in this post! 😀And, by the way, this DVD set is very good.  I don't know why I waited 2 years to break the seal and open it. Oh, that's right!That mind game about owning and not doing may have had something to do with that!"},
{"title": "2018 Craft Plans", "date": "Monday, January 1, 2018", "text": "While I make a point of avoiding New Year's Resolutions, I do feel that creating a list of to-dos is helpful in planning yearly crafting activities.  There are so many things I would like to do and try.  If I don't make a list ... it doesn't get done. Actually that is simple truth for me - no list, no focus.  List making is something I do without thought - just like breathing.  Do I accomplish everything I write down?  No.  But it shows what is important in the end.  Unimportant things just slip from day to day - and sometime disappear.Over December I gave quite a bit of time to thinking about 2018 crafting: knitting, crochet, spindle spinning and, maybe this year, a needlepoint project.  Those items fleshed out they look like this:KnittingRed hoodie for my grand daughter - almost complete now - for next ChristmasA cable sweater for my grand nephew - for next ChristmasA knitted toy for my grand daughter - for next ChristmasA summer something for my grand daughter.Baby blanket for my grand daughter - because a knitter who does not create a baby blanket for her own grand daughter is in conflict with the knitting gods.A sweater for myself - using some wonderful yarn I purchased for Christmas 2016 - this to-do will not slip off my list.Another shawl - with beads - for my daughter-in-law.Another shawl - with beads - for my daughter.Crochet Amigurumi toys - at least give it a try.  I have this book on order.  Cute!SpinningSpindle spinning still calls to me.  I have several spindles and many wonderful options regarding fiber.  Creating the yarn will be the full goal - not what I plan to do with it.NeedlepointDuring the 1980s I did a number of needlepoint project and enjoyed it greatly.  Now as my son and daughter-in-law prepare to welcome a daughter into their world by creating the nursery, I feel very inclined to create a needlepoint picture for her room. I am actively looking for a needlepoint canvas of a dragon or wizard to match the theme of the room.  Selecting the canvas and the yarns and working on the actual project will take some time - probably ending in a finished project some in 2019.  So this list of things is stored here on my blog - so next year at this time I can see just how many are achieved.I don't make resolutions.  I do, however, enjoy visiting the blogs where people publish their resolutions.  To me resolutions are not so much goal setting and achieving ... resolutions reflect our desire to be someone different than we are now - or improve qualities that we already have but have not 'fed' recently. In recent years I followed the blog trend of picking a single word and seeing how closely I could live my life to demonstrate of that word.In 2016 I picked the word - Move!  I wanted to be more physically active.  I don't know about physical activity - be we did move - in 2016 - and it did require a great deal of physical activity on my part.  I guess that counts even if not planned that way.In 2017 I picked the word - Consistency.  I wanted good habits performed more consistently.  In truth, I promptly forgot that word as I got into 2017.  I couldn't even guess what it was until I looked it up for this post.  Certainly exercise was a good habit I wanted this past year.   Looking back I did consistently exercise - joining The Y last January and being dedicated to my PT exercises since June.  So what to do about 2018!I won't be doing 'Resolutions' nor picking a 'Word' to thread through my year.  If I learned anything from my life in 2017 - it is that regardless of any goals or intentions I have - the future will happen regardless of my plans for it, and I will be responding.But the question that keeps rising to the surface is: who will I be in 2018?Health: The events of 2017 set me back.  This body is good for only a fixed period of time, and I want to be sure it is functional for ALL that time.  So I am continuing what I started in 2017 - to maintain and improve this body through regular activity. Distractions: As in previous years - I need to start decluttering again.   Objects for me are distractions and the condo has started to feel full.  All the downsizing I did allowed me to move from 2200 square feet space into 1375 feet space in 2016.  Someday I may need to shrink even more - maybe into a single room.  What I do now will minimize what my children may be forced to do on my behalf in the future.   Objects are half the battle.  Time is the other half.  The clutter of an overly busy calendar can be stressful. Grandchild:  This will be a new adventure!  One that I can hardly wait to begin.  Keep healthy for a grandchild.Make space and time for a grandchild.Those are the words that will guide me in 2018!Who will you be in 2018?"},
{"title": "New Year's Eve Reflection - 2017", "date": "Sunday, December 31, 2017", "text": "I like to look back at the previous year - to check out all the shiny parts and the warts - and then file those memories away and start the next year new.Before I began this post - I checked back on my reflection of 2016 and I summed up the year by answering 20 questions.  It was fun.  This year feels different so I am going to use a few emojis.😱. In January we got a new President.  *sigh*  I try to avoid political topics in my blog.  But a face 'screaming in fear' seemed to be the only emoji that seemed to sum up my reaction to Trump as our President.  And as of December 31, 2017 - this man has done nothing in his first year in office to change my mind.  Screaming fear of what he will do to our country and our future haunts me.  I thank God in my prayers that our founding fathers had the good sense to create 3 branches of government - to act as checks and balances for 'mistakes' - for he truly is a mistake, one that we must survive  ... hopefully.😌. In April I turned 70!  I thought a 'relieved' face seemed the best choice for that birthday.  Although I still have problems with the size of that number ... I am pleased to have reach it and I hope for many more years in this life.  You only get to go around once - so I am relieved to have reached 70 and I want to complete the circle and not get cut short.😞. In May I awoke one morning to a sore swollen knee.  I had problems with this knee in 2013 - and it resolved with PT - but not this time.  Eight weeks of PT and I still walked with a cane.  I think 'sad' face fits this extended event that ate up my summer.😿. In June our dear dear Max died.  Max was one of two cats, brothers actually.  For 9 years of his life we treated him for degenerative kidney disease with fluids to flush his kidneys.  At age 11 he lost his battle with that disease, but he was a bit of a success story - as most cats don't last that long.  It never is easy to say goodbye.  We miss him still.  However his brother, Wally, seems to have come out of his shell and is an entirely different cat ... friendly, outgoing, enjoying life completely.  Go figure.  Guess they weren't as close as we thought.💝. In July my son and his wife announced they were expecting a child.  HOLY COW!  I am going to be a grandmother!  Me!  I had given up that hope a while back.  A heart wrapped in a bow seemed to sum up this wondrous news.  And it is still a bit unbelievable to me, despite the fact my daughter-in-law is clearly growing another person inside her body.  February can't come fast enough for us.😡.  In September, after 8 weeks of PT - with minimal improvement - an MRI revealed that the left knee had a miniscus tear and could only be fixed with surgery.  In some ways it felt like I had wasted my summer and that was frustrating.  But now I had a real diagnosis, so taking a positive action to fix the problem - well - it changed my angry face into 😐 - neutral face!  Get the darn thing fixed!😁. In October and November I was back in PT and improving.  But the beauty of recovery was that I now had time to knit and knit and knit - to my heart's content.  And I finished a large number of projects.  During that time I realized that despite my sampling of other related crafts (weaving and spinning) over the years, knitting continues to be my true love.  💗💖💟💖. Without knitting I would be lost.  My knee might not be fully functional, but my hands are fine - I can knit!💪. In December I was discharged from PT.  I am better, but not perfect.  I am working towards perfect - and both the doctor and the therapist said it might take a year.  In the meantime, I am doing my exercises,  going to the gym and joining an exercise class in January.  When this knee finally starts feeling like the other knee, all the other parts of my body will be up to speed as well.That was my 2017!  Highs and lows.  Normal really.  I will say that after this year - I understand better what physical set backs do to a senior citizen.  This knee repair was minor, but it set me back more than I care to admit, and the struggle to regain what was lost just takes more time at this age.I have often started and stopped exercise programs over the years.  This time the seeds that I have planted in 2017 to improve my health I will continue to cultivate in 2018.  Now I don't feel I have a choice - not if I want to continue to live a normal life!Goodbye 2017!I learned a few lessons from you this year.Who knows what 2018 will teach me.💞"},
{"title": "Made it!", "date": "Friday, December 29, 2017", "text": "Anyone who has read my blog for awhile knows that this holiday has become a hurdle I struggle to get passed.   By the time I get to the 27th or the 28th, I am thrilled to be passed another Christmas.I love the fact we are over 360 days away from the next Christmas.  I am happy to see the holiday decor begin to disappear from the stores and homes.  The holiday music that has been playing 24/7 on my favorite radio station (since before Thanksgiving, for gosh sakes), finally will revert to normal \"70,s 80's, 90's and hits of today.\"   I know, I know ... I hear whispers of \"grinch.\" Well, let me assure you.  I am not a grinch.  I value the holiday for what it should be - a celebration of the birth of Christ.  I love making someone smile with a specially chosen or hand made gift.  I find peace in an evening walk around my neighborhood to see the holiday lights.  But sadness does follow me. It hasn't always been that way.  If life delivers enough hard hits during the holidays ... it can change how you respond to them.  My dad died 3 days before Christmas in 1970.  My mom died 3 days after Christmas in 2014.  And in the last 10 years, my mom spent many holidays stuck in Assisted Living or a nursing home - because she was too disabled to get home.  I know neither parent would want those experiences to ruin my holidays.  The holidays aren't 'ruined,' but they are changed, and maybe permanently so.Looking up - this year's Christmas was easier than last year's Christmas  It was our second year in the condo.  I have stopped grieving the move from our townhouse of 30 years.  I still wish life hadn't made this move necessary. Stairs and a recently blind husband are just a bad combination.  So I am passed that loss and really appreciate the convenience of the condo.  I 'visit' my parents right after Christmas every year.  The trips are filled with less sorrow now and more just a flood of memories of my life with each of them.  I think it is good to allow those memories to surface (the good and the bad) - and to remember where I came from.  It gives me some comfort to know they are both beyond suffering now.  And we - as a family - are celebrating a soon to be born child.  Maybe this grand child will help heal some of those hard hits that make this season so hard for me.  Maybe life is finally giving me a mark in the positive column with a new little life to cherish.Regardless ...  This year ... I made it!  Passed another one!"},

{"title": "A Fearsome Guardian", "date": "Monday, December 18, 2017", "text": "A guardian at the door to my grand daughter's bedroom is this magnificent dragon.  He sits upon \"The Luggage,\" another guardian! (see previous post for an explanation of The Luggage.)The Dragon was purchased by my son at a toy store near where he works.  The store was going out of business and he got it for a reduced price, but I suspect he would have paid full price.In person, it is a pretty amazing figure.  Magnificent in his details.Just check out the wings - an impressive wing span I am sure.Fearsome teeth!  All the better to eat monsters!Massive feet - needs a pedicure, I think.  But those nails will rip any monster apart in a Nono-second!!  Scales are soft to the touch.  But don't be fooled. This guardian means business!Some of you might wonder why would we want to give a little girl a jumbo dragon ... even if he is a fine specimen and will serve as an excellent guard.  Well, the short answer is ... dragons are for girls.  Just look at The Game of Thrones TV series (also a series of books.)  That story includes 3 very serious fire breathing dragons and they belonged to a character called The Mother of Dragons - a girl! Ha!Truthfully, Dragons hold a rather large place of honor in my family.  My husband and a group of his friends play a monthly game similar to the original game of Dungeons and Dragons.  If you aren't familiar with that style of gaming, it is a story based game populated by imaginary characters that are created by those playing the game.  There is no board - but there are dice of various shapes and each person has a character sheet that describes his or her character's skills and attributes.  A 'dungeon master' or game leader - typically my husband - creates the fantasy world with a story line, goals and achievements.  Participants improve their characters' skills and attributes by gaining experience during the game - if they don't die, that is!   It is a game of the mind and the imagination.The original game of Dungeons and Dragons was created back in the 70s.  Our family and friends have met to play this game or similar versions of this game for all these years.  Our son and daughter-in-law are part of this group - and my son has played with this group since he was probably 7 years old. So a dragon is a perfectly normal thing to give to a girl whose father and grandfather have devoted so much time to.  Maybe when she is 7 years old, she may desire to pull up two chairs - one for herself and one for her dragon, and join in the game.  And if not, what better guardian could a little girl have than her own personal dragon to scare away the monsters!And besides,  it doesn't hurt that this dragon is darn cute!"},

It is made of sapient pearwood, and is immensely faithful. Its first owner was a tourist called Twoflower, who at the end of The Light Fantastic, gave the Luggage over to Rincewind. It appears to hold many dimensions, and has often swallowed people that have tried to hurt its owner.\"He shared this creation on Facebook - and in the explanation he said The Luggage was created to \"protect his baby girl from monsters.\"  And we all know directly from our own childhoods that monsters do hide under the beds of children if there is no one there to protect them. Looks like this bedroom will be safe from monsters!I have included a link below that provides further explanation regarding The Luggage.  If you are not familiar with Terry Pratchet and his Disc World Series you might get a better understanding by checking out this link.  I have read a few of the books and they are great fun.The Luggage"},
{"title": "An Unpleasant Truth, an Update, a Rant and Lessons Learned", "date": "Saturday, December 16, 2017", "text": "I knew about this unpleasant truth before my knee surgery.  I watched it play out in my mom's last years of life.The Unpleasant Truth:Simply stated, after a certain age, any major health event (like a surgery) can result in a negative impact on your previous function and energy levels. With my mom I called it ... \"a new normal.\"  Recovered ... but at a lower level than before.  While I watched this gentle downward slope occur in my mom after every illness, I simply would not believe it could happen to me.  I was younger and stronger (then), and as we all know - younger folks usually have a fixed (and sometimes unrealistic) opinion about their aging years.  So it was with me.  I would not give in, not give up, not stop trying ... I would not!  And I haven't, but ... now I actually am older.  My attitude is still stubbornly the same, but my body as other ideas.With this knee surgery, I may have experienced a little bit of that \"new normal\" and I am not happy about it.The Update:Two weeks ago I was discharged from Ortho care - I was recovered, and my flexibility and strength were \"within normal range for my age.\"  Translation?  You aren't in your 30s anymore.  Ha! I was fine with being discharged, but I countered the 'normal for my age' comment with ... I am not normal for where I was 6 months ago.  They said complete recovery will come with time.  But, I countered, will my left knee be as flexible as my right knee 'with time?'   \"Hmm,\" they responded, \"maybe.\"  That was not the answer I wanted.This week I was discharged from PT.  My progress has plateaued, I was doing well, and I will only \"improve with time and regular adherence to an exercise program.\" Ok, I am fine with that. Will I improve enough so that both knees are the same?  \"Maybe.\"Professional opinion?  It may be another 5 or 6 months before the symptoms resolve.  (Do I hear a 'maybe?')The Rant:Crap!  'Maybe' is such a weaselly word.  Not 'yes', not 'no', just somewhere in the middle?  or maybe yes? or maybe no?  Crap, crap.  I am just not a 'maybe' person.I want my left knee to be as good and my right knee. And I have done way more  over 6 months than just 'wish' that was so.  I was adamant from day one when I knew something wasn't right. I would get this condition fixed ... I wouldn't let it set me back.  Over 6 months I did the doctor thing ... the X-ray, meds thing ... the PT thing ... the MRI thing ... the surgery thing ... the PT thing, AGAIN.The Orthopod said my knees \"are great.\"  \"Fix this small problem and you will be good to go.\" BUT I am not 'good to go' yet!!  My knee still swells, gets stiff, hurts at times.  My left leg is not as strong as my right yet.  My general stamina is much reduced because I couldn't do aerobic exercise.   I can't sit too long, I can't stand too long, I can't walk too long!  I can't get down on the floor easily.This better not be my \"new normal.\"  I will know better in May - 6 months from now.Lessons learned:Avoid all optional surgeries if at all possible at any age, but certainly after 70.  Sometimes the 'fix' is not a 100% fix no matter what the medical professionals say.  I still would choose this surgery because now I don't walk with a cane anymore.  (That's one in the positive column.)Stay active - exercise, exercise, exercise, 'cause it doesn't take that much down time to set you way way back.  Be at least strong going into any medical procedure.  It can't hurt.The term 'new normal' is a misnomer.  It sounds somehow like an ok status.  It isn't!  The unpleasant truth:  'new normal' is really 'a step backwards.'  Ok, done!Time to close up the computer! I have exercises to do!  :-)Talk again soon!"},
{"title": "Girls vs Boys", "date": "Friday, December 15, 2017", "text": "The most important job I have ever done was raising two children into fine responsible adults.  I've done other jobs - some paid and some not - one of which includes 8 care giving years for my mom at the end of her life.  But raising children well tops the jobs list because it impacts our future as a community, a nation and a world. The raising of a grandchild carries that same level of importance, and when the grandchild is a girl - in today's world - there is one other point to consider.  Women are on the rise in our culture - the struggles are real - equality is not yet a reality, and it will take strong smart women in the future to move a culture in the right direction.When I was a second grade teacher, I really enjoyed watching the boys in my class.  So open, inquisitive, natural, daring, and often challenging in their approach to their environment - even if they knew they were going to get into trouble! I loved it.  On a rainy fall morning, as I watched the arriving children walking across the playground on their way to school, I spotted Terrence, one of my students.  He was decked out in a bright yellow slicker that covered him from under his chin to well below his knees.  Room for a growing boy - and it covered him completely.  He had matching rain boots on and a matching broad brimmed yellow rain hat that tied under his chin.  You could tell his mother made sure that this child of hers was going to arrive at school ... dry!  But she underestimated the powers of a 6 year old boy.  The playground had some low spots.  Big puddles.  He was drawn to those puddles like a magnet is drawn to the north pole.  I'll give him credit.  He stopped at the edge of a big puddle and looked at the water.  His mind radiated the message ... I am going to be in big trouble for this!  And then, with a big smile and much joy, jumped into that puddle stamping around until he was totally soaked. I remember smiling broadly with him.  I remember the other students giving him a wide berth in the playground, and I remember the astounded look on his mother's face when she had to bring dry clothes to school later that morning.  But in that moment he didn't care - puddles were meant to be stomped in.  He was going to stomp, and stomp, and stomp.  And he was willing to pay the price. Every girl in my class arrived totally dry.  :-)That is the strongest memory of my 4 years of teaching second grade. As a new teacher I wondered ... how much of this difference between boys and girls is due to nurture rather than nature.  Now I strongly believe nurture is the stronger influence in how individuals approach all things in their environment.  And now I am going to have a grand daughter.  The stakes seem so much higher for her today than that day I watched Terrence make an educated decision and taking a free action.   Nurture.  That is what it is all about.We are totally thrilled as a family for this cherished little girl.  My first words to my son on learning the sex of his child was what I wanted for her.  I want his daughter to be raised as a self confident, strong, intelligent, and fearless individual.  We need more women in the world who aren't limited by their gender.  I believe the time is ripe for raising these kind of female children ... especially in light of the current movement of women on the public stage!!  And he agrees!  My son is a black belt in martial arts, he is creative, self taught, self confident, not worried about wearing pink (another story for another time, ha!) and he picked a spouse who espouses exactly the kind of woman we should have more of in our world.  He plans on raising his daughter in the style that will make her all of the  things I want her to be!  My son and his wife are perfect for raising a girl.I am so proud of the son I raised.  My daughter as well ... she is no slouch either.  She agrees with us completely, but sees things through a slightly different lens ... \"yes, mom, she can grow up to be ALL those things, while wearing pearls and lipstick.\"  I guess as a family we have all the bases covered!!:-)I think of Terrance now and then.  He would be about 54 years old today.  He is forever frozen in my mind as that wonderfully free and inquisitive child - all in yellow.  He, of course, will never know the influence he has had over my hopes for my grand daughter today.  Dear grand daughter, find the same the same joy, freedom and adventure in life as Terrance ... starting with the puddles!"},

Lesson to be learned from this story ... never pay any attention to anything I say!  :-)This final gift is long overdue.  It is a shawl for the new mom.  I have had this idea for some time that new mothers-to-be should have a personal gift just for them.  After all, anyone who has been pregnant knows that pregnancy isn't always easy.  Nausea, expanding waist line, frequent trips to the bathroom at night, someone punching at you from the inside, odd cravings, crazy hormones ... really, this list is the tip of a slippery iceberg!  It can be the most wonderful time of your life - or the worst - and even a mix of both.  A gift for the person who is sharing their body with another human being is the least I could do.My daughter-in-law is of Italian descent, with dark hair, dark eyes and a lovely olive complexion.  This red color is perfect for her.Since the shower my knitting list of projects has grown very large.  No more newborn - for sure.  Working on an 18 month red hoodie for my grand daughter now.  And there are two knitted dragons I want to make (more on the dragon theme in another post.).  Several shawls are in my line up for my daughter, daughter-in-law and myself AND a matching poncho outfit for mother and daughter - the pattern is so darn cute.   My sister's daughter had her first baby this past August - and yes, I did some knitting for my grand nephew, Will (pictures to follow.). And there is a very handsome cabled sweater in my radar for him in Christmas 2018. So I will be busy.  Very very busy! So much to look forward to!!"},
{"title": "A Baby Shower", "date": "Tuesday, December 12, 2017", "text": "Although I have avoided repeating it over and over and over ..... and over again on my blog, it probably needs to be said now as I begin this blog post.  I am going to be a grandmother in February. Ok, more emphasis - I AM GOING TO BE A GRANDMOTHER!!Oh, heck, one more time with feeling  I AM GOING TO BE A GRANDMOTHER!!!Hopefully you get the picture ... a mother (me) who has looked forward to being a grandmother for probably 20 years and just when she accepted the obvious - no grandchildren for her (me) - a grand child was conceived.  It is like winning the billion dollar lottery - hard to wrap my brain around it.This little life is most precious to me.  Sort of a perfect jewel in the crown of my life.  Earlier this month we held a baby shower for my daughter-in-law.  It has been probably 40 years since I attended a baby shower.  They haven't changed much.  Food, laughter and gifts.  At the new mom's request, we skipped the games.  But we did have a few fun activities.Time Capsule StationI was in charge of the Time Capsule activity.  Guests were invited to write a note to the new baby.  Notes can include best wishes for a full life, predictions of how the baby's life will evolve, stories about the baby's family members, advice, etc.  The notes are put in a 'time capsule' to be opened and read by the child on her 18th birthday.  We are taking this activity one step further.  Instead of limiting notes to just those who attended the shower, the 'time capsule' can be added to over the years with notes by friends and family.The sign explaining the 'time capsule' project.Periodically throughout the event I noticed people sitting at the table, writing their notes and using the sealing wax I included to seal the envelope.The mirrored box for putting the notes in - which will be  replaced by a sealed box with a slot on top that her dad, my son, will make.I enjoyed the search which resulted in this beautiful mirrored box.  It will be replaced by something that can be sealed.  But this lovely box can be used by my beautiful little grand daughter to hold any special items she desires.The first two letters - one from my daughter and one from me.I am also very grateful for an opportunity to share through letters my love and bits of my life with my grand daughter as she grows.  I hope I live long enough to see her grow into a young woman, but life makes no guarantees.  So having a voice through writing to share with her as a young adult is very important to me.As with most parties there was food.  Lots and lots of food.  Too much really.  We had about 20 guests and could have fed 50!  No one left hungry.Another activity was decorating Onesies.  Guests used their own originality to put messages on these tiny garments.  Then they were hung on a clothes line for all to see.  Great fun!Guess who did this one!!  :-)It was a wonderful time for all. Next up ... the gifts grandma (me) brought to the shower.  Yes, they were handmade."},
{"title": "My Happy Place", "date": "Wednesday, November 29, 2017", "text": "This is a beaded shawl I finished for my daughter as a gift for this Christmas.  I don't think she follows my blog so this picture should be safe here.  The pattern is called Cathedral Windows.And she lives directly across the street from the National Cathedralwith beautiful cathedral windows.   I began knitting officially in 1998.  I say 'officially' because I sort of knew how to knit back in the 70's, but the hobby never took root then.  I was self taught.  I was terrible at it.  I wanted immediate gradification.  I had no patience for long projects, problem solving fit issues, learning to correct mistakes, or accepting the fact an item might 'perfect' even if I was the only who could see the error.  In 1998, however, I left a life sucking management job and had learned that imperfection was ok.  I decided to 'recover' from that profession by learning to knit at a yarn store. The time was right.  Knitting became a life-enhancing hobby that I would be lost without.Over the years I tried to expand my crafting horizon beyond knitting to other related activities. Some Merino and Silk fiber that is waiting for me tospin it.I learned to spin.  There was, of course, the initial excitement and purchasing of equipment.   First I spun yarn on a spindle and then quickly bought a full size spinning wheel.  I looked at the end product of spinning - yarn.  I realized pretty quickly that I am a product spinner rather than a process spinner.  I wanted the finished yarn (the product) more than the effort (the process) to get the yarn.  The yarn I created was nice, interesting, unique.  But I have no desire to create one-of-a-kind yarns.  I am happy to purchase beautiful yarns - owning it NOW - rather than participating in the dream of owning it someday.  I gave my spinning wheel to a cousin.  I kept my spindles and sometimes they 'call' to me.  I will return to this hobby at some point - casually dipping my toe back in the water of spindle spinning - because I have some wonderful fibers that I just can't part with.  But can spinning ever replace knitting?  Never.Here is a woven shawl I treasure.  It was created by my cousinusing hand spun yarn.  The amount of effort for a shawl likethis is enormous.I learned to weave.  Again, my initial interest in weaving sparked excitement ... and new equipment, new skills, new jargon.  I had active weavers in my family.  My Pennsylvania cousin is an amazing weaver with several floor looms and a wide variety of table looms.  My sister was bitten by the weaving bug and is in hot pursuit in the 'loom acquisition contest' she has going with our cousin.  And it is great fun to watch them.  They both create beautiful items.    And I own three table style looms, a tapestry loom and several pin looms.  I plan to keep all those - especially the smaller looms.  I can see myself weaving projects on my pin looms at some point, as well as the tapestry loom.  And maybe I will return to my table looms.   Maybe.  But I am a product weaver - wanting the end item more than wanting the process of weaving.  Although this hobby did make more inroad in my crafting time and wallet, did it tramp down my enthusiasm for knitting?  No.  Not even a close second.  Too much equipment to juggle for me.  Not as portable as knitting, and while the product produced can be breath taking when finished, it requires a pretty decent commitment of time to learn the craft at that level.  Desire must be present.  I think I am missing the desire.And then there is knitting, the craft that started it all.  Knitting never left my side during my side trips into other crafts.  After 20 years of knitting, I can accomplish most projects at an acceptable level even to my critical perfectionist eye.  Yes, knitting takes more time than weaving or spinning.  It is an argument I have heard more than once.  Since I am a process knitter rather than a product knitter, time is not a negative.   And knitting is so much more portable than the other two crafts: simple tools can be carried anywhere.  Finally ... the most important positive element of knitting that trumps all other craft considerations - is the calming effect it has on my brain.  No need for drugs.  Knitting is sort of my happy place.  The missing element in spinning and weaving - desire - is abundant in knitting for me.  But it should be said ... finding your calm place can happen with any craft.  Weavers and spinners say it all the time - how relaxing their craft is ... and I believe it because I experience it with knitting.Here is a shawl I made for myselfto wear to a wedding.   Another shawl I made for myself.I love that knitting graduated from the 'rocking chair grandmother' status into an activity that is loved by all ages.  In fact, weaving and spinning has also experienced a resurgence in popularity.  It could be argued that this resurgence is because of knitting.Knitting, it seems, is the 'gateway drug' to many fiber activities like weaving and spinning for a lot of people.If you don't knit and are considering learning this habit forming activity, don't say I didn't warn you!"},
{"title": "Milo's sweater", "date": "Tuesday, November 28, 2017", "text": "I haven't done a good job of documenting my finished knitted projects.  Years ago I took pictures and then posted them on a knitter's website called Ravelry.  But I didn't keep that up for long. This fall, however, I finished a bunch of stuff that I am pretty pleased about.  (It is amazing just how much you can get done when you are laid up with a lame leg from surgery.)  I thought I might show them off on my blog.The earliest finished project was Milo's Sweater.  That was finished in September.When he was a much younger dog, I made this exact same pattern in the same yarn but in green.  He wore that sweater a long time.  After years of faithful service, the sweater turtle neck began to fray.  I stitched it up.  But the repairs started to fray.  There was no doubt, this old guy needed a new sweater. from his grandmother.I used a yummy Merino yarn called Water Lilly from Classic Elite that is no longer being produced.  It is closer to an aran weight yarn than a worsted weight.  It is soft and softens more with use - and it is the kind of wool you can wear close to your skin.  It is also a kettle dyed yarn - with very subtle changes in hue.  Some kettle dyes are so striking that they compete for attention with patterned knit stitches.  Water Lilly kettle dyes are soft and add depth to a piece without competing with knit stitches like the cabling in Milo's sweater.   It is my favorite yarn ever so far and I wish they were still making it. I have a rather large collection of Water Lilly - because I bought sweater lots when I realized it was discontinued.  So did my sister.  Since that purchase years ago, my sister has become more of a weaver - and I have become less of a weaver.  We did a trade last spring.  I gave her a bunch of my weaving yarns, and she gave me all of her Water Lilly!  Score!!  In the trade I duplicated many colors I had (which was great), and I got a few new colors like this cream (which was greater.)Finding the exact pattern I used about 5 years ago was a struggle, but thankfully I throw very little away when it comes to knitting.  This second sweater actually fits Milo better than the first one.  I had Milo with me for a full week in September - so while I was knitting I could make frequent size checks adjusting the pattern as needed.  I could also create a slot on the back where his leash connects to his harness - in exactly the right spot. You can see the slot just below the turtle neck on his back.I love it when a project comes together perfectly.  The perfect yarn, the perfect color, the perfect pattern and the perfect size."},
{"title": "All Decked Out ", "date": "Monday, November 27, 2017", "text": "A quick peak around the Christmas decorations in place for this year.It starts with the Christmas Tree.  It always starts with the tree.  This artificial tree is about 2 years old.  It  is a smaller slim line tree that works good in small spaces.  It is pre-lite and simple construction.  It holds about 1/2 the ornaments I have.  My goal:  some time in the next two years get a table top model tree.  My perfect three would be a about 3-4 feet high that would sit on a table by the window.  It would be on a stand that maybe plays music and rotates.  Pre-lite would be good.  I keep looking and nothing seems to be just right - so until it is - this tree will be part of my Christmas.The tree decorations are all meaningful.  The little gold house in the picture below is the a miniature replica of the old time train station located in historic Ellicott City.  About two years ago Ellicott City was assaulted by a major flash flood - devastating the small town and killing one person.  Having withstood many floods in the past, many historic, the town has come back.  The gold tree ornament is a way to support the rebuilding.The Pug Cookie Jar holds my grand dogs' cookies.  My dear grand dog Grimace, a pug with a heart of gold, has long since passed away.  I miss him every day.  But he is mentioned when I give out cookies to the grand dogs who replaced him.  \"Who wants one of Grimace's cookies?  Only good dogs get one of his cookies.\"The small lighted Christmas Tree beside the cookie jar was made by my mom during her 'ceramic painting' phase.  This kind of lighted tree is dated compared to more stylish decorating options available today.  But this little tree will always be a part of my Christmas.  It reminds me of her every time I look at it.  And I miss her every day as well.This little collection of lighted houses belonged to my mother-in-law.  It has been some time since I had them out for the holiday, but this year I wanted her represented in our celebration.The other side of the lighted house display as it faces the kitchen.  This pug ornament, a gift from my daughter, demonstrations so truthfully the fun loving nature of Pugs.  My daughter and her fearless companion, Milo, (in the tan sweater that I made for him this season), helped with the holidays lights on the deck.  Our tree is a mix of dog and cat ornaments. The two dog ornaments below show Meathead (left) and Milo (right).Meathead was my first grand dog.  He was such a dear dog.  This final ornament was made by my mom.  She loved crafts.This is another of my mother-in-law's lighted houses.  It sits in a naturally dark corner of the kitchen counter.This final picture shows just two Santas from a large collection of Santas I once owned.  Collections became a thing of the past when we downsized.  But I kept a few of my favorite Santas.When the kids were young, I used to decorate the whole first floor of the townhouse.  All the rooms. Regular knick knacks got packed away and everything was Christmas themed.  That was a major chore.  The decorations filled many many boxes when stored during the year and filled an entire large basement closet.  And my efforts were modest compared to some people I have known.  My neighbor below me pays for storage for her Christmas decorations.  I am sure she is not the only one who does this.When the thrilling rush of the season began to fade during my mom's care years,  Christmas decorating faded too.  My heart wasn't in it.  Many of those items were finally downsized out of the house - holding onto only those items that had real meaning.   I could never to back to the Holiday Wonderland-style of decorating I once aimed for.  Now I am content with much less.  And because there is less, I appreciate each item that survived the purge so much more.So how do you celebrate the season ... if you do celebrate!"},
{"title": "Anticipating the Christmas Season", "date": "Sunday, November 26, 2017", "text": "For anyone who is paying attention to the 'rules' (ok, my rules), it is now officially ok to decorate for Christmas. We are passed Halloween and Thanksgiving.   I have to say it.   No rushing the holidays, folks.   To me that means prior to this weekend - NO Christmas stuff in the stores, no Christmas music on my favorite radio station, no Christmas themed TV commercials, and no decorating anything until after the turkey left overs are history!  And yet, the exact opposite happens every year. Obviously I need to get these rules published somewhere!!This year was especially frustrating.  My favorite radio station began playing 24/7 Christmas music 2 weeks before Thanksgiving.  Really, folks.  Is anyone really going to want to listen to Christmas music for 6 weeks??  Isn't that a method of torture somewhere in the world?  I have switched stations.Several years ago I made several changes to our holiday rituals.  I stopped sending greeting cards and yearly newsletters.  Lordy that took a lot of time.  I stopped making dozens and dozens of Christmas cookies.  I had enough inches on my hips.  I stopped decorating the house like a Trim-a-Tree shop!  Two years ago I downsized all my Christmas decorations.  Moving was in our sights and some items hadn't been displayed in years.  Those changes made a BIG difference in the quality of my life around this time of year. I kept a few traditions - Family Christmas Evening celebration with dinner and gift giving is the center piece of my holiday.  The family sleeps over and stays for Christmas morning breakfast.  I still decorate a tree but I may downsize the size of the tree in a year or two.  This year I added back in a few more house decorations - just a few - and for the first time ever, my daughter and I put lights up outside.  My deck is now festive.  Nothing fancy, but fun to look at.  And we host a Christmas party for friends the weekend after New Years. I still struggle with the fact both my parents died within 3 days of Christmas.  The holiday lost a lot luster for me when mom went into Assisted Living - also in December - and was not able to come home for any holidays due to her disabilities.  But it has been 3 years since she died - 3 years on December 28 - and while I still miss her especially during the holidays - the intensity of that sorrow fades with time. She suffered too much to wish her back.My decorating is finished.  My shopping is about three quarters finished.  And I will begin wrapping gifts in a week or two.  Meal planning for special events will follow.  I might even catch a few Christmas specials on TV.  On that schedule I can enjoy the holiday and find time to think on the real reason for the season.Next up ... a few pictures of our decorations - followed by a few pictures of my finished knitted projects."},
{"title": "Be A Tortorise", "date": "Monday, November 20, 2017", "text": "I have one basic rule!  If it doesn't work ... cut it out!I used that rule with my tonsils, and with my gallbladder, and with the cloudy lenses in my eyes.  Yep!  If you aren't pulling your weight in my body, you must go.The problem with rules is there are always exceptions.  Always!My knee is one of those exceptions, I guess.I am still in PT.  Still.  The knee continues to improve ... slowly.  Ever so slowly.  My left knee has good days and bad days.  Bad days are shrinking in frequency ...  sort of.  And (I guess) Medicare wouldn't continue to pay for the therapy if I didn't need it!  So the glass is half full ... I guess.Today I had a therapy session.  The therapist did a mini update in advance of my next Ortho.  She said the flexion in my left knee (the knee with the surgery) was within normal limits.  Sounded pretty good until she said the flexion in my right knee was amazing for a person of my age.   All I could think of was ... both knees were once amazing! Ok, ok, ok.  Keep icing the knee, because I still am struggling with some swelling, keep exercising because my leg muscles are still not really strong, and stop comparing my left knee with my right knee ... 'cause comparing 'siblings knees' never comes to any good.This evening I received a wonderful piece of advice from a cousin in an email.  \"Be a tortoise.\"  Thank you, Susan.  Sometimes the obvious just needs to be said."},
{"title": "Healing", "date": "Monday, October 23, 2017", "text": "I have never been one to be patient with my own illnesses.  I guess that is a result of having pretty decent general health.  If you don't have a lot of things to recover from (or live with chronically) you never learn the art of personal patience in healing.My earliest memory of facing a serious illness was a breast lump I found 6 months after the birth of my first child.  I was 26 years old.  I remember looking in the bathroom mirror into the eyes of the new mother I was standing there and thinking ... This . Can . Not . Be!!   A visit to the doctor confirmed my deepest desire - you are so young, chances of this being cancer are slim, we will do a needle biopsy just to confirm that fact, nothing to worry about.  Driving home after that appointment I remember thinking ... he said the word 'cancer.'  I was stoic.  I was in control.  To the casual eye - that day looked no different than any other.  But I really didn't hear anything else he said. I just heard the word 'cancer.'  That night I crumbled under the possibilities as I told my husband.  As I reached the word cancer, I started to cry.The needle biopsy was not definitive. I was scheduled for a lumpectomy.  I was admitted to the hospital - appearing calm and resolute.  The night before surgery I had to sign away my breast - consent to removal of all breast tissue and lymph nodes if cancer was confirmed - that step would be taken while I was still under general anesthesia (remember, this was 1974 when your options were limited.). The pre-op nurse arrived right before lights out and she asked me how I felt about the possibility of losing a breast.  In that split second my mantra of life erupted from me without a second thought:  \"If it is cancer they can take the whole right side of my body - just as long as they get it all.  I have a son to raise.\"It wasn't cancer.  I have never faced the possibility of a fatal illness since.  Oh, yes, I had a c-sections, gallbladder removed, tonsils removed at 30, and I had early onset cataracts in my 40s.  Thankfully I was born during a time when these things didn't result in death or disability.  And none of them made me feel fearful of dying or resulted in extended healing.  I have been blessed.But I still remember that terrible feeling of wondering in the hospital the night before - maybe I won't recover if this is cancer!Now at 70 I recognize that my future years may be filled with more physical ailments or illnesses that cannot be fixed or cured.  I can't use my default response to failing body parts -  \"If you don't work properly - I will just have you cut out.\"  Ha!  That method worked quite well for a gallbladder and tonsils. And so we come to the healing of my left knee - the reason I have told this story.  It goes without saying that if my knee wasn't fix-able - I wouldn't be able to just cut it out.  So I patiently did all the right stuff - doctor visits, tests, physical therapy - and STILL it didn't improve to normal.  A cane became my companion.  My former Tai Chi instructor calls walking with a cane - walking on 3 legs.  Nope!  That was not for me.  Surgery was the next step.And surgery confirm my problem was very fixable AND that I had young knees and connective tissues for someone who is 70. OK ... now we are talk'en!! Expectations rose to nose bleed heights!!Now for the healing (and the patience) part of the story  I am now 6 weeks out from surgery.  I am ready to be done with the healing part.  I want to go out and do my regular stuff without pain.   I gave it 6 weeks.  This left knee should be as strong and flexible as my right knee by now.  I am DONE DONE DONE with this!  In fact, I find myself having occasional conversations with my left knee (don't judge ... ) that go something like:  \"Get over yourself left knee.  Six whole weeks, for gosh sakes!!  You need to get stop with the complaining.  Just go ask the gallbladder and tonsils how I dealt with them. Oh wait, left knee ... you might notice they are both GONE!  Ha!  So stop the swelling.  Stop popping.  Stop aching.  Stop, stop, stop.\"  And then I share my frustration with my physical therapist - and she calmly and quietly reminds me - \"Elaine it is only 6 weeks from surgery.  Be patient.\"  oh ...See??  I have learned nothing about patience in healing over 70 years.  Nothing!!But I did learn a very important lesson when I was 26!  I won't die from this knee problem!  I will live to see and enjoy a new grandchild.   So I guess the most important lesson has been learned after all.  And knowing me - I am only good at one lesson in a lifetime! :-)Healing just tests my patience.  I can live with that."},
{"title": "The RBG Workout", "date": "Thursday, October 19, 2017", "text": "A new book hit the Amazon shelves this week - one that caught my eye over the summer while I was wallowing in self pity about my stupid knee.  I pre-ordered it and it showed up in my mail box yesterday.The RBG Workout by Bryant JohnsonFor readers who don't know who RBG is - she is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a US Supreme Court Justice.  She is 84 years old and a much admired woman in our country. This very charming book was written by her personal trainer.  It is small but very inspiring.  The back cover says it all:How does Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the Supreme Court's favorite octogenarians, stay so active and energetic?  She owes it in part to the twice-weekly workouts she does with her personal trainer, Bryant Johnson, a man she's called \"the most important person\" in her life (after her family, of course).  Now, with The RBG Workout, you can exercise alongside Justice Ginsburg and Bryant.  Whether you want to keep up with one of America's most admired women or just reach your own fitness goals, this book is for you.  Case closed.The book holds no surprises or short cuts - many of the recommended exercises are ones recommended by my physical therapist.  And the exercises are graduated in difficulty as you would expect allowing reasonable start.  They are designed to fit within an hour.  It all seems like typical common sense stuff - stuff that you have heard before.But stop for one moment and think about these facts ...She is 84 years old!  I have known a number of folks in their 80s - and they aren't able to do even 25% of the simple exercises in this book.  After nursing a knee since May, I can't do most of them either!!  She is 84 - I am 70!  hmm ...  That fact alone makes my head spin.This woman can do full push ups AND planks!!  Even SIDE PLANKS.  I bow to that achievement.She wears a sweat shirt when she exercises that says \"Super Diva!\"  How can you not love some one their 80s - mid 80s!!! -  who struts a sweat shirt like that! If you think she has exercised all her life - you are wrong!  She began this program slowly in her 60s - after surviving a bout of colorectal cancer.  After surgery, chemotherapy and radiation her husband described her as looking like \"Auschwitz survivor.\"  And now, folks, she can DO PLANKS!  The illustrations are all drawn.  The exercises are well described with suggestions for frequency and repetition.  She is proof positive that there is no bad time for taking control of your own life and making a difference.I hope you will check out the small but powerful little volume that is dedicated to not giving up on yourself no matter what your age or condition. (Of course, checking with your physician is recommended before starting an new exercise program.)These last 6 months have been frustrating for me ... limited by a lame leg despite weeks of PT and still walking with a cane.  And the journey to regaining 2 normal legs is not quite finished.  At 70 it doesn't take too many months of inactivity to reduce you to a person older than your biological age.  I feel that way everyday now.  But the words of her trainer in the Introduction rang out very true for me.  \"You may have an appointment to the most powerful job in the world, but your body will still have veto power over you.  And you're the only one with jurisdiction over your body, so if you don't use it, you will lose it.\"Thinking of putting that quote on my fridge!One last observation - I received 2 copies of this book.  This was not intentional - I think my brain experienced a hiccup!  *sigh*  So many parts of my body need attention! :-) Happy Thursday all!"},
{"title": "Hello Again", "date": "Tuesday, October 17, 2017", "text": "Without trying to sound trite, time just seems to fly past me.October!  It is actually the middle of October!!It feels like last week when I last wrote.  I opened the blog to find it was June!It is about this time when I start thinking about how well the current year has gone.  And certainly the last 4 months have had ups and downs.The stellar highlight of 2017 has to be the announcement that I will become a grandmother sometime in February 2018.  I sort of gave up entirely on that idea, as my 'children' lead successful happy lives with no indication of having children of their own.  Giving birth to a child is a very personal choice and the choice to not reproduce must be respected.  But I did hope one day have a grandchild of my own.  And that hope could only be made reality by one of my own children.A less stellar event was my left knee.  One day in May I awoke to pain and swelling in that joint.  I got medical help, participated in 8 weeks of physical therapy only to discover that what I had was a torn meniscus and it would only be fixed by surgery.  Surgery in September followed by more PT through October brought me to this day - the knee is improved but still not as flexible or as strong as it needs to be.  I am forced to learn patience - my therapist reminds me frequently that healing a knee takes time because it is a joint that doesn't get much down time.The condo was a great blessing to me during this last 6 months.  No stairs and a smaller home 'foot print' to maintain proved to be worth all the effort expended in 2016 to get there.  It took a full year but I have finally move away from thinking of my much loved townhouse as my home.  Now when I think about it, those 30 years and that townhouse seem just like a different stage of my life that I have moved past.  Which, in truth, it truly is. I am eager to return to a more active life style after so much sedentary living since May.  A return to regular walking is eagerly desired.  And when I don't need to favor the healing in my knee, that exercise will be on my daily schedule.  I did drop The Y - membership.  I am very fortunate to live not too far from a fully equipped senior center that has a full exercise studio as well as a pool.  Of course, it also offers a huge range of other activities as well (book clubs, lectures, lunch service, located near a beautiful library with all their own offerings, etc.) All that for the cost of $75 a year vs $600 a year at The Y.  Hard to argue with those figures.And my knitting life has been very very full.  I finished a shawl for my daughter, a shawl for my daughter-in-law, a sweater for my niece's new baby, and a baby blanket for my new granddaughter.  In the next month I need to finish a sweater for my granddaughter and a matching set of father-daughter hats in the Viking theme (a suggestion from the new dad.)  Yes, I have had a lot of forced sitting time.  The only thing that got a work out since May were my fingers.  Pictures of these project will follow.After long breaks in blogging, I often wonder if anyone will return to read anything I write.  But if I really wrote for an audience, I would have stopped writing long ago.  Writing is something I do for me.  But if you did stop by and you read all the way to this point, I would be happy to hear from you.Happy Fall Everyone!!"},

(I'll probably regret this decision.  Ha!)Question 004#004Ignoring all financial considerations, would you ratherspend the next 5 years confined to an urban mecca like New York City,ora beautiful, isolated town on the California coast?Ahhhh!    Finally.  A simple question for me.No equivocation.  No expanded explanations in an effort to make my final answer more acceptable - in my eyes, at least.  If you are confused by what I am saying ... check out the previous posting when I attempted to answer question #003.  (Gosh, that was a hard one but it did spark a few good comments.  Thank you to those who responded.)So here is my answer to #004. I choose, hands down, \"a beautiful, isolated town on the California coast.\"   I love the peace and quiet of town life - \"beautiful\" town would be an added benefit.  And \"on the coast\" would make it heaven for me.  I don't get much \"coast\" time now.  And \"isolation\" is a HUGE plus for me.  I often prefer my own company to that of others.  No negatives.  Easy-peasy.  End of discussion.(little voice rising to the surface)But I am 70 now.  What about health care, what about access to a good quality hospital, what about the ability to seek out social stimulation when I want it, what about .... what about .... what about ....   Isn't the word \"isolated\" the limiting factor?  I could be within a few years of not driving.  Then what?  How much public transportation does this \"isolated town\" have?  I bet not much.  And my family and friends ... where are they?  I live in Maryland now.  They live in Maryland now.  The question only offered California, not isolated small towns like in California.    Yikes!!!  What about my grand dogs - how would I see them???   You can't scratch a Skype dog image behind their ears! Shouldn't I provide a more responsible grown up answer that shows I recognize my current life needs and limitations?Crap!  This was supposed to be an easy answer.Think, think, think.Ok - this still is my answer.  It is only for 5 years.  I would only be 75 at the end of that time - a 'spring chicken' really.'  :-)   My children could visit me - drive across the country with their dogs!!   Monthly!!!  Ok, maybe not monthly - quarterly would do.  They would do that if they REALLY loved me.  And all those \"what abouts\" are important - can be very important at times.  But when I try to picture myself living in an \"urban mecca like New York City\" ... No.  Never.  I am not a city girl in the slightest.  I wouldn't live another 5 years even with quality health care if I had to live in any big city!  I would HATE it.My decision for  \"beautiful, isolated town on the California coast\" still stands!*Sigh*Aren't there ANY easy questions in this book???Glad I don't have to really make this choice!Just for the record ... I have peaked ahead at question #005.  It looks like an easy answer!   Famous last words. :-)If I can silence that (little voice rising to the surface) with a hammer, (jump up and down on it a few hundred times) ... (shoot it from head to foot with a machine gun and bury 1000 feet down) ...  (cover it with gasoline and then light a match) ... THEN it might be easy.  Which would be your favorite place to spend the next 5 years.  I would really like to know."},
{"title": "The Island", "date": "Sunday, June 25, 2017", "text": "As most of you know, I am a knitter.  Knitting is my passion. Last year I saw the cutest crochet pattern called The Island Playset.  I fell in love with it.  The design was charming because around the far edge of the ocean is threaded a ribbon that can be pulled together to contain all the little animals and the island into a self contained bag.But it was crochet and I didn't have any children in my life to make it for.  And I hadn't done crochet in such a long long time.  And I didn't know where my crochet hooks were and I didn't have the right yarn - and on and on!  So I saved the pattern - but never forgot about it.Then it happened.  This year my niece is pregnant and I whipped out that pattern again. The self talk began.      Me 1 - \"Hmmm, I could make this.\"     Me 2 - \"Nooo, it is crochet.\"     Me 1 - \"But you saved this pattern for a year.\"     Me 2 - \"I know, but ... \"     Me 1 - \"Oh for heavens sake - get a grip!  You want to make this pattern.\"     Me 2 - \"Well .... maybe just a little bit.\"     Me 3 - (Yes, I have a split personality.) \"Me 1 and Me 2!!!  Shut up!  Both of you go find the                 crochet hooks and get hooking.\"  Or whatever they call it.My goal was to finish it in time for the baby shower which happened last weekend - which I did.  Sadly I had to  miss that joyful event, because that was also the day my Max died.  My daughter delivered the Island Play set on my behalf - with 3 little summer outfits (for next year), a dapper  little man sun hat, sun glasses, a fishing pole and magnetic fish,  and some plastic sea creature that squirt bath water - all in a white basket.The picture above was taken by my sister who reported the Island Playset was a big hit.  I meant to take my own pictures - but picture taking was the last thing on my mind that weekend.  Thankfully I do have a picture to share however. And now I can tuck away Me 1, 2, and 3 until the next time I dither about something."},
{"title": "The Book of Questions - #003", "date": "Saturday, June 24, 2017", "text": "Series: The Book of Questions by Gregory Stork, Ph.dQuestion 003#003If you had to be obsessed with money, sex, sports, religion, or food,which one would you choose?You know, I look at these questions and I almost always think, \"Oh this question isn't too hard.\"  And then I try to answer and I realize - not so easy!I spent a few minutes trying to pick one I would be happily obsessed with.  My eyes kept scanning the short list discarding one after another looking for ... I am not sure what!  AMAZINGLY - knitting wasn't on this list. Go figure!  :-)Since once again I seem to struggle for an answer, we will start with the ones I wouldn't pick.Sports - Last PlaceThe only time I am only remotely interested in sports is during the Olympics and when the home team is playing in some sort of final competition - like King of the Sports World.  Nope, not sports!Sex - Very Near Last PlaceHoly cow, when I think of someone who is 'obsessed with sex,' I think of someone who has a mental illness.  No, and why would anyone choose to be obsessed with an illness.Religion - In the middle of the pack (remember, this is my personal position and the question asked for total honesty.)Religion placed low on my list because they included the word 'obsessed' in the question.  Really ... being obsessed with religion has gotten the world into more trouble than any other thing.  History is littered with folks who were obsessed with religion and caused great havoc and sadness to the human race.  I truly believe that even God doesn't want man to be obsessed with Religion - especially organized religion - ANY organized religion.  I think God is obsessed with people living a good life - no matter what your religion.  Doesn't sound hard, does it.  Only humans make things so darn hard.You might ask ...with that opinion why isn't Religion in last place.  For me religion implies an organized way of thinking about the Creator - a way to structure the unknowable.  Not a bad thing.  Raised Catholic my belief structure leans that way.  But I have grown to be more spiritual than traditionally Catholic. I don't support 'the one true faith' theory.  If there is a heaven, it will be filled with all who have lived a good life.  Yes, I check the Catholic box when asked for my religious preference (it is what I know best), I occasionally find comfort in entering a church (an empty church is best) but I can get that same feeling by walking in a forest, and I firmly believe there is a God and that thought gives me comfort especially for all the family and pets who have passed from my life.  I want to experience them again in whatever passes for an after life.  But does that count as obsessed with religion?  God help me - that would be my idea of a nightmare.FoodWell ... I hate to cook.  And the question didn't say anything about eating food.  I love to eat.  Really, 'food' is pretty vague.  I suppose a chef could be described as 'obsessed with food.'  But it might be argued that a chef is obsessed with the process of food preparation and presentation.  They probably enjoy eating their creations, but obsessed with eating food?  No, it must be the act of cooking.Regardless - food keeps me alive.  But it can't be in the top spot. Money - the winner by process of eliminationBoy, having Money in the top spot sounds so ... so ... shallow!Why couldn't they have included knitting!!!  :-)This choice, money, is the one I am most comfortable.  Obsession with money sounds harsh but when I think about that choice - I also think about what money can provide.  Beyond the basics of a comfortable life for myself, money can make a huge difference to family and friends, charities and scientific research, education and third world countries.  The list is endless.So 'money' wins.  (Hopefully spending it wisely redeems me.)I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to hear your choice and why you picked it."},

We would do that. ANYTHING!! And they trained us in the technique.And so began the journey of nursing a 3 year old cat with a bad diagnosis for years and years. When he died, 5 days ago, he was 11 years old!  ELEVEN YEARS!  No one would have guessed that a \"few years\" would extend to 8 years. In March he began to lose weight.  The vet confirmed his kidney lab values were dropping.  His appetite had dropped off dramatically.  We continued the fluids every other night, and then every night at half dose to even out his hydration.  We scoured the stores for foods that would tempt him to eat.  We fed him several times a day.  We carefully monitored him for quality of life issues.  We enjoyed every moment because we knew the moments were rapidly disappearing.He tried and he tried and he tried.  But by the time we reached June, we knew we were losing the battle.  The time had come to make that terribly tough decision - the one where you put the needs of your pet ahead of your own desires.

{"title": "My Dad", "date": "Sunday, June 18, 2017", "text": "I rarely write about my dad - and that is for a lot of reasons.  He died at 54 years of age in 1970.  The picture was taken on my wedding day in 1969.  On this Father's Day I want to honor him as well as share a bit of our troubled history together.My memories are all colored by a father who was two people to his family.The sober dad was the man my mom fell in love with.  He was kind and loving.  Pictures show a good looking man and one old movie of him reflected an appealing charm.  Not well educated having left school after the 9th grade, he had other gifts that made up for his educational short fall.  He was a hard worker.  I remember him occasionally telling me that my mom was beautiful.  My mom was a beautiful woman.  I think he loved her until the day he died.But that love could not overcome his alcoholism.  Alcoholic dad was a nasty drunk.  Alcochol released a hidden anger and frustration.  Those emotions were vented at his family.  I never knew what caused those unhappy emotions but I suspect they came from his own troubled childhood.  As a child and young woman I never understood why my mom stayed married to my dad.  But at his death I got a glimpse of one of those reasons - she worried that he didn't know how much she loved him.  Love can be a powerful motivator.Now that I am 70 - time and distance from my troubled upbringing have softened the hurtful edges of my relationship with my father.  I understand better how he struggled with an illness - one that consumed him and eventually contributed to his death.  The memories of his hurtful behavior towards his wife and children have faded somewhat and the love has emerged - and understanding.The header to my blog has a picture on the right of me at around age 5 with my dad at the shore.  I don't remember this time - we looked happy.  But I do remember my wedding day, when he struggled to stay sober until my 1:00 pm wedding.  That struggle he made for me warms my heart even 48 years later.  I know now it was a kind of gift - the only gift he could give me. He died a year later and never lived to see the birth of his grandchildren.  Sober dad would have been a wonderful grandfather.  And he would have smiled ear to ear at having a grandson.  This August my sister's daughter is having a baby.  A boy.  I hope he is smiling now from heaven at the birth a a great-grand son.Happy Father's Day Dad."},

Life is too short.  There are too many really serious issues to get worked up over in our world today then to waste time on a toy manufacturer who would probably file my complaint in their circular file (trash.)I am curious about your response to this question.  I am betting the responses will be very different based on each person's individual value system."},

Would I be limited to just walking or bikes or horse drawn buggies!   When I picked this condo location I wanted to be sure I could walk to most places - grocery, doctors, donut shop.  Ok, no on the donut shop - although there is one near enough to walk to.  But I can walk to most things.  I guess I could even still ride a bike.  Think, think, think.The right answer for me was there all along ... motorized vehicles would have to go.  I will say, I am really glad I don't have to pick. Now it is your turn if you want to share.  I would love to hear what is the right answer for you!"},

{"title": "When the container drips ", "date": "Sunday, May 28, 2017", "text": "Have you ever had a feeling, a thought that keeps returning ... that seems to grow in size until action spills out?Well, once again, I feel a need is growing. When we moved into this condo all our worldly belongings fit!  Just fit!  I was amazed at the time that I 'guessed' correctly in downsizing from a large townhouse into this condo.  The decision of what would fit in a new abode was like trying to determine exactly which plastic food container to use when storing the chili that half fills your cook pot - and discovering the food container you picked held your chili perfectly - down to the last drop.  When I guess correctly with a food container, I feel like doing a fist bump with someone - except that the available  'someone' usually is my husband who would roll his eyes if I asked him to fist bump over chili in a Tupperware container!  Ha.Now we are settled into the condo and every last drop of our stuff still fits despite increasing some of our things ... but the thought keeps growing that maybe we moved stuff we didn't really need to keep.Yesterday my metaphysical food container - i.e. condo - tipped and dripped - the lid suddenly would not fit!What started the drip?  My yarn. I have a fairly large inventory of yarn.  It has been a 20 year collection in the making.  And I have loved every minute of it.  I moved all of my yarn from the townhouse to the condo.  I got rid of a lot of other things to be sure I had enough room for the yarn.  I don't separate easily from my yarn.One yarn I purchased about 10 years ago.  It is a pretty nice acrylic with a small amount of wool.   I am not generally a fan of acrylic yarn, but these were very nice colors to my taste, machine wash and dry, and good for garments without looking cheap.  I purchased 4 complimentary colors  ... a total of 16 skeins (I don't do anything half way).  I didn't have a project in mind (always the kiss of death for me.)  Anyway, I started several projects with this yarn over the years but nothing stuck.  The yarn lingered in my stash.  The week I started (multiple starts actually) for a child's sweater in this yarn.  The yarn was perfect in weight, gauge and durability.  But no matter how I mixed and matched the colors - I didn't like how it was evolving. The photo doesn't represent the problem well.The brown and yellow sample - well the yellow reminded me of urine against the brown.  I couldn't get passed that.The rust color make the brown strips look green.  Icky green.  How brown could look like green was beyond me. And then the light dawned on me.I began talking to this yarn - why do you look better wound up in the skein than worked up, why does everything I try with you fail, wouldn't you be happier with someone else, why am I keeping you????  It is time to set you free!!! (It is ok for you to roll your eyes now.)  I walked into the guest yarn room and put all 16 skeins of yarn in a bag for a charity donation.  It wasn't in a fit of frustration that I did this.  I was calm and deliberate. And I am ready to see if other yarn that resides with me would be happier owned by someone else.Then I will start the process again to thin out my other belongings until the condo lid fits comfortably once again."},

And by 'talking' I mean yelling. Both knees talk to me and have done so for years.  You know what I mean - popping and clicking and sometimes little pains.  But yelling - that is a very different kind of talk.  I looked up a blog post that I did on my left knee (Yep!  Only the best bloggers do blog posts on their left knee.  Ha!) and it was November 2013.  That was the last time my left knee did any yelling.  I had ignored the yelling for quite sometime in 2013 before I was forced to seek medical help.  And by 'help' I mean switching one problem for another.During the 2013 knee episode I saw my general doc and he sent me to an ortho doc and then I got handed off to physical therapist and eventually the knee pain resolved - after approximately 4 months - and lots and lots of Advil.And by 'resolved' I mean back to only talking ... not yelling.Talking I can live with.  But now my stomach was talking (ok, yelling) at me because Advil is hard on the GI system.  So the saga of the cranky knee continued through a visit to a gastroenterology who did an EGD (tube with a camera down the throat) to take a look around.  It was simple reflux that was caused by the Advil.  So I was put on a high end reflux drug that after about 4 months I stopped because ... wait for it ... it was adding to my leg cramp problem.  (Jeez!!)  It took a few years but just recently I got the reflux manageable with over the counter drugs and life style changes. So now three and half years later - that left knee is yelling at me again.  AGAIN!!!I am not waiting another two months for it to go away before seeking medical help to resolve this issue.And by 'help' and 'resolved' I mean going to a rheumatologist who is better trained to treat possible arthritic conditions and management without the treatment taking out another organ system. So how many of you have problem knees?And what do you do for them?And is it fair that my expiration dates are various body parts are starting to come due??Rant over.  Back to being a rational human being.  (ok, 'rational' is a bit of a stretch 😊.)"},

If you are lucky enough to still have your mom, love, care and appreciate her - not just on this day - but on all days.  Some day in the future, she may not be around.Happy Mother's Day to my readers who are themselves mothers!It is the most rewarding experience of your life!"},
{"title": "The Living Room / dining room / den - Condo Tour", "date": "Monday, May 1, 2017", "text": "A series of posts on my new home.As I go about my day in this new place I call homeI frequently think ...\"I like this (xyz) so much better.\"Maybe I should write about it.\"I held up writing this last post because I was waiting on the instillation of 2 light/fan combos for the dining area and the den.  Since moving into the condo 8 months ago, we have replaced many old and outdated items.  These light/fan combos are the last of those changes to be done this year.  The light fixtures that came with the condo were pretty ugly to my taste - and, more importantly, we wanted ceiling fans so we could reduce our need for air conditioning.  Electric can be expensive. As you enter the condo - the dining area is to the right, living room to the left,and den straight ahead and center.Entering the condo you walk into a small foyer space with a view of the dining room, living room and den.  This open design works well in a condo with reduced square footage.  One space simply flows into another without the barrier of walls. So many condos had less square footage than this condo AND lots of walls. Walls shrink the feel of the space and place limitations on its use.Dining area - kitchen to the left, main entranceto the right just out of sight.A good example of limitations is our dinning room table.  It is a bit large and can be made larger by another 4 feet of extensions.  In the townhouse we always angled the table from one corner of the room to an opposite corner when the extensions were used.  It worked mostly but was tight for guests getting around the table. I always said ... if we could just push the walls out another 18 inches it would be perfect!  Ha!In the condo the dining table fully extended spreads into the adjacent living room space a bit and can be moved around easily by guests.  No need to wish the walls out another 18 inches because there are no walls.The dining room also displays 3 leather game boards we dearly love.  During more affluent years - when we were both working and had good salaries, we frequented craft shows.  These boards were several of the many items we purchased.  And we still love them as much as we did when purchased.  Still loving something after years of ownership is the sign of a good purchase.The living room space is defined mostly by the arrangement of furniture. In the fore ground is the back of a couch that backs up to the den. It has a cover over it - pets, you know!!Our living room chairs are placed fairly close to the TV so my husband has the best chance of seeing the TV.  You can tell which is my chair.  It is to the left, has a hand-spun hand-woven shawl over the back - which my dear cousin made and which is used almost every single winter morning. A hand spun and hand woven shawl that I havenear me or on me all the time!My chair, where I am sitting right now!!My chair is surrounded by yarn - and it is located next to a display cabinet that houses even more yarn and my legos.  My little space.The den has a more defined area because there are more walls but one corner is open with no door.  It makes for a very open feel when entering the condo.  I love love love that there are no sliding glass doors in this condo. After 40+ years of sliding glass doors, I was ready to return to a standard door for the deck.So that concludes the tour of my condo.  We have made a number of changes and adjustments, and as a result, I have become at ease living here.  This condo was the first place in 45 years that wasn't new when we moved in.  That bothered me some.  But it had been maintained for 12 years by people with similar tastes. Now with the changes I made, this space is more mine.  Glad to finally feel like it reflects me - rather than someone else."},
{"title": "Getting there.", "date": "Wednesday, April 26, 2017", "text": "I guess it had to happen sometime ... I am finally settling into this condo. After 8 months, I feel like I am now living in my own space ... not someone else's place.  Oh, we have been settled physically for several months but furniture placement and pictures on the wall do not dictate how one feels about where you live.  The condo may never achieve the level of 'home' for me, but it has gained the status of 'mine.' We upgraded and replaced a number of items to make it more comfortable and functional.  And our life experiences are starting to imprint on the 'condo ether' in a way that makes this more than just a place to warehouse my stuff.Over time I have met a number of wonderful neighbors.  They are all welcoming.   In fact several weeks ago one neighbor was out taking measurements of the dumpster space for an upcoming project and I was out walking my grand dog.  He asked for my assistance holding the tape measure.  I was happy to help.  We got to talking.  One thing let to another, and this month I attended my first board meeting (annual owner meeting) of the community and was voted onto the board of directors.  Yikes!Having served in this capacity previously, I know the frustrations and satisfactions of this position.  This board is friendly, welcoming and totally engaged in making this community a good place to live.   All are original owners (12+ years), and have a wealth of knowledge regarding the community.  I am grateful I was encouraged to run for a position.  I am honored to be elected.All and all I think my personal adjustment is progressing.  I still feel a small sadness when I think for any amount of time on my old neighborhood and townhome.  Guess that will always be so.  But I am growing in a different direction now ... and looking forward.  No more checking my rear view mirror.  That view has changed greatly and is forever just a memory.Next post - last entry of the condo tour!"},

About a month ago he started to lose weight.  A vet visit revealed that his previously stable lab values were starting to fall.  It was a warning alarm for us.  His unusual robust appetite began to fail.  Normally he would eat anything all the time.  Now he eats  infrequently and only small amounts.Two days ago we noticed a total disinterest in eating.  He had gotten more thin.  We thought we had reached the time that all loving and responsible owners reach at some point - help your loved pet out of life peacefully.  We made the appointment for this morning.Late last night he decided to eat a little.  And he was out and about this morning looking for more.  He did not seem in pain.  We cancelled the appointment.  I guess he still has a handful of kidney cells that are working.Tomorrow we may face this same decision, or maybe next week - but today he is sleeping peacefully in my chair and I'll take every single minute we have left.Today is not the day."},
{"title": "Never say never!  The Y.", "date": "Saturday, April 22, 2017", "text": "No matter what the topic ... never say never!This past January I joined a gym!  In the past I firmly believed that I would never ever get involved in a gym membership.  The reasons are many:  dislike contracts, no interest in body building,  can't stand the gym culture that glamorizes the perfect body, not sure I would stay committed.  Nope! Not for me.And yet ... this year I joined a gym.After the effort of moving had died down, I noticed that my personal strength was dying down too. Condo living definitely takes less effort - 55+ communities are specifically designed to make life  easier.  Great and yet, not great!  'Easier' doesn't keep you strong.  And walking alone was not going to be enough.About 10 minutes from the condo is a new Y.  I was curious.In January I took a tour of this facility!  I found only good things there.  First off, no contracts, just a monthly fee.  Because it was a new year the 'joining fee' was waived.  The offerings were many:  swimming, basketball courts, cycling studios, martial arts classes, flexibility sessions, yoga studios, rock/wall climbing, circuit weight training - something for every interest.  The population, however,  was the biggest draw for me: all ages, abilities, and body types.  Many seniors, people with disabilities, and family groups.  I saw only a few serious body builders.  The rest were regular folks looking to improve health.  I felt totally comfortable.  I joined.My own focus is strength training.  I need to maintain the muscles I have - and maybe build them back to a normal level.  I began with circuit weights - the machines.Easy equipment to use.Thankfully all the cardio equipment has TV.The center provided 4 free sessions with a personal trainer to orient you to the equipment and to set the base line.  They set my base line fairly low at my request.  I needed only one orientation session - the equipment is easy to understand, adjust and use.  I never feel sore afterwards - only tired.The center offers various cardio equipment - treadmills, stationery bikes, recumbent bikes, step climbers, etc.  Although my preference is to walk outside, my neighborhood is not walker friendly.  Having use of this cardio equipment has been helpful.It has been 3 1/2 months since I started this membership and I can feel a difference already.  I have increased my lift weight slowly.  Small but steady progress.  I sometimes struggled with finding the time to go, but I always feel great after the workout.Guess this is a successful start.  Best outcome??  Still doing this in April 2018!"},
{"title": "70", "date": "Wednesday, April 19, 2017", "text": "Today I am 70.70!A big number.Of course, I can't help wondering how big that number will finally be.  Guess everyone thinks about how long they will live at some time or another.For some reason my 60s weren't a big deal.  I seldom thought about just how long I would live while marking each birthday anniversary in my 60s.  Maybe the 60s were a big deal for our parents or grandparents, but with the state of medical care and improved longevity today, the 60s were just a bump in the road for me.  Looking at my family history - my mother and her relatives lived well into their 80s - some into their 90s.  I am my mother's clone.  But there are no guarantees in this aging path for any of us.No matter how I wrap my mind around it, 70 is different.  To my ear, it sounds like I am talking about someone else's age - not mine.It is right about here ... when well meaning people (usually younger people) whip out the common platitudes about aging.  You know the ones ... age is just a number, you are only as old as you feel, age brings wisdom, you should be grateful for the years you have, etc. etc. etc.Make no mistake!  I am grateful for this 70th birthday.  Really!  Many people never get the opportunity to age - a few of those unfortunate folks were my peers.  So my feelings on this day are are filled with gratitude.Regardless ...  sweep all those typical feel good statements aside ... 70 is a big number to me.  I really really want it to sound like a smaller number.My guess is when I am facing 85 ... 70 will sound like a smaller number!  Ha!I noticed recently on CNN that the oldest person in the world just died at the age of 117.  How anyone knows out of the billions of people on this earth exactly who is \"the oldest person in the world\" - is beyond me.  But 117 years of age is a HUGE number.  I wouldn't aspire to that age - unless I could be sure to be mobile and of sound mind.  Since I am not sure I am of sound mind now (ha!), I guess that knocks me out of the running to beat her record.  I bet this lady would think that 70 is a small number.  But 117 years of age would be too big a number for me.  My world presently would look entirely different at the age of 117.  For example: the age of my oldest child if he survived would be 91 years of age.  Gads!!  Worse yet - if he didn't survive and I had to live through that loss.  No, no, no.  I most certainly do not want to live that long.That leaves me wondering which advanced age number would satisfy a desire to have lived a full life.  I couldn't begin to guess that number.  But I can confidently say that 70 is too young to say \"I have lived a full life.\" Hmm ... 70 .... too young.  I think I can live with that!!😛Happy Birthday to me."},
{"title": "The Master Bedroom - Condo Tour", "date": "Friday, April 14, 2017", "text": "A series of posts on my new home.As I go about my day in this new place I call homeI frequently think ...\"I like this (xyz) so much better.\"Maybe I should write about it.\"Many months ago I began a short series of posts introducing the condo we purchased in August 2016.  This post continues that series with pictures and comments of the master bedroom.Our master bedroom is about two thirds the size of our townhouse master bedroom.  But it is entirely adequate for our use - and in some regards, a great improvement.To begin with this room has 3 windows creating a great deal of natural light to off set the smaller size.  Our town house master bedroom had only 2 windows.  In fact this condo has SO MUCH natural light that special window treatments are needed to block the light for sleeping or to reflect the heat of the day during the summer months.  The window treatments have room darkening shades with additional temperature controlling features.The master bathroom is located down a short hall past and closets and is larger than our last master bathroom allowing for wheel chair access if that is ever needed.  It has a walk in shower stall with a built in seat.  Obviously this is designed for older adults who may at some point have special needs. Having taken care of an elder relative in my town home, I know just how important that walk in shower may be for us.  It also has double sinks and its own large linen closet which our townhouse master bathroom never had.And the both closets are bigger than our last master bedroom closets.  I used to have a separate closet aside from the master bedroom closets for off season clothes which involved switching clothes twice a year.  Not so here. Everything thing fits in my walk in closet with room to spare.So reduced bedroom floor space is a non-issue when other issues are considered.Finally, as the pictures suggest, this room serves as a 'safe place' for my dear elderly cats, Max and Wally. Their litter is in our bathroom and their food bowls are in a corner.  Their my bed is their throne - and there are two sunny 'perches' - one for each cat, to watch the world outside.  This safe space is barred from all visiting dogs.  The cats are totally adjusted to their new home which has been a bit of a surprise to us at their senior age.   In fact, they have become more friendly and attached to us over these last few months - I guess the townhouse was an easy place to lead a solitary life and the condo, being smaller, makes them more connected to us.We also LOVE the fact this room is located so close to our kitchen where the washer and drier is.  Doing laundry no longer involves climbing two flights of steps with loads of clothes.All in all ... this bedroom arrangement has provided a much improved style of living.Next up ... the living room and den!"},
{"title": "Hello again!", "date": "Thursday, April 13, 2017", "text": "Looks like I took another blog break.  I am not good at 'planning' the schedule of these posts!  They just seem to organically happen. But to say nothing has happened in this period would be a stretch of the truth.  It has been and continues to be a soul searching time for me.  I think moving into a true retirement, moving away from caregiving, adjusting to my husband's growing disabilities, moving from our home to a condo, and facing my 70th birthday this month ... well, let's just say I haven't given all that stuff enough importance in its impact on my life.  Those transitions have not fully settled in my brain and soul.One theme in my thinking that kept popping up was the future of my blog.  Did I still want to do this?  I guess I do off and on.  I can't seem to permanently pull the plug on this activity.   Although I don't feel the need to write like in more difficult days, I just can't hit the 'delete button' on the written record I have created in this space.  So I won't.  This blog will be my space for when the spirit moves me.  I guess it moved me today.Another theme that kept annoying me (really annoying me) was the time I seem to need to get from one place in life to another.  I have always been a 'get to it' kind of person, with little to no patience for those who don't adapt well to change.  This is not an element of my personality I am proud of but it is the practice of my life and thinking.  Now that 'get to it' attitude seems to have failed me.  I am still adjusting and adapting to the changes in my life over the last few years.  This time has been filled with a number losses and grief.  I have read over and over again .. time to recover from grief takes as long as it takes.  I know it is all normal - but it is still annoying.The final theme that has risen to the surface is that actions speak volumes - talk really says nothing at all.  So my actions have lead me to believe that I still am adjusting and grieving some, and still thinking about what is next ... now that all other avenues of my life responsibilities have reached an end.  I guess my actions say that I am great at completing the big tasks/stages of life, but I am not so good at moving into others.My actions?  Exercise - not to look better but to feel better.  It is taking way longer to see results than any other time in my life.  Ha!  Everything takes longer now!  I am still working on getting settled in the condo and getting the space adapted to our needs.  I knit. Despite my desire and talk about spinning and weaving (and buying equipment and supplies, etc. etc. etc.), knitting is what I do.  I have regular contact with my grand dogs and my cats.  Pets provide a balance through example that life can be really simple!  And I read.  Although the days are full something seems lacking.Beyond that ...

I had no idea how many book I read in a year.  Last year I picked a random number - 25!  Silly me.  I passed that number very early on.  The final 2016 total was 43 books.  The total was probably more since I don't think I logged every book.  And I know I started about 10 others that I lost interest in and abandoned without finishing.  My reading is a mix of Kindle and Audio.  It has been a few years since I have read an actual book.  I should give that a try once again.  I used to adore reading non-electronic books.My total of 43 for 2016 is really pretty low compared to some readers on GoodReads.  It is not unusual to see a goal of 75 or 100 books for the year.  I find that reading level pretty amazing.  That is about 2 books a week!!GoodReads sent out invitations again for 2017 and I signed up.  I think I picked a total a little closer to my reading history. This year -  45 books.  I probably should have picked a higher number because last year I had a gap in time (summer moving) when I wasn't reading much.  But I will go with 45 - you never know what the future may hold - and I do love reaching a goal!Have you ever joined a reading challenge?"},
{"title": "Reflections on 2016", "date": "Sunday, January 1, 2017", "text": "Hello all and Happy New Year.I know - gone again from blogging.  Not going to make excuses.  The spirit just didn't move me to sit in front of the computer and type.  But I still follow several blogs - one by my blog friend Paula inspired me to check in once again.  She reflected on the year 2016 - and I got to thinking - yep! 2016 is worth summarizing.1. What did you do in 2016 that you have never done before?My husband and I moved this year.  I orchestrated the entire process (downsizing 30 years of stuff, purchase of the condo, contracting the move, packing and unpacking, townhouse sale).  My husband's disability has severely limited his ability to assist.  There were times during those months when I thought the effort would kill me - but just like with previous challenges, I put one foot in front of the other and came out on the other side reaching the goal.  I kept reminding myself, if I was single I would be doing this same thing anyway.  I did have the support of family and friends towards the end when my health took a hit, but I survived the experience on pure stubborn-ness for sure!2. Did you keep your New Year's Resolutions? Will you make more for 2017?I don't think I had a New Year's Resolution.  Obviously if I did the answer to this question would be No - I didn't keep it if I can't remember it.  I did have a word for 2016.  It was MOVE.  Ha!  I meant for that word to reflect more physical movement and improved health.  I didn't achieve that - but I certainly did MOVE this year.For 2017 I have picked another word.  I wanted it to reflect what was lacking in 2016.  My new word for 2017 is CONSISTENCY.  I want better consistency in the key areas of my life:  exercise, improved diet/health, and, alas, blogging.  At times this past year I have considered closing down this blog.  I never seemed to do it.  So I am hoping to be more consistent in posting.These are not Resolutions, however.  I think the word 'resolution' dooms the effort for me!  3. Did anyone close to you give birth?No.  But we certainly would welcome new life in our family. 4. Did anyone close to you die?Yes.  Sadly, my dear dear grand-dog Grimace died early in the year.  No pet (including all the other cats and dogs that have graced our lives) has found such a deep caring place in my heart as that sweet Pug, Grimace.  He is so so missed.5. What countries or cities did you visit?None. We don't travel much any more and I do miss doing that.  Maybe someday but it is doubtful I will travel out of the country. There are too many places in this country I would like to see first.6. What would you like to have in 2017 that you lacked in 2016?Consistency.  Really.  2016 was consistently inconsistent.  In fact, the pattern of inconsistency started back in 2014.  In 2014 mom's health was failing.  Every week was a struggle and a sadness - and she died just after Christmas.  2015 was not much better.  The stability of my role as caregiver was gone and I didn't feel like I had another focus to anchor my life.  2016 was the height of inconsistency!  Uprooting our lives to improve them was extremely difficult and filled with many misgivings.  We are passed all that now.  2017 - looking for consistency.7. What was your biggest achievement of the year?We moved after 30 years in one place.  Nothing else comes close.8. What was your biggest failure?I didn't move - at least not the way I intended to move.  Striving for exercise activity in 2017.9. Did you suffer any illness or injury?Generally my health is pretty good - although I do feel that as I approach 70 years of age (April of this year), my strength is lagging.  I did fall ill with a few colds and GI complaints - and I did spend one night slumped over the kitchen table because that was the only comfortable position my spasmed back would allow.  But all in all - I can't complain.  That said - I think it is time to focus on boosting my health with better food choices and exercise.  You can't keep leaning on generally good health without putting in some effort - at some point that naturally God-given luck will give out and you better have put some effort into staying strong on your own.10. What was the best thing you bought?The condo.  Hands down - this was the best purchase we have made in years.  Although we lost about 1000 square feet of living space, we gained a hugh amount of convenience and freed up a decent amount of cash and time. I will finish the blog 'tour' of our condo in January.11. Where did most of your money go?This year the greatest expenditures were related to moving.  When the dust settled our bottom line financially had improved.  But money was spent and shifted at a enormous rate - all of it related to moving.   12. What did you get really, really, really excited about in 2016?It has been a long time since I got really really excited about anything.  I think I lost that ability during my caregiving years.  I worry that the experience may have altered my normally outgoing sunny outlook on life.  It certainly changed me.13. Compared to this time last year, are you:a)happier or sadder b)thinner or fatter c)richer or poorer?I guess I am a bit richer.  I am pretty much the same with regards to emotion and weight.14. What do you wish you had done more of?Exercise.  And I have to stop thinking in terms of 'wishing' when it comes to exercise!  Wishing gets you no where.15. What do you wish you had done less of?Worry.  Second guessing.  Doubting.  The last few years have been filled with too much of that.16. What is the best book you read?Well, I read (or listened to) 43 books this year (thank you Goodreads for keeping track).  The count is actually higher if you count the books I started and quit because they just weren't worth my time. I can honestly say that none of them would be described as 'best.'  I look for escapism in reading.  So I pick books that are pretty similar (apocalypse, zombies, weird themed mysteries, unusual life styles.)  My current book is about a female doctorate level psychopath who is an expert in medieval torture devices who works for a special CIA/FBI unit to hunt down criminal psychopaths. See what I mean?  Odd stuff.  None of it would count as 'best.'17. What did you want and get?I wanted to find a condo that would make our lives easier and safer.  Got that.18. What did you want and not get?I wanted a more flexible and energetic body.  I didn't get that because all I did was wish for it.  Nothing is ever gotten by wishing.19. What kept you sane?Knitting is my sanity pill.  Something about the repetitive and creative nature of this activity feeds my soul. 20. Who did you miss?My mom and my grand-dog, Grimace.Happy New Year Blog Friends!"},

I wish him well.  I want him to succeed because as President Obama stated, Mr. Trump's success will be our success.  I won't do anything in this blog, in person or on social media to tear down our President - now or in the future.  Respect for the opinions of a significant portion of our population must be allowed in a civilized democratic society.In the wake of this election, however, we are left with a lot of uncertainty - and for many fear.   In a very divided nation as we appear to be, there must be a place where we can reach a common ground.  I am not talking about policy or politics, nationally or regionally or even locally.  The common ground I speak of must be found individually between people - one relationship at a time. That is where the safety pin movement comes into play.I got this flag safety pin in the wake of 911.The safety pin movement is based on just a single undecorated safety pin.But I couldn't help bringing out my 911 pin for this effort.A plain safety pin visibly worn on the clothing is a symbol and a silent message to all of your support of anti-violence and anti-bigotry.  No words are needed.  Like a secret handshake - we can identify those who support the rights of all people - who are interested in providing a safe and respectful environment wherever you may be.The Safety Pin MovementPlease take the time to read the article about this movement and its origins.  Participate - show your support for the rights of all people.One paragraph in this article pretty much sums up the focus:\"Now there's a burgeoning effort in the United States for people to start wearing the safety pin ... in the face of post-election attacks and harassment.  Having to adopt a symbol of anti-violence and anti-bigotry is not exactly what any of us thought we'd be doing in the wake of a presidential election taking place in 2016, but it could be one small way to signal that you're an ally (regardless of who you voted for) to someone who probably didn't think they'd be in this vitriolic and volatile situation either.\"I am still upset about the result of this election - but this one small step forward makes me feel better.  And looking for other ways to make things better ... not matter how small ... it is worth the effort."},

{"title": "Knitted Shawl - Holden", "date": "Wednesday, November 9, 2016", "text": "One of the things that kept me from going crazy during the last 4 months was knitting.  Here are the pictures of my most recent finished object. This shawl pattern is call Holden by Mindy Wilkes.I have made this pattern twice and will probably make it again.  It is a very enjoyable and easy knit.The yarn is a gradient set by Miss Babs called Eucalyptus.  The gradient yarns contain graduated colors of 100% Superwash Merino wool - fingering weight yarn - 798 yards.  What does not show are the true colors.  It begins with a green into a blue into a tan into a pinkish tan into a pink.Here is the gradient set called Eucalyptus off the Miss Babs web site. Even these colors don't look like the ones in my kitOh well.  Guess you have to see it in person.The funny thing about this yarn was while I knitted, I decided I didn't like the colors.  I was disappointed with how they moved from one color to another.  I couldn't decide what made me purchase this mix of colors (all were packaged together as a group picked by Ms. Babs.)  Ms Babs colors are always stunning.  I figured this for a 'fail' but decided to finish it because I love the pattern.Once I finished the shawl - I still didn't care for it.  Then I blocked it.  Like magic, I decided I DID like it!  Blocking really is the 'wonder-action' that makes all things right in knitting."},
{"title": "The Condo - Guest Bedroom and Bathroom", "date": "Tuesday, November 8, 2016", "text": "A series of posts on my new home.As I go about my day in this new place I call homeI frequently think ...\"I like this (xyz) so much better.\"Maybe I should write about it.\"Before you peek into the guest room, a small disclaimer must be made.  The 'guest room' has a long- term resident in it already.  My yarn collection.  Beyond food, I seem to hoard yarn as well, but I like to call it a collection instead of a hoarding tendency.  Ha!  And to all knitterly visitors to this post, you should know, my yarn collection is big by my standards and average by the standards of other knitters ... apparently. So the guest room sometimes is called the Yarn Room. Anyway, here goes!The wall to the left houses most of my yarn for crafts.I say 'most' because some yarn is on the other wall and in the living room.OkIt is a yarn condo!I have always wanted to have an official guest room  In our townhouse we had lots of space and many rooms but no one room worked as well as this one does as a guest room  This is mostly because the possible townhouse guest rooms were either on the second level - near our rooms - limited privacy or in the basement.  Both required stair climbing to reach and most of our guests were not good on steps.  Frequently guests slept on an uncomfortable pull out couch or blow up mattress in the living room.Opposite wall - holds all my books, puzzles, games and other craft items, and some yarn, of course.  Sometimes this wall reminds me of a yarn shop.  Makes me smile.Masked \"Mousequerade.\"In this room I also have the remains of a stuffed animal collection.  I used to have many more stuff animals, but this collection was thinned down to what I thought I had room for (and to what I love most of all) in this new place.  Mousequerade is a collectable stuffed cat, who is masquerading as a mouse in a mouse cape with a basket full of cheese.  Obviously this sweet looking cat has 'plans' to trick some little mouse.Here is Mousequerade without the face mask and with his hood pulled back exposing such an appealing face.  My first (and dearly loved) cat in 1969 was a black and white tuxedo cat called Ashes.  This stuff animal reminds me of him.  When I saw this stuff animal in a gift shop in Savage Mill I was totally in love with him.  But the cost was ridiculous.  I couldn't justify it.  I walked away from him, but my brain would not let it go.  After about 5 days, my husband said - if he is still there go buy him.  He was still there!!  I never regretted this purchase.On the bed sits a stuffed white angel cat with white wings and glasses. I got this cat on our first trip to Maine.  It was sitting on a gift store counter next to the cash register.  As with Mousequerade, the moment I saw him I had to have him.  But we were visiting the area and would not be returning in 5 days.  So he left with me that day.  This sweet stuffed animal reminds me of a time when my husband and I could travel together with limitations.  I am so glad I fell into that impulse purchase.The bear is special because he wears my very first knitted sweater.  I took a 7 week learn to knit class back in 1997.  In the 90s I had a terribly stress filled job that I lived and breathed for about 4 years.  It made me into a uncaring and unhappy person.  To save my sanity and to bring back the person I was before being a manager, I quit that job with no job prospects in sight and I took a knitting class.   The sweater on this bear reminds me never to let others change who I am.  Never let circumstances make you a lesser person.  Be sure to remain caring to all.  Remember what is important in life.  This bear, which is not collectable at all, carries much on it sweatered shoulders.This desk was one of the two pieces of my mom's that I brought with me to the condo.  Actually the desk was mine as a child.  It is a simple drop leaf maple desk but I would never part with it.  It reminds me of mom and of my childhood.Here is another stuffed cat that is part of my small collection.  I just love the cat on its own, but in its arms is the silk flower corsage that my mom was given and wore on the day of my son's wedding.  My son was married on my mom's 60th Wedding Anniversary so she was recognized on that day with this corsage and a small matching silk bouquet of flowers.  It was a very special day - special for my son and his wife, and special because it was the best mom was mentally and physically before she began to seriously decline. I am still figuring out how to decorate, but the evolving theme is 'cats' and 'yarn.'The full bathroom off the second bedroom has two doors: one door is off the bedroom, the second door is off the living room.  It is a good size bathroom and would house a wheel chair or a walker if needed. It also has its own linen closet.Max our cat loves this room.Not all the cats in this room are stuffed!The guest room is a special room for me.  This is one think the townhouse didn't give me - one room with all my important things."},
{"title": "A pause in the story ...", "date": "Sunday, November 6, 2016", "text": "I guess I took an unexpected pause ...Not the pause that was planned or refreshes ... just a pause to cope.Last I wrote was September 21 - and I was in the middle of a \"condo tour.\"  I will get back to that with the next post.  But this post is about the \"pause.\"  Hard to believe it is now November 6.Our townhouse settlement date (or the giving away of a \"child\" I birthed) was scheduled for October 27.  As we move closer and closer to that date my focus on anything was a failure.  Of course, I had tasks to do related to the sale.   I visited the townhouse off and on, meeting with contractors, sweeping and raking periodically, collecting mail, chatting with the neighbors.  It kept me connected and engaged, but it also kept me emotionally tied to the property.I didn't sleep well the night before settlement.  I didn't think I would.The day of settlement my husband and I arrived in the lobby of the settlement company.  As we reached the front desk a man passed by us and approached a young couple sitting on a couch.  I heard him mention something about \" .... here for Setting Sun Way property.\"  I turned and said we were also here for Setting Sun Way property. I met the lovely young couple who was going to buy my dear townhouse.   And when I say \"lovely\" ... I totally mean it.  Before the settlement began, the woman said that she \"thought she knew my daughter\" and that I looked just like her.  Turns out she did know my daughter.  They went to high school together. She and her parents had lived in this neighborhood back then and she loved the area. This couple were very very excited about moving into the townhouse. She commented several times what good care I had taken of the unit.  Basically, she said all the right things.The knot in my stomach began to unwind.  Here was the perfect young family (they had a 10 month old child), who wanted to make a home in our home ... in our neighborhood ... around our neighbors ... because she loved it.You cannot possibly imagine just how relieved I was to meet this perfect people - who I would have chosen if I could - to live in my home.  When we left settlement I began to let go of the grip of steel I had on that townhouse for so long.  My \"child\" was going to a good family.On Halloween I was invited back to Setting Sun Way by a few of my former neighbors.  Halloween is a big deal in that community.  It was just one big happy mad house.  The new owners of the townhouse were just returning from somewhere and we talked for a bit.  My former neighbors came up and introduced themselves to the new owners.  It was a warm and welcoming time.  Before I moved on, the woman asked me if I would like to come in and see what they had done so far inside.  I declined.  As I told her, I got through settlement without tears, not sure I could go inside now without tears. I am beginning to feel a certain level of comfort in this condo.  It may never reach the level of \"home,\" but it will become more than just \"where I am living.\"  Now I am thinking about blogging again.  I am beginning to bring out some hobbies I previously abandon.  I am changing out some appliances that need replacing.  I am redoing some of the window treatments.  I am setting down some roots.And I am not visiting the townhouse.  It is now busy with other folks.  :-)Next time I will continue with the condo tour, and we will visit the guest room. Talk again soon."},
{"title": "The Condo - Kitchen", "date": "Wednesday, September 21, 2016", "text": "A series of posts on my new home.As I go about my day in this new place I call homeI frequently think ...\"I like this (xyz) so much better.\"Maybe I should write about it.The KitchenI am not a 'kitchen' person.  I could get along with much less kitchen.  Stunningly, my smaller condo came with a bigger kitchen.  Like twice the size. Sometimes I miss my smaller kitchen because I could work in that space efficiently - with just a turn get what I needed. Cooking is the main function of this room.  I don't enjoy cooking!  I cook to eat.  There is one exception to this - I enjoy making special dinners - like holidays, birthdays, company meals, etc. But the every day cooking, the several times a day kind of cooking - is pretty much a chore.Unfortunately eating is a requirement of life ... like breathing!  I do enjoy eating (and breathing) so I do what I have to do to get by.  What to say about the condo kitchen?  KitchenHa!  I didn't even wash the dishes for this picture.Surprisingly, I am happy with this kitchen!!First off ... the kitchen holds every 'kitchen thing' I own.  That might seem like an odd statement - but in the townhouse some kitchen things spilled into the basement (down a flight of stairs) and around a corner - down a hall - not nearby at all.  Some pantry items also were stored in the basement.   This kitchen is big enough to solve that problem.  PantrySpeaking of the pantry, most condos I have seen don't have a pantry.  My condo pantry is bigger than my townhouse pantry.  That feature is pretty sweet!  I tend to be a food hoarder - I know - sounds a bit contradictory - hates cooking / hoards food!  Answer - I am not much on being hungry.Pull out lower shelvesI do love the white cabinets!  But the real plus is their function.  They have pull out shelves in the lower cabinets.  Wonderful.  I have a pot carousel in the corner cabinet.  Amazing.  In the town house my lower shelves were sort of 'no-man's-land.'  Sometimes pots got just dropped into a heap in the lower cabinets because the space was so un-user friendly. My corner carouselThe most important appliance in the kitchen for me is a refrigerator.  It hoards stores food.  I could hand wash my dishes, use a hot plate and toaster oven for cooking, but I like a nice refrigerator.  The one in the condo has many problems: too small, exterior casing is damaged, one produce drawer broken, freezer on top rather than bottom.  But this refrigerator has one feature I totally adore - it has an ice maker.  I have never owned an ice maker and I use a lot of ice.   It is also a working unit so we will keep it ... until we have the money to replace it.There are other minor things that I like about this kitchen, but it has one feature I really really love.The washer and drier are located in the kitchen.  I totally LOVE the location.  Most condos do not have full size washer and driers - they have stackable units and many are located in hallways to save space.  I most certainly could get along with smaller units, but the luxury of having full size units in the kitchen is a big plus for me.So the judgement on the kitchen?  I'll keep it!"},

View of the community from the deck to the left.Almost every morning I slip outside to sit on this deck.  Morning coffee on the deck in my pajamas with my book or computer and my fierce wooden cat birdhouse (which no bird in their right mind would use) has become the start of many days.  My fierce cat bird house - entrance through the mouth.Definitely less deck but way more use than the larger deck. New space, new routines.So far so good."},
{"title": "The Condo - Path to the front door", "date": "Monday, September 12, 2016", "text": "A major concern was access.  It was simple: avoid steps.   For a time that criteria barred us from some very nice condos.  Second story and third story walk-ups were out. Our future might include a walker or even a wheel chair.  Sales of first floor condos were less common and when they did show up stairs would surprisingly be part of the access.There is an external foyer and locked hallway door.  People need to be buzzed in.This is not a feature I wanted particularly,but it has is uses.  We don't get door-to-door sales anymore.Then this 55+ community 2nd floor condo showed up.  It had an elevator.  Finally! The elevator is, of course, a safety feature for my husband.  Yes, all those townhouse stairs kept our legs strong for 31 years.  But in the last year the stairs caused my husband some problems.  Just like my elderly mom before, the positive effect of stair climbing turned on us - they became a risk.  This elevator was the answer to that problem.Our elevator... a requirement if we were going to be on an upper floor.Another unexpected plus to interior hallways are protection from the weather.  From a cleaning perspective, this hallway buffer to our front door is worth its weight in gold.  For years we tracked in the dirt, leaves, water, snow ... you name it ... from the community directly into our house.  Having the luxury of a carpeted hallway - no outside mess in the condo ...  is wonderful.The community streets and the hallways are well lit.  I spent almost 2 years trying to get improved lighting on the townhouse common area steps near our townhouse with no success.  No amount of reasoning would move the board of directors to improve lighting for anyone - even someone who was disabled.  Go figure.  Now that problem is solved as well.Our front door.But we don't live in hallway, so next time we will go beyond the front door.

{"title": "Fatigue ...", "date": "Friday, September 9, 2016", "text": "The month of September is quickly speeding along. It is hard to believe but this weekend we will have been in this condo for 4 weeks.  Some days (like when I am tired and discouraged) it seems like we are still living in someone else's house for an extended vacation.  Other days my mood is up, I am more rested, the space feels like it could be ours, and I am finally doing a few normal things again.  But mostly it still feels like someone else's condo.I think fatigue is the culprit. The main contributor is mental fatigue.  The moving/buy/sell process we started last year and stepped up this spring just never seems to end.  And I am so ready for it all to be over and settled.  The sale of our town home, while under contract, is not a problem free experience.  The actual 'sale' is not a done deal until settlement ... when signatures and money are exchanged ... so much can go wrong.  In fact there has been a hiccup or two with this prospective buyer already so my concern is not without merit.  Our agent is earning his fee as he maneuvers us through the mine field of selling property.Physical fatigue and stress cannot be minimized either.  Just when I think I am catching up, there are setbacks.  We had one of those setbacks this week.  Our townhouse is protected by a monitored alarm system.  We continue to use the alarm to protect the property since it is vacant.  A few nights ago at 11:15 pm, I got a phone call from the central monitoring desk.  Our alarm was tripped ... basement glass sensor.  They called me.  I was sound asleep.  The monitoring desk asked ... Do you want the police sent? Yes, send the police.  The property is vacant!  Will you meet them at the property?  Yes, we will meet them.  We were 15-20 minutes away.  But off we went in our pajamas on a wet dark stormy night.  When we got there everything looked fine from a distance.  But we were instructed to wait in our car - to not approach the property until the police arrived.  We waited an hour - no police!  I called the alarm company and they called the police again.  Apparently the police did arrived within 5 minutes of the call, checked the property, everything looked fine, and left.  We left as well crawling back into bed at 1:30 am.  And sleep came about an hour later.  As luck would have it, a very big storm went through our old neighborhood with a massive thunder/lightening event close by - setting off the sensor in the basement.  No harm done, except to our peace of mind and rest.So the effort of this move/buy/sell process continues - until the townhouse belongs to someone else.  Hopefully that will continue as scheduled to its logical end so that I can finally close this chapter and really move on.I have some blog post ideas in the 'hopper' but no energy or desire to post right now.  Still just putting one foot in front of the other.  But I thought I would stop by for a short update. Be back ... whenever!!"},

An open house was held on Sunday.  Apparently another 18 prospective buyers came through.  Two of them made appointments for this week to view the property a second time.  Nice.Then on Monday morning an offer came to us - a third person from the open house.  The offer was over our asking price.  That news was stunning to us ... of course the townhouse has to appraise at what was offered.  But still is was very welcomed.So now chapter two of our real-estate odyssey begins.  This chapter should not be as exhausting and in early October ... if the gods are with us ... we will be down to owning just one property.  The condo."},

They wrapped the furniture beautifully.   The move went without a hitch.  By 12:30 the movers were on the road to the condo with all my stuff.  I hung back with the excuse of closing up and putting the air conditioning back on.  I alerted my family the movers were on the way. I would follow shortly.It was a sad time knowing this final step had come to pass.  I would be back later that week to pick up a few final items, to arrange for cleaning, to touch up paint and to do all the little things forgotten in the busyness of the morning ... but this time was mine - a final private goodbye to a shelter I loved for almost half of my life.As I drove away I knew the hardest part was over.  When I arrived my family and friends had set out the food, the movers were having lunch, enjoying some cool air, and taking a small break before unloading. The rest of the day was a blur for me.  I was so tired.  But I couldn't seem to sit either.  Nervous energy I guess.  I helped direct the location of items as they came in.  My kids helped get the kitchen set up as boxes were delivered.  By the end of the day, all the furniture was set in its spots, the kitchen  could be used and the bed had sheets on it.  We could survive here while the dust settled.I had survived moving day!

{"title": "The Day After Settlement", "date": "Saturday, August 27, 2016", "text": "We signed on the dotted line (a gazillion times!) on settlement day.  The rest of time I was bonded to my couch and blanket.  Around 6:30 pm - I went to bed.  After weeks of pushing the limits of my endurance, it felt decadent to go to bed so early.  The bed felt wonderful and sleep came rapidly.But by 3:00 am I was up again ... this time hungry ... and ate a toasted bagel with lots of butter and salt.  It was divine!  Then back to bed again and more sleep.  I was certainly on the mend if I could eat a whole bagel.The next day - the day after settlement - friends and family arrived to help move the mountain of stuff that was not assigned to the movers.  As each person arrived, they graciously inquired about my health, hoped I felt better, commented on my peaked appearance, etc. etc. etc.  Everyone made appropriate polite suggestions - keep drinking, eat as you can, take frequent rests, we will help.Then my sister and her husband arrived - last - coming from the furthest away.  She walked directly into the kitchen where I sat, started out with the normal inquiry ... \"how are you feeling,\" and then without taking another breath said ... \"You look like hell!!!\"  Hahaha!  It was good to laugh.  Only a sister can call it like she sees it, and get away with it!  My son quickly responded, \"She looks much better. You should have seen her yesterday.  She looked like the crypt keeper's daughter!  Gray and all.\"  Another laugh. I was thankful I looked that good yesterday.  On settlement day I felt like the crypt keeper's grandmother!Truly I felt better that morning.  Salted and buttered bagels are miracle carbs.  But I still needed to sit frequently.The mountain of stuff disappeared quickly into waiting cars and trucks.  Off we went to see what all our signatures bought!  With so many hands helping the job went quickly leaving time to visit to visit at the condo.  But in the back of my mind I was really dreading the next day.  Movers would come and we would truly be moved out of our home and living in someone else's home -Well ... technically my home but ... you know what I mean. More later."},
{"title": "Settlement Day", "date": "Saturday, August 27, 2016", "text": "Between visits to the bathroom and collapsing on the bed, a few decisions got made.I knew settlement must go on.  Too many other arrangements hinged on this process.  I just wasn't sure how to make it happen.Once again our agent showed his worth.  Since my husband really couldn't see to do the walk thru of the condo without me at 10:00 am ... and I pretty much \"married\" to my bathroom  ... the agent suggested doing the walk thru on his own.  He reported back that all was well.He also arranged for the settlement to be performed in two parts.  The sellers coming from Pennsylvania completed their portion of the settlement at the original time of 11:00 am.  And our portion of the settlement was scheduled for 3:00 pm - in hopes that my symptoms would pull back a bit.  And they did. Of course, I could not drive - but that was resolved by our son who was scheduled to attend the settlement to assist his father with signing the documents.  Who would have guessed he would be helping both of us.By the time 3:00 arrived I had been able to keep down small sips of fluids for about 4 hours.  That was good.  It gave me the energy to walk.The agent made sure our meeting was schedule close to a bathroom.  Early in the meeting I joked about the need for me to exit for a \"smoke break.\"  Everyone chuckled, but if the bathroom hadn't been close, it wouldn't have been funny.  Seriously.  This \"never smoked in her life\" lady took advantage of several smoke breaks.All went well for the first 20 minutes until I just ran out of energy.  I got quiet ... talking required too much effort.  I resisted the desire to just place my head on the table.  The settlement attorney stepped up the speed a bit.  All was summed up pretty quickly.  After a final smoke break we headed to my son's car.When we stepped outside I felt a little better.  I had gotten so cold in the building.  I was grateful for the outside heat.  Of course it was 100 degrees in the shade.  Never in my life have I enjoyed 100 degrees!Once in our parking lot I felt pretty unsteady.  Climbing twenty steps to our front door was a struggle.  At home I wrapped myself in a blanket and laid down on the couch.  I began to feel a bit better just being prone.So ended settlement day.  Now we owned 2 residences.  But at that point, I was mostly glad we owned a couch and a blanket.Till next time."},

If there was one piece of good luck in this whole process it was getting this agent!!That night, about 3:30 am, I woke up - not unusual, but this time my stomach was not right.  I headed for the bathroom.  I looked at myself in the mirror and said, \"You are not going to be sick.\"  And I promptly was sick.  Diarrhea and vomiting!  I could not believe it.  I talked myself into ... this is nerves!  You have made yourself sick with fatigue and stress.  You will be just fine! At 4:30 am - it was confirmed.  I had a diarrhea vomiting bug!  How lucky can one person be.By 6:00 am I knew I could not make a 10:00 am condo walk thru - and the 11:00 am settlement.

{"title": "One more week ...", "date": "Monday, August 8, 2016", "text": "The crunch is on!Sort update - no time for more.We live surrounded by boxes and yet even as I open drawers and cabinets - I see things that need to go into a box.  Yikes!!To keep my sanity and health, I decided it is ok to have some items left behind after moving day.  After all, I have to return to clean up and prepare the townhouse for sale - I can retrieve stray items during those visits.  That is a huge concession from a type-A personality like me.My body is very very tired.  My brain is going in a million different directions.  Rest periods during the day are the only way I continue to move forward.  Last week I had a full day that ended up as the rest period.  The energy it takes to keep moving forward is owned by a far younger person than I am.We settle this Friday morning on the condo.  Starting that afternoon family and friends will be helping me move the extraneous items (and there are a bunch), that don't fit in boxes or are best moved by loving hands.  Saturday and Sunday there will be more of that kind of moving - with the professional movers coming on Sunday morning for the furniture and the boxes - 72 boxes so far. I keep thinking that by Monday - a week from today - we will be moved in to the condo, but reality forces me to accept that we will be moved in completely (not unpacked), by the following Monday - 2 weeks from today!!Never again!You've heard it here.The next move I make will be orchestrated by my children into a one room Assisted Living facility!Probably in a month or two!  Ha! \"See\" you on the other side of the move."},

Ready or not - here we come!!Packing seems never ending.  Empty boxes seem to disappear to be replaced with stacks of labeled and sealed boxes, and yet unpacked items still remain.  Some things just defy boxing - so a stack of things that must be moved without boxing is starting to grow. In my mind, I see moving day as a time when everything gets carried out - leaving the townhouse totally empty except for a few cleaning supplies.   I suspect, however, this process will spill into the following week as I clean up the townhouse one final time for sale.  I would prefer a \"clean\" move ... a house that is full this day, empty the next ... but I wonder if I can pull that off.How people move from one state to another in a single action I will never know.  I am moving across town.  I will still be in the area to vacate any last items ... but what if that wasn't an option.  Yikes.In fact, I can't imagine how people move frequently.  Military families do this all the time.  I guess the effort needed to move is a good argument for not putting down \"roots\" in any one place.  My roots run very deep here. Emotionally I continue to have my sad moments as I extract my self from this home.  I don't allow myself to dwell on it long because these emotions are counter productive to reaching my goal.  I have have honored this house in my heart for the last year.  Now it is time to move on. But still ... I drove by the new condo yesterday while I was out on other chores.  With every visit I am reminded why we decided this place was good.  Although it is located within hearing distance of a major road, it is also across the street from a property that has horses.  It is within 1/4 mile of a shopping center with a grocery store and other retail.  Walking distance!  It is part of an established neighborhood. Reminding myself of the \"why\" and the \"where\" seemed important ... even if it was a decision that was beyond changing - at the 10 day mark!And would I change my mind if that was an option?  No.  I would not change my mind.  My husband needs a safer environment.  I need less house (and stuff) in my own life, and we both will benefit from no steps. In less than two weeks our home base will change.  The time is very close now."},
{"title": "A Theory About Boxes", "date": "Tuesday, July 26, 2016", "text": "I have a theory about boxes that has begun to grow in scope as I clean out and pack up all my worldly possessions ... and it surprises me just a bit.In the last year I have been brutal about downsizing stuff.  This house in its hayday probably held the contents of 3 families.  Over the last year I have carried out or hired someone to haul away about half of that stuff.  Yes, much was inherited, much was collected by us, and then there was the I \"may need it someday\" stuff.  You get the idea!  I have been relentless for about a year. And still ... the packing of what remained birthed the \"box theory.\"The box theory began as a small seed in my brain.  A move date was on calendar.  The future square footage was known.   Packing began and a stack of boxes began to grow.  Somewhere about box #10 (packing boxes gets old very fast - I can assure you!), I started to look at boxes as a gate keeper to the new condo.  The small stack of boxes began to weigh on me.  Previously loved and valued items started to become less valued.  My brain started to prioritize what I really wanted - not just what I thought I wanted.  Things that I previously kept were not loved quite enough to make it into a box. And that in a nutshell is the box theory - if you have to box it up and move it - the boxes become a sort of gate keeper.I am up to 48 boxes packed.  We are estimated by the mover to have 100 boxes!  Although I look around and see a lot of empty spaces, I still see a lot of stuff.  What I have packed and what I have left to pack continues to weigh on me - so the box theory will be the final filter of decluttering.What continues to be remarkable - is that I don't miss anything I have gotten rid of.  Nothing.  In fact, now that a lot of our stuff is in boxes, I don't seem to miss that stuff either!  Who knows, maybe the boxes aren't the final gatekeeper.  Maybe the condo will be the last gatekeeper.  As I unpack I may decide - hey, why did I move this thing!  We have about 3 weeks before we move.  The finish line is in sight!"},
{"title": "Moving ... all the time", "date": "Tuesday, July 19, 2016", "text": "Just a short check-in to let you know I still live!Each day is filled from first light to dinner's end with details, on top of details, on top of yet more details.  Needless to say it is a very busy time.The inspection of the condo turned up a totally ready property - no hidden problems. Visiting it again with the inspector confirmed how much we love the set up of this floor plan and the building generally.The mortgage process is almost complete - with no hidden problems there either.  The only \"problem\" is paying a mortgage after years of no monthly payments.  But that will resolve when the townhouse sells and we can pay off the loan.The downsizing and packing also continues.  Some furniture left our house for our son's home last weekend and a few last pieces will be donated at the end of the month.  I think I have estimated fairly well what furniture will fit in our newly reduced living space.  Only time will tell however.  The parade of objects leaving for new homes continue, but at a markedly reduced rate.  As I unpack on the condo end - it will be only loved items  - not the extras that have cluttered my life for so long.  That feels good.  The packed boxes are growing.  Empty room spaces are also growing.  Progress.Moving weekend plans are forming.  Family and friends are holding dates.  It will be helpful to have friendly faces around me on that stress filled weekend. Through it all there are 2 constants that are with me all the time.  I am tired and I feel a low grade anxiety.  Fatigue is normal - and will eventually resolve when everything is done.  Anxiety?  Well that is normal as well.  This townhouse holds the memories of almost half my life.  Never have I lived anywhere so long.  Something that shelters so much of your existence and holds so many memories can't help but take on an emotional attachment. The townhouse is just a \"thing,\" in the eyes of many ... and yet, for me ... it isn't.  It is the only loved thing left that I can't put in a box and take with me.Don't know when I will be checking in again.  But I will be back!"},

Move!I chose this word because I wanted to keep my body moving.  Looks like it will be more representative of an actual move of residence."},
{"title": "My Life List - Monday, June 27", "date": "Monday, June 27, 2016", "text": "I am joining the blog Smidgens, Snippets and Bits in sharing \"My Life List.\"What am I thankful for ...Crazy but I struggle with the public gratitude thing.  I'm thankful for so many things in my life, but it sometimes feels ingenuous to carry on about it in public.  Of course, this opinion is not in vogue.  Advice frequently is ... you would be happier only if you kept a gratitude journal or if you 'practiced' regular thankfulness.  While I agree, I think it is the private reflection that provides the most peace for me.  So next week I will find something else here. And I am thankful I can do that!  :-)Discovery time ....This weekly snap shot - My Life List - is a great way to keep connected on the blog.  I get to chat about a variety of topics in a brain dump style. Outside my window ...Hot, moist, sometimes stormy.  In fact, last week when I took the puppy out for his first walk of the day, something had hatched a bunch of wormy things on my sliding glass door.  Gross!  I could never live in the tropics.Inside my window ...Air conditioning!!  No worms on the outside (or inside) of my sliding glass today.  Life is good.  Ha!What I am reading ....I am reading the second book in The Olivia Series by Yael Politis.  The first book was called Olivia, Mourning.  The second is called The Way the World Is.   And the title certainly fits. This book picks up the Olivia story with no gap in the action and includes a bit of the Underground Railroad prior to our Civil War.  The underground railroad was a secret effort by abolitionists to rescue slaves from the southern slaves states to northern territories in Canada.   Thankfully I was never raised with prejudice against different races so the attitudes of the pre civil war era seem terribly foreign to me.   It can certainly be said our country has made large strides in race relations, but I believe it will be many generations (if ever) before the human race is color blind.  Until we stop handing down our prejudices to our children, the theme of this book, The Way the World Is, will sadly continue to ripple through our human experience over and over again.  This is a very good series.What am I watching on TV ...This past week I re-discovered America's Got Talent.  There are some remarkably gifted people.  What appeals is that you never know what is coming out on the stage next.  Each audition is entirely different.  Singing, dancing, magic acts, circus style acts, even some that defy categorization.  And the exceptional talents are balanced by the hysterically funny but terrible 'talents.'And I am still watching Nurse Jackie on Netflix.  There are 7 seasons and I am in season 4.  Happy One, one of my friends and readers, said she stopped watching when it got too depressing.  The story line has had serious and humorous elements, but I can see now the serious side of this story is starting to monopolize the episodes.What am I creating ...I started a new shawlette pattern this week called The Holden.  No pictures of my work to show yet because I am in the early stages.  Maybe next week.  But here is a picture of someone else's finished project. Credit:  https://espacetricot.wordpress.com/2012/06/15/free-pattern-friday-holden-shawlette/I will say that this kettle dyed yarn shows of the beauty of the pattern probably better than the yarn I picked.  I am just not that good at matching yarn to patterns.  My yarn is a gradient - going from a dark greenish turquoise to a cream with the cream being used in the lace areas. I love this pattern.  I am hoping the lace edging is not to challenging.  The shawl can be made in several sizes - this picture shows a full shawl size.  I plan to make a shawlette this time - smaller scarf-like version.  But I have several yarn choices lined up for larger versions of this pattern.What I am pondering ...I love, love, love knitting.  I have dabbled into related fiber pursuits like spinning and weaving. They fall in the \"like\" category.  Not in the \"love, love, love\" category.  I often wonder why it is that some hobbies bring great joy to one individual while other individuals find great joy in something else.  Guess it is the beautiful part of being complex creatures.  To bad that \"love, love, love\" feeling we have for various activities doesn't spill over into our interpersonal relationships with other human beings who are different from ourselves.A quote I quote ...“Properly practiced, knitting soothes the troubled spirit, and it doesn't hurt the untroubled spirit either.” ― Elizabeth ZimmermannMy week - a Peek ...More dogs, more knitting, more walking, and more downsizing. In the continued search for a place to move, the common theme is - the space we move to will be small.  My desires have crystalized over the last few months.  Location and condition are everything.  Size falls further down the wish list.  Downsizing efforts now will make that move easier whenever to happens.What keeps me awake at night .... Actually I am sleeping a little better lately.  Ha!  So nothing is keeping me awake - except for some restless legs between 3:00 am and 6:00 am - and even that is much reduced!Word of the Year ... Move!Getting my step count up has been a challenge, especially coming off a week of puppy watching.  Yes, I was moving, but it wasn't always the kind of movement captured well on a pedometer.But I have a new 'mind trick' to keep me moving.  Here is a picture of my Bullet Journal tracking system - the method I am using in June to document my progress.  Simple, easy to maintain and visual.I have a ways to go to reach 10,000 steps consistently.  Without intense focus on the daily numbers, however, this method shows the trends - the big picture -which is all that really counts for me right now.  At my age, it isn't about the distance, or the time or the speed ... it is about moving. I know electronic devices can provide this history with fancy grafts far better than my simple efforts, but I am not so bitten by the electronic bug that everything is better on that platform.  I prefer the analog methods.My initial goal continues to be 10,000 steps a day.  But 12,000 to 13,000 steps a day would be better.  I believe the health benefits will be more remarkable in that range. One step at a time.  I will get there."},

Discovery time ....I am taking care of my son and daughter-in-law's two dogs this week while they are on a cruise.  I discovered that I can go to sleep around 10:00 am and get up rested at 5:30 am - the dog's normal rise and shine time.  And they are so chipper at 5:30 am.  Me ... not so much.Outside my window ...It is heating up this week.  We are at the beginning of summer and things will be getting hotter and more sticky.  After all, I live in Maryland, the capital of the world for humid heat, other than the tropics, and maybe Florida (ha!).  Air conditioning is such a wonderful humane invention!Inside my window ...My days are busy busy busy with a puppy who is only partially potty trained.  I am beginning to read his body language well enough inside so I can get him outside in time.  But this potty training of a puppy is hard work!What I am learning ...Nothing this week! Ha.  I guess my 'smart container' is all full up.  :-)  Famous last words.What I am reading ....I am reading on my Kindle an absolutely wonderful book called Olivia, Mourning by Yael Politis.  I am about 50% into the story and it is very very good.  Here is the book description offered by the publisher. Historical Fiction.  Olivia wants the 80 acres in far off Michigan that her father left to whichever of his offspring wants to stake a claim.  The problem: she's seventeen, female, and it's 1841.  Mourning Free knows how to run a farm and Olivia has complete trust in him.  The problem: he's the orphaned son of runaway slaves and reluctant to travel and work with a white girl.  Not without qualms, they set off together.  All goes well, despite the drudgery of survival in an isolated log cabin.  Strong willed, vulnerable, and compassionate, Olivia is a compelling protagonist on a journey to find a way to do the right thing in a world in which so much is wrong.I generally do not enjoy historical fiction, but I do enjoy stories of survival in circumstances that are beyond my experience.  This is Book 1 in a trilogy and I am planning on picking up Book 2. What am I watching on TV ...I have started watching Nurse Jackie on Netflix.  I am into season 3.  I enjoy medical shows but for some reason I kept passing over this one until I ran out of other options.  It is really very good.  It took me a few episodes to get hooked, but now I am loving all the shows.  It is the story of an emergency room nurse who does everything she can to provide her patients with the best care possible while navigating the waters of a crumbling health-care system.  But she has a secret that is increasingly difficult to keep from people - she relies on Vicodin and Adderall to get her through high-stress sifts at a New York hospital.What am I creating ...This section should be called what I have created.  Here it is.What I am pondering ...How long will it take for my hair to grow back?  My hairdresser's shop closed suddenly, and I was unable to reach her for about a week.  So I went to a local uni-sex barber shop - and oh my - did I get chopped.  So short.  I will say it is cooler this way.  But I prefer a bit more hair on my head.  I am scheduled for an appointment with my regular hairdresser later in the summer, but I am hoping what little I have grows back in enough for that visit. A quote I quote ...Handle every stressful situation like a dog.  If you can't eat it or play with it, just pee on it and walk away.My week - a Peek ...Dogs, dogs and more dogs.  And more 5:30 am mornings!  Glad it is at least light outside when we open the door.What keeps me awake at night ....My hips and my bladder.  I sure am tired of it.  Does anyone know where I can get some replacement parts? Word of the Year ... Move!I am sure falling short on my 'move' goals.  More on that another time."},

As I mentioned in a previous knitting update, the progress of some lace projects are hard to assess until they are stretched out and blocked.  Until that step step is taken, the project looks pretty much like a knitted mess as it sits in your lap.  This lace shawl was knitted mostly on faith.   I had to trust that this pattern was coming out correctly and that the size would be big enough.  I am not a big fan of that kind of knitting - surprises at the end are not always good surprises. But now that this shawl is stretched out on the blocking board, I can see the pattern well.  I can confirm that there are no hidden errors.  It all turned out as pictured in the printed pattern.  Thank God!This shawl is for my daughter.  Although it is not a birthday present, I will save it till her birthday later this month.  It is a 'big' birthday.  The big ones can be hard.  Best to offer some distractions."},

Honeymoon was over.A partial play-by-play:Out the front door for pee and poop.  Good dog.Puppy eyes noticed a yard full of cookies (mulch) - yikes!  Not good.  Much digging in his mouth to remove stuff. Back in for his breakfast (eaten with breath taking speed!  So much for my own potty break.)Opps.  Poop on the rug!  Lesson #1 - always, always, always take puppy right out after eating.  Always! No matter how much they pooped and peed outside in the last 10 minutes, always!Out the door to pee!  Another mouth sweep for mulch cookies.  Another poop!  (wow, 3 poops).  Clean bottom of shoe of poop. *sigh*  Bright side, however, pooping done!Back in for more play .. and water. Play with Grandma as she closes the sofa bed and covers the couch.  Puppy eyes - New game!!  tug of war with couch cover.  Lesson #2 - crate the pup if you want to do something that normally takes 10 minutes but with 'help' ... takes 60.Squat to pee on the rug - Lesson #3 - set the timer for 15-20 minutes reminders to take the puppy out. Ding!  Timer goes off.  Out again.  Pee again. Poop again. (AGAIN! - this little dog is all colon.) Mouth sweep - AGAIN!Back in for more 'games.\"  Re-set the timer.Puppy Eyes - New Game!! The 'attitude adjustment spray water bottle' ... never assume it will be taken seriously.  Lesson #4 - EVERYTHING can be a toy, even a spray of water in the face.Barriers are no barriers for big bull doggie paws.  *sigh* Lesson #5 - wedge barriers firmly - and hope that visually impaired husband doesn't trip because he forgot about the gates.Ding!  And we are off and running again.Those are big doggy paws.  I wonder about them!All that before my morning coffee!Later, nap time on the couch with Grandma!  It is 10:30 am.  Busy, busy morning for all.Playing with a toy that no one has played with for probably 2 years.Just like child birth, however, you forget what a pain he has been when he sits at your feet and looks up at you with that sweet puppy dog stare and that stubby tail shake.  He follows me all over.  Loves to sit or play touching some part of you.  I suppose he might take me more seriously if I wasn't laughing the whole time.He loves to stay glued to your ankles.It has been just a wonderful morning!  Really!  Puppy love.  It isn't forever.  Enjoy the ride.Nothing says \"I love you Grandma\" than those eyes!"},
{"title": "Becoming Minimalist", "date": "Thursday, June 9, 2016", "text": "Inspiration!Most people are influenced by inspiration.  They are exposed to an idea or an example and they find themselves drawn into a new path of awareness or action.  That has been my experience with downsizing and decluttering.  My personal journey towards less has been shared here in my blog - and several wonderful readers have let me know my sharing has inspired them.  Thank you.  I think that is how some movements are started - inspiring each other and passing it on.I do not aspire to become a card carrying minimalist, but I do find inspiration in that movement.  I do strive to free myself from the weight of things for very selfish reasons.  I am freeing myself from extra work of maintaining stuff (sadly no hired help in my future,)  reducing stress (which I seem to have more than my share over the last 10 years,) and reducing distractions (the ability to focus seems to be the first mental ability to fail as we age. *sigh*)  In addition, it makes my visually impaired husband's life just a little less frustrating.So let me share with you a blogger who has inspired me.BecomingMinimalist.comJoshua Becker is the writer of Becoming Minimalist and he is the author of the book The More of Less.  I love the title of his blog because it suggests that minimalism is an ongoing process not a final destination.  His blog was born from a place where we have all \"visited\" in one way or another:  dedicating precious time to the management of stuff rather than to people we love and experiences we desire.He had the typical life filled with a happy family, a satisfying job, a normal house and an all too familiar over abundance of stuff.  His story begins one weekend when he decided to clean out his garage.  His 5 year old son also wanted a piece of his time to play in the backyard.  With promises to play when the cleaning was done, he proceeded to empty the garage onto the drive way to approach this task in a thorough and logical way.  Soon he was overwhelmed by the enormity of the exposed stuff and the effort it was going to take.  It was then that his neighbor casually commented: \"Maybe you don't need to own all this stuff.\"  From that simple statement he quickly realized what mattered was time with his son and not the stuff in the driveway.  Inspiration in its most infantile form!  That experience sparked the beginning of a new way of living that he shares in his blog.  I don't have a garage or a 5 year old child, but strip away the window dressing of that story, and his sudden realization was mine as well - it just took me a little longer.  I encourage you to visit his blog and see if his experience could also be yours.Recently he hosted a guest post from Sarah Peck.  Her story is titled:  The Story of Enough: Giving Up (new) Clothes for One Year.  Although I have never been into collecting clothes I took time to read her story.  The clothes saga is the window dressing of her story.  The underlying truths can be nailed down to a few words -  I have enough.  I am enough.  And \"enough\" is different for everyone.Yes, that is EXACTLY what I believe.I have captured a few of her quotes below.  I encourage you to check out her post on BecomingMinimalist.com - and maybe spend some time visiting with Joshua Becker.  I don't think you will be disappointed.QuotesSara PeckThe Story of Enough: Giving Up (new) Clothes for One Year.\"Our world is filled with messages that tell us we don't have enough space, enough stuff, enough clothes, enough fitness.  We're never skinny enough or pretty enough or good enough or rich enough.\" \"...the idea of minimalism isn't about reaching a goal or checking off a box, or reaching a certain destination.  To me, minimalism is realizing that what I already have is enough, and that adding clutter to the pile won't make it any better.\"\"Stripping away the excess lets us get to the bones of what really matters.  Get to the heart space.  Get to the pieces that are important.  And that level can be different for different people.\"\"Untethering from the need to consume was surpassingly easy.  It was the attitude change that made the most difference: looking through my things and realizing I already had enough. ...  It was relaxing and reassuring to know that what I had was okay.  What you are is already good enough.\"\"Sometimes a subtle attitude shift or a small sacrifice can make a big difference.  Like taking the time to appreciate that what you already have is enough.  And your effort?  It's enough.\""},
{"title": "My Life List - Monday, June 6", "date": "Saturday, June 4, 2016", "text": "I am joining the blog Smidgens, Snippets and Bits in sharing \"My Life List.\"Thankful for ...Pod casts and audio books.  I discovered the joys of audio entertainment when my husband start to lose his vision and was forced to transfer his personal library into auto formats.  Talk about a silver lining to a dark cloud!  Although there are times when reading (and owning) an actual book is preferred, mostly I am happy to listen to the audio version allowing freedom do other things. Outside my window ...No rain!  Sun.  Finally.  My world is very green at least for now.Watching this ...I have been watching a TV series called The Sixties.  This 10 episodes series can be found on Netflix and covers the turbulent and changeable decade of the 1960s.  I recommend it. Here is a brief listing of what that decade contained.TV comes of Age, The Berlin Wall, Bay of Pigs Invasion, Cuban Missile Crisis, Assassination of JFK, the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights Movement, The Beetles and all the British music groups, The Space Race and the man on the moon, the RFK/MLK assassinations, riotous Democratic convention, Nixon's rise to power, social change sparking feminism and the legalization of birth control and gay rights, culture changes with relation to sex and drugs, and Rock and Roll.    Wow, that was a full 10 years.  Those were my high school and college years and I remember all these events.  But it wasn't until I watched this series of episodes that I realized just how big a decade it was.Pondering this ...Why is it necessary that I MUST lay down sometime between 1:00 and 3:00 to \"rest my eyes\" every single day, even after I have slept well at night, even after I have had plenty of water to drink and not dehydrated, even when I have had a relatively quiet morning.  Why, why, why!!  Three years ago I didn't need to do that!!Quoting this ...I am a fan of Mark Twain's outlook on life. My week - a Peek ...This week started on a high note and a low note.  On a high note - We enjoyed lunch with good friends.  We don't get out as much as we used to - my husband's limited vision makes these kinds of excursions a bit more of a challenge for him - but they are still important.  Friends are one of the gems of life.  On a low note - we found a wonderful condo that we almost placed an offer on.  But when saner heads prevailed over the weekend, we decided to pass on it.  It was located about 30 minutes north of our current location.  Although 30 minutes doesn't sound all that far, when you are as close as 10 minutes to your family support system, adding another 30 minutes to that commute is not appealing.  Oh well, we will be patient and hope that the summer will produce another condo possibility.  The rest of the week is uneventful.What keeps me awake at night ...I worry (mostly between 2:00 and 4:00 am) that moving my visually impaired husband out of this townhouse (a home he knows intimately) is a mistake.  We both agree we should have a residence that would allow us to live on one level.  At a minimum, we should live in a place where we could reach our front door easily with a walker or wheel chair.  Sadly, this town home is not that place.  But right now, in this minute, we are able to live here comfortably.  Is it an over reaction to move before the need is there or is it the adult thing to do before we are forced by circumstances?  It is easy to talk yourself into staying in a home you love and can manage now.  It is the comfortable and simple choice.  But just when you have yourself convinced that it is ok to stay ... your husband misses the last step on a flight of steps and falls on his hip.  And that is exactly what he did on Sunday.  He is ok, but ... guess it is not ok to stay here. That is it for this week in my little corner of the world."},

Unbelievable. I feel like if I blink, I will miss summer entirely, skip fall and be facing winter ... again!I willingly admit that as I age I have a love hate relationship with time.  I love that I have more free time day-to-day than at any other point in my life.  I love that I can do nothing for a day - pushing planned to-dos into the future, because there is more time in my future than ever before (hopefully.)  I love that through the passage of time I have learned to be more respectful of the time gift I have been given ...  'retired time' when I can do mostly whatever I want.  I love all that.  You don't get to 69 without knowing that some folks never get that gift.But there is a hate side to this equation.  I hate that my future time can be counted in mostly years and not in many decades.  I hate that at 69 I don't have 69 more years ahead of me.  In fact, in just one small decade I will be 79 - a time when the chances of living another decade are considerably smaller.  I hate that because of time my mortal body is starting to have problems - that my 'retired time' will be shared with an aging body that has a built in obsolescence.I need to put the skids on time - slow it down.  But how is the question.Think, think, think ...I've noticed that when you aren't paying attention to time, it speeds up and slips away.  If you are paying attention and are more mindful of the moment - time seems to slow down.  I may have read that somewhere.  In truth,  that is just a 'mind game' as time never slows down or speeds up - just keeps ticking away - totally irregardless of what individuals do.  It is only our perception of time that may change with attention to it.Maybe time is like a fortune of gold coins.  The quantity of time or gold coins is a fixed number - unknown and different for everyone.  Each minute spent is a gold nugget that cannot be replaced.  How each golden minute is spent is in our control - not much else is within our control.  But can that approach put the skids on time?Maybe trying to slow down time is the wrong approach.  Maybe the best way to handle time is to see it through the eyes of a dog. My dear grand dog, Grimace who passed away this spring ... who never pondered time,who lived in the moment, who spent his golden nuggets of timemaking others happy.That face says, \"This is the moment that counts, Grandma.  Not yesterday, not tomorrow.  Just today.  Now can I have that treat you are holding?\"I am still learning Grimace.  I am not as smart as you."},
{"title": "Right sizing", "date": "Monday, May 30, 2016", "text": "I recently read the term \"right sizing\" in a blog post on Miss Minimalist.Miss Minimalist hosts a weekly post featuring readers who are pursuing a minimalist life style.   Those posts very interesting as they allow you to peak into the lives of folks making big changes.    This Monday she hosted \"Heather in Texas\" who used the term \"right sizing.\"Yes! That is what I am doing.  Getting things to a size that fits me!  What a great term.  It does not dictate a one-size-fits all style of living.And in truth, I think it is what we all do in our lives.  Size it to fit our desires.It got me thinking.  Why did it take so long to seek out my own personal right size?  Some of the writers on Miss Minimalist are in their 20s.  Amazing that they should be so independent of thought at such an early age to know what size life is right for them.Not so with me.  I was very impressionable as a young adult.  Looking back my desires and goals were often formed from those around me.  I believe the biggest influence in my early 20s came from my future mother-in-law.They say first impressions are the most lasting.  Certainly it was so with her.  Her small two bedroom apartment looked like a gift shop. Decorative objects filled every flat surface and wall.  Weekends were spent keeping artful displays dusted, polished and organized. Yearly, she would hand wash all the walls and ceilings, and every year she would get down on her knees and scrape off all the weekly layers of \"Wash and Glow\" (one step wash and wax solution) from all the floors with a paint scraper.  She would then apply a new layer of \"Wash and Glow\" to her floors and the cycle would begin again.    During this time she would rearrange all her furniture and decorations.  Her drawers and closets were perfection.  Nothing gave her greater joy than having someone comment on what a lovely home she had.  In hindsight, sadly, it is evident that her home reflected her worth in her eyes. In those first years, I admired all that.  Coming from a lower middle class family that did not have any disposable income, her apartment and style of living made a big impression on me.  My dysfunctional family was the opposite of everything she was.  I didn't see the negative life experiences and disappointments that lead her to such a controlled way of living.  I wanted to \"right size\" my life to reflect what I saw in her.  And in many ways I did.I came to understand, however, that her obsessive focus was on objects - not people.  Objects didn't disappoint - and people did.  As she aged her social contacts became limited.  Her \"friends\" were her hairdresser, the grocery store checker, the taxi cab driver.  Now I know that those folks could easily be discarded if they disappointed.   She had right sized her life to one narrow little path to minimize disappointment.Those early influences lingered on in me for years and years.  Eventually I learned to love and accept this woman for who she was while growing to understand that her \"right size\" was not right for me.  She was a wonderful grandmother to my children.  She died almost 20 years ago and I miss her to this day.  But her life style influence has almost totally faded from my radar.  It took about 40 years, but my own style is evolving in an entirely different direction.Right sizing my life kicked into high gear when mom died.  I am reaching what is good for me.  The size of our house may continue to be too big, but the contents are reaching a level that is manageable and comfortable."},
{"title": "My Life List - Memorial Day Weekend 2016", "date": "Sunday, May 29, 2016", "text": "My Life ListI am joining the blog Smidgens, Snippets and Bits in sharing \"My Life List.\"My Life List Currently: I am thankful ...... on this Memorial Day for the citizens who gave their lives in service to our country.  My earnest wish is that we can live in a world where there is no need to memorialize deceased military citizens because the world will be at peace.  Human beings being what they are, I am sure not even my great grandchildren will live long enough to see that day.Looking out my front window ...... I see well maintained green spaces and terraces.  I live on a small hill that separates us from the street.  It was the distance from the street that attracted me to this location.  Townhouse developments are typically uninteresting, cookie-cutter communities that resemble each other.  Frequently they have tiny front yards that hug a parking lot.  The developer of this community created an appealing space at the entrance where some of the town homes are up off the street allowing some sense of privacy and style.  The original landscape has matured.  After so long a time I hardly even notice its inviting beauty until someone else comments how lovely the setting is.  I'll miss this view when we leave.As I ponder ....... the Memorial Day holiday and this political season I can't help but wonder how our country got to such a dysfunctional place. I try to avoid taking public positions on political and religious views.  No one's deepest beliefs are changed by raging discussions of these topics.  But I am so uneasy at the national trends right now, I feel the need to express a worrisome opinion somewhere.  My blog ... my space .... my opinion.I am a registered Independent.  I have supported both Democratic and Republican candidates over my voting history.  One party never has all the answers.  But we are so divided as citizens now, and I believe that this division is reflected in the leadership we elected ... polarizing us even more.  Setting aside policy differences, when we cannot even replace a Supreme Court Justice using the rules our nation lives by - our Constitution - we are in a very sad state.I believe current candidates are the most diverse (and one is just plain frightening) choices for President in our history.  Sadly no candidate shows the leadership potential to pull us away from our derisive path.  I admit to being a big supporter of President Obama ... not because I agree with all his policies, but because he is an educated, even-tempered, thoughtful man who has served with grace under incredible pressure.  If a person of his quality could not bring us to more national unity and understanding, the current batch of candidates most certainly will make things worse.When the nations of the world look at our struggles to pick a leader ... a leader who historically is the leader of the free world ... I am sure they cringe.  What has happened to America?  Are we going through a \"terrible twos\" period in our history, or a mid-life crisis, or are we in decline as the voice of reason in a crazy dangerous world?I hope we are in a momentary \"blip\" in our history.  That calmer more reasonable minds will prevail and we return to a better sensibility of who are ... and behave accordingly!  (I am such a polly-anna!) What I am learning ...... I am learning to keep my mouth shut about this political stuff on Facebook. What I am reading ... This Bitter Treasure by S. W. Hubbard.   This is the 3rd book in the Palmyrton Estate Sale Mystery Series.  The lead character, Audrey Neaton, is the owner of an Estate Sale company.  The mysteries revolve around that various estate sales she coordinates.  There is always a mystery and there is a bit of romance but the theme that attracts me is the estate sale business.  Great fun!What I am creating ....Besides an ulcer :-) ...  I am still working two shawls.Discovery time ....I bought two new items this week.  During a period when I am not buying much of anything, I was kind of surprised by these purchases.The More of Less: Finding the Life You Want Under Everything You Own by Joshua Becker.  I obviously have a weakness for reading non-fiction books on this topic. Rated on Amazon as 4.8 stars out of 5, I couldn't seem to pass this up.  I usually buy Kindle editions because they are cheaper and don't take up space, but for this title, the Kindle was more expensive.  I probably will pass the book on when I am done.  My designated shelf for books is full and I am not going to allow it to spill over.The Handbag of Holding -  Ok, this was a fun impulse purchase.  I will admit to a bit of a tote bag obsession.  I always have a knitting project or two, plus my Kindle and my iPad with me.  I am always on the search for interesting and functional totes.  This bag is the latest in that search.  The origins of this bag and name are found specifically in the fantasy game Dungeons and Dragons (D and D).  A \"bag of holding\" is described as a \"wondrous item\" used by gamers to hold a great number of items that would normally be to big or to heavy for the bag or a person to carry.  It is \"a bag that has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions and can hold up to 500 pounds.  The bag weighs about 15 pounds regardless of its contents.\"  See?  Wonderous!  Anyway, I came across The Handbag of Holding on Amazon.  It is a tote designed to hold a lot in an organized fashion and its zipper pulls are 20 sided dice (another game reference.)  It has a handsome tailored look, and I love the game reference.  I used to play D and D with a group - and my husband and son still play monthly with same group of individuals for over 35 years.  Feel free to check out the Amazon links.What I am watching ...I finished watching House of Cards and am now struggling to find another highly rated series to follow.  I have sort of run out of titles.  Any suggestions? I started a TV series call Grace and Frankie.  The actors are Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen - all actors I enjoy.  Briefly, it is a comedy about two women finding out that their husbands are not just work partners, but have also been romantically involved for the last 20 years.  The wives have a strained relationship already and coping with this news doesn't make things better.  I have seen the first two episodes and I am not entirely sold on it, but it has multiple seasons and is highly rated so I will give it a few more episodes before I decide.  Sometimes these things grow on you.What's on my camera phone ...The beautiful lady is my daughter, Kristin with her dog, Milo.  This picture is one of the professionalshots taken for sales promotions where my daughter works.She is the Director of Sales at a Retirement Continuing Care Community in DCand Milo is considered \"part of the sales team.\"  Folks love seeingthat pets are part of the life in a senior community so it is not an idle title for Milo. He is not on the payroll, but he pulls is weight. :-)A quote I want to share ...Some things in life cannot be fixed.  They can only be carried.  Megan DevineIn my experience most things can't be fixed.  They must be carried.  And the load of carried items just keeps getting heavier as the years pass.  I think that is why people get shorter as they get older - the weight of life gets heavy.  :-)  Well, that is my story, and I am sticking to it.A peek into my week ...It is the end of one month and the start of another.  I feel the pull to start initiate and/or re-commit to things at the beginning of a month.  I plan to focus on these 3 things:With the downsizing efforts reduced, I have time to finally get my photo albums and loose pictures organized.  I am also hoping to do some journaling in the finished albums - adding thoughts and remembrances in and around the mounted pictures. Nothing fancy - no scrap booking or artistic endeavors - just a way to make the parade of photos more interesting and maybe more meaningful to someone else should they show an interest.    Increase my step totals beyond the 7,000 average I do now.  Goal remains 10,000 steps a day.Be more consistent in my stretching routine.A peaceful Memorial Day to you!Remember what all those soldiers died for.Make your citizenship count in a positive way."},
{"title": "Authenticity Shawl", "date": "Saturday, May 28, 2016", "text": "The second shawl I am working on is called Authenticity.  The first picture shows the finished project as shown on the pattern.  This is another pattern that can be made bigger by repeating the 16 line pattern any number of times or by adding to the garter trim.  I plan on making this one a bit bigger as well.  The yarn I am using is Berroco Lustra is which is 50% wool and 50% tencel.  As a result it has a shiny appearance.  The picture below is closer to the true color of the yarn than the succeeding pictures.  But even so, the gray threads in the picture below seem to be 50% of the color - when they are not.  It has a more deep purple pink look to it.  Maybe when the shawl is done, I can take a picture of it out doors in natural light.The picture below is provided just for comparison - they don't look at all the same when they are exactly the same ball of yarn.  Lighting is so important when trying to capture color.  I hardly ever get it right.Here is my progress knitting Authenticity.  As you can see, it will require very strong blocking to bring out the pattern.  Also, this pattern is not the most difficult lace pattern I have ever done, but it does need your attention while knitting.  I am always counting the different sections to make sure I have the right number of stitches before beginning the next row.  I try to be so careful, but mistakes happen more frequently than I would like.  So far I have caught them at an early stage.  I will be very glad to get to the lower garter boarder where I can relax and to worry about counting sections."},
{"title": "Hitchhiker Shawlette", "date": "Friday, May 27, 2016", "text": "As mentioned in a previous post ... I am working on two shawls.  This first shawl is an asymmetrical  shawlette.  The yarn used was a Socks that Rock medium weight.  The dyer has a tendency to create yarns with bold large shifts in color.  The dying technique can cause pooling of colors (large areas where a single color can collect together resulting in uneven or badly placed blotches.)  Finding the right pattern for these Socks that Rock yarns is important if you want to avoid unintentional pooling.  Also interesting to note is that when the yarn is in the skein it looks different from when wound into a ball.  The two yarns above looked exactly the same before I put one into a ball.  They look so different to my eye.The pattern I used is called Hithhiker.  The designer's picture is a smaller version.  This shawlette can be made bigger just by continuing to knit until you decide to stop.  My version is generally bigger.  This pattern has the advantage that you can work on it without paying much attention.  You knit every row (known by knitters as garter stitch) and the instructions for the points are very simple.    Generally I like to have a project that requires little or no attention while I knit so I can watch TV or carry on a conversation with friends and not worry about making mistakes that require major ripping out to fix.Once completed this seldom needs blocking.  The garter stitch lies beautifully flat and needs no massaging through blocking to look \"finished.\"  Most knitted garments need gentle blocking and some shawls required excessive blocking to bring out the pattern and provide a finished look.  Not so with this pattern.I think this is my 4th Hitchhiker. Next up - a traditional shawl."},

Something about having our house shown in a brochure made the emotion of leaving this place suddenly rise to the surface.  I responded, that I would try not to cry when he created that brochure.  He glanced at me and paused for a moment.  He then gracefully shifted his gaze and commented that a move like this after 30 years is hard - so much life has occurred here - and your obvious care of the property shows just how hard it will be. I could feel my eyes tearing up and my throat tighten.  I couldn't speak.He quickly went on to describe the house he and his wife had lived in and had 6 kids in - 1100 square foot rancher.  He talked about how it felt to keep that house, but rent it to strangers.  That his son still cuts the grass for that property.  That he only rented to those he trusted, but still had attachments.  And so on and so on.While he talked I had a chance to get control of my emotions.  I was grateful.We moved on.Oh my God.  This won't be easy.  How will I ever get through the settlement process!"},
{"title": "Sliding towards less", "date": "Wednesday, May 25, 2016", "text": "While I am not qualified to speak on the topic of minimalism,  it does feel like I am slipping towards a \"less\" style of living. Setting aside the downsizing efforts needed to move, getting less stuff off my radar always makes me feel better.  I've done this many times, but not so drastically as this time.For the most part, I can't remember the bulk of what I have carried out the door.  Obviously if I can't remember that mountain of stuff, it was not important.  It was taking up space in my world and robbing my attention and energy.But the remembered list of discarded things is considerable AND remarkable for many reasons.  It totally astounds me how much we held onto - long beyond our interest in them.  Passions from 20 or 30 years ago that we lost interest in and just boxed away.  Hobbies and past times my husband could no longer enjoy because he could not see.  Sentimental items that lingered because we could not let go of the emotion attached to them.  Valuable items we never touched much less saw for years and years.Here is a brain dump of the remembered stuff that is living with new owners.Doll house and all the doll house furniture - this all went back to the original owner, my daughter and pictures of that lovely hobby were featured here. It is the one thing if she simply didn't want it any more, I would take back.Stamp Collection -  valued at over $80,000 at one time.Huge board game collectionVast library of books - near a thousand at one point when my husband could readMiniature hand painted soldiers - over 300 miniatures, many were museum qualityThemed chess sets - 10 or 11 in allGerman imported nut crackers - 22 in allFurniture - 2 chests of drawers, 2 benches, a full size freezer, 2 desks, a head board - that was just in the last 3 months - many more pieces in the last year.Kitchen stuff - mugs, good china, Kitchen aide food processor, about 40 cookbooks (a ridiculous number for a person who doesn't want or like to cook) Crafts - spinning wheel, yarn, about 25 books, yarnMy work clothes are gone, boxes and boxes of shoes are gone - mostly because my sad old feet can wear only about 3 pairs without pain.That list makes me a little breathless.  The money we spent.  Yes, we did get enjoyment at the time but really ... the space and energy it subtracted from our lives over years exceeds the balance of enjoyment we got for a short time.  Too bad I can't send a message back to my younger self and say \"STOP!  You won't really care about this stuff for most of your life!\"  Well ... I still care about that doll house and my yarn, but everything else, not so much.And still stuff remains .... photo albums and pictures I will keep because they spark precious memories.  I still have a lot of clothes.  Guess I will need to check out condition and size.  Our pantry is shrinking ... the thought crossed my mind more than once over the years that I may be a food hoarder.  At least all the expired foods are gone :-) and I check the pantry before I shop.  Ha!  There is a roughed in closet with storage items (Christmas, lamps, picture frames, ladder, shovels, etc) that has yet to be explored.  I bet I have weed killer from 1999.  And my yarn room.  *sigh* I have given away some yarn to various folks and about half my pattern books.  I could still knit until I was 97 without buying even one skein of yarn and never run out.  Here there is no doubt ...  I am a card carrying hoarder of yarn.  I think I will happily hold on to that title until I take my last breath.Interestingly enough, ongoing stuff reduction seems to have unintentionally spilled over into other areas of my life. For example:I have long since given up a wide array of cosmetics, perfumes and lotions.  My approach to personal appearance is simple - this is me, the way God made me and life changed me.  My gray hair and wrinkles have been well earned. I wouldn't think of hiding them.  I am happy with myself the way I am.  All I really need is a blow drier and hair brush, moisturizer, lip gloss, a splash of blush, enough sleep to keep the circles from my eyes and a smile!  I hope all that counts as graceful aging instead of laziness.  Ha.I have never been a big jewelry person but I did have a few pieces that were special.  I gave away some to family, kept a few, but only wear my wedding ring now.  I don't even wear earings in my pierced ear lobes.  My, how times have changed.My personal schedule is much reduced.  I used to enjoy many social obligations and organized groups that used my talents.  I don't get the energy or enjoyment I used to from that busy schedule.  Now I limit myself to fewer external ongoing commitments and look forward them more because they are not squeezed into an over committed calendar.  I am happy with my own company, my family and close friends.  I don't seek out more just because I have time for more. Sliding towards less ...  a good thing."},
{"title": "My Life List", "date": "Monday, May 23, 2016", "text": "I follow the blog Smidgens, Snippets and Bits. I found Paula when she was a caregiver for her husband who has since passed away.  I was caring for my mom at the same time and my mom passed away several months after her husband.  She and I had a lot in common.She has a fun blog, and you should check her out.  One post she offers with regularity is a \"My Life List.\"    As I read through her recent list, I realized that my own responses to her prompts jump out of my mind too.  Although she started this practice as a link to A Simple Woman's Daybook blog, she decided to break away from that format.  Her own format is relaxed - no strict rules about entries or prompts, no linking to other blogs, just a way to share short bursts of your own life as it suits you.  I loved the idea of it and have decided to \"steal\" (translation - join) her idea.  Knowing Paula, it will make her smile.My Life List Currently: I am thankful ...... for the continued thread of connectivity and friendship I have with blog friends who have traveled with me since this blog was created in 2009.  So much has changed, so many hurdles leaped.  And yet, here we still are together.Looking out my window ...... I see green.  I am so fortunate to have a green back drop to my townhouse.  Yes, I have neighbors attached to me on either side, but when I look out my back windows it is like looking into a small forest of green.  Deer frequently visit that hill of green and you don't need binoculars to see them ... I am that close.  Sometimes they sit on that hill (they think they are hidden) and I can watch them.  Mom used to love that.  I will miss this view when I move.As I ponder ....... the next 15 years.  Yes, in only 15 years I will be 84.  Seems almost impossible, that so much time of my life is behind me and that I will be an old woman by anyone's definition in 15 short years.  I am not sure I would think about this next stage of life it I hadn't watched an elderly person walk through it while living in my home.  That realization is less a theory and more a reality once you have had the experience.  It is much like the young person at 25 who knows if they live long enough they will be a very very old person at 50, (ha), but really doesn't believe it so it is more theoretical - and yet as you get closer to 50 you start to believe it as reality (except 50 doesn't feel \"very very old.\")What I am learning ....... patience!  Patience, patience and more patience.  I thought I had learned all there was about patience in taking care of my mom, but I find the well of patience I still need to learn continues to grow in taking care of my husband with his increasing visual impairment.  Being his eyes is a daily - sometimes hourly - task.  I push back frequently in many small ways to encourage independence, but it is like pushing a boulder up hill.  And he is a person with little patience - has been all his life, so the frustration he feels is so great with this limitation - and the sorrow I feel knowing this sometimes brings tears to my eyes.  In writing this, I realize that maybe what I need to be doing is teaching him patience.  Hmmm ....What I am reading ...I am almost always \"reading\" two books.I am listening to The Sound of Glass by Karen White.I am reading on my Kindle Treasure of Darkness by S. W. HubbardWhat I am creating ....I am working on two shawls.  Pictures to follow in another post.  All my other fiber projects are packed away so that the house looks tidy and uncluttered for a potential sale.What I am watching ...Season four of House of Cards - Oh, my God, these people are so despicable.  And I wonder at myself that I can't stop watching that show.  Ha!What's on my camera phone ...I have been helping my husband to set up a new iMac computer.   In doing that I took two pictures of our personal wall paper from the old iMac.  The first picture is my wall paper of a flower filled with color and shades of pink.  The second picture is my husbands wall paper.  Color has no meaning for him.  He needs contrast and bold lines - and with these changes he can see only parts.  We can't look through his eyes, but these images sort of demonstrates the scope of what he dealing with.  These pictures make me sad.A quote I want to share ...One day she finally grasped that unexpected things were always going to happen in her life.  And with that she realized the only control she had was how she chose to handle them.  So she made a decision to survive using courage, humor and grace.  She was the Queen of her own life and the choice was hers!   Luputha HerminI have a ways to go before I am using courage, humor and grace.A peek into my week ...This week we meet with our new real-estate agent for a final walk through of our property, to get a final punch list of changes needed so we are ready to sell this property if something shows up on the market for us to buy.  We will also sign the contract with him.  And my regular schedule of dogs visits starts up again mostly because the puppy needs a break mid-day to peep and have his lunch. Word of the year update ... Move!Well, my word for the year is \"move\" and I guess it still fits.  I planned it to mean keep my body moving.  Turns out it is more like \"move\" all your worldly possessions somewhere else!  Yikes.  How did that happen.  My \"move\" exercise efforts are still struggling.  By the time I get done with my \"move\" all your worldly possessions efforts, I am bushed.  I guess moving is moving regardless of how it happens.  But now that my downsizing efforts have slowed, my exercise efforts need to pick up.Well, there you have it!  I think it is a fun exercise and it hits the high (and low) points of my life today.  Enjoy."},
{"title": "The Finish Line", "date": "Wednesday, May 18, 2016", "text": "I have finally gotten our worldly goods down to the basics for living in our townhouses.  Trips to the dump and to Good Will have slowed.  Yesterday several pieces of furniture where picked up and hauled away.  Oh, there are still some small pockets of stuff I haven't finished getting through. But we are close.  If were were to move now, of course, I am sure other things would not come with us because space in a two bedroom condo will be more limited.But ... where to go.  That question still haunts us.Our search continues to limit us to elevator buildings or first floor units.  We are further limited by location and condition.   Not all locations are acceptable for a variety of reasons.  But the issue of condition (how well maintained, how clean, appliance issues, etc. etc. etc.) still remains a large stumbling block for me. We are looking for a 'move-in-ready' property.  My definition of move-in-ready, means that I can move in and not be faced with major condition expenses in the first year.  Our house will be move-in-ready by my definition.  In fact, it would be several years before someone would need to take action on anything ... unless they simply want to change the paint color, upgrade my new kitchen counters or purchase other appliances in a different color.  I personally find those kinds of changes wasteful if the item functions well and is clean.  But I understand about differences in taste.  Some \"move in ready\" places, however,  the appliances are so old and so dirty (and some have external damage) ... they would need to be replaced before I moved in.I don't want people to think I am a persnickety housekeeper.  My appliances are not always clean, for years I lived with clutter, some of my carpet is original, and many dust bunnys use this place as a postal address.  But if I sell this townhouse, those short comings will not be someone else's problem.  I'll take care of them before I show this house to perspective buyers.In the two and a half months of condo searching ... and visiting a few properties that came close to what we were looking for, only two condos hit the market that were perfect and they were right in my neighborhood.  Two units out of hundreds.  They got snapped up quickly.So my husband and I have started to qualify every moving conversation with the possibility that we will stay here.  It would mean some major expenses to retro-fit this townhouse to be user friendly for seniors.  Two stair lifts would be a very expensive addition to a house that is too big for us now.   When you live in a 3 level town house and each level has things you use in daily living - it adds up to two stair lifts.  But it is an option down the road.Fall is the 'finish line' for us on moving.  We can continue to live with uncertainty for that long.  We can continue to expend the energy that is required on multiple levels to make a move happen until we reach the finish line.   At the finish line, we will be in another abode ... or not!  Either way, we are ok with it (cause I am not doing this again next year.)We are lucky that either choice is a good one."},
{"title": "One step back ...", "date": "Friday, May 6, 2016", "text": "This week we decided to change real-estate agents!  Not that we had signed agreement yet with anyone, but we had been working off and on with one man from last fall  ...  more off than on!!We met with another agent from a different real-estate company who was recommended by my son.  During our first meeting I felt more at ease about our decision to sell and move than I had during the last 10 months.  I can't tell you what made the actual difference between the two agents, except to say that this new agent is focused on the general real-estate market - which we are stepping into with trepidation - and the other guy was focus on the 55+ senior market which we had decided against.Maybe all the stars just aligned in the sky at the right time. Whatever the reason, we changed agents this week.I will tell you this ... doing this whole process without an agent would make my head explode!  I can't believe all the little twists and turns you go through to make a move like this. It is always making trade offs, deal making, massaging the numbers, exploring different options ... it is exhausting and stress filled stuff.  Why can't selling and buying real-estate be like buy a bathing suit.  You go into the store, look at all the bathing suites on the rack, pick a size and color, try one on, you pick a bigger size (nuts), try on another one, you look for something that covers more of you, (decide you really must lose weight sometime soon - or stop using mirrors), you take it to the check out and pay for it.  Then you can walk out of the store and put it on right away (ok, you find a private place to put it on right away so you don't get arrested.)  Woo hoo!  Done!Ok, buying a bathing suit is almost as hard as buying real-estate.*Sigh*  This is bringing the crazy out in me!Best to have the right agent so I won't go crazy.Or should I say ...  go more crazy than I already am!  :-)"},

{"title": "Progress ... to a brick wall?", "date": "Friday, April 29, 2016", "text": "The moving saga continues.  It progresses to a point that may hit a brick wall.The last few days I took a break from all this effort.  I was too tired to continue. I really need to pace myself now.  My energy levels are not inexhaustible.  Such a sad observation of an older body.  But it confirms the need to make some life adjustments during this year. The real problem so far has been the lack of properties that fit our needs.  Oh yes, there are bunches out there, more and more every day.  And that is encouraging.  But I know we cannot move into a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom condo that has only 800 to 950 square feet.  I have seen a few.  We need about 1,000 square feet.  And many condos use that limited space very poorly.  They are filled with walls and hallways - instead of maximizing the limited space with an open style floor plan.  It is amazing how many advertise an \"open floor\" plan and when you see it, the walls seem to close you in.Then there is the problem of condition.  Neither my husband or I are handy.  We won't move from a townhouse that really is \"move in ready\" and start over in a condo that was listed as \"move in ready\" and isn't.  One property needed all new appliances and painting throughout.  All the closet doors would need to be replaced.  And, of course, the biggest hinderance, no access by wheel chair or walker should we need it in the future.  I could not face repeating all the work we did here - to make another place right for us.  If it was a hobby or a talent of mine, maybe, but it isn't.  And that kind of updating requires money when you hire someone to do it for you.No matter ... something may show up.  It is only April.  We have searched for only a month.  We are early in this process.  But it sure is tiring and challenging.The downsizing and cleaning continues.  Collection of packing materials continues.  A few boxes have been packed.  The house continues to feel less and less filled - even if only to our eyes.  It has been a freeing process.  One I wish I had done earlier.But the condo market in our area just isn't cooperating yet.Although my husband cannot help with any of these efforts ... we have settled together on a plan of action.Our plan looks something like this ...Continue the clean out and downsize efforts until we reach the point that the remaining stuff is what we use all the time and love.  Continue to look at condos with the eye to move in 2016.When we find a property we are interested in, then put our townhouse on the market to sell.  This approach is chancy because it assumes that the condo seller will wait while we sell our townhouse.  It is possible.  We both agree, however, we don't want to be pushed into buying something else quick (maybe making a bad decision) because we have a buyer for our place waiting in the wings. Come October, if we have not moved, we may wind up settling in place making adjustments to this property to make it almost do-able.  Those adjustments include things like stair lifts and hiring cleaning help.  Certainly this is a fall back position - and not ideal on many levels.  But re-settling in a condo that doesn't fit our needs either is not ideal.  On the upside the townhouse and our contents would be in total move-ready condition should something change unexpectedly.Right now, I think that is the best we can do."},

My brain seems to have trouble shutting off and taking a break to sleep. Of course sleep and I haven't been all that fast friends since I entered my 60s.  And I regularly use non prescription sleep aids to get my eyes to close at bedtime.  The problem is keeping them closed.  Hence the 'joyful' welcome of the morning.  Truly, if I open my eyes and the clock says 5:30 am ... I count that as a full night sleep even if I closed my eyes at midnight.  If the clock says 2:00 am, I have a serious talk with my wide awake brain as I lay there in bed willing sleep to come.  Usually by 4:00 am I win the war and sleep comes.And yet, around 2:00 in the afternoon, I can't seem to keep my eyes open.  If I sit, the body takes that as a signal to relax and the eyes quickly follow.  Seldom do I actually sleep then either.  I rest.My mom used to call this position 'just resting her eyes.'  I get it now mom, I get it!  Too bad she is not here in person to see that I get it.And maybe this all has nothing to do with the stress of moving.  Maybe this has more to do with facing my 70s.Maybe that aging brain I talked about a few posts back is just the tip of the iceberg of everything slowing down.Well ... so much for wool gathering!  No time to dither.  Need to keep moving and packing and pitching!  The clock is ticking.  Too much to do to sit and watch it tick."},
{"title": "The Oven Conveys with the House.", "date": "Wednesday, April 20, 2016", "text": "Today I cleaned the oven.Ok, ok, I have a self-cleaning oven, and it cleaned it self ... but when you clean your oven only every 4 or 5 years, it is a big frick'en deal.  So I take credit for hitting the self clean button and thinking, \"Oh good, it still works.\"It was a lovely day today, so I had all the windows open.  Why is that important?  You will understand shortly.I am getting ready to sell this house and the oven conveys with the sale of the house, so it was time to clean the oven.  I mean, after all, when I start looking at other properties to buy I will certainly open the oven to see if it is clean!  :-)   You would do that right?? So my oven needed to be clean in case someone like me looks!But I am so much better at this than I used to be.Several years ago - well, maybe more than several years - like maybe 25 years ago, I remember deciding to clean my dirty oven.  It was a self-cleaning model then too.   The oven was very dirty.  Not just stained with cooked on stuff on the sides, but bunches of clumps of crusty whatever clustered on the bottom of the oven.  Yes, that bad. Time to do the deed.  I locked the oven door and hit the self clean button.  I smugly enjoyed the ease of this 20th century feature while my oven started its clean cycle.  I remember thinking that I was a modern 20th century wife and mother.  I didn't need to do this distasteful task myself.  With the flick of a finger, I was cleaning my oven.Oh, did I mention it was January?  Did I mention is was about 35 degrees outside?  Well, it was. That's important to know.Anyway, now the oven was cleaning. Then the oven began to smoke.  Smoke started to creep out of the stove vents.  Not a lot but enough to be alarming.  The smoke detector sensed the smoke and it began to chirp ... ok, scream.  Yikes!  I tried to turn the oven off.  The oven ignored my efforts.   It was locked in its clean cycle, the heat was at hellish levels, and it was doing what I was asked it to do.  No stopping it now.  Crap!I tried to turn the smoke detector off and realized I didn't know how to turn it off.  Great!  My eyes began to burn a bit, and although the smoke level was minimal ... (how do you judge \"minimal\" smoke in your house?) ... the smell was getting intense.  I started to cough.  I decided to turn off the house heat and open all the windows.  I had young children in the house, after all.  We needed to breath!!Oh, and did I mention it was January and it was 35 degrees outside?  Well, it was.So then the house began to get cold (but the air quality got better ... I am a \"glass is half full kind of person.\")  But we were getting really cold.  So we all put on our coats and sat at the kitchen table huddled together waiting for the oven to do its thing.  For 3 hours!!Oh, and I also stepped down off my 20th Century modern woman pedestal long enough to figured out how to stop the blaring smoke alarm.It was not my finest hour.So this week (mid April) when I pushed the self cleaning button of my oven, the day was beautiful,  the temp was about 65 degrees, my windows were open AND I cleaned out the crust at the bottom of my oven in advance (Very.Very.Important) We still had some odor.  My husband complained about the smell in the house and I cautioned him that things could be worse ... it could be 30 degrees outside, the smoke alarm could be screaming and he would need to wear his coat. He had NO IDEA what I was talking about.  See 25 years ago he was at work when I last covered myself in glory with my skillful oven cleaning efforts.  I am so much improved now! :-)Don't go looking for the 'before' picture.  There isn't one.I have no intention of leaving proof behind of my house keeping  short comings.:-)Anyway, the oven is now sparkling clean.  Now we can move."},
{"title": "Where to go ...", "date": "Tuesday, April 19, 2016", "text": "The big question is ... Where!!Where are we to go?I have given this some thought.  If you know me personally, you know I love lists.  Here is my list of criteria for our search - in pretty much the order of importance:Stay in Howard County where there is an excellent hospital, ideally stay in the city of Columbia where we have lived for 43 years, and if all the stars align correctly, remain in our current neighborhood where we have lived for 31 years.  Guess you could say we have history here. :-)  Thankfully we have two lovely condo developments close to us that fall comfortably within bullet #1.Buy down - meaning, buy at about 80% or less of the current value of our town house.  Although that narrows our choices,  there are options in that range.Two bedrooms and two bathrooms.  At a minimum a full and a half bath - 2 toilets!  At our age, waiting to use the toilet is not realistic - at least not without a change of pants (ha!).  Just say'en.No interior steps.  It is amazing how many units have steps within the condo.  We might have to take 5 or 6 steps to get to our front door, but lack of steps inside the condo is non-negotiable.  After living with 49 steps in total, I think we can do 6 to the front door.Square footage should be between 1000-1200 square feet.  If I was single, I could go smaller, but two people need more space - especially two people who have been married for 47 years.  If you have been married that long you know exactly what I am talking about!  Walking distance to a grocery store.  Most couples share driving duties.  There is a main driver and a back up driver.  Well, our main driver, my husband, stopped driving 10 years ago - and our back up driver, me,  is getting older by the minute.  Just to be safe, close access to basic necessities is important.No top floor condos for me - even if there is an elevator.  I'd like to think I could jump from a burning building and have a chance of surviving.  :-) Meant as a joke, but at the same time I am very serious.  So a second or third floor condo is preferred.  An elevator building is required for a third floor condo.I am on the fence in getting a first floor condo - but I am trying to keep an open mind.  I live in a city, a safe city mostly, but crime happens even in safe places.I am not interested in a  55+ plus community.  I enjoy living around a variety of people of different ages and backgrounds.  Besides, those 55+ communities are more expensive than we can afford.And finally, no condo fixer-uppers!  My husband and I are degrading into fixer-uppers.  We don't have to live in one!So that is my top 10.   Will I get all 10?  Chances are against it.I have spent considerable  time checking out online properties.  The real-estate  listings today are wonderful because they provide pictures and details without ever leaving your living room.  That search has resulted in exactly one property that meets all 10 criteria.  Only one out of hundreds.  Amazing.  I must be too picky.  Of course every day is a new day in the real-estate world.  Who knows that will be listed tomorrow.Next week we will see the one condo that fits our needs ... if it is still available! Oh ... and today is my birthday!!  Happy Birthday to me.  Guess I will find out who actually reads to the end of my wordy contributions to the blog-sphere!  Ha!"},
{"title": "The Big Pitch to Small Living", "date": "Monday, April 18, 2016", "text": "I am not talking baseball.I am talking clutter, downsizing, shrinking.  I am talking giving away stuff to friends and family, trips to the dump and donations to charity organizations.Over 7 years of blogging, I've written 28 posts about clutter.  Clearly this topic is important for me.  And it is breath taking (and embarrassing) to think of all the items that have passed through my hands over the years.  You can't inherit 3 households (small households for sure), and not have a mega highway of stuff running through you life.  Let's not forget my husband and I also contributed generously to that collection of stuff.Some people downsize to the point that living in a smaller space comfortably is possible.  That is our goal.  But smaller can translate into tiny for some.  That is not our goal.  I have been, however, very curious about the tiny house movement.  The true tiny house runs about 120-220 square feet of space.  It is fascinating to see those small spaces and how inventive folks need to be to live in them.  I wouldn't live in one myself but it is fun to explore that option through the lives of others.  Of course, when you live in 2200 square feet of space like I have done for 31 years, stuff grows to fit the void.  Getting to smaller living is hard when you live in a bigger than average structure.That is about to change for me.Less stuff and less square footage.Our goal is to shrink from 2200 square feet to pretty much half or 1100 square feet.  Not exactly a \"tiny\" house, but it will qualify in my mind as smaller living.And to get to that goal, the \"big pitch\" is underway.  This time it is not just stuff at risk... furniture is also getting the boot.I always find this effort to be so rewarding.  As I pare down my belongings, I feel lighter, more in control, and in a strange way - very appreciative of the stuff that makes the cut.  It is like seeing 'the keepers' with more clarity remembering why I loved that item to begin with.  Truly, too much stuff seems to distract me from what I really care for.I have made pretty good inroads in cleaning out stuff, but much remains to be done.  I am so grateful that I did so many decluttering sessions in the years before this one.  I can't imagine how hard this would be if I had a house that was literally stuffed to the rafters.A month ago I gave away a full size spinning wheel that I purchased 7 years ago - during a time when I was coping with stress by buying stuff.  When I think of spinning I am drawn to spinning on a spindle.  Spinning yarn is in my future - just not on a wheel.  My spinning wheel was a gift to my cousin - and she and Agatha (yes, the wheel's name is Agatha), are spinning away joyfully together.  Never have I had so much fun sharing of my belongings as that gift to my cousin.Yesterday I gave away a collectable bear dressed in a Marine Corp dress uniform.  It was a pricey bear I purchased when my son entered the Marine Corp.  It when to a family with a new born boy - the father was a Marine.  The perfect home for my Marine Corp bear! (Wish I kept a picture of him for this post.)Today I gave away my Kitchen Aide Food Processor.  God knows that I was thinking when I bought that.  I cook only to eat - certainly not out of enjoyment - and that kitchen gadget was pricey.  It is not going with us.Tomorrow we are having a \"give away\" for friends.  My husband and I collected Chess Sets for many years.  Our kitchen table is stacked with them.  We kept a special few - maybe 3.  I really love those 3.  But the others, all beautiful and unique, will find new homes soon I hope.I am not sorrowful or pensive about any of these departing items.  In fact I can't even remember most  the stuff that I carried out of this house in the years preceding today.  Its been freeing and fun. I am excited about this move to less and smaller.  Yes, it is being forced on me by circumstance, and the steps needed to get their are tiring and scary, but the end result will be positive!"},
{"title": "Here", "date": "Sunday, April 17, 2016", "text": "Sadness creeps in when I think about leaving this townhouse.  I miss this place already and I haven't even left it yet. Growing up I never lived in a home we owned.  I was raised in rental properties and we move a few times before I got married.  As a married woman we moved a few times before settling here.   There was no place that had roots for me ... until here.I've lived 31 of my 69 years in this spot.  My roots here are deep.  It has been sort of my silent partner through some of the toughest and happiest years of my life.  It has been a good place to live.I raised a family here.I supported two elderly relatives through their last years here.I offered shelter to my adult children more than once here.I watched my mother sit on the front porch for hours here.I mourned the passing of my mom here.I watched my mother-in-law suffer and die here.I watched my husband lose his vision here.I mourned the loss of 7 cats here.I watched my son leave for the military here.I worried every year he was in service here.I watched my daughter struggle with the downs of job loss here.I watched my son leave this house on his wedding day to start a new life here.I welcomed friends and family through many many holidays here.I welcomed a new daughter-in-law into our family here.I snuggled and loved (beyond all reason) grand dogs here.I struggled with my own demons in a demanding job here.Here ...the place I am preparing to sell because it no longersupports my life in a safe and comfortable way.I try to remember how lucky I have been to experience home ownership.  Much of the world doesn't have more than a hovel to call home.  I remind myself that when I am long gone from this earth this townhouse will still be here, sheltering another family I hope.  I instruct my silly self to focus on the fact this townhouse is an inanimate object, a structure - not a living being and my attachment is maybe a little bazaar.   All those life experiences live vibrantly in my mind only.I know all that.But I can't help the feeling that a major portion of my life experiences are embedded here - in the  walls, the air, the foundation.  And I can't box any of that up and take it with me.I hope I don't cry during settlement when I sign this place away to someone else and walk away ... this place I called home for 31 years. This place with my roots.How will they know how special 'here' is!"},
{"title": "Early Stages", "date": "Saturday, April 16, 2016", "text": "So what does this picture of boxes suggest to you?If you thought of 'moving,' you would be right!We are facing a move and we are in the very early stages of that enormous task.Long time readers know that I live in a 3 level town house with 2 full flights of stairs.  Those who followed the blog during the years my mother lived here know that I also have 20 common area steps to climb to reach my front door.  49 steps in all!  Some may also know that after 30 years of wonderful service to my family, this town house has gotten just too big.  Too big to heat and cool, too big to clean (3 1/2 bathrooms for 2 people is too many toilets to clean and does anyone really need 11 closets,) and too much in taxes and upkeep for retired folks on a limited income.I frequently hear things like - what a lovely setting, how well maintained, the neighborhood is great, and .... huh, just how many steps do you have?? Last year we began talking about moving.  But my husband and I were of two minds - so the topic was dropped.  This year, with me facing 69 and him facing 70, (yikes) the topic of downsizing brought us to the 'move' question again.   The realization that on this day we are as young as we are ever going to be was a big motivator to get serious.So the downsizing parade has begun.  Lists of furniture and objects that will not travel with us are underway, conversations with the realtor and our bank are in full swing, and packing has begun.  All very early stages, but started in earnest.And let me say this now ... it is exhausting and at times overwhelming. We should have done this years ago, but years ago I was exhausted and overwhelmed with caregiving.  The timing was never right for a move. So I plan to take you with me during this 'adventure' (nightmare.) Hold onto your hats!In closing - a personal observation about aging as it relates to change and big decisions (and this move is a big decision.)I learned through practical experience how the aging brain handles change.  Not well!  It looks very much like ... nothing.  No movement, no change to upset the status quo.  There is comfort and security in the known.  Lack of action makes a weird sense as time marks your body and mind.  Looking to conquer even small challenges is not on your radar.In early senior years the brain may continue to function well, but it is easy to slip into faulty thinking about the future.   \"I don't need to change anything.  Yes, this  isn't ideal but I can handle it now, and yes, I should be able to handle it for years to come.\"  And in a small percentage of the population that may be true.  But can you be sure you are in the small percentage.  Hard to know.I have seen the initial stages of faulty thinking in myself this year.  Last year I was 100% in favor of selling the townhouse and moving.  I saw the writing on the wall of our lives.  It was all plain as it could be.   We need to move.  I was 68 last year.This year I am 69 and the tiny web of resistance to change crept in.  Again I started to push for a move.  My husband started to see the logic of it, but I began to second guess myself.  There were days when I wondered is this the right thing to do.  After all, we are handling it now, how terrible would it be if we didn't change anything, yes, I know all these steps are not ideal for my disabled husband, but he has fallen only once on them.  We are doing just fine now.See what I mean?Next year I am 70 and who knows what I will be able to talk myself into not doing.The early stages ... the clock is ticking!More to come."},
{"title": "Why blog ... ", "date": "Friday, April 15, 2016", "text": "Oh my!  My last post was in January - expounding on the reaching the mid-winter point!  Here we are in April and not a word written in-between. Yes, I still live!  And shocking (to my mind), I have received a few inquiries ... where are you, are you returning to blog land?One of my blog friends, Paula, posted an interesting piece on March 5th called Where did they go?  She lamented about folks who stopped posting to their blog for 8 or 10 months, some as long as a year ... some never to return.  She missed the sharing of life experiences and wondered why they stopped.  That post sparked my thinking on those of us to disappear from blogging - for a time or forever.I guess it all comes down to why a person blogs in the first place.  I think we blog writers fall into 2 camps of people:those who write for themselves (they don't need an audience, they just need to get ideas out somewhere and the blog is a good place to plant them.)those who write for others (they write to educate, to sell, to explore ideas others, to generate conversation, to share a talent or hobby.)Some bloggers might say they slop over into both categories, but I fall entirely in the first category.  I write for me.  The need to write comes and goes as life changes.  I believe the first category is where most \"drop outs\" can be found because the \"need\" to blog wanes.  Life changes.For myself, it all started as a way to cope with my intense caregiving experience.  Eight years is a long time to step out of your normal life and give that energy to someone else.  My blog was a coping tool.  It was at times a life saver.After mom died, that coping mechanism seems less needed.  Moving on and sorting out how my life was now as well as adjusting to my own aging issues seemed uninteresting to write about.  Hence the periodic absences.Well, I am back again.  For how long I do not know.But I will tell you ... it hasn't been boring here in my corner of blog land.More on that to follow!"},
{"title": "Half Way ", "date": "Sunday, January 24, 2016", "text": "We are nearing the end of January - and in my mind - we are reaching the half way point in winter 2016.And what a winter it has been. I live in the Maryland - and this past weekend we had the worst winter snow storm in the history of the state - in my county we had 32 inches of snow over 2 1/2 days.  Crazy crazy weather, because just one month ago in December it was so warm I briefly thought of turning on the air-conditioning. We had days of warnings and predictions.  The reaction was also predictable.  HUGE runs on the food stores were reported.  Empty shelves, store staff struggling to keep up with the restocking and one story told of a person selling a loaf of bread on Facebook for $10.   Good grief.  You really only need enough food for your typical week - sometimes less.  But panic in this area hits even when one or two inches of snow are predicted.  When 2 feet are predicted, the mob reaction is breathtaking.  And then the storm arrives and you are trapped in your house.  We had strong winds, thunder, and very very cold temperatures to accompany all the feet of snow that got dumped on us.  I always think I am going to get soooo much done while nature does it's worst.  I will cook up a huge feast, I will knit tons of things, I will read several books and I will cuddle up on the couch with a dog.  I did cuddle with a dog wrapped in a blanket, but mostly I watched the storm rage outside - except for when I was out in it shoveling.  My grand dog has short legs.  Three feet of snow would be impossible for him.  So many many trips with the shovel were made so that I could manage the snow accumulation in smaller bites.  I also made sure the birds were fed on my back deck.  Food is what keeps them warm during these severe conditions.  And I watched a lot of TV.  The storm coverage was constant.  Images of stupid people who just had to get out in the storm - stuck in their totally ill equipped vehicle were common.  Really, those folks should be fined for obstructing roadways.  If they had to be somewhere due to the nature of their jobs,  they should arrive before the storm and plan to stay over. I survived the \"snow-ma-geddin\" of 2016!  And we didn't lose power - thankfully.  Today it was bright and sunny.  I am still shoveling, of course.  It will be another day before things are mostly normal. We are half way through winter and I am keeping my fingers crossed that Mother Nature has expended all her energy on this storm.  Please, let the rest of winter pass peacefully.  My back isn't as young as it used to be.Any big weather in your area?"},

But today a friend forwarded this piece of 'wisdom' to me - it is worthy of sharing.  I would love to give credit to the one who wrote it originally, but that information seldom follows with the text. Since my theme this year is 'Move', it seemed somewhat appropriate - except I plan to 'move' far more than this piece implies!Enjoy!God's Plan For Aging.Most seniors never get enough exercise.  In His wisdom God decreed that seniors become forgetful so the would have to search for their glasses, keys and other things thus doing more walking.  And God looked down and saw that it was good.Then God considered the function of bladders and decided seniors would have additional calls of nature requiring more trips to the bathroom, thus providing more exercise.  God looked down and saw that it was good.So if you find as you age, you are getting up and down more, remember it's God's will.  It is all in your best interest even though you mutter under your breath.Nine Important Facts to remember as we Grow Older (my personal favorite is #6)Death is the number 1 killer in the world.Life is sexually transmitted.Good health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can die.Men have 2 motivations: hunger and hanky panky, and they can't tell them apart.  If you see a gleam in his eyes, make him a sandwich.Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day.  Teach a person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks, months, maybe years.Health nuts are going to feel stupid someday, lying in the hospital, dying of nothing.All of us could take a lesson from the weather.  It pays no attention to criticism.In the 60's people took acid to make the world weird.  Now the world is weird, and people take Prozac to make it normal.Life is like a jar of jalapeño peppers.  What you do today may be a burning issue tomorrow.Don't ignore this message.  This is your only warning.Happy Thursday to you all!!"},
{"title": "A Word!", "date": "Wednesday, January 13, 2016", "text": "A common practice in blog-land (and other places I discovered) is to pick a single word to describe the intent or focus for the coming year. I have enjoyed reading some of these posts and recognized some repeating themes - especially if you have watched from the side lines for years like I have done.  Some popular ideas are Peace, Simplicity, Nourish, Downsize, Joy, Family, Organize, Love, and Happiness.Did I ever pick a \"word\" for myself?  Never.  I always thought it was a good idea, but I never seemed to have the energy to sum up my life for a year into a simple single thought - and keep that as my focus.But as I look back over the last decade - one word does seem to pop into my mind without any effort now.  It is more of an after thought, but very true. Survive.Funny, in all the years I watched others select a word for their coming year, never once did I read 'survive' as a word for the future.  I guess 'survive' mostly becomes evident after you do it.  And I did do it.  I survived a long caregiving experience despite some pretty significant set backs that had nothing to do with mom.  Sometimes you just don't know what you are capable of doing (and surviving) until you get through it.But what about 2016!You know ... I am thinking this is the year I just might pick a word.  When I started thinking about it around the New Year I bounced around all the typical words I had heard before.  Who doesn't want 'peace' in their lives?  And God knows, I have strived for 'simplicity' and 'downsize' for two years!  I am big on 'family.'  Family and eldercare ... well, that is like putting your money where your mouth is.  On and on, my brain rolled those words around and around.  Nothing seemed to fit this coming year.Then it came to me.  I have a word.  It fits perfectly with my current focus. I am 68 and I feel the weight of my accumulating years as well as the impact of past emotional stress.  I know that action always makes me feel better - even though I struggle with consistency in exercise.  My word should be an action word.  'Action' seems to slip out of the vocabulary of many older adults.  And from what I have seen, 'sedentary' is a killer.My 2016 word is:MOVEAll righty!  Got the word.  Now let's see just where it goes!  Or rather, just where I go!Do you have a word for 2016?I'd love to hear it if you do."},

I sincerely had no clue how many books was a reasonable number for me.  I frequently read or listen to books.  Listen more than read.  A few years ago I got a Kindle Paper White - and my actual reading dramatically increased, but still listening outranks reading.  I can listen to books while doing many other things.  But I never tracked how many books were completed.This year will be different.  And shockingly - today, January 9 - I have already finished 3 books.  I have two others in the works.  I suspect my guess-timate of how many books was reasonable is way way off.But I won't be changing my first estimate.  I will stick with 26 books for 2016 and see just how far off I am.  If I had to guess what my final total will be ... (you know, just between you and me - and not Good Reads), I will probably complete about 100 books this year.It will be fun to look back and see what the total actually turns out to be.Are you on Good Reads?  Are you doing a reading challenge this year?  If so, what is your goal for 2016?"},

Bathroom - with old style toilette in the foreground.About 10 years ago while my daughter was spending time at our house, she started to take an interest in the doll house.  She finished off the exterior by adding siding.  She repainted the roof tiles.  She added a few little interior pieces.  But her life got busy again and the doll house sat idle again.The foyer.I continued to keep it.  Maybe I would do something with it once I retired.  But my retirement years were filled with care giving.  No time or energy left for a doll house.  It remained in storage.The kitchen.There was never any though of getting rid of it.  The house was just in hibernation.This old time stove was a fairly expensive piece when we bought it in the late 1980s.But we all fell in love with it.  The various drawers open.  We even have copper pans for it.Last year during a major town house clean out,  I asked my daughter if she wanted her doll house.  I would still keep it if she didn't want it.  She did want it and her brother moved it to her condo in his vehicle because it is too big for a standard size car.The den.  The desk is a roll top desk.  The top actually closes.Since taking on full ownership, she has made many improvements.  She has rewired the electric, repainted, wall papered, and replaced a few small pieces of furniture that did not survive 25 years in storage.Attic boy's room.The blanket on the bed was made by my mother-in-law who died in 1997.The crocheting and yarn are not totally to scale for the furniture,but the item is priceless because it was made with love.It is a work in progress.  The pictures are missing many of the smaller items like dishes, the resident family, some pets, and household decorations - final refinements that can be added towards the end.Many of those items we already have. She has ordered new flooring and curtains. At some point rugs need to be ordered. And I wish my phone did a better job of handling the lighting. The sewing and spinning room.This room needs some skeins of yarn!!  I am glad the doll house is now with its rightful owner - being improved and valued - and for now it is adding a lovely interior decoration to her condo.  And someday this lovely house may be handed down to another family member to love and enjoy.A charming little spinning wheel.Note:  Updated pictures will be shared once the other major improvements are completed.Finally a light picture that is reasonable.Master BedroomCeiling Light"},
{"title": "Start the New Year Right!!", "date": "Friday, January 1, 2016", "text": "I am starting the New Year right. Meet my adorable grand dogs who fill so many of my retired hours.Grimace - my senior guy.Grimace inherited the role of \"King\" and elder statesman ofour canines after Meathead died.  Grimace never wanted to be King, butwe all have to do things we don't want to do sometimes.Dear, dear Grimace is my heart and soul.  All dogs have their unique inherited qualities.  Pugs are known most for being companion animals.  They are happy, cheerful, devoted, and, well ... stalkers.  I use the word \"stalkers\" in the most loving way.  Pugs MUST be at your side - even when you are planted on the toilet.  I know all dogs want to be with their owners, but Pugs value it at a level of importance equal to breathing.  No place is too horrible for them to follow you.  He has chosen his Grandma as his special person.  Grimace managed to squeak ahead of all the other pets in my heart  (including my own cats) through his blind devotion to me.  I think I am tied with his Papa, my son, in his heart.  He is an old guy now - about 13 years old.  He can't hear a thing and his vision is terribly compromised, but his heart is bigger than ever - and full of love.  Me too, dear Grimace.  Me too.  When your time comes to cross over the rainbow bridge to join your buddy Meathead, your Grandma's heart will be more than broken.  It will shatter into a million pieces.  Live a long long life my little buddy.Milo - who has Napoleon tendencies!Milo wanted to be 'king' from the moment he knew there was a 'king.'Wait your turn, Mr. Milo.Look at that cute face - how can you deny him anything!Ok dear Milo, I will give you France!Milo is a French Bull Dog.  That should explain EVERYTHING!  He is a handsome, affectionate, and cuddle bug who has delusions of grandeur and world domination - and who loves his mom (my daughter) above all others in the whole world.  Grandma is mom's back up and second in line.  French Bull Dogs are natural alert dogs. They alert you to all kinds of things.  Bad guys, good guys, delivery folks, kids playing outside, squirrels, leaves falling from the trees, a breeze.  There is no filter on that alert thing (barking) that they do. It is a busy life when you are a French Bull Dog.  He is at his best when he isn't sharing ... not sharing his toys ... not sharing his bones ... not sharing his peoples.  I know how you feel, dear Milo.  I am not a big sharer either.  Grandma loves your quirky little personality - and she wouldn't change one thing about you.  Well ... maybe you could be nicer to Grimace since he is the \"King\" now, but otherwise you are perfect.Olivia - or Livvy for short  (Sometime I call her 'girlfriend')She is a polite, sweet, sensitive lady dog with baggage left over from a previous life.Livvy is the latest addition to our family.  Olivia was rescued from a local no-kill shelter.  She was first adopted as a puppy by a shelter volunteer.  Two years into her 'forever home' her owner got cancer and died.  She was returned to the shelter after the adult children of the deceased owner determined they could not keep her.  She lived another month in the shelter until my daughter-in-law noticed her and recognized her worth.  At the time our family was recovering from the death of our beloved English Bull Dog, Meathead.  For Livvy and my daughter-in-law, it was love at first sight.  Livvy is a hound and Swiss Mountain Dog mix.  She is living proof that given enough time, patience and love, a shelter dog with a rocky start in life can make a sensational addition to the family.  My own status with Livvy falls somewhere behind my daughter-in-law (1st) and my son (2nd). And I have worked very hard - very, very hard - for 3rd place and her trust.  She is a gentle soul with many insecurities but we love, love, love the sweet charming personality she has finally let us see.  Livvy, you are now, finally, in your forever family!As in past Christmases, I made my grand dogs their own holiday cookies ... from this book.Yes, I bought this book mostly because there was an English Bull Dog on the cover!But the recipes are very dog-dietary healthy and tasty.The liver cookies are made with whole wheat flour, brown rice and, of course, liver!  What else would a loving grandmother do for her grand babies.The first time I made these cookies I didn't have a cookie cutter.  I just made round disks out of the rolled out dough.  I had a plate of baked ones sitting on the kitchen counter cooling that year - when my husband passed through the kitchen.  He came into the living room munching and said quite causally, \"so these are not chocolate chip cookies, are they.\"  Ha! The next year I had a dog bone cookie cutter!Anyway, today is New Year's Day!  It is the first day of what I expect will be a sensational year!  What better way to start the New Year then with my sensational grand-dogs.All admiring commentsof my terribly good looking grand-dogs,gratefully accepted!Happy New Year All!"},
{"title": "Increase, Decrease, Decrease 2016!", "date": "Thursday, December 31, 2015", "text": "I am not much for resolutions!  In my experience a resolution is good for about 3 days and then it is broken.  I also hate starting anything on a traditional date when \"everyone is starting something\" - i.e. New Years Day. It is just a trap, trap, trap!But this year I am falling into the trap for 3 personal goals. Simply put - Increase, Decrease, Decrease.  I thought I would share them here, because a public admission (and a public flogging if needed) might help compliance beyond 3 days!  Ha!Goals should be measurable.  Pledging to be a happier person is a wonderful life attitude to seek out, but as a goal ...  how do you measure improvement.  My goals are measurable and I have a tracking system set up. So here goes with the public pronouncement.Goal #1I need to Increase my activity.  Man, I hate this goal.  I have started it over many many times on this.  But I keep trying.  The past year was my couch potato year.  I thought 2014 was miserable for me and 2015 was pretty much a loss as well.  2016 must be more active - mostly because this body I have must last me precisely another 38 years (more on that in goal #3) and at this rate it won't.Goal #2I need to Decrease the load my legs haul around each day.  Simply put - lose weight.  I hate this goal, too.  It is so trite and so common and usually so unsuccessful.  But my weight continues to creep up. Sitting on the couch in 2015 didn't help.  I don't care if I \"look younger,\" but I want to feel more energetic.  And if I have another 38 years, it is a long time to feel this way.Goal #3Finally, this goal will make some of you smile.  I need to Decrease my yarn stash.  (the operative word is decrease.)  I don't actually hate this goal.  It is clear, however, that my yarn is secretly reproducing while my back is turned  I could not possibly be guilty of contributing to this obsession!  (I am going to have to answer to God at some point for all these lies!  But for now, lying works.) Here is where the '38 years' comes into play.About 5 years ago I did a yarn inventory, noting type and yardage on an excel spreadsheet.  I owned about 140,000 yards of yarn.  Using a typical measure of knitting up 5,000 yards a year - I could knit for another 28 years without ever buying yarn!  I was appalled!!  Embarrassed actually.  I went on a yarn diet in that moment.  A few years later I updated my inventory and I was bouncing about 170,000 total yards of yarn.  Gads!!!  Epic yarn diet failure!!!  (That was when I decided that I should be buying only male or female yarn.  No more mixing up the sexes.  The yarn was showing no control!!)  I could now knit for another 34 years without buying yarn.  Unacceptable.This fall I updated my inventory - (and by now no one should be surprised) the total was up again.  I now own about 191,000 yards of yarn - and this is with regular knitting and giving away yarn since the last inventory.  Now everyone, all together ... how many years can I knit without buying yarn???       \"38 years!\"   Correct!  You all are so smart.  :-)    But ...Let's get real.For the record I will be buying yarn again!!  I have a love affair with the stuff. It is a hobby that lights up my life. I want my yarn stash numbers to decrease or at least stay the same.  This goal will be the hardest one of all.  Like all 'addicts,' I am reducing my yarn temptations. I stopped all knitting magazine subscriptions, I have 'unsubscribed' from all on line yarn vendors, and I am avoiding yarn stores. It is going to be tough, but my hobby should not take up one whole room in my house - and it does!So welcome 2016!The year of Increase, Decrease, Decrease!"},
{"title": "New Year, New Hobby ... Adult Coloring", "date": "Tuesday, December 29, 2015", "text": "I don't need a new hobby... craft ... past time ... creative endeavor!  You can use any label ... I don't need it.But this fall a new past time captured my attention and apparently I am hooked.  And it seems that I am late to the game on this particular activity.My first completed coloring page.Adult ColoringCome on, guys.  You remember coloring - coloring books and wax crayola crayons!!  For me coloring last happened about 60 years ago.  A new coloring book with a fresh box wax Crayola crayons and I was set.  By the time I was 12 years old I had moved on to Barbies.  I never considered for one second that I would cycle back to coloring books and colored pencils at age 68.My second work in progressTo start with ... these are not your childhood coloring books.  These adult versions of coloring books are works of art in the form of line drawings.  Beautiful drawings ... almost a shame to add anything to them.  As most articles on the subject mention, adult coloring books were not on the merchandising radar 3 years ago.  Now all the books stores, craft stores and even some gift stores carry them.  This holiday season, the adult coloring book displays are mostly empty in my area.  Totally amazing to me.Prismacolor Premier Pencils.  This isn't the largest set.But someday I might spring for their biggest selection.Then there are the coloring tools.  Yes, you can use Crayola crayons if you want, but these adult coloring books are generally not designed for stubby wax crayons.  Color pencils are preferred, or color markers.  As you can see from the samples I have posted here, the pictures are filled with small details.  You need a point to fill them in and wax crayons won't work well for that.  So color pencils or gel markers are almost as remarkable in the complexity of offerings as the coloring books.  And let me tell you, some of those colored pencils sets can be pricey, pricey, pricey.  But oh so pretty.Johanna Basford's Enchanted ForestYou are seeing the face of the slip cover for this book.Of course, there are many extra tools that can be used - like blending pencils, and special erasers, and pencil sharpeners and fancy cases to carry your tools.Here is the actual book - the brown cover with only pen art work on the cover. Under the book is the inside of the slip cover.Every detail of these books are beautifully executed.They are very appealing without adding any color.And, yes, I have outfitted myself with everything.   I am the \"tool queen\" when it comes to any hobby.  Anyone who knows me personally will not be surprised.  But you can get started with very little in investment and have a satisfying experience.But the real question is \"Why?\"  Why color?  Well, there is a psychology connected to this past time. You can read more about it here in this link.  But from my perspective this is what I know:The most often heard reason is that it reduces stress.  I can confirm that is true!  Just like knitting, mediation or any mindful activity that refocuses and/or distracts your brain - it relaxes the mind.  I can also pick up, do a small bit and easily put it down again. I love the artistic part of selecting colors and blending them without worrying about the quality of the underlying drawing - I am happy to leave that to the professional artist.  And I am challenged to improve a beautiful artist's black and white rendering by adding color. Playing with color feeds that area of my brain that I always felt was deficient!  My artistic efforts were always limited to pencil or charcoal.  I could produce a level of realism in a drawing using line and shading.  But when I attempted to layer color onto my own work, it was an epic fail.  This activity allows me to play with color once again.I struggle with the question of what to do with the completed colored page.  For me a hobby or craft is satisfying when it results in something I can enjoy - a product - something beyond the process of creation. Would I sit down and look at my colored books once they are filled?  Would I frame and hang something I colored on the wall?  The answer is most likely no. Recently, however, I came upon some coloring books that seemed to answer that question.   Beyond the simple pleasure of coloring with a child, a fully colored adult book would be a great thing to look at with child - sort of like sharing a picture book.  For example:Coloring books by Johanna Basford - (Secret Garden, Lost Ocean, and Enchanted Forest) have hidden items in each picture.  Kids and adults enjoying hidden object picture books and games.Coloring books by Daria Song - (The Time Chamber, The Time Garden) actually tell a story in pictures - with a small amount of words to flesh out the story.  The artist's pages tell the story of a tiny fairy that lives inside a cockoo clock who has adventures.  A very charming idea presented in a high quality publication - that just happens to be aimed at Adult Colorists.So I am prepared for a year of coloring - to go with all my other hobbies.  In fact, coloring is one of two new hobbies for 2016 - beyond knitting, spinning, weaving and coloring ... but that is for another blog post!So what fun things will fill your new year?"},
{"title": "This Christmas", "date": "Wednesday, December 23, 2015", "text": "My Christmas decorations are up, much reduced over previous years - part of my less is more style of living.  The gifts are all purchased and wrapped - and sit prettily under my tree.Holiday cooking began in earnest two days ago - as well as a house clean up.  I feel on schedule, in control, ready.However,My Christmas tree with gifts this year.Just like every other Christmas for at least a decadeit feels like I am going through the motions.Checking off my to-do list.Preparing to make the holiday grand for the folks I love.But it has been many years since the holidayshave been grand in my own heart.Christmas is a hard holiday for some folks,and I count myself among them.  The Christmas season is filled with too many sad remembrances for me.  I have spent years of Christmases just trying to get to the month of January!This is the oldest ornament on my tree. It was a decoration one of my Christmas gifts from my future mother-in-law in 1967.My dad died on this day, December 23, in 1970.  He always comes to mind during this season. I have long since moved on from that loss, but it still left small sad memories for me.  This metal flag bow was put on the tree the year my son went into the military in the mid 1990s. It was the first Christmas my son was not home with us.In more recent years, the Christmas season has been especially difficult.In early December 2010, mom was hospitalized with a terrible stomach flu that landed herin rehab on discharge.  The year was a race to get her home in time for Christmas.And all the traditional stuff (tree, gifts, cooking, decorations) were held off till December 23.But it was one of the most joyful Christmases - because she made it home.  Mom moved from my home into Assisted Living in early December 2011.  A fall in October and extended rehab November did not help her. That was the first Christmas when she was not with family.  Mom made this lighted ceramic Christmas tree. I am sure most everyone has one of these!But I am just as sure that this one is the loveliest one of all.:-)The elder care community she resided in was exceptional.   Always beautifully decorated for every season.  A festive holiday reception was held for residents and family with delicious food and wonderful entertainment.  The staff was gay and engaged with the residents.  But it never fully compensated for the fact she was not home.  She always asked to go home, especially during the Christmas season.  It was a conversation that always left me sad.A Christmas angel made by my mom during a more  joyful time.Not sure how I feel about the concept of 'heaven', but if there is oneshe most certainly is there - wings and all!Last year mom died on December 28.  Another difficult Christmas.  She had been markedly failing the previous months - and last Christmas was just one long sad goodbye as I sat by her bedside day after day watching her slip away from this world.  The cheer and decorations of the season seemed to be a cruel artificial shell that surrounded my intense sadness. This Christmas is the first anniversary of her death.  I have completed a year of \"firsts without mom.\" Now I feel that circle is finally closed.  She officially slips into my past, but not out of my heart.I miss her - especially this Christmas.  I have been caught totally by surprise this week when I find tears are falling.  Sad images of our last Christmas together are common this week.  Loss is a lonely a feeling when it seems like the world has moved on and memories persist.   Although this memory will never be totally gone, the intensity will fade with time.So this will be a pensive Christmas for me.  Christmas Eve will be filled with our small immediate family - our traditional dinner, gift exchange and a sleep over at our house.  Christmas morning will be our family breakfast.  I will go to Mass and then visit the cemetery, while my son visits with his in-laws - who also are mourning the death of a loved one this past fall.  The rest of my time will be quiet ... maybe a long walk ... maybe time spent with one of my many hobbies ... maybe a distracting activity like planning out my January 2016 calendar.  Once again, I look forward to January.  I just need to get to January.I think 2016 will be a positive new beginning for me.  In fact, I know it will be so!  Christmas 2016 will be better ... because it won't be  this Christmas ... the first one without mom.I wish you all a peaceful and happy Christmas. \"Somethings in life cannot be fixed.They can only be carried.\"Megan Devine"},
{"title": "Christmas Past", "date": "Sunday, December 20, 2015", "text": "It is the season for good will and cheer for all.  Being Christian, I celebrate Christmas.  Of course, in recent years it seems like the word Christmas has been replaced by the word Holiday.  Merry Christmas is now Happy Holidays ... to be more inclusive of all the celebrations that occur during this season.  Sad.  I wish political correctness hadn't evolved to such a meaningless point.Back in the mid 1990s I was the supervisor of a large medical department.  We always celebrated with gusto.  There was no focus on the religious elements of Christmas, just the Santa theme. Santa would arrive bringing good cheer for the employees, we had a pot luck lunch in the department.  The supervisory staff (there were 4 of us) dressed as Santa's elves for the whole day.  I remember that time with great fondness.  Nothing speaks of Christmas as much as bringing smiles to the faces of the employees and patients. Recently one of my former employees found a picture from that time that she shared with me.  In the spirit of good cheer, I share it with you.Hope your holidays (whatever they are) are filled with joy, smiles and good will towards all.  And remember, the best thing you can do this season is to pass all that cheer on to others.  There seems to be a deficit of good cheer in our world today.Don't forget!  Pass it on."},
{"title": "Planner-Calender, Bullet Journal, Commonplace Book", "date": "Monday, December 7, 2015", "text": "I spent my whole adult working life tethered to a planner/calendar of some sort.  I always used a commercial option to keep all the balls of my life from falling to the floor.  It worked pretty good.And as a caregiver, I kept copious written records - since I was managing two lives for 8 years.After my mom's death I entered official retirement ... I dropped all tracking methods keeping my to-dos on short daily 3x5 cards.  Things were simpler now.  Simple life ... simple tracking.After months of using that approach, I discovered it wasn't that simple.When a 'vacuum' occurs - the void fills with other things.  Lots and lots of other things.  The 3x5 cards system failed for a lot of reasons.  And I began to wonder if my mind was slipping.  Stuff fell off my radar with frightening frequency.In truth, my mind probably is slipping.  I guess it retired when the rest of my body did.  So ... with that as a concern I needed better system.My Bullet Journal - of course, I had to purchase a nice cover.Enter the Bullet Journal.I mentioned Bullet Journaling in a previous post.  I purchased a simple plain bound book specifically designed for bullet journaling - but really - the method could be used in any blank book.  I launched a 'test'  journal (which is no longer 'test').  Being a bullet list kind of person, this kind of time management fit me perfectly. It is very individualized including all those bullet lists I put on 3x5 cards, as well as future planning, wish lists, habit trackers, future shopping lists, favorite quotes, and all my brilliant ideas (smile).  Some people do traditional journaling or diary entries in this book and decorate it with art work and colored pens.  I like mine plain, neat and productive. I am getting a whole lot more done.  Less things fall through the cracks of my life.  In fact, checking off those little boxes is sometimes the main reason I do the task!  (Ha!)  I still use a wall calendar for distance planning and to prepare my Bullet Journal each month, but my Bullet Journal holds all the details.  And, as they say, the devil is in the details!Another kind of book has recently hit my awareness. A Commonplace Book.For those who are well versed in historical figures or various kinds of old style literature - you might already know about Commonplace Books.  But for me, this was a new idea.Here is the link that describes the Commonplace Book.  This book is not a planner or a journal.  It is  a place to capture and save those bits of knowledge, quotes, art work, doodles, clips saved from magazines or newspapers and ideas from others that are meaningful to you.  It is a place to house them so that they can be found again should you want to hold that information in your life. Laura BethmannPhoto Credit: LinkThe practice of a Commonplace Book is apparently very old ... used during times when knowledge found in books was not readily available to the general population - books were rare and very expensive.   Over time this kind of book was used less because books became more common and ownership more likely.    It appears now - in the electronic information age - a more modern version of the Commonplace Book might be returning. We are now bombarded with information from every direction and multiple sources often passing at what seems like the speed of sound.  When nuggets of interesting information, a great quote, an impressive idea or a beautiful picture comes to our attention - it can be easily lost with the next thought, or email, or phone call or demand on our time.   The Commonplace Book might be a good place to safely store those eclectic things ... so it is not lost by our memory.This is an idea that appeals to me.  It feels like a creative outlet, an unstructured storage chest for fun quirky things that catch my fancy.  And although my Bullet Journal is a pretty plain Jane bound book - a Commonplace Book could be a beautiful, colorful bound book - special just for itself.Thinking, thinking ..."},
{"title": "One wish ... ", "date": "Thursday, November 12, 2015", "text": "If you could have one material wish (no wishing for world peace here ... ) what would you wish for?That was the question posed by a blogging friend called Paula at Smidgens, Snippets and Bits.  That question seemed to resonate like a huge gong in my brain.And it made me instantly sad and pensive about life.My one wish is as impossible as world peace.  My husband has a degenerative eye condition that over the last 10 years has robbed him of his vision.  Today he is legally blind and at some point in the future, he will be totally blind.  His condition has no cure!My wish would be sight for my husband.In fact, if it was medically possible (it isn't) - I would happily give him one of my eyes.While this statement sounds self sacrificing on my part - it is not!  It is the fatiguing result of watching too much loss around me.I spent the last 8 years watching my mom slowly lose all parts of a life she had independently built up  ... lost through age and dementia ... until finally she was left with only her daughters standing by her beside waiting for the end.  She did not even have the comfort of knowing we were there.  Total and complete loss.Now I watch my husband slowly shed a life time of cherished hobbies.  First to go was some of his independence - no driving.  Then his substantial library of books, followed by his enormous  American Stamp Collection,  and now on the chopping block is his beautiful and valuable toy soldier collection.  TV is now mostly a radio show for him.   Even pouring a cup of coffee without spilling it has become a challenge.The gift of one of my eyes would be a small sacrifice to make to improve his life.But wishing is a waste of time.How easy it is to focus on all the troublesome problems in life.  If problems go on for years and years, it becomes a habit to view life through the lens of loss.This year - the first year of my mom's passing and the first year of increasing disability in my husband - I have allowed my emotions and point of view to settle on what is missing - what is lacking - on loss!  It has sapped my energies.  Fatigue best describes my internal mental state. I need to change the lens I am looking through!So I am pushing myself right now instead of wishing.Organization.  The Bullet Journal has been helpful in putting some control back in my hands.  Gratitude.  I need to write down all the positives - they are many.  Bullet Journal - make room.Adult Coloring!  Yes, coloring for grown ups - and I am not talking about porn coloring books!  I didn't need a new hobby but apparently I have one.  Coloring is apparently a new (old?) hobby - one most likely relegated to children in the minds of many.  But now it has become quite the adult past time to help reduce stress and increase relaxation.  Who knew?  I have new coloring books, new color pencils and I am off and running - well, off and coloring at least. Maybe I will post a picture or two.Legos - opps!  See a theme here?  I will blog more on that later.Knitting - nothing replaces the satisfaction I get from knitting.Walking ... enough said.If I have one strength  ... it is my ability to adapt and change.  Lately, however, it is harder than normal.  Fatigue is a powerful enemy.  But I have little patience for people who sit and say \"poor me\" and do nothing about it. I have lost patience with poor fatigued me!  Working on a different description.How about you?  Any wishes?"},

{"title": "A journal of a different kind.", "date": "Monday, November 9, 2015", "text": "Over the years I have had almost every kind of calendar / planner you could name.  They were always paper - never digital.This year I went \"rogue.\"   With little structure in my life - no job or caregiving duties to wrap my days around - I assumed my simple life could be reduced to a simple bullet list on 3x5 cards. Each day a new card.  Undone tasks transferred to the next day's card.  Completed cards - thrown away.Well ... it hasn't been pretty!  Not pretty at all.First off the cards would be prepared and then ignored.  Opps!  That's a fail!  Then cards got lost.  Great.  Now I have to rely on my 68 year old memory.  Another failure in the making.  Finally, if the cards were completed, they were trashed and the information was lost.  Mostly that wasn't a big deal because things like ... clean toilets, do laundry, and take a walk - aren't huge losses if they aren't saved for posterity.But other lost details were sometimes important.  It is nice to when your last mammogram was done, when that specific bill payment was sent (since the post office lost 3 pieces of our mail in the last 6 months) and did you send that birthday card/anniversary card/wedding gift?So the 3x5 cards had to go!  I searched and searched for a planner - finally bought one.  But it was totally ignored.  I was back to the 3x5 cards (the writing, the ignoring, the losing, the pitching.)Enter the Bullet Journal.I learned about bullet journaling from a blog I follow called Assortment.  The blogger just started using a bullet journal and I followed her link to a Bullet Journal site to watch a video.  It all clicked in my brain.  Then I watched some videos of other bullet journaling folks.  I learned that your journal can be as minimalistic or as elaborate as you desire.Here are the pros from my perspective (I think I will use bullets ... Ha!  )It is analog - just the kind of planner/journal I prefer. It has a stitched bound spine - not loose leaf or spiral bound.  Yet it lays flat. Pages are not printed with a manufacturer's organizational structure.  Pages are dotted - sometimes a grid.  You create your own structure and boundaries. Simple or complex. No wasted pages (like financial tracking, or telephone lists, or exercise logs - unless you add it in.)I am less likely to lose a book - not like those illusive 3x5 cards.There is no fixed end date - like December 31.  Use up the pages then move onto a new journal.  Structure can be customized on the fly.  Reduce or add more as needed.The cons (and there is only one for me):You build the journal - that almost sounds like a pro statement, but it does involve some time to set up.  I think I can off set that by keeping my journal simple - it doesn't need to house my whole life.  That is it. I watched several YouTube videos on this topic and it is interesting to see what folks include.  Shopping lists, weekly menus, recipes, reading lists ... you name it.  Some journals include decorations like a scrap book and a place for actual journal writing (not bullets.)  Some include tabs, others include add-in pages that are preprinted to minimize set up.  All are stored safely in a simple book.Or it can simply house an organized bulleted list of tasks using the Bullet Journal techniques described at BulletJournal.com.  Check out the link to get a quick sense of how it is set up if interested.My new bullet journal was delivered today and I am off to set it up. I love lists and bullets and keeping on track to get things done.  Keeping my fingers crossed that 3x5 cards are history ... and this tool helps make things \"pretty\" again."},

I don't think we should do that.This is the image we should hold in our minds.Remember this man!Remember that some people jumped to certain death rather than stay in the inferno of those buildings.Remember that as our innocent citizens fell from the building  they knew with certainty that these were their last seconds of life on earth ...approximately 10 seconds ...Remember that those on the ground below will never forget the terrible thudding sounds of bodies hitting pavementone after another - over and over - about 200 times.If this post makes you upset, uncomfortable, angry, or sad, then I have achieved my goal.

The title was Jumpers.From the reading I have done - it appears that the New York chief medical examiner's office does not consider these people \"jumpers.\"  Jumping indicates a choice and would imply suicide.  These people did not have a choice probably because of the force of the explosion, the fire behind them and the lack of breathable air.  Because of these conditions the deaths were ruled homicide.  It is a small but merciful distinction.   They most certainly were murdered."},

It will alwaysbe with me and it will be worn by me.  I learned to knit as a reaction to a stress filled management job of 7 years.  Those years were filled with long days and long long weeks.  It got so crazy that it would take me 3 work days to prepare for vacation, and 3 vacations days to unwind from work.    Oh, most of that crazed life style was my own doing.  But you know it is bad when you are living and breathing a job - no hobbies, no reading for fun, friends and family time shrinking, lists upon lists of things to remember and do - all job related.So it probably is no surprise that in 1997 it all came to a screeching halt.  I quit that job without having another job in place.  Oh, I was professional about it ... giving them four months notice, but I had an end date ... a light at the end of the tunnel ... and I was making my escape.  Thankfully I had a husband who understood.And then I found knitting.Actually I asked my husband about maybe taking a 7 week \"learn to knit\" class at my local yarn store and it was a pricey class.  He agreed with the statement, \"Why not.  It is cheaper than therapy.\"  Hmm ... guess he saw that I was reaching critical mass in that job too.A special picture of mom, my sister and I (L to R.).And my sweater is the Central Park Hoodie - afun sweater to knit and wear.And a knitter was born.  Knitting filled a need that nothing else could do.  It occupied my hands and mind in a meditative way - my soul needed that.  It had a beginning, middle and end - my type A personality needed that.  And it was a creative activity that produced with a beautiful item - well, maybe not beautiful the first year when my skill level was that of \"rookie.\"  But from then on many lovely projects have emerged.The start of my current shawl project with beads on the ends.Knitting not only healed all the broken parts of me in those early years, but it sustained me during some of the hardest years of my life taking care of my mom.  I made several beautiful things for her during her time with me and she was buried in a shawl I made for her during the last year of her life.  It gives me comfort to know she is wrapped in something right now I made for her.A cable and lace poncho I knitted for my daughter.It was an great design starting at the bottom of theponcho and decreasing your way up to the neck.And now knitting is still giving.  This year I find myself at loose ends. Mom is gone.  My husband is becoming more or more disabled.  That \"caregiver mantel\" I so carefully set aside at my mom grave site is slowly and persistently finding it place back on my shoulders once again.  Knitting fills a void and allows some escape.  Nothing else is capable of keeping the edges of my life all glued together in a sane way like knitting - not even blogging.Rigid Heddle Loom - a cozy kind of activity.I enjoy the process and will do this again and again.Just not right now - the knitting needles call.I have been pulled into related crafts.  I can crochet, I do weave on occasion, and spinning fiber tugs at my desires now and then.   I love my looms, my spinning wheel and my spindles, but they will never replace my knitting needles.  Knitting is the activity my hands reach for when I need constancy, escape and peace.A lace and bead shawl I made for my daughter that almost killed me with frustration.I swore more during this project than any other in 17 years.And I pledged I would never do anything life this again.But the end result turned out beautiful I think.And I decided in an absolute instant ...I think I could knit something like this again.Just like childbirth!!Knitting can hurt like the devil and you swear \"never again\"and then you forget and are just so pleased with theobject completed and you think ...oh that wasn't so bad.I think I could do this again!Ha!The knitting life for me!"},
{"title": "Move", "date": "Monday, August 17, 2015", "text": "I live in a neighborhood that was built about 30 years ago.  My husband and I are original residents so I remember a time when all the growth was young and not very big.  I love the maturity of the vegetation and how it provides a cool and shaded space to live and walk.Really, there is no excuse for not walking in my neighborhood.  It is safe and well maintained and comfortable.But for some darn reason finding time for walking is always a struggle for me.  This spring I started out so well with a routine of regular exercise.  Then the house renovations started.  Three weeks of painting, and a week of kitchen renovation ... and all those weeks and weeks to prepare and clean out and recover.  No walking then.  And some days the heat was more of an assault than even these lovely trees could cope with.Excuses, excuses, excuses.That is all those barriers were ... just excuses.Last week I began again to establish a walking routine.  And I kept thinking about the why and how of my struggle with this simple habit.And then I saw it.  The example of what happens to you when you don't keep active.  I saw it on my walk and it is a picture I just might put on my fridge to motivate me.This is an old road way that was closed to through traffic over 30 years ago. It ends at a creek where the bridge was washed away in a long-a-go hurricane.Do you see it?It is so obvious that you might miss it if you are looking too closely.  The side walk suddenly narrows.  Oh, the side walk is still there - hiding under the overgrowth of nature, but the path shrinks remarkably when not tended.I live just to the left of this picture.Here is the view with me standing on the narrow path.  And literally, this is where I feel like I am looking at my walking life at present. Standing on a narrow untended path.You would think the example of inactivity in my mom's life would put the fear of God into me.  And it did for a time.  But images like that fade from memory.I am a very visual person.  I do best with graphic examples.  My visual memory is petty darn good as evidenced by road trips when I could find my way back without a map - because I had \"come this way before,\" ... even it is was years and years ago.And so, in my walking world, I have come this way before.  I am standing in a place that is not well tended and I see where I want to go.   Aim for enough activity to broaden the path - my life.  This image also accurately shows how quickly you lose stamina over 60.  When I was 30 I could hold onto energy without much effort.  Now if there is no effort, the path narrows very very quickly.  Nuts!This aging process certainly is a whole lot of work.  No wonder so many folks just give up and sit!Out of respect to the body that got me this far - I am a bit more reasonable about expectations, but \"reasonable\" is not my normal mode of operation when it comes to exercise.  I am wired to be a competitive person - always looking to do more - be the best - aim for the lead.  And because of that exercise has always been \"all or nothing\" thinking.  After all, you can't be competing all the time.  Competing means there is a start and a finish - and someone wins.  This less younger version of me has had to readjust that thinking.  Walking doesn't have a start and finish as a habit.  The goal is not to be a winner, just physically a more active version of me.Now my goal is to just move!  It isn't important that I beat last month's time, or walk more miles than I did last week.  The goal has slipped comfortably into what makes sense now - keep moving - and hold onto 10,000 steps a day average.  Those steps don't have to be fast, they don't have to be all at one time - but they should happen ... just happen!  As far as goals go, this one couldn't be more simple.So here I go again. Pedometer says today I have only 525 steps - at 8:23 am this morning.  Only 9,500 more to go!"},
{"title": "Jacket Sweater Done!", "date": "Wednesday, August 12, 2015", "text": "The picture above is the bodice of my green jacket sweater I made for myself back in 2009.  It is called the Faery Ring Jacket by Mary Scott Huff and it is a free knitting pattern on Ravelry.   I fell in love with it the moment I saw it.  I will say that this jacket sweater is an enormous project - the hem falls mid thigh, there is a hood, and the bodice is all cables.  It is a whole lot of knitting.  I would guess the number of stitches in this sweater are equal to knitting two sweaters.  It took me almost a year to finish my jacket.  But the finished product is lovely.  Love at first sight for me.And apparently it was love at first sight for my cousin, who saw my jacket one visit in 2013.  She tried on my jacket and offered to pay me to make her one.  Well, I don't knit for pay and I definitely don't knit for pay for family.  That afternoon we sat down together and she picked a color for her own jacket ... this beautiful blue.I am sorry to say it took me two years to finish her jacket, but as my other cousin (her sister) reminded me ...  \"you had a lot going on these last 2 years.\"  Yes, I guess I did, but this spring, I decided that this jacket had to be finished.  And I finished it in July.  And here is the proof!!  And as far as accepting payment ... I did get compensated!  Look at that beautiful smile.  Love you very much dear cousin.  Wear that jacket in good health!!Other knitting projects that have waited patiently behind this one are now in the works."},

These are the days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill.  It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom.  A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete.Remember to spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever.Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.Remember, to say, 'I love you' to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it.  A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again.Give time to love, give time to speak!  And give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.And always remember, life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by those moments that take our breath away.\""},
{"title": "My Time Machine", "date": "Thursday, July 30, 2015", "text": "Recovery from care giving is taking longer than I thought. Not recovery from mourning a loss - although I still miss mom every single day.  No, this particular \"recovery\" is more related to my current life ... more of a constant discovery of where I am in the aftermath of care giving.Don't get me wrong ... I can't imagine making different choices for the last 10 years.  Nope!  I would do it all again.  But I must have naively thought when all this care giving stuff passed into my personal history, I would just pull up my \"big girl\" panties, square my shoulders ...  and move on with  life exactly as I planned when I was 50.Reality has been different.  It is more like a time machine experience. When I stepped into the care giving time machine I was in my late 50s.  I was working and looking forward to all the free time and activities of a planned retirement.  Now I have stepped out of the time machine. I am ten years older.  The landscape of my life has changed - inside and outside.  My previous plans seem to have drifted away like a puff of smoke.And strangely that is ok!I suspect that this is nature's way of slowing down the \"busy-bee mentality of living\" and making space for a more mindful life.  Instead of running around checking off my retirement list of to-dos, I find my days naturally shifting in a different direction.***I can hear the comments rattling around out there.  \"Huh oh!She has lost it.What the heck is she talking about?Did she read this in a book somewhere?Is she drifting into a esoteric space?\"In my defense I guess this is what happens when you have the time to think about things.  Weird stuff pops out.  :-)  But stick with me a bit longer.***Looking at the arc of my life from the 30,000 foot perspective - it looks like this:Rocky childhoodGood healthEducationStable marriageWonderful kids Professional successGood friendsNice abodeDedicated care giverRetired.Good health (still)Family LongevityIn the grand scheme of life, I am one of the luckier individuals on this planet.   Other than my early years and my care giving experience,  my life followed a predictable and satisfying pattern.So the real question is ... what now? I thought I had the answer to that question - I had retirement nailed!  Topping the list of activities was travel, volunteer work, a fun part time job, hiking .... just to name a few.  But I don't have this period nailed down at all.  My retirement plans seem jumbled and not in sync with where I am at right now.  And I think I know what happened! Mother Nature stepped in while I wasn't looking and said ... \"Hey you, listen up!You have slipped into the arc of your lifewhere things are processed differently in your mind and in your body.You need to respect that.So get over yourself!\"Ahh, thank you very much, Mother Nature, for that in-your-face reminder!  I didn't build any of that into my retirement planning.Now my retirement has a more realistic focus:Stretch those muscles every night so you can walk upright every morning.Gently greet the new day and don't expect too much before coffee.Keep walking so you can stay on your own two legs.Eat carefully so your stomach doesn't punish you.Drink water - dehydration is not your friend.Simplify.

{"title": "The Silly Season - A Rant!", "date": "Tuesday, July 21, 2015", "text": "I can't believe we are approaching the very early stages of another election season.  The \"silly season\" is what I call this time of year, but I won't bore you with all the reasons why I picked this label. Elections are a necessary function in a representative government, even if our particular process is flawed and frustrating.In fact, this post is going to be \"A RANT!!\"  Sorry, I don't rant here very often.  Actually my only other rant was October 2010 - same topic.  Guess two rants in 5 years isn't too bad.  But if you want to skip this post, I don't mind.  However, when a blogger warns that their post will be a RANT, I find it hard to turn away.  Like a car wreck ... I feel the need to slow down to see what happened, but I really don't want to see what happened, but I look anyway, but I wish I hadn't, but I would do it  ... and so on and so on.  Oh well.You were warned!Here I go.OH . MY . DEAR . GOD!! How I totally hate the circus our political election process has become.  Lost are things like civility, fact finding, balanced and fair exchange of ideas, comparison of issues,  respect for different positions, intelligent research, and polite debate.All of the above have been replaced by insults, belligerent name calling, and slanted opinions that slip into outright lies about political figures and their positions.  Enormous sums of money are wasted on attack TV ads, hand outs, and campaign signs that end as litter on our roadways.  Really??  Does anyone make up their mind on who to vote for based on a card board sign with a name on it??  Let's not forget the invasive political robo phone calls that squeeze themselves into our lives between with other unsolicited calls.  I don't even understand how the huge TV spectacles of conventions promote anything useful beyond whipping up the electorate into a frenzy.  All that money and time wasted just to draw attention.It is a nightmare to me.On top of that, even when the election is over, we have become a nation of disrespectful, finger pointing citizens who seem to take joy in saying simply awful insulting things about our elected leaders.  It seems in the eyes of some of us, our current leaders can do absolutely NOTHING right.  If we don't agree with their political positions, then they must be wrong about EVERYTHING. That particular national trait makes me nuts.I am not a Democrat or Republican.  I proudly identify as an independent because I don't believe one political party has all the answers just as I don't believe any one person is all good or all bad.  All of us are shades of gray with some sterling moments tossed into the mix.  Sure, there are a rare few elected officials who get caught putting themselves above the law or in unethical situations.  But generally people enter public service with good intentions.  At least I like to think so.Another frustration for me is social media.  Wow.  How entitled and free some people feel as they slam our leaders in the \"Public Court Room of Facebook.\"  Some postings are so unbelievably ridiculous.  Comments generated are completely appalling!  All that poison get shared with thousands of people, usually bringing out the worst in us.  How can reasonable thinking people identify a sitting president as an \"SOB, hateful, Evil, the worst president ever,\" just to name a few terrible labels.  Come on, folks!  These are completely unacceptable labels for a person who was elected to the office by us, the citizens.  You may not have voted for him or her, and you may not agree with the current leader's ideas, but \"evil?\"  Really?  And as for \"the worst president ever,\" I doubt the general public knows enough presidential history to make an educated guess at who is the worst.   While I do recognize that some elected officials have been caught in discretions that are wrong or shameful, the vast majority of our elected officials are citizens just like us doing the best they can in impossible situations.  So Social Media folks - back the heck off - and use words that don't make you look ignorant.I try hard to keep my own personal criticisms of the Presidents limited, as being President is probably the hardest job ever.  I don't have access to all the relevant facts on many decisions to qualify me as expert enough to take cheap shots at the person we have put in charge.  Staying on top of and coordinating all the details of national decisions is a full time job that most of us don't have the background or time for.  That is why our government has a full time job for doing just that ... it is called \"President.\"  And if you don't think this job is difficult, just look at each retiring President as they leave office.  They age considerably doing what we elected them to do - that aging didn't happen because the job was easy.And how about all the criticisms we send towards our elected Congress!  I will agree that they have become stalled along party lines and really aren't earning their salaries.  But how can we expect congress to come together and work for the common good if we, the people they represent, have become stalled and derisive, and don't feel committed to working for the common good either.  Sometimes I wonder if Congress is just a mirror image of us.Depressing.Maybe it has always been like this ... but to my eye, it seems to be getting worse with each year.    Maybe the curmudgeon in me is coming out.  I don't know.But I do know this ... if we don't find a way to be civil and work together effectively during and after an election - then our country is mostly bluster - not substance.  And \"bluster\" cannot be the leader of the Free World - at least not for long.  It will be our Achilles heel as a nation.I know I have painted a sad picture in very simplistic terms.  Not everyone behaves as badly as I have described.  Otherwise I would consider packing my bags and moving to Canada (Canada would let me in ... right, Delores??)   :-)  But the \"badly behaving individuals\" are the loudest.  They overshadow the quiet majority.Ok,I think I am done now.Rant is over.It didn't change anything, but I feel lighter!Everyone needs to do that once in awhile.If you stuck around to the very end, thank you.  Feel free to vent back, agree or disagree, etc.  This post was my personal opinion and I know opinions vary.  I would love to hear yours.While you do that - I will be building my virtual hibernation hole until the \"silly season\" passes in late 2016!"},
{"title": "July 20  - A Five Year Blog-a-versary.", "date": "Monday, July 20, 2015", "text": "Today is my 5th Blog-a-versary!Gosh.  Five years!Has that much time passed since I sent a first post out into the blog-a-sphere??I recently paged through a few old posts.  I changed a lot inside since those early days.A bit of naval gazing seems appropriate now.My blog was launched in 2010 during a busy and sad time of my life.  I was buried deep in elder-care issues for my mom having slipped into that role in 2006.  But by 2010 I was drowning in it.  Solitary  full time elder caregiving can devour you in a way that is hard to put into words.  It is a slow depressing slide down hill for the senior and the caregiver.  In 2010 I felt I was waving a white flag in the battle to maintain both our lives.   I was looking for a safe place to hold the \"me-things\" that were slipping off my radar.  This blog was my life preserver ... literally a preserver of a life I was putting on hold.And it worked. I wrote about everything including things important to me - not me, the caregiver, - but me, the \"used-to-be\" working professional, wife, mother, crafter, walker, friend ... the me who was still interested in everything life had to offer ... but had to put it most of it aside to be me, the caregiver and daughter.  That receptacle of \"me\" was this blog.But even with that goal, in 2011 my mom started to take center stage here as well.  I felt compelled to share the struggles and the emotional turmoil I was holding inside.  I needed to let go of some of it in a controlled bleed rather than an explosive eruption.  That slow controlled bleed of pressure was a  series of blog posts called Through My Care Giver Eyes.   Writing allowed me to put some space between me and the life I was leading.  It helped me to look at things through my mom's eyes and see that all this struggle was ours together.   It cemented my love and commitment to her even after I had to let let go of her primary care to Brooke Grove Assisted Living.  I felt closer to her in the writing process.  We were walking this path together ... to the end. In hindsight, I am glad for other reasons that I wrote about that journey.  Now that she is gone ...  those posts and memories serve another purpose.  The blog holds the story how I changed as a person because of her.  It also holds those precious life experiences that would fade from memory with time unless they were written down.  What started as a coping mechanism, became a tribute to the woman who was my mom.The decision to bring mom into my home have far reaching impacts to this day.  Some of life's opportunities have passed beyond my reach because of that decision. Delaying things so many years at my age does not allow much wiggle room in achieving bucket list accomplishments.  But I don't mourn that loss.  Some life goals we choose for ourselves are frivolous with no real value.  The role of caregiver that I naively adopted with an open heart ranks up there for me with motherhood.  I made a difference in the life of someone else.And I learned like never before about myself.  The world did not end when I pushed back on authority, when I let my rough edges show, and when I walked away from unsupportive relationships.  A black hole did not swallow me up when I fired a physician, demanded accountability and questioned medical opinion.  I am now more results-driven, less worried about what others think, stronger in relying on my own decisions,  and more reflective on what is really important. Did all these changes make me a more like-able person?  Probably not.  I still have trouble filtering the comments that escape from my brain.  I have less patience and understanding for some people.  But I am more at peace with myself - because my life has value in my own eyes.  My life had value to my mom especially towards the end when she had lost everything else.   This blog holds all that for me. In other five years, what will be housed here, will there be another evolution of me tapping on the computer keys ... hard to know.  I might not even be blogging.  I don't focus as much on the future.  I try to live in the \"now.\"   But I am so grateful to have captured a small important part of my past in this space and a small part but important part of my mom's past resides here with me as well.Something to cherish.Happy Anniversary, dear blog.Thank you readers for being there."},

Ok ...  spinning is more of a future passion but you get the idea.that my 68 year old legs are strong from climbing all the steps inside and out for years and years and years.  I hate the steps on grocery day, but when I am 80 I will hopefully be able to stand on two legs - not three (cane) or four (walker) or no legs (wheel chair.)  I think of it as a personal gift from my house to meSo, there you go.

{"title": "Sons of Anarchy or The Tale of a Biker Family", "date": "Tuesday, June 30, 2015", "text": "Tonight I will be watching the the finale of The Sons of Anarchy.I typically \"watch TV\" using Netflix, which means I hardly ever watch shows when they are aired.  I love to just sit down and watch 2 or 3 episodes of a TV show for an evening's entertainment while I am exercising or knitting.  And then repeat the next night and the next, until I am done.Typically I seek out series that run for multiple seasons and have 4 or 5 stars in the rating system.  I figure if a TV series has been renewed over and over again - it must have some kind of drawing power, quality, high entertainment value ... and so far using the criteria of high ratings and long runs has not failed me.But back to The Sons of Anarchy. I am not into guns or motorcycles or violence. And I passed over watching this show several times because I am just not into stories that focus on an outlaw motor cycle gang/club family.  I couldn't imagine that it would be anything I would want to watch.BUT, I am here to tell you this series has been totally absorbing.  Last night I was up until 11:30 and would have watched the final episode - but I was just dog-tired.  So I saved the finale for tonight. The cast is amazing.Katey Sagal (Married with Children fame) plays Gemma Teller Morrow and is phenomenal in this part.  She plays the matriarchal biker mom to a \"T\".  A very beefy role for her. Charlie HunnamCharlie Hunnam plays her son, Jax Teller.  He steps into the role of leader over the course of the series.  He starts out very normal-ish for a biker club member with the goal to make the club more legitimate, but he eventually evolves into a violent, sad and tragic person.  He is also extremely extremely handsome, don't you think?  :-)  Ron Perlman plays, Gemma's husband, Clay Morrow, and is the club leader at the beginning of the series.I am not upset by blood or violence or nudity or sex - if you are ... this is not the show for you. But the drama and story are incredibly compelling and those elements are totally fitting in this story.On the up side, there is talk that there will be a prequel to The Sons of Anarchy which would be great!  But right now it is just in the planning.So now I am looking for future viewing suggestions from you.I have already seen all of (or all that is currently available:)DexterHouse of CardsThe West WingThe Walking DeadBreaking BadGame of ThronesOutlanderBonesCastleScandalBuffy the Vampire SlayerThe SopranosAs you can see, my interests are very very broad.So let me hear what you think is good."},
{"title": "The Joy of Less by Francine Jay", "date": "Friday, June 26, 2015", "text": "In an earlier post I recommended a web site called Miss Minimalist.   As the title suggest, her focus is the minimalist life style. She has written several books on this topic.   The Joy of Less, A minimalist Living Guide: How to Declutter, Organize, and Simplify Your Life, by Francine Jay is the book I just finished. My overall impression - this is a good reference book on minimalism.  She writes very well.  She has a practical organized approach.  She doesn't swing to extremes in her advice.  Of course, if you are new to this idea, you might find some advice daunting - like emptying your closet of everything as a first step to minimizing your clothes.   But that advice is consistent with all other authors and it is an effective first step.  For folks new to the topic of simplicity and minimalism, this is a great book.  For everyone else, it is an informative and organized approach worth your time. I wouldn't say there were any magic bullets in this presentationfor achieving your own level of minimalism.  Clean out your stuff, manage what comes in and \"walk the talk\" every day.  Just like dieting - no magic bullets - eat less, move more. It is just too bad it isn't that easy.  That is where the book helps greatly to organize your efforts and increase success.There are 4 basic sections: PhilosophyStreamline (Trash, Treasure, Transfer)Room by RoomLife Style.   I feel the most important section is Philosophy.  Once you understand and adopt why minimalism makes life better, efforts to reach it are not so hard.  Rather than expounding the details - I have listed the chapter headings - as they describe the high level points better than anything I could write.PhilosophySee your stuff for what it isYou are not what you ownLess stuff = Less stressLess stuff = More freedomBecome detached from your stuffBe a good gatekeeperEmbrace spaceEnjoy without owningThe joy of enoughLive Simply, so that others may simply live - Mahatma GandhiWhile I totally recommend this book - it is just a guide.  It all comes down to \"the doing.\"  After the Philosophy section - the rest of the book is about \"the doing.\"  Good advice in a logical package.The act of doing (rather than reading about doing) is where people get tripped up.  It is not the owning or the reading or the talking about the book that gets you to the goal.  It is the doing!  And doing takes time.  If you can't devote the time, nothing you read will make a difference.  And there really are no short cuts to devoting the time.  No magic bullet.  If you devote the time and change your life style, you can do or be anything you want.A short personal story that illustrates this point. When I was a young stay-at-home mother, I had a friend and neighbor who was a stay-at-home mother too. We were about the same age.  We each had two children about the same ages.  Our townhouses were exactly the same.  We visited each other's houses, regularly share lunch together, let the kids play, etc.   Her house was always immaculate, organized, comfortable and (most importantly) simple.  My house was pretty much the opposite.  One day I was sitting at her kitchen table while she prepared lunch, and I really watched what she did.  She continued to visit with me as she worked.  She was engaged with the kids.  But she was also not idle.  She put things away, she wiped counters, she kept puttering and she did this all automatically while we visited.  I never noticed how much she got done while she visited.  I doubt she was aware either. It was her default movement around in her own house.  When I left - everything in her house was picked up and clean.  When she visited me, I usually spent about an hour or more after she left doing what she did naturally as part of her routine.A minimalism life style looks a little like that.  Just part of your life style.  It is part of your everyday decision making.  It is not a separate action (except for the initial purge.)Hope you will take the time to check out Francine Jay's book. Get educated.  It is a very good resource and an excellent step 1 if you are considering this journey.\"Cultivating an attitude of gratitude is far more conducive to a minimalist lifestyle.  If we recognize the abundance in our lives, and appreciate what we have, we will not want for more.  We simply need to focus on what we have, rather than what we don't have.\"  Francine JayPost script:I did read another best seller called The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing by Marie Kondo.   While I feel Ms. Kondo's book was ok, it did seem to slip into what I consider excessive attention to minor details.  For example: the organization of a sock drawer.  I can get on board with keeping the quantity of socks to a reasonable limit - and I agree that all socks should be in one place (i.e. a sock drawer.)  But she goes to some lengths to recommend the proper folding and arrangement of socks in the sock drawer.  That level of detail was too much for me.  I suspect cultural influences are at play here.  My own bias also shows in my reaction I guess. My mother-in-law lived her life in excessive levels of detail.  If you opened her kitchen drawer you would find her spoons, knives and forks all lined up carefully placed on their sides - spooning.  If she was still alive, she would be very comfortable with Ms. Kondo's methods.It has been awhile since I read this book.  But it didn't make the same impression on me that The Joy of Less did.   However, no one resource has all the answers.  And no one style of minimalism fits everyone.   Ms. Kondo's description of the management of a sock drawer must have resonated with a lot of people - it is a best seller.  Different strokes ...Read it and decide for yourself."},

They bring flowers, they clean off the memorial, they say prayers.  It is a very personal connection they feel.I have never felt that way about where she is laid to rest.  The essence of who she was is no longer on this earth.  Her life and my memories of her are housed inside me.  I carry her with me every day.  Sometimes I look in the mirror and marvel that I look a lot like her.  I do think of her often - usually when I am alone during quiet times.  Sometimes I am in tears as I think of what we lived through together.  Sometimes the memories cause me to smile.  But mostly I am just sad - and miss seeing her face.Mother's Day seemed like the perfect day for this visit.  I wanted to be sure her grave marker was correct and properly mounted, and that I could remember exactly where her grave was since it is a very large cemetery.  I was distracted at the grave site service in January.All was well.  At first I was surprised that her grave was not totally grassed over, but then I realized that they probably didn't seed it until late April.  New grass wouldn't grow in January.  Silly me.The cemetery was busy.  I guess many people choose Mother's Day or Father's Day to visit their parents.  I know I will return next Mother's Day - but I will be back again before then.Meanwhile ... she is remembered ... and loved ... and missed ... still."},
{"title": "Your shopping DNA!", "date": "Thursday, June 18, 2015", "text": "It is funny how touching every single thing you own in the world can change your behavior  ...  at least a bit.While recovering from back spasms, I took the time to look at my local town newspaper.  I seldom do this anymore - I am just not a newspaper kind of person.  But the paper is free and shows up on  my door step every week, so I settled down to see what I had been missing.Nothing!  I doubt I will be looking again any time soon.But I did notice a few advertised sales and it did prompt a reflection or two.The act of shopping logically results in something that comes into the house.  Recently I have been focused on things going out of the house.As I was checking out these sales I realized that my perspective has changed.  In fact, I was so changed that I stopped looking and just discarded the paper.I got to thinking ...There is nothing that I want/need at present - but - looking at the sales I saw some interesting \"this or that\" at a great price.  Hmm ...I generally hate shopping in brick and mortar stores.  It takes up too much time.  You have to get in the car, drive, park, walk into the store, look around, maybe stand on line, or maybe discover they don't have \"this or that,\" then get back in the car, and repeat the process at another store.  Trips to the store or reading sales literature often results in extraneous purchases not on my current need list -  totally impulse buys - and are potential clutter once brought into the house.I used to LOVE to go shopping!  Not so much now.  I much prefer to order on line and let someone deliver the item to my door.  Yikes, when did this disconnect happen?For example:  A few years back I was very focused on reducing our grocery spending.  In my typical fashion I read up on ways to save on this expenditure.  I clipped and sorted coupons.  I periodically purged for expiration dates.  I had a big box for coupons!!  I looked for double and triple coupon days at our local stores and I visited many stores seeking the best price using sales and coupons.  I even kept a price book listing our staples by name, size, and best price.  The book helped me identify if a sale was really the best price based on history.  The whole process was so time consuming it became almost a part time job.   I was never able to buy $125 worth of groceries for $30 like you sometimes saw as examples to aspire to.  And here is how crazy it was ... I don't even like to cook and yet here I was deeply engrossed in a cooking related activity.  During that time our food expenditure mostly went up.  We purchased more food than we needed because it was a \"great price\" and we would use it in the future.  Ironically those rock-bottom priced items sometimes got tossed after a time because we had more than we could use and they would go passed their expiration date.  It was a total fiasco for me.  Looking back I can see it was a nutty use of energy.Now we grocery shop at one store only each week, I seldom use coupons, I will shop sales, but I don't buy ahead and I seldom check the ads for sales.  Our bills have gone down.  But even with those changes, we still seem to have too much food in the house.  I am working to correct that.Sadly that grocery example has played out in other purchases as well.   I am hoping this is all in the past.Apparently decluttering has done more than just injuring my lower back.   My \"want/need\" level regarding items has been significantly lowered.   It is like my shopping DNA has been chemically altered.  Nuts!  I wish this had happened many years ago.  Just think of how rich I would be now if I hadn't spent all that money shopping.So how do you shop?Is it for need or want?Is it for amusement?Are you an internet shopper or do you prefer \"brick and mortar stores?\" Personal Disclaimers (or the devil is in the details):  :-)My hobby stuff is exempt from this whole discussion.  :-) My old shopping self is still very much alive in my hobbies.  Baby steps, baby steps  ...I value the brick and mortar store as a necessary part of our economy - I do support several despite my aversion to shopping in them.Clothing and food for me are best made in a brick and mortar store."},
{"title": "Paying the Price", "date": "Wednesday, June 17, 2015", "text": "The last two months have certainly been strenuous and busy with \"house stuff.\"  Sorting, packing, lifting, discarding, and generally shedding the stuff of decades sapped a lot of energy.  Each day I  worked for a fixed amount of time, then focused on routine stuff like laundry and cooking, and then collapsed for a rest.  Before bed I enjoyed an hour or so of downtime - knitting, NetFlix, reading.  I thought it was a pretty balanced approach.But the \"personal stuff\" that helped to maintain my physical wellbeing was lacking.I promised myself that once the lion's share of house stuff was done I would get back to personal stuff like walking daily, strength/stretching, and watching my diet. Frequent conversations with myself argued that 10 years ago I could have done both - house stuff and personal stuff - at the same time.  But I have accepted the fact that now splitting my focus results in nothing getting done very well.   Probably a subtle age related phenomenon.  *Sigh*.So the lion's share of the house stuff is done ... but I am now paying the price for ignoring the personal stuff.Sunday morning I woke up with a back spasm.  No brainer - too much lifting and carrying.   It was my back's way of stating the obvious ... \"See, you are not in your 30s - not even close - and if you do stupid stuff, I will be sure you pay the price.\"  Thank you, Mr. Back.  I got the message! But carry on is what I chose to do (apparently I got the message but didn't learn the lesson.)Monday - I tried to go for a walk but within 25 feet of my front door I turned around and came back.  Advil, muscle relaxants and rest were pretty much the activities of that day.Tuesday - Walked down the street very slowly for about 250 feet - had one back spasm that buckled my right knee.  I returned to the house even slower.  Repeat Monday activities.Today - Better.  Walked slowly around the block.  No spasms but my back is sore and it reminded me to keep my pace slow.   I stopped frequently to shake out stiffness in my hips and thighs.  Hard to know if that was due to lack of regular exercise or if it was a guarding action of surrounding muscles to the lower back injury.  A little of both I guess.  During those stops I enjoyed the view - and took some pictures.But I am encourage.  Progress.It is, however, appalling just how quickly you can lose physical strength and stamina after the age of 60.Tomorrow??  More of the same - need to get my daily step totals up to 10,000 a day like I did for so many months before."},

{"title": "Lesson Learned #5 - Attachments", "date": "Wednesday, June 10, 2015", "text": "I've spent many precious life hours over the last 10 years moving stuff out of my house.  In the last year, the highway of departing clutter has become an absolute speedway.  Here is a lesson I have learned in the process.Lesson Learned #5LastlyAttachments to stuff - does it love you back?I get attached to things.I attach to people and animals as well, but I have a history of loving things ... attaching to them like they have feelings.  Once you start attaching to things, there is a slippery slope you must manage.Here is my slippery slope.Like most people,  I save bits and pieces of things that hold memories for me.  Children's art work, old school papers, a first communion veil, the small worry-stone my son gave me on entering the military, a beautiful greeting card from my daughter with cherished sentiments - just to name a few.  I am fairly successful at managing stuff in this category.  For example, I finally discarded my 56 year old girl scout sash with achievement badges last week.  I wasn't a scout for long, and it wasn't a special time. To this day, \"camping\" or roughing it for me is staying at a Days Inn.  :-)  The sash went out the door las week.  The stuff I own in this category is down to a reasonable quantity.Managing attachments in other areas of my life result in limited success.I give cars names.  My last car was a Maxima.  Her name was Maxie.  I was in tears when I traded her in.  Maxie and I were buds for 10 years.  We got through a lot of bad weather together, but her high-heeled attitude made her designed for speed.   She had a passion for it (notice I didn't say I had a passion for speed - just Maxie!)  At her 10th birthday when she started to burn oil, our trusted mechanic of 35 years could not find the problem.  A fix would have been hard and very expensive. My new car is a Subaru. It (not she, not he) handles the road great in all weather.  It is reliable.  It is transportation.  It does not have a name.  I learned my lesson with Maxie.  And more importantly, I believe the Subaru doesn't care one little bit.  :-)I have a tough time I throwing away pictures.  I am sad when I see old family albums abandoned in thrift or antique shops.  I have many old family albums myself and boxes of pictures, many are duplicates. I also have old family documents - birth and death certificates, military papers, baptismal documents, certificates of achievement, an old driver's license from the 1930s. Not sure what I will do with all of that - right now they are all in one closet.  But these images are staring at me from the end of the long de-cluttering road.  They know I have a soft spot for family history.  They are keeping their collective fingers crossed that they will make the next de-clutter cut in a few weeks.  We shall see.The attachment to my townhouse is strong.  Although I yearn for a smaller place - one with less steps, less extra costs, less upkeep, this home holds all my memories of the last 30 years.  I have lived here longer than anywhere else.  I raised children here.  My mother-in-law died of cancer in my living room.  I remember my son stepping out my front door to enter the military and coming in that same door when he returned.  My daughter recovered here from one of life's black clouds.  My husband stood in the kitchen and told me he would one day go blind.  The house has seen parties for birthdays, anniversaries, weddings.  My mother lived here for 5 years and I watched her decline here. I cried at my kitchen sink the day I knew she would need to move to assisted living.  There were joy filled Christmases - and a few sad ones too, like last Christmas when mom died.   This house is tattooed with my life.  I can't imagine letting another family put their marks on it.  And yet ...How do you avoid attachments to an inanimate building when it feels like more than that?  I will continue to live in and nurture this house for now - and deal with the fall out that will inevitably come later.The topic of minimalism is cluttered with the principles of letting go and living small.    But minimalism discussions sometimes miss the point that stuff can make your life \"more.\"  Yes, less is more, but sometimes things are also more.I think the trick is to pick and choose carefully!  And if you pick and choose everything, then that is when problems start.Keep only what you love ... and what loves you back.I believe my house loves me back!"},

Accepting each others differences made us a great team.But an over abundance of stuff can have a very different outcome.At the far end of the \"stuff\" spectrum is a popular show called The Hoarders.  It always made me a little sad to see these folks who allowed things to overtake their lives so completely.  Their stuff did not make them happy.  They were miserable.  I stopped watching when the show spilled into examples of animal hoarding layered on top of stuff hoarding.  Animals who had died in the house and the owners did not know because the stuff was so mountainous.  Cats who had litters of sick or dead kittens and the owners had no clue.  Sad was one thing.  Disturbing was something else.   I stopped watching.I have never been near the level of clutter as the TV Hoarders.  But this week I was face-to-face with my own personally created clutter monster who was hiding in my yarn room. For newer readers, a little bulleted background on me can demonstrate the problem.I am a knitter.I am a rigid heddle weaver.I am a sometimes fiber spinner.Crafters like me usually have stashes of craft related stuff.  I have a massive large medium small-ish to medium (???)  hoard stash collection selection of knitting yarns, weaving yarns, fiber for making yarns, books, knitting needles, binders of individual patterns, kits (knitting and weaving), many looms, many spinning spindles, and a full size spinning wheel.  (OK, \"massive hoard\" fits - just don't tell my husband.)My hobby once was housed in a small basement closet.  Then it was moved to a small room with closet (we call the den.)  Now it is contained in a moderate size bedroom (we now call \"the yarn room\") with 2 closets that once belonged to my mom.  I sort of maybe have my eye on largest room - our master bedroom.  I wonder if my husband would notice ... oh forget I said anything.I consider my yarn room to be a luxury and a joy.I LOVE LOVE LOVE my hobby.  I think that sets the stage for you.In preparation for painting the yarn room I had to MOVE . ALL . THE . LOVED . STUFF out of the closets and into the center of the floor so the closets could be painted. It took me a whole day.  It filled the center of the room and was stack about 4-5 feet high.  After I finished, I stood back and surveyed the stash.  It did not fill me with joy.  I was agitated.  I was discourage.  How could I allowed something I cherished to fall into the \"too much stuff\" category.I have already started the process of thinning the stash.  There are no ugly items in the room.  But the stash does fall into two categories:  like and love.  The likes are finding their way to new homes where they will be loved.  And I am happy to make space for my loved items. And what is true for my yarn room has been true for the rest of my house.  Space is good.  Less is good. Less stuff is less stress - even if it is yarn."},

This lesson has not been learned from actual experience - just common sense.Yes, these rental storage units serve a short list of purposes.  Temporary storage of household goods between moves or inventory storage for small businesses are two examples that quickly come to mind.  I bet you could suggest a few other good uses as well.But too often families use these units for years to store household items they cannot contain in their home.  Apparently the need for external storage is a growing trend because the sprouting of \"You Store It\" buildings continues to grow.  If there wasn't a demand for this kind of storage, the buildings of this type wouldn't be built.It boggles my mind that folks pay money for these units every month for years to store personal stuff - stuff they don't use and probably don't remember they have.  It is an over-stuffed life for sure.I also scratch my head when I drive by a house with cars that are always parked outside of full garages. Now I am not talking about garages that function extensions of living space - like a place for large exercise equipment or an expansive tool collection with workbenches ... those changes make sense.  People actually use this space.   But folks who leave vehicles ($$$) outside and use their garage as storage for old bikes, boxes of broken and/or discarded toys, old unused refrigerators, old unused kitchen cabinets, party decorations from last New Years, an old kitchen chair with the broken leg, trash, and the like ...  so that there is no room for their cars - well, the garage is protecting the wrong stuff. We have never had a garage or a storage unit.  But about 5 years ago we were floating in a sea of our stuff, my mom's stuff, other inherited stuff and there wasn't one space that was open.  My husband causally suggested that maybe we should rent a storage unit for a while - just to give us some breathing room. Imagine ... paying for breathing room.We did not get that storage unit.  What I did do was reorganize stuff and buy more things like containers to snuggly store our stuff into our current space, giving us the sense of breathing room.  Not actual breathing room, you understand!  Just the appearance of breathing room.Ha!"},

Because I miss my mom every single day, I want her chest to be part of my everyday life - to help me remember what a wonderfully strong and caring woman she was, how her life started out with hope, and the tarnish of her marriage didn't destroy the underlying strength of who she was.Her chest is now open to the air and loved again but this time by her daughter. In this marathon event of seeking to have less but enjoy what remains more ... questions remain.Do I need a chest?  No.Is need and function the only qualities to consider when de-cluttering your life?  No.Will I use and love this piece of furniture all the days of my life?  Yes.It stays."},

This beautiful hand carved and painted Camelot Chess set was created by a wood carver called Whittle Works.  Holy Cow!  These figures haven't seen the light of day in probably 15 years.Gosh!  I still love these!!  Why the heck aren't they out where I can enjoy them? Well, they are now out.  I will tell you why they weren't out.  The set was \"out of sight out of mind\" in a box buried deeply behind a bunch of bad stuff I didn't care one twit about and now does not live here anymore. Some minimalist minded folks would question keeping this chess set.  They would ask:Have you touched this item in the last year?  No.  Not touched or seen in the last 15 years.Do you enjoy playing chess?  No.  I am an embarrassingly bad player.Will you play chess with it in the future?  No.  Not my game.  I prefer Checkers.Do you find beauty or get enjoyment out of this set?  Yes!  End of Story.So, there you go.  The chess set stays.  The bad stuff goes."},

Keeping the lists of subscribed blogs small has been part of my \"smaller is better,\" \"less is more\" change of heart over the last few years.  One blog has been helpful in inspiring me in this direction. Miss MinimalistLiving a beautiful life with less stuffThis blogger and the book she wrote on this subject have been featured in many well known news vehicles such as CNN, BBC, NBC Today, Forbes ... just to name a few.  Certainly there are a large number of excellent web resources on simplifying and minimalism, but Miss Minimalist seems closest to my own middle-of-the-road mindset on the subject.There is one feature I really enjoy.  Each Monday she posts a piece contributed by various followers about their journey to reducing stuff and adopting minimalism.  I love reading about others and the paths they chose for their lives - even if I wouldn't necessarily follow in all their foot steps.  It is amazing how many ways you can approach the minimalist life style.Today I noticed her post was about moving from one residence to another with a minimalist mindset.  How timely!  We have been contemplating the wisdom of making a move to a smaller more senior friendly place the last few months.  That decision is still a big question mark for us.However, as I am cleaning out my own abode - I kept these thoughts in the back of my mind ...Have I used this item in the last year?Would I keep this item if I were moving next week?Would I pay money to pack, transport, and unpack this item?  Would this item be worth the time to wrap and box up ... and unbox and use in a new home?  If the answer was \"no\" to any of these questions ... why would I bother keeping it now?  I have my hands on this item right now.  Does it make sense to keep it and face this decision again at a time when I am actually moving?  Why table this action to discard an item to a time when the stress of an actual move would weigh me down with all the stuff I kept today? And even if I don't move ever again, is it fair to leave this task to the loved ones I leave behind?I will say that going through this downsizing process has been exhausting.  I typically spend about 3 or 4 hours a day working through our possessions, touching and deciding the fate of each item, and then I am just too tired to continue.  I don't make good decisions when I am too tired.  After about 4 weeks of working through this, I am glad I have the luxury to spread it out over time and do it right.  I am very glad I am not facing a pending move with the deadline of a mover's truck at the end of the line.  Now there is a nightmare in the making.If you are going through a similar stage in life - desiring \"less is more\" - then check out the blog Miss Minimalism.  Take the time to window shop through her site.  Pick and choose the topics that interest you.  See if it doesn't crystalize your thoughts about stuff ... and how you want to live with yours.I am currently reading her book, The Joy of Less.  I have found that books on simplification and  minimalism run \"hit or miss.\"  Sometimes it is just a rehash of what you logically already know or what you have read a bunch of times elsewhere.  And to be fair, learning to live more minimally only happens if you can consistently take the actions to make it so.  There is no substitute for changing behavior.  Just reading about it - isn't enough.  These are hard lessons I struggle with regularly.  I will say, however, this book is highly rated on Amazon and so far I would agree with those ratings.  I will report back when I finish the book."},

Since visiting with you last I have not been idle.  In fact, I have been busy to the point of exhaustion as of late. Over the last 8 years, my caregiver focus has been almost totally aimed at my mom.  After her passing in December, it took awhile to get my \"sea legs\" back.  As the list of mom related to-dos dwindled, I had trouble focusing that \"caregiver laser-beam\" on anything else.  I was adrift.  I felt like a gang leader without a gang! (Can you tell I have been watching the violent TV series Sons of Anarchy?  ... which by the way is pretty great!  Sort of like The God Father, but not.)In the last month a major shift of energies and focus blossomed out of me.   Hmm ...  I guess it was more of an volcanic eruption, than the blossoming.I finally focused my \"laser-beam\" around my own house and decided  - Not . Good . Enough .Too much stuff.Too much furniture.Some areas not painted in over 20 years.Some possessions not touched about 10 years.Some possessions overdue a transition to the dump, or Good Will, or to another home.Some repairs and renovations ignored or lived around for way to long.Some items not even mine, for gosh sake.  It is stifling.It weighs me down.Not . How . I . Want . To . Live!!We did some stuff last summer - hardwood flooring and some painting ... but real issues still remained.  So I pulled up my big girl panties and put on rubber gloves - and attacked the real issues of my home head on.  The GoalI want to live lighter ... with less stuff ... with only the things that I love. I want space around me and around the things that I love.Like a ball and chain,I don't want to drag along possessions on the assumption that maybe, possibly, I might need them at some indefinable point in the future.I want to adopt the life style attitude now of \"less is more.\"  When it is time to move to a smaller more senior friendly environment,I want to be ready.  And when my time on this earth is done, I don't want my kids to left with a house full of dusty junk to manage and/or discard.Now I am on a first name basis with the dump guy, a healthy contributor to our local Good Will organization, and many worthy former belongings are now loved by others in their houses.   Summed up at least 40% of our stuff-occupants no longer reside in this house.  We . Have . Breathing . Room!!And the odyssey is not over yet.  In the near-future ...Some cocky \"stuff-occupants\" that made the first cut this go-round, won't be living here come the New Year.  As my husband noted just this morning ... \"It is amazing but despite the mountain of stuff we have moved out of the house, we STILL have a lot of stuff.\"    Not for long, Kemosabe. Not for long!Our kitchen will get a major face lift this summer.Oh ... and there is less dust as well."},
{"title": "My Boys", "date": "Tuesday, March 17, 2015", "text": "Here is a picture of my boys, the cats that share our house with my husband and I.As you can see, they are brothers.  In fact, in the dark sometimes it is hard to tell them apart.  Wally is in the front, and he is pretty much my cat.  Max is behind and he has bonded with my husband.  Max is also the cat who has had degenerative kidney disease (since the age of 3) and we have been giving him subq fluids to combat that condition for 6 years - every other day - and will continue to do so for the rest of his life.  It is what keeps him alive.   What is remarkable about this picture is the following:They are both sitting on the couch with me.  They seldom do that - mostly because our house is usually occupied with 1 to 3 dogs.  When the guest dogs are in residence, our cat-boys pretty much stick to the upstairs.  They do make occasional appearances on the first floor, but never so relaxed.They are sitting side-by-side - almost touching.  When we got this pair, we were looking for a bonded pair.  Our last set of cats had decided to dislike each other and it was an armed camp for several years.  Once burned, we did not want to live like that again.  We wanted the next set of cats to already get along.  We figured brothers who were already friends would work.  And it does, usually.  They play together, they don't fight with each other, but they don't sleep together or groom each other as truly bonded animals sometimes do.  No matter, sometime they \"accidentally\" find themselves sitting together ... making it worth the picture!!I love these two gentle souls.  They are pretty adaptable having lived around dogs all their lives.  It is nice spending time with them alone - without the competition of the 3 grand dogs who think they own the place!!  It is because of my desire to honor their rights to our bed and our bedroom, that when the dogs come to visit, I do not sleep in my bed.  I sleep on the pull out couch or in the guest room in the basement with the canines.   Sometimes I miss my bed, but for these sweet feline faces, I am happy to sleep elsewhere so they can rest comfortably on the second floor when the canine invasion is raging!! After all, these boys are mine and this is their home, and the grand dogs are visitors and are borrowed!"},
{"title": "Insanity is ...", "date": "Monday, March 16, 2015", "text": "\"Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"  Albert EinsteinOh, Albert, how true this statement is.I do some of my best thinking on my walks.  I wonder if Mr. Einstein was a walker.It occurred to me today as I walked that I am moving away from previous insanities.  That is not to say that my old habits were wrong or defective in some way.  No, it just means that methods I used previously never seemed to endure or make lasting improvements for me.  And yet I always fell back on using them when I was \"starting over\" in my quest to improve my health.  It was a kind of insanity.For example: In the past, I diligently recorded exercise statistics:  activities, frequency, repetitions, durations, etc.  It fit my nature to do this, and I assumed it kept me engaged in exercise.  Funny, but the \"engaged\" part never seemed to last as long as I wanted. Today while walking I reflected that I felt pretty good.  The distance, time and speed didn't really matter to me.  What counted was the feedback I was getting from my body that said:  \"enjoying the walk, keep doing this till you are ready to stop, and then repeat again soon.\"  Right then I decided to stop record keeping on my calendar (my history of what I had done) and consider the activity as \"money in the bank\" for the future - improving my freedom of movement for longer into my aging with every step I took.  The change of focus was the difference between looking behind at the past and seeing ahead into the future.I realized the same was true for my stretching/yoga moves.  My body had some stiffness from yesterday's practice that I knew would be relieved by more practice.  In fact, I was eager to get those tiny improvements in flexibility later today ... \"banking\" those improvements so that my future flexibility would keep me moving and nibble. So I am leaving behind an insanity and hopefully finding a lifestyle.  Only time will tell.The only objective indicator I am using now is the step count on my FitBit.  The step count proves I am moving enough each day to avoid some of the bad things in life.  My goal is still 10,000 steps average per day.  Sometimes I get 10,000 steps through my walks, and sometimes I reach the goal through activities in the house.  No matter how I get them, it is movement!  And movement is one of those \"magic pills of health\" that everyone looks for but many refuse to recognize.  The FitBit and me are Buds!! Hope you approve, Mr. Einstein."},

{"title": "Reducing Life Static", "date": "Saturday, March 14, 2015", "text": "There are many blogs on minimalism and simplification.  It is a real movement for sure.  Broadly speaking, the movement to reduce the clutter of life in all its iterations is a desire probably born from our consumer culture where the \"cult of big, better, more\" is still fully in charge.My own journey to reduce what I call \"life static\" has been ongoing for years and feels like it is finally picking up steam today.  It is time for some observations on my current efforts to calm my world down - especially when a big responsibility and focus of life has recently disappeared.It started quietly when I needed to thin out the inherited stuff from the death of a grandmother-in-law and a mother-in-law during the mid 1990s.  Next came the \"newly-adult-children-returning-home chapter,\" so space was made for them.  In mid 2000s my mom moved in with her stuff.  Although I decluttered and decluttered and decluttered over the last 20 years, the stuff continued to increase like rabbits.  I never got ahead.  I just stayed even.  Now the adult children are fully independent, all older adults have passed away, and my decluttering efforts seem to be making a difference.It continues to astound me, however, at the volume of stuff that has passed through my hands in the last 20 years.  I don't remember one single thing that left this house.  Not one single thing. That understanding underlines emphatically just how little we really need to be happy.  Decluttering creates a feeling of lightness, almost like a drug high. It is trite but true - less is more.While decluttering is a big part of my efforts, it is but one small part of my life static picture.Time is precious - more precious to me now than when I was 30.  It is human nature to think there is plenty of time left to do what you want, but no one has a promise of more time than the current moment.  I used to think I would return to work in a fun part time job when mom was gone - now she is gone - no job for me.  No, no, no!  (see a previous post on The Power of No.)  I suspect all retired folks worry about money and if it will last. I am no different. But I would rather adopt a frugal life style than fill my free hours with a job to gain a pay check.  Time is precious.  Time is the goal ... not money.Travel was always on my radar - especially after retirement.  But now my husband is not comfortable with his external environment.  His vision is very very compromised now - what little he has.  And I find I don't miss travel.  I love my home and my life.  I don't need to seek out ways to escape from it like I did when I worked.  It is an interesting evolution I would never have predicted.I dream of less living space.  I love my townhouse.  All 2,000 feet of it has served me well in raising a family, supporting elderly relatives and giving children a safety net while they established themselves in the world.  But my current dream is less house.  And less will definitely be more if this dream is ever achieved.  More on that topic another time.Busyness is way reduced.  My \"to do\" lists still get made, but some days they are never looked at.  Thank goodness there is always tomorrow (hopefully there is tomorrow, but if not, will the \"to-dos\" really matter all that much to me?)  And thank goodness for \"to do\" lists, because once something is on the list I know that it will eventually get done (if there is a tomorrow - but if not - oh well.) Time to think and dream have filled the vacuum left by my mom's death.  Wow, what a concept - time to think.  That still blows my mind. My \"20 years and 20 goals blog theme\" born years ago is now down to a \"20 years and 2 goals blog theme\":  (1) keep fit and healthy, and (2) enjoy living every minute. How's that for symplifying!  Even if my mind starts to fail me like mom's did, I should be able to keep track of 2 goals!!So that is the wrap up for Reducing Life Static.Someday I might even get good enough at this simplifying thingy to get this whole post down to one sentence!!! (ok, maybe not.)"},
{"title": "Inquiring Minds: \"Capturing\" Blog Posts", "date": "Friday, March 13, 2015", "text": "In returning to blogging and visiting blogs this month I decided to make a change in how I am notified of new blog posts from the blogs I follow.In the past, I used a \"blog catcher\" ... most recently Bloglovin'.  Basically I tell Bloglovin' which blogs I follow.  Bloglovin' captures recent blog posts from my list for me.  The blog posts are held on their web site until I am ready to read them.  Once read, the blog posts are automatically removed from my \"To Be Read List.\"  Bloglovin' sends me one daily email reminding me that I have blog posts ready for review.I am sure most blog catcher sites work in a similar fashion.  I have used that method for a long time. Now the problem for me is  ... I seem to get behind on my reading.  When I open up the blog catcher I can have 100 open blog posts waiting for review.  It is can be discouraging.  Sometimes I just mark everything as \"read\" even though I didn't read it.  t know the problem rests partly in my tendency to ignore the daily Bloglovin' reminder ... but when I get an individual blog post directly dropped into my gmail inbox, I don't ignore it.So I am moving over to the \"send me an email\" subscription method for each blog entry posted.  Most blogs offer you the option to subscribe through email.  Initially I was worried that my gmail inbox would be flooded ... but that hasn't happened yet.  Blog posts trickle in daily and are entirely manageable.  And I find I can read a current blog posting far more promptly than before ... at least so far.So what methods have you used ... and what method are you currently using?  Is there another option out there I didn't mention?"},

We burn up our energies with these excitements, and either die early or drop into a lean and mean old age at a time of life which they call a man's prime in Europe. When an acre of ground has produced long and well, we let it lie fallow and rest for a season; we take no man clear across the continent in the same coach he started in--the coach is stabled somewhere on the plains and its heated machinery allowed to cool for a few days; when a razor has seen long service and refuses to hold an edge, the barber lays it away for a few weeks, and the edge comes back of its own accord.

{"title": "The Power of NO!", "date": "Wednesday, March 11, 2015", "text": "During my years as a working person I had one boss (a lovely and caring individual) who coined this statement with her employees.\"The answer is yes.  Now what is the question?\"At the time (12 years ago) I thought it was a catchy statement.  It seemed so positive, so open, so engaging.  And it was something I always remembered it.  I thought it was something to immolate in my own life.  It matched my perception of who I was ... a perky, happy, open and accommodating person.Over the years since that job, I learned that the answer \"yes\" to every question was not necessarily helpful, or truthful or healthy.  I began to wonder if she learned that statement in a management course or book on how to manage teams.  I became more skeptical and resistant to stock statements and catch phrases.  I learned through some difficult life experiences that \"yes\" is not always the best answer.And now as a grouchy older woman I find \"no\" to be the best answer in many situations.  My path from a \"yes\" person to a \"no\" person is not so dismal as you might think.Here are the situations where \"no\" really is the best answer.No, I don't want my home to be filled with too much stuff.  I don't want to struggle finding things that I know I have but can't find.  I don't want to buy a 6th hammer because I can't find the other 5. (sadly not an exageration)No, I don't want to end my life in a wheel chair or bed bound.  I don't want my family to struggle with managing my end of life dibilitation.  I don't want to linger in a marathon of stuggle and pain.  No, I don't want my personal time filled with activities and obligations that I don't enjoy or value.  I don't want to say \"yes\" to requests because it is more socially acceptable to do so.  I don't want my personal time (that is slowly ticking away) filled with others expectations.But really, as the quirkiness of language can sometime show, the \"no\" statements can be restructured into \"yes\" statements.Yes, I do want to get rid of that 6 bags of stuff I decluttered.  I do want to minimize my belongings so that I can find and use them.  I do want to value the things I love without having them buried in stuff I don't.Yes, I do want to keep active, flexible and engaged in life - so I do want to exercise and stretch because I want to keep control of my own life and not abandon that responsibility to my children. Yes, I do want fill my hours with fun, thoughtfulness and happiness, and my perception of what that is exactly is my decision to make - not someone else's.For me \"no\" is a more empowering word.  I learned the value of \"no\" in saying \"yes\" to caregiving. Strange as it seems, I said \"yes\" to a huge responsibility, but \"no\" was where I learned how to stand up for myself and for my mom.  \"No\" to doctors, nurses, social workers, other family members, and religious professionals when I didn't accept their point of view ... \"no\" to administrative types and billing folks .... even \"no\" to my mom when her deteriorating brain failed to serve her well.  It was in those last years I learned that \"no\" was more powerful than \"yes.\"  In fact, I was told several times near the end of mom's life, \"You never gave up on your mother.\"   True.  It was an observation made because I said \"no\" far more than I said \"yes.\"  I really wish I had been wise enough to 12 years ago to challenged that little management \"yes\" statement ... maybe with some carefully worded questions that wouldn't get me fired like ...Can I have a 25% increase in pay?Can I have a corner office?Can I have a 3 hour work day without a cut in pay?I bet I could have massaged a \"no\" from my boss's lips.So - are you more of a \"yes\" person or a \"no\" person?  And don't let my post sway you from your opinion.  The world is filled with \"yes\" people.  And with enough challenge in life they just might graduate to \"no\" people.  Really, all the interesting people in life are \"no\" people.:-)"},

I just wanted to know what my \"normal\" was without focusing on walking.  I discovered that I averaged 6,500 a day in January.  That is my baseline now.  New Goal - Do more than 6,500 average a day during the month of February.  And some day I just might see 10,000 steps again!!In truth, I am pretty far away from my movement goals!  Sadly and embarrassingly so.  For example, I went for a walk today and mostly what I wanted to do during that 30 minutes of walking was find a bench and sit down!  Pathetic ... I was brutal with my self talk. \"Keep those 67 year old feet moving forward you lazy thing, or you will find yourself sitting in your mother's wheel chair ... which by the way is now available.\"  Stuff like that!I did sign up for a Yoga class.  I need to stop walking like an old lady and getting more flexible will help.My HobbiesI have a long love affair with yarn based hobbies.  I have enough yarn in my yarn room (yes, I have a yarn room - doesn't everyone??) enough yarn to knit like a banshie every day until I am 98 years old and never run  out of yarn - even if I stopped buying yarn this very minute for the rest of my life.  (Which, by the way, won't happen ... the not buying yarn part.)  Another embarrassment.  Now I find have the time, the tools and the desire to knit and weave and maybe even spin ... but I also have a little voice in my head that says things like, \"Don't you have something better to do with your time.\"  And then I think hard and I answer myself, \"No, apparently not.\"ReadingI am reading more and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Kindle.  I love zombi books, and end of the world books and stories of destruction (hmmm .... is that healthy?) but can I build a life around reading?And .... ok, pretty much the list stops there.So dear readers, only 3 lonely ideas are bouncing around in my brain (avoidance of wheel chairs, yarn hoarding while listening to the voices in my head, and tales of destruction.)Maybe Psych should be my next doctor visit!!Until next time ...Retired Knitter."},
{"title": "Sleeping with a bar of soap!", "date": "Thursday, January 15, 2015", "text": "Not just any soap! No, I have standards.  I am sleeping with a bar of \"Irish Spring.\"Photo CreditAnd now for the remarkable part of that idea (as if sleeping with a bar of soap isn't odd remarkable enough) ...I am sleeping with a bar of soap on Doctor's Orders!\"Put it between the sheet and the mattress down near your feet.\"Bet you weren't expecting that!!  Even the brand name was recommended.I guess I could just end this blog post here ... just to see if anyone is really reading my posts!But I am not that kind of girl.  :-) I will explain, and who knows, maybe you too may start sleeping with a bar of soap.***Recently in my quest to get caught up on my own health issues, I visited a Podiatrist.  I have a chronic issues over 15 years with my feet.  Mostly I have Plantar Faciitis which probably plagues most of the modern world today. About 7 years ago I stated using prescription orthotics and the foot pain mostly went away.But new pain started recently (like for 2 years or so ... I know, I know ... no lectures please.  I was busy with someone else's body during that time and tabled a lot of the \"me\" stuff) ...  recently with pretty bad leg cramps and terrible terrible foot cramps (the foot cramps were the worst - those suckers would hang around for 30 minutes or so.)  I have had to pull off the side of the road while driving due to foot cramps that threatened to cause a car accident!!So I self-medicated because that was what I had energy for ...bumped up my water - 32 to 64 oz of water a day - bumped up from almost no water at all.increased my potassium - bananas, coconut water, vitamin water, etc.took an over-the-counter product called \"Leg Cramp PM\" - the title says it all, don't you think? It was suggested by a pharmacist.  (I would recommend this product.)These interventions worked some - but the foot cramps were still an issue.And my feet were also starting to get generally sore.So off to the podiatrist!After an examination and a review of what I have already done (including seeing my general doctor for blood work - normal!), she admitted that these kinds of issues were hard to diagnosis.  She recommended creating new prescription orthotics and bumping up my water intake.  Agreed. And that is when the interview sort of went off the rails!She asked me if I had ever slept with a bar of soap.  I considered putting my socks and shoes on and walking out.  Clearly this woman was having a break with reality!  But in that moment  I decided that this line of questioning would be good fodder for a blog post!  (Yes, guys, I am always thinking of you.)I think my reaction was pretty normal ... eyes unblinking, jaw slightly open, quiet, assessing how far I was from the exam room door ...  and she had the good grace to laugh sort of self-deprecatingly, and then she plowed on with her story.She read an article on this phenomenon of sleeping with a bar of soap and quickly dismissed it (so thankfully she is not a quack.)  But then she started having patients report spontaneously to her success with cramping using the bar of soap method.  And not just a few patients either, but a substantial number.  So now she suggests it - even though it is still an \"old wives\" tale in her mind.  She says sometimes it is discovered that old wives tales have a thread of truth. So last night I slept with a bar of soap!  Irish Spring as prescribed.  Not a great success for me.  If I do start getting success, you can be sure that I will buy a case load of Irish Spring and start taping them to my legs, the peddles of my car, the side of my couch and maybe grind up a soap powder to put in my shoes.  But no success thus far, so I am saved at present from having my own \"break with reality.\"  :-)Tonight I will try 2 bars of soap.  Maybe ...This morning I googled this topic to see what the \"experts\" have to say, and I found this link.  Interesting reading.So my question to you is this ...Do you have leg and foot cramps?  What do you do to prevent it?  Have you slept with a bar of soap?(Enquiring minds want to know!!)"},

{"title": "The Caregiver takes off her mantle ...", "date": "Sunday, January 11, 2015", "text": "Not much time has passed since my mom passing.  Looking over that short period I find that I am a little surprised.I miss her, but I am not mourning her!  And I feel there is a big difference between those two words.Maybe I should explain.I heard all the well meaning sympathies - all offered by people who care for me and shared their best advice from their own experiences and expectations.Take your time with recovering ...Only time will help this process ...Don't try to do too much ...I am worried for you because she was so much a part of your life ...Those daily little reminders of her life will be difficult to get passed ...And these statements are all generally true, but how can I explain not mourning my mother now.Today on my walk I realized that my mourning began long before she died.Thinking back I mourned her in a million small ways over the last 10 years.  The first tug on my heart happened when I realized she was really no longer completely viable living independently.  Moving her into my home 8 years ago made me happier - she was safer - but I remember sadness too knowing she needed this kind of help.  In 2011 her frequent hospitalizations and in-house rehabs created another jarring realization. Yes, her mind was failing, but her body was too.  In December 2011  I remember standing by my kitchen sink crying like she had already died - she was leaving my home and being admitted into Assisted Living.  Watching her leave me mentally and physically this last year was a terribly mournful time for me.    I mourned at each and every decline for too many years.So I am not in a state of mourning today.  It sounds almost sacrilegious to say that.  But for me, my time at my mom's side was like one long goodbye.  And as I lost pieces of her through the years, I mourned and made my peace with those losses every step of the way.I miss her.  I am not mourning her.  I think she would be happier about that. I think each individual goes through the process of losing a loved one differently.  I had years and years of little goodbyes and periods of sadness and mourning.  There is nothing left now to mourn.***I have two last memories to share - and then I am moving on in a different direction for the blog.About 4 days before mom died, she had a few wakeful periods.  She was not eating or drinking much.  She was not speaking.  I knew she was dying.  I think she knew too.  That morning when I came into her room I bent down to say good morning and kiss her face - something I did every time I visited.  This time, however, she slowly lifted her arm and put it around my head as I kissed her.  Her message was simple - I am saying goodbye.  I will remember that embrace for the rest of my life.  That same day my sister arrived and mom did exactly the same thing again.  A simple action and yet so meaningful.My last memory caught me by surprise.  I expected her actual death to be hard.  I was prepared.  I was not prepared for the last moments at her grave site.  The priest had performed the last blessing and had left.  It was a cold and rainy day - too dismal to linger.  The small gathering was breaking up.  At that moment, I couldn't seem to leave.  I finally walked to the end of her casket and placed my hand on it trying hard to understand this emotion.  I think the realization that I was finally no longer needed even for the shell of her body had finally hit me.  I turned quickly and left.I left my caregiver mantle at her grave site.  I didn't need it any more.***Next time I post ... and there will be a next time ... I will focus on what the \"new\" me is doing!  Hopefully you will stick around for that."},

My time at your side began 8 years ago when you moved into my home.  Neither of us fully understood how difficult this last journey would be.  Thankfully we didn't dwell on what could happen.  Life is a process and we just kept moving forward through it.You were there during my growing years when living in a dysfunctional family was very hard - and I was there during your declining years when increasing age took so much away from your joy of living.  There is no one I have shared more of life's struggles with than you.  Through it all you showed how to keep moving forward through the hard stuff while still enjoying the simple pleasures.  I feel so much in your debt.I am changed by this whole experience.  How remarkable is it that my personal plans and desires could be so dramatically altered by taking this journey with you.  Nothing I could have imagined for myself would have equaled the the importance of what I learned at your side.   The real diamonds of life are time with family and giving of yourself when it would be easier to walk away.  I wasn't born knowing that stuff - learned it from caring for you.   Oh, the last 8 years were not without our personal disagreements.  Those bumps in the road were rocky at times.  But it never derailed you and me.  I lived the last 8 years knowing this day would come when you would be gone.  I worried that I would look back and wonder ... could I have done more or something different.  My motto became - Have no regrets!  I have looked back.  There was nothing left undone or unsaid between us.  I loved you, mom, without reservation or conditions.  I accepted your strengths and weaknesses and learned from them.  I met every challenge and pushed every boundary on your behalf.  No regrets.  I am now at peace.I know you would be happy to know I am fine today.  Sometimes missing you suddenly catches me unawares and the tears begin to fall, but that is normal.  You have moved on and so must I. Thus we part company in this life. You are loved, mom.  You still hold a place in my heart that no one will ever dislodge.  You were there when I took my first breath at birth and I was there for your last breath in death. I hope when I take my last breath, you will be there with that sweet smile to help me find my way.Love you always,ElaineRetired Knitter"},
{"title": "Hello again!", "date": "Thursday, January 8, 2015", "text": "It is probably safe to assume that I am talking to myself in this post especially after such a long absence from blogging.  That is ok.  That is how this blog started out.  Just me and my keyboard.The last six months have been hard.  Maybe I didn't blog because my focus was aimed at just putting one foot in front of the other ... day after day.  Or maybe I lost my blog mojo.  Just don't know.Here is a snap shot view of how I spent my \"blogging break\" - similar to the school child's assignment of \"What I did last summer\" only less enjoyable.In July Meathead, my dear dear grand dog died, without warning.  He was a very old bull dog and we knew his days were numbered, but it was a shock.  I still feel that loss deeply.In August Grimace, my other dear grand dog, developed a series of seizures that took some time to get under control.  Probably not epilepsy.  Probably a mass or lesion.  He is doing fine for now.  I treasure my time with him.In September Milo, yet another dear grand dog, developed spinal issues causing weakness in his rear legs.  Left uncorrected, he would become paralyzed.  He was scheduled for two surgeries - one in November for air way obstructions, typical of pushed-in-face breeds, and one in December for his spine. He is doing well.And then the most intensive loss of all began to develop.  In November my mother began to fail ... sleeping all the time with loss of appetite and weight loss.  She died in December, just after Christmas.  That loss is beyond measure.So it goes without saying that I am pretty much physically and emotionally spent. I will do one last Through My Caregiver Eyes post at some point later this month to honor my mother and to close out that long series of posts.  Beyond that it is too soon to know if or when I will be back to blogging.  I need to figure out how to live in my own life and not inside my mom's life.If you are reading this post, I thank you for visiting."},

{"title": "Prep work begins - the kitchen.", "date": "Tuesday, July 1, 2014", "text": "I have to get better at doing before and after pictures.  There are no before pictures in this posting.  Sorry.In preparation for new floors and painting this month, I began a thorough clean out of all areas.  Decluttering of stuff has been a happy, positive activity for me.  I always feel lighter and more content when I am reducing the \"stuff-layer\" of my life.  Clear open spaces are less stressful. A related goal is to free up floor space by moving a few pieces of furniture out.  We have too many road blocks for a person with visual limitations.With home improvement contractors arriving in 2 weeks,  the time is right to declutter.I started with a small problem area of my kitchen.Imagine a 3 foot high by 5 foot long shallow 3 shelf book case along this wall.  It was filled with cookbooks and animal foods.  The top held baskets of clutter-catchers.  Try to imagine why someone who does not enjoy cooking would have 5 1/2 feet of cookbooks.So I emptied the shelves of everything putting it on the table and dragged the bookcase to the basement.  It will go to a new home or the dump - which ever comes first.  Now I have this lovely clear floor space.  And when the walls are painted, who knows what will hang on the walls.  Maybe nothing.Of course, now I had a table full of stuff.  Hmm.... I gave half of the cookbooks to Good Will.I then turned to the pantry.  A \"pantry purge\" was in order.  It is a small space, but once I cleared out the expired items, the duplicates and the stuff that I never use, 2 spaces were clear:  the top shelf and the floor. The top shelf now holds my essential cookbooks. (Still considering if they are all really \"essential.\"  I think not!)  I hate the stacking of books on top of books.  But the remaining books will need a more careful review before I get rid of any of them. The floor holds the animal foods (dog food and bird seed.) Some canned and boxed foods are housed in our basement.  I don't understand why 2 retired people like us need that many food items.  But that is another problem for another time - food hoarding!  I am sure that \"hoarding\" is not quite the right term, but my habit of buying extra of things that I find on sale is counter productive if the items expire and I throw them away. In theory, I love the idea of a nice large pantry close to the cooking area, but the reality is that I don't preserve home grown foods and I have easy access to a grocery store.  So the fact I even have a pantry is a luxury.  When I was growing up, we didn't have a pantry - just found space in the limited cabinets to hold canned and packaged foods.  I guess the expansion of large pantries and multiple kitchen cabinets is an extension of the growing sizes of houses in the 20th Century - and our habit of acquiring lots and lots of stuff.I am very pleased with this one kitchen solution right now.  My eat-in kitchen is fairly small and adding a bookcase years ago was a bad idea.  It just ate up floor space and encouraged stuff gathering.Of course the next step is to box all this up and move it to the basement - because the whole area will be painted - but that is 3 weeks off so I have time."},
{"title": "So it begins ... the carpet requiem", "date": "Monday, June 16, 2014", "text": "After almost 30 years we are finally replacing the carpeting in the main part of our townhouse.  The contract is signed and within the month, we will see this carpet ripped out and carried out the door.Yes, this carpeting is 29 years old in July of this year.  It is the original carpeting that the builder put in and it was the best thing we chose when we selected options for our new town home those many years ago.Many vendors who have passed down this hallway (carpet installers and professional carpet steam cleaners) have told us this is excellent carpeting ...  that you can't buy this quality carpet today no matter how expensive you go because carpet manufacturers don't want you to have carpet that lasts 30+ years!!  Planned obsolesces, they call it.It is silly, but I get attached to \"things\" - things that have served me well and that I have owned and used for a long time.  And this stupid carpet is one of those \"things.\"  I didn't shed any tears when we replaced the xyz things (refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, front door, glass door sliders, storm door, washer/dryer, water heater, roofing, deck, bathroom flooring, toilets, bathroom sinks, furniture ... it is an extensive list ), but for some crazy reason, pulling the carpet out makes me a little sad.But everything wears out and this carpet is ready to go to \"carpet heaven.\"  After all, it has been walked on, run on, spilled on, peed on, vomited on - you name it ... it has happened.  Even red wine.  It all came out - there is not one visable stain or wear path, but I can't get it really clean any more ... down below the rug surface into the pad where it really counts, and on humid days ... well, you get the idea.The replacement?? ... No more rug for us.  Hard wood floors!  And it will be a dirty, noisy, intrusive  job for about 2 days.  Upstairs hall way, two and half flights of stairs and the first floor area - all hard wood.  No more hidden areas I can't clean.And when they complete the flooring job, we are contracting to paint about 60% of the interior of the townhouse.  So the *#@%$ \"fun\" will just continue.  But it has been almost 20 years since we painted and that is also long over due too.  May as well get all the pain out of the way at one time!I feel pressured to move forward with these jobs ... they are well passed due by many years and I now have this window of time without a mom-related emergency.  Really, for the last 7 or 8 years I stalled at doing anything ... couldn't handle \"just one more thing, don't want to disturb mom, too tied up with her assisted living care, need to focus on nursing home transition, etc. etc. etc.\"But now the environment of my house is causing me stress and it is a problem I can do something about. All I need to do is write the check! Oh, yes, the check!  There is another stressor!  These folks don't work for free.  But no matter.  It has to be done.

Exhausting.I still can \"dive into\" a mom-related crisis with the energy and the focus of someone half my age, but the personal price that is paid after the crisis gets longer and longer to recover from.  I can't seem to \"dive out\" with the same energy and focus and take back my own priorities without a long hard fight with myself.Here I am 3 months later finally getting re-connected with my own needs ... but it seems like such an effort!But I am trying ... really, really trying!  Two weeks ago I prepared a blog post and pictures, but never posted it!  Does that still count?I gained an all-time-high of body mass ... yes, too much weight!  I am back to watching my food intake and have thankfully settled back to my previous \"all time high of body mass.\"  *sigh* Does that count?I started walking and exercising but have missed the last week and a half.  Does the start of walking count?I have started calling home improvement vendors to replace carpeting and flooring (long, long, dreadfully long overdue.)  But I dread the total upheaval that this kind of improvement will cause in my personal space.  No contracts signed yet, but will the effort of talking to someone about making improvements actually count?I am knitting on a shawl for myself that I really don't care for - I bought the kits over 10 years ago.  Too bad I didn't make the shawl then when I loved the colors. No matter.  It came from deep stash and I thought I would come around when I got into it.  I didn't! I am almost finished so I can use it this fall in the house.  Certainly that finish object should count?My other crafting lives are in another temporary limbo - that always seems to happen when I am in recovery.  Nothing there will count.

I love walking into my yarn room and admiring my newly  assembled loom and stand with the newly started weaving project on it.  That counts for something.)I returned to knitting group three weeks ago and enjoyed every moment, but felt like I was stealing time from other more worthy endeavors - like sitting on the couch and doing nothing!  Ok, now we all can agree that knitting group does count!!!On the surface of my life everything looks under control.  But under the surface ... I am still struggling.  And I dread the thought that any gains I make will go up in smoke when mom takes her next downward step in living.This \"Recovery\" stuff is hard hard work!"},
{"title": "Through My Caregiver Eyes - Light", "date": "Monday, May 12, 2014", "text": "So yesterday my post seemed only to see the shadows of mom's mind.  Today I witnessed some of the light.  I thought I would share.It was a beautiful morning when I arrived at the Nursing Home, and she was happy to see me.  She seemed more alert than yesterday. She asked for ice cream, but what she really wanted was a glass of water with ice.  Swallowing fluids is generally difficult now and all liquid are thickened for her.  Icy cold water was what she wanted without the thickening so I got her exactly that.  She enjoys the simple things in life now ... and a large glass of water with ice sipped slowly through a straw was do-able for her today.But I did notice that picking words and completing sentences was hard today (ice cream for ice water is a prime example.)We had a perfect day so we went out the front of the community and sat in the sun.   She remained alert enjoying the warmth of the sun.  So different from yesterday.  Yet not so different as communication was a struggle.Soon a priest emerged from the entrance.  He recognized us and stopped to talk with mom.  It was a bit hard for mom, but this priest is a regular visitor and very skilled at interacting with all ranges of cognitive ability. He was from New York and so was mom, so we chatted about that for a few minutes.At one point, he directed a question to mom.  \"So, Mrs. Mesavage, how old are you?\"  Mom continued to smile at him but did not respond.  I thought maybe she didn't hear the question.  I regularly repeat questions aimed at mom with a slightly raised voice - making sure she can see my mouth.  I began to repeat the priest's question.Before I could get passed the second word, mom turned to the priest and said,\"Can I lie?\"What a hoot!!Not only was she following the conversation, not only did she have an answer ... a spark of her personality and humor emerged in a blinding flash of light for me.  I felt totally washed in it.  She was connected for that small period of time.  She continued to give the priest a dazzling smile waiting for his answer.  He laughed right out loud.  \"Sure, why not!\" he said. She responded, \"I am 81.\"81???She is actually 88 - and maybe she couldn't remember her actual age, but my guess is that she did know for those few moments!  Of course, she probably didn't want too big a lie to answer for in the next life so she just shaved her age a bit.  :-)  And seriously, if the priest said she could lie, should she need to answer for anything at all???Too funny!Now if it was me, and I was going to lie to a priest, I would have made it a whopper!\"I am 29!!!\"Thank God for the spots of light.  It makes her not seem so far away!"},

I needed to open the envelope for her.Today was a day for sun shine and flowers and cookies and a card!  Today was a day I had hoped the  shadows of her brain might clear a bit so she could enjoy this day.  But it was not to be.  She was happy to see me as I got a small smile on my arrival.  She briefly enjoyed the flowers I brought and she munched on a red sprinkled sugar cookie cut in the shape of a heart. But recognition of the holiday seemed lost on her.We went outside to enjoy the sun shine - spending time in the center's gazebo is one of the things she likes to do.  But she promptly fell asleep.  Sleep seems to be her constant companion.  I have come to accept this.  It is enough that we spend time together.Time to sit and think fills my visits.  My thoughts were interrupted by another family nearby.  They were sitting together with a grandmother in a wheel chair, and I could overhear them encouraging her.  She needed to work hard in PT and to eat all her meals and to not spend all her time in bed.  If she wanted to go home she needed to do these things ... otherwise she could not go home. Such sadness I felt.  How many countless times I had that very same conversation with mom over our years together.  I tried to block out their voices.  Better to stay focused on the knitting I brought ... no sense in borrowing sadness when I had plenty of my own.Shadows of the gazebo.I looked up and saw the shadows of the gazebo about our heads.  How very much like the shadows of mom's brain that gazebo is - small spots of light and darkness.  When mom was admitted to the nursing home 6 weeks ago there were far more bright spots in her brain.  Lately the darkness seems to be gaining ground.So on this Mother's Day I honor the woman my mother is!  She didn't have the easiest life but she raised her two daughters to be productive and caring members of society.  She held together her small  dysfunctional family when others might have given up.  She lived a long life with many satisfying and loved filled moments.  She might not remember any of this, but I do.She does not suffer now.  She lives a calm life not disturbed by the loss of possessions and experiences.  For her Mother's Day is just like any other day.  It is as if her losses have been exhausted now - there is nothing more left for her to lose.The Mother's Day card sat unopened on her lap.  She fell asleep while looking at the cover of the card.  I guess the warmth of the sun put her to sleep ... or maybe another bright spot is shrinking into shadow.You are loved on this Mother's Day, mom."},

But I am knitting a little each day.  And when I do force myself to knit those few rows each day - I do feel better afterwards.  CLEANINGThis was a pretty simple goal - clean two closets.  It did not happen, and now the rest of the house is in a desperate state of dirty!  Usually when I am upset I become a cleaning machine!  Not this time.  My energy levels are very very low, so I am not going to fret about a dirty house.  BLOGBlog more ... was my goal.  Blogging has always helped me - especially when things have been difficult with mom.  The story of my mom and care giving continues.  I did blog a bit more.  But I don't want this blog to become only my care giving journey - so I will try to broaden my focus going forward.  EXERCISEDo more strength and stretching exercises.  This was the goal.  While totally worthwhile, it has been really hard right now.  No time, no energy, no immediate feedback - like walking gives - to make the effort right now possible.  I haven't lost my desire.  I'll be back. My April Goals!Walk more!Sleep better!Settle mom in her new environment!"},
{"title": "Through My Caregiver Eyes - Unfamiliar Faces", "date": "Monday, April 7, 2014", "text": "As I walk into the nursing center every day to visit mom ... (and it has been about 10 days now) ... I can never predict how the visit will go.  The face of my mother seems little different each day since the hospitalization.Sometimes it is her contented face I see - happy to see me and other residents.  She gives a brilliant smile to everyone who addresses her.  At other times it is her sleepy face - asleep in her wheel chair for most of the visit.  She expresses no interest in her surroundings, no desire to eat, and only wants to nap.Today another face greeted me.  She had rolled herself up to the nursing station and appeared to be looking around.  She recognized me as I approached, but the look was that of inquiry.  \"Where were you?\"  \"I am ready to go home now.\"  \"I think we need to go back home today.\"  \"It is time go to see Walter.\"  (Walter is her brother who lives in New York.  She hasn't seen him for longer than I can remember.)The focus today was \"home.\"  It entered most of our conversations.  \"Home\" sometimes means her room - but not today.  \"Home\" might have been her assisted living bedroom or it might even have been my \"home.\"  Regardless - the only home she has now is her nursing home room - and that definitely was not where she wanted to go today.She was restless and irritable as the visit progressed.  At one point she stopped and looked around asking for me or my sister.  She wanted to know if we were still here.  I was sitting right in front of her.  She asked about home again.  She understood that she could not stand now without assistance from 2 people - but she couldn't make the logical leap to understand that her limitations made this environment the only choice for now.It was a hard day.And so I suspect I am seeing the many one-dimensional faces of advancing dementia -  unfamiliar faces that are rising to the surface as we discover what mom's new normal is.  And it is very apparent that she has both a new lower norm physically and mentally.I miss the familiar face of the woman who raised me.  She was interested in her surroundings and the activities of her friends and family.  She was consistently friendly even when she was having a bad day.  She'd occasionally ask if she could go home - but she followed the logic that my house had too many steps - that her wheel chair would not work there - and she was safer in Assisted Living.    She had a multi-dimensional personality - even as she continued to decline.I miss that woman more than I can express.I fear that familiar face will not show itself again.Another loss.The losses never seem to end.But I am thankful she is still in this life with me - no matter what face she is showing.  I know our days together grow few.  I will love all those unfamiliar faces that rise to the surface now - even the difficult ones ...... because someday I might not even have those."},
{"title": "Through My Caregiver Eyes - Nursing Home", "date": "Thursday, April 3, 2014", "text": "How to begin.My mom was never one to express preferences in life.  She usually went along with life - adjusting to whatever was put in her path without much resistance. With one exception!She never wanted to be placed in a nursing home. Today she sits in a nursing home - because her physical and mental abilities do no permit her to continue in an assisted living environment.  She is getting physical and occupational and speech therapies ... and it is hoped that this caring environment will help repair the damage to her dementia that that hospitalization caused. It is hoped.But as I look back over the last 7 or 8 years of being there while she aged - it breaks my heart to know she is now in a nursing home.I console myself with the knowledge that this nursing home, Brooke Grove Rehabilitation and Skill Nursing Center, is an excellent facility.  This retirement community is number 1 in the county and in the top 5 in our state.  I have been there with her through several rehabilitations 2 years ago and during this admission as well.  The staff is very stable - with many of them remembering her from other times.  And since her hospital discharge she has improved markedly because the environment is very much less stressful. When I am feeling very down, I remind myself of those facts.But how do I overshadow some of the memories from the hospital ...One memory is burned in my brain.  It brings tears to my eyes even now.  After one especially difficult and frightening hospital procedure my sister and I returned to the room and found mom quietly very upset - trembling.  We stood on either side of her bed - trying to be there for her.  I don't recall if she was aware of our presence, but she pulled the covers up and began performing the sign of the cross on her person.  She silently repeated the sign of the cross over and over again. In her mind there was no other help for her except God.I felt helpless. My own belief in God is less traditional than mom's and certainly not as intense.  But in that moment I desperately hoped that the spirit of God was standing by her with us.  She deserved at least that much.Today her medical record has an order ... no ambulence transports, no hospitalizations.Finally I have found the silver lining of dementia  ...  hope that dementia has lost that memory in her brain.Now I must find a way to cope with that memory in my brain."},
{"title": "Through My Caregiver Eyes - Hospitalization", "date": "Friday, March 21, 2014", "text": "Short note - she is hospitalized!Mom's rash continued to grow and spread and generally make her miserable.  All efforts to treat seemed to fail.  Finally she was hospitalized last Tuesday with the intent that an Infectious Disease Physician take control of this condition and aggressive treatment started.Carbuncles is the initial diagnosis.  IV antibiotics and a surgical lancing of one of the boils has been ordered.  She is on pain patches and morphine.  It has been a difficult time.My days are now consumed with her care once again. I am with her from early morning until evening.  She is too weak to stand or even to adjust her position in bed.  She is too weak to feed herself.  Her pain medicine is a mercy but also a poison to her health.  Without the morphine she has bad pain, with the morphine she has some relief but sleeps the entire time which only continues to weakens her.  And even when she was healthy, she could not respond to questions of the doctors so I become her voice. Although hospitalization is meant to focus and intensify the process of disease identification and treatment ... vigilance becomes the caregiver's main job.  Nurses are busy people.  They don't have time to meet every need.  They cannot note every change.  And they can't come when needed if the person can't remember to push the Nurse Button.  I become her hands.And when ordered tests conflict with the current needs of the patient, you have to step in and say \"no.\" Early in the admission mom's ability to void stopped.  A catheter was ordered - but not immediately done.  And then after a time transport arrived to take her for additional testing in the hospital - and I flipped.  The poor transport guy must have thought I was nuts when I said she wasn't going anywhere until her bladder was drained and I went to find the nurse.  I made her aware that everything - including testing would be halted until she put in mom's catheter.  She complied.  Mom's pain was reduced by half.All these people mean well, but they only see their little part of the process. Vigilance! My time is now not my own.  Blogging will cease for now.If you are a praying person, I ask for your prayers.  Hospitalization, while sometimes necessary, often negatively impacts the patient who is 88 and can start a downward slide that cannot be controlled."},
{"title": "Through My Caregiver Eyes - a quick update", "date": "Saturday, March 8, 2014", "text": "It is amazing to me that mom has been relatively stable with no serious issues for over 2 years.  It shows what good professional monitoring can do in an excellent retirement community.  True, it isn't home, but at home mom was hospitalized 4 times in one year with many rehabilitations ... all ending in admission to Assisted Living ... so they must be doing something right that I wasn't doing!The last few weeks, however, have been worrisome.  She developed a rash on her left leg that increased in size and intensity very very quickly - despite several medical interventions.  When I say it is intense, the center portion is like an open wound.  And the whole rash is extremely painful.  Last week another similar rash started to develop on her right leg.  By mid-week, there was a place on her back that appeared to be cooking up the same rash. I started making noises with the medical staff about what I thought she needed a week ago - before the spread to her back.  This community stellar in many respects, but ... they are a bit slow to family observations and recommendations.  I understand that they deal with many families who think they know what is best.  No matter.  This lady is the only mother I will ever have ... and I have been proven correct with regards to her medical care many times.I think, however, we are finally on the same page.Yesterday my sister and I took mom off site to a dermatologist for a tissue biopsy - in an effort to clearly identify the problem and make sure the treatment is correct.  It was an exhausting and painful visit for her.  It was exhausting and painful for me too. Now we wait! Unfortunately results aren't instant and cultures take time.  But at least I feel we are taking the right steps. AND, thankfully I feel confident in the Dermatologist we visited.  I know she must report back to the medical staff at mom's Assisted Living, but when I asked if she would call me back directly with results as well, she quickly responded, \"I will be calling you first to discuss treatment.\"This doc is a \"keeper.\""},

{"title": "Through My Caregiver Eyes - Are you paying attention?", "date": "Tuesday, February 18, 2014", "text": "It sometimes amazes me how much of life goes by unnoticed.Oh ... I am not talking about the big stuff - big stuff is generally seen and sometimes promptly dismissed or forgotten.  But big stuff hits your personal radar - usually.No, I am talking about the small, the inconsequential, the minor details that sometimes barely touch our consciousness.  The kind of little red flags that seem to grow slowly over the years, becoming common place and accepted ... and limiting.   Here is an worrisome example in my mom's life and mine ...Watching mom over the last 7 years, I realized the simple act of getting out of bed was getting not so simple for her.  In the final months at my home we had to install bed bars - not to protect her from falling - but to give her a hand hold for pulling herself up with her arms to get out of bed.  Now in assisted living, she has a bed strap that she grabs to help with rising or adjusting herself in bed.Her torso muscles - those \"core\" muscles we hear so much about - aren't used for the function of rising out of bed anymore.  She uses her arms to do the work.  And last week, as I was sitting beside her - she in her recliner and reclined - she tried to get up but collapsed back.  She couldn't sit up.  She wanted me to lift her forward.  I reminded her she could adjust the recliner electronically with the touch of a button to help her sit up.  And she did.None of this is news.  For her this is \"normal\" now.  Accepted. It didn't happen over night, however.  At some point in the past she must have noticed more of a struggle to do the simple action of rising from bed.  Or maybe not.  Maybe she wasn't paying attention. But here is the \"bone shivering\" part of the story for me.One morning about a month ago I was laying in bed and I started to sit up.  I promptly rolled back down. The first effort was a \"fail.\"  On my second try, I was successful.  It took a bit of an effort and I didn't seem to remember that effort in the past.  But as I sat on the side of the bed I thought, \"Not good.  Not good at all.\"  Visions of my mother floated through my head. I vainly tried to explain away the episode to myself as I looked in the bathroom mirror and brushed my teeth that morning.  Years ago I was instructed by a physical therapist to always roll on my side and push my torso up with my arms when getting out of bed.  And I dutifully have done that for about 10 years to help with back pain. But what has that small action resulted in today?  What will getting out of bed look like in 10 or 15 years?  Will there be a strap hanging off the bed post to help pull me up?Since that morning I added some core exercises to my routine.  At first those exercises just K*I*L*L*E*D me!!  Many unrelated muscles from my neck down to my knees tried to help with those core exercises to spare my abs from working.  Those lazy suckers just didn't want to work at all!  But I am nothing if not stubborn!Recently the exercises seem easier to do.  There is an improvement in some things that abs are supposed to help with ... functions that were slipping and I hadn't noticed yet.   And now I can get out of bed without the use of my arms (unless the back muscles are cranky.)I am not going for a flat belly or a \"rack\" ...  the usual goal of most doing core exercises.  I just want to get out of bed without help when I am 85. We all share an aging journey.  But each of us moves through these years differently.  I am aiming for a different journey than my mom.  And the only way I can do that is if I am paying attention - to her and to me."},
{"title": "My first sweater", "date": "Saturday, February 8, 2014", "text": "I follow a blog called Carolyn Knits.   The writer, Carolyn, is a knit designer and a friend of my cousin.  Stop by her blog for a visit.  You won't be sorry. One of her posts looked back at older completed projects, evaluating the the pluses and minuses.  I left a comment on her blog about my first sweater.  I thought it might be a good thing to write about on my blog sometime ... and then promptly forgot about it.Carolyn didn't forget!  And when I introduced my new yarn room, she reminded me of this topic.So here we go with the story of my first sweater - a sweater that I would never ever give away, but can only wear in the privacy of my own home.An indoor shot so the color is not quite right.The sweater construction is simple.  Crew neck cardigan with drop shoulders created in pieces - meaning for this project there is a large back, a left front, a right front, and two sleeves - with an added button band.  Once all the pieces are knitted separately, they are hand sewn together.  Blocking usually is done before the sewing.  For my non-knitter readers, blocking means that the garment pieces are dampened, the items are than placed on a blocking board, spread out to fit the measurements, pinned in place and left to dry.  Blocking helps hand knitted items look more finished and assures that the sizes are correct before sewing.The first thing you notice is this sweater is gi-normous!  Really, I could fit two of me into it.  The second thing - that probably only regular knitters would notice if they saw the garment in person - is that the right front and the left front don't match all that well.Without rolling up the sleeves, they fall over my hands.So what went wrong that this sweater is so wonky.  A couple of major mistakes caused this result.  First of all I didn't check gauge.  Gauge is making sure before casting on for the project that the number of stitches per inch and row made by the knitter matched the guidelines of the pattern.  If they don't match correctly, then bigger or small needles should be used until you get the right gauge.  Without the right gauge, you have no idea what size the finished garment will be.Typical me - at that time - decided that I was using the correct yarn and the needle size they suggested so all would be well.  I also didn't measure myself to determine which size sweater I should knit.  I didn't check the measurements offered by the sweater pattern.  I remember thinking that I like my clothes loose so the large size would be just fine. Famous last words.I was a new knitter, I was eager to get to the actual knitting and the preliminary stages and planning just seemed so boring and unnecessary.   So I jumped in and began knitting.Each piece began with a ribbed hem knitted on smaller needles.  Once the rib was completed you changed to larger needles.  All was well as I completed the back.  I charged ahead to knit the right front panel.  Still everything was going gang-busters!  Onward to the left front panel.   Before you knew it the second panel was done.  Looking at the sweater you can see that the body stitches are a lot of knitting - especially when you have chosen the large size.At that point I stopped and held the back piece up to my body.  Hmm ... seemed kind of big.  I held up one of the fronts.  Yes, it was pretty darn big.  I began to rethink that skipped step of doing a gauge swatch.  But I had poured so much time into these 3 pieces, I had no intention of stopping now. And then I made a terrible discovery.  The left and right front panels were not the same size.  Yikes!  What the heck happened?  Then I remembered that when I knitted the rib hem of the second front panel, I didn't change up to the bigger needle to complete the piece.  The size difference was considerable ... like about 3 inches in length and 2 inches in width.  Holy Crap!  Now what.Well, the experienced knitter in me today knows the answer - you rip out the second panel and do it again correctly.  The inexperienced knitter of 1997 would no more rip out all that knitting than cut off her arm.Then the light dawned.  I would block the second panel bigger to match the first panel.  Just stretch it out to fit!  Yes ... problem solved.And it did stretch out to match length and width, but it made the actual knitted fabric thinner - giving one side more drape than the other.  Sort of a floppy side.And, of course, when I put the fully finished sweater on - it was HUGE!I really like the buttons.  :-)Oh well.  It was a major learning experience.  I now always do a gauge swatch - sometimes several.  If I make a major mistake, I rip it out.  If I don't like it while it is being knitted ... if the error is visible or the quality not acceptable, I won't like it any better a year from now - and the item won't get worn.Now I will say, I do wear this sweater occassionally.  It covers anything I have on. (I could probably wear all the clothes I own layered under it.)  :-)  It is warm and ... it is my first sweater.  It reminds me that the preplanning for a project really is important - and now after so many years, I really enjoy the prep.And when I am not feeling well, it is the perfect sweater.  It seems to envelop me in warmth and it make me feel cozy."},
{"title": "The shawl that almost whipped my butt", "date": "Thursday, February 6, 2014", "text": "One of my goals for this month is to complete one of the three very large knitting projects that are currently outstanding.  The story of this shawl is so typical of me ... but I will share it anyway!Picture from RavelryIn March of 2013 I let my daughter loose inside a knitting pattern book.  She picked a shawl she liked called the Lace Leaf Shawl.  I jumped in as I usually do and said, \"Sure I can make that for you.\"  That very day I went on line and bought the same yarn as the pattern used - a fingering weight yarn (very thin) in a lovely color called Sea Glass - a pale green but in some lights a green-blue - just like the ocean.And, then ... I sat down and read through the pattern.(I can hear the \"oh nos, are you crazy, what were you thinking\" thoughts!Too late for cautions!  The damage was done fast and furious.)Any knitter or crocheter will tell you I did this phase wrong, wrong wrong.  First you read, then you decide, then you order the yarn!  (see the difference?)  *sigh*My version - border in progress - before blocking.The downward slide goes likes this:The discovery of what I had done to myself.First off as I read I noticed this was an Advanced Level knitting pattern.  Hmmm ... I am skilled, and experienced but advanced??  No, not advanced. But not to panic.  Everyone does their first advanced pattern at some point.  Right. This could be my time.The lace pattern was all in lace charts.  Cra-a-p!! I hate knitting charts.  But if I had to write the text version of the charts, I would ... Yes, it would be huge headache but I could work around it.Holy Cow!  This pattern uses 0 sized knitting needles.  In knitting 0 means next to nothing width.  They are the thickness of toothpicks - and some toothpicks are thicker.  They must be joking.  No body does a full size shawl on 0 needles.  I don't even own 0 sized needles.  Off to the internet again to buy what I needed.  I also bought size 1 and 2 so if I could size up the pattern I would.    I decided to add some crystal beads to the border and the points.The camera doesn't catch the sparkle.Further investigation or looking for a way to reduce my panic!Out to Ravelry - a world wide knitting web site - I went to see who else had done this pattern.  When first I checked - NOBODY had done this pattern except the designer.  (No one in all the world.)  Yikes!  Several weeks later one other person posted her finished project!  One!!!  THANK GOD.  Someone else to discuss this with.I sent her a email message.  She responded.  She describes herself as an advanced knitter, who is experienced and comfortable with knitting charts.  She had problems.  She made changes so that she could avoid ripping the yarn out and giving up.\"gulp\"Another shot of the pre-blocked work.The Journey (without swear words)!So by the time I got this less than encouraging news I had already cast on the project and was knitting away with gusto.  I had decided that I had evolved into an Advanced Knitter without realizing it.  I was feeling pretty full of myself!  Things went pretty smoothly for about  ... 5 or 6 rows maybe.  (For the non-knitter - 5 or 6 rows is barely discernible in a project done on 0 needles.  Then I found a mistake.  I tried to fix it.  Couldn't. I ripped it out.  I started again.  My Advanced Knitter Crown tilted on my head.Slowly the shawl progressed with the same pattern of moves: find a mistake, failed the fix, ripped back, knitted forward.  Mistake, fail, rip, knit.  Mistake, fail, rip, knit.  (I think you've got it now.)Any reasonable person would have stopped, and used the yarn for something else.  Not me.  I have never been accused of being reasonable!  Mistake, fail, rip, knit.  I did that so many times I must have made this shawl in total stitches knitted about 3 times.The whole project was 3 steps forward, 2 steps back. Over and over and over again.Finally, through shear determination and hard-headedness, I got down to the bottom of the body of the shawl.  Now to knit the border - a beautiful lacy border with ... wait for it ... THE MOST INCREDIBLY HARD LACE DIRECTIONS IN ALL THE WORLD.   I paused!  I paused for like 3 months.  And I gave up, picked another edging to add to the edge of the shawl and moved on.  I guess there is a reasonable part of my personality after all.Now the shawl border does have 500+ live stitches across the bottom, and they all have to be picked up one at a time by a row of the lace border - which means about 1000 rows are needed to complete the border - but no matter.  They are short rows and it is progressing.And just for the record.  You can insert swear words any where in this section post you like.  In fact, you could insert swear words for every other word and it wouldn't be too many!!!But I spared you that.Lessons Learned!None.  I do this all the time. Jump in and discover the troublesome issues as I get into it.  I have been knitting since 1997 and it is just what I do (with lots of swearing of course.)But when it is done, it should be just lovely.  And my daughter will look great in it.And I will have won this battle with this pattern.  My butt is not whipped.Blocking will pull out the lace pattern and show off the design better.And when it is fully finished and blocked, I will have my daughter model it and pictures will be taken.That should happen the beginning of March because I am going to finish this sucker THIS MONTH!!Signing off,Retired KnitterIntermediate LevelNo Advanced Knitter Crown in sight ... and proud of it!!"},
{"title": "Rooms with new names", "date": "Wednesday, February 5, 2014", "text": "I spent a lot of time thinking about selling our townhouse and moving to another smaller less expensive space.  Now that the old \"homestead\" houses just two old people, 2200 square feet of finished floor space seems way too big - especially when I am cleaning it.  After all, what do we need with 4 bedrooms and 3 1/2 bathrooms - plus a family room.But once we determined that moving from a fully paid for home to somewhere else would be more expensive, I stopped focusing on the goal of moving and started thinking about what the heck I would do with the space. It didn't take long to come up with a plan.The Guest BedroomI have always wanted a guest room.  Our \"guest room\" has always been our pull out couch in the living room and a queen size blow up mattress.  Both are less than perfect for sleeping and very unacceptable for company.  But that was what I had.I still have that but now I also have this:Although it isn't evident in the picture, the room needs painting, but it is OK for now.The maple desk was my desk when I lived at homeI am particularly fond of these lighted flowers.  My daughter-in-law had a setthat I just loved and I had to have my own.They make a wonderful muted night light.And what room would be complete without a bull dog.  At least this onedoesn't have to be walked.  :-)This guest bedroom is located right next to a full bathroom in the lowest level of our townhouse.  This room has changed names so many times it makes my head spin.my son's bedroom, my daughter's bedroom when she moved back home one time (paint choice was hers)my son's bedroom again when he moved back home one time,my mother-in-law's bedroom (briefly) while she was in hospice in our homethe downstairs den - with a treadmill and yarn stuff... and then finally my son and daughter-in-law's room for about 10 months.  It now sleeps three guests in actual beds.Yeah!  Finally!!The DenThis small bedroom room has really never changed names unless you consider that is was more of a \"junk\" room over the years.  Most recently it was also my mother's den for 5 years, and then briefly a shared space for my husband and I - my yarn and his computer.  My husband now has a simple uncluttered space for things that are important to him.  Uncluttered is the operative word since open space and free passage are important to anyone with his decreasing vision.The Yarn RoomThis bedroom has a short but varied history as well.Daughter's bedroomA nothing room for many years - I don't even recall what we did with the space.Mother's bedroomTemporary guest room but still filled with mom's stuffAfter 2+ years in Assisted Living, I have finally reclaimed the space that was mom's.  This was a hard hard thing to do.  I knew she was unable to return, but for some reason I couldn't change the space - it was hers and would be so until she died.  At least that is what my mind was stuck on.Now I realize that it isn't a good use of space.  Her bed has been moved into the guest room.  Her things have all been boxed up and moved into storage in the basement.  The room still has her furniture in it, but now it is filled with my yarn and hobbies.  And it is perfect for this use as it is the brightest room in my house. This room deserves a small tour.You see I have a whole lot of fiber just waiting to be spun.I have a teddy that wears my very first knitted sweater - the sweater I madeduring my learn to knit class in 1997.And the wedding flowers I made for my son and daughter-in-law's wedding ...they had nowhere to live either.And Max, the now newly installed Yarn Cat who lives in my yarn room - healso was homeless (well, not really.  He lives part time in my bedroom.  But thestory flows better if he seemed homeless.)And the bed I bought for the yarn room and the \"homeless\" cat.And the yarn that fills BOTH SIDES AND TOP TO BOTTOM in this closet.  Itwas screaming for a permanent home!! In its last room it was spilling out of the closetand onto the floor.  Now if I can only show restraint and stop buying yarn ...(a wish that I have already broken with a purchase this month and a second purchase this month is on my radar.)The only thing that might work to \"cure\" me would be some kind of an \"intervention.\"But I will go down fighting with my pointy sticks if I have to!!!You have been warned!!!So now all these wonderful items now live in my yarn room.I love my yarn room.LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this crafty cluttered space that is just mine.Hope you enjoyed the tour."},

Sometimes \"dismal\" is the only thing that gets me off the couch.Fitbit has an outstanding support web site.  It is free and since the Fitbit pedometer automatically syncs to the web site when you are near your computer or phone or iPad, there is no extra effort to log your progress.  No extra effort translates to me as no excuses!  They also have a food tracking segment and it automatically adjusts your allowed calorie intake based on your activity level without losing sight of your weight loss goals - which is an awesome feature!  My focus is activity.  Weight loss is nice but when that is my focus I fail.  But that is just me.No lie.  Walking last month was a struggle. First of all it was darn cold - like around 0 to 10 degrees many days.  With the added wind and icy conditions, it was dangerous.  Then I managed to injure a muscle in my groin and leg area.  I lifted a 37 lb French Bull Dog (one of my dear grand dogs) twice in one day, carrying him across overly salty stretches of public streets and up my salty steps to save his little feet (what else would a good grandmother do.)  Little did I know that it was too much for one of my muscles.  That darn 2 week old injury still haunts me, but I am pushing through it gently.Cold weather conditions aside, for some reason, my body wasn't bouncing positively into walking like it has always done in the past.  My legs felt heavy, I was winded, energy levels were low.  When I did go for a walk it wasn't the positive energizing experience I always had in the past.  Am I just too out of shape?  Has my age made \"bouncing into exercise\" less do-able?  Is January just a hibernation month?  I decided that whatever the reason, my body would eventually catch up with the demands of my brain.  I did slow the walk down in deference to my injury.  I focused on just taking the steps and movement. Even with all those limitations, I was totally surprised to find my daily average for January to be as good as 7,000+ steps a day.  Wow, I would have guessed around 5,000.  I guess I had some very good days among the lousy ones. I can certainly do better on my strength training and stretching routine as well.  Five times in one month is pretty poor.  But the routine has shown that I haven't yet lost any gains in my stretching extensions. So that is my Healthy Me update for January."},
{"title": "Frosty February", "date": "Sunday, February 2, 2014", "text": "So here we are all in February.  Another wintery - and probably snowy - month. Goals are the focus for me this month.I am going to announce them here - so I have some way of checking back and comparing my results at the end of the month.Here we go:Finish one of my jumbo knitting projects. I have three on the needles, but right now it looks like the finish-it project will be my daughter's shawl.  (a hard one) Beat my January step average in February. (an easy one)Complete my exercise routine 4 times a week average. (should be do-able)Clean out my bedroom and upstairs hall closets. (Only God knows what is in them.)Blog at least one more time before the end of the month. (should be easy but ... famous last words)That should do it for goals.  February is a pretty significant month for two other reasons.  The Winter Olympics start on February 8.  Yeah!!  I am a huge fan of the Olympics - especially the Winter Olympics.  And I am really excited about the venue - Russia.   I'll be spending a lot of knitting time watching the athletes of the world compete.  I hope the US does well, but really, it is all about excellence - human excellence - and I am totally human, so I am ready to cheer them all.   Just hoping we can have a safe event.This month mom turns 88 years old on February 6.  It always stuns me when I think over the last 10 years.  I started worrying about how she was doing when she was 78.  She took 2 years to make any decisions about living arrangements.  At 80 she moved in with me.  When she was 2 months shy of 86 she moved into Assisted Living.  Now at 88 years old we have been on this rocky journey together for 10 years.  Ten whole years.  That is a big chunk of both our lives.  Mom has changed greatly during these years and surprisingly so have I.  Neither one of us has changed for the best I fear.  But I celebrate her upcoming birthday.  I wish it was a more active and healthy time for her, but long life is still a gift - no matter how it looks.That is my February. We are in the grips of Winter.  Even though I love love love winter, I am beginning to appreciate the values of spring a little better!  :-)  (Wow, I never thought I would say those words!)So what does your February look like?"},
{"title": "January fleeting", "date": "Saturday, February 1, 2014", "text": "My gosh!  January is over.  I wrote this post 2 days ago hoping to get pictures attached.  Then January just slipped way - all because I waited for pictures. I am posting without pictures!I haven't been idle.  Here is a fast update.My new guest room and yarn room and husband den!With the departure of my son and daughter-in-law in October, once again I was left with a town house that is too large for our personal needs.  And then I got to thinking. \"Self ... you aren't moving somewhere else because living here is cheaper than anywhere else.\"\"Self ... you always wanted a guest room where the beds were ever-ready for guests.  Why not do that now?\"\"Self ... you are outgrowing your current yarn / craft space (because you can't seem to stop buying collecting yarn and fiber tools.  But you didn't hear me say that out loud.)  Maybe it is time to fix that.\"\"Self ... your husband needs to have his own space - his own den - because his wife is becoming less of a sharer as she get older.\"  (someday insert a grumpy picture here of an aging grumpy woman - maybe even my picture. LOL)\"Self ... you have the space now to spread out and get what you want.  What are you waiting for?\" \"Self ... you aren't getting any younger and before you know it these stupid stairs will become a barrier for you and you will be forced to move.  Stop wasting time.\" \"SO Self ... stop talking and get busy.\"And that is exactly what I did.  Here are the pictures to prove it.(Ha!  My space saver for pictures!!  No pics!  Use your imagination here.)Thanks to my son, daughter and daughter-in-law for helping to move all the big pieces of furniture around and make this move possible.  Now I can stop talking to myself!*****Ocean CityAnd then there was the trip to the ocean that seems to be a regular event with the cousins - it is where we sit in the condo, look at the ocean, knit, weave, spin, laugh, eat, drink wine, and generally enjoy a weekend free of life's responsibilities all while never getting out of our pajamas.  I didn't take pictures this time, but pictures from the last visit would look exactly like this visit.  So here is the link to that post.*****ExerciseStaying active, walking and exercises, are going slowly.  A leg injury and outside temps near 0 have slowed me up considerably.  I am still wearing my FitBit pedometer and I will calculate my January step average this weekend.  My February goal will be to beat my January average.  Sadly the February goal won't be too hard to achieve because I suspect my January average will be embarrassing low.  But it isn't about today or tomorrow or next week.  It is about the long view.  The long view includes spring and I am getting fit for spring.  :-)  At least that is what I tell myself.  My back and knee exercise routine is created and sometimes done.  But again, not as regularly as I need to.  I have posted a calendar in my yarn room where I can easily see just how inactive I am.  The statistics should be posted in the local newspaper and tattooed on my forehead for maximum embarrassment, but I will settle on this simple calendar.  I will say that my arthritis in my knee is much improved. ******KnittingI am back to knitting every single day.  I had fallen into a slump.  Not a good place to be when you have a room full of beautiful yarns.  But I had hit a skill-level barrier with one project and the stall trickled into all my knitting.   Until I figured out how to work around the problem, I had lost my knitting mojo.  Back on track now.  I have three jumbo sized projects on the needles and I need to keep moving.  Pictures??  Ha!  Not today.  Whip out the imagination one more time.******Lap TopI got a new Mac Lap Top computer this month.  After 5+ years of excellent service and several falls, my old Apple started doing wonky things.  That darn thing continued to work, however.  In fact I thought I was heading for a new computer in November of 2012 when it fell from my kitchen counter onto my hard tile floor, and here we are in January 2014. It still hasn't totally failed but it was time.   I will never never never own anything but a Mac!  It is a work horse and it is worth every single penny of addition money it costs to own one.******MomShe has had mostly decent days.  Winter is hard on the elderly.  Yesterday, however, was a bad day.  Her ability to provide self care is slipping noticeably on some days.  When I arrived she was sitting in her wheel chair, her hearing aide batteries were dead so she wasn't responding.  When I reached her I noticed that a bathroom accident was evident all over her and she didn't seem to be aware.  It had not yet  been discovered by the staff so she was in a sad state - unable to help herself and has long since lost the ability to consistently ask for help when she needs it.  It was a very hard morning.  When I left things were back to normal.  But I left with a heavy heart.*****So that has been my January.  Although I haven't blogged a lot, I've been busy and I have been visiting with many of you.  You keep me inspired to put my fingers to the keyboard here. I have some plans for February - but that is for another post!And maybe even a picture or two!!"},

A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.The average age of the world's greatest civilizations from the beginning of history has been about 200 years. During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence:From bondage to spiritual faith;From spiritual faith to great courage;From courage to liberty;From liberty to abundance;From abundance to complacency;From complacency to apathy;From apathy to dependence;From dependence back into bondage.\"Alexander Fraser Tytler, Scottish Born British Lawyer and Writer 1747-1813Ok - if that last quote/thought/reference (whatever) doesn't scare you a little bit, then you haven't been paying attention to what is happening in our own \"great civilization.\" Hmmm....."},
{"title": "Through My Caregiver Eyes: The \"Stuff\" of life", "date": "Tuesday, December 3, 2013", "text": "It has been just over 2 years ...Two years since my mom left my house for good - to move to Rehab and then to Assisted Living. While mom lived here, she had a small suite of rooms: a private bathroom, a bedroom and a den.  She squeezed the stuff of her life into those rooms.  She was happy to do so because she had the things that mattered to her - and the security of living with family.  She had her \"stuff\" ... and everyone needs their stuff.During her 5 years with me her stuff remained constant - never growing, never shrinking. She wasn't a spender and really needed little.   But other elements of her life shrunk and declined.  Some loss of independence, reduced ability to manage her small responsibilities, loss of driving, and finally declining health.  Eventually she even lost her ability to live with family.And what of her stuff ...Well I kept all her stuff just as she left it in her rooms for awhile.Eight months after she moved, I decided to sort through her belongings and repackage them so that they fit snuggly into her bedroom.  It was time to reclaim the den for our use.  I downsized for her: for example she wouldn't need a Forman Grill, or craft supplies that her arthritic hands no longer could manage, or that mountain of papers she tucked away like a squirrel hiding nuts.  The downsizing was hard because it was an acceptance ...  she would not be returning. Still I kept her bedroom unchanged.  I couldn't seem to let that go.After a year I removed the Chair Lift off the stairs.  It was a trip hazard for my husband who has limited vision ... and with mom not here, it served no purpose.  That was another small heart ache for me.Now on the 2nd Anniversary of her life in Assisted Living - I decided to reclaim her bedroom.  Fortunately we have space in the lower level of our house to store her things.  But they no long reside in her room.  Her room is no longer \"her room.\"  I have spent several nights boxing up her stuff and carrying it downstairs.  While that act has made me sad, it is not the worst.  Her total belongings have reduced to the size of one closet - exactly one closet of \"stuff\" left from a long life.  Her bedroom furniture will remain.  I downsized and packed away small stuff but not big stuff.I know this sadness is mine alone.  Others may not understand my feelings.  Even mom wouldn't understand because she neither wants nor remembers any of these things.  In fact, the few things I brought to her Assisted Living room she did not want displayed.  It was like she had no plans to put down roots in that place.  Her roots were in my home and now they are in boxes.The \"stuff\" of life can bring joy or sadness - even if the stuff isn't yours. So I am fighting to focus on those things that aren't \"stuff.\"  Her Thanksgiving was filled with family  - not things in boxes.  I fight those sad feelings since I can't control this decline and loss.  It is just a normal part of life.  I focus on \"being there\" for her.Here she is with her family on Thanksgiving when we all gathered together to watch the parades and to share a Turkey Meal.  It was not home but she really enjoyed the visit.Dear mom,My home will always be your home despite the fact your legs will never carry you into it again.  You will always belong within the loving arms of your family.  Your stuff is just stuff.  Your real achievements are the great family you built and supported over the years.  You are much loved.  There is nothing else that matters.Love,Retired KnitterDaughter and Caregiver"},
{"title": "The run up ...", "date": "Monday, November 18, 2013", "text": "So for a change ... I am going to be a big girl ... a responsible and courteous blogger ... and announce that I will be on a blog break (short one) until after Thanksgiving.We are in \"the run up\" to the busiest time of the year. I don't multi-task well anymore.  Juggling multiple priorities just isn't as seamless as it used to be.  Blocking time and being focused is the only answer.For example, here is a sampling ...This year we are having two ... yes, two ... Thanksgiving dinners - spaced about 4 hours apart.  And I am not cooking either one!! It should be, however, a crazy day.  First we are heading out to see Mom in Assisted Living to have a meal with her.  It will be great fun as almost all her family will be coming.  Most residents are mobile enough to go home for a brief visit on the holidays, so mom's building will get very quiet and somewhat empty.  Not the best place to be when it is Turkey Day.  We are hoping to fill mom's morning and early afternoon with family and fun - so that her Thanksgiving also has some zest to it.  The plan is to get there early enough to watch the parades and then share a meal - Thanksgiving dinner #1.  It isn't ideal - but it is the best we can manage when she is so immobile.  Then we are heading into Baltimore City to have Thanksgiving dinner #2 with friends.  We are really looking forward to this.  They live in an old Victorian Townhome - built before 1900 - and it is always great fun to visit them. Then there is my upcoming physical therapy that starts this week.  Intense but short in duration, thankfully.   And my weekly exercise classes, and my daily walks and my soon-to-start exercise videos on off class days.  I hope I don't kill myself in the name of good health.  Wouldn't that be ironic!!  My walking routine is going great guns!  I am averaging 11,000 steps per day and climbing.  I am so grateful that my body responds so well to exercise and the transition from inactive to active is always pretty fast.  Guess it is nature's way of saying ... no excuses, just do it!!I haven't started my Christmas shopping - and since I am an online shopper, that really needs to start happening this week.I need to decorate early for Christmas - since our usual \"after-Christmas Christmas Party\" will be a \"before-Christmas Christmas Party\" this year.  My decorating is markedly reduced but it will still take a few hours.And although I significantly slimmed down my Christmas \"to-dos\" last year - and will continue to do so this year - there are things that need to be done - starting now.  I enjoy the holiday way more if I get my Christmas tasks done by mid-December.  Then I can focus on a relaxed and happy holiday.This list doesn't end there, but it is a start.And although I said \"happy holiday\" in my previous breath, the truth is I find this time of year stress filled.  I hate the deadline feel of the month, the sad memories of a few holidays recently that were not so merry, the loss of the old way of celebrating because mom is so limited and unable to fully participate.  Times change and so do traditions.  Building new traditions and happy memories takes time.   But, for now, during this time of year, \"happy\" is still a relative term for me.  Getting to January is my goal.So welcome to the flavor of my life right now. Back in mid-December."},
{"title": "Thankful", "date": "Friday, November 15, 2013", "text": "In Blog World it seems like November is the month for giving thanks publicly for all of our blessings ... and everyone's life is filled with blessings if they just look!This process of giving thanks is a way to honor our American holiday of Thanksgiving.I visit a number of wonderful blogs - some devote one post to gratitude, some do it all month long, and some do it periodically throughout the year.  What a wonderful way to create a \"gratitude journal.\"  I have heard from many sources that a gratitude journal is a very effective method of making your own life joy filled.I clearly have not done it at all.So here goes. My list for November 2013 - and I will go for 20!The big things I am grateful for:This blog.  I would never have discovered my love of writing without it or discover such wonderful blog friends.  Without this blog I'd have had no place to vent pour out my thoughts. They would pile up in my head and leak out my ears and generally make my life constipated. (hmm ... better stop that line of imagery now.)  For my wonderful body.  It responds soooo well to exercise ... like when my knee gave out.  It is healthier than many of my peer group - without much help from me I might add.  It continues to run problem free (knock on wood) despite the fact I don't always fuel it with healthy things.For my mind.  So far ... so good - at least that is what my mind is telling me about itself today. For my family.  Really ... my \"by-chance blood relatives\" are great.  Sure, there have been a few bumps in the road, but a loving family makes the struggles of life easier.My retirement.  I have been known to say that \"someday I will really get to retire.\"  But truthfully, without retirement almost 7 years ago I wouldn't have had the time or energy to be there for my mom.  She was and is my first retirement project.For my mom.  I am so lucky to have her still with me.  At 87 (next February she will be 88), I know my time with her is limited. Her struggles with aging have put perspective on my own older years.  I also discovered a level of compassion I wouldn't have seen in myself without her.For my town home.  This town home has housed so much of my life over 28 years.  Kids, mothers, deaths, weddings, friends, parties, hobbies, sadness and joy.  I discovered just this year how important all that was.  Yes, we were thinking of moving, but when that decision was tabled ... relief!  I guess I wasn't ready to give up these 4 walls and the memories they hold just yet.My room full of yarn and stuff.  Nu'ff said!  :-)My grand dogs and my cats.  Meathead, Grimace and Milo.  Wally and Max.  Just last November my dear Meathead was so sick (at 10 years of age - old for an English Bull Dog) that euthanasia was a thought looming in all our minds.  One year later (now 11 years of age and very old), he is doing just fine.  Dogs are such great companions because they make you feel pretty special.  Cats are such great companions because they tell it like it is - \"Think your pretty special?  Think again.\"My husband.  Who drives me crazy some days, who is losing his vision all days, but who has stood by my side for 44 years worth of days - through some pretty dark times.  Now for the smaller stuff:My computer, iPhone, iPad, and Kindle - wow, am I on board with the electronic life or what!My Subaru - such a reliable car. My water bottle - that reminds me all the time to \"Drink more water!\"Coffee - my first friend of the dayWine - my last friend of the day - the friend that rewards me while I cook dinner and gets me through this process 365 days a year.  Thank God one glass is supposed to be heart healthy.  Thank you God!Veggies - my new best friend. Thank you Mother Nature!My FitBit Flex pedometer - that keeps me off my butt a little bit more.  A Mother's Day gift from my daughter.  Thank you Kris.My causal wardrobe - if I had to wear heels and dress clothes everyday I would puke!My lists - that keep me from day-dreaming my time away.My quiet time - time to look \"inside\" yourself and see how things are going.You know, when you do this process - look for the things you are grateful to have - the list can be endless.  And the stuff that seems to be lacking - fades away for a bit.A good thing to do!  And I do feel more joy-filled!"},
{"title": "Healthy at 100 by John Robbins", "date": "Tuesday, November 12, 2013", "text": "First let me say ... have no intention of living to 100 years of age.  If it happens, ok.  But it is not a goal!Far from it!Photo curtesy of Amazon.comBut what is a goal is being active and engaged in all the years of my life that are left to me.  And over the last 5 years I have sadly discovered that I cannot just slip freely through life at the same level of function as I did when I was 20 or 30 or even 40.  Really, staying normal now appears to take way more work on my part ... if I want \"active and engaged.\"And after taking care of my mom ... and still involved in elder care first hand ... I most definitely was to be active and engaged!!In this regard I can highly recommend John Robbins' book - Healthy at 100: The Scientifically Proven Secrets of the World's Healthiest and Longest-Lived Peoples.To be totally honest, I didn't expect all that much from a book with the title - Healthy at 100.  It sounds too much like so many of those self-help books that really helps no one but the author who benefits from the proceeds of the sale.  Why I bought it I will never know!  But I am so grateful that I did.To begin with the author is the son of one of the founders of the Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream empire.  No, he doesn't support the eating of ice cream, and he did include a rather unbiased story about how the author's life style choices went over with his father ... not well!  But John Robbins' background is certainly interesting in light of the fact he comes from such a well known ice cream company.To summarize the book as briefly as possible - the book begins with a look at several of the world's most long lived peoples.  That section is interesting all by itself.  Then he isolates the characteristics that enabled these peoples to live long and joyous lives, and applies these characteristics to our culture and the choices we make.  As the back cover quotes, \"With an emphasis on simple, wholesome, yet satisfying fare, a manageable daily exercise routine and the cultivation of strong, loving personal relationships, Robbins gives us the tools for making our later years a period of wisdom, vitality, and happiness.\"Yep!  That says it all.  After listening to the audio version, I promptly visited two books stores seeking a hard copy because over and over again there were sections I wanted to underline, refer to again and practice.  I needed this book in my hands and not just in my ears.  I can assure you that has never happened before in all my audio book listening.  Never.  One store was sold out and the other copy had one copy (Now they are sold out too.)  :-)Yes, I do plan to re-read this book and mark it up so that I have reminders when I forget or lose my way in trying to stay active and engaged. That also doesn't ever happen.  I never re-read books.Now I will say - there is no magic pill offered in the text.  It all comes down to eat good, keep moving, stay connected.  Really, it is not a new premise.  But John Robbins does such an excellent job of convincing you that it is worth the time to make the effort ... including the studies and human history to support the premise ...  that you can make a difference to your own older years and that it is never too late.I will close with a statement from the book that is so true.\"Many people in modern societies today succumb to the belief that aging means becoming the helpless victim of a slow, tortuous, and inevitable deterioration.  They live in fear, believing that with each passing year they will only feel worse and suffer more.  They do not exercise.  They eat unhealthful foods.  They shut down emotionally.  Eventually, their fear becomes self-fulfilling, and they create the very tragedy they believed would occur.\"This book is worth your time!"},
{"title": "Steak or Beans", "date": "Saturday, November 9, 2013", "text": "Seriously if 5 years ago someone said ... you will consider going vegetarian ... I would have laughed them out of the room (and then locked the door.)Lately, my body just doesn't seem interested in beef or pork or poultry or lamb. Even fish seems to be on my endangered list of things going in my mouth.My body is just changing (along with those recently discovered arthritic knees) and it doesn't desire meat.  Even bacon ... that heavenly, tasty, mouth-savoring bacon ... maybe 2 pieces are fine, but not the fist full I used to be able to ingest before it registered in my mind I had swallowed that much. In fact, that BLT sandwich (Bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich) I so loved ALL my life - that fed my pregnant body while I grew my son .... that sandwich I had for breakfast, lunch and dinner back then (and for snack if no one was looking) - that sandwich now sounds really better if I toast a hearty piece of bread, spread on full fat mayo, and layer on lettuce and tomato, skipping the bacon.Something is changing ... I think it is a positive change.  Really ... at 66 how many positive changes can you really expect with regards to your body?  From where I sit ... watching my mom age and decline ... the answer to that question is NONE!!So I will take it!  If I don't need meat - if that love affair has come to an end - so be it!  Onward - and fall in love with something else.Like vegetables!Does this mean I will become a zealot regarding the \"wonders of a vegetarian life style.\"  Oh my no.  I still love and eat things like cheese and eggs.  I will continue to use chicken and beef broth in cooking.  I am not looking to go \"low fat\" or \"low carb\" or low anything else.  And since I am married to a \"meat and potatoes\" man, I will still cook meat - so at times - I will probably still eat a little of it. This change is not the result of political concerns or environmental issues or animal rights.  I abhor the way our meat producing industry treats the animals, but I also accept the reality of that industry.  There are one heck of a lot of homo sapiens on the planet - and I believe we are both meat and vegetable eating beings naturally.But I will make a sincere effort to understand the \"no meat\" point of view with regards to healthy options.  I have already started getting educated.  Here are a few titles I currently have in my arsenal to support my new food choices.The China Study by T.

CampbellComprehensive Study of Nutrition and the implications for diet, weight loss and long-term health.Bean by Bean: A Cookbookby Crescent DragonwagonAn introduction to beans and other legumes with 175 recipesHealthy at 100:The Scientifically Proven Secrets of the World's Healthiest and Longest-Lived Peoplesby John RobbinsThis is not a cook book or a diet book.  This author takes you around the world to meet pockets of people who routinely live healthy active lives - typically over the age of 100 - many to ages of 120 and 130.  He examines their life styles and the foods they eat.  It is extremely well-researched.   He finds common themes that can influence and improve our own lives.  I am currently listening to the audio version and it is fascinating.  VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00by Mark BittmanMark Bittman is a prolific food writer.  Six years ago he was overweight and pre-diabetic and was told to go on a vegan diet or go on medication.  His solution was to become a \"flexitarian.\"   He adopted a diet heavy in vegetables, fruits and grains following a healthy vegan diet (no meat, dairy, or processed food) all day. After 6:00 pm he'd eat what he wanted, though mostly in moderation.  Beyond that, his plan involved no gimmicks, scales, calorie counting or point system.  There were no forbidden foods. Although the Vegan focus is not on my radar, I look forward to reading this book published in May 2013 - as his point of view seems to be similar to my own goals.How to Cook Everything Vegetarian by Mark BittmanThis is a 3 inch thick book - and, yes, it seems to cover everything.I have a few more books on my Amazon Wish List as well.  I really love the Mark Bittman books and will be getting more.  They aren't the glossy picture filled type of cook book, but they are filled with so much information that each volume almost feels like the encyclopedia of that topic. If you are in-the-know with regards to other good authors or sources - books, pod casts, blogs,  web sites on the vegetable based diet - please let me know."},
{"title": "Walking, the obstacles and truth!", "date": "Wednesday, November 6, 2013", "text": "I started back to walking again in October.  It was a stumble of a start.So here goes the saga of the stumble.First I had to find time to squeeze it in the hours of my life.  As a retired person that should be a piece of cake. It wasn't.  I persisted.  And the walking sessions became more frequent. Really.  If it is something that is worthwhile doing - you find the time.  That is the simple truth.  And that is what I kept telling myself.  So I found the time.Then I discovered that my FitBit battery was dead - and I couldn't find the cable recharger anywhere.  Yes, yes, yes, I know!  The walk still counts even if I don't know how many steps I am taking.  But it sure puts a crimp in my enthusiasm when I can't confirm just how active I was or wasn't at the end of the day.  So I sat down and order two cables!  Problem solved  .... until I lose those! (Maybe I will order a few more.)Then yesterday I visited the doctor. You see, I have noisy knees!  They click and crack and generally talk to me!  I generally don't listen!  They talk.  I ignore.  It was a \"marriage\" that worked for years.  Then the beginning of September the noise got louder - added to the clicks and cracks was the occasional pain.  One morning I couldn't walk down my stairs very well.  The left knee was talking in a very loud voice.  I assumed injury.  No matter.  Most things get better if you just give them enough time (ignore them).  It did get better.  Then it didn't.  More time.  Got better again.  Then it came back.  The noise level was louder and more frequent.  But I had perfected ignoring to a masterful skill level. I am the Black Belt of Ignoring. Ninja Ignoring!And there was Advil ... my best friend ... !  It cured things some!  I was happy.  Until 6 hours later when I wasn't happy!Crap!And so I made a doctor's appointment 2 weeks ago - but the knee got better before the visit - so I canceled it.   Then it came back again.So ... yesterday I visited the doctor.  I actually stepped into the office ... thinking the whole time ... \"You only gave this knee two months to get well.  Maybe you should cancel this appointment.\"  This is a Ninja technique.I talked.  He listened. He looked first at my good knee - the right one.  Said ... \"Sounds like a little arthritis in that knee.\" \"Hey, doc ... it is the left knee that hurts ... leave my good right knee alone!  It only 'talks' some.  It is not a problem.\" He looked at my left knee.  \"That knee is swollen.\"SWOLLEN!REALLY!  I looked down and sure enough.  My left knee was bigger than my right knee.  Hmmm... Was I born that way and just never noticed?  Would he believe me if I said that? Would he commit me if I said that???I looked again.  Yup!  Swollen!  I never actually looked at the knee.  So much for being \"in tune\" with my body.He tried to bend it - it bent - mostly - just not as much as the other one!  Has it always been that way? Don't go there, I said to my mind as I searched for other lies.And it hurt when he bent it.   Well ... in truth ... it was hurting before he bent it!!Truth ... that is what is missing in my relationship with my body it appears!\"Definitely bilateral arthritis of the knees,\"  he proclaimed.Double Crap!  I was hoping for an injury! You know, maybe take a few of those miracle pills, strap on a knee bace, heat, cold, maybe a little surgery ... whatever.  Crap, crap, crap.So ... an xray was ordered, an orthopedic surgeon appointment was recommended, start taking glucosamine chondroitin, maybe injections into the knee, physical therapy and painful conversations with my knees seem to be in my future.  And he thought time spent in a gym keeping my muscles strong would be a good idea. Just Great!  I really don't like gyms.Am I surprised by any of this?  Not really.  I am a cookie cutter copy of my mom who has struggled with arthritis in her knees for many more years than I will struggle.But I have hung up my Ninja Ignoring Black Belt.  Can't ignore the knee any more.  I will do everything they say and will remain active because that is what works with arthritis - once you stop moving you freeze up.  I have seen that first hand in my mom.Ok knees, I am listening now.A walking obstacle?I think not!"},
{"title": "Yikes!! An Amazing Halloween House", "date": "Friday, October 25, 2013", "text": "The story begins in early October 2012.   The most interesting full sized Halloween displays began to appear in a neighbor's long driveway.  Daily I saw ghosts, skeletons, tomb stones, rustic wood fences with stone pillars and all sorts of haunting displays magically popped up - I say \"magically\" because I never saw the home owner.Then, once the spooky display was complete, the unthinkable happened.  Hurricane Sandy came to  town just days before Halloween.  Over night  all the displays disappeared.  I didn't see it go up and I didn't see it go down. Now it is October 2013.  Last week, like mushrooms popping suddenly out of the ground, I noticed the haunting displays growing.  Again, no homeowner was in evidence. Several days ago I noticed a startling expansion.  There was scaffolding on the front of the house at the end of the driveway.  Walls were being built about 6 feet out from the house's exterior - two story walls - with spooky looking windows and a painted stone front to match the drive way's stone pillars - and still, I saw no homeowner! Yesterday I walked by again - and there he was - a flesh and blood person (THANKFULLY!).  I just HAD to walk down his drive way and talk with him.  A very charming (and normal looking) man.  :-) His favorite holiday is ... of course, Halloween.  He's been building these Halloween displays for years starting when his kids were little.  Each year he saves up and expands his creation.  This yearhe decided to \"haunt-i-fy\" his house.What an understanding wife he must have!  Can you imagine ... your husband showing up with scaffolding and a plan to make the outside of the house look run down and haunted?So here are just a few pictures.  My camera is not really good enough to capture all this Halloween fun.  But you get the idea.Enjoy!The entrance to the drive way. Normally the drive way is just grass and a few bushes.The next area beyond the entrance.A charming welcoming!A very scary image in the dark drive way. I was very brave!  :-)Guess this soul was a bad bad person in life!The blue lighting was very effective.And then there is this guy - coming out of the ground.The House!The blue light area is the opening to the garage. The lights move and change colors.The orange doorway to the left is the door to the house.The windows above the garage opening!Garage close up.Now the garage lights are pick - and, yes, there are displays within.No hurricanes are predicted this year so this Halloween should be a real hoot for the kids of our neighborhood.Happy Halloween Everyone!"},
{"title": "An empty nest ... finally.", "date": "Tuesday, October 22, 2013", "text": "I know this blog is supposed to be focused on my \"next 20 years.\"  But my thoughts have been focused on the last 20 years a lot as late.  And those years have been filled with changes that staggers my mind as I review it.Now I am facing the newest change - an empty nest - the literal description of one's life when all the kids have left home for good.  I have eagerly looked forward to this time and now that it is here I feel a bit numb to the prospect.For me ... my empty nest describes more than just the kids growing up and moving out.  In the last 20 years the scope of life that kept my nest full was broad.  Most of it has pealed away.The late 90's were filled with my husband's grandmother, and then his mother, during the last years of their lives.  My husband and I were laid off from jobs during this time ... both at the same time and both from long time employers.  My two adult kids both left and returned home more than once during those years.  They are now flying through life with their \"adult wings.\"  My daughter recently purchased her own property ... a kind of adult passage.  My son married officially stepping out of our \"nest\" to build his own.  I lost a level of intimacy and trust with a close person or two - a sad reality, and I may never return to that blissful naive state again.  My husband was diagnosed with a degenerative eye condition that cannot be cured and will lead to blindness - changing both our lives in ways we never could have anticipated.  My mom lived with me for 5 years and the heart break of moving her out of my home and into Assisted Living pretty much ate up the last of my personal care giving reserves.  And this month my son and daughter-in-law who had temporarily lived with me for 10 months, moved into their new home - taking my grand-dogs with them.  There are still a few \"remnants\" left in my role as \"nest maintainer\" ... I am still overseer of mom's care as she slowly drifts out of this life in assisted living.  But the \"nest\" I tended so carefully is pretty vacant now.There is one glaring reality.  I did not really prepare for this state of empty nest. The last few days I found myself cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.  Cleaning has always been a coping mechanism when I am upset, or unsure or just numb.  I am not upset - as all of these changes are the way of life.  But I feel numb ...  open and empty.  I worry about when the house is clean.  Then what!So I need to focus more on me.  I have been pretty good at looking the other way - but my being says now it is time to focus on you.  I have talked about that in the past - but the hours of the day were always filled with the needs and desires of all those things that filled my nest.Yesterday I went for a walk.  It was one of those \"first day\" of a walking routine that I hoped to build.  I have a long, long history of \"first days.\".  But lately I have noticed my legs have various aches, my knees are giving me problems and my energy levels are pretty low. I have seen this before.  I have seen it in mom!  Fear sent me out the door on that walk - and now that my nest is pretty empty, fear is as good a motivator as anything.I have also signed up for a strength training class starting in November.  I believe a Yoga class will also become part of my routine.  And these knees may need a professional evaluation because I don't want them to become an \"excuse\" for not moving.  I have seen that as well - in mom! Fear!  Whatever works!Finally, blogging as been a struggle lately.  That is actually a good sign.  My blog kept me sane during some pretty tough and unhappy years, but now it feels like just another thing on my \"To Do\" list.  The need is just not there to write and vent and chatter on.  I considered stopping the blog - thought about it many times over the last 2 months - but I could never \"do the deed\" and say goodbye.  Guess I was not ready to end this ... after so many other endings.So here I am blathering on to you! Guess blogging will be part of my empty nest after all.Thanks for taking the time to read this.  I'll be back again - just not sure when.  My blog will join so many other blogs that I follow where posts crop up now and again, but never goes away!Cheers!"},
{"title": "365 Slow Cooker Suppers by Stephanie O'Dea", "date": "Thursday, September 19, 2013", "text": "Let me say right off ...I am totally STOKED about presenting this cook book to my readers. 365 Slow Cooker Suppers by Stephanie O'DeaI am such a fan of her previous two cookbooks and this time, I was lucky enough (and totally honored) to receive a review copy of her newest cookbook prior the release date of September 24. Long time readers of my blog know that I reviewed a previous book of hers on my blog back in 2010 -  and she most graciously commented on that blog post.  You can imagine just how shocked I was to hear directly from an author - especially an author who I admired.  What a kind thing to do!!  I never forgot that.Anyway, when she offered bloggers an opportunity to receive a review copy of her newest book, 365 Slow Cooker Suppers, I jumped at the opportunity! Thank you so much Stephanie.First let's get the less interesting stats out of the way on 365 Slow Cooker Suppers:Stephanie O'Dea is a blogger. Crockpot365.blogspot.com.  I have a weakness for bloggers.Publisher: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt  -  www.hmhbooks.com3rd Crock Pot Cook Book by Stephanie O'Dea (Make It Fast, Cook It Slow and More Make It Fast, Cook It Slow).  I have both books and they are great.336 pages$24.99 retailBook organization:  Soups and Stews, Beans, Poultry, Beef and Lamb, Pork, Sandwiches, Meatless and Fish and Seafood.What I love:Beautiful photography! Her first two books had no photos.  I didn't think that it was a minus, because when I cook, my results seldom looks like the picture.  Food photography is an art.  It takes a special kind of person to make beef stew smile.  There were many smiling foods in this book.  This book focuses on suppers only.  Perfect!!  Most cook books spread themselves a bit thin by having samples of all the possible food options (breakfast, side dishes, desserts, and main dishes).  When it comes to the Crock Pot, I am a main dish kind of girl.  Throw it all in the crock pot, turn it on and 8 hours later dinner is done.  I have never made breakfast or dessert in a crock pot.  Those sections of other crock pot cookbooks are wasted on me.Don't you hate recipes that have 25+ ingredients and just as many steps of preparation. Or how about the 3 ingredient recipes ... I get so turned off by the swings of extremes in recipe creation.    Stephanie has an average of 10-15 ingredients in a recipe (a few that have more.)  In my mind this means this is not an over simplified slow cooker cook book - that uses 3 or 4 ingredients (one being canned soup) and then calls the results \"great.\"  Nor is it a recipe that take 30 minutes to collect all the ingredients before you can do anything.  I have a few books in both categories and they are heading into my recycling because I never make anything in them.   Steph's balance of ingredients and preparation steps are perfect and realistic for the every day cook. In her first 2 books she used \"The Verdict\" to report family reactions and other observations on each recipe.  She has continued this practice in book 3.  I totally love these snippets.  I feel like the author is talking directly to me ... giving me the inside scoop on this particular dish.  Obviously she wouldn't have included recipes that were duds, so you don't have that kind of feedback in \"The Verdict.\"  But if you are interested in how well a specific recipe was received by kids and other members of the family, or how light or filling a meal was, or will it freeze well, or kudos to others (with websites referenced), \"The Verdict\" provides this feedback.  To be totally honest, sometimes I read The Verdict before I check out the ingredients.Things that could be better?  Well, I prefer to characterize my slim list of improvements as \"wishes for the next book.\"  Really, there is little that could make the recipes better.  But the publisher might consider these options:Spiral binding - cook books that lie flat while you are using them are user friendly. I am considering have all three of her books punched for spiral binding at a local office supply store.  Nutritional information for each recipe - health and weight conscious folks would really appreciate this added information.  Next week I will be preparing two recipes from this book and I will report back on the outcome with pictures and comments. And just for the record, it took me all of about 2 minutes to find those two recipes.  In quickly checking out the options for meals, I think I could have closed my eyes and just picked two at random ... they all sounded great!"},
{"title": "Through My Caregiver Eyes - Memories", "date": "Friday, August 30, 2013", "text": "This is the latest entry in a continuing series called Through My Caregiver Eyes.  The full story can be found under the label \"Through My Caregiver Eyes.\" (Label Section to the right of my blog posts.)  My mom is 87 years old and is in Assisted Living. The rocky path from independence to living with me and finally to Assisted Living is documented in this series.  While our journey together is peppered with joy-filled moments, it is mostly losses for her and sadness for me. For those of you who are caregivers of elderly loved ones, you may see yourself in my story.Memories are intangible things that can make life worth living, and at other times, sad to recall. Memories can fade and be lost, and in the elderly, sometimes the loss is permanent.  I believe it is the loss of memories that is the cruelest loss of all in aging.I got the idea to recover some of mom's happy memories by bringing one of her travel albums with me on a recent visit.  The album I selected was from May 1990 when she traveled in Europe.  It was filled her typed and handwritten notes of scenes and the people pictured.  I thought she had done an excellent job of documenting the trip and it might be fun for her to see it again.She was initially happy to see the book - recognized the cover right away.  She seemed surprised to see her own handwriting - recognized it as hers - she said it looked like my handwriting.  I guess it does.It made me happy to watch her page slowly through the book.  She was quiet, however, and did not make many comments.  I asked if she recognized any of the places and people.  She said, \"some\" ... and that was all.  It was the first sign that maybe some memories of this happy time were lost.  I felt a little saddness at that thought.At times a small smile graced her lips - I assumed she recognized a scene or a person - maybe one of the pictures prompted another memory.  She did mention the name of the man who led the tours - so she did seem to connect with the images.Then she suddenly turned to me and said, \"This is your book, right?  There are some nice pictures of you in here.\"  No ... no pictures of me. The book was entirely of her travels.  Later it occurred to me that she was seeing pictures of a much younger self.  We are always told how much we look alike.  I guess she got confused. Another little red flag on memory lane.She reached the end and closed the book, leaning back in her chair and closing her eyes.  After a bit she mentioned that she did travel a lot at one time. But 1990 was a very long time ago. The comment seemed like simple confirmation of what the book represented.  She sat quitely some time.It was hard to tell how these pictures impacted her.  Did they make her sad at the passage of so much time?   Did it confirm that some of her memories were lost because she couldn't recognize some of the images from her book?  Was she just reflective?  I will never know because mom finds it hard to put her thoughts and feelings into words at this point.I hoped she would keep the book with her for a few days to enjoy and remember.  But she clearly wanted me to take the book back home that day.  She said she was glad that I brought it, but she would not keep it with her.My heart hoped she had a few moments of happiness paging through the photo album.  But the small voice of my mind wonders if these pictures had another unpredictable outcome.Memories are fragile things.

{"title": "V-Day", "date": "Tuesday, August 27, 2013", "text": "We are owned by 2 cats.  Our two boys are \"cat-cats,\" not \"dog-cats\".  Over 40+ years we have had cats that acted more like dogs. We assumed that all cats were dog-like.How can two reasonably intelligent and educated people be so wrong!Preamble:We spare no expense for our four legged family.  Soap box comments aside, I strongly believe that if you can't be a responsible, caring, loving pet mom or dad, you shouldn't have the privilege of being owned by pets. (please don't comment if you feel other wise)AND if you mistreat them, you should have the word \"Scum\" tattooed to your forehead so that we can easily identify you!  Opps!  Slipped briefly onto my soap box.  Stepping down now.Today was V-Day ... Vet Day!  We kept it a secret as long as possible from the participants.  But at some point the jig is up - and V-Day becomes common knowledge.Our story starts with the two very fancy travel cases on wheels that we have for these yearly trips to the vet.  They were pricey, BUT they are worth every single penny.  The cats seem calmer while traveling and it is easier on our aging backs.It also allows us to make a snooty entrance into the vet's waiting room - making a positive impression by looking spiffy, calm, cool, collected and blood free.  We always get comments on the cases.Money well spent, I tell you!But loading our boys into the cases at home can be tricky!  We haven't totally mastered that yet.WallyThe first cat is usually easy.  This time the first cat was Wally.  We pick him up, he is happy, purring ensues, and then ... plop ... we drop him into the case and zip him in.  Easy, peasy.  We are feeling masterful and in charge at that point.  Then Wally yowls a long loud cry, raising the alarm for his brother, Max, who gets the message with lightening speed and dives under the bed. (And it makes no difference who is picked up first.  They are brothers.  They work as a team in crisis situations.)Max*sigh*Now our focus is Max under the bed. We begin with softly worded cajoling (which never works, by the way), and then we move on to the \"cookie technique\" - cookies placed artfully in a line leading out from under the bed (which worked exactly one time 6 years ago and never since), and then the \"catnip offering\" which he dearly loves (making him totally manic if he imbibes, but on V-Day - he doesn't.)  We are finally reduced to the \"broom technique\" - sweeping it against his body to push him out where we can grab him (picture two 66-67 year old codgers laying on the floor beside the bed - one codger has markedly reduced vision - an elephant could pass by and he might miss it - the other is swearing mightily - totally annoyed at how dirty it is under our bed.)Really, it is not one of our finer moments!At some point, however, we succeed - but not without many swear words and sweat! The trip by car it uneventful ... if you agree that pitiful cries from the back seat and cat drool (due to motion sickness) are \"uneventful.\"The vet's exam is also fairly quiet.  The cats are docile making us look totally ridiculous as we stand there looking damp, layered with cat hair and carpet fuzz.  I guess the vet has seen worse.It is only once the vet take the cats to the back lab for blood work, urine samples, shots and nail trimming that the true state of affairs become evident.I mean, after all, imagine just how much fun it must be to take urine from a cat.  For example this time we had this scenario:  the technician returned with Max after the visit to the lab using one hand to wipe the side of her face.  I was immediately worried.  There didn't appear to be any scratches or blood.  She said things got kind of exciting in the lab.  While preparing to retrieve some urine (don't ask how they do that),  Max started to pee all over the place.  I had visions of a vet tech holding sample cup here and there - moving left and right - trying to catch the urine stream before it hit the ground.  What she was wiping off her face was cat urine. Some people are just not paid enough for what they do!!The return trip is always quiet.  The cats are exhausted and we much poorer!And every year on the return trip home I have the same nagging thoughts ... will they remember us when we come next year?   ... do we need to change our names?   ... is there any chance that there will be new staff who don't know us?  After all, those fancy travel cases can carry you only so far in the \"positive impression\" department.We know things could be worse.  Been there - done that!  Many years ago we had a cat named Alex whose chart was covered in very big red ink letters with stars and arrows - inside and out - pointing to one over-riding message.***ATTENTION******STAFF***Release cat to owners before totally recovered from anesthesia.Yes, Alex had issues!The vet frequently asked how we were able to manage a difficult cat like this at home.  He cautioned us that often cats with this kind of extreme behavior are euthanized.  I sincerely doubt he believed us when we told him that the cat was a cream puff at home. Oh well.  I prefer to think that Alex was just misunderstood.Rest in peace dear Alex.  We miss you.August 2013 is now under our belts.  No worries until August 2014.And between now and next V-Day I reaaallly need to clean under our bed!!!!"},

No way to know about injuries, but I am just hoping no one was killed.Not boring I guess.I did, however, visit a new Community Center just 10 minutes from my house.  Just 10 minutes away, only 2 years old, and I had absolutely no idea the building was even there.  (Do I live in a paper bag or what!)  They have a great indoor walking track and in this muggy hot weather, an indoor air conditioned track sounds just fine.  I prefer being outside but when conditions are so terrible that I can't take a deep breath - indoors I go!  They also have a state-of-the-art gym with great looking equipment.  Seniors (which I am), can use the gym for $25 a year!  How's that for a deal?  Use of the walking track is free!  Can't beat the price.My walking has taken quite a hit this summer.    Walking and breathing at the same time is kind of important!  But I am still loving my FibBit Flex.  That is why I am eager to find a viable option for walking indoors on these terrible days.At my dad's grave site.Several weeks ago I had a chance to visit my Dad's grave.  My sister and I were doing some planning on mom's behalf and it took us to his grave site.  He died in 1970.  Even after all these years, and after all the bad memories of my upbringing, it gave my heart a tug to see his name on the tomb stone. Rest in peace, dear dad.  Sorry I don't visit more often.  I know you were ill with alcoholism and when you lived there wasn't much help for that.  At least I have a few good memories and mementoes of your life.  I wish you had lived long enough to meet your grandchildren.  You would be proud of them.Finally, here is a picture I have been holding on to a bit.Easter at Brooke GroveI love this picture of mom with one of the activity coordinators dressed as an Easter bunny.  They really try to make the holidays grand for the residents.  Easter was a good day for mom.  Lately she has had days when she mostly sleeps.  Then other days she seems more alert.  She has Congestive Heart Failure and these up and down periods are fairly normal.  We just take each day as it comes. She has started to ask me again when she is \"going home.\"  It breaks my heart when she says that as I want to think she is content where she is.  Coming back home now is next to impossible.  She can't climb even one step and I have tons of them.  And her care has reached a level beyond my abilities.  So technically she is \"home.\"  During our last Family Meeting, the staff reported that mom seems \"content.\"  Maybe she is content  at times, but there must be a small part of her that is not content.  It continues to pain me.Guess there were a few topics to blog about after all!  :-)Hope you all are doing well this hot summer.  Be back again soon."},
{"title": "FitBit Flex", "date": "Monday, July 8, 2013", "text": "I have a new pedometer as of the middle of June.  My daughter gifted me a FitBit Flex for Mother's Day. FitBit FlexPhoto Credit: http://www.fastcodesign.comLong time readers know that I have struggled with maintaining a walking program.  Walking is my preferred form of exercise.  There is nothing like slipping out the door for a quick (or long) walk with my iPod playing my current audio book or just enjoying a beautiful morning when the weather is inviting.  It beats gathering my stuff for a trip to a gym, getting in the car and driving, parking, waiting for time on equipment, etc. etc. etc.  But my success at keeping to a walking program has been spotty.So walking it is.It is helpful for me to have a quantitative measure of how active I am.  It keeps me honest.  It pushes me to do better.  My tool for doing that has always been a pedometer.  And I have had a bunch of them.My new favorite pedometer is the Fit Bit Flex - for a lot of reasons.The model is worn on the wrist. It only comes off to be charged.It tracks just about everything, but steps are my interest.  There is, however,  no face with numbers - just a small line of 5 lights.  I don't miss seeing the numbers at all.  If I am curious, I just open my phone, hit the App Icon, the device syncs automatically - and there is my total.  In fact, I think I prefer not having those numbers staring at me on the device.  It takes the pressure off for achieving a certain number ... but keeps me moving all the same.When I reach my goal - for me it is 10,000 steps - the lights flash and the band vibrates.  Pretty cool, as well.The device is meant to sync to your computer or Smart Phone.  This can happen automatically when within a certain range of your computer or phone, or you can manually sync when you log on to your phone or computer.  This feature is pretty awesome.Step totals do not roll of memory after 7 days like many pedometers.  The totals are out there when you want to see them.The battery must be recharged every 6 to 7 days.The device is water proof - apparently you can even shower with it.It can also be set to track the quality of your sleep - a very cool feature.Because it syncs to a free website, you can have \"friends\" and can easily see how they are doing.  You can even send messages back and forth.And it appears to be very accurate.There are many features I haven't even touched on - more features I use - but I will say this is the best pedometer that I have ever used.  It's a winner. So, if any of you great folks are already FitBit users and are looking for a new \"friend\" to help inspire you to walk, please let me know."},
{"title": "One last yarn-y stash post: a question!", "date": "Sunday, July 7, 2013", "text": "Picture credit: www.galenfrysinger.comNo, this is not my yarn stash!  But this is what my yarn stash feels like and resembles on occasion.  And this is what I spent time trying to fixing this week.My current organizational system is not even as systematic as this picture, but I do try to get it all to fit in one full size closet.  When new yarn comes into the house, it gets stacked on a card table until it can be logged in Ravelry and I have time to problem solve where it will go. The card table is just a temporary option.  You see I share that room with my husband who visits daily to work on his computer.  When he enters the room everything usually looks, well ... normal.  The yarn stash is mostly not visible.  He knows better than to open the closet (he did that only once and quickly slammed it closed before he lost control of the contents and needed to send out an SOS!)  As long as my hobby stays safely contained in a confined space that is seldom viewed, he can claim plausible deniability.  His wife is still normal and may need to (on occasion) buy more yarn.  :-)Really ... he is mentally just fine, but \"out-of-sight, out-of-mind\" plays big in our house.It is a method that works for us!But back to the storage issues:  I did manage to get all my cotton yarn together (gosh I have a lot of cotton yarn,) all my weaving yarn together (ditto on the weaving yarn), and all my wool fiber together.  Oh, that's right.  I haven't talked about my wool fiber stash! Once I am spinning will be  ... wait for it ... yarn! (See why I didn't talk about it?)All the other skeins are stored wherever there is a space in the closet plastic drawers or in plastic bags squeezed in spaces between the drawers.  I try to make sure I use bags that you can see through - so I don't have to dig too far to find stuff. Plastic may save me from the horrors of a stray moth setting up housekeeping in my collection. (Dread beyond measure!)But as a \"Collector\" of yarn, this storage system seems chaotic and disrespectful to my stash.I would love to hear how you manage your storage of anything - we all store stuff, we all have our methods, even if you aren't a yarn hoarder collector like me.  How do you do it?  What are the challenges you have and what have you done to overcome it?"},
{"title": "Knitting and a Confession", "date": "Thursday, July 4, 2013", "text": "I am a knitter!  I dabble in a number of other fiber related crafts - but if I could choose exactly one activity to be stranded with me on an isolated tropical island ... it would be knitting.  I wouldn't be able to wear any of my creations because tropical islands are hot and knitting produces warm garments but no matter!That is not my confession.This year I have several project goals - all of them are pretty big.I finished my mom's shawl. The story of why this shawl was pushed to the top of my project list can be found at this post.  It just needs a few ends woven in and blocking.  I wish this was a shawl that I could leave with mom all the time - but Assisted Living laundry is unforgiving.  Everything gets cleaned using much heat and agitation - which is 'death' to wool.  So the shawl will make periodic visits only.  I am still thinking about buying some beautiful acrylic for a shawl that she can keep with her - but extending my project list is a low priority ... and buying more yarn is not ... *sigh* ... well, more about that later.This is also not my confession.My daughter's lace shawl (with fingering weight yarn and #1 needles - (yes, #1 needles - who the heck makes a shawl out of toothpicks - and before you say - use bigger needles - the pattern suggested #0 needles - insane I say!!!) .... anyway, I get distracted.  My daughter's lace shawl was about 8 inches in depth when I decided that:  1)  I couldn't live with the small errors I had made,   2) that I would always see those irregularities and be bothered by them,   3)  that I would forever cringe when Kris would proudly tell people that her mother made the shawl,  4) that is OK to be anal and want perfection.  So I ripped it all out and started again.  Here is my second try.And just for the record:  I am an Aries.  That means I am stubborn, bull headed, persistent and ornery.  I have no intention of letting this thread-like yarn and tiny tiny needles best me!I have also started a Faery Ring jacket for my cousin, Leslie.  It is in the beginning stages but the process has begun. All together now ... no, this is not her confession.There are two other projects - my own sweater and a pair of socks - that are on the needles, but are not picture worthy yet.  There are a few other projects on my list, but they are not even close to getting cast on the needles.Now for the confession.My yarn stash!  For my non-knitting readers: a yarn stash is a bunch yarns (or fibers, or cloth ...) that is owned by you but not presently being used.  It might have projects assigned to them, or it might be yarn that you just had to own because you physically could not walk away from it.  Most knitters have a stash of yarn.  Most knitters have enough years left in their lives to use up their stash of yarn.Then there is me!About 2 years ago I did an inventory.  I listed the yarn by maker, weight, and color - I also noted how many yards I had of each entry.Two years ago that yardage number was 143,000 yards - (pause for gasps).  For non-knitters that is about 79 miles of yarn (the gasps grow in volume).  And based on using about 5,000 yards of yarn a year (equal to about 2 sweaters and several smaller projects), I would have enough yarn to last me 28 years even if I never bought another skein of yarn (pause for a belly laugh - mine, of course.)  I was however, appalled at the quantity of yarn I had amassed.  It was a bit embarrassing.  The total would slowed my acquisition of yarn!  I was glad I did the inventory.One year ago I updated my inventory - deleting yarns I had used and adding new ones.  Remarkably my yardage total was now 156,000+ yards or 88 miles of yarn.  That is an increase of 13,000 yards.  13,000 YARDS more yarn!!  GASP!  Just not possible!  Now I could live another 31 years without running out of yarn - (time for math:  I was 65 then so I wouldn't run out until I was 96 years old.)  I did some soul searching.  If that yarn was not developing gonads (I haven't entirely ruled that out yet) and increasing yarn babies on its own - then I had bought all those 13,000 yards. So I did the only reasonable thing I could think of.  I decided that I was no longer a stasher of yarn - I was a \"collector\" of yarn.  That sounded so much better.  Yes, a Collector - with a capital C!  I would still be cautious in my purchases, but as a serious \"Collector\", I was \"normal\" (an important word) - adding only unique selections to my \"collection.\"Normal! (Is anyone else \"buying\" my assessment of this yarn stashing problem?)This week I updated my inventory again.  (I really need to stop doing that!) Let see hands of how many think the inventory has gone down (great wasteland of silence!) You are right, it went up.Let see hands of how many think the inventory increased less than before (great wasteland of silence!!)You are right, it went up alot!  (and I hate that you knew this!)Drum roll please.My current inventory of yarns is 188,475 yards, 107 miles of yarn ... I could live to be 104 years old before I run out of yarn.  HOLY COW!  I increased my yarn from last year by 34,475 yards!  (and secretly I think I missed a few yards in this count - but whose counting, right?)I am now past \"soul searching.\"  That was a worthless endeavor. I am now in survival mode.  I am still just a Collector (yes, I am), but if I reach 200,000 yards by this time next year - I will need to change my title from Yarn Collector to Yarn Store Owner or Hoarder! I vote for Yarn Store Owner - a unique yarn store where I don't sell any of my inventory.  Yes, that is it!  A unique store owner that does not sell stuff!! Unique is still normal, right?*sigh*Well, that is all for now.  Need to get knitting.Also need to shop for some nice acrylic yarn for my mom's shawl!(Oh my, did I say that out loud?)Don't you hate it ... when you discover a vendor you patronize ... a vendor with a charming name for their business ... a name that triggers memories of an idyllic setting ... a name that in your mind's eye you want to visit to just get away ... don't you hate it when you find out that this vendor is not anything like the name they have picked???Well ...that is most definitely not the case with Kiparoo Farm. Kiparoo Farm is even better than my mind's eye imagined.  My sister and I made the trip to visit Kiparoo Farm this past weekend.  This is an actual working farm where sheep graze and cows are milked.  And it is only about one hour from my house.Kiparoo FarmAnnie Kelley3511 Bussard RoadMiddletown, MD 21769301-371-7454kiparoofarmstudio.usI have been a yearly visitor to their fair stand at The Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival.  I own a lovely selection of their yarns.This wonderful farm is located in rural Maryland. The farm house serves as the home and studio for Annie Kelley who is the owner of the Kiparoo Farm yarn brand.  The yarn is from her sheep.  She freely talks about her life as a farmer - and as a milker of cows.  And her enthusiasm for her life and craft is infectious!This farm dates back to the 1700s and she says there is actually one very dilapidated building on the grounds from that time.  The farm house was built in the 1800s. She is surrounded by beautiful rolling farm country.The first floor of the house has 3 rooms that serve as her studio.  But through all the windows, glimpses of the farm can be seen.  Of course, for knitters like my sister and I, the yarn is the star of the show.  One of my favorites is her Silk Road - 50% Marino Wool, 50% Silk.  There is little that compares to the feel of this yarn.The colors of this yarn were so much better in person!Darn camera!It goes without saying that I bought some yummy yarn.  A wonderful cotton called Celtic Cotton now has a new home with me.  The moment I saw it I knew that some of this great stuff was going to be mine.This cotton is machine wash and dry.  It is spun around a central core that prevents the cotton from sagging - something that cotton is prone to  do.All of her yarns have pattern support - and samples of the patterns are on display in the studio.The basic patterns are well written and attractively presented. The farm even has a mission statement ...Amazingly, I did not get any pictures of the sheep or the cows!  Go figure!  But I know I will be making this trip again and will correct that omission.  It would be a wonderful day trip when my cousins come to visit.Thank you Annie Kelley for your gracious assistance - spending much precious time away from your farm duties with my sister and I.  Our visit was memorable."},

This second little toilet is sitting in my bathroom tub.  I guess that is an improvement over the kitchen because I could always do my business on it and at least it wouldn't leak out onto the floor! The third little toilet in the second full bathroom looks just like this one.  I won't bore you with that picture.So for anyone who is counting, we have exactly one functioning toilet and it is located in the basement (my third full bathroom is there.) I guess this is an improvement over going outside to an outhouse to do the deed, but our bedroom is located on the top floor and our one functioning toilet is located 2 floors down.   My husband and I are both 66 and cannot be too far from the bathroom for those random visits in the middle of the night.  You old fogies out there get my drift, I am sure. So my dear husband and I are sleeping on our pull out couch that is only one floor removed from the one functioning toilet!  Our bladders are happier about this, but our backs are less than thrilled.All of this inconvenience is because my 28 year old tile floor was broken and ugly and it needed to go!!!  So without thinking about the ramifications of doing 3 bathrooms all at once, we scheduled the work.  The picture above shows the tile - minus the grout.  Tomorrow, they say they will finish the job.I can't even just close the bathroom doors and pretend everything is normal ... because the bathroom doors have been removed and are propped up in my dust filled third floor.  (Did I tell you just how dusty ceramic tile instillation can be? I don't think my allergies will let me sleep up there until I do a complete cleaning.)  My back may be happier in my own bed, but my sinuses will create a major conflict of enormous proportions if I try to sleep upstairs right now.My bladder, my back, my sinuses ... all so that I can have new bathroom floors.I suffer so!:-)"},

{"title": "Through My Caregiver Eyes - the Law of Loss", "date": "Friday, May 31, 2013", "text": "It has been some time since I did a post on my mom under the continuing series of Through My Caregiver Eyes.  New readers can find other posts in this series under the Through My Caregiver Eyes label (Section to the right of my blog posts.)  The short summary:  Concern for my mom started when she was around age 78.  She was independent but red flags began to flicker in my awareness.The path from independence to living in my home, and finally Assisted Living is documented in this series.  While our journey through mom's aging is peppered with joy-filled moments, it is mostly continuing losses for her and increasing sadness for me. For those of you who are caregivers of elderly loved ones, you will see yourself in this story.We are all sisters and brothers under the skin. There should be a law...I propose that as we age our age-related losses be limited to a fixed number ... let say 5 or 10 ... and no more.  More losses than that from a life spent building and growing is a cruel and unusual punishment for the aging person and the caregiver.My case in point:The sky is blue, the wind is calm:Forgetting namesThoughts that frequently escape in mid-sentenceOrnery left arthritic knee is more orneryThe horizon gets cloudy:The checkbook won't balanceDecision making becomes a major hurdleLearning how to do new things like email is never achieved.Clouds obscure the sun, the wind is picking up:Social circle shrinks because friends either move away or dieOutside activities become limitedFamily begins to worry about your drivingLiving independently becomes a question in the minds of loved onesYou begin to prune down your belongings for a future move.The prediction is for stormy weather:You move in with family -  independence is lost forever.You require oversight for paying your bills.You take a fall but no major damage is done.Reaching out to distance friends and family is less frequent.Your car is finally not your car any more - that freedom is lost forever.Health problems cause hospitalizations and rehabilitations - trouble free health is lost forever.You become a familiar face at the local hospital.Emergency Medical Technicians become more frequent guests.You walk with a cane.  Walking without assistance is lost forever.Thunder and lightening begins to fill the sky:You fall again.  This time you injure yourself.You move into Assisted Living - seeing family becomes less frequent.Your daughters take over complete control of your medical and financial affairs.Making new friends is harder and harder.Hobbies and past times like TV and reading no longer hold your interest.You walk with a walker. You are labeled a \"fall risk.\"The storm is here and intensity is growing:The recliner now is your best friend - even more than your TV.Sleeping is your main activity - even staying awake for company is very hard.Medical issues become the major focus of your family.Walking even short distances is tough.The wheel chair is the safest way to travel.This much loss should be illegal.  Last Sunday as mom and I were leaving Mass, she said she wasn't sure she could make it to the car.  The walk was painfully slow, with many stops to rest.  I suggested next time we take the wheel chair - she weakly nodded.  We made it to the car.  She then told me she didn't think she could go to church on Sunday any more.  I am not a church-going Christian, but for 15 years I have taken her to church every Sunday because going to Mass was so important to her.  Her words made me want to cry.  As I write these words my eyes fill with tears.Another loss.       Retired Knitter      Daughter and Caregiver"},

I'm thinking of something you saw all of the time, like a picture, clock, statue, teapot. or some thing that was always there.1.  How old was \"old\" when I was a child?  I think considered 40 to be old.   And if my son happens to be reading this post ... it still is old, my dear boy.  Oh, and I hope you have a Happy Birthday this September.  You will be how old?  Now let me think.  I was there so I should know.  Oh, yes, I remember now ... 40!!!:-)  That felt good.  Glad that was one of the questions!!2.  How often do I have dessert?  Every darn chance I can.  I don't want to get to the end of my life thinking - oh, why did I pass up that Boston Cream Pie for boiled carrots!3.  What is your favorite kind of exercise?  Walking.  I should be doing it more.  And second to that is knitting.  My fingers get such a work out.4.  Do you watch movies on TV, movies from a rental or the library, or movies online?  We mostly watch movies from a rental.  No commercials, on when I want it to be on, and no trips out of the house to get them - delivered by the post office.  Sometimes we watch movies online, but it seems like the ones we want to see are most readily on disk only.5.  Tell me something about your grandparents' house?  Gosh, I had to think about that one a bit because I only saw them at their house - maybe once a year.  I think the thing I most remember (and sometimes dream about) was my grandparents' porch.  It was a screen in porch - not all that remarkable, but when our family would come to visit (we lived in another state), my dad would sleep out on the porch.  I think they had a big rocker.Well that is it for this Tuesday chat.  I don't always participate, because I am trying to become more of a free soul - not tied down to stuff like I always seem to do.  There are things in my life that tie me down in a big way, so on the little stuff - I like to keep my options open.  But these questions were fun this time, especially #1!!!"},
{"title": "I am naive!", "date": "Saturday, May 25, 2013", "text": "I just made an unsettling discovery.Last year I joyfully deleted my Facebook account.  I was frustrated with Facebook but mostly I needed to just get away from a few \"time wasters\" - Facebook in my life was a time waster.For those who are curious - there are two levels of Facebook separation.  I can't remember their exact names but here is what I remember from last year:First level: you have put yourself in a \"temporary time out.\"  You aren't really serious about leaving.  You want a breather.  You might want to come back again, just not sure.  You want to hold onto your account and all the contacts and information ... but you might want to say \"Good Riddens\" .. just not sure!  I did that once and came back.Second level: you are permanently deleting this account.  You are done, done done with Facebook forever.  Your screen name, friends, pictures ... all the details of your account will be gone . permanently . not to be recalled . not ever not never again.   This is a final action that cannot be recalled.  You cannot change your mind!!  Be sure you want to do that before you hit the \"submit\" button.  I hit that button last year.  I was done, done, done with Facebook.Facebook lied.  Apparently Facebook isn't done with me.My account was never gone AND just the past month I started getting Facebook updates from friends in my email.  I didn't pay much attention at first.  I saw the word \"Facebook\" in my in box and I just deleted it.  I was done done done with Facebook!  I was deleted . permanently . finally, forever and ever.  Facebook told me so.Then I discovered that not only is everything still out there, but my account was ACTIVATED and not by me!!Everything is still out there and shows just like it did before.  Very very odd.  So I promptly went out and changed my password - 'cause maybe I was hacked!  BUT there shouldn't have been anything out there to hack!  My account was deleted . permanently . finally . forever and ever! Done!!Ok, it is now terribly evident to everyone reading this post that I am very naive and nothing on the Internet is ever totally gone.I'll try again later to delete this account.  Right now I am afraid to go out to my account - because I will get sucked back in to that \"black hole\" that I call Facebook.  *sigh*"},
{"title": "10 Years - Then and Now", "date": "Thursday, May 23, 2013", "text": "Have you ever looked back to the person you were 10 years ago and pondered,\"Wow, who the heck was that person?\"  I was 56 and didn't like it. Aging was a negative thing. My retirement was planned to be travel, crafts, friendships, and fun.I was more interested in pleasing everyone - keeping the peace, putting other's needs first, submerging my opinions and ideas to those offered by others.I was a \"yes\" person - without regard to the impact it would have on me and the quality of my life.  I was a working full time professional with respect, higher income and responsibility ... at the cost of my personal time and my family's needs.  I was not a caregiver. My inner voice believed that mom would age gracefully and remain independent keeping both her mental and physical status in tack.I loved my townhouse even then and didn't desire a bigger and bigger home.My body and mind were sound - I assumed only the best in the future.\"Today\" was only a path to the \"future:\"  things to buy, future vacations to take, to-do lists to manage.  I never seemed to think \"in the present! 10 years has changed my perspective:66 is pretty darn young!  I like 66 a whole lot!!!  It is as young as I am ever going to be. Aging is my reward for not dying!My retirement is filled with friends and some pretty good stuff  - but travel isn't one of them.  In fact, even day trips are problematical due to disabilities.\"Doing more\" is highly overrated!  Less is better.  I enjoy the present more when less is on my plate.My working life is history. My personal life is my focus. Thankfully not too much damage was done by my obsession with work in the past.With the exception of my mom, I am less interested in pleasing anyone.  Sounds stunningly selfish, I know, but healthier for me. No one looks out for me, better than me.  \"No\" is a good word, if I am over committed, not interest and/or \"just don't wanna.\"  I am my mom's caregiver.  Her decline and loss of independence is the hardest thing I have ever watched.  I still love my townhouse.  Fewer stairs and less space would be nice, but nothing is perfect.My body?  In my 60s I got a more realistic view of the nature of the human body - what it can do, how long it is meant to last, and how much work it takes to keep it up.   I don't assume it will last forever and I accept the fact it will look different.Today, this minute, is the most important time! It is all I can count on. What a difference 10 years can make! I don't think any other 10 years in my life have taught me so much.I can hardly wait to see what my perspective is in 10 more years.I am glad the person of 10 years ago is gone.  Whatever was she thinking?Maybe she was thinking this ..."},
{"title": "Retired Knitter's Corner of the World", "date": "Monday, May 20, 2013", "text": "Boy, when you don't blog daily, stuff backs up.  Hard to know if any of this stuff is of interest ... but no matter.  Here is an update from my corner of the world ...The Year of House ImprovementsAfter years of putting off, and putting off, and putting off  - we have finally decided to do more than just clean the house!  It started in the spring with trimming the yard and mulching.  Mulch makes everything look better.  And then a new front storm door was installed today.  Coming up we are replacing 3 bathroom floors and some window screens.  Let's not forget the defective bathroom mirror upstairs that has to go, and the light over the kitchen sink that was cheap and ugly (and new) when we moved in 28 years ago - and has not improved with age.  Finally the aluminum siding is DIRTY and GREEN (neither color is light gray the siding was born to be) so a pressure wash is in our future.  Who knows, if I get on a roll this year I might do some of next year's things - interior house painting, 28 year old carpeting that needs to go, kitchen cabinets that have out lived their usefulness.  We put so much stuff off for so long that we are now facing change after change after change.This year I added some color to my simple uncluttered external environments.  I have bushes, trees, mulch and some brick.  That is it!  Simple, uncluttered, easy to maintain.  But I love nurseries.  I love picking out plants, putting them in pots, watering and fertilizing them, pinching off the spent blossoms, talking to them over the morning coffee - I haven't done this for awhile but it lifts my spirits.  After my frustrating Mother's Day ... I needed a little spirit lifting.  But I do feel sorry for these small gentle blossoms because they were adopted by the killer of green things ... just saying.The Mother's Day that wasn't ...Mother's Day was an \"up and down\" event for me. It was Sunday so that meant church with mom, which was an \"up\" because it is so important to her.  And lunch with her at Assisted Living was an \"up\" - the food there is great.  But her allergies were making her miserable - a \"down,\" and I discovered her allergy meds were discontinued at some point in the worst allergy season in years - a \"great big down\" for both of us, and her legs seemed to freeze up at times making her very unsteady - another \"down\" that worried me quite a bit.  Then there was the sour \"icing on the cake\" -  I discovered that a beautiful hand woven wool shawl (shown in the picture) I made for her a few years ago had been accidentally machine washed and dried by the staff.  It was now a napkin!  You can't machine wash and machine dry wool.  Big fat \"no no\" unless you want a felted napkin.  Mom loved that shawl when I gave it to her and she enjoyed it mostly during the winter months when she would get cold.  She doesn't know it is gone.  Reduced mental functioning has saved her from this disappointment.  I was, however, upset enough for both of us. By the time I got home my kids were on to other commitments - that was OK - I was focused on getting some of mom's medical issues corrected.  And I had the company of my kids earlier in the weekend.My daughter ordered me a FitBit Pedometer for Mother's Day which will come in June and I am totally excited about it.  And my son and daughter-in-law made a lasagna for our Sunday dinner before they left for the evening.  That was totally yummy and I didn't have to cook. Big thumbs up on that!!I guess the ups and downs finally balanced out this Mother's Day. My Crafing Life ...I treated myself to a new set of Interchangeable knitting needles by Knitter's Pride - LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these needles.  Go out and buy them.  Buy them even if you don't knit.  :-)  I started a new shawl for mom right away using these needles, and I love the feel of them.  I am using the same yarn as the woven shawl for mom's new shawl - except I added a strand of purple yarn to boost the color.  I am pleased with the product so far. But the knitting list has got to stop growing.  Here is my 2013 list:Mom's shawl - 10% doneMy Autumnal Cardigan: - 40% doneMy daughter Leaf Lace Shawl - 0% done - but working on the guage swatch My cousins' Faery Ring Jacket - 0%My son's Dr. Zoidberg hood and mittens - 0% doneMy Walking World ...Walking is going ok - in a not-so-ok sort of way!!  :-)Ok ... in that I am not giving up, and I am walking at least a few days a week, and I am getting my step counts up, and I feel better now than that day several weeks ago when I went for the first walk and felt like death! Not-so-ok ... in that I am not yet walking 5 times a week and I don't reach 10,000 steps every single day.  But I hit 7,000 to 8,000 steps a day most days.  That is better than the 4,000 to 5,000 I was doing.So this post is the iceberg of my life - the pieces that are showing. Hope your corner of the world is treating you well."},
{"title": "Making Room", "date": "Tuesday, May 14, 2013", "text": "The constant internal theme of my life seems to be \"Make Room.\"  It has almost become a mantra.Clear those counters.Pick up those items.Give away stuff.Pitch that clutter.Step down from leadership.The last example is the newest in the ever expanding theme.  When do you feel that your stuff and your life's activities comfortably equals the space and the time given to you? Over the last few years I have focused on the obvious!  Make my environment less cluttered.  As I look around my kitchen I have a long way to go.  It is hard to wrap my mind around what life would be like right now if I held on to everything I discarded over the last 4 years.  Flashes of The Hoarders - a TV show about folks who can't let go of anything - pops into my mind.  The \"de-clutter bug\" is starting to eat away at me again.  I can feel another purge coming on soon.Today I am focusing on the less obvious.Time and guilt.  Today I will be telling my Knitting Group that I am stepping down as their coordinator and handing over that role to another member.  This group holds a special place in my heart.  They are fun, interesting, non-judgemental, supportive, creative (big time creative) and welcoming.  They supported me through my most difficult days in caring for my mom.  My hope is that today ... after I tell them this news, they will be happy for me. This change will allow me the flexibility to \"drop in\" as a fellow participant rather than be the linch pin that connects everyone.  I've missed too many meetings this spring - time continues to be a commodity  in short supply.  I need to make room in my life to participate in this wonderful group - without the guilt that comes when I miss meetings.They are wonderful people.  They will understand!Fingers crossed!"},

God!  Is it Tuesday again?  Wasn't it Tuesday just yesterday?(gets up and checks the paper calendar on the wall)Ok, guess not! Time once again to visit on the farmhouse porch - the porch of Everyday Ruralty.QuestionsWhen it's time to cut the grass (mow the lawn), who does it?Ha!!  We have no lawn.  Problem fixed.  When we moved here we decided to cover the front yard with landscaping and mulch.  The back yard is a brick patio and mulch.  No pesky grass.  I should note, however, that we have a stamp size front and back yard since we live in a townhouse community. :-) Our \"fix\" wouldn't work for most people.  We are very happy NOT being large land owners.  If someone gave you $500 dollars, and you could not spend it on yourself, who would you spend it on?I would spend it on my mom who currently lives in Assisted Living.  It would pay for only 2 days of care but I can't think of another person who deserves (and needs) my help more in that regard.  Her life was never flush with assets.  She saved and led a frugal life, and now we are blowing through that savings with breath taking speed for her Assisted Living.  It makes me sad.  She lived with me for 5 years prior to being admitted to Assisted Living.  You can find our story together on my blog at Through My Caregiver Eyes label.  My experience was not a traditional \"sandwich generation\" story ... my kids were grown and on their own, but my life with mom mirrors many of the struggles that others have faced.  Have you ever taken a blogging break or considered one?Funny you should ask.  I just came off a considerable blogging break (about 2 months).  Blogging breaks sort of catch me by surprise.  I don't know they are coming.  All of a sudden I notice that it has been a week, then two, and before I know it an official break from blogging has occurred.  This last break was the longest.  I couldn't get in gear to write even one word, although ideas would pop up in my head, and I would say to myself ... yes, I should blog about that ... and then I wouldn't.  I am back now but never say never with regards to blogging breaks.Are you bothered by spring allergies or hay fever? If not spring, any other time of the year?Yes, year round, in door and out door!  And if I could be more compliant in taking my allergy meds, my life would be more peaceful.  What's new with you?Nothing. I lead a very busy but boring life.   All I can say at this point is ... tomorrow better not be TUESDAY!!!"},
{"title": "A book from my nightstand", "date": "Saturday, April 27, 2013", "text": "My nightstand is was filled with books I wasn't reading (blogging was not the only thing I wasn't doing.)  If I wasn't blogging or reading blogs, maybe I should be reading some of my many books! So many books!  Gosh, there must be something in this stack that can capture my attention.What a waste!!I pitched a bunch of them ... titles that were worthy of buying many moons ago seemed boring and irrelevant now.And then I picked out Amish Peace: Simple Wisdom for a Complicated World, by Suzanne Woods Fisher.I can't remember when I got this book ... but it was a theme that caught my attention sometime in the past, and I wanted to sit down and read it right now ... so I did.Amish Peace is filled with short chapters about the central themes of Amish life.  Each chapter includes Amish proverbs and facts about the Amish community told through the words of real Plain People.  Each theme shows how less can result in more ... more peace!Simplicity of life style, respect for time, focus on family and community ... are a few of the themes concisely covered in this small book.  Although \"going Amish\" is outside the realm of reality (in fact it is nearly impossible), their wisdom is definite something to be emulated.In my own life, I have used a few tried and true methods to simplify and add more peace to my own life.Back down external commitments to create more down time.De-clutter my environment to make my world seem less \"busy\" and stressful.But that is just the tip of the iceberg for the Amish culture.  There is so much more to learn from these people who have managed to successfully live in a way that is simply contrary to \"the American way of thinking.\"As quoted by \"Uncle Amos,\" an Amish man who wrote occasionally for the Small Farmer's Journal:\"If you admire our faith, strengthen yours.  If you admire our sense of commitment, deepen yours.  If you admire our community spirit, build your own.  If you admire the simple life, cut back.  If you admire deep character and enduring values, live them yourself.\"Well said, Uncle Amos!Blessed are they who have nothing to say, and can't be persuaded to say it.He who has no money is poor; he who has nothing but money is poorer.Use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without.A task takes as long as it takes.Enjoy today.  It won't come back."},

There are many articles, books, and movies on topics like allergies, GMO, pesticide use, bad or no labeling, over processed foods, foods from other countries that may not have high standards, and many more topics. What concerns you the most? If nothing concerns you, have a cookie and skip to the next question.  Guess I am pretty trusting about my food and the suppliers.  I am sure there are issues, but I am 66 and have eaten pretty freely without regard to food safety (other than making sure to avoid spoilage or undercooking), and I haven't had any problems.  I am trying to eat less processed foods and more fruits and veggies, but that is it.Do you use nail polish often? Finger nails, piggies, or both?  Never.  All my nails are a mess.  I am not fussy in that regard."},

(I guess that shouldn't be a shocker, but it was.)  I missed writing.  I missed visiting blogs.  I missed being visited.I missed stuff!  All kinds of stuff.  Stuff like:                           A good blogger friend was hospitalized!  Double yikes!!   So sorry, HappyOne.                   Another blogger friend returned to blogging after a long absence like me.  Welcome back                             Noofy.                   One blogging friend just picked up everything and moved away.  Wow,                             Diane, when you make a change you don't mess around.                   My cousin who knits, spins, and weaves ... knits, spins and weaves rings around me!                            Talk about productive, Linda.  (So I clarify a bit.  This isn't new behavior for her.                             She has been doing it for a long time.  But sitting on your own butt for 2 months                             exacerbates the impact of her creative output. )  Hangs head in shame.I panicked a bit when Google Reader announced their departure.  They were my blog post capture tool. Oh my God!!  How will I keep up with everyone?  (... that is after I stop blinking) But now I subscribe to blogs by email - a much more civilized method of keeping up with blog posts.  So \"good riddens\" Google Reader - I blinked, you bowed out, and my blog life improved!  So there, Goggle Reader! Going forward I need to be more reasonable about blogging - so I can avoid the \"blink\" effects.Blog on a semi- regular schedule.  At least once a week sounds good - thanks for the idea, Noofy.Limit blog subscriptions.  It is totally unrealistic to have over 500 outstanding blog posts to read.  And, seriously, that was the number when I was brave enough to peak at Google Reader during the blink.Subscribe to blogs by email -  I get new posts each day a little at a time.  Really, folks, that has been refreshing!Woo Hoo!Glad to be back ... even if I am talking to myself only after all this timeand all you guys have moved on to otherswho don't have blink issues.:-)"},

Yep, that is the real failure.November, December and January have been very busy months in our house.  Holiday activities and new family adjustments have been my excuses so far.  Now faced with February - and no barriers (unless I make something up), it seems time to begin.So we start again!And actually, \"starting again\" on February 1st rather than January 1 is perfect!  Woo Hoo!!  Who starts stuff on February 1st?  Pretty much no one - so I have no competition!How are your January 1 resolutions going?  Do you need to start again February 1st?

{"title": "The Beach and The Snow", "date": "Tuesday, January 29, 2013", "text": "Last weekend I was at the beach!I love the beach.I love my cousin.I love snow.It was a win-win weekend for me!My cousin is part owner of a lovely condo right on the beach.  This was a regularly scheduled craft weekend and it was just perfect.These pictures were taken from the balcony.  We are close to the ocean.Although I love the beach in any season, my least favorite season for beach visits is the summer.  See I am a selfish beach bunny.  I want to look out on the beach and see no one!  Just the sand, and the water ... that is it.  And if you go in January, snow is also welcome.The next day the snow was gone and we were left with a beautiful scene.And as the moon began to rise, we tried to get pictures.  I say \"try\".  Because as much as I tried, I couldn't get a picture without the rays off the moon.No matter.  The view was beautiful.Tomorrow ... the results of 2 days of uninterrupted craft time.Pictures of the hand woven scarf for the give away - also included.Be sure to comment on my blog sometime between January 18 and 31 to be entered into a drawing to win it.Details found here.Today I am visiting on Patrice's farmhouse porch.This is a feature every Tuesday on everydayruralty.com, a new blog I am following. Every Tuesday there are a list of questions that each participant answers.These chats are all about getting to know others and hopefully, they get to know you.So here goes...QuestionsHave you ever been on a boat? (Motor boat, sail boat, cruise ship, ark, or Good Ship Lollipop).Do you need an alarm to wake up in the morning, or do you wake up naturally? If you have an alarm, tell us what type.Have you ever had a yard sale?Do you like kitchen gadgets? What are some of your favorite?Do you read labels at the grocery store?Have you ever been on a boat?  Lordy, yes.  Many times but motion sickness is a problem.  Good boats - cruise ships with stabilizers and medical staff who dispense nausea meds.  Bad boats: motor boats, sail boats and mid size ships - like the ones that take you out to whale watch!  I remember one whale watching trip.  The ride out wasn't so bad.  The waiting and waiting for a whale to poke his head or tail above the water was painfully difficult.  Gently swaying, gently drifting, up and down, side to side, with nothing happening ... except I wanted  to vomit over the side of the boat!  For some reason on that day the whales weren't cooperating with the tourist ship.  And the ship was scheduled to stay in place until some whale made a guest appearance.  I remember praying as I hung over the boat, Dear God: Please .... pleeeaase, send whales!  Send someone is a whale costume.  Oh heck, please send a rogue wave that forces us back to shore.  The trip back to shore was terrible too - they were serving greasy burgers on this tourist boat, AND PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY EATING THEM!!  Do you need an alarm to walk up in the morning?  Apparently not.  I must have some internal clock that pops my eyes open around the time I need to get up - no matter what time that is.  It is a spooky talent, I can tell you.Have you ever had a yard sale?  Yes when I was much younger.  When I worked out the hours I devoted to the preparation, the sale, and the clean up ... against what I earned in sales, I made about .87 cents an hour.  No more yard sales for me.Do you like kitchen gadgets?  Well I don't like to cook, but I do have 2 favorite kitchen gadgets.  My coffee maker.  Makes it possible for me to form complete sentences about 30 minutes later.  And my microwave.  Makes it possible for me to heat up food made by others!Do you read labels at the grocery store?  You betcha!  But the best foods of all are the ones that don't have labels: fruit, veggies, etc.  Well, that sure was fun.  Now off to check out some of the other blogs in the porch chat!"},

Last year we had a serious talk in March about your winter performance.  It was dismal.As a big fan of winter, I felt absolutely compelled last year to point out your deficiencies with regards to  snow falls.  And here we are again, having the same talk this year.Surely you don't think the snow I woke to this morning was adequate!Is one inch really the best that you can do?Are you becoming just a bit lazy in doing your winter duties?So it is only mid-January.  You still have plenty of time to correct this situation ... but I will be watching, and if things don't improve in the next month or so ... well ... don't make me go there!!Get crack'en!  Drop a foot or two of the snowy goodness around here ... and I will get off your back!Sincerely,Retired KnitterPS - uhh ... don't drop that foot of snow this weekend ... I am going to the beach for a craft weekend with my cousin and friends. Any time after Monday will be just fine.PPS - no Internet connection where I am going - so I'll be back early next week - with pictures of my fun weekend - unless Mother Nature decides to be ornery."},
{"title": "Grandma is so ...", "date": "Tuesday, January 22, 2013", "text": "... Grand!!She adores us!  So a little introduction.From left to right, I am Meathead, the English BullDog.  I am the senior member of this family even though Grimace is a year older than me.  You see I was here first as a puppy.  Grimace was rescued at the age of 3 - so I have seniority.  I am 10 years old.  I am magnificent!Next in the center is Milo, the French Bull Dog.  He belongs to my Aunt Kris and he is 2 - a young, energetic, egotistic,  pushy, overly alert, and exceedingly cute dog.  The last quality saves his butt more times than you could imagine.  We remind him frequently when he is being a \"yo-yo brain\" (something that happens frequently), that his mom was shopping for a blond female French Bull Dog when she got him!  Blond!  Female! How she got side tracked by a brown male (even if he has melty bedroom eyes), we will never know!Lastly on the right is Grimace, the Pug, who is my adopted brother and a pretty good friend to everyone.  He is 11 years old.  But he loves Grandma with an intensity that would be considered stalking in the human world!   Anyway,  here are The liver cookies our Grandmother bakes for us every Christmas.  They are cut in the shapes of hearts and bones. And she doubles the quantity of liver listed in the recipe.  She knows her boys!!Shapes are very important. Likevery, very important!Making these cookies in simple circles is a bad idea.  When Grandma made these last year they were in circles.  They were cooling on the kitchen counter ... she was busy in the living room.  Then Grandpa came into the living room chewing and chewing away, asking ... \"These aren't chocolate chip cookies, are they!\":-)Since we don't like sharing our liver cookies, (and Grandpa doesn't like liver), the shapes save our treats for us.New followers ... Welcome to Grandma's blog. An introduction to Grandma can be found here.  Information on Grandma's first Give-Away (it isn't liver cookies), can be found here.Sincerely,Meathead"},
{"title": "Give Away Creation Begins", "date": "Monday, January 21, 2013", "text": "This posting is part of the Grow Your Blog Event.  Introduction to this event and to me can be found here.As part of the Grow Your Blog Event, I am holding a give away.  The details of how to participate can be found here, but in truth, it is simple.Leave a comment on any of my posts from January 18 up to mid-night on January 31 - and you are automatically entered.  No anonymous comments accepted.  Leave your blog or email address in the comment.Names will be put into a basket and one person will be selected to win this hand woven scarf. And now to give you the first update on the prize I am creating.The fun part of weaving comes after a lot of preparatory steps.  Here is a quick pictorial tour of how it is done.The yarn is prepped by making them into yarn balls.The warping yarn is threaded into the rigid heddle reed slots.As a novice weaver, I keep reference material handy to be sure I have the steps correct.Keep threading the yarn through the slots until the width you want is reached.The warp yarn is  barber pole style.Once all the slots are filled, the holes are threaded as well.Then the majority of the yarn is wound on to the back beamand the front ends are tied to the front beam.The weft or weaving yarn is wound onto a shuttle.The yarn in the holes and in the slots is separated by moving the reed up and down creating a shed or space to pass the shuttle through.The white yarn will be removed and discarded when the weaving is complete.It serves to even out the warp threads so they are more parallel.And then after a bit magic happens! :-)Ok, that was impossibly brief!  Bunches of steps were left out.  To technical to show it all.  Most of the readers would have clicked off the page is I showed everything.  But it does give you the flavor of the process and a peek at how the weaving material will look when completed.I like the way the colors are turning out.We will do another update in a week."},
{"title": "Grow Your Blog - Give Away", "date": "Sunday, January 20, 2013", "text": "For the very first time in 2 1/2 years, I am hosting a give away as part of my participation in the Grow Your Blog Event.If you are new here, my introductory post can be found at this link.  I shared a bit about who I am and why I blog.Here is the low-down on my Give Way!!Early in 2012 I took up weaving.  I have done a number of hand woven scarves.The beginning of my very first weaving project!Two completed scarves.My last scarf was woven to match my winter coat.So for my Give Away, I plan to weave a scarf using these two yarns. I will weave with variegated purple.  This yarn will be the more prominent color.   The other yarn will be the weft - and it has black, shades of purple and some hints of green in a barber pole look.And I plan to blog about the process periodically until January 31 when the scarf will be completed.  I'll show pictures as the project progresses.  How it turns out will be a surprise to all of us - after doing a number of scarves, it is amazing how weaving two yarns together creates an entirely different and sometimes unexpected look.More details about the width and the length will come in future posts - as I warp up the loom - but I tend to make long-ish scarves that are 10 to 12 inches in width.  I like a scarf that can wrap around my neck more than once.If you are interested in winning a hand woven scarf, it easy to be included:just leave a comment on my blog between January 18 and January 31 (comments made on the first post will be counted.)leave an email address or your blog site so I can reach you if you win.you don't need to be a follower, or even a participant in this event.you don't even need to have a blog but anonymous comments will not be included.the winner will be selected randomly - your name will be included in a basket and drawn on February 1st.It couldn't be easier.Thanks to all who have visited my blog so far, and a special thank you Vicki for hosting this event."},
{"title": "Hello!", "date": "Friday, January 18, 2013", "text": "I think I see a new face or two coming for a visit to my blog.My name is Elaine, and in some circles I am called Retired Knitter.I am participating in a Grow Your Blog event, sponsored by Vicki at 2 Bags Full.  This creative fiber artist decided it was time to say \"Thank You\" to the blogging community for all the support she has received over the years by helping bloggers to grow their readership. I love these events because I love to discover new blogs.Vicki suggested several elements for the event participants to follow.  Start with an introduction ...Who the heck are you! So here goes:I am a blogger.I am a knitter.I am a sometimes crocheter.I am a new-be weaver.I am a wanna-be spinner.I am a walker.I am a grandmother and dog sitter to three magnificent dogs (Meathead, an English Bulldog, Grimace, a Pug, and Milo, a French Bulldog).I am a wife of 43 years, and a mother to 2 grown children and 1 new daughter-in-law.I am a caregiver and daughter to my 86 year old mother.I am retired, and thank God for that because ...I am completely out of time or energy with the above stuff for anything like a real job.Before I begin the next segment (Why I blog), I plan to bore you for just a few minutes with pictures of my \"grandchildren.\"  I am a typical grandmother, after all.  So please stick around. Just pretend I have taken out my wallet, and I am sharing some family pictures with you.  And you, being a good blogging friend, can't back out gracefully ...  you smile,  show enthusiasm, and remark on how cute they are.Left is Grimace.  Yes, his tongue is sticking out.  It is one of his charming features.Right is Milo.  Yes, his ears are sticking up.  He is doing his \"deer imitation.\"This is Meathead. This is how he looks most of the time.Meathead is 10 years old and that is very old for an English Bulldog.I caption this picture as \"Sleeping dog with heavy lips.\"There!  That wasn't so bad.  I think we are going to get along just great.  :-)  Thank you for sticking with me this far.  Now we can move on to the next part of my participation.Answer the question ...Why do I blog!It started innocently enough.I discovered blogging through my friend, HappyOne, at Life is Good-Smile. I always felt better after visiting her blog.  The posts weren't exciting or unusual, just a chronicle of her daily walks and the activities that filled her days.  But reading her blog was like a short visit to a peaceful island where life was calm and orderly ... when my own life was anything but peaceful.  That was July 2010.The blogging seed was planted ... maybe I could have a blog too.  You see in July 2010, I was in my 3rd year as primary caregiver for my elderly mom.  She lived with me.  The intensity of her care had not reached a critical point in 2010, but it was growing in challenges and responsibility, and it was constant - 24/7.  In fact, I retired early from my job to care for her.  The story of my journey as an elder caregiver can be found on my blog under the label Through My Caregiver Eyes. I didn't start out wanting to write about my caregiving experiences ... I just wanted a way to express myself about fun stuff, life observations, my goals ... a distraction of sorts.  Caregiving was rapidly shrinking my world as I became more and more house bound with mom.  I wanted this blog to be about the life I wanted and to focus on stuff important to me.  I did not want to write about caregiving. It was important but private.A year of blogging passed!On August 15, 2011, I changed my mind and decided to write about my life with mom.  That year was terribly difficult.  Like the valve on a pressure cooker, I needed to let some of the steam out.  So I posted my first caregiving post on August 15th - and closed it to comments - private.  Just a place to sort out my conflicting emotions - because they were spilling out of the cracks in my life anyway. But bloggers are persistent people. I got a few private emails ... readers wanting to share their own experiences with me and to express a camaraderie.  It was surprisingly comforting.Then I received an email from Doris, a Nursing Home Social Worker, who blogs at Hold My Hand.  She wanted me to Guest Post on her blog - sharing two of my recent caregiving posts.  I remember the overwhelming emotions of that moment like it was yesterday.  One morning ... sitting at my kitchen table in my pajamas, facing my computer with a cup of coffee, struggling to read Doris' email through my tears. Someone saw and understood.  No judgement, no criticism.  And this nursing home professional thought I could do something good for someone else by sharing my story.  (The link to the Hold My Hand blog above, takes you to that post on my mom.) I agreed to the guest posting.And I put the comments back on my caregiver series of posts.Mom has now moved to Assisted Living. I am still her caregiver, but my primary role is now \"daughter\" ... as it should be.  I have taken back most of my life. And the experience of caregiving has changed me forever.My blog has evolved as well.  I share all sorts of things ... my entries are eclectic.  I have written about vacuum cleaners and tree bark, family life and all my dearly loved crafts, my grand dogs and my cats, my walking and my couch sitting (I won't lie, the walking habit is a struggle.)  I write about everything. And I still write about Mom on occasion.  But my life is now more balanced, more normal (well, except for writing about vacuum cleaners and tree bark - how normal is that?) :-)This blog was there for me when I really needed it ... as well as my blog friends ... during the most difficult months of my life.  It was a life line.  And unconsciously, I think I knew that at the time.Why do I blog?I now think you know!Hope you come back to visit again soon.  And I will be searching out your blogs, because the real joy of this kind of event for me is discovering new blogs.   FinallyOffer a contest!!Be sure to leave a comment - maybe introduce yourself if you are new here.  All commentors will be eligible for a prize if they include an email address - my first contest ever - more on that next time!Be sure to come back on Monday, January 21st to find out more.Like seriously!I can see it in your face.You know you want to come back!!!Cheers!Elaine   Retired Knitter,   Caregiver,   Daughter, and   BloggerPS - A final picture of my 3 grand dogs - sleeping! The most blessed of all times!! PPS - Ok, so it is not the final picture.  No sense in starting off our new relationship with a lie!!"},

Already the New Year looks very different.Over the holiday period my son and daughter-in-law moved temporarily into our home.  2013 is the year that they prepare their townhouse for sale, sell it, buy a new place closer to work and move again. But for the near future, my home has once again expanded to shelter family.  And this time the  \"family\" included my two grand dogs. In fact, as I sit here on my couch at 6:30 am typing away, my two dear boys are sacked out on either side of me snoring away.  That is their usual schedule on a work day: get up, walk with Papa, get fed by MoMo, and go back to sleep.  The only difference for them is that now they have a grandma nearby every single day to give them lovies and walks. Oh the difficult life they lead!!  :-)Of course, it helps that the dogs are here and won't be underfoot while their former home is spruced up for sale and shown.So the New Year is different with many changes expected in the future.I welcome it all.  I am enjoying every moment of it as I sit here on Day 2 of 2013. PS - I love having family under my roof.  I love the feeling of a filled house.  I know this situation is temporary.  All the family move-ins over the last 10 years have been temporary - as they should be.  But I have loved them all.  One day it will be our turn, and my husband and I will move into less space.  We won't have the luxury of opening our doors this way ... but for now, it is grand!"},

Here is a cartoon with another interpretation of the symbols.  I vote for this interpretation!Anyway, we had a great time.See you guys tomorrow!!  :-)"},

I enjoyed the process, the knitting and the thoughts of giving it as a gift.  The action of knitting it helped slow down time and remind me that this is what is important, this is how I can help, this is how I can put a smile on her face.And I didn't want to box it up.  I shopped for a basket that complimented the colors of the shawl.  And it was no easy task to find such a basket during the season when everything, and I mean everything is red or green.  :-)A gift from the heart ... during a time when we sometimes forget that gifts should come from the heart!"},

But the beauty of the fog provided a gentle and peaceful atmosphere.  A lovely personal space in a busy day.My thoughts focused on slowing of life, enjoying the moment, simplifying the frantic noise of too much in too little time.  My pace was more of a stroll.  I visited the water's edge frequently to listen to the silence. Somehow the time spent thinking seemed more important than how many steps I was taking or how quickly I made it around the lake.Life goes on.Then the inconceivable happened.  The violent slaughter of innocent children.  Newtown, Connecticut sounds like a quaint New England town where only good things happen.  A town that is a peaceful as the lake pictured above ... and yet this month, it was a horror - worse than any hurricane or earthquake. My thoughts were in a turmoil once again ... sorrow for the families and this town, and sorry for us as a society.  Somehow these children who lived hundreds of miles away from my town ... these children felt like our children, my children.  Words were useless.  Actions ineffective.  Disillusion that anything could change this now or in the future.And then I heard on TV that Newtown has been flooded with requests for a town address.  Citizens around the country were seeking a way to send personal messages to the members of this town, our town, to let them know of the sorrow that we all share with them. I am not sending Christmas cards this year, but I will be sending a note to this town, our town, so that they know - \"You are not alone.  We are in deep sorrow with you.  We are all citizens of Newtown this day.\"If you care to send condolences to our neighbors in Newtown, follow the link below to get more information.  The address is listed below.Peace my dear blog friends.  Slow down your time by not rushing the days.Don't fret about what doesn't get done.Love your family and your friends.Take time to enjoy the moments of your life.You never know how many moments you have left. LinkCondolences to Newtown ConnecticutPO Box 3700,Newtown, Connecticut 06470."},

But then there are the other new things that I have grown to LOVE!  Like ...The Reminder List app - I use it like a To-Do list for each day.  This little app works similar to a calendar.  I stack up my activities, I mark them off, they get moved to a completed list, undone stuff gets automatically moved to the next day.  No more writing down everything on a piece of paper and then misplacing the paper. (I can't tell you how often I did that.)Now I have GPS - I know.  I am probably the last person on the planet to get GPS, but now it is my new toy.  I have my son's address on this screen.  I know where he lives, but I play, I play.  Someday I might go somewhere where this would be handy.Let's not forget the apps.  My favorite app right now is PT Timer - it allows me to set the time sequence on my stretching exercises so that I don't have to count to the 60 second hold with each exercise.  It times me and tells me when to stop.  Love it.  I can watch TV or listen to a book while doing my stretches. What is nice is that this \"monster\" is the only piece of equipment I need to carry.   Before I had 3 things: iPod, cell phone, camera.  Now it is all in one. I can take pictures (great pictures), check email and surf the web without needing to be in a hotspot. I can see your expression!  \"Well, of course you can do these things.  Everyone can do these things.  Why aren't you keeping up?\"  *sigh*  I guess I am a slow adopter to technology. Why do I call this phone a monster? It is a monster because I started out not wanting it, but somewhere along the way I \"drank the cool aid\" and now I love it.  Not sure how that happened.

My main goal this year was to simplify.  I eliminated one big chunk of time by purchasing a pre-cooked Butterball turkey.  The instructions said to put the bird in the oven at 325 degrees for about 2 hours to heat.  The house filled with the wonderful aroma of turkey, there was no basting or constant temp checking for doneness.  And remarkably, it turned out PERFECT!!  Everyone one said it was one of the tastiest and juiciest we have had in years. Even my husband who doesn't typically enjoyed turkey, loved this one.  He even ate turkey as leftovers the second night.  (That was a first, I assure you!)I was shocked, of course, because for years our turkeys were always special purchases with special preparations.  Since I was taking this short cut, I really didn't hold out much hope that this turkey would measure up.  But I am a believer now.  And after all, shouldn't Butterball know how to cook a turkey perfectly!??!And it looked pretty darn good as well. Beautifully browned.  It weighed only 12 pounds but that size turned out perfect for us as well.Every last bit of that bird is now gone - either eaten in the last few days or frozen in many containers as turkey soup in my freezer.***** The only down side of all my holidays now is that mom cannot be with us.  Still ... those 20 steps that lead to my house are beyond her abilities.  So my son and I went and shared lunch with her on Thanksgiving at Assisted Living. The main meal served at noon was, of course, a turkey dinner. :-) I wish I could be casual about this whole thing and make excuses why she wouldn't enjoy the business of the holiday at my house ... but I can't.  Holidays for us traditionally are family times.  She is my dearest of family members, and she is not with us on these days.   Christmas will be another hard holiday for me that I just need to get passed because there is a sadness that I won't have her with us.  Oh yes, we will take her out to lunch on Christmas Eve and I will take her to Christmas Mass on Christmas Day.  But it is not the same. It is just not the same."},

{"title": "What Matters", "date": "Monday, November 5, 2012", "text": "Life has a way of stopping you dead in your tracks, pealing away the extraneous in an instant and focusing you on what really matters in life.I will be gone from my blog until next week to focus on what really matters.We had a serious scare with my dear dog, Meathead.  He is an older English Bulldog.  Thursday night my son called and said he needed help getting Meaty to the emergency vet.  Meaty was having trouble breathing. Within minutes I was out the door.  (My husband later said I didn't even hang up the phone.) Tests were inconclusive, but the x-ray showed something near his lung.  The vet recommended the specialists at another ER vet clinic 40 minutes away.  Meaty spent the night at the second ER.  After more tests and exams  - the firm diagnosis was still missing.  Pneumonia, tumor, lung torsion ... maybe, maybe ...  It came down to treating for Pneumonia.  If not Pneumonia, the only choice left was euthanasia.  Surgery in such an old bully is not a humane option.  Antibiotics were started.  My son, his wife and their dogs spent a long weekend at Grandma's while we waited to see if Meaty's breathing improved.  We showered Meaty with love, with treats, help up stairs, and our undivided attention.  If this was his last weekend at Grandma's, we had to make the most of it.  The outcome was this ...A guy and his dog.  Buds!More weekends at Grandma's are in the future.Struggling with the right choices for Meaty was difficult, especially when you aren't sure what the diagnosis is.  We are apparently treating a deep seeded pneumonia.  His breathing has improved greatly - almost totally normal. Antibiotics will be part of his regimen for at least 2 weeks, but maybe longer.  A repeat chest x-ray will be done in 2 weeks.  We are hoping for good news.  My son and his wife deserve the \"Dog Owners of the Year Award.\"  Such heart wrenching choices they struggled with this weekend.  Thankfully they made all the right ones.If that black cloud wasn't enough, my daughter-in-law's mother was hospitalized and is seriously ill.  She was in the ER with her mother while my son was in the Vet ER with his dog.  Now hours are spent at the hospital at her mother's side ... wading through all the issues and decisions that go with being a first line care giver.  My heart goes out to her as I have a sense of what she is dealing with.  We are all worried for the family.Just those two issues should have been enough bad karma for this couple.  But one of their friends was in an auto accident and very seriously injured.  He spent the week in Shock Trauma with a life changing injury.  He has a long road ahead to recovery.  This was shocking news for all of us.It was good to have everyone under the same roof to help juggle the many competing issues that kept falling on their heads.  Some of the bad has started to resolve, some of the bad has yet to begin the mending process.  Some things can't be fixed by simple antibiotics.But this week my focus will be family - what really matters. I'll post again sometime next week.PS - If you pray, please spare a few prayers for my son and daughter-in-law ... and for her family."},
{"title": "Epic Fail", "date": "Wednesday, October 31, 2012", "text": "So all my frantic ice making preparations for Hurricane Sandy were an epic fail for keeping the power on along the east coast.  You thought I was joking about that, but usually when I prepare for something, it doesn't happen.  To everyone in the path of Sandy ... sorry.  I did my best.We lost power for about 24 hours. That wasn't the only epic fail we experienced.  We lost our land line phone service. But, hey, I have a cell phone, right?  hmmm ... well sort of.I have this simple cell phone.  It cost $20 for the unit.  The service was the cheapest I could find - $20 every 3 months through Virgin Mobile.   Early days with this plan (2009) I used it so little I had accumulated about $90 is unused minutes.  I was and continue to be - a low user of cell phones.But ..Mom got sick a few times prior to 2011, and then she was sick pretty much all of 2011!  I used that $90 quick.Now why would I tell you this story?Well here is the real epic fail of my phone service.My house is a dead zone for my cell phone.  Ha!  No problem, since I have a land line in the house.The power goes out. No lights.My land lines go dead.  No phone.  No problem.  I can use my cell phone to report the outages.Oh, that is right.  I need to stand outside to make a call.Lest we forget there is a mega hurricane on the eastern seaboard.  No matter.  I stand on the side walk and make the call. (Thinking Rambo thoughts - Sandy doesn't scare me!)My land line phone company, AT&T, wants to do some \"problem solving maneuvers\" while I am on the line before they schedule a technician to visit the property. Maybe this can be fixed quickly. (Bets anyone if this will be quick or not?)Remember - if I go into the house with my cell phone to make \"the maneuvers,\" my call will be dropped!  Can't do that.Oh wait.  I am not alone! My husband can do the maneuvers, so I yell the phone company instructions to him from the sidewalk (where I am standing in the rain.)ahh ... it is very dark in the house.   We have 5 telephones on 3 floors.  He must stumble his way around the house using a flash light and his poor eye sight to do my bidding.  Wet. I am very wet.Oh, and before you say my husband should use the cell phone and I should disconnect the land line phones - you need to know he doesn't use cell phones.  It is a thing with him.  I must admit at that point standing in the rain, I thought he might be on to something!! :-)So the \"maneuvers\" didn't work.  We are still without land line service.  But we still have our trusty $20 cell phone - which is soon to be history.I think I will maneuver this little Virgin Mobile phone with its stinko network into the trash and get myself a \"big girl\" phone ...  I think an iPhone is looking pretty sweet right now!Two epic fails in 24 hours is quite enough for me."},
{"title": "Rhinebeck", "date": "Monday, October 29, 2012", "text": "Today makes me want to sit by a window and just watch the rain pour out of the sky.  Thankfully the rain is still only pouring straight down ... not side ways with great winds like expected this afternoon and evening.  It is funny how weather can make you feel energized or sedentary.  It is a sedentary day for me right now.But 8 days ago, the weather was perfect and I was walking around the NY fair grounds at Rhinebeck.  The Sheep and Wool festival was in full swing.It began with a bus ride.And not just any bus ride, but one where almost everyone was doing this ... so nice to be surrounded by my \"peoples.\"Of course, you know me now pretty well.  I had to do something a little different.Yes, that is me in the bus bathroom.  I did legitimately need to use it, but I also legitimately needed to take a picture.:-)Thank God that small area had hand rails all around!I think the bus driver must get his kicks by increasing thechallenge level of using the pot successfully.The fair grounds were spectacular.  No inadequate words from me are needed.And then, of course, the best of the best - a picture of me with my cousin.The bus trip was arranged by my cousin's yarn shop - Gosh Yarn It.  Cute and catchy title for a yarn shop I think.  They also have these very cute bags that I have been coveting for some time.  (I know coveting is a sin, but it isn't like I am coveting something sinful, like some one's husband.  Mine is a small covet.)  Here is a close of up the bag.The day ended with a return trip over the Hudson River.  Beautiful place to have your gy-normous summer mansion if that is your style.But here we are now 8 days later with this ...Actually rain is just fine with me.  I love rainy days (even Sandy-Rainy-Windy days) as much as I love sunny ones. Did I buy anything at the fair?  Gosh, yes.  Need you ask?  No yarn, though.  Hard to believe right?  Do you need a reminder picture of my yarn closet?Pictures on that to follow at some point.On a severely rainy, windy and generally stormy day like today (yet beautiful in its ferocity - Thank You Hurricane Sandy), it is pleasant to remember another beautiful and the fun filled weekend in Pennsylvania and New York - just 10 days previously.It all began with a wonderful drive up through Pennsylvania.  It took hours and hours, mostly because I made a few stops before my destination.  But I find that I enjoy driving long trips by myself.  It wasn't always the case.  But over time and with a few trips under my belt, I have discovered the joys of day traveling by car as a solo traveler.  Sort of like a private adventure - time for thought, time for audio books, less stress when I get lost - which I did a few times - it is all good.Maryland has hills.  Pennsylvania has mountains. Mountains that make your ears pop.Pennsylvania was also a few weeks ahead of us in the leaf colors.My cousins live on a large area of land on top of a mountain in Northern PA.  Their \"driveway\" is about 1/2 mile through the woods and up a rugged hill.  All wheel drive is pretty much a requirement. My cousins' drive way - looks beautiful and is beautiful.  It is also \"Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.\"I couldn't seem to capture a picture that would show the \"wild,\" just the \"beautiful.\"Looking down the hill beyond their entrance to \"Mr. Toad's Hill\" is the beautiful view .   The hill continues further down another 1/2 mile or so from this point.But the real challenge is looking up ... and up ... and up.And if you look closely, you can see one of the houses just between the trees.As you are nearing the house the road is bordered by a rock wall.A charming feature I have seen in other areas like Gettysburg.The hill is kind of a \"major event\" for me.  I decided on my first day to walk the one mile trip to the bottom.  Some areas were so steep that you had to be very careful with your footing.  Falling on the uneven rock bed was not on my agenda for the day.And as I was descending the very steep parts near the bottom, I gently reminded myself that I had 2 ways back up the hill.  I could walk back up, or I could call my cousin to drive down and pick me up. Yeah!  Right!  I wasn't calling my cousin!  No way.  I am an active healthy person and I can do this. And I would do it if I had to crawl on my hands and knees.And so I began the trip up with a positive attitude. After about 100 feet of walking (do not laugh), I stopped.  I checked my phone  (you know, to make sure it was working,) took a picture of the surrounding trees, breathed deeply, checked my pulse rate, retied my shoe laces, checked my pulse again, deep breaths - and decided I could continue.The road flattened for about 20 feet and then got remarkably steep again.Focus, focus, focus.You can do this!  Just keep breathing.Got to the next flat part and decided to recheck my shoes again!  :-)  Yep, shoes were still on my feet!  Breath, breath.  Yep, phone battery still charged.  Breath. Pulse pounding strongly in my ears so that is a good sign (right?).  A heart attack on this hill was not on my agenda for that day either.And so it went.  By the time I got half way up the hill, I got my sea legs for this little jaunt and was able to make it the rest of the way up without stopping.  I did, however, began to peal off clothing before I made it to the house.  I was still decent when I walked into my cousin's house, but the thought did occur to me that under pants and a bra were really all that was needed in 50 degree weather.  More clothing is just ostentatious.I spared my cousin that experience.  I love her and want to be invited back again.Later that day I learned there was a story to those steep and flat parts of the road.  Apparently my cousin's grandfather built that road a long time ago.  He build the flat parts so that he had a place to \"rest the horses.\" The man was a genius ... just say'en!Tomorrow .... (if I have electric - remember Sandy is being a witch outside) ... if I have power I will share my time at Rhinebeck.  Great fun."},

Maybe I should write something about that.Wouldn't it be a total hoot if Sandy did the \"female thing\" and changed her mind about where to set down on land?  Wouldn't everyone get a chuckle if she turned a hard right and headed right back to the African coast?Ok, so that probably won't happen.  But I have taken steps to ensure that electrical power stays on during the storm.Been making ice since Wednesday for the ice chest and for any empty spaces in my two freezers.  I ain't loosen any frozen food this time.  No sir!Been making various foods that can be eaten at room temperature.  We will not go hungry.

So just sit back and take in the glory of me and my new duds!So here I am showing off the colorful pattern and the details of my new coat.I especially like the generous strap that allows for expansion of girthshould that ever happen to me!Again, this is me ... showing off a bit of my wonderful physique!My hair is so sparse and short with no fat that I get cold - hence the jacket.From the top - really quite perfect for the cold weather.It goes all the way to my tail and hangs wonderfully down both sidesprotecting from the cold my ... ah .... well, you know what is there.Now all my Grandma needs to do is find something for my delicate ears!From what I hear of my Grandma's thoughts, she now must find something special for her other two granddogs - Meathead and Grimace.  She tries to keep things even in the \"giving\" department.  But coats for them would be almost cruel because they run to hot, hot, hot ... all the time hot. Note from Retired Knitter:A little background on the coat:  Good Shepherd Dog Coats is the company that makes these coats for dogs. \"Made in the same manner as our durable and warm lamb coats, which are relied upon by shepherds to keep their newborn lambs thriving and comfortable in winter, Good Shepherd Dog Coats will keep your dog equally warm and cozy in cold weather.\"I found this vendor at the Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival.  Because French Bulldogs do not run to standard sizes, I had to have this coat made specifically to Milo's measurements - which they are happy to do.If you are interested in this vendor, they can be found at www.goodshepherddogcoats.com.  Apparently they do make coats for lambs as well (www.goodshepherdlambcoats.com).No, I have not been paid to post this message - just sharing a wonderful dog coat option with those who might be interested."},

The focus of this magazine on simplifying your life generally. They had a great article called You Can't Organize Clutter.  I have read a lot on the clutter subject, but there were some new ideas for me ... like:You can’t organize clutter. It just doesn’t work. I don’t care how many plastic bins, crates, or boxes you have neatly stacked in your basement.When you try to organize your clutter, you are actually just hiding it.Pretty simple stuff, right?  But for some reason the idea that you can't organize clutter never occurred to me. And I totally agree with this statement.In my professional life I was a big believer in organization.  I thought there was no substitute for a well ordered professional life, organization made things easier in the end, and I was recognized time and time again for that quality. I am not so rigid in my personal life, but I do think that it helps things run more smoothly.  But the simple idea that organization isn't the answer to a clutter problem was a new thought for me.If you are interested in simplicity, or downsizing, or decluttering, or just trying to get control of your environment ... check out this free monthly online magazine."},

{"title": "Deep declutter", "date": "Monday, October 1, 2012", "text": "I just spent hours quickly looking through a life time of greeting cards that goes back about 50 years.  I feel drained.Sorting and discarding is part of my deep de-clutter process for this fall.   We have the greeting card collection my mother-in-law left behind (she died in 1997), and I have avoided taking action on this for a long time.She was a person of very moderate means.  Her apartment was her castle - it resembled a gift shop more than a home, but everything was perfectly arranged, orderly, clean, and loved.  And she loved greeting cards - she saved every one given to her.  Because they meant so much to her I was unwilling to discard them after she died.  But the downsizing process can be brutal - we haven't even gotten down to shedding the stuff we care about yet ...  much less holding on to the things that she cared about. Today I tackled that large box of cards.It has made me sad in unexpected ways.Discarding the box without opening it would have been the easier path.  I didn't do that.  I examined every card.  It was fun to see the progression of my husband's signature (and my childrens' signatures) as they matured.  Most cards did not have dates so there was no way to determine age except through the immaturity of the signature, and the classic look of the cards. I did find some cards that had notes in side - I kept those.   Most of her cards were from family.  There were, however, a few affectionate looking cards signed Steve, and then others signed \"J.\"  She was divorced from the time my husband was 7 or 8. There was nothing beyond the signature from Steve or \"J\" (and that was how it was signed - with quotes), but they are part of a life long gone and the details were known only to her.And so I kept a few with personal notes that reflected some history.  The others are gone.  Kind of sad. But I content myself with the thought that most of those cards were her memories - not ours.  I have kept a small sampling of her cards with respect for the history represented in some of them.Interestingly, I followed in her path as a newly wed in keeping greeting cards.  So, yes, I have a large number as well.   The review is ahead of me.  I'll will keep enough to remember, but most will be discarded as well.  Maybe 30 years from now my own children will be looking and deciding what to do with mom's greeting cards.My advice?  Chuck the cards - keep the photo albums!  (*sigh* another big project ahead - a good snowy day activity.)Do you save greeting cards?"},

{"title": "The Holiday Season - looming ahead", "date": "Wednesday, September 26, 2012", "text": "Warning!  If you are a big fan of the coming holiday season, you might want to skip this post.With the beauty of Fall and the magnificence of Winter (I hope ... ) comes another season that is separate from nature.The Holiday Season. (Already??? Didn't I put away those darn Christmas decorations just last week??)If you are anything like me your reaction to the Holiday Season is complex.  I feel I am facing down Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years all in the space of about 2 months!I know, I know ... it is only September.  I can hear your thoughts: aren't you rushing things a bit? Well, not really.  The stores are stocking Halloween paraphernalia now.  By October 1st  Thanksgiving and Christmas stuff will be all over the place.  In fact, they will start putting the Christmas stuff on mark-down by December 1. I have even seen a few references in blogs that I read about preparing for the holiday season.\"Bah! Humbug!\"  For the last 2 holiday seasons (2010 and 2011) ... what I really wanted to do was skip the whole thing.  But is that even possible living on planet earth! Isn't that sad?How did this happen to me?  I do enjoy the company of friends and family who are in a celebratory mood, but there is so much I feel I could skip.I don't think the \"Bah Humbug\" mood happened over night.  I think it has been growing steadily over the years.Thinking back to when my kids were young, I decorated for most holidays - Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas/New Years.  Christmas decorating was the BIGGY!  All my regular stuff got packed away to be replaced with green and red, and gold and silver STUFF!!  (There's that word again.)For about 10 years I have been backing down all the decorating.  I turned a real corner Christmas 2010.  That year mom was sick from Thanksgiving until Christmas.  There were no decorations, cards, wrapped gifts, parties, cookie baking ... nothing, until the day I brought her home - December 23rd!  The whole month of December I wanted to stop the clock so I could catch up.  But Christmas still came or the spirit of Christmas arrived on the day mom came home.Even Christmas 2011 was different.  Mom was newly placed in Assisted Living that December - I still felt time-constrained to do the traditional holiday prep.  New holiday traditions were forced to evolve.  And the spirit of the season still arrived - just looking different.I think in the spirit of my new \"pitch it, donate it, minimize it\" mood, I will prepare and participate in the Holiday Season this way:I will buy a precooked Thanksgiving turkey and limit the side dishes to just a few. (Maybe I will eventually evolve to celebrating with dinner out as some have suggested.)I will buy a Thanksgiving dessert - maybe cheese cake (I feel so bold picking cheese cake over apple pie.)I will drag those 8 boxes of Christmas decorations out and shrink them down to 3 or 4 (there used to be 15 boxes - big boxes - ostentatious!  To be fair I inherited a bunch of Christmas stuff from my Christmas-loving mother-in-law so that holiday clutter was enormous for a few years.)I'll decorate a tree, put a wreath on the door,  mount the candle lights in each window, and put a festive something on my kitchen table.  I will stop there. Christmas dinner will be much like Thanksgiving - easy!There will be gifts (I like that part - especially wrapping and giving), but I will skip sending cards (there are a few hours saved!)I will avoid the overly decorated Malls with the invasive holiday music.And I will get mom into the car one evening in December for a ride around to see local Christmas lights - she likes that.hmm ... seems like a lot of bullets!No matter.  I swear to you this list is WAY DOWN from 10 years ago ... scrooge-like by comparison.Maybe if I stick to only this ...

And what is the rest of the space doing?It is a close, cheap storage unit for stuff that is never used, or touched, or seen, or even remembered!!  We cool it in the summer and warming it in the winter and collect dust on it through all the seasons (dust that it heated and cooled as well.) I grow very weary of it all!Oh, don't get me wrong. I love my dear town house.  It is located in a lovely safe neighborhood.  It has housed growing children, adult children who bounced back briefly, and two mothers who needed help at end of life.  It has been the home for 7 of our cats over the 25+ years and a regular second home for my 3 grand dogs.  In the next year it will house my son and his wife for awhile as they spruce up their own town house, sell it and move closer to jobs.  This home has been a safe haven for more than just my husband and I.I have always said, \"Oh, we will be in this house another 10 years probably.\"  Now ... maybe a year or two.I will be sad to leave this house as it is filled with many great memories (and a few not so great) ... but I won't be sad to stop:cleaning 4 bedroomscleaning 3.5 bathroomscleaning all the other spacesclimbing steps, steps and more stepsheating and cooling 1000+ feet of living space we don't need filled with things we don't needI want to spend my time differently. I have also shifted my focus in other ways.  Over the last year I have discovered an unintentional mind shift away from these faulty ideas I nurtured for so many years:more is good (we had 6 functioning TVs - now we have 2 and we seldom watch those)newer is better (used is cheaper - saved $250 dollars on a used loom - \"used a few times\" kind of used.)expensive must mean quality (we used to have a $100 coffee maker - now we have the $30 one - they break at about the same speed)\"want\" must be \"need\" (I used to have a melon baller, had to have a melon baller ... seriously, who really needs a melon baller, I ask you.) pricey vacations are the only way to unwind (pricey vacations require pricey salaries with headachy strings attached - fewer headaches mean less need to escape.)Those are small changes in attitude that indicate big changes for me.  So like pealing away the layers of an onion, I am making changes and sorting through the stuff of a life time - in both my mind and my environment. And this time my de-cluttering is a sign of a root change in me."},

I believe we all age in our own way with some help or problems that genetics deals to us at birth.  Striving to age in your own way and overcoming road blocks is all up to you through your personal choices.Although my own aging goals look different from those of Rose, I choose to follow the spirit and the words of wisdom from Rose.Here is Rose's story ... (working on making my story look similar to this).***The first day of school our professor introduced himself and challenged us to get to know someone we didn't already know. I stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder.I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being..She said, 'Hi handsome. My name is Rose. I'm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?'I laughed and enthusiastically responded, 'Of course you may!' and she gave me a giant squeeze..'Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?' I asked.She jokingly replied, 'I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, and have a couple of kids...''No seriously,' I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to be taking on this challenge at her age.'I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting one!' she told me.After class we walked to the student union building and shared a chocolate milkshake.We became instant friends. Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk nonstop. I was always mesmerized listening to this 'time machine' as she shared her wisdom and experience with me..Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon and she easily made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attention bestowed upon her from the other students. She was living it up.At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet. I'll never forget what she taught us. She was introduced and stepped up to the podium.. As she began to deliver her prepared speech, she dropped her three by five cards on the floor.  Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into the microphone and simply said, 'I'm sorry I'm so jittery. I gave up beer for Lent and this whiskey is killing me! I'll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know.'As we laughed she cleared her throat and began,                                        'We do not stop playing because we are old;                                          we grow old because we stop playing.There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and achieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day. You've got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die.We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know it!There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up.If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one productive thing, you will turn twenty years old. If I am eighty-seven years old and stay in bed for a year and never do anything I will turn eighty-eight.Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding opportunity in change. Have no regrets.The elderly usually don't have regrets for what we did, but rather for things we did not do. The only people who fear death are those with regrets..'She concluded her speech by courageously singing 'The Rose.'She challenged each of us to study the lyrics and live them out in our daily lives. At the year's end Rose finished the college degree she had begun all those months ago.One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep.Over two thousand college students attended her funeral in tribute to the wonderful woman who taught by example that it's never too late to be all you can possibly be.***Excuse me now, while I go out for my walk!Cheers"},

Would these thoughts and images be too much for folks with a more forgiving heart than mine?  Would this be considered morbid or in bad taste?I chose horrific because the event was exactly that.  Anyone who witnessed that day cannot help but be changed by it.  My true feelings are filled with anger and rage at this terrible event even after so much time.  It serves no one to make this terrible day a memorialized memory.   I did not know anyone who was in those towers, but they were fellow citizens who were brutally murdered while going about their normal day.In searching for a photo I settled on a \"jumper\" picture.  How terrible it must have been to choose to jump rather than stay tethered to the building.And then I read an article that said these folks (at least 200 of them) didn't choose to jump.  The link to the full article can be found here.  But if you were upset by my one picture in this post, be aware that there are many more pictures of jumpers. The article did address my concern about if this discussion of jumpers was morbid or in bad taste.  Here is that section:***These are photos with a question that makes a lot of people angry. Reactions to it in the comments section are mixed; some feel that it is needed to \"never forget\", and to galvanize our resolve in the WOT. Others feel it's morbid and in bad taste.I think it all these things. Murdering people in terrorist acts is morbid and in the worst possible bad taste. I'd much rather think about other things. But ignoring and not dealing with things is precisely what led up to 9-11. If we can't even look at what's happened, how are we going to stop it from happening again? If we continue living in a 9-10 world, where we just refuse to look at or deal with some things, what will come next? If we can't look at the ugly truth, the whole of it, how are we going to respond to it effectively?***"},
{"title": "The Virtual Appalachian Trail Hike - Disappearing Trails?", "date": "Monday, September 10, 2012", "text": "I am making good progress in virtually walking the Appalachian Trail.  Since August 1 I have reached 200.7 miles which brings me to Mt. Collins, TN. Many of the pictures of the trails are beautiful - like this one, but I couldn't help be wonder - isn't there a chance that nature can reclaim the trail making it easy to lose one's way?  Doesn't this trail look like nature is trying to reclaim it.  There are white blazes on trees, but they aren't on every tree ... what if the trail \"disappears.\"Thoughts to ponder.I am reading the book Walking Home: A Woman's Pilgrimage on the Appalachian Trail by Kelly Winters.  It is very good, but almost all the trail books I have read about the Appalachian Trail have been really interesting.  I am beginning to think that it is the trial's story that is interesting rather than the individual experience.Ms. Winters makes a number of interesting observations during the book.  Here is one that never occurred to me.\"All of us know everyone who's hiking within 100 miles of us--even if we've never met--either through reading their entries in the shelter logs or from gossip passed on by word of mouth from others who have been seen or heard of them.  We have a community, a culture, and a fellowship that grows stronger as we all walk farther and endure more.  It's a long, thin community, spread out over 2,000 miles, but like Gypsies, we keep track of our tribe.\"It is this theme that permeates her story."},
{"title": "Zebra Butt", "date": "Saturday, September 8, 2012", "text": "So last weekend my daughter and I visited my son at his campground in Southern Maryland.  It is a two hour drive through very nice rural areas of Maryland.   On our way down we passed the most interesting farm called Flat Iron Farm.  Interesting because they have the most unusual array of animals in their fields.  Like the Clydesdale horse above.  Isn't he magnificent.And there were two zebras.  Zebras in Maryland, USA. Not an everyday sight.  This one wasn't interested in visitors. The grass was more appealing.BUT this one,  he was very interested in company.  Try to imagine (what really happened) ...  my daughter yelling at me as I leaned over the fence to get the picture to \"pull back, pull back\"  and \"MOM, PULL BACK.\"  (She is so protective of me.)  :-)  I pulled back.Gosh, if she hadn't been there I might have made friends with this beautiful creature.When I pulled back I got this great picture of his butt.   He lost interest in us really fast.  Oh well, how often to do you get see this such a great picture of a zebra's butt.And in the same enclosure with the two incredible zebras and the magnificent Clydesdale was this Lama - at least I think that is what he is.  He also was into showing off his butt.  He had no interest in us.  I think he knew I was a knitter and I am only interested in his fur.Anyway, it was a fun trip down, a fun time spent with family, and a fun trip on the return. Who would have thought we would see such diverse creatures all in one location.Monogamy and crochet - an unlikely pairing.Right now I am a monogamous crocheter.  Not because I love crocheting, or because I am super good at it.  I am monogamous to this technique so I finish a promised Lacy Cardi Wrap for my daughter.  Monogamy is the only way that will happen, I fear.I will say that this darn project tests my needlework resolve.  If you don't count the 4 times I ripped out my work and started over, and the 3 times I set it aside so I could complete knitting a sweater, and the 5 wash clothes I just HAD to make because my wash cloth stack was a little low, and the learning to weave (6 scarves, 2 table runners, and joining a weaving club) ... if you don't count all those things .... I am making great progress in crochet!!An early false start.I am, however, getting more skilled.  I don't need to use those jumbo eye glass magnifiers any more to see my work or aim an intense light on the stitches so I can see what the heck I am doing. Nope, when I crochet I can honestly say I look competent, comfortable, skilled, confident.  I can actually carry on a conversation while I crochet (talking mostly to myself, swearing, making faces, questioning my sanity, but heck, it is still a conversation!)  Just 6 weeks ago I could hardly breath and crochet at the same time.  Progress.Of course, there are a few sniggly little details I haven't shared.I still can't read that stupid crochet pattern worth a darn.  I have been told it is written poorly, so that is my story now. Not my fault. And I only know how to make 3 stitches because the body of the piece is just a repeat over and over again of 3 stitches.  There are some lacy parts coming up, but I'll panic when I get there. And counting all the way up to 5 seems to be a unexpected problem. The repeated stitch that forms the body of the project requires 5 stitch repeats. Just 5.  But sometimes I have 6.  Sometimes I have 4. *sigh*. I wonder if they will take back my college degree if I can't count to 5 consistently!!But ... on the up side ...I think I have gotten past the \"totally ignorant beyond measure\" stage as a new crocheter, and I am rapidly approaching \"absolute swearing-fool beginner\" stage!  Yeah!I am not giving up my knitting needles any time soon, my spinning wheel is really annoyed to be idle,  my empty loom keeps calling my name, and I am purchasing a larger loom in October because I am totally hooked on weaving, but this crochet thing just may be a possibility in the future - after I finish this first project.Like maybe this project for me!!  I aught to be able to count to 5 by then.My next crochet pattern?Current status on the wrap for my daughter.I think this crochet thing is growing on me.Maybe monogamy counts for something!"},

I wanted to see my kids pictures.  That was where they shared all their photos.  In 2010, I \"dropped out\" of Facebook for a time.  But I came back again.  I don't remember why.Now I am leaving Facebook for good.  Many reasons ...it eats up too much time - with no real satisfaction for meso much is just trivia about totally nothingwhat isn't trivia is lots of political posturing, religious expressions, and uncharitable opinions all of which I find irritatingcomments are sometimes rude or embarrassing (even when they aren't meant to beSometimes sharing on social media like Facebook is counter productive.So I am leaving Facebook behind for good.  This won't make a difference to anyone, so I won't be missed.And my kids pictures ... they send me an email attachment of anything they want me to see.Woke up today just plain tired - and for a change I slept really good.  What gives??I increased my walking in September.  Maybe I just need to take a rest day today.  Sometimes I wake up tired and then get a second wind.  Maybe when I get that second wind, I need to just use it for something else and let my body rest today.Looking back I can see I am making progress.May                         11,133 Average Steps (Partial Month - no real goals)June                         10,306 Average Steps (Goal 10,000)July                            9,849 Average Steps (Goal 10,500)August                     10,782 Average Steps (Goal 10,500)September (to date)  13,000+ Average Steps (Goal 10,750)White blazes on the Appalachian TrailSome of this progress is due to the mind games I like to use to keep me motivated.  Mind games are a useful tool in the walker's arsenal - especially when you are starting a walking program.  In August I started virtually walking the Appalachian Trail (walking north) on my blog.  And in September I started on the Appalachian Trail on Walker Tracker (walking south).  The Walker Tracker event is not a race, but I like to note my position with other participants.  I am in 4th out of 14 (as of this morning).  Some have not logged their steps for yesterday yet, so I am probably somewhere in the middle of the pack - which is my usual position in these events.  I like holding down the middle!!At this point I should meet myself on the trail coming from the south and coming from the north maybe in January 2013.  :-)Anyway the double incentives of walking the trail in both directions have caught up with me today and I think I will lay low.  If I were really on the Appalachian Trail, this would be a rest day spent in one of those 3-sided shelters.  I imagine it would be a rainy day spent waiting for the skies to clear sharing walking stories with other hikers who are also waiting out the weather.  A rest day.Walking the dogs this afternoon and evening will do for me.  I will share my \"walking stories\" with them.So how are you doing on the trail?"},
{"title": "Steps Update", "date": "Saturday, September 1, 2012", "text": "They looked like this ...And then this happened .....And now they look like  ....Cement! Damn.The Start. Typical Shelters.(Continuing series of my virtual trail hike.  Other posts found under the label The Virtual Appalachian Trail Hike)Total August milage: 149.5Springer Mountain, GA0 MilesSo here starts my journey.  The walking steps/miles in August have been applied to the Appalachian Trail.Sweet Water Gap, Mile 149.5Trail and CampsiteI think I did pretty good.I virtually reached Sweet Water Gap, North Caroline after my first 31 days of walking on this trail.I passed the Georgia-North Carolina border.  Nice they have a marker on the trail for that.North Caroline - Georgia Border, Mile 76.4The Appalachian Trail is approximately 2160 miles long.  Sometimes it is reported as 2150 miles and sometimes 2175 miles.  The distance changes because the trail is always under reconstruction somewhere and minor changes to the route are made.  The trail is cared for primarily by loving volunteers. A labor of love for sure.Usually hikers start in Springer Mountain, Ga, in the spring and travel north to Maine to finish in the fall.  Traveling from south to North gives you the best weather at both ends of the trail while walking but there are thruhikers who start in the north (during the chilly spring) and go South (to the hot summer and fall).  Regardless of the direction traveled, hikers can experience all weather types from extreme heat with humidity and freezing temps with sleet and snow.One of the biggest challenges from my perspective is where to sleep.  I am not big on sleeping in a tent. I have always said that \"camping out\" for me was staying a Days Inn, a simple and inexpensive hotel option found in most typical US states.Mile 2I would say these accommodations are a step down from Days Inn and a step up from pitching a tent.I am not into bugs or rodents, and you can find these creatures as regular residents in these structures.  Other casual \"residents/visitors\" could include snakes, skunks and bears.  Yes, bears.  Days Inn doesn't have those!Most of the shelters have only 3 sides.  Most have water somewhere near by.  \"Bathrooms\" can be found behind the nearest tree.  Sleeping in one of these is a shared experience - sleeping bags side by side like sardines in a can if the hikers are abundant.    You really get quite a sampling of humanity at these shelters and for some this might be a big negative.  You know, some of humanity isn't so great!  I guess this beats sleeping in a tent on the cold ground. And you have very little to pack up in the morning before moving on.***I have decided to track my progress against a mileage chart found at SummitPost.org.  If you are tracking your steps/miles and \"walking\" with me, you can find your own location against this chart and let me know how far along the trail you are. For those who are walkers using a pedometer, you might enjoy tracking your own progress on an actual map of the Appalachian Trail.  Walker Tracker is a free on line site that provides a place to log your steps each day.  There are many other features that make this a wonderful incentivizing tool, but the most appealing feature are the \"competitions\" that can be joined by just clicking the \"join\" button.  Then each day as you log your steps, the steps are applied to any competitions you have joined.  A \"little\" icon (that represents you) shows up on map with all the others in the competition and marks where each person is on the trail.  Very cool!I have started a competition called The Appalachian Trail on Walker Tracker.  It isn't really a competition - mostly an opportunity to track your progress on a trail map and see if you can finish the trail by May 1, 2013.  At Walker Tracker my name is \"esknitter\".  If you decide to participate there, look me up and \"friend\" me - friends are called \"comrades\" on Walker Tracker.  Be sure to tell me you are coming from my blog.I will post Appalachian Trail blog entries at a minimum of once a month - but I suspect I will drop in to report my progress a lot more frequently than that.Hope to see you on the trail!  But if not at Walker Tracker, at least here on my blog.Happy Trail Walking!"},
{"title": "Who are you ... really!", "date": "Thursday, August 30, 2012", "text": "So who are you .... really!I mean really, underneath,inside,where no one sees but you!The real you!It is the kind of question that some people find difficult.  They spend their lives being someone else because -they don't like who they really are,or they were formed by parents to be one way and find breaking those habits too hard,or they don't know who they are because they are so busy just \"fitting in.\"One blogger I follow, Chatty Crone, addressed that question in a recent posting called  Thursday Thoughts.  As I read her post I thought - wow, I could have written some of this!  I wonder how many people can relate to that feeling after reading her words ... or after reading my words.So I decided to answer that question about myself - because I am not the same person I used to be just a short time ago.  Please check out Chatty Crone's posting to see if it rings any bells for you.My first 60 years can be summed up in one word: conform.  Raised in the 50's (a conforming period) and the 60's (a non conforming period), it was a confusing and changing time.  But by the 60s, I strove to fit in and to not challenge. Some of it was in deference to my mom and the dysfunctional family we lived in.  I wasn't into causing her any more headaches.  Some of it was because I am (was?) an easy going person.  I was also raised within a religious tradition that was big into conforming.  If you didn't conform, if you questioned, there was guilt.Self esteem, independent thinking, trusting your instincts, questioning, self direction ... were not ideas that held any meaning for me growing up.  I grew into adult hood, selected my professional path from the narrow range available to women at the time (secretarial, nursing or teaching) and married the weekend after my college graduation.  I followed the path that was expected of me.It wasn't all bad.  Luckily my selection of a husband was good.  We are in our 43rd year of marriage and we have 2 wonderful kids.  I wouldn't change any of that.  But so many other decisions over the years were tempered and limited by my learned response to conform. When I look back on that point in my life, I despair at my lack of vision and independence.When I was 60 the transition began.  Mom moved into my home when I was 59.  The years between 60 and 64 were increasingly difficult years:  growing care giving responsibilities, constantly increasing demands, changing roles, and, at times, unsupportive and challenging attitudes from unexpected places.Those years changed me.  It was like a baptism by fire. I learned to speak my mind, to question authority, to take definitive action, and most importantly, listen to my gut rather than the opposing chatter around me!  I learned to set aside previously important relationships.  I learned to put myself first, finally.  I learned to question even the most basic truths of my religious upbringing without guilt.   I am not saying any of this is easy.  Sixty years of habits are hard to overcome.  But the change is now solidly established within me.  There is a different me!For my mom, I still do the same things she has always expected.  For her and her alone, I can set this \"new me\" aside as it would only cause her stress ... old age is hard enough without expecting her to adjust to a \"different\" daughter.And so Chatty Crone opened a flood of realization.  I wonder if my care giving years had never happened, would I still be cruising through my life living the expectations of others and seeking to conform. Just like the zebra in the picture above, I look the same on the outside, but on the inside - I am facing in a very different direction. Note:  I think my butt is smaller than the zebra's.  At least I hope so.  :-) (Gosh, is that a cultural conformity that I need to shed?  Most certainly!)"},

Not only is it pumpkin-colored and found in the fall, but it also glows in the dark. Fresh specimens sometimes give off a faint greenish glow at night or in a darkened room.These common mushrooms have caused many poisonings because they look, smell and even taste good. They cause mild to severe stomach upset but are not life-threatening to healthy adults.Jack-o'-lanterns have a pleasant, fruity fragrance. They are sometimes mistaken for the edible chanterelle, which is the same color and also has a pleasant smell. Chanterelles, however, have flat-edged, interconnecting ridges or wrinkles instead of knife-like gills and grow on the ground. Size: 3 to 10 inches tall, cap 3 to 8 inches diameter.These mushrooms are found in summer and fall, in large clusters at the base of trees, on stumps or on buried wood.*****The only difference is that these were not growing at a base of a tree - they did appear to be just growing on the ground.  Maybe there was some buried wood I didn't see.

I know ... that sounds like sort of a mid-life crisis reaction ... something you do because you fear advancing age and you gotta squeeze in just one more thing ... hoping to slow down the march of time.  Some people buy a red sports car, some have an extra marital affairs, some take up running, some live in house boat and sail off to see the world.Me? ... I would have loved to walk the Appalachian Trail.  Well, I am past my mid-life now at 65.  But the AT hike idea did pop into my head around 50.  And although my husband and I discovered light hiking late in life (our 50's), our later years have been filled with family responsibilities for me and increasing visual impairment for him.  So even light hiking now is out unless you considered the walk from the kitchen to the living room a \"light hike\".  We weren't campers, or hikers, or outdoors enthusiasts earlier in life.  The preparation for so strenuous an adventure wasn't there. But it doesn't stop me from reading about people who have taken long hikes.  Currently I am reading Walking Home, A Woman's Pilgrimage on the Appalachian Trail by Kelly Winters (publication 2001).Does she look 65 years old to you?hmmMaybe in my next life.It is one of many books I have read about people who have thru-hiked this 2160 mile trail on the eastern coast of the US.  I recommend it if you enjoy arm chair travel books that share an adventure you probably would never take.  I think it is out of print, but my library had it. Then I got to thinking.  I can't actually walk the AT trail, but wouldn't it be fun to virtually walk it.  This trail has a long shared documented history with many pictures.  Wouldn't it be fun to periodically apply my milage to the Appalachian Trail (AT) map and see where I wind up each time.  What are the sights I passed and the typical challenges of that trail, what can I expect going forward, and how long would it take for me to virtually walk the entire distance?  Yes, I am not making sterling progress on my current 1,000 miles a year goal - although I am picking up steam (and distance - with more on that later).  But, heck, it is a virtual walk and I am actually walking the steps anyway so why not see how they play out on the AT map.This new posting series will be called The Virtual Appalachian Trail Hike.  And I will do my first post at the beginning of September.  It will give me time to get organized.  I will apply my total August mileage to the AT and report on what I passed with pictures.  (I will try to avoid waxing on about my virtual blisters!) I am also looking for an online map of the AT that will allow me to post a little marker on it - sort of a visual that shows where I virtually am.  I haven't found anything yet.I would welcome company - either with comments on my \"adventures\" or with reports on your own progress should you care to join me in this walk.  Hey, come on!  2160 miles sounds like a big number, but ... really ... it is just a walk in the woods!Oh, you should also check out A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson! (My review here.) It is my favorite book of all time!  It is the story of the author walking the trail.  He is so unprepared at first that he makes me look like an AT veteran!  Great fun.Cheers!"},

It is easy to get distracted by breaks in exercise, times when the pattern of activity gets interrupted by life in general.  It is then when the temptation to take the easy road (the couch) is the strongest.For me - I have really only one goal - my big picture:  age well, age comfortably, age with enough energy and flexibility to do what I want for a long time.Aging well - guess that means different things to different people.  So often in our culture aging well means: keeping up with the younger generation, wearing a size 4 or 6 pair a jeans, using the advances in medicine to \"correct\" the signs of a aging, applying more make up to look younger.  Sometimes those things just point out your increased age - not how \"young\" you are.I wish our culture wasn't so shallow in their judgements of its older citizens.Well, I can't change that.  But I can march to my own drum. All the really \"young at heart\" people I know are active.  They are moving.  And they are interesting people who have active minds and bodies.  They are interested in living, thinking, creating. I believe aging gracefully includes respect for the limitations of the aging body (that isn't supposed to live forever), and making the most of what body and mind are left to you at any given time of life.  It is accepting the limitations that nature has hard wired into you at birth while using the rest as best you can.For me - walking is the key to the \"big picture.\""},

I did spend some time just laying on the couch!So the fact I made over 12,000 steps today is a miracle!Tonight?  A \"benedryl and Advil cocktail\" to ensure good sleep.  Tomorrow?  A morning walk!

It is red.  I couldn't find lighting that would show the colors correctly.I am also making some dish cloths.  I love knitted dish cloths. They do a fabulous job as cleaner-uppers in the kitchen and they are mindless, fun and quick to make.  Instant gratification.  Well, instant as in a day or two as opposed to 11 months for a sweater!!I will also get back very soon to a crochet wrap I started for my daughter.  Another project that I want done for this winter!!"},

Sometimes my efforts center on one room - like the kitchen.  Not this day. My one extravagance in life is my yarn and fiber crafts.  Tools, yarn, fiber, equipment, patterns, books ...  it has taken over one whole room so you know it is serious.  I like this room to look organized.  I live with the impression (not the reality) that I can find what I need in that room because I just reorganized it this spring. The room is small, only 8'x10', so if I need something, it most certainly can be found.Yesterday that impression was tested.  I tried to find a knitting pattern.  One pattern.  It was probably 5 sheets of paper clipped together.  No luck.  Ridiculous!  I was just using it.  It is right in this one little space - a small book case - in this small room.  No luck.This book case has about 40 books and five binders - filled with patterns I have clipped over the years - all categorized for ease of use.  But still. No pattern. On top of this book case was a stack about 18 inches high of patterns I had yet to file away.  Eighteen inches is a lot of patterns.  I looked through the stack.  No pattern. Then the thought hit.  Even if I lived another 25 years, I wouldn't knit all the patterns in that stack or in the binders.  Time to thin this space out.I went through every single pattern.  My God!  What ever was I thinking.  Some of those patterns were butt ugly.  Some patterns would look good if I was a size 2. (Not!)  Really ... that pattern has no shape.  Holy Moly!  I would go crazy with boredom knitting that pattern!   And so it went.Four hours and a huge bag of paper recycling later, the patterns were thinned out and all were filed.  And the one pattern that I wanted still wasn't found. I guess it truly wasn't there. You know, I feel so much better.But I can feel the Evil Clutter Fairy rising from the dead again! Looking around!  Yep, time to clean out another spot!"},

I love my loom.  I am eager to weave and to warp up new projects.  I am still a rookie, but I know this hobby has now put its stamp on me!  I am many scarves into this craft.  I am now working on a table runner (pictured here).  It is turning out problematically but I am learning from it.I am haunting web sites looking for another Harp - this time 32\" wide - so that I can make a broader range of projects.  I will get the stand that hold the loom because 32\" wide is to big a loom to brace against a table. And I joined a weaving club.  Spunky Eclectic Weaving Club.  A club project is sent to you every other month.  Each time the project and the skills used are different.  It will is a good way to expand my skill level with this new craft.Like a bug bite that needs to be scratched ...

{"title": "Talk the Walk - Mind Games", "date": "Sunday, July 29, 2012", "text": "Other than a good pair of walking shoes, you don't need much to walk.That is why I like it.I step out my door and I am walking.So why are mind games important.  After a time the mind gets bored (mine does) and starts working against you, trying to engage you in other things so that it is happier.  The mind has good intentions but it doesn't benefit your body.The most obvious method that works for most people is reading about walking.  I won't suggest reading materials here but they abound.  Just do an Amazon or Library search on the words \"walking exercise\" and you'll have your pick!One of my favorite games is my pedometer.  Currently I am using the Striiv Pedometer, and I have blogged about it here.  But generally any step counter will work if you are new to the idea of \"counting your steps.\"It is simple.  The more steps you take, the more you have moved.  Yes, getting your heart rate up for a specific period of time increases the health benefits, but it all starts with moving.  You can't lie about how much you have moved if your step count for the day is around 2,000 steps instead of 10,000 steps (the recommended number of steps needed each day for good health.)  And if you think 10,000 steps a day is enormous, look to the Amish.  Pedometer studies have shown that the Amish take an average of 18,000 a day.  An average!!For me: I am trying to do 10,500 steps in July.  I won't make it.  I had too many days below 10,000 earlier in the month, but August is another month and I will make it then.  And then I will move the bar - September might be 10,750 steps.  The goal is to keep moving and keep increasing.  The pedometer keeps me honest.  And my brain likes to beat my last step number.Another brain game I particularly like is Walker Tracker - a free online site where you can log your steps each day.  Walker Tracker is almost like a Facebook for walkers.  You can do the minimum which is log your steps each day - and see trends and stats from that simple action alone.  You can also bump up your participation by blogging some on the site, or making friends called \"comrades\" (I am esknitter there), you can get information about walking in the discussion groups, you can see ratings for pedometers, you can join like-minded groups on that site (Walking Women of 60, Audiobook Listeners, Weight Loss, Walking Knitters, etc. all with the option of sharing information).  But the reason I am on this site is for the \"competitions.\"  The map below shows a graphic representation of a competition - walking the Oregon Trail.  If you join the competition, your little avatar shows up on a map letting you know where you are in the walk and how far to the finish, what your rank is, etc.  Great fun.  There are no prizes for winning, just the satisfaction of participating.  Check out Walker Tracker if it sounds like something you would enjoy.  Look up esknitter - and make me your comrade!Writing about walking on my blog (yes, doing what I am doing right now), helps me.  I love taking pictures on my walk. The paths I take are pretty much the same each day, but the pictures I capture are the snapshot in time of something I saw.  I enjoy reading blogs that do this as well - like Life is Good-Smile, my dear blogging friend Happy One, who walks 6 + miles each day in all kinds of weather.  Happy One has been doing this for over 25 years.  She has risen to a new level - she walk for the joy of walking - I hope to be there someday. Volks Marching has recently caught my attention. I don't know enough about it to say much now, but I will share what I find out at some point.  It is a new mind game for me.  And finding new minds games is as important as participating in old ones.  Remember, the mind gets bored!Audio books are a regular part of my life - especially while walking.  I couldn't read as many books as I can listen to.  There are so many great reads out there and they are often enhanced by a talented reader. So those are my current mind games - and I am always looking for more.  Share what works for you."},

Of course, a little part of me is sad that she cannot be home with me.  Sad that she cannot pick up the threads of the life she had before all the loss.  That same little part worries that she doesn't ask any more about going home because she has given up.  And it is just part of a long list of things I have sadly watched her give up over the last 5 years. I know that she doesn't feel this sadness.  It is my sadness at experiencing all her loss.  Now her life settles around a very few things.  Visits from her family and weekly Mass on Sunday.  I can do that for you mom.You don't need to give up those things as well."},

{"title": "Talk the Walk - My History", "date": "Friday, June 22, 2012", "text": "I thought this picture was representative of what I am trying to do.Bring back some of the person that I was before.Connect the dots with walking.When starting any new endeavor, talking it out can be helpful ... even if you are just talking to yourself.  So in this semi-regular blog post, I am going to pretend I am talking to myself - about me and walking.  I am happy to share this \"talking to myself\" with you.Walking for me has been an on-again, off-again habit.  I started running back in my 30's.  I was younger and all my body parts cooperated without complaint (looking back I am amazed how little I appreciated that then.)  I was a hobby runner.  I ran about 2 miles several times a week.On those runs I discovered a few things about me and exercise.I feel better within a week.  It happens just that fast.I improve in time and speed quickly.I sleep better.I am happier.I love the natural rhythm of running.Also in my 30's I discovered that:Regardless of all the positives exercise gave me, I always stopped.  Always.In my 30s, however, the benefits weren't so in-your-face important.  After all, I was 33, 35, 37 ... and I didn't need to do anything to feel better or look better or be normal.  I wasn't disintegrating before my very eyes.  I was going to live forever - every 30 year old knows that!!  So why work up a sweat if the person I see in the mirror is just fine!! (The logic of 30 year olds!)So I stopped.In my 40s, the person in the mirror was less sure about living forever.  I tried running again. Mistake!  My knees popped, my lower back spasmed, and my plantar faciitus (foot/heel pain) began ... all were a constant reminder that pounding the cement was probably not a good idea for me.  But still I tried, because I was never very good at listening to my body. After a few falls and injuries that benched me,  I stopped running, but tried walking.I know, I know.  There are ways of working into a running routine safely, but that didn't happen. (The logic of 40 year olds is ... I am still 30. I don't need to do anything special.  I am still \"young.\")So walking it was, and walking gave me all the same positive benefits. But still, I stopped.  In my 50s the reality of the physical decline was hard to ignore. And now I knew I wasn't going to live forever.  But I still had another 100 good years ahead of me.  I also saw more of my future watching my mom struggle with the aging process that was complicated by her inactivity.  So I \"fixed\" my feet with prescription orthopedics, bought expensive walking shoes,  and put time aside to walk regularly.And guess what happened ... (all together now), \"She stopped.\"Now I am in my 60's.  The road ahead doesn't look any rosier that it did 10 years ago. Regardless, I tried to keep walking, but it was an off-again, on-again kind of thing!  All the benefits I know by heart, all the consequences of non-movement clearly understood ... all the excuses have been used up.So I am walking the roads again.Next time:  Talk the Walk - Mind Games"},

That is a pretty large jump in cost.So ...I guess this memory storage thingy on Blogger is the only game in town.  I guess when your storage runs out you have no choice but to buy more or you can stop posting pictures. :-(At first I was upset, but after I thought it out, I decided that $30 a year wouldn't break me, and it is a small price to pay for the enjoyment I get out blogging.But a number of questions come to mind.  I would really like to hear from you.Do you know how much free space you have on Piscasa?How can you find the percentage of expended Piscasa storage using the new editor - which will soon be the only editor?Are you already paying for memory space?  Are you paying the new rate or were you lucky enough to get the cheaper one?When you ran out of free Piscasa how did you know? Is there a \"work around\" to using Piscasa and avoiding this whole thing? What happens if in 3 years you decide not to pay ... do your currently stored pictures disappear from your blog? Is there another Piscasa option that provides less memory?  It took me 2 years to use up 1 GB.  The new plan provides 25 GB.  I don't need that much memory.Questions, questions, questions ...."},

{"title": "Retired Knitter knits, hooks, blocks, rips, ... stabs", "date": "Friday, June 8, 2012", "text": "So someone graciously asked about my knitting in a previous comment.You know, it only takes one inquiry from an interested reader ... and the rest of you who are not interested in knitting must sit through a knitting post.  :-)  I try to play fair to the majority interest when selecting blog topics, but just one of you needs to ask about knitting ... and the majority be damned!!(In truth, I was planning a knitting post.)  BUT in response to the HUGE outcry from my readership demanding knitting news ... here it is!!:-)I have been knitting .... but for some darn reason it has been going slow.  I started the Cassidy Hoodie sweater last October.  It should look like this by now. The Cassidy Hoodie by Chic KnitsIt doesn't.  Not yet. I did, however, FINALLY,  get the completed pieces onto a blocking board.  This task took me 2 long arduous hours!! My Cassidy on the blocking board.For the non knitters out there (if you are still reading, and you better be - this is important stuff), sometimes wet wool becomes like clay.  Blocking is best done when the wool is wet and toweled dry.  But wet wool has its own challenges.The sleeve cable. My wet sleeves stretched and became gorilla arms ... causing me some angst!  But I massaged those offending limbs into proper shape and hopefully the yarn now knows who is boss.  The test will come when I unpin the dry sleeves.  If gorilla arms reappear, I will take out a sharp instrument and stab them repeatedly.http://www.squidoo.com(Oh my, did I say that out loud?)Now you might be thinking .... wow, almost done with that project!  No.  Not really. I need to sew the seams, then I need to knit a generous hood off the neck, and then I need to knit a button band.  And then, I get to sew on some buttons. THEN, when I have done all that, THEN it will be done.  It will then be a sweater (or it will be a vest if the sleeves died an ugly death.)My second project (I bet you non knitters thought I was done - in your dreams!!), is a Lace Cardi Crochet Wrap for my daughter.  I started it in January.  It should look like this.It doesn't.  It looks likes this.Well, it did look like that just 24 hours ago, but being a novice crocheter, I messed up the sizing and the gauge.  I thought it was too small.  And the crochet stitch was too dense.  I wanted a lacier look - like in the picture above.  I also wanted to be able to crochet without having to use large magnifying eye glasses that ruin my eye sight and a special light that says \"gosh you have old eyes!\" every time I use it.I sure hated to rip this, but I did.Last night I started the project again with a bigger crochet hook.  Actually I started it twice last night (don't ask.)If you count all my \"start overs\" with this project, I am probably up to around 10.  If you count all the crochet stitches I have done for this project, I have probably crocheted the whole of this project twice!!!So now it looks like this.Hard to know if I will be starting over again until I have done a few inches.  (I must let it be known that using a large sharp instrument on this project is not out of the question either!!)So that is my knitting update.On more positive news ...Tomorrow I am going to an all day \"Spin In\" with family and friends at the Mannings in East Berlin Pennsylvania.    But more about that next week ... if the masses (meaning even just one person) demand that I blog about it (hint, hint ...), I most certainly will.:-)Till then!"},

{"title": "\"Writer\" or \"writer\" ... that is the question", "date": "Tuesday, June 5, 2012", "text": "Recently my blogging friend at The Feathered Nest posted a piece on \"writing prompts.\"  She described it as a rant.  Apparently there has been some discussion in blog land on this topic.  The point of contention is ... do \"real\" writers need prompts? Her rant generated a bunch of comments from her readers.Her post on this subject initiated another topic for me ...What makes a person a Writer (or a \"real\" writer)? In my opinion we are talking about 2 different things -  Writers and writers or someone who seeks writing as a profession vs someone who uses writing as a tool to do something else.For me a Writer is one who ...professes to practice a craftuses prompts to spark new writing ideasdeclares they MUST write to be happydesires to be published or achieve some kind recognition for their effortswrites about writingreads about writingseeks to improve their writing skillputs the word 'Author' after their name or in the title of their blogI am none of these things.(Now if you substituted the word \"Knitter\" for \"Writer\" - that would fit me more.) Blog land is filled with Writers or want-to-be Writers by my definition.  Usually I avoid these blogs because they are so focus on the writing process - character creation, plot structure, agent representation, their current writing project, or their next writing project.  Seriously, we do not share similar interests.I am a Blogger ... I use writing as a tool to blog.  I guess you could argue that if I write (even for a blog) that I am a Writer.  But I would argue the following: I cook but I am most certainly not a chef.My blog is more like the artist who uses a sketch book as chronicle of expression and paints for their own enjoyment.  They have no desire to become an \"Artist\" like Van Gough or Picasso.My blog is more like a game of golf with friends. I have no desire to be Tiger Woods.So ...Are you a Writer or a writer?  Do you distinguish between those 2 words?  Do you see any difference?It's ok.You can tell me if I am splitting hairs.:-)Retired Knitter, a Knitter:-)"},
{"title": "Move My Feet Campaign - Update", "date": "Monday, June 4, 2012", "text": "Photo by gelfayr.deviantart.comSince reviewing my new Striiv Pedometer and starting the Move My Feet Campaign - I've confirmed a few things about my \"walking-self\" since I started this campaign.I don't do mornings!How I wish I was a morning walker!  My friend Happy One at the Life is Good Blog walks every morning right after she gets up.  It is cooler and quieter, the sun rises are beautiful, and distractions are minimal.  But my body isn't cooperative in the morning.  It needs time to oil up all its parts with coffee.  And my mind isn't firing on all cylinders until after caffeine and food!  Finding my way home might be hard if I skip the caffeine and food step.  Afternoons and early evenings are my \"get moving time\".My body is schizoid about moving!The conversation goes something like this:Body:  This couch feels good.  There's knitting, reading, TV, lap top, and my grand-dog here.Mind:  Your Striiv step number is low.  Get up and move. Body:  But, my eyes are a bit heavy, so just a short rest before  ....Mind:  No!! It is 11:00 am after a full night's rest. Get walking.Body:  But I this joint has been ....Mind:  Up!! Up!!  You will feel better moving that joint.  Do not embarrass me.Body:  But, but ...About 2 minutes into the walk ....Body:  Hey, this feels good.Mind:  Of course it does. Hey ... Watch the cars!Body:  No, really, I could walk for an hour - no problem.Mind:  I told you so.  Now stop for a moment and start a Striiv Competition.Body: Heck, no. I don't want to stop.  I can do two things at once. No problem.(legs keep walking)Mind:  No, you can't.  Stop for just a moment.  You are missing out on energy credits for your game!!Body:  Really, I can multi-task. Just let me get the pedometer ... out ... of ... my ....(hand gropes in pocket for the pedometer)Mind: HOLY CRAP!  Look out!  Watch the curb!  Yikes!! Car on your left! Stop!  Stop!Body:  No, No.  I can do this.  Besides, that guy in the car has brakes.  He can use them!! (twitchy finger contemplates an ugly gesture at the driver)Mind:  But, but ...And so on!  The voices in my head keep me pretty occupied most of the day!  :-)10,000 stepsMy goal: 10,000 steps daily.  But I changed it to an average of 10,000 steps a day.  Many days I make the 10,000 mark with little effort - count in an hour of walking, 2 or 3 dog walks, plus my normal steps and shopping steps.  But the Striiv Competitions can easily push me up to around 13,000 steps on some days.  I love those competitions.On other days I spend hours in the car or sitting at doctor appointments or mom visits - and getting to 9,000 steps is an effort.So making the goal an average of 10,000 steps a day makes more sense.Right now my average is running in the 8,800s.  But it creeps up every day.I have more energy.It has only been a few weeks but I can tell I have more energy.  It is amazing to me that you get more energy when you expend energy.  Yes, in the evenings I am tired, but that is good - I am sleeping better as well. I love my Striiv.My Land, the Striiv game on the pedometer, doesn't look as good as this yet, but it will. It all depends on me to make it so with movement.  But I'll get there because I love this little Striiv pedometer.ConclusionSo all in all, I think I have made a successful start to walking regularly.  The real challenge seems to be:to keep focused, to not get thrown off by life's distractions, andto keep the voices in my head to a low roar!  :-)"},

We now buy the cheapest and simplest drip coffee maker we can find.  They all last about the same and the coffee quality is more impacted by the beans and the grind than the brewer.This week it was time once again to buy a new coffee maker, because our old one failed.  But the \"fail\" was extraordinary and totally unexplainable.The old coffee maker was creating too much coffee.  Yes,  too much coffee. I would fill the water well to the 12 cup mark, and the brewer would make as much as 14 cups, spilling coffee over the top of the carafe, all over the counter and onto the floor.  Now this didn't happen every time, but often enough for you to forget to watch the pot to avert the disaster.I know what you are thinking ... it must be holding water from previous brewings somewhere in the mechanism and at some unpredictable point it would use up all that extra water.  But no!Our 12 cup carafe never showed up short of coffee at any previous point.   Setting aside the fact that the coffee maker was small and had no physical space big enough to hold 2 extra large size mugs of water - there is no way to make 14 cups of coffee from 12 cups of water.The pot had to go.

Maybe we should reflect and thank our military a little more frequently than one day a year!So here goes ...I love the United States of America.I believe this country has done more good in our world than bad.I believe the ideals we were built on still vibrantly live within our boundaries and inside our citizens.Our people are inherently different because of our national ideals and young history. (Note:  not better people, just different)I respect and support our citizen soldiers who set aside their personal lives to protect and serve.And I strongly believe in defending all of that!I wish there was a way to compromise those thoughts with these.So many precious lives were lost fighting the wrong battles.So many young lives changed forever by battle injuries both physical and mental.National and international leadership replaced by political posturing and misguided egos.A tarnishing a national reputation for personal agendas.As a child of the Vietnam era, I fear the power of our nation used irresponsibly.  By the standards of Europe or China, we are a very young nation ... a \"teenager\" by nation building standards.  But how scary for all ... to find this \"leader of the free world\" to be a virtual teenager.Matt and I at his \"send off\" to Boot Camp PartyMy family has been little touched by war.  All my family survived WWII without damage and have participated in no other conflicts since then.  The cake at his party\"Good Luck Matt in the USMC\"My son served in the Marines for 4 years during more peace-able times.  I struggled greatly then with his choice to serve in the military.  I wanted college and civilian life for him.  He had different goals.  I did not cover myself with pride at his choice.  I was not a good military mom.  Matt's Boot Camp Graduation! The white cap to the left is Matt.For me Memorial Day is a reminderof all the sacrifice and pain our service personal and their familiesendure willingly to give muscle to our country and our leaders.  It is also a yearly reminder of my short comings as a military momand the regret I continue to holdthat I could not put aside my own personal agenda for my sonwhen he was choosing the higher (and the harder) path of military service.  Now 15 years later I am proud of the choices he made in his life and his service to our country.I wish I could live those 4 years over again and do the right thing!Now I salute him and the US military who had a strong hand in making him the fine man he has become today.My soldier, Matt and my daughter Kris.1993We learn from our children ...if you don't believe that, you aren't paying attention!Happy Memorial Day - a few days late!"},
{"title": "\"THE\" car", "date": "Monday, May 28, 2012", "text": "So it was a Sunday morning and I was minding my own business, just going about my normal Sunday routine, taking mom to mass ... when this car pulled into a space not too far from mine.  And I stopped dead in the center of the road - staring in a most impolite way at the sight of this perfectly restored car.  I could not believe my eyes!!  Here was a Fairlane 500 with the mega wings in the same green color my dad bought over 50 years ago.  Dad's car was a hard top and this was a convertible, but impact of seeing that car again in perfect show room condition was stunning.Actually I have no memories of any other family cars from all the years I lived with my parents.  I am not a car person.  But this car stood out for exactly one reason.We lived in an apartment complex in the 1950s on the second floor.  I was raised in apartments.  My parents never owned property and money was tight.  But one day, while mom was making dinner in the small kitchen, she looked out the window that viewed the parking lot and exclaimed:\"Oh my God, what has he done!  I don't believe it.\" WhatI ran to the window and saw my dad pulling up in this exact car - huge even to my eye at that time.  I remember the wings and I remember the color because I love green.  I also remember my mom's dismay and anger at him.  I am sure she was thinking ... where was the money coming for this vehicle?To be fair, if it was my husband and he had just purchased an expensive car without my input I would have been upset as well.  But that was my dad.  He did what he wanted, when he wanted.  He saw it and he wanted it.  So home it came home with him.Dice!  How cute.  We didn't have those in our car.Of course, here we were over 50 years later (mom and I) standing in another parking lot staring at pretty much the same car.  Then almost as if history was repeating itself, I couldn't restraint from whipping out my camera, sprinting over, and starting to snap pictures from all directions, calling out to mom in my excitement,\"Look mom!! (click)  Do you remember???Dad had this car. (click, click)  You were in the kitchen cooking dinner.  You saw him in the parking lot trying to park this very car. (click)You were so angry,  mom, (click, click) it was this car with a hard top, this exact green, don't you remember?\"(click, click, click) and her saying as she kept walking towards the church (pretending like she doesn't know me, I am sure), and saying pretty much what she said more than 50 years ago ...\"Oh my God, what are you doing? I don't believe you.\"Dad would be proud!  :-)Unfortunately, mom honestly didn't remember the car or the event. But it was a moment of fond remembrance of my Dad and sorrow at what Mom has lost."},
{"title": "Move My Feet Campaign - Review of the Striiv Pedometer", "date": "Sunday, May 27, 2012", "text": "I simply do not understand why this is so hard!  I am retired.  I have time to walk.  I am in good health.  I have good genes.  I believe that walking is the near perfect exercise. Experience taught me that. I am as young as I am EVER GOING TO BE.*sigh*The excuses I have used to avoid walking are varied but oh so familiar. I am busy.I have mom responsibilities.My son is getting married.  I got sick.I have bull dogs and they walk like turtles sprint.The weather is raining, dark, snowing, sunny, perfect (yes,  I have used \"perfect weather\" as an excuse 'cause I could do something else with the \"perfect day\").CrazyThe wedding is over, my son is married, Mom is cared for, I am well, the bull dogs would rather be on the couch in the air conditioning, and there are no weather-free days.I have set a goal AGAIN.April 2013 - at 66, I want to be walking at least 4 times a week and taking at least 10,000 steps every day.  I am still committed to walking that 1,000 miles goal that I started earlier in the year but reaching it by December 31 is unrealistic.  Any bets on what day in 2013 I will make that 1,000 miles?  Hey, maybe I should have a contest!!(If anything, I should get extra points for never ceasing to try!)So early last week I got a new toy tool (toy is the correct word, truly) - to launch this new \"move my feet campaign.\".Striiv Smart Pedometer is a fancy-shmancy pedometer. Yes, a step counter.  (Unfortunately I still need the objective feedback of a number that says - \"yes, you moved today,\" or \"no, (you slug,) you were a vegetable today.\") Now this new high end pedometer does more than just count steps.It counts the typical things beyond steps: time, mileage, calories, etc.  It also counts running steps and stairs climbed.  You can link wirelessly to other Striiv folks nearby to compete against them if inclined.  It has a touch screen for changing functions.  It needs to be on your body somewhere - even just hanging from a key ring.  No worrying that it is placed incorrectly at the waist like most other models.It shows your historic data by number and grid, and shows averages for about 30 days right on the pedometer.   A cable connects the Striiv pedometer to your computer for downloads of updates from the Striiv site and back ups of your stats on their network.  If you should lose the data for some reason (like a function failure) you can reconstruct it from your automatic back up.It plugs into an electrical outlet to charge rather than replacing a battery. While those features are a big step up in function over my Omron Pedometer (which I still love), none of those hooked me into this purchase.   My hook is \"the challenge!\"  There are a large variety of easy, medium and hard challenges.  Challenges can be selected but frequently they are offered spontaneously, \"how about climbing 50 steps in the next 15 minutes\" or \"increase your step count by 300 in the next 5 minutes\" or \"run for 10 minutes\" - and if I accept a challenge the clock starts counting down immediately.  If I meet the challenge, it gives me extra energy credits over what I earn by walking. Energy credits are used in a game on the pedometer (yes, a game on the pedometer!!) Wooo Hoooo!!!Of course, if you aren't shallow like me, you can use your energy credits towards a free charitable donation, which I shockingly haven't taken advantage of yet!!! Too busy playing my game.  :-)Stats tracking is reported in number and grid format.  It also shows you how your efforts play against certain fun measures.  For example: I climbed enough stairs to reach the top of the Statue of Liberty (achieved easily - my house is nothing but stairs). I am now working on climbing mount Mount Everest!!   I also know where I am in walking a marathon. Anyway, I am now off the couch and walking again.  Those dang challenges are like a red flag in front of a bull for me - I can't seem to resist.  And although I might not need this kind of incentive 10 months from now, it is a huge help in getting started.  In fact, I can already tell after one week that I have more energy.  My body has a very positive response to exercise - it is my brain that needs a kick in the butt!!So I had to buy this pricey pedometer to get walking again, but - what the heck - it is only money and I can't take it with me after I am dead.  (Hopefully this pedometer will hold off \"the death thingy\" a little longer - but that is not part of Striiv's guarantee.  Best Buy doesn't guarantee it either.  Dang!)I guess in the end it is really up to me!!Post Script - This little gadget does more than I have expressed here, so if you are curious, check their site at this  link.  I will tell you this.  I checked the feedback on Amazon, and Striiv was very well rated for accuracy and incentivizing you, BUT there were a few reported failures in function.  Striiv does provide customer support (online and phone) to resolve issues.   Since it is a new product and expensive, I bought my Striiv at Best Buy instead of Amazon.  Best Buy offers a 2 year \"fix or replace service\" contract for $15.00.  Seemed like a worthwhile safeguard for 2 years.Post Script to the Post ScriptI am not being sponsored by Striiv to write this post!  But if they want to pay me, I am OK with that!  :-)"},

No! Love can be bad. Bad, love, bad! Very bad love.Sometimes love just wants to go for a nice long walk.It runs you around the block and leaves you panting.It pulls you in several different directions at once,or winds around and around youuntil you’re all wound up and can’t move.But love makes you meet people wherever you go.People who have nothing in common but lovestop and talk to each other on the street.Throw things away and love will bring them back,again, and again, and again.But most of all, love needs love, lots of it.And in return, love loves youand never stops."},

I put in the oven to cook for 30 minutes (per the instructions)! That's when things started to fall apart!I checked it at 30 minutes.  It didn't look done. No big deal.I cooked 10 more minutes.  I checked it.  Still look raw in the middle.  hmm....I cooked it an additional 10 more minutes cause who wants to eat raw egg.  It still didn't look done. Crap! (What is the disease you get from eating raw egg???)I gave it 5 more minutes (a total of 55 minutes), then took it out to cool.  It looked like this.  It looked done.BUT, I let is sit for another 5 minutes to let the heat completely set the center - cause I wasn't sure it was really done.That was a total of 60 minutes!  The instructions said 30. But it looked pretty - and since I am not doing this ever again (because the stress of possibly eating raw egg is too much for me!!!), I took these pictures.  Proof that I did it once, or whatever.Oh ... and it tasted pretty good, but to tell the truth, I have had commercially made quiches that taste just as good or better .... so my first quiche is my last one. I'll leave this up to the professionals! :-)The wine I was drinking was pretty good ... but professionals did that as well."},

This week he passed away.I frequently visit mom with my grand dogs.  One day when Milo was with me, Win motioned me into his room to show me his dog.  His dog was in a picture displayed prominently on his dresser. The picture included  young Win (maybe a teenager), clothed in styles that were reminiscent of European styles 80 years ago.  Short pants just below the knee, a short jacket, and a cap.  And standing on his hind legs with his front paws on Win's shoulders was this absolutely ENORMOUS dog. Huge in height and breadth. Their heads were nose to nose.  Win's arms rested on the dog's shoulders. The picture was faded with age, but it was obvious there was great love between the boy and his dog.  That love for his buddy was safely tucked away in the heart of this 90+ year old man.  When I received the announcement of his passing and the planned house memorial service, I was instantly faced with the reality that is easy to forget sitting in my living room.  The passing of folks with great age is normal, expected even.  And just like my own mortality, I seldom face the fact that one day mom will be gone.  It is a reality check.  It is a reminder that our time together is limited.  As much as I struggled over the last year to hold off the inevitable for my mom, we all reach the same end eventually.Rest in Peace - dear Win.I know your buddy is waiting patiently for you on the other side."},

I am glad to see the end of the A to Z Challenge because I feel that personal touch will return once again to the blogs I follow.But I will be back in April 2013!  It is always great to discover new bloggers."},
{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - Seeing Me", "date": "Wednesday, May 2, 2012", "text": "Welcome to new readers.  This post is the latest in a series of posts called Through My Care Giver Eyes,  By selecting that title under the Labels Section of this blog, you can find the past story of my care giving journey with mom.    If you have walked this path before me with an elderly parent, you may see yourself in my story.If not and you have a living parent, this may be part of your story someday.  Mom waiting for Mass to start.Last Sunday I took mom to church.  We go most Sundays.  She has physically improved enough that she can use her walker and avoid the wheel chair.  It is a slow, slow trip from the car into church and back again, but she can do it.  It is a battle we have won over the last 5 months.In fact, she has adjusted very well to Assisted Living.  In October 2011, she fell at home (my husband and I were gone) and spent four weeks in rehab.  We were hopeful she would recover and return home.  After all, 2011 was filled with multiple hospitalizations, home PT and sub acute rehab, and she rallied each time. But by December 2011 it was evident that she could not come home again.  The story of that year and the 5 previous years are covered in other Through My Care Giver Eyes posts.But there were two people in this story. Mom and me.  I have changed.  Change is the only constant.Looking back to just five months ago, my emotions were in terrible turmoil.  A move out of my home was unavoidable.  Each day with her I was positively upbeat about the new setting, compassionate about the changes she must accept, and very present in her life to provide support.  But each evening I was filled with anxiety and disappointment.  Many an evening I stood at my kitchen sink cleaning up the evening dishes ... with tears streaming down my face.  I felt we had lost a major battle.Today things are better for both of us.Mom with Activities Staff at EasterWacky Tacky Wednesday Social EventCaregivers dress up.So did the residents!There are no more tears for me.  I am not anxious about her care.  She has wonderful care givers and lives in a beautiful supportive environment.  She has social opportunities and quiet times.  And she has been well for 5 months in a row (a significant record after all our struggles in 2011.)  After 5 months, she now thinks of this familiar place as \"home.\"And I have more flexibility in my personal life.  I visit with her four times a week.  No longer do I worry about her being by herself while I am away from home.  There is no need for a \"mom-sitter\" when we are gone. There is less concern that she is socially isolated. There is a certain level of contentment for me in knowing these things.But ... (and you knew there was a \"but\") ... I miss her.Sometimes she drove me crazy when she lived with me.  Sometimes her odd behavior and faulty thinking would frustrate us greatly.  Sometimes our lives and our friends had to take a back seat to my care giver responsibilities for mom.  Sometimes we felt very socially isolated because of her.  I know all that.But, I still miss her.Mom's front porch at Brook Grove.Secondly, I worry about the money.  This wonderful place is pricey.  Fortunately this community is aware of her resources, and there is a plan for residents as they \"spend down\" their savings.  But every month when I write that hefty check from her account, I feel really bad.  Yes, her money is taking care of her as planned, but she saved this money her whole life time. To her, these assets were a last indication of her financial independence. Although she is not aware of this, her assets are now shrinking at an alarming rate under my signature each month.  She has lost so much over these last years.  This feels like another battle lost for me.Finally I think there are still unresolved things bubbling just below the surface within me.  I  have down periods for no reason and lack of energy daily.  I have less excitement and joy in things. Is this just cumulative exhaustion from years of giving 150% to this effort?  Is it disappointment and depression caused by my \"but\" issues? Have I changed in some elemental way from the person I was 5 years ago?  Or is it something else?On balance, I think mom is doing better than I am.  I am content with that.I am better than I was. I am content with that as well.But ..."},

{"title": "W is for Waco (Texas)", "date": "Thursday, April 26, 2012", "text": "Only in a state as big and flat as Texas, can you get such a breath-taking sunrise.  These beautiful views were sent to me by a long time friend, Lorretta, who now lives in Waco, Texas. But the story is not quite so simple as that.Long ago - almost 45 years - I worked with Lorretta at the University of Maryland.  I was a full time student looking for a part time job, and she was the supervisor of an on-campus periodical collation service.I clearly remember that first meeting with Lorretta.  As a new employee, she gave me the typical tour of work site.  Moving towards the printing presses in the back of the office, Lorretta cautioned me that the lead printer, Mike, was a very quiet person.  I shouldn't feel put off if he didn't talk to me.  In fact he talked pretty much only to her and Mr. White, the manager of the unit. I shouldn't take it personally.  He was really a nice person, just very quiet.Being only 20 years old at the time, and being an outgoing drama (queen) minor in college, ... I decided in that instant that \"quiet Mike\" would also talk to me!  He would talk to 3 people in that office. You know ... in my mind, he was kind like a \"mountain to climb.\"Well, the rest is history.  Lorretta's casual comment changed my life.  She introduced me to the man who I would spend the next 44 (and counting) years with.  She peaked my interest to know him better.  Mike did talk to me (mountain climbed), and we did get married (other stuff happened between the talking and the getting married - but you get the idea.)   Lorretta and I became friends, and she and her husband were part of our wedding party.Now here is the really AMAZING part.  Our lives took us in different directions in the early years after Mike and I wed.  Lorretta moved back to Waco, Texas, her home town, and our friendship faded away.But this month I got a Facebook \"friend\" request from a \"Lorretta\" in \"Waco\" - the last name was different.  I accepted the request.  I did once know a Lorretta, and I knew she called Waco her home.  I took a chance that this was the same person.After a few emails and a wonderful phone call, we are thrilled to be once again in touch with each other.  I am happy to find Lorretta to be the same giving person I remember, and to have her friendship back is a gift.A Waco Gift,of course, along with that magnificent sunrise!"},

It makes me a little sad that so many of my handsome wooden men are packed away (probably permanently), but it does give me pleasure to spot light one of these guys on A to Z."},

{"title": "S is for Seniors", "date": "Saturday, April 21, 2012", "text": "One day recently I went for a walk around a local lake.  There were many visual delights that day, but one lingers in my memory and touched my heart.  An elderly couple was sitting on a bench quietly enjoying the lake view together.  They seemed perfectly content to sit companionably.  There was no pressure to converse, no sense of urgency to go on to the \"next thing.\"  Time didn't seem important.  They were very comfortable in each other's company.Of course the obvious assumption is that they are a long married retired couple spending a quiet afternoon together.  But maybe not.  Maybe they are just close friends or affectionate siblings.  The one thing that need not be assumed ... they know each other well and are able to spend quality time together in restful repose.I love this picture even though I had to sneak around behind them to take it.  :-)  To me it speaks of the possibility of a perfect senior relationship, one that is refined by the passage of time and clarified by life's pot holes.  It can be one of the rewards of being a senior."},
{"title": "R is for Rascal", "date": "Friday, April 20, 2012", "text": "Milo is a rascal!When Milo was a puppy his \"rascal nature\" was evident.  We just didn't recognize it at the time. For example, now as an adult, we have come to understand that all bones belong to Milo.  I mean ALL bones.  No other dog may be chewing on a bone in front of him because ALL bones belong to Milo.In this picture we see Milo as \"baby rascal,\" carefully studying the Meathead's jaw action required to chew a bone.  Milo was a very good student.  He watched very carefully.  Took notes.  Learned from the \"master\".You will noticed that another bone (Milo's bone) is located right beside his left front foot.  But Meathead made a strategic mistake.  He took a breath.  He stopped for just a moment to pause,  and to breath, and to rest his jaw muscles.  He let the bone drop, and ... well ... Milo quickly decided that Meathead's bone was better than the one by his own foot (you know, pre chewed, juiced up and all ... just better, because it was Meathead's bone.) Hmmm  ... Today ... all bones are Milo's (or so he thinks.)  No one chews except Milo.  Nothing has changed after 2 years.  He is a \"grown up rascal\" now.His full name is Milo Speedie Rascal Shanks.PS - Speedie was the name he came with."},

But of the few things I have, I treasure this letter that he wrote one morning before going to work.On that day I was to go on a girl scout camping trip.  The night before I had collected several items that we were assigned to bring - primarily eating utensils.  I had gathered these items on the kitchen table to pack with my other things in the morning.  Before dawn on that day, my dad took the time before leaving for work to write me this letter - to tease me about bringing these things from home and to remind me to bring them back.  But he also expressed heart felt affection for me and wanted me to have a great camping trip.My dad was not a letter writer.  He was not a reader, or a great family man, or one to have hobbies, or even many friends.  He worked and that was pretty much all he did.This 51 year old letter remains a treasured piece of paper.  These were words he wrote only to me, on a morning when he was his normal self and he was a loving father.I have so little of his beyond unhappy memories, but in these 2 yellowing sheets of paper ... I have much."},
{"title": "M is for Mom", "date": "Saturday, April 14, 2012", "text": "Mom has been an important part of my life for as long as I can remember.  In my early years she was my protector and guide.  In the last 5 1/2 years she has lived with me in my home and I was her protector.   In December 2011, however, she moved from my home into Assisted Living.  It was a jarring and painful change for both of us.But life moves on.  We both adjusted.The mother-child relationship can be a fluid one with many twists and turns.  Initially the mothering parent (male or female) is the critical link that keeps an infant alive and safe.  Later that role expands - helping the developing child, teen and young adult to fit successfully and purposefully into the society they inhabit.  Even at end of life, the mother has a role to play - sharing and educating her children to the rewards and struggles at the conclusion of a long life. These last lessons are sometimes missed or discounted.  What can a senior citizen, an elderly mother or father teach you?  Plenty.But these lessons are there to absorb if you keep your eyes and ears (and your heart) open. Thanks, Mom."},

Humans pull up the water bowl.11:00 pm - take the three dogs out for a short pee walk just before the humans climb into bed.12:30 am - Meaty gets up, wanders around the first floor, snorting a bit, checking for water, stops at the top of the steps to the front door, stands and stares for awhile, goes down the 4 steps to continue the \"stare\" in earnest aimed the closed door.  Usually we hear the sound of bully dog feet landing heavily on each step and canine nails on the ceramic tile foyer.  Humans figure it is better to get up and give him one last pee so we can sleep the rest of the night.  While putting his collar on, the other two decide to join him.  *sigh*3:00 am - Meaty gets up, ditto, ditto, ditto, to the \"12:30 am preamble journey\" to the front door in the exact same order with the exact same sound effects.  The other 2 dogs drag themselves out of bed ... because why not, you never know when you will get to pee again.  4:30 am - Meaty gets up, (you know the by drill now - the look and sound never changes), except that by 4:30 the other 2 dogs have caught onto the fact that Meaty either has prostate problems or is demented!  Either is possible.  But the grumbly humans keep up the same routine, because they are clearly demented.6:30 am - (The normal get-up time for Meaty when he is with papa!)  Meaty gets up!  Everyone gets up!  The dogs are chipper, happy to see the sun, eager for their regular morning walk around the block and a yummy breakfast, ready to greet the new day with joy and enthusiasm. The humans ... not so much.Last night ??Meaty was off his game!  Went to bed at 9:00 pm - got up at 6:30 am!!I wonder if he is ill ..."},
{"title": "The Dress", "date": "Friday, March 9, 2012", "text": "Clasp at the neck of the jacketLast weekend was supposed to be the great wailing and gnashing of teeth - tears and frustration - as I struggled to find a fancy something to wear to my son's wedding.Shoulder of the jacketI can't remember the last time I had to really dress up.   And if a business attire was required, a suit was adequate.So getting this dress caused me some distress.   No experience at picking out this kind of clothing.  No experience at wearing this kind of clothing. No experience usually equals mistakes.  And I couldn't afford a mistake at my son's wedding.Anxiety!The sleeve of the jacketSo we went to Nordstomes and Lord and Taylor - both places had pretty good selections - things I could actually see myself wearing.  I was less anxious.At Lord and Taylor we found the perfect mother-of-the-groom solution.Neck at the back.Separates - and not a dress at all.A shell top.  Good for May if it is warm.A matching long sleeve jacket with an attractive neck for someone who will be 65 years old (if you know what I mean.) Good for May if it is cool.A skirt that isn't a skirt at all.  Good for a woman who is more comfortable in pants.The shell and the jacket are black knit with embroidered silver thread trim throughout, very sparkly - a lot of sparkle for me personally, but my daughter assured me it was great.  And standing beside my husband in his Tux, I won't be an embarrassment. The pictures don't capture the silver reflection as much as it is in reality.The \"skirt\" is loose flowing sheer black pants that look like a skirt if you stand still.  Over the pants are 4 sheer flowing panels that give a further impression of a skirt when moving.  The hem is tea length - more mid calf.  I am sure this style has a name, but it is  just not part of my \"causal clothing\" vocabulary.Hem of the jacket.Guess you figured out by now that I won't be providing a full picture.  Snippets is all you are going to see until the Wedding Day.  Unless I am fully done up (hair, make up, shoes ... etc.) a picture wouldn't do justice anyway.Still need to buy shoes (no heels for me - maybe some patten leather flats) and figure out what to do with my short hair.  But the big \"dress\" mountain is now behind me.  Final note:  It is an evening wedding, the color theme is purple and green for the decorations and the attendants dresses are black. When I told my mom I was wearing black she had an expression of disbelief!  I had to explain that black was one of the new in-colors for a wedding - especially an evening wedding!  I don't think she understood.  And every time since then, when she asks about my outfit, I have to explain all over again.  I will show the outfit to her in advance.  I think she will understand better when she sees my outfit.  If definitely is not something you would wear to a funeral!  :-)"},
{"title": "Blog Hiatus??  Is that what I did?", "date": "Tuesday, March 6, 2012", "text": "My blog life has slowed considerably of late.  It is sort of like I took an unannounced blog hiatus ... and discovered it only after it existed.  Don't know what that is about.  What once blogging took up several hours each day, and now barely finds time in the week.  Is it a sign that my life has changed dramatically in some very quiet way?   The blog, which once held my link to the world beyond my four walls, that blog now competes for time and space with other activities.It is like the vacuum of time left by my mom's move has been filled with a new set of commitments, some of which look the same but are just ordered differently than before. I often said that I could filled my days with activities that took me from the house, but because mom was here, I had to hold back.  Now she is not here, and the subtle creep of those activities sneaking in are filling up my days.I think the next big challenge is to put constraints around my life, put limits on how I use time and keep things more simple.  For so long mom was my constraint.  It kept me in check.  It kept things simple, direct, focused.  But now I remember ... It is a great failing of mine to over commit, to fill up all the spaces of my life with activity and not leave enough time to \"just be.\"  And I also remember ... that behavior adds stress to my life.  So was this a hiatus, or just a wake up call that I need to be better at using my time.Anyway, I have missed being here.  Next blog post?  I got my dress for the wedding!"},

I was on my way into the pharmacy and just ahead of me I saw this small - (no more than 100 lb woman) walking a magnificent English Bull Dog.  You KNOW I had to stop and love that fabulous dog.  The lady said this was her second English Bull Dog.  The first one was about 55 lbs - Meathead runs about 45 to 50!  When the first dog died, they decided to get another one (of course), and they got Achilles - who didn't stop growing.  He is about 70 lbs and 3 years old.He was such a love.  Affection personified - if you could avoid his crushing embrace.  The owner warned me that he is a drooler and that I probably would need to change my clothes when I got home.  I quickly assured her that we have an English Bull Dog in our family  - so we are very familiar with the drool, not to mention the snoring, the burping, the passing of wind and all other bodily sounds!  \"Ah,\" she said, \"then you know!\"Indeed I do!

But walking around my neighborhood would not be enough for me today.As much as I hate to do it, I got in my car and drove to Lake Elkhorn - a small lake near my home.  This lake is near enough to walk to if I could do 90 minutes and didn't mind walking alone through some isolated wooded areas (which I try to avoid).The lake was filled with people today.  All ages.  Including this old lady.  (Geez, you would think she could comb her hair and put on a little lipstick!!)I especially loved seeing these 2 senior citizens sitting on the bench that Meathead and I shared all the time when he was a puppy.Seeing this lady with her little dog made me a little lonely for my grand dogs who would have enjoyed a trip to the park as long as it didn't include much actual walking.I have always envied the folks who live in these townhouses so close to the water's edge.  How lovely it would be to sit on the porch, and knit or read a book,while the world passed by. This walking bridge has a lovely bench built into the side where you can sit and read or just enjoy the view of the lake.  This man, it turned out, was doing neither.  He was playing a game on his cell phone.Go figure!This tree was filled with messages carved into the bark.Hope L + R are still in love.The walk today was worth the car trip!"},

Took pictures to prove it.  It was 50 degrees but for some reason I felt cold so I wore my long winter coat.  People were walking around in shorts and I was in my \"Nanook of the North\" coat!  By the time I got back I had at least thrown back my hood.  I sure feel cheated by this warm winter weather.Walking just isn't a habit yet and it is happening way to seldom.  I am even having problems with that \"little walking lady\" at the top of my blog.  For some reason when I go to the site to register the mileage, it doesn't document the total correctly.Oh well, as of today it should show 30 miles which isn't all that great.

And I also gained perspective and understanding with regard to the many aspects of aging.   I love the idea of sharing blog sites with other bloggers and I don't do that often enough. I have made so many unexpected blog discoveries from the recommendations of others.  And I love the idea of giving this award to another blogger.This is a new blog, and you will LOVE it.

{"title": "Because it is Sunday ...", "date": "Sunday, February 19, 2012", "text": "I took mom to church.I have been taking her to church since about 1997.  That year she was in an automobile accident and couldn't drive, but once she was recovered she said she enjoyed going to church with me so the tradition continued.Now that she is in Assisted Living, we changed churches.  We now attend St. Peter's Church - Roman Catholic.  I believe I have mentioned before that I was raised Catholic, but do not actually practice my faith as an adult the way it was taught to me as a child.  I consider myself a spiritual person with a strong belief in God.  I have had many conversations with him of the last 5 years ... most of them being with the word ... \"Why ...\"  :-)  And I enjoy attending church on occasion, but my inspiration and peace hardly ever is obtained within the confines of a building.But to mom, attending church on Sunday is very very important to her and so our tradition continues ... for her sake.St. Peter's church is a very traditional church and new within the last 10 years or so.  I admire its strong architectural features, simple lines and white uncluttered feeling.  The congregation has been very welcoming in many small ways and it is evident there is sincere devotion among the parishioners.  It is also about 5 minutes from mom.  It has been a good choice for us.  Today I put on my walking shoes and took that walk I was moaning about several posts before.  Here are some picture proofs!My right foot!My left foot!I brought them both with me this time!This walking habit I want to encourage has never been that big a deal to start - I have started it hundreds of times (as the old joke goes).  Usually several simple tricks get me going: gimmicks to track progress, audio books, picture taking, etc.  This time the problem has a different twist - it is logistics.  I am simply never home.  Now that mom lives outside my home I am on the road a lot with visits 4 times a week to see her and other activities that I put a halt to previously (because they took me out of the house away from mom), other activities have now exploded because I am not tied to the home.But it is just another challenge - and I know with time all this will settle out.  I have a to-do list of things I need to complete today (church and walking can be marked off), so I am off to do the other stuff.  And so another Sunday passes!  Hope yours has been good."},

{"title": "I struggle.", "date": "Friday, February 17, 2012", "text": "Here we are in February ... and I still have not been successful at taking back the habit of walking.Although mom's needs no longer fill my every minute now that she lives in Assisted Living, my days seem to pass filled with every activity accept taking a walk. And it frustrates me that this is the case.  So, in true Retired Knitter Style, I tried to examine why I can't seem to take back this one activity that is so important to my health and future functioning.I think the answer is buried in my recent life changes.  For five and half years of care giving, I have felt like a tightly coiled spring, ready to jump, always on alert, in a state of anticipation.  Looking back I realize that I used walking to release some of that energy.  At times I needed walking to clear my head, to provide some equilibrium ... it had nothing to do with being healthier.  And it wasn't done with enough frequency even then to attain any health benefits. But when I did walk, I did get an immediate release of stress and energy so it was a bit more easy to put on the walking shoes.Like the pendulum on a clock, I seem to have swung in the opposite direction over the last two months.  My coiled-spring response to life has relaxed.  Activities that draw me in are more thought-filled activities.  The \"need to walk it off\" just seems to be gone.  And the habit to walk for health and enjoyment is harder to start because there isn't an immediate feedback.  Building that new habit - one that you know is good for you, that you know will make you feel better - is much harder to adopt when the \"carrot\" is months away.So I think I know what is going on.  I wonder if that will help move that little lady on the top of my blog a bit more!!"},

They sure didn't waste any time sending me spam!No matter, the mental exercise is good for me!This will work just fine.Word Verification... is apparently one hot topic among a few blogs that I follow.  For those \"not in the know\" ... Word Verification happens when you place a comment to another blogger's post and a grouping of poorly shaped letters pops up - with a request for you to type those letters into an open field - all in an effort to prove that you are a real person and not some spam machine.I have always used Word Verification because on the few occasions when I didn't, I would get some bazaar unwanted comments that were obviously spam.  But it is evident from some discussions that it is getting harder and harder to read those letters and thus type them correctly.  Soooo, I will drop that feature from my blog.  I will install Comment Moderation!  All this means is that when you provide a comment, it will not show until I have had a chance to read and approve it.  The last thing I want to do is add frustration and barriers to the flow of comments in blog land, but I don't want to leave myself open to the idle shenanigans of a few crazy folks.(The idle shenanigans of my few crazy friends are just Ok.)"},

This kind of thing seems to happen .... oh, maybe only every 40 years or so!!

He wore a tux at our wedding 42 years ago. Now he remembers too!!LOLI have decided that EVERYONE should wear a Tux.  The women too.  Think on it! I am the only one in the wedding party who DOESN'T have her wedding duds. And I am feeling the pressure of that fact.  Where to get a dress, what to get, time going from one store to another, trying on multiple dresses, and ... (*sigh*) ... the wearing of it at the wedding! And then there are the shoes.  I need to get shoes for this event.  And hair - I need to get all 6 of my hairs done up!!!  And I guess my usual solitary lipstick would be lost in the glittery sea of my dress, shoes and hair - so full make up is on the list of things I need to stress about - and not just any make up but the full deal done by a professional.

{"title": "Books in my ears", "date": "Saturday, February 4, 2012", "text": "I love reading books, but now I prefer to listen to them instead. Since joining Audible, the \"reading\" of books has jumped a lot. I love that I can listen and do other things. Briefly I want share some of my recent titles/authors with you.  I won't share the story but I will provide links to Amazon where there are wonderful summaries and other reviewers.  This listing is just my impressions and may point you to other authors you haven't read.  Also, I read a lot of different things. This list trends toward  \"escape\" literature - no deep thinking stuff.  Scare me, make me laugh, make me anticipate, make me care - you don't have to educate me.  Right now - that is where I am in my life.  Next year?  Who knows.Stephen King Sadly, I am no longer a fan. Carrie, It, Needful Things, Pet Cemetery - just to name a few of his past titles that I thoroughly enjoyed.  But now, his new titles ... not so much.I bought the audio version of The Dome and listened to it completely.  If I had borrowed this book from the library I would have stopped about 80 pages in and returned it.  I just didn't care enough about the story or the characters.  I guess I was just bored!  Great idea though - a town that is covered by a clear dome - and what happens. But what happened didn't move me enough.A recent release of Mr. King's was 11-22-63.  This is a time travel book and was hugely hyped by Audible and Amazon.  I know that other King fans were also excited by its release.  I listened to about 8 hours - and stopped. I think I got bored.  I know I didn't care about the characters.  That is the death nell for me.  After 8 hours of listening, I feel I gave this book a fair shot. I also know that I am in the minority in panning this book. You might enjoy it. I didn't.I think that my Stephen King days are over.  His writing doesn't seem to capture my imagination any more, it is dark in its focus without the icing of the \"scare\" factor,  just depressing rather than interesting.  So bye-bye Stephen King. You and I must part company for now.  If you ever write something in the style of your earlier novels - I'll come back - eagerly.(Note: if there is a King novel in the similar vein of his earlier works, please let me know.  I miss the old-King.)Diana Gabaldon - Outlander SeriesI have blogged about the author and the series in a previous post (January 4, 2012).  So I won't spend much time on it here - except to say I am a huge fan.  I love big books, big stories, big characters - I care greatly about this pair - Jamie and Claire - and I will be sorry when this series finally end (hopefully not in my life time. LOL)  I am up to the forth book - The Fiery Cross.  This is a yummy series.  Jamie and Claire are now my \"friends.\"  If you like adventure, love story, steamy love scenes, historical bits that slip easily into the history of the time ... this book is for you.  I look forward to the next books. How to Knit a Love Story - Rachael HerronA Cypress Hollow YarnThis book, as well as 2 others, was given to me as a Christmas gift by my daughter and this is an actual book rather than an audio book.  (Yes, I still do love to read an actual book, to hold it in my hands and feel its weight, to turn the pages, to use a real book mark or to dog ear the page to keep my place ... yes, I love real books, too.)  How to Knit a Love Story is the first in the series of 3 books - stories that have only the town of Cypress Hollow as the common denominator.  This series is definitely light fun reading, fast, and themed for those who are interested in fiber arts.  And when I say themed ... I don't mean that causally - fiber arts is a major part of the story, at least in this first book.  It is a love story that reads fast, I care about the characters and how they turn out, and I always look forward to returning to the story. These are the stories that are filling my days.  There are others sitting queued up in my night stand or in my Audible Library.  As they rise to the surface, I will share them with you."},

I provided the pattern and the enthusiasm and everyone provided ... well, they provided everything else.   As you would expect, all the crochet-ers, moved forward confidently and productively, many crochet discussions evolved filled with crochet jargon, various yarn comparisons were made, hooks sizes were discussed, gauge samples were shared, a luncheon was scheduled to launch the project and we were off and running!!Well, most of us were off ... I was staggering way behind the pack - cheering folks on, of course, but displaying no idea whatever of what I was doing!Yeah Team!!! Go, go, go ...... ah ... ... excuse me ...What exactly is a single crochet?Oh yes, I remember now. And how do you make a double crochet?... hmmm ... I think I can do that. How do I \"read\" the stitches I have made in the first row so I can do the second row?Thankfully my knitting circle is made up of many generous folks ... talented knitters and crocheters who don't mind me sitting beside them each (and every) time I start another crochet row (questions, questions), who don't mind explaining to me for the umpteenth time were to put that first stitch in the row.Friends are like that.Now I am not relying totally on the kindness of my friends.I have a book!  It has great illustrations.I have yarn - great yarn!I have brand new crochet hooks.  Dig the fancy case.And I have a gauge swatch - well it will be a swatch when it gets a little bigger.And I have a magnificent helper!He knows alllll about crocheting.\"Smells like good crochet to me, Grandma.

It is another little gift my mom gave to me - adjusting well so that I could finally let go.And so I am closing out this thread of care giving blog postings with a reflection on Survivors.Thinking back over the last 5 1/2 years and even further back, I can see that Mom and I are both survivors.Mom has survived and recovered from so much over the course of her life.  Knowing that she experienced a difficult marriage for about 24 years, sensing her low self esteem and confidence at the time of my father's death, raising 2 daughters as well as she could - those early challenges created the mental fortitude of a survivor even before I became her caregiver.The last aging years of illness, disabilities and difficult recoveries revealed much about her. Losses continued to slip away - physical mementos of a life actively lived, declining health, reduced independence, and the loss of memories - those losses run very deep.Loss in Assisted Living can also be seen.  Although I visit her about 4 times a week and she is more actively engaged in social experiences, she has less regular contact with her family.  The risks in this elder setting are \"out of sight - out of mind\" for her family.And let's not forget ... she has survived me!  She has survived the reality of having a daughter become a care giver.  For myself, five years of care giving and dealing with the many extraneous stressors that surrounded that role - changed who I am, how I approach life, and, sadly, hardened my soul a bit. I've learned a lot about myself in this passage.  I have learnedto essentially listen to my own conscious - and shut out the voices of others who would do it different and who saw my path as somehow flawed.   To know that my own experiences and decisions have validity and that there is no one right way to do anything.to accept the natural losses of the very aged, to not impose my on agenda on the natural aging decline that always wins in the end. Yes, keeping fit and active are important goals for quality of life, but once the path of life is chosen by the very old, accepting that decision is an honorable and respectful choice.to personally let go and change direction when all other options are exhausted.to go from daughter to caregiver, and then back again to daughter.to accept I am not always a kind and considerate person - something I valued in myself for as long as I can remember.to accept the losses I have personally experienced - losses that are best left unsaid.I suspect am not done learning either.So this chapter closes for me now. The primary care giver has receded. I am once again a daughter.  Our relationship has flourished with friendship. I see her regularly and we talk by phone.  It is almost like it was before she moved into my house.  Almost ... except that the litany of losses still remain for both of us, but so do the survivors!  And, Mom, you may be more \"out of sight\" than before, but you are seldom \"out of mind\" for me. You are much loved in my heart!Retired KnitterDaughter"},
{"title": "Blog Following - a question", "date": "Tuesday, January 31, 2012", "text": "Now that the A to Z Challenge for 2012 has launched and hundreds (probably over a 1,000 again this year) are signing up and adding their links to the list, I am left with the same question I had last year!While I am \"window shopping\" through all the blogs, how do I know which ones I want to follow?Really, it is not that easy a question to answer for me.When I hit that \"follow\" button, I fully intend to regularly visit and read the posts.  I join that site because something about that blogger's posts appeals to me, draws me in, makes me laugh, makes me think, sometimes make me tear up, ... something ...  something that is hard to describe.When I look at all the blogs I follow (the list is quite extensive and not fully represented on my blog side bar), the first thing I notice is that there is diversity to the mix.  It isn't all knitting, or life journals, or cooking, or photography.  It doesn't follow a specific theme, like writing or religion!  So what is that indescribable something that draws me into a blog enough to say, \"Hey, I want to return and read more.\"  There are a few \"likes\" I know about:I like blogs that describe the life of someone who lives in a very different place - remote winter lands or other countries, places that I will never see otherwise.I really like blogs that focus on the home and on the ponderings of the writer.I love blogs that show a passion for a hobby like knitting or weaving or leather work or paper crafts or anything where you create with your hands.I totally love blogs where the writer has a quirky or humorous out look on life.So as I am \"window shopping\" through the A to Z Challenge participants for this year, I am looking for \"new blog friends\" to discover and follow.  And sometimes I discover a blog with something entirely different from my known lists of \"likes\" ... something I never even considered before ... something that broadens my world just a bit.That is what is so great about this challenge - the \"exploration!\" How do you decide which blogs to follow?  What are the things that draw you into another blogger's world?  How do you know when it is right to hit that \"follow button?\""},

{"title": "Back Mostly ... But", "date": "Saturday, January 28, 2012", "text": "So I am returned!  Mostly.The shingles eruption is mostly resolved.  The shingles pain is reduced and mostly controlled. So mostly I am better!The lingering pain is tolerable - the skin feels like a sun burn and the underlying tissues feel like pulled muscles when I move. These symptoms may fade with time - or not.  But if not, I think it is manageable.So the lesson to be learned?  If you get shingles, get medical help sooner rather than later - like within 72 hours of the eruption."},
{"title": "Slipping off the grid for a bit", "date": "Monday, January 23, 2012", "text": "I think I will be going blog-quiet for a period.  Not even walking to move my little person for a week or so.A week ago I started with a some shingles on my torso.  The last episode of shingles was about 30 years ago.  As painful and itchy as this is, 30 years seems like a good span between episodes!! And now one week into this, the symptoms are pretty intense. Anyway, I have been seen by the doctor who said I waited too long (you know, being a long suffering and stupid person that I am), for the meds they have to be really effective (even though I am on them now).  Meds should be started within 72 hours of the outbreak and I waited a week!!  So I am left with feeling miserable. So no walking or blogging until I am feeling better.If anyone knows of a way to lesson the symptoms let me know."},
{"title": "Are you hibernating?", "date": "Friday, January 20, 2012", "text": "This January seems slow.  Now I am not complaining.  No, not at all.  I am very happy for the lull.  But I don't know if I have ever experienced the confluence of such quiet all in one period before.  For example:I read quite a number of blogs.  It is nothing for me to open my reader and find I am 70 or 80 blog posts behind.  This week for the first time ever, I was up to date.  And for days I have seen maybe 3 or 4 postings - not the usual 20 posts.  Big drop. Bloggers have quieted down.  I listen to a whole bunch of pod casts.  I usually can keep up with these because I listen while I am doing other stuff, but I am always behind.  Always.  And yet, for a few weeks I am current - nothing waiting for a listen.  There is a lot of radio silence out there.  And 2 pod casts are officially ending.  The weather is stable - not too cold - no big weather.  So no excitement (or chagrin) about an impending snow storm or deep frigid cold.  Just a flat repetition of cool to cold sunny weather. For a lover of snow, like me, this lack of winter zest is most disheartening.  Listening to the weather on TV is just plain boring.Groups that I participate with have been a little low on attendance. Pockets of illness must be keeping people holed up in their homes. Mom reports that her meals at Assisted Living are not well attended either.  Out of the 16 residents who normally show up in the dining room, only 3 or 4 are coming to the table.  Trays of food are being delivered to rooms.  Folks are sick.  Keeping them apart makes sense. (Mom's still well, thankfully.)Has January always been like this?  In previous years have I been too busy with the stuff within my own four walls to notice the world just slowing down this month?For those interested in the Knitting Behind Bars InterviewHere is the link.It was an interesting interview."},
{"title": "Nuts!  Too soon over - the ride home", "date": "Thursday, January 19, 2012", "text": "I knew this moment would come. Nuts!I delayed the trip until 3:00 in the afternoon.  The roads were quiet going home.  No need to take pictures. Nothing had changed from the ride out.  But I had plenty of time to reflect on the weekend.I had a great time.  It was quiet, except for all the laughter, and the sharing, and to cooking, and the eating, and the crafting.  Hmm .... now that I think about it, it wasn't a quiet weekend at all.  :-)  I had taken a ton of pictures, but suddenly I realized I never got a group photo.  In fact, I seldom took pictures of people.  Panic!  Maybe I should turn around, go back to Ocean City, and get that shot.  No.  The pictures I had were perfect as they were.  We were not \"groomed\" for pictures at any point that weekend. My hair never got combed the whole time, often we just stayed in pajamas the whole day.  But those images that never made it into my camera - the happy faces - are tucked away in my memory where they will be safely kept.I also took a few other things home with me.The weekend began with the distribution of Goodie Bags! How cool was that? My bag's message reflected the feeling of these three days for me.  I will think with joy of that weekend every time I see this charming bag.I bought candy for mom from The Candy Kitchen.  She has such a sweet tooth.My cousin, Linda, gave me an ocean side oil painting she created.  She sent it home as a gift for mom. My cousins (both of them) are hugely talented artists.  This image says so much about the beauty of nature near the water's edge.As I approached The Bridge I realized that I was going to be provided one last beautiful image. Sun Set Soooo out came the camera once again.  And the snapping began.  As I took pictures traveling over this previously feared bridge, I realized just how much I changed this year. It is going to take more than this bridge to make me fearful.This year I faced down some hard personal situations.I came out the other side of a hard year. I am different.After the sun set, darkness quickly fill the sky.  By the time I got to my street, it was night.Soon I pulled into my parking space. I looked up to my living room window. Do you see what I see?There in the window. A pair of ears silhouetted in the light of my home.  Those perky little ears belonged to just one dear dog.Milo Milo was  expecting his grandma.And she was thrilled to see him.Thank youLindaLeslieSusanElizabethWe made a wonderful weekend.Until next time ..."},
{"title": "ahhh ... the Quiet-Side Walk", "date": "Wednesday, January 18, 2012", "text": "The bay side of Ocean Highway is considered the quiet side of the island/sandbar that holds several large ocean communities - Ocean City being one of those communities.Saturday was sunny and a reasonable temperature so I went for a walk - over to see the bay.  Ocean City has a pretty thin geography. It is easy to walk from the ocean to the bay (I try to ignore just how thin the sandbar is that I was standing on.  Being formed by a large hurricane in the 1930s, that sandbar could disappear just as fast as it formed in another storm ... but today - blue skys.)I love walking the flat streets of ocean resort communities.  Generally the houses are all different and many have ocean themed \"names\" on signs. All great fun!Of course in January there aren't too many people around.  The quiet of the bay side was more so because of the lack of occupants.  But it made walking around and taking pictures much easier because no one wondered what I was doing.The Ocean City neighborhood I walked through was called \"Little Salisbury\". Just look at how blue that sky was. (The sand bar I was standing on was safe from storms that day.)It was a beautifully crisp day for a walk.There were some interesting little structures.A closer look.Further down I took a side street and looked at the back yards!Really, guys!  The back yards.No grass to mow, no dog poop, no yards filled with kids toys or rusted grills or forgotten lawn furniture.I could live like that!Of course, at the end of the street is this ... the beautiful quiet bay!Later that night we had dinner/lunch at Liquid Assets. Guess the name relates to all the bottles that surrounded us, but the food was sensational!!And so was the company.Tomorrow: The trip home!"},
{"title": "ahhh ... the knitting, the weaving, the yarns", "date": "Monday, January 16, 2012", "text": "Cold! Very very cold at the beach! January - is just a cold month in my little piece of the world.But January is the perfect time to handle yarn and wear your furry slippers ... and that is what I did.First of all, the view ...The real view ....Other things that filled our eyes.Hand woven scarves - all done by my talented cousin, Linda.Yarn ball winding.Needle Point - this picture doesn't do justice to the brilliance of the colors.This is my loom with a brand new project on it - started (shamefully) last May when my cousin visited.  That little scarf is almost completed.Knitting, of course,  :-)Crocheting, too.Morgan, my cousin's dog.  A most beautiful face to match and loving personality.Talking and hanging out.Reading - yes that is a yarn pattern book.  Weaving DVD on the TVOk, so not everyone thought the DVD was interesting!And finally my yarn purchase!  I saved this until the end.I can hear those thoughts flooding through your brain (well, maybe is is just my brain)\"What!! More yarn.Have you looked in your yarn closet lately? Have you looked in the baskets all over your floor?Have you lost your mind?\"To the last question - well, maybe yes.  Just a little.BUT I have reasons in answer to the other questions.Reason #1I was at the beach.  This was vacation yarn.  All fiber artists know that vacation yarn doesn't count. Reason #2That yarn was kettle dyed and the color of beach sand!  Really ... do you need to know more?Reason #3They had the perfect buttons to go with the yarn.  See?How often does that happen?Reason #4The yarn shop owner's name was Elaine - just like me!!!So the yarn was coming home with me.  It was just meant to be!Tomorrow: My walk on the bay side of Ocean City.Yours truly ... meaning me ... will write a guest post on Blogging from A to Z.  The post is scheduled to publish tomorrow, Tuesday, January 17th.I participated in The A to Z blog challenge in April 2011 and I blogged about the experience in October of 2011.  That post can be found here.I am home, but I want to share the joy of the weekend with you.I am not sure how long it has been since I had a weekend away from home - shedding all the roles and responsibilities of my life.  But it has been long enough that I just don't remember.The trip to the ocean was wonderful. So eager was I to depart that I forgot to take pictures until I got to The Bridge. For me, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is The Bridge.Big.Scary.Thin.Over lots and lots of water. Lots of water.Lots.And I forgot to put the life vest on my Subaru!It is long - over 4 miles. It sways even in low winds. It is high. It turns a corner in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay. (Who thought that was a good idea!)I have spent probably 30 years hating The Bridge, but not today. No fear,no anxiety, no shallow breathing.  Nothing. Just joy at riding in the direction of the ocean.(I was even taking pictures, while driving The Bridge, for gosh sakes.)The country side on the Eastern Shore of Maryland is very flat. Much of it is filled with farms.  Some are abandon. Although a bit desolate, I love the look and feel of this picture. It reminds me of a painting.Three or four small towns dot the trip to Ocean City.It used to be more common to see small family grave yards in the middle of open fields. Many have sadly disappeared. The trip takes about 3 hours when you do the speed limit. I guess I got a bit bored!  Yes, this is me smiling for the camera ... that is resting on my steering wheel.(Trust me, there were no other cars near me! Trees with big fat sturdy trunks that might smash my new car entirely if they got in my way but no cars.  And no trees stepped out into the drive lane, thankfully.)  :-)Love my new sweater (Pattern: The February Lady's Sweater) that I finished blocking the day before.  Here is a shot of my sleeve.Don't ask how I got this picture!  Dig those buttons.Amazing color.(Stop it!  I am watching the road.)I have taken other pictures of this sweater with the idea of putting it on the blog, but the colors were all wrong.  Sitting in the car, going 60 mile an hour, I got the color perfectly.  Finally!Ocean City in sight.  I can stop taking pictures of my chest and arm now.Besides - my camera battery was nearly dead.Crossing another bridge from the main land to the sand bar that is Ocean City!  Excitement grows.So close!  Just over the dune.The condo and a reminder to treat our beach with care.And my goal! Just me and the beach!Perfection!How do you improve on this!Tomorrow: the people and stuff we did when not adoring the beach!"},

{"title": "Is it too early ...", "date": "Monday, January 9, 2012", "text": "... to do a walking update?(Thinking out loud and talking to yourself)You knew you were going to have a slow start.  Walking 3 miles a day every day when you haven't been walking hardly at all is a bit ambitious.By the 9th day - today - you should have walked 27 miles.  Your little walking woman is showing - as of this minute - 7 miles!  A few miles short ... So today when you dragged your butt out the door to do your walk ... because that little walking woman was beginning to haunt your thoughts ... you went over all the excuses of why you are falling short!They are BOGUS!  You berated yourself for being so willing to find excuses on day 9 of the new year!!  Day 9 ... not day 60 or day 200 or even day 365.  Day 9.  Pathetic.And then you started to think that maybe your goal of 1000 miles in a year was very unattainable. Think on it.  That is 3 miles 7 days a week, and even when you were walking a lot, you didn't walk 7 days a week. What were you thinking?  History would tell you that you were going to fall short of this goal.  Again, BOGUS!  1000 miles in a year is a goal!  Yes, it is a hard goal. Yes, you will need to do better to get even close.  But what good would a goal of 200 miles in a year be to you?  Worthless.And then it occurred to you ... maybe you could see just how close you could get to 1000 miles.  Maybe you could make 1000 miles in a year the goal again next year or at least more miles than the previous year.  Maybe you could take the long view on a long distance - 1000 miles!Yes, that appeals to you.  And who knows ... maybe by November your weary body won't even know when it has passed the 3 mile mark - maybe you will catch up easily.  (You probably should stop talking to yourself now because someone might be listening.)"},
{"title": "Images of a Christmas with Friends", "date": "Sunday, January 8, 2012", "text": "Sunday ... day of rest!Well, not entirely because I need to pull down all my Christmas decorations for this year!But before I do, I want to share some images of last night's party.  This party was especially sweet because last year was so dismal.  Our holiday in December 2010 was severely abbreviated because of mom's recent hospital and rehab discharge.  And this annual party in January 2011 wound up getting cancelled because almost everyone was ill that year and wanted to keep their distance from mom.  It was the strangest holiday ever.So here is the Christmas Party of January 2011 with some very dear friends and much loved family.  I love candid shots, and with the exception of a very few, these are candid.The table was ready - except for the mushrooms - they were still in the oven.Oh, there they are!  I don't think they ever made it to the table! They went from the oven into the stomachs with record speed.What is a party without cake!  Here is the baker.Here is the cake!  Pretty beautiful - tasty too.Time to dig in!It is the point of the whole event!My husband who makes a point of staying out of pictures!This beautiful woman is my daughter!Everyone should be lucky enough to have a daughter like her.  Lucky me!Of course, my granddogs would be there!  Of course!!Time spent with friends.Both faces in this picture are worth the shot! I love my camera. Grimace in a quiet moment - wearing his pooch pants!Milo focused on the fork!Meathead focused on love.My fantastic son with his wonderful future wife!  Gosh, that has a wonderful sound to it!Two great kids!Two future sisters!The last Hurrah for our Christmas Tree.It was a wonderful Christmas!"},
{"title": "One problem solved ... almost", "date": "Saturday, January 7, 2012", "text": "Remember that extra yarn problem?You know, the extra yarn problem in my new craft room?Ok, ok, extra yarn is never a problem. But my discovery of 3 full boxes of extra yarn after I safely (and smugly) got *all* my yarn into its new home in the upstairs closet (using a shoe horn), did cause me some concern.After all, that closet is a decent size and it is packed solid.  I was kind of appalled, (like always) at the volume of my stash.  That sinking feeling always happens when I wade through my stash periodically.  An unsettling vision appears in my brain of my stash showing up on some Hoarders TV show - yarn hoarders - with my face attached to it!Oh well, that is what doors are for!  :-)But then I got this great idea - Baskets!  Put the yarn in baskets in that room.  I don't know why I didn't think of that earlier. I have seen yarn in baskets before.  Very country. Very decorative. Very homey.  I can look at it decoratively displayed. Wonderful idea.But then there was the nagging problem of dust!  I don't want my yarn dusty.  It is ok if there is a thick dust layer on everything else in the house, which there usually is. But stand still for a few minutes in my house and a dust layer would settle on you.  So I got some Saran wrap to cover the yarn. Problem solved!But ...Another nagging problem.  I don't have enough baskets to store all my remainder yarn.  That stupid plastic container is still on the floor. It is still staring back at me saying, \"Hey you,The one with too much yarn.You, the one who is looking over her shoulder.You have too much yarn.I am talking to you.Too much yarn.  Too much.  Pay attention.Too  .  much  .  yarn!\"I think I will shut the door!Yes, I said I would be back Sunday.  It is Saturday.  The blogging habit has returned and the need to share some pictures of my company preparation just seemed to make the prep time more productive!Does that make sense?This party is a yearly event for this group. It was started by another member of the group more than 25 years ago.  She has since retired to Florida, and I volunteered to continue the tradition by hosting the yearly party.She set the standard - keep it simple, buy the food, use disposable dishes and cups, enjoy your company.   And since no one expects more, I usually follow in her practice.But each year I do make a few things that are more than she would do.  For example - Banana Bread totally  filled with walnuts.  No recipe - this is a package mix by Dole (the Banana people) that I get from my local warehouse store.  It is yummy!  I could make this from scratch, but being a devout non-cooker, I don't believe in making things from scratch if a wonderful option is available  (and yes, there is a piece missing - you ALWAYS need to check to be sure it is OK for your guests - and my daughter checked behind me to be sure that I wasn't wrong - and I considered checking behind her to make sure she wasn't wrong.) If not careful you can \"check\" things right out of existence.   :-)I made Deviled Eggs this year.  I love Deviled Eggs and they are so easy to make.The Stuffed Baked Mushrooms are the creation of my predecessor.  The mushrooms are the one thing that people seem to expect.  No picture yet, because they are made at the last minute. I always like having raw vegs and a tossed salad available so that those who are dieting have some options.  That was also my addition to this party.And the spiral cut honey ham is a standard - and it is the only time I have it all year.  I love ham but my husband is not a fan.  So once a year is good enough.  We include roast beef and cheese for those who aren't ham fans.  And, of course, I discovered that I didn't have enough wine glasses for the guests, so I ran out to buy new ones at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  Nothing fancy because I break them all the time.  Gave them a quick wash.While there I found a ceramic platter on clearance for $6.99 and with my 20% off coupon, the platter cost me $5.59.  I was thrilled. It had a decent design - but kept reasonable by being all white.Setting up the buffet table is always fun.  By the time I get all the things to the table that I planned, I always discover that I over-planned. Here is an early shot - a few of the dishes that will be used.But it always happens. Too many dishes.  But to begin with I just get dishes out on the table, slowly over the afternoon. Food that cannot hit the table now, sits in the fridge and the dish on the table is labeled with its name.So it is now about 2:30 pm.  No one is expected until 7:00 pm.  All I need to make now are the stuffed mushrooms - that are made at the last minute.My to-do list probably has something else on it, but I am not looking.  I am sitting - resting my feet and ...Visiting with you!:-)"},

The wedding is in May.I am sure that as we move through the next few months, postings about our preparations will become more frequent.This first posting on the wedding is the creation of flower table center pieces. Back in December Maureen walked a few of the wedding party through the process of making the paper flowers for the table center pieces.  Initially I think it was daunting for those present. So many flowers were needed, the process felt foreign to those in attendance, and it seemed like maybe this idea would not be do-able.Ha!That is not my style.  \"Not do-able\" is like waving a red flag in front of my face - and the bull in me shows its ugly and persistent face when the words, even the thoughts, of \"not possible\" hang in the air.  I was not going to be conquered by some simple paper flowers.In fact, if she decided at some future date that she didn't really want to use these flowers, that she had a new exciting idea for table decorations ... these flowers and I would knowwho was boss before we parted companyand I set down my glue gun!(You know, it could be said that I lose objectivity, that they are only paper flowers after all, and that I needed to get a grip on this!)BalderdashWhat I discovered in trying to master this new craft is that I really liked doing it.I am excited to be working on this project for my son and daughter-in-law-to-be .. but I would not be surprised to find more paper flowers showing up in my home after I have made the wedding flowers ... new flower types, new colors, new papers. ... yes ... We are not done with this just yet!!!:-)The white flowers with the print are made from paper that has the story of Matt and Maureen's meeting, growing relationship and finally their engagement.

{"title": "Outlander", "date": "Wednesday, January 4, 2012", "text": "Late in 2011 I launched on \"reading\" the series Outlander by Diana Gabladon.  I have the word \"reading\" in quotes because I am primarily an audio book listener.For those not familiar with this series, Outlander is the story of nurse called Claire at the close of World War II, who accidentally time travels back to the 1700's and falls in love with a Scottish Highlander called Jamie Fraser.  And thus begins an engrossing story that is both a love story, an adventure, and a historical study of life during that time - with a little bit of fantasy and sexy love scenes thrown in for good measure. (and, oh my, the love scenes are so juicy!  My daughter, if she is reading this post is probably rolling her eyes right now ... but her mom is just as human as she is ... so there!!)The series is currently at 6 very large books with the first book titled Outlander.   A 7th book is promised for 2013 - and it is also promised to not be the last book! (Yeah!! - Thank you Ms. Gabaldon).  If you love massive family sagas, epic love stories, swash buckling adventure, and peeks into the way people lived during the 1700s, then this is a story for you.With the largeness of this story, I was very encouraged by the author's ability to introduce new characters at a pace that is easy to follow.  So often the author feels compelled to throw all the characters into the first few chapters, leaving me with a dizzy feeling of wondering who is who well into the body of the work.  To compensate for that, I often write down a list of characters and relationships so that I can keep track as the story evolves.  Ms. Gabaldon paces these introductions so well that I never seem to loose track of the characters.The unabridged recordings are massive, as you would expect from the physical size of the books.  I am listening to Book 4 right now - The Drums of Autumn. It is approximately 44 hours long.  All the books fall in that range of listening time - so based on the 6 books currently released, there is about 260 glorious hours of listening.  The series is worth every minute - filled with wonderful detail, well constructed characters, and exciting adventure.  You will be glad the story doesn't seem to end!The narrator for the audio version is voice artist, Davina Porter.  She is excellent - handles the variety of voices and accents with ease.  As with most audio books, the narrator is very important to the success of the recording.  And successful she is, because she is almost invisible to the listener who is focused on the story telling rather than the narrator.So this is a Thumbs Up from me for this wonderful series.Note: for more information about this series - including all book titles and summaries, follow the link at the beginning of this post."},
{"title": "Short moment of Joy", "date": "Tuesday, January 3, 2012", "text": "I get as much out of reading blogs as I get from writing blog posts. And on some days, I get more from the reading than the writing.Today was one of those days!Thanks, Chatty Crone.It takes just a moment - please click here!You won't be sorry.This first week of January is always a weird week for me.  While the rest of the world slips out of the holiday mode and sheds their festive garb, I am still keeping up my decorations for one more week.Every year we have a Christmas Party at our house with a gaming group we see monthly during the year.  My preference is to squeeze the festivities into a period prior to January 1st, but those weeks are so busy that getting a date that works for all is pretty hard.  So for years we have celebrated this party on the first weekend after the New Years! Thankfully this party is pretty easy to pull off.  We typically have a spiral cut ham and roast beef for those who aren't ham eaters, store bought salads, I make stuffed mushrooms and a few other easy dishes and someone brings dessert.  And we exchange gifts.  It is a fun and relaxing time for all because we aren't competing with all the other seasonal commitments.Next week the tree comes down and the decorations get packed away - at least the ones that survive the yearly purge.I am busy with what is best described as \"puttering\" - and it is making the house feel a little more organized and settled - especially after the last few unsettled months.  I blogged about some of the changes a few days ago - and they continue. I still have a list of things I would like to complete, but for now I am happy to just take my time doing little stuff.  It fits in with my winter mojo - staying focused on the home and scaling down expectations.  I just love January ... I love the winter ... I love the fact that weather forces you to focus on the space within your four walls.And the birds have returned to my deck with gusto - actually, it is fair to say that the Cardinals have returned in mass.  I am always amazed at the number of Cardinals I have - it is nothing for me to see 4 or 5 males and an equal number of females every single morning.  They far outnumber the other birds. It helps that I put out seed they like ... :-) I am pretty sure that they aren't showing up because of my sparkling personality.And I am walking ... woohoo!!  The little person on the top of my blog shows 4 miles towards my 1000 mile goals.  Please, please!  Keep down the applause. :-)  I am just glad I figured out how to work the little person so it shows the correct total. My knees seem to be unhappy with this new push to be more active.  Little do they know that I plan to pick up Tai Chi again come this spring ... and maybe yoga.Visits to assisted living continue to go pretty well.  Mom seems to have moved passed her moody stage.  I have noticed she is moving things around in her room now ... sort of doing her own version of \"settling.\"  Last week I talked with her about getting her hair washed and cut this week ... which she promptly forgot, until the hair dresser stuck her head in the door this morning (while I was there thankfully) and said she planned to take mom (take her upstairs - not far) to do the cut today.  Of course, mom put up a small resistance, but I just barreled on saying that we talked about this last week, and she agreed, and she always says how much better she feels after it is done, etc. etc. etc.  By the time I was done talking, she was done complaining ... :-)  Works well for both of us.So the first week of January is pretty uneventful ... I am loving 2012 so far!  Oh, that's right, it is only January 3 - the year is very young, so much can go wrong!!"},

Usually Milo makes the trip with me.  And he is now totally comfortable in this new location.From the moment he gets out of the car, he walks directly up to the Assisted Living door, he struts with confidence into the living room checking left and right as he walks just incase he can spread alittle of his charm around to the residents. He knows my mom resides in room #10 - he makes a straight shot to that room and then begins to settle in!He has a bed there ... and a water dish!He has a bone there! Sometime he rests his chin on it.But where does he sleep?  On my mom's bed, of course.  Only \"dogs\" sleep on the floor!  He is a valued family member, and he sleeps on the bed!And the people keep busy as well.  Mom watches TV.I usually knit.And Milo, he usually does this!"},
{"title": "Christmas Eve and  Gifts I Love", "date": "Sunday, January 1, 2012", "text": "We took mom out to a restaurant for Christmas Eve lunch.  It was a lot of fun.  Not as good as having her at our house for dinner, but the next best thing.This year I got several Christmas gifts that I just loved and wanted to share with you.My son has started doing leather working and has made some beautiful things.  It is a new hobby for him and his work can be found at his new Etsy Store  Marrotte Leather. But his gift to me was a total surprise.I have had an iPad for about 2 years and the case I have used for it was pretty generic: black, plastic and ugly. He made me my own iPad case (actually an iPaws case).  It is pretty amazing. The pictures tell the story better than I can.He found these cute magnets on Etsy.  Recognize the dogs?  If you don't, you need to spend a little more time reading my blog!!Also got a bottle of nice wine and a gift certificate to a local restaurant.  Always welcome stuff.And my daughter checked out my Amazon Wish list.  Thank God for Amazon Wish lists.I recently discovered the Mark Bittman cook books (How to Cook Everything and How to Cook Everything Vegetarian) and I am now a total fan now.  I bought the Vegetarian one before Christmas and my daughter got me the original book. Now I know you are thinking - I thought you hate to cook!  I do, but I have to cook and I am always looking for cook books that are good references.  These two books are phenomenal.  They are the kind of books that you could almost sit down and read, except that they are hugely thick - over a thousand pages each.  But I have read full sections of them and found them very helpful.Also the focus of his cook books patterns my approach to cooking - keep it simple!  I totally love that.And I know that these kinds of books might not work for everyone.  They a absent of the typical color photography - the illustrations are line drawings.  But I can assure you that my own cooking seldom looks like the color photo.   If you really need a glossy color picture, the bookstores are filled with books like that.  In fact I have quite a few myself. But when I have a question I always turn to books like The Joy of Cooking or the Betty Crocker Cookbook - and now the Mark Bittman's books.  The books are really exceptionally well done, well presented and entirely useful for the novice and the expert cook.  You have a question about something and it is covered (even popping pop corn - he isn't a fan of microwave popcorn!).She also got me some fun books to read - books with a knitting theme.It was a fun Christmas ... everyone spent the night in a big sleep over!  It was a wonderful way to spend Christmas Eve."},
{"title": "\"Resorting\" to launch 2012", "date": "Friday, December 30, 2011", "text": "Resorting ... that is what my life seems to be about now.A lot of time has been spent resorting ... like space ... our upstairs den is a good example.   It used to be mom's sitting room, but now it is my craft room.  The desk in this picture is mom's desk.  We tried to get it into her assisted living room, but it wouldn't fit.  So it now resides in my craft room.  I use it to file mom's important papers and to do her minimal bill paying and bookkeeping.There are no before pictures, but here are some after pictures.This closet shows only half of the space my yarn stash occupies.  Slide the door to the left and the other half is just as full - floor to ceiling.  I was feeling pretty good about squeezing all the yarn into this closet ... very good, until I found another pocket of sock yarn stash that isn't in this closet.  It looks like this ...Yes, that is all sock yarn!  Enough yarn to make 80+ pairs of socks!!  Where that bunch of yarn is going, I haven't figured out yet, but the closet is full up!!  Right now it is sitting on the floor of the craft room making me feel guilty for having so much stash.All my knitting, crochet, spinning and weaving books are gathered together in this new craft space.  That feels pretty good.  Easy to see and use.On top of that book case is my weaving loom all folded up.  Once the dust settles on all this stuff shifting, I want to set up the loom again.  Beside the loom is a stack of magazines and patterns that need to be sorted and filed.My filing system is loose leaf binders sorted by project type.  There is probably a bunch of stuff in there I could get rid of given the time to sort through it all.And my spinning wheel is now housed safely on a round table near the yarn and the fiber.  It is dusty and I need to give it a little loving attention.  But it is nice to see it out where I could easily use it without interference from the various pets.  This picture also shows the other side of the overly full yarn closet.And I still maintain mom's bedroom - the room that now houses most of her earthly belongings.  It is ready for guests - since mom probably can never sleep there again.  It still makes me a little sad when I walk in knowing that she doesn't reside there anymore.  But she has adapted fairly well to her new room and home, so the \"problem\" of occupancy appears to be mine alone.  It will fade with time I know. But I fear the hole left in my life and heart, while smaller, will always be there.I am spending a lot of time moving other stuff around as well.  Although I am not a hobby cook, I do cook every day.  My cookbooks have never had an adequate home.  Initially they were in a book case in the living room, then in a book case in the basement (a worse location), and then stacked in a kitchen cabinet ... closer to the action, but hard to see and harder to use.  Our eat in kitchen no longer needs space for a walker, so I brought up an old book case from the basement.  And for someone who doesn't care much about cooking, I have a lot of cookbooks.I am \"resorting\" my alone time.  I have really missed my walks.  It is alone time and thinking time.  So for the umpteenth time, I am heading back to walking. My little walking icon at the top of my blog doesn't show the 1.4 miles I walked today!  I guess I am not working the app right.  Or maybe the little person on the graph is bent over in laughter at the 1.4 miles I logged and can't catch her breath to show the total ... after all the goal is 1,000 miles by December 31, 2012.  I only need to do 998.6 more miles!  Only!!  :-)Other alone time is also changing.  I used to value the hours between 8:00 pm and midnight. My mother and husband would have gone to their rooms for the night and I would putter around doing this and that.  Now I find my body slowing down and settling into the quiet before sleep - around 10:00 pm.  That evening time doesn't seem as precious as it once did.Maybe I am focused on \"just keeping busy\" so my mind doesn't settle on stuff I can't control.  Maybe I am finally free enough to do some long over due stuff.Maybe I am resorting my empty nest to change the look and feel and push away emotions.All I know is that at the end of the day I am very tired from all the \"resorting.\"Welcome to the new year everyone.Welcome 2012!"},
{"title": "2012 In Sight", "date": "Wednesday, December 28, 2011", "text": "Every year I say: I am not going to make resolutions or goals.  And I do it anyway!I have come to accept that goal making, having to-do lists (which in reality is what a yearly list of goals), is part of who I am.  No list, no goals ... no forward progress. So a short look backward seems appropriate now.In 2011 I had these simple ideas:Get focused - Who the heck knows if I achieved that!  Use 5,000 yards of yarn - I had an embarrassing amount of yarn in January 2011.  It is more embarrassing now.  (Retail therapy is a terrible thing.) I used about 4,000 yards of yarn this year but since I obtained about 22,000 yards of new stuff, I lost ground.  I enjoyed every minute of getting it, however.  Yarn collector!  That is what I am.Get Spinning - *sigh* - I suspect this was not a good year to establish new hobby habits.Get Weaving - better success there.  I finished a hand loom weaving project for my mom, a scarf for me, and I have a Weave-It blanket about 1/3 complete.  But I didn't make much progress on my new rigid hettle loom.Complete Yarn Projects - here I accomplished more than I thought.  I finished 1 pair of socks, but I ripped out the partially made sweater.  I made Milo his dog sweater and completed both a shawl for mom and a sweater for me.  I also finished some wash clothes and two brain slugs.So as far as planned achievements go, I did ok.  What is not showing on this list is all the stuff I plowed through with mom.  Thank God I couldn't see into the future to add all that stuff to my yearly to-do list.  I would have just closed up shop and left the country.This year I am keeping it simple again - 3 goals.Get Walking - I want to walk 1000 miles in 2012.  While that number seems like a very big number, it isn't.  Based on 3 miles a day, I could 1100 miles.  I know initially I will miss some days and probably not even do 3 miles, but as the weeks pass I should be able to do more and reach that goal.  And to that end, I have placed a little walking person at the top of my blog.  It will help me stay focused on moving forward.Keep knitting, weaving, spinning - stay connected to crafting so my emotional life doesn't stagnate like it did this past year.  Five completed projects of something would be nice. Oh, and use 5,000 yards of yarn.Empty Nesters  - with mom's move to a new residence, our lives are changing.  Some space within our home and our life has opened up. Hard to know what to-dos will evolve from this massive change, but it is a goal I recognize as important this year. Initially I have gained back a little living space. Mom's bedroom in my home is still hers. Even though she cannot physically reach that space,  it contains the important things of her life that she chose not to take with her to assisted living.  But her den has now become my new craft space.  Too soon to report on that effort, but I hope to sometime in January.  We are still sorting through the clutter (yes, I still have tons of it - even after the massive clean outs of 2011).   New motto:  Less is More (except for yarn, of course.)So the \"to-do girl\" with the lists and goals still lives on.  I am glad to see she still can look forward."},
{"title": "Eve of Memories", "date": "Saturday, December 24, 2011", "text": "A Christmas Eve like no other for me.I can't help be disappointment that mom is not home for Christmas.  Her inability to climb steps has changed so much for both of us.  Although I am ready to shed the old habits and traditions, but I can't help but desire her presence in my home during this season.When I look at my Christmas tree, I see reflected many past Christmases when my heart was heavy because of other missing family.  But I see other happy reflections as well.Meathead's picture on a ceramic ornament.Our tree has symbols of all the things that are important to us.  Most are cat and dog ornaments collected over the years.It may not be obvious, but that is a pug dressed as Santa Claus. Pugs love to wear clothes!Grimace would happily wear an outfit like this.Several ornaments represent the years my son served in the military and couldn't be with us.  Those were very hard years for me.My heart goes out to those family this night.And cat ornaments have graced our tree for all the 42 years of our marriage. In fact, for most years, cat ornaments were the entire theme.We have the hand made ornaments as well.  Here is one made by mom many years ago.We have the traditional Santas.And the not so traditional Santas (a cat, of course)The other not-so-seasonal beings that grace my holiday this year are my grand-dogs. They care not one twit if things are decorated or what gifts are wrapped. They are happy to be with their \"peoples.\"  The rest is unimportant.And that is how I feel this season.Thank you for visiting my blog this year during so much of my upheaval and turmoil. I may not be able to gather all my \"peoples\" around me this holiday, but I have got most them.I am blessed!Mom, you are missed."},

Food shopping is done, a visit to the liquor store also completed (got wine and some Bailey's - a special treat for Christmas Eve).We have barely 2 days left. Left on my Christmas To-Do list?  Put away the groceries I bought (*sigh*), bake chocolate cookies, take mom for a Christmas Eve lunch at a restaurant, Christmas Eve dinner to make and Christmas Day morning Mass with mom.  Then I am done!Well, ... at least for the weekend.We have a Christmas party in early January with friends and family at my house which is part of our holiday celebration.After that party, the Christmas tree and holiday decorations get packed away and we settle into \"Glorious January.\"  Have I mentioned recently that I am a winter lover?  Well, I am.I love everything about winter.I love the cold weather when you can snuggle down in your home or head outside bundled up in your long winter coat (mine is from L.L. Bean - I will feature my wonderful new winter coat in a future post) that covers you from the top of your head down to your ankles.I love the threat and the reality of snow storms - everything looks so clean and simple covered in snow. I don't even mind shoveling snow.  All the neighbors are out - it is a great community building opportunity.I love being home bound when the roads aren't passable.  Yes, I have a wonderful new Subaru that can easily handle the snow and I am a great snow driver ... but I choose to be snow bound!!!   Don't challenge the logic of this thinking!  :-)I love wearing my hand knit wool items to keep warm. I especially love knitting them in my home while the winds are blowing strongly outside.I love feeding the birds who have chosen to stay close to my home because I feed them in the cold weather.  I feel a responsibility to those little lives.I love the long shadows of bare trees caused by the lower level sun in the sky and the long cold winter nights sleeping under thick quilt.  The darkness reminds me that I am on a massive planet with ebbs and flows of light and dark.I love the comfort foods of winter: chili, stew, mac and cheese.   I know, where are the fresh veggies of summer?  Ok, you can't have everything.  Yes, I am eager to get past the pressures of the holiday season with its unending to-do lists and settle into the predictable, quiet, and cosy winter months.I am a child of winter.  Winter is my season."},
{"title": "Lights, camera ... knit ... behind bars", "date": "Wednesday, December 21, 2011", "text": "Yes, I said behind bars - not drinking bars - jail-like bars!I belong to a large local knitting group called Columbia Sip and Knit.  Members number over 400.  I know you must be wondering - how does jail and knitting link together!! Be patient.Our founder, Lynn, started with no members on that very first day several years ago and built Columbia Sip and Knit into the massive following she now coordinates.  But no sooner did that endeavor take off, than she was looking towards another goal. She knew the value of knitting as a personal stress reliever.  She saw the community feeling that this craft encouraged.  And she was a dynamic personality with a big (and unusual) idea. To her mind, a \"simple\" challenge ... teaching male prisoners to knit and discover how calming and meditative the craft can be.I can hear your thoughts now.  Guys on the wrong side of the law, guys who have tattooed messages on their bodies, guys who live in the challenging and sometimes ugly environment of prison - those guys - they would never pick up needles to knit.  A girly hobby?  Never.   And initially she heard that from the wardens.  Fortunately she marches to her own drum.  She persisted.  And she finally succeeded with one warden (a woman warden in a man's prison - let's hear it for women) and Knitting Behind Bars was born.  Her program is going strong after several years.  She visits weekly for two hours with prisoners in a pre-release program. She quickly reminds new-bees that knitting began as a male activity - invented by males - and that male knitters are gaining in numbers once again. They knit comfort dolls for rescue workers to give to traumatized children and they have expanded their projects to knitted hats for kids in lower income city schools. These men are learning to give back to their community in a positive way. It is also hoped that this positive skill may help them cope when they step outside prison life and back into society.And here is the real kicker of this story ... there is a waiting list of men who want to be a part of this group!  It doesn't get any better than that.Lynn, joined by her knitting buddy, Sheila are really making a difference.  At our Tuesday meeting this week, Lynn and Sheila were interviewed by a web based news group called Bus52. Bus52 is a year long project (52 weeks) for 5 individuals traveling around the US in a bus highlighting stories of people who have are making a difference.  Knitting Behind Bars will be one of their stories.  Check out their web site starting in January 2012.And so ... there were big lights.There was a serious looking camera.Sheila on the left, Lynn on the right.There were mikes with wires attached to your body - just like a TV anchor!!And there was Lynn sharing her story. This wasn't her first interview either. Here is one other link - there are others, but these two give you the flavor of the program. I will highlight this wonderful story again - with the video, pictures and the interview when it launches in January 2012.Child's hat made by a prisoner in the Knitting Behind Bars program."},
{"title": "Catching Up, \"dumbing down!\"", "date": "Tuesday, December 20, 2011", "text": "Life is starting to settle into a routine once again.  (You know, I really envy folks whose lives fall into a routine - and stay there!  Maybe that will be me someday!)But mostly I feel like I am catching up and dumbing down!My house is mostly clean. I would say that if the cats stopped shedding hair and we didn't use the toilets, it would stay that way.  Some spaces are not up to snuff - but that is what doors are for - right?My Christmas newsletters are done, stuffed in envelopes, addressed, stamped and in the mail box.  WooHoo!! What is amazing is that I reached this stage before Christmas. My Christmas shopping is complete.  Yeah!  And Double Yeah for the Internet.  Man, I so hate shopping malls this time of year.  Still need to wrap stuff, but I am not struggling to buy \"just one more thing.\"  No stockings this year either.The Christmas tree is decorated.  And mom's assisted living room is decorated too.  And after Christmas, I am seriously going to discard any decorations that haven't been out of their boxes for years.  Why am I keeping all that stuff?  And I am seriously thinking of a smaller tree for next year.Christmas cookies?  I used to make several types, but it has come down to just chocolate chip cookies now - my husband's favorite.  Last year I made liver cookies for my grand-dogs.  I had them sitting out on the counter to cool down and I moved on to other things. My husband drifted through the kitchen and then found me in the living room.  His comment? \"Those aren't chocolate chips cookies are they,\" he asked while still chewing.  :-) Liver cookies are pretty unremarkable cookies ... unless you are a dog!  So chocolate chips will be made before Christmas eve.  I'll skip the rest.  Don't need the calories and can't resist eating them if they are made.  I'll struggle enough with the chocolate chips in the house.  And the grand-dogs?  They aren't all that particular.  They eat tomatoes for treats and are happy!Really ... there is nothing wrong with dumbing down or simplifying!  Life is complex enough without adding additional layers to it."},
{"title": "New Empty Nester Fills Her Day", "date": "Wednesday, December 14, 2011", "text": "So it occurred to me a few days ago that I finally reached the status of an \"empty nester.\"Although my \"children\" left home many years ago, I always seemed to have others residing with me ... either returning children for short periods or another relative.  And I have always welcomed those new residents. But now my kids are independent and other possible residents have thinned out.  It is just my husband and I.I guess my husband and I will get a chance to see if we can still make it together!  :-)  Actually the stresses of the last year have tested this 42 year old marriage in ways I never imagined ... and we are still together.  I doubt our lives now will result in anything different.  A comfort!Of course, mom is still very much a part of my day.  I see her almost daily for about 2 hours.  Some visits are difficult with moodiness and anger - emotions unusual for her.  Some visits, like today, are pretty good.  She seemed happy to see me, we had a chance to visit privately, and we joined other residents for a game later in the morning.  She will be riding out to see Christmas Lights with others from Brooke Grove this evening.  She probably is looking forward to that.I am busy sorting through the \"caves of possessions\" in my home for both mom and myself in an effort to clean out and thin out \"stuff\".  Mom has boxes in her closets that she never unpacked 5 years ago.  The time is right to go through the boxes - get rid of stuff she can't use and probably doesn't remember - and bring items to her that she might enjoy.  My own possessions continue to \"reproduce\" at an alarming rate.  Sorting through our stuff has been an ongoing activity this year (especially when I was upset - which was often), and shedding stuff will continue.  The Den in my basement is so full, it should be considered unsafe.  Now mostly what is down there is yarn and fiber - so a falling injury is unlikely, but a smothering event is possible.  :-)And yesterday I got a piece of mail I have been expecting.  My Medicare Card from the Department of Health and Human Services.  Isn't it wonderful that the Federal Government thought to remind me of my advancing age!!!  Oh well, 2012 is the year when I turn 65.  I guess it is time.I am behind on Christmas stuff, but in my new mode of simplifying and stepping out from under the weight of traditions, I am not stressed by the impending holiday. For Christmas this year, we will take mom out for lunch on Christmas Eve.  Our \"big\", but small dinner on Christmas Eve will be our family celebration with gift giving after dinner.  Maybe my kids will plan to spend the night like last year.  That was great fun.  Of course, my son and his fiancee must balance the needs of 2 families now.  Christmas morning I will return to take mom to mass.  Christmas Day dinner will be left overs.  I think this Christmas will work out just fine.And for a change, I am looking at things that I can add back into my life instead of what I did this year - dropping things. Knitting and blogging have returned.  I think about my loom with a newly started project on it from last May.  Weaving has passed my mind frequently.  I am thinking about walking again and maybe returning to Tai Chi in the spring.  And when I get up in the morning I am so very stiff.  It reminds me that Yoga was a part of my life at one time and it made a huge difference in how I felt.  Yes, I can see a number of things in my future.  In fact, it amazes me how many things I stopped in 2011.My personal sadness is lifting a bit as I see mom beginning to adjust to her new home.  Today the nursing assistant said that mom is a very pleasant and a happy person.  So despite the occasional sad face she shows me, I know she is putting down roots.My empty nest is fairly quiet now, but my brain is buzzing with possibilities."},
{"title": "Coping ... and keeping busy.", "date": "Monday, December 12, 2011", "text": "I feel like my life now is all about coping!I am coping with the loss of mom in my home.  Nothing more can be said about that.  It is a terrible place to be.I am coping with my return to blogging.  I took a peak at the blog posts I have missed - 668!!!   Breath-taking.  But I am committed to my blog and my blogging community.  I will work through this - it will be a good distraction for me.  I am down around 500 back log postings so I am making a dent.I am coping with the upcoming holiday.  At least this year we are more prepared than last year. Our holiday will be much quieter than in the past and very different.  But curiously I am grateful for the quiet!  The last few years have felt almost like a \"habit\" - everything was the same.  And the traditional habits didn't provide the traditional comforts any more.  It seemed more like obligations.  Last year was a dreadful holiday because I felt the pressure of trying to maintain some sort of tradition while in the midst of dealing with mom's month long health issues.  This year I feel a bit more freedom - no need to conform. I am coping with my need to keep busy.  Busy helps fill the vacant spots I now seem to have.  I am cleaning my house (a sure sign I am upset), I am listening to my books on tape (having a constant voice to distract me keeps other thoughts at a distance), and I am thinking about all the personal physical activities I have abandon this year and want to take back so that I can deal with my emotions again (walking, Tai Chi, Yoga).   And I am coping better because I am still knitting.  When things heated up again this fall, I resolutely continued to knit.  I picked up those needles even if all I wanted to do was stab them into my couch.  I didn't :-) ... I used them to create, to keep my hands busy, to force peace into my brain.  Knitting, my dear friend.  I really need to take some pictures of what I am working on and post them.  I have one sweater almost done - that I started in October.I am coping."},
{"title": "Through My Caregiver's Eyes - Christmas At Brooke Grove", "date": "Sunday, December 11, 2011", "text": "Today was Christmas Family Day at Brooke Grove - Sandy Spring Assisted Living.It is a good time to introduce you to this wonderful community.Sandy Spring Assisted Living is part of the Brooke Grove Retirement Community.  Set on 220 wooded acers, this lovely place includes Independent Living, Assisted Living, Skilled Nursing and Rehab.  It is a continuing care retirement community.  This means that as mother's level of care changes, she will remain \"under their umbrella.\"  Since I have seen the excellent care the nursing home residents receive, it is a comfort to know she is in a good place for the rest of her years.The staff at both rehab and assisted living are excellent.  In the short week she has been there, I have seen some of the sensitivity shown to her.  Mom resisted some personal hygiene assistance and the assistant honored her wishes and backed off.  But they continue to strive to gain her trust.  Of course, they are strangers to mom. It will take time for her to feel comfortable with these new faces.  But I know she will eventually.  She had bonded with the rehab staff.  On our last day there were genuine hugs all around.  They were sorry to see her go ... and mom felt the same emotion.One large improvement is the social opportunities available to her.  On her second day she had a hand massage - something her old arthritic fingers really enjoyed.  She attended a music and hot chocolate social, and met with a small group of residents and the chaplain for a talk.  There is always something to do if you want to participate.Today the holiday festivities at Brooke Grove are in full swing.  Families are invited to attend a celebration with their loved one. There was live music and food.  Mom made her way to the dessert table for her \"second dessert.\" I think she really enjoyed it.It was nice to meet some of the family members of other residents.  It is not like home but today it felt just as festive. Of course, tonight I am thinking again about her, wondering what she is doing.  By 9:00 pm, she is probably in bed and maybe asleep.  I can't help but wish she was asleep upstairs in her bedroom in my home.  I know I shouldn't torture my self with these thoughts, but the nights are the hardest time for me.  I know time is the only really healer.Thank you all for you wonderful comments to my post yesterday.  Each one made me tear up a bit.  I am really trying very hard to look forward and see all the positives.  And there are tons of positives.  But there is also 5 years of care giving history I carry with me.  It is going to take me a bit of time to adjust to my new role. I'll get there.  I am a survivor.  But I am wearing a few \"band aids\" now on my heart."},
{"title": "Hello?  Is anyone out there still?", "date": "Saturday, December 10, 2011", "text": "I sure hope so.  I have missed my blog home and my blog friends.  I have missed writing.  I feel like I have been un-anchored and set adrift.  I feel like my previous life - my life before mom - is back and I don't feel comfortable with that new reality. Mom went into Assisted Living 5 days ago.  After 4+ weeks of sub acute rehab, it was determined that she could not safely return home.  She could not get up the 20 steps she needed to climb to get into my house and she could not be left alone ever again.  Although hearing that determination was hard, it was not surprising.  I could see that she was not progressing as quickly as before.  Her strength was still serious limited. Physical Therapy said that she had \"plateaued\" in her progress, and as a result must be released from therapy.  And so we worked to find a good place for her to live, one where I could rest easy that she was being taken well care of, and that she would have a social network to keep her occupied.  Brooke Grove was the final choice ... the same community that provided her rehab.  The setting, the staffing and the quality of attention to detail are outstanding in this organization.  We were very lucky that she was accepted into this Assisted Living setting.  Pictures and stories will still filter through my blog because I am still her regular daily companion, if not her primary caregiver.But ...I miss her more than you can ever know.  The nights are the worst for me.  I shed tears every night for what we have lost.  I know she is sitting in her recliner watching TV in her new room ... just as we did together almost every night in my living room.  But we are apart now and it weighs very heavy on my heart.  I visit almost every day. She is angry at times, and she has a right to be angry.  Her life has changed so much.  And I am sad beyond understanding, and I have a right to be sad because this was not what I wanted.  But our lives are changing and we both must adjust.Tomorrow is the Holiday Family Party at her Assisted Living and I will have my camera handy.  I will share our new lives with you.  But please know that despite the smiling faces in the pictures, there is an internal struggle for us all.  Gosh ... I sure do hope someone is still out there!"},
{"title": "Thankful for a difficult year", "date": "Thursday, November 24, 2011", "text": "Traditionally people reflect on all to good things in their lives this time of year.  As I reflect on this year all I can see are the struggles, disappointments and losses.And still I am thankful.  I have learned a lot about who I am. And I have learned to change my view of life.I managed to keep mom in my home for the most difficult year of both our lives.I lost a very close family relationship ... one that I thought would be with me until the day I died ... and discovered I could manage without her.I grew to realize I could not be \"all\" for my mom, that I had to let go, and give up her care to others more able to manage the challenge of her declining abilities.I said a quiet goodbye to a dear uncle and celebrated the wonderful life he lead and the family he left behind.I found unanticipated support and strength in friends who walked this path before me.  I rediscovered the fact that I have the best kids in the entire world.  I know this for a fact.  Don't bother to argue with me.It hasn't been the best year of my life and it may not be the worst - but it will probably count in the top 3 of worst years for sure.You never really know how strong you are until you are tested.  This year was nothing but a litany of tests.  I passed a few, I bent under a few,  and I probably failed a few.  But I am glad to discover that I am still the same person, maybe stronger than I thought  - someone who is surrounded by a loving family, who is living by her own judgements, and who despite the worst this life has dealt out to me thus far ... is still standing."},
{"title": "A hard post to write", "date": "Thursday, November 17, 2011", "text": "What to say ...Today is 3 weeks since her admission into rehab.  In many ways she is less than she was, and yet she continues to improve in small ways.  Maybe I see the improvements because I look for each little step forward.  Maybe I want her to improve more than she wants to improve.Physical therapy says that they will be discharging her by the end of November.  But the discharge will include the recommendation that she has 24 hour assistance/monitoring. This translates to admission into Assisted Living or to an aide in our home for a minimum of 12 hours each day.  An aide in the home is not an option for us. Our townhouse is small.  My husband is uncomfortable with the idea and I am not wild about it either.  But my main concern is for my husband.  After 5 years of living with his mother-in-law in sometimes difficult circumstances, I cannot ignore the line in the line in the sand that he has indicated.  He also has expressed concern for the physical and emotional toll all this has taken on me to this point.  But what about mom ... After 3 weeks in rehab I can see that she is ceasing to try, to achieve, to remain connected to her surrounds.  She sleeps a lot.  She appears angry at times. But most importantly she doesn't understand that she can no longer do for herself.  She can no longer make the smallest common sense decisions for herself.  When she is awake she appears unhappy and no longer takes joy in the presence of family.  Some of this is fatigue. Some of this is discouragement that she is not home.  Maybe we are dealing with some depression as well.   But without her corporation and desire to do the work to get stronger, there is no way to physically bring her back home.I greatly fear that she can no longer live at home safely.  How will I ever be able to give her that news!"},
{"title": "Sadness, Joy and Struggle", "date": "Monday, November 14, 2011", "text": "My, how quickly the time passes.I returned from a quick trip to Florida to attend a viewing of my uncle who died this month. The trip was filled with sadness and joy.  The loss of this favorite uncle was hard to accept.  Yes, he lived a long and wonderful life.  But letting go of loved relationship that helped make you the person you are is very difficult and filled with sadness.  There was joy in putting my arms around my dear aunt, giving her a hug from my mom and one from me.  Her last care giving years for my uncle took a large toll on her.  Her work was done.  Now she needs to build a life of her own.  I would imagine that task looks like an insurmountable mountain after 57 years of marriage.  There was also joy in catching up with my cousins on this side of the family.  They also filled many of the memories  of my early growing years. Visiting with them and their families was wonderful. I called mom everyday I was gone.  I tried to keep connected during the days when she would have no visitors.But when I saw her on Sunday she appeared somewhat down and a bit restless.  Maybe the understanding of her brother-in-laws death had finally been absorbed.  Maybe she is struggling with the facts of her limitations.  But her desire to just \"go home\" seems to be growing.  It is hard to make her understand that she can't just be released ... that she has to be able to do some simple things - like getting out of chair unassisted and walking with a walker unassisted.  It is like saying I want to be able to run 5 miles this afternoon ... without doing the necessary months of work necessary to achieve that goal.  I wonder if she would understand that analogy.She completed 2 weeks of rehab and her doctor said probably 4 to 6 weeks were necessary.  It is going to be a very long 4 to 6 weeks, I fear.So I am back home and back to daily visits with mom.  Blogging time continues to be hard to snatch.  I'll be back but it is hard to know when."},
{"title": "Briefly ...", "date": "Saturday, November 5, 2011", "text": "Rehab for mom is going as well as can be expected.  I am happy with the place and mom is happy with the place but she would be happier home. She is still in a wheel chair, but I can tell she is getting stronger.My days this week seem to be mostly on the road.  Now in addition to my other normal trips, I include a 2-3 hour visit with mom.  The trip out to her rehab is lovely, but it take 20-25 minutes each way.  Last week I visited mom every day, making sure her adjustment was going smoothly.  This week I planned to visit it most days - but skip one or two.That was what I planned.  But come the end of the week I will miss seeing her for 3 days in a row.I got a call this morning that my Uncle (my most favorite Uncle) had died in Florida.  Today has been very hard.  I couldn't seem to restrain my tears.  So many fond memories from my youth of visits to my Aunt and Uncle's house flooded my brain today.  And with each memory, tears of sorrow at his passing.This Uncle was married to my mom's  sister.  They would have celebrated 57 years of marriage tomorrow!  So much sadness.The viewing is in Florida at the end of the week.  Since mom is safely housed in rehab, my sister and I will travel to Florida for the viewing.  So the week has been hard on a few levels.  I am bone tired and emotionally drained.  I hope this thunder cloud that persists in following me this year passes on soon.I just need a break.***Blogging will be sparse for awhile.  Time has suddenly become pretty tight this week."},

This will be a very difficult period."},
{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - Resilience", "date": "Friday, October 28, 2011", "text": "Yesterday mom was admitted to Sub Acute Rehab to recover from the fall she took last week.Once again we crossed the threshold of that wonderful nursing facility that we visited about 10 months ago.I couldn't help but compare the two visits.In December 2010 mom and I were both new-bees to the rehab experience.  We didn't know what to expect and what would be required.  We were both tired and anxious that month.  Mom had been pretty sick and was very weak.  Neither of us was standing tall on that first visit.  Thankfully we landed in a wonderful community that propped us up and got us back on track - health wise!  And I learned a lot about what high quality rehab care was all about.Now, 10 months later, as we returned, we were different people.  Yes, we were both bone weary from the last week at home.  Mom is not sick but she is injured ... and desperately weak again.  But this time we were greeted by many familiar faces who welcomed us back.  It felt comfortable.  The first day procedures were the same.  We were walking a familiar path.  There was also a sense that we will once again climb ourselves out of the current hole we fell into and come out the other side at a \"new normal.\"Always a \"new normal.\"  Always less than before.It gave me comfort to see mom adjust so fast to this new but not new environment.  She had been anxious the days leading up to this admission.  No amount of talk could settled her mind.  She didn't remember her last experiences. This was \"new\" to her brain and she was scared.  But as the day rolled on she remembered.  The staff was open and welcoming.  She had exactly the same room as before.  She ate her meals with gusto (I think she has gotten tired of my cooking.  Me, too!). And when the time came for me to leave, she appeared at peace with it.  She said her normal goodbyes and I almost felt dismissed.  The elderly can be surprisingly resilient.  And I am different too.  I know her rehabilitation is required.  I can't do this at home.  She must stay as long as it takes to get her moving again.  There will be no early discharge like the last time.  Elderly issues can't be rushed.  Health and strength are not regained over night.  And my presence at rehab, while great as a visiting daughter, doesn't have to be 24/7.  She is in good hands.  Returning home, the house seemed empty.  Too quiet.  I already missed her and it had only been 8 hours since she left.  But I have a long list of things I need to do while she is gone.  I'll keep busy. I will visit her often.And I need to recover a bit myself. Thankfully, I am resilient as well.Retired KnitterCare Giver and Daughter"},

{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - Roller Coasters", "date": "Sunday, October 23, 2011", "text": "I don't really like roller coasters.  They make me vomit, and I hate to vomit.But elder care giving is a roller coaster ride - the only difference there is no vomiting, only sleep deprivation.If you read Thursday's post you would know that on that day I was choking and mom was falling.  I recovered quickly.  Mom did not.Friday we took an ambulance ride to radiology to confirm that she did not have any breaks or fractures.  Great news.  Based on a stat read of the films she was able to go home instead of the hospital.  Woo Hoo!!! Happy me!Of course I should have been a little more observant of the situation on the way to radiology.  It took the medical transport men (2 big guys) 40 minutes to get mom from her den to my first floor (maybe 30 feet). That should have been the first clue that she was not too good.  As the guys were passing by me in my front yard with mom strapped on the gurney (finally) and heading to the the ambulance, mom says to me with a poisonous look, \"I wish they were putting me in a wooden box.\"  Nice. :-(I reminded her in front of total strangers that only God could put her in a wooden box and that she needed to adjust her attitude a bit to make it easier on the people who were taking care of her while she was on this earth. And I had to say it loudly because her hearing aids weren't working too well.  As they all passed by, one of the transport guys gave me a thumbs up and said \"good one\" under his breath!  I think God made him say that just to give me a little boost!  :-)That was Friday.Since she fell I have been sleeping nearby.  Thursday night I slept in her den adjacent to her bedroom. I told her I would be there and she should call if she wanted to get out of bed. She never called me when she got up to urinate.  In the morning I was upset and reminded her she needed to call me so I could help her. The Thursday night passed without problems.  I assumed the same for Friday night.Friday night she called out at 2:00 am (good).  I leaped off the air mattress and turned the corner to find her hanging from the bed rails by her hands, legs bent, feet inches from the floor - unwilling to put weight on her legs because of the pain.  I ran over to her, put my arms under her 155 pound  body and lifted her dead weight onto the bed.  I have a slight frame and weigh 140 pounds.  We both were panting with the fear and effort.  I am still not sure how I did that.  My back hasn't been the same since then.  And then, standing by the side of the bed, the anger set in.  I was TOTALLY and BLINDING angry at her for not calling me to help her get out of bed, and I was even more angry at myself for letting things get to this level.  Since mom's fall she has been unable to raise herself from a chair and unable to walk - all due to muscle and or ligament injury.  There were no broken bones, but tissue injury can be just as hard to deal with.Once she was safely back in bed, I sat in her den - wide awake and filled with adrenalin.  I came to the conclusion that she was officially beyond my ability to cope, and I was angry that I hadn't seen it before.  I was up until 4:30 am that night sorting out my feelings.I sent an email to the doctor asking her to return and assess her mobility (or lack of mobility).  And after talking things over with my family, we decided that she needed to be placed in rehab again.The doctor suggest 4 to 6 weeks in rehab.  So that is where we are heading this week.Until she is admitted into sub acute rehab, I am now sleeping on the floor in the hall outside her bedroom where I can see her.  Attached to her bed rail is a coke can with coins. She can shake that can if she needs help, but if that fails (and it will) I will also know if she is trying to get out of bed on her own by the noise.  And what do you think she asked me this evening while sitting placidly in her chair?\"Do you think we can go to Mass tomorrow morning?\"  *sigh*This care giver life is a roller coaster.  I hate roller coasters.  I think I am going to go vomit now!!:-)Retired KnitterCare Giver and DaughterPS - postings will be episodic this week.  A lot needs to be done to get mom settled where she can get well.  I'll be back!PPS - you may also remember that my dear Maxima, Maxine, was failing.  We needed to get another car pronto if we wanted to be mobile ourselves.  We did, thanks to my dearest daughter who took care of her Grandmother for 6 hours on Saturday.  But that is another post!"},
{"title": "Can you top this?", "date": "Thursday, October 20, 2011", "text": "It was one of those days.Bright, sunny, crisp, cool and fall-ish.  Perfect really.I knew it couldn't last.I had 4 things to do today.  Piece of cake.Food shopGet mom out for her flu shot.Get the title of the Maxima from the bank - we are car shopping.Go pick up Milo in Bethesda.Grocery shopping went well enough.  My husband and I have always food shopped together all 42 years.  Mom was eating breakfast when we left. She was feeling pretty good today.  She planned to clean up the dishes and get dressed while we were gone.Arriving home the first problem was discovered.  As I walked in the door, I saw mom's feet on the floor - not in a standing position either.  She had fallen and had sat on the floor for 40 minutes in our absence.  We got her upright.  She seemed fine.  She walked very slowly to the bathroom and then went upstairs to get dressed.  But I decided we didn't need to go for the flu shot today.  I called her doctor, cancelled the appointment and the doctor promised to visit the house by tomorrow just to check her out and give her the flu shot.When will I ever learn.  Appearances are deceiving in elder care ... but I am skipping forward too fast.  So the next thing on the agenda for today was the title of the car.  I headed for the bank.  As I walked into the bank lobby a very nice attendant asked if they could help me.  I opened my mouth to speak and the partially chewed nut in my mouth slipped into my wind pipe.  I began to violently cough, to gag ... my breathing was difficult. People raced to my side, offered me tissues, water, lead me to a chair, I kept coughing.  I tried to take a breath and it sounded thin and ragged.  I couldn't fill my lungs with air.  It was kind of an out of body experience.I remember thinking, \"maybe I should be panicky, boy that inhalation sounds bad, gosh I can't seem to to fill my lungs\".  They asked if I wanted them to call 911 Emergency.  I shook my head no, but couldn't say anything.  Seconds later a bank manager said in my ear (while I am coughing, tears running down my face, gagging), \"Emergency is coming. I just wanted you to know.\"  They pulled  up, brought the gurney into the lobby.  Other thoughts popped in my head, \"Damn, if they take me to the hospital and my car is in this parking lot, how will I get to Milo,\" ... don't forget my agenda!!  :-)By the time Emergency came I could tell that I had managed to cough up the offending nut.  Fluid was still streaming from every orifice of my head, coughing/gagging was still  going on, but my breath was returning.  I still couldn't speak, but I could fill my lungs (and then try to cough one of them out onto the rug), but still!!Once I began to improve, I improved quickly.  I signed a release saying I refused to go to the hospital.  I was fine.  And I was.So I got the car title and tried to slink out of the lobby after thanking the bank manager.  And I drove out to Bethesda to get Milo.Upon returning home, I discovered mom couldn't walk.  She said on a scale of 1 to 10 - with 10 being the worst pain ever - her pain when putting weight on her right leg was a 10.  Damn!!!I called the doctor again.   This day was defiantly not one of my better ones!Now it is 10:45 pm.  I sit in my mom's den waiting to hear if she needs help getting out of bed to urinate.  I am dead tired.  She is struggling with pain, but she has a pain patch on to help.  It probably will be a difficult night, but ...We are home ... for now.  Tomorrow will start with a 6:45 am visit from the doctor, maybe a trip by ambulance to radiology, maybe a trip to the ER ... but, for now, we are home.  I am glad!I am breathing pretty good, too!  :-)"},

{"title": "Stupid, Silly, Sad Sentimentality", "date": "Monday, October 17, 2011", "text": "My time with Maxine is growing shorter.My 2003 Maxima, Maxine, has been with me since late 2002.  I have been her driver all that time, and we have had some wonderful experiences together.  I know it is silly, stupid and sad to apply sentimentality to an intimate object.  But I seem to do it with cars.She is an old girl now, her paint job is marked with dings and scratches, her headlights look yellowish rather than clear (do cars get cataracts?), and her interior speaks volumes of the multiple trips where she carried my most precious cargo ... my grand-dogs.But she still can move like a youngster when I need her to.My favorite memory with Maxine occurred early on in our relationship.  On the way home from work one evening traffic was horrendous.  Coming around the merge ramp to the high speed highway I was appalled by the volume of traffic and the speed it was moving ... fast!  And then I saw it, a small break in the line of cars.  I assessed the possibilities and applied the gas ... and the young Maxine took off like a shot!!  We were at speed in no time and we slipped easily into the space.  I remember the glow I felt at that moment.  I remember patting the steering wheel and saying \"fabulous, great job, Maxine you are the best.\"  So thrilled with her performance, I shared the story with my husband when I got home.  His response: \"Do you know how much gas you use when you do that?\"  Guess you can figure out which one of us is the adult in this relationship.There are many more experiences that bonded me to this car.  And the love affair continued over all these years.  I overlooked a lot in the last 12 months:  the fact she took only premium gas, that she needed high performance tires because she was considered a high performance car, that she didn't handle all that well in snow, that her miles per gallon has slipped considerably, that the driver's side window sometimes wouldn't stay up, that her CD player was starting to skip, that her repairs were starting to get expensive (we just replaced her front tires and she had a $1500 struts replacement just recently.)  Yes, I have overlooked a lot.  Love is like that.  But now she is burning oil - about a quart per 1000 miles.  My husband has reached the tipping point on this car and I guess I have too.Today we took her in to our mechanic of over 25 years - just to re-check the oil - just to be sure the fact she was 2 quarts down a month ago wasn't an anomaly.  She was down another quart. They had looked for a leak and couldn't find one.  As my husband and I walked out I could feel the tears streaming down my face.  I wasn't ready to give this car up.Stupid, silly and sad sentimentality!Another car is in our near future.  I won't be giving it a name.  I won't be getting attached to it, either.  I won't, I won't, I won't.I already have enough legitimate sadness in my life without finding ways to be sad about inanimate objects.  But I am going to miss this car big time.AND I hate car show rooms and car sales people.  I am sure they are nice people with families and all, but I hate the bargaining game and the \"let's make a deal\" attitude.

{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - Isolation", "date": "Monday, October 17, 2011", "text": "There are a few emotions related to care giving that I never anticipated. And some of these emotions have changed who I am as a person.One is social isolation.The short version is this: as the elderly person's scope narrows, the care giver's scope can also narrow.  As I mentioned previously, it is not uncommon to find the social connections, hobbies, physical abilities and health of the elderly narrow resulting in a very home bound life.  Sometimes keeping up socially is \"just too much trouble\" for the elderly.   And if this happens it can impact the care giver as well.I have been a social person most of my life.  Projecting my life into my retirement ... I anticipated many things that would keep me outside the home.  I was never one to gain energy from being at home or time alone.  For example, here are activities I could joyfully predict would fill my life with if there were no constraints.Tai ChiKnitting Groups (I attend only one - there are three.)Book Discussion GroupsExercise - walking, Curves, YogaVisiting friendsArt classes at the local community collegeDay tripsVacations and TravelCat and Dog ShowsCrafts and Craft ShowsVolunteer activities at local animal shelters or wild life centerShoppingLight hikingDog park visits with my grand babiesBeach trips with friendsMoviesExhibits - live in the Washington Baltimore corridor - there is a lot to doIf you examine this partial list carefully, most take place outside the home.   My reality now is that being \"around the house\" is necessary if you want to know what is going on and to assist with certain tasks.  Being \"around\" is what Mom seems to need as well.  When I am gone, she \"forgets\" where I am, she frets, she waits, she worries ...So I have tried to find ways to develop pastimes and hobbies that keep me at home, but keep me isolated.  They all tended to be the kinds of activities that would appeal to a hermit, not a social butterfly.  My activities look alot like this ...Knitting, weaving, spinningBloggingIpad gamesPod CastsReading - Audio booksTVDog sittingHouse keeping - DeclutteringInviting friends to our houseI enjoy these all activities, but the list is much shorter, and it is more solitary.  I have managed to hold onto my Tuesday morning knitting group time away from the house.  But knitting group is a single social event in a great waste land of solitary activities.Despite everything I have said to this point, I am NEVER really alone. Mom, my husband, my kids, my granddogs ... they pretty much fill my life.  I am grateful for them.  But I have grown to greatly value my alone time.  For example, driving to pick up my grand dogs is one such alone activity I truly enjoy.  Just me with my thoughts (and thousands of Washington Baltimore drivers - but they don't count.)  When Mom asks if she can go with me, I usually tell her no.  I feel bad because she could use some time out of the house as well, but I need that time for me.  My walks (infrequent as of late) are another alone time that I cherish.   I used to enjoy walking with my husband.  Now walking alone is more satisfying.  Crazy as it sounds, if I could take a week's vacation by my self - I would be in heaven.  Some solitary activities are desired, others are not. The person writing this blog post today is very different the person who started on the care giving journey 5 years ago.  I am a person with limited ability and energy to give.  I used to think there was no bottom to my giving nature.  There is.  I value my alone time more now than I ever did before.  I find my alone time to be a precious commodity.  I am a person who experienced great disappointment and loss in this journey and it has changed me.  Solitary time is sometimes more rewarding than all the social and familial activities that I once enjoyed. Contractions?  Maybe.  It all comes down to an isolation that I didn't seek out but accept as part of my role - my care giver role.  Someday that role will disappear.  It will be interesting to see if the current changes to my nature, my personality, remain.  I believe that some life experiences mark you, change you, permanently.I feel changed."},

{"title": "Rainy Ride", "date": "Thursday, October 13, 2011", "text": "Today was Thursday!  Thursday is the day I drive into Bethesda to pick up Milo.  Come with me on my trip!Although it was rainy, the first part of the trip down Route 95 was pretty tame.  But this was just the first 5 minutes.  This weekly trip can take the normal 30 minutes or it can take 2 1/2 hours ... one way!  Don't move to the Washington DC area unless you can tolerate traffic.Of course, I generally have a reward built into the beginning of the trip.A Frappe Mocka with an extra shot of expresso.  Whip cream and a cherry on the top, frosty ice cream with chocolate and coffee flavors.  Yumm ...  It is 8 points on my diet, but worth every point.  And I count it as lunch since I am not hungry after drinking it.However, this is probably my last one. The last few have upset my stomach a bit - having problems with GI regurg and this treat seems to set off gas symptoms.  Boo.As I approached the Washington Beltway the traffic picked up.  So typical. But the back up is moving.  I am always surprised when I can make this trip without a back up.  Of course with rain, you can almost count on traffic delays.Soon the traffic breaks up on the Beltway, but if you look to the left, it is a \"parking lot\" on the other side of the road.Oh well.  Maybe it will be gone when I make the return trip. (HA!)  If not, I am prepared.Yes, knitting!! In fact, my husband suggested I bring a bed roll!  Maybe a tooth brush and tooth paste.  LOL  I will have my knitting and my Milo so I will be happy.Finally!  Milo's home.  And look who is waiting!Bet his mom told him that his Grandma was coming.Smiling?  Yes, I think so.Ready to get in the car!  \"Hey look everyone, I am going to Grandma's.\"The traffic did not disappoint!  A bear of a trip back to Grandma's.\"But I am with Grandma, so who cares.\"\"Ah, Grandma, who is driving the car if one hand is one me and one hand is on the camera?\"Dear Milo. that is what knees are for.(Actually we were stopped ... really.)Almost home - thankfully!  Love the fall colors even in the dismal weather.\"I think we are here!!\"\"Grandma, we are here, right?  I think I see Blitz, my friend.\"Another safe trip to Bethesda and back under our belts!!Besides the fun projects in previous posts, my days were filled with dog sitting, vet visits for sick dogs, and dinner company.  I most definitely was not idle during the blogging break.I have been almost daily blogger since I began writing in July 2010.  And I have loved every moment.  The brainstorming of ideas, the writing of postings, getting the pictures, launching and reading the comments ... all great fun. And the social and emotional needs that lead me to blogging were met. Blogging, however, is very time consuming.  I don't know how others write, but for me it is a multi-step process.  It goes something like this:Ah - a possible idea idea!Drop the idea in a draft post.Write free form whatever my fingers and brain decide.Read it - it is crap ... what were my brain and fingers thinking?Re-write.Read again.Edit, edit, edit.Take picturesOrganize and name pictures on my computer.Upload.Edit some more.Pick a date and \"Publish.\"Edit daily until the publish date arrives (shouldn't be necessary but I still find ways to simplify, correct, fix grammar ...  right up to the end).I knew blogging was time-consuming, but when I took a break, I became so productive in the house with other stuff, I was a bit embarrassed by the time I had spent on the computer.So the long and short of this posting is that my blogging schedule will slow a bit.  I can't spend so much time on the computer.I know that most successful blogs publish everyday, sometimes several times a day.  I will try to blog 4 times a week.  We will see how that goes.  And maybe I will have time to catch up on reading all your blogs as well.Cheers!"},
{"title": "The Cassidy", "date": "Wednesday, October 12, 2011", "text": "One other knitting project has been started while I was on a blogging break.I usually don't have 2 sweaters on the needles on the same time, but I had a bit of \"start-itis\" and felt the need to cast on a few big projects.I have waited a long time to start this particular sweater so I put it on the needles as soon as possible.This lovely hoodie, The Cassidy, has been on my to-do list for probably 3 years.  I love to knit cables and this one has a bunch.  But the cables are described as low bulk cabling - or cables that lie very flat to the body and as such, do not add bulk to the wearer (always a good thing.)I am not far along but I am past the \"dangerous periods\" for others nearby ... the rest should be smooth sailing.This yarn is called Mas Acero.  It is 60% wool, 24% silk and 16% viscose.  It comes from Brooke's Farm in Lancaster, Texas.  Brooke's Farm is one of my \"absolutely must go to and buy from vendors\" at the Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival.  If I have any money  left after visiting them, I shop with others.Believe it or not, this yarn is red - my display shows it as orange - a nice orange, but not the actual color.The yarn has a light feel to the hand and wonderful drape.  I have had this yarn about 3 years as well.I started the Cassidy after I started other projects.  Casting on went very smoothly.  Minimal swearing.  No one needed to leave the room.  No ripping out.  No wine.  Big improvement really.Knitting, it is just like riding a bike ... only with swearing.:-)"},
{"title": "Progress ... of a kind", "date": "Tuesday, October 11, 2011", "text": "This is my favorite yarn of all time.It has been discontinued by Classic Elite and is now  on clearance at Webs.  I am soooo sad it is going away for good, but happy to finally get some on almost 50% off.   This color is called Azalea.  Isn't beautiful?  I have had this yarn for only about 3 weeks and it already has an extensive history with me.I cast on for a sweater after a whole day of trying to get the correct gauge in multiple swatches. Knitted from the hem up, the sweater is constructed in one piece, so it began with a few hundred stitches.  I can't tell you how many times I counted and counted and counted to get the number exactly right.  It was a struggle for some darn reason.  I didn't think counting could be so tough. Finally the count was right.This is the sweater I was working on.  Yes, \"was\".The first 6 rows were a breeze - then the problems began.  Do the cable set up row, get the stitch markers in place correctly, count stitches ... count is wrong ... take the stitch markers out, replace the markers, count again ... wrong again, (swear) ... take them out again, count, add a stitch or two to get the count right, add the markers ... count ... WRONG AGAIN!! (Swear loudly)(Husband innocently comments out loud how much fun I appear to be having!)It is so long since he has seen me knit anything complicated, he forgets that there is a danger period for by-standers.  I glare.He remembers.He retreats!Then I finally get the count right.  I read the stitch instructions, I knit a whole row.  I knit it WRONG!!!Clearly ... I am out of practice at this knitting thing.  Guess I am now just a \"knitter\", and not a \"Knitter\"!!I unknit several hundred stitches (several hundred frick'en stitches) - using swear words that I haven't used for 18 months.  Husband is no where to be seen.Finally I get it right.I knit about 4 inches of this sweater (one heck of a lot of knitting).  I look at my work. Everything looks right ... except ... I decide I don't like the match of this yarn to this pattern. I just don't like it. I set the project aside.I go to the kitchen. I pour myself some wine.I take a big gulp.I go back.I look again. Nope!It has to go.Another big gulp of wine!!I rip out all 4 inches.  I wasn't using this \"favored of all yarns\" on the wrong pattern.But I was not deterred!I found 4 other possible patterns. But this time I already knew my gauge with this yarn and needles so I picked a pattern that matched that gauge.  Sort of a backwards process but no matter.Big smile on face! (the wine helped) I was knitting again.I cast on for a new sweater, called The February Lady Sweater.  This pattern begins at the neck and knits down to the hem (a top down sweater). I had decided to change the pattern a bit, but 4 inches into knitting the sweater I determined that I didn't like one of my changes.  !!!Damn!!! (Actually I am way past that word now ... I am on to bigger, better, more colorful swear words!)My husband is no where to be seen, and now my mom and the cats have left the room as well!Once AGAIN, I ripped it all out.What you are seeing is my third attempt with the yarn!  And I think I have it right this time.I think!Anyway, all these attempts have not dampened my love of this yarn or for knitting this sweater. The yarn is soft, beautifully dyed with slight tonal changes, and produces a beautiful fabric.The swearing and dangerous period for on-lookers has passed.The family and pets have returned to the room.The Knitter has also returned!:-)"},

I knew I had to do something different with the second one. Yes ... female.  Easier to add some bows and a ruffle, than to add gonads.And when I showed this pattern to the folks in my knitting group ... some said \"cool\".COOL??Really??While I was on knitting break did the martian pods come down to earth from outer space and inhabit every one's brains?  Or was everyone just so happy to see me knitting again.  They would have said \"cool\" to anything I knitted.(You wanted to see the stitches up close, right?)For years I have waited for my son to say, \"Mom, can you make me a sweater, or a pair of socks, or a scarf.\"  Years, I tell you.  And when he finally forms the words in his mouth ... \"Mom, can you make me a ...\"He finishes the sentence with ...\"Brain Slug\"Really?*sigh*Do you think this is a test?

{"title": "I am Knitter!", "date": "Sunday, October 9, 2011", "text": "I am a knitter!(Let me say this again,with feeling,stamping feet on the ground, slamming fist on the table, raising voice loudly)I Am A Knitter! ... there, that is better..... that kind of knitter.At least until 18 months ago! Since beginning knitting (1997), my most productive knitting year ever was 2009!  It was \"The Year of Me!\" Everything I knit was for me.  I completed about 9 projects that year - 4 of them sweaters.  That was the year when I told my knitting group they could also knit all their projects for me, too.  :-)... ahh, they were kind, smiled, ... they are such a tolerant group!But the period of the \"great unravel\" started in January 2010.  Little to no knitting.  No problem, I said to myself.  Everyone is off their game at some point.  But \"off game\" extended into June 2011.The \"why\" of this knitting wasteland escapes me. Yes, I know,  stress has been a constant companion in the last year, but normal knitters turn to their knitting to relieve stress and to settle their minds. Knitting is a calming, mediative practice.  Knitting relaxes. Knitting distracts you from stressors.  Well, not for me.  So something was serious out of whack.Time to cure myself.  And it has been a struggle.First I tried other distractions thinking I could jump-start my crafting life again.  I have tried my hand a spinning and weaving.  Loved both.  But ...This summer I literally forced myself to sit down and pick up knitting needles.  I started and completed a few simple projects.  Mostly hand towels and face clothes.  No complicated stitches, no patterns.  I could feel my normal self returning.This partial sweater, that I had about 5 additional inches on,  I frogged (ripped out the yarn).  I stopped knitting that sweater about 12 months ago, and I had lost my mojo for that project. Beautiful, yes, but it wasn't the right yarn for the pattern, it required too much thinking, it was too big for my shrinking figure ... it had to go.I finished up a pair of simple green socks I started in January 2010! Finally I was up to date.  Time to look forward and cast on.Tomorrow!New stuff on the needles.  New yarns.  New projects."},

{"title": "What was I doing?", "date": "Friday, October 7, 2011", "text": "Well, I survived my blogging break.I really didn't think I would be faithful about taking a break.The first few days were tough.  But then life filled the void - and for a change it wasn't filled with any illnesses or trips to the hospital with mom.First, it began with the vertical blinds that cover the kitchen slider.  The top cap spontaneously fell to the floor missing me by inches.  Just popped off - weirdest thing.  In fact, the blinds began to fail weeks ago when they wouldn't close or open without muscle.  These are the new ones.The kitchen door slider was not to be outdone.  While measuring for the new binds, I noticed the frame of the glass was bent in the slider.  The door has been hard to close for months.  Guess the frame was bent from all the effort. Time to replace this old door of about 20 years.  This is the new door.Then I noticed that the white wood interior frame they put in around the slider was essentially unfinished!  We didn't have any paint from the original paint job in the kitchen (from probably 15 years ago).  So I purchased a lovely green color called Dusty Leaf that I thought we would use in the future and painted the frame.Then I realized that it doesn't take a gallon to paint the frame, so I started painting a few other surfaces that were just a total mess.  We desperately need to paint the whole interior, but a few kitchen surfaces might spruce up the look until I can forced myself to experience such a disruptive activity.  Have I told you how much I hate painting?But I did this.And this.But truthfully, we need to paint because the other old paint surfaces look so sad next to the freshly painted ones.I am sure you can see how this is developing ... and I know that NO ONE is surprised.When I bought the paint I also picked up color swatches of a companion color called Lush Shade.  It is an off white with a hint of green in the same color way as Dusty Leaf.  Next week - a trip to Lowe's is on my agenda.  I may as well pick up some caulk so I can repair the fine cracks between the wall and the counter.And while I am there I might casually check out the materials for new counters, 'cause once I paint the walls, I am sure the counters will start screaming about how pissy they look!*sigh*And still, I will not do more than a few painted surfaces!  :-)That statement is a true one - because this old body can't do even this little bit of painting without complaining loudly each morning.  I do love the new look of the kitchen.  The all white appliances and white counter look so much better against a darker color.  And the simple changes made things look a little cleaner and inviting.So that is one thing that has kept my fingers busy.I'll check in with some other projects that have filled my life during the break in a few days."},

{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - The End?", "date": "Thursday, September 15, 2011", "text": "God grant me the courage not to give up what I think is right, even when I think it is hopeless.Chester W. NimitzFleet Admiral Chester Nimitz led the Allied Forces to Victory in the Pacific in World War IIWhen I first saw this quote it resonated with me.  So many elements of the care giving life can seem hopeless.  It can be very easy to just give up. After all, care giving cannot create good health, prevent disability or death.  As they say, no one gets out of this life, alive! But it can provide a safety net, an improved quality of life and a dignity in aging for someone you love.   It may seem hopeless if you see only the downward spiral, but care giving ... it is the right thing to do. Sharing my life as a care giver in my blog began as a fleeting thought.  The idea popped into my head in a nano second and took root.  I couldn't seem to shake it. Draft postings began to tumble out of me ... like a dam with a small unchecked leak that grows and grows until there is a flood.Still, I held off publishing that first posting.  I held off for a long time. Who would be interested in the ramblings of a daughter doing what millions of other people have done before ... caring for an aging relative. There is nothing unique about my story.  What value did it have except to me?And still I continued to write and write and write ... drafts only.  But the idea of publishing the posts grew just as the idea of writing my story had grown.  It felt like this idea was taking on a life of its own.  As the drafts evolved, I knew I would publish something to my blog at some point.  I finally published my first post with the thought that this writing was for me!  The post would have an audience of one.  Maybe a few family members might be interested. But the goal was to write for me.  So I turned off the comments option. Soon I was getting private emails from others who saw themselves in my story and felt compelled to respond in the only way I allowed ... by personal email. The emails expressed a kind of kinship with my life. Some comments were so descriptive that I began to wonder if they, too, had a \"leaky dam\" that needed a little release.  I began to understand that the barrier of \"no comments\" was unnecessary.  Readers wanted to share.  So I put the comments function back on the posts.Well, it is all out.  The good and the bad.Is this the end?  Hardly. I am still care giving.  I am still living each and every day with my aging mother.This blog started with a theme provided by Mark Twain. \"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do ...\"The quote, in its unedited form, references bold thinking and actions:  \"explore, dream, discover.\"  I see my life right now as less than bold, but the quote is still valid.  When all is said and done ... I will not be disappointed by the time I have devoted from my life in caring for my mother.   I guess the flood of thoughts and words on this topic will slow a bit now.  I have exhausted many of the backed up emotions and observations. The dam is no longer at flood stage.  I am content to write on care giver things as they evolve.I want to thank all of you who followed this story and provided so many thoughtful comments both on the blog, in person,  and through private emails.  Many of you shared your own care giving  experiences.  It has been an honor for me to have such wonderful readers.I need to send a very grateful \"thank you\" to two blogging friends who invited me into their blogs and introduced me to their readers.  Doris, from Hold My Hand, is a nursing home social worker. She professionally understood as well as any care giver the life experiences and emotions I shared.  Her recognition helped me understand the value of my experience for anyone walking this road with an elderly parent. It was also my first \"guest post\" on another person's blog.  Thank you, Doris.Another long time reader, Delores, from The Feathered Nest asked if she could introduce me to her readers through a post on her blog.  I was touched and felt honored to be the topic of one of her posts.  Delores, with her supportive comments and gentle wit, was a constant companion for me as I told this story.  Thank you, Delores. This writing has given me some clarity and peace.  So much of what I did over the last 5 years was reactive to life as I lived it.  There was no plan, no method, no agenda.  I responded from my gut.  I did what I thought was right at the moment without giving it too much analysis.  Now looking back - seeing the path I took without thinking - I see that my gut was right. Thankfully, I listened to my gut more than I listened to others.  I think it worked out.   At least so far.And I am also glad I finally listened to the mustard seed growing in me and started to write about this experience.  These days are a bit lighter for me now that I have remembered ... and shared.Finally to my mother.  Much is made of a woman's pain and struggle to give birth.  But I sincerely believe that the real struggle comes after birthing.   Molding a child into a normal functioning human while living a very difficult personal life is the best gift a mother can give her child. Thanks, mom.Retired knitterCare Giver and Daughter"},
{"title": "\"Sanity Group\" - more than just talk", "date": "Wednesday, September 14, 2011", "text": "Every Tuesday morning I go to my \"Sanity Group!\"  Well, that is what I call it.  Everyone else calls it The Columbia Sip and Knit: Tuesday Morning Knitting Group!These lovely people keep me connected, grounded, focused ... they really should charge for it!      :-)Here are some FOs (Finished Objects for those poor souls who have not discovered the joys of knitting, crocheting, and weaving).  Every single Tuesday, someone has finished something!!   This gorgeous sky blue tunic top is an eye-catcher for sure.   We all were impressed with the beauty of the work and the style. Let me say something about this beautiful blanket.The technique used in this project is called double knitting.  For those who are non-knitters, this technique produces a fabric that is two sided with colors reverse on the opposite side.While this technique doesn't sound like such a big deal, let me assure you ... IT IS!I have been a knitter for 14 years, and I haven't been able to successfully produce a pot holder using this technique. So you can be sure that a whole blanket is way beyond my skill level.Thankfully my self-esteme can survive this inadequacy.I think!This same knitter finished a beautiful sweater just recently.She just seems to pump these project out.Maybe now is a good time to  mention that I finished a pair of socks that I started in January 2010 ... finished them just last week. Yeah, me!Ok ...forget I said anything.  Here is another beautiful sweater completed by different knitter.  It also took her less time to make this whole sweater than it took me to make two small socks.  *sigh*What is hard to see in my picture is that this yarn has a bit of sparkle to it.  Very appealing.We don't limit ourselves to just knitting.Here is a project called pin weaving.  This technique produces a textured picture from the use of different kinds of yarns.  In the picture on the left you can see each individual pin used to anchor the yarns used.  I usually try to post finished objects only, but this project was so unusual and beautiful, I wanted to share to the process.This stunning scarf was a perfect match for clothes I was wearing that day.  I couldn't seem to separate the scarf from its creator based on that reason alone.Go figure!And this blanket is not only striking in its color and design ... it is massive!  A very impressive piece of work, indeed.  My socks are ... Oh forget it.  My socks can't hold a candle to something this large!!!So some of you may be wondering why my knitted socks are not part of this array of finished objects.  ... let see, well I guess ...or maybe, ahh, ... give me just a minute, I am sure I can come up with a believable lie ... Ok, ok.  I'll take a picture and post it soon ... promise!  After all, I am sure I hold the record for taking the longest period of time to complete the shortest project!!"},
{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - The Future", "date": "Tuesday, September 13, 2011", "text": "A scary place, the future.For mom the path she seems to be following is predictable ... new medical problems, more disability, less mental engagement, more hands-on care.During her last hospitalization and rehab, she slipped quite a bit. I worried that she had passed some invisible line that required more professional care than I could provide at home.  But I resisted because in my mind we were still dealing with an illness. You get better from an illness. You may still have chronic medical conditions, but you can recover from the episodic illness that made you weak, and you get well enough to do the things you once could.  And she did improve some.But questions still remain.  Will mom's future hold an assisted living or a nursing home? Will her health continue to hold stable or will she slide further downward?  How long can we manage her needs in our home?  These issues seem to glide one into the other in a massive gray way.  There never seems to be a definitive line in the sand that says ... \"Now we must take this next step.\"I worry about the impact of mom's future on myself.  How long can I physically continue to manage her declining condition?  Will I be able to separate her needs adequately from my own?  Could I survive my internal turmoil of placing her in another living environment that is not my home?  The final assault will be her death.  I can't imagine her absence from my life after 64 years.  I can't begin to fathom the size of the void that will be left by her passing.  I have read there is a relief and a kind of freedom at this passing. But do those feelings balance the loss and the void her death will cause in my life?  Will I ever be normal again or will I have to search for a \"new normal\" for my own life?And what of my own aging?  I watch her struggle and I think ... you are looking at yourself 20-30 years into the future. Where will I be physically and mentally at 85? I know that some of mom's condition is the result of her personal choices over the last 20 years.  But the aging process is not easy for some and hard for others.  The aging process is hard for everyone no matter what you do to prevent it. Yes, the future is a scary place.Retired KnitterCare Giver and Daughter"},
{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - Faith", "date": "Monday, September 12, 2011", "text": "I avoid talking about religion and politics.  Both topics are polarizing.  People typically have strong views about both, and those views are not generally changed by discussion.But I have touched on the topic of faith in my care giving series. Maybe a few more comments now won't hurt.I was raised a practicing Catholic.  I owe a great deal of my good education to the Catholic Nuns who were my teachers from grades 1 to 8.  And I believe my morality and views on life can be traced back to my religious upbringing.As an adult, I like to think of myself as a good person, treating others as I would like to be treated, finding the good in everyone, keeping an open mind regarding others ideas and positions ... and I still believe there is a God.  But I am not as comfortable with an organized religion as I was in my youth.  In fact, against some of the precepts of my religious education, I do not believe that any one religion has the total attention of God to the exclusion of everyone else.Mom still is a strong traditional Catholic. I take mom to Mass every Sunday.  Mom's faith is a vital part of who she is, and she has many social contacts at church. She believes in all the traditions and the rituals.  She has lived her whole life never questioning anything about her religion.Looking back mom's relationship with her church and God, I can see how it sustained her.  Her favorite saint was always St. Jude, Patron Saint of Hopeless Causes. Hopeless Causes.  A sad indication of how she felt about her life for so long.I guess in the end St. Jude came through for her.  Dad died when mom was in her 40s.  After he was gone, she finally was able to build a good life for herself.  Work, travel, friends, hobbies - she finally a chance to live normally.  But 24 years is a long time to live with such unhappiness.  I often say, I wouldn't have put up with my dad, but put in her shoes with 2 young children, no job and no family support nearby ... who knows what I would have done.  Mom's faith was her lifeline, and St. Jude finally paid attention to her prayers.  I can't help but wonder if she was just waiting and waiting for some divine intervention.  Could things have been different if she took some kind of action. Still, 24 years ... \"hopeless causes\" ... makes me sad even to this day.I guess I am more of a questioner!  As an adult, when I thought about God, I didn't find comfort and answers in organized religion.  I believe that we all were created by God with intelligence, wit and strength, and we are expected to use those gifts as we live our lives.  To sit back and wait for Him to fix things is to ignore the tools He gave us to fix things ourselves.Still ... when I have lost strength and feel I can't take another step ... I turn to prayer.  So I do believe in God, the same God that mom believes in ... and I think He is fine with both our approaches.  I don't think He judges on how we believe, just as long as we believe.A well known poem called Footprints speaks most closely to how I felt this last year has been for me and my relationship with God.One night I had a dream--I dreamed I was walking along the beach with the Lord and across the sky flashed scenes from my life. For each scene I noticed two sets of footprints, one belonged to me and the other to the Lord. When the last scene of my life flashed before me, I looked back at the footprints in the sand.I noticed that many times along the path of my life, there was only one set of footprints.I also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times in my life. This really bothered me and I questioned the Lord about it. \"Lord, you said that once I decided to follow you, you would walk with me all the way, but I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my lifethere is only one set of footprints.\"\"I don't understand why in times when I needed you most, you should leave me.\" The Lord replied, \"My precious, precious child,I love you and I would never, never leave you during your times of trial and suffering. \"When you saw only one set of footprints,it was then that I carried you.\"Mary StevensonI guess I got carried a few times this year.Hope He doesn't forget where I live.  :-)Retired KnitterCare Giver and Daughter"},
{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes -  Help", "date": "Sunday, September 11, 2011", "text": "Getting help!I am not good at it.  Type A personalities typically aren't good at asking for help or delegating.And I have lived my life pretty much according to this quote:The best place to find a helping hand is at the end of your own arm.Swedish ProverbCare giving, however, teaches you the limits of your energy.  And no matter what your personality type, eventually, you find yourself in over your head.  For me it is a terrible position to be in ... to ask for help.  In fact, the last time I stretched to the breaking point, my husband insisted that I ask for help.And I did.But if you ask for help and you get resistance or excuses, it confirms that you shouldn't have asked in the first place.  If you ask for help and it is interpreted as a rescue from your decisions, that is deadly. So I rarely ask.The truth is that you cannot do this job alone.  Even in elder care institutions, they have 3 eight hour shifts of helping hands. Thankfully, I have a generous, loving and strong network.  To start with my husband, whose every day life was most affected by my choices, continues to support me.  I am sure when he said his vows 42 years ago, it didn't include living with his mother-in-law.  It is not his nature to be a care giver, and the frustrations of life for him are considerable at times.  But how do you project 42 years into the future what life will be like and what will be asked of you.  The fact he is still standing solidly by my side after 5 difficult years I guess means he really meant \"until death do us part.\"  How great is that!And my adult children have been a help beyond measure.  They don't wait to be asked.  They see a need and jump right in.  They really should be saving energy for their own parents 20 years from now ... meaning me, of course!   :-)  I plan to be a hand full when I am mom's age. I have already warned them.But seriously, my adult children have already shown sensitivity and commitment without my asking. They know first hand how hard this is for me at times.  I am proud to call them my kids.Then there are friends!  I won't name names, but they know who they are.  Two individuals readily come to mind because of recent events. There are others, but this blog can only hold so much.One friend is dealing with her own husband's critical and complex health issues, but she has walked this parent care giving path before me.  She has offer valuable insights by email time and time again. Never judgemental, she is supportive and caring to my thoughts and frustrations. She constantly reminds me how \"normal\" all my responses are - even the bad ones.  My knitting friend ... you are golden!  And then there is another good friend from my former professional life, who I recently saw after an absence.  I tried to pick her brain for home companion recommendations, since she too has been a care giver for her grandmother and husband. She responded so quickly to personally help, that I couldn't believe it: \"I would love to do this for you and your mom!\"  She remembered mom from years ago when mom went to doctor appointments independently.  This friend's generous and spontaneous offer had me in tears as I stood in her office.   She demanded that I stop or she would be in tears, too.  Mom remembers this lovely lady, and they spent their first afternoon together yesterday.  It went exceeding well from both of them.  Knowing that mom is in my friend's capable hands lifted about 10 pounds off my shoulders. Thank you my dear friend from the bottom of my heart. A few other resources  ...The website Caring.com has been most interesting and was discovered by my husband.  A recent story on Care Giver Stress and how to deal with it seemed timely.  There is also a free online newsletter.  It is amazing how many times I see myself in these articles.Another suggestion I have yet to seek out is a book called Caring For Mother: The Long Goodbye by Virginia Stem Owens.  I plan to order it - and review it for this series of posts at some future date. At times I feel I am living that title.I have also found some interesting pod casts on the subject of elder care.  Aging Parents Pod Cast can be found at iTunes and at their website Aging Parents.com.  I haven't really explored the web site, but I have listened to a number of the pod casts.  Five years ago I would have found this information very helpful.  I have learned a lot already through experience, but there is still new information to be found.  Of course, you have to read/listen critically and determine which information is valid for your situation.  Recently I discovered the large support system sitting out there for the asking  .... the blogging community. While it is true that bloggers are distant \"friends\", they have frequently boosted my mood and energy with words of encouragement and advice.  And the sharing of personal care giving experiences has been very touching.You guys are the best!In the end when all is said and done, I am the main support for mom ... she looks to me no matter what actions I take.  But \"help\" is critical to make sure I can still be standing for as long as she needs me.Retired KnitterCare Giver and Daughter"},
{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - Letting Go", "date": "Saturday, September 10, 2011", "text": "Five years ago, I started on this caregiver path just as enthusiastically as the crusaders did when marching to the Holy Lands hundreds of years ago.  Really, I know that statement sounds ridiculous, but, it is true.  I had energy and desire,  I figuratively fought a lot of battles since those early days, and I have been scarred and depleted by them.  Just like a crusader.And I have learned very important lessons that I would have thought impossible in the beginning.I pick battles carefully.I can't win them all.  Sometimes I  just have to \"let go\".Care giving is a marathon, not a sprint.  As mom's care required more of my time and energy I began to see the wisdom of picking my battles carefully.  Believe me, that was a very hard lesson to learn.  Type A personalities (like myself) hate to leave anything undone, or incomplete, or unresolved.  Some of the battles I continue to fight look a lot like this:\"Yes, you will start this antibiotic. I won't take no for an answer.\"\"We will get a stair lift.  My house, my stairs, my decision.\"\"You will go to the hospital because it isn't acceptable to sit here so short of breath and unable to walk.\"You get the picture.  Health and safety issues are my battle grounds.  Recently, however, I have taken a more back-seat approach to other lower priority activities.  I still believe these priorities are important. I used to fuss at her about doing them.  But out of respect for her and to allow some decision making over her own life, I have backed off - let go - on other stuff.The biggest \"letting go\" has been her physical activity.  This year it has dropped significantly.  After a spring hospital discharge, she exercised to get her strength back.  She walked every day.  She practiced climbing steps.  For months I had a schedule, and I made sure she did it all. She did improve greatly.  But lately she has backed off on being active.  If I don't remind her, she doesn't do it. She sits a lot.I have come to believe that there are some things in life you just have to want for yourself.  Keeping physically active is one of them.  Occasionally I remind her, like today, that if she doesn't keep active, she will get weak - too weak to live in a house with this many steps.  Sometimes that works and sometimes that doesn't.  But to spend both our lives pushing for an activity level that she is not personally committed to doing is not good for either of us.  So I remind her, but I do not badger her. I have let this battle go.Another \"letting go\" relates to mental stimulation.  She seems quite content to sit and do nothing.  When I began to see this trend toward mental idleness, it bothered me.  In checking with her doctor I learned that the need for mental stimulation reduces in some elderly.  I should not assume she is unhappy in her idleness. Sometimes I watch her sitting outside.  In the middle of the day there are no passing cars or people walking about.  Maybe there is a squirrel or two, but it is pretty quiet on my end of the street.  And still she seems content to look around and be with her thoughts.  I prompt her with puzzles and books, remind her of TV shows she enjoys, chores she needs to do. I suggest, but don't insist that she keep busy. Here is another battle I have let go.Several years ago I might have felt that \"letting go\" was just the same as \"giving up.\"  I would require that she continue to keep active mentally and physically.  She would agree and make an effort to do whatever I was suggesting.  But how much of that was my agenda being forced on her?  Understanding and accepting what mom seems to want for herself has been an evolution for me.  As I stand here in my 64 year old body, I know that I want more for myself.  More movement, more thinking, more productive activities, more of everything.  I believe in the \"use it or loose it\" way of thinking. But does that mean that my way is the only right way?  I think \"letting go\" of what I want is a way of respecting her choices - even if they aren't my choices.  Of course, I cannot ignore the fact that her choices will lead eventually to more disability.  Inactivity both physically and mentally will lead inevitably to more inactivity. It is a vicious circle.This, however, is her path to choose.  Sometimes I ponder what path I will choose when my body is not 64 but 84!  Will I be able to live up to my own standards?  How much of a crusader will I be for my own aging?Hard lessons, hard questions. Retired KnitterCare Giver and Daughter"},
{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - I am 12", "date": "Friday, September 9, 2011", "text": "Or maybe 13, but certainly not more than 14 ... in my mother's eyes.  This was a new development as of 5 years ago.Until mom's move into my home I was a \"married adult\" in her eyes.  I moved out of the status of a \"child\" at 22 years old on my wedding day.  It almost seemed as if on that day, she viewed me differently.  I was now independent.  My future was with another.  Her knowledge of my activities, my thoughts, and my goals became seriously limited.She had launched me into life on my own and then \"let go!\"Now I am not saying that she was a distant and uncaring person.  Not at all.  She always lived within a 30 minute drive, hosted family dinners, baby sat her grand children, called me to chat,  ... But she never inserted herself into my life.  If she made judgements about my actions she never shared them, never gave me advice unless I asked for it. None of that.  Our lives were now separate and she moved on with her life.  Of course, during my first year as a young married woman, she was still living with my dad.  His alcoholism was a daily cross she carried.  I also suspect that their own personal history as a young married couple impacted how they treated me.  Somehow I became aware that the move to Maryland so long ago was partly due to too much family in their lives.  Marriage seemed to be the dividing line in my mother's eyes for when you became an adult.  Getting engaged was the first step in that direction.  And that conversation rings clear in my mind as if it was yesterday. Mom and I were walking our dog, Lucky, in front of our house.  I turned to her and said, \"He has asked me to marry him, and I said yes.\"  There was no congratulatory comments, no expressions of love, no joyful response for my happiness.  She was quiet for a moment and then said:  \"You must be sure, because once you are married, I won't be able to help if things don't work out.\"  I was 20 at the time.  I remember feeling a sense of disappointment in her response.Looking back I can see this statement was a peek into her own past.  Things didn't work out very well for mom after she married, she didn't have any help from her family,  friends, or her church.  When she married, she was on her own.  If her married life had been different, would she have responded differently to me? Maybe.  I can't imagine ever saying those words to one my children.  I would extend a helping hand as long as there was breath in my body.  But my married experience was different from hers ... mine was normal.I know now she was dealing with a lot then. But at the time I was too young to be understanding or reflective.  I feel badly that I expected more.So as a married adult, she had a hands-off policy with me.  I was mature, someone's wife, and taking on adult roles.  She had done her job with her first child, and she moved on with her life.That all changed when she moved into our house five years ago.It is hard to step back into being a child when you have been an adult from age 22 to 59.  It is hard to accept direction on activities that you have been doing successfully for 37 years.  It is hard to respond in an adult fashion to questions that imply you may not be able to handle the everyday functions of your own life and household, even though you have done so without help ... did you lock your car?  don't forget to lock up the house when you go to bed? you will be home before dark - won't you? who called and what did they want? It is hard.And while I was being downgraded as an adult, my husband was reaching nose-bleed heights as an adult.  In my mom's world, women were secondary and subservient, men were important and in charge. It was her life experience and something she didn't outgrow as she matured.  It is an element of her personality that gets in the way daily for both of us.So now my husband was the adult in our house. And technically she probably thought of it as \"his\" house - not \"our\" house.  His opinion was very important.  His littlest actions were noticed, remarked on and thanked.  She seemed unaware that we were a couple who handled many of life tasks equally.  It was no matter that I did everything for her ... I was 14!I remember one birthday conversation that demonstrates this thinking better than any recitation of examples.  Mom used to take us out to dinner for our birthdays.  Every year, she would begin with date setting and then selecting a restaurant.  One year on my birthday she reminded me that we needed to set a date.  We did.  Then she asked me \"Where do you think Mike wants to go?\"  I paused, letting that statement hang in the air a bit.  Then I responded  ... \"Well, since it is my birthday, I don't care where he wants to go.\"  There was another pause while my response hung in the air.  Then she started to laugh a bit.  We both laughed, but it was how her mind worked.  In every situation, what did the man want to do?I do understand where her perception of life came from. But it was impossible for me to reject the whole of my adult life and step back into the 1950s role of a house wife.  As my age and equality dropped in her eyes, there was more friction between us.I have often remarked how it was that mom managed to raise 2 daughters who were so entirely different from herself in attitude and independence. Generational differences can put great pressures on parent-child relationships.  But, thankfully, over the 6 months I have seen her attitudes soften a bit.  The full impact of her health issues and physical limitations have made an impression.  She can't help but notice, that when life has covered her from head to foot in lemons ... I was the one continuously standing at her side batting those lemons away.  I  think she recognizes that now.  But old habits die hard.  It is still a constant battle.So let me revised my initial statement ...  today I think I have grown to about  ... oh, maybe 17!  If she could just think of meas an independent 28 or 29 year old ... I think that imagery could work for me:-)as long as I didn't look in the mirror!Retired KnitterCare Giver and Daughter"},
{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - Salt!", "date": "Wednesday, September 7, 2011", "text": "Mom emerged from her earlier hospitalizations with a few new diagnoses, new medications and dietary changes.\r... hmmm! \rBut I get ahead of myself!!\rBack to the beginning ... way back.  Back before she moved in with me, before she retired, before I got married - back when mom cooked for her family.  \rAs my my son would say, \"back when dirt was invented!\"\rThere was no such thing as \"dietary restrictions.\"   If it tasted good, you ate it. Nothing was harmful or worrisome.  After all, cigarettes were recommend by doctors as a way to calm nerves.  Lard was commonly used.  A paternal uncle of mine was a butcher, and the story goes that my aunt baked with chicken fat.  She made to-die-for baked goods ... which my uncle did - die ... from a heart attack.  And salt was never a problem then.  \rWe were raised with salt.  \rTo this day, I still believe salt isn't a seasoning, but a food group.  Salt is a gift of the Gods!! \rNow fast forward a few years.\rSalt and I are still very good friends.  Even after all the negative publicity about salt and blood pressure, I still use salt. That why diuretics were invented, right?\rNow that I have set the stage ... I'll continue.\rFour years ago at mom's first hospital discharge,  the nurse gave her instructions: low salt and low fat diet. I stopped the nurse in her recitation.  I informed her that mom lived with me, that she had made it to the great age of 81 (at that point), and that as far as I was concerned, she could eat whatever she wanted.  The nurse smiled at me and graciously agreed ... but she had to document in the chart that she had said these words: \"low salt and low fat diet\".\rOk, I didn't want to get in the way of someone doing their job.\rSo mom and I continued blissfully down the old salt road.  Every hospital discharge included the same cautions - \"low salt and low fat diet\".  \rAnd then April 2011 came.  She got short of breath.\rWe didn't realize what was causing it.  We went to the ER.  Tests were performed, and we waited for results.  While we waited, mom and I were hungry.  It was right before lunch. They don't serve lunch in the ER.  I went out to the snack machine in the lobby - salty and sweet were all they had.  If they had carrots and celery I would have ... well, no, you wouldn't believe that.\rI got Doritos!\r(Stop it!  I can see you shaking your head.)  :-)\rWe munched together.  Those Doritos were so yummy. We each had our own bag.  I am sure I licked my fingers.  We finished every last piece.  I \"shot a few baskets\" with the Doritos bags in the trash.\rWe waited some more for test results.\rThen the doctor arrived with the diagnosis.  She had fluid around her lungs, and that was why she was short of breath.  They would start her on IV diuretics right away and admit her to the hospital. \r And then he asked about her diet and salt!\rThe crumpled Doritos bags stared back at me from the trash can.  I closed my eyes.  Then I looked back at the trash, willing those bags to be somewhere else.  Then I looked at mom.  She had not put two and two together.  Those yummy Doritos had to be 85% salt.  Thankfully she did not rat me out to the doctor, and the doctor didn't look into the trash!\rShe had fluid retention.  It hospitalized her. Salt was hurting her now.  Mom's health required less salt.  Mom and salt must part ways.\rLike a fictional cartoon character, I responded heroically!  \rI became \"The Terminator\" of salt, Wonder Woman of the no salt diet, Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau of food labels. If it went in her mouth, I examined it.  I would be the best no-salt daughter ever.  In short, salt was now mom's enemy and therefore my enemy (on her behalf only, 'cause I was still a closet-salt-eater!)\rWe proceeded salt free for about 2 months.  I bought low salt and no salt versions of all her favorites.  I adjusted my recipes.  She unenthusiastically ate what I gave her, but she complied ... at least while I was watching.\rOne day she snagged one of those big fat sour dough pretzels with the big chunky pieces of salt.  She did not see me, but I watched her. You could see the pure joy of her tongue reflected on her face.  Guilt!  I had kept her from that.  Best intentions, but still ...\rSo I packed away my \"Super Daughter\" hero cape, and I added salt sparing into her diet, permitted a salty item now and then, watched her weight, her blood pressure, checked her ankles, made sure medical professionals were listening to her lungs ...  \rBut she got salt back in her diet again!\rLife is too short to cut out all simple pleasures.

If you stood still long enough, you would be marked by his ever full bladder.  I once apologized to a little girl's mother for Grimmy doing exactly that to her child.I still remember Grimace's look when I scolded him. \"Really, Gram, she was sitting there so quietly.

He was 3 years old when my son adopted him from Pug Rescue.  The little we know of his background goes like this: he and his brother were having problems getting along, the couple that owned them were expecting a baby, and they decided to give up both dogs.  \rGrimace is not complicated.  He lives his life by two simple principles:Be devoted.   And he is.  We joke that Grimmy thinks that I own him and he just visits with his papa.

Every sleep over night, Grimace and Grandma go for a long morning walk together.  Sometimes Milo comes, but on this day it was just Grimmy and Gram (\"the way it is meant to be\" says Grimmy).\rOn morning walks Grimace gets to chose the direction. He is in charge.  Which way to go?  Which way to go?\rSo here we are checking out this tree.\rAnd this tree.\rAnd this tree.\rI swear they are different trees.  They may look exactly the same to you, but if you had a dog's nose, you would know they are as different as horses and pumpkins.\rWe are lucky to have a small park near by.  The entrance is a stopping place for all the dogs of the neighborhood.  Walking by this fence without stopping to sniff would be like taking this 40 minute walk without breathing. Impossible.\r\"Grandma, I love our morning walks.\"Sometimes I make him stop for a rest.  He is getting up in years.  Look at the dear gray face.Even the tips of his ears are gray.  It makes me sad because it reminds me that our years together are becoming shorter!\rTime to be moving on.\rUsually the walk back up the stairs to the house is a slow climb.\rAnd getting back in the house for a drink, breakfast, and some couch time is a priority.

{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - Joy", "date": "Monday, September 5, 2011", "text": "(Continued )\rAlthough it might not seem so, we had many joyful moments.  Maybe these little jewels were more brilliant because the time surrounding them was so hard.  Like stars in the massive night sky - those joy filled times were intensely bright.\rHer discharge from the last hospitalization in December was one such dark and brilliant time.  I blogged about some of this in December 2010. (Posting Title: That which does not kill you.)  \rTwo hospitalizations nearly back to back during December had seriously compromised her strength.  Coming home was impossible at that point, but I avoided thinking beyond the hospital walls.  When the social worker approached us at the end of the second hospitalization, she launched into her regular speech recited hundreds of times before: prepare a list of 3 nursing facilities,prepare this list very soon since discharge can happen quickly, visit the facilities first before making decisions,do not delay!Handing me the list of local facilities, she finally looked at me.  I think my face told the story.  I was desperately tired, worried, and anxious, and I knew mom wanted to go home.  I wanted her to go home.  I knew she couldn't. I stared at the list.  I would have to explain why she couldn't go home after the social worker left.   And I had to be able to do this without letting mom see how upset and sick I was at the thought of taking her to a nursing home for rehab.\rThe social worker immediately took a softer, more interested attitude, but soon left.  It was 4:00 in the afternoon. Time was short.  I needed to leave right away to see some of these places.  \rFacing mom to explain the situation was the hardest thing I have ever done!  Until that moment I had never prayed for strength.  I always found it within me.  Always.  But in that moment, looking into mom's disappointed eyes, I made a silent prayer. \rI hoped someone was listening.\rShe took the news as well as could be expected. I promised her I would be back in time to spend the night.  I left with the list keeping my emotions in check until I reached my car.  It was a terrible feeling leaving her alone for the first time in all her hospitalizations ... alone with her thoughts and the uncertainty of what was happening next.\rI can't even imagine what she thought about while I was gone.  Mom fears nursing homes.  I knew this.  I consistently used the label \"rehab center\" rather than nursing home.  She never caught on to the difference.  And maybe there wasn't a difference in her mind.  When nurses would do their routine mental awareness checks - one of the questions they ask is - Do you know where you are?  Sometimes mom would answer - in my daughter's home.  Sometimes she would answer - in a nursing home.  Those were the only two realities she had - and she didn't want to be in a nursing home.  Unfortunately in our area, rehab took place in nursing homes ... and that is where I was going to place her.  My heart was desperately heavy.\rThe ride home was hard.  Crying and driving is not safe.  I called my husband and explained why I was coming home.  Would he please come with me tonight to see these nursing facilities because I sincerely didn't think I could do this alone.\rNow I know it sounds odd ... most normal marriages you wouldn't have to ask.  It would be assumed.  But my husband has failing eye sight.  He seldom goes out after dark because his night vision is so very poor.  It was December, and by 5:00 pm we would have darkness.  This would be hard for him.  He responded immediately - of course he would come!  I knew he would say yes, but I hated to ask.  I wanted to be able to do this on my own but I couldn't.  I hated putting my husband in the uncomfortable position of appearing disabled, but I had to.  After a month of terrible happenings, I discovered there was nothing left inside me.  I needed help!  \rWe selected several places, called for appointments and mapped out our route.  I will never forget how much better I felt with him beside me.  He did have problems each time we left the car and walked through the darkness to the entrances, but he was there - I could cope with this distasteful task, if he was there.\rThe nursing facilities we visited ranged from bad to acceptable. One place was so terrible that I thought about walking out without completing the tour.  But the good manners my mother had instilled in me prevailed, and we stayed.  I asked all my questions and acted as if nothing was wrong. We left as soon as possible.  As we were leaving that facility my husband jokingly said, \"So ... I guess this place isn't on your short list.\" There was no humor in my response.  \"This place is a big, fat NO.  It isn't on my short list for a dog.\"   Apparently I still did have some fight left in me - if you dig deep enough, it is there. But I was sad for the poor souls who were receiving care there.  I remember thinking, if this is my only choice, mom will be discharged to my home. I will figure out how to handle her debilitated condition then. \rI believe my silent prayer was heard because many times that evening, as we looked at places I didn't want to think about, I could feel strength returning. \rAfter the evening tours, I had 2 places selected, but I needed 3.  And truthfully, there was only one place where I could take mom and be able to sleep well at night myself.  \rI guess the prayer I uttered so silently earlier in the evening was still echoing in His ears.  My daughter called with a suggestion that I check out Brook Grove Retirement Community.  She knew from her own residents that Brook Grove was a highly regarded rehab facility.  I might have trouble getting mom placed there because they are always full. It was worth a try.\rThe next morning I visited this wonderful facility. After the tour I knew, this was the place. And not only did they have room for her, she got a private room! It was 10 days before Christmas, they had space!\rJoyful moments don't come any better.  \rI sat in Brooke Grove parking lot after my tour and called the hospital social worker with my choices - I gave her two.  I was ready for a fight about giving the third, but it never came.  Maybe she remembered me and took pity.  \rThen I called my daughter to thank her. As I was dialing her phone number I kept repeating over and over to myself ... do not cry, do not cry, do not cry! She wasn't available so I had to leave a message.  I breathed a small sigh of relief that I could talk to a machine.  I might be able to leave a message without tears. I got almost all the way through it when my voice broke.\rAt least this time, they were tears of joy - total, complete, utter joy.  \rAnd relief.\rI returned to the hospital that morning, and within hours Mom was discharged.  It was quick.  And she was transferred by ambulance that evening to Brooke Grove (my post and pictures of this lovely place).  \rMy son volunteered to spend the first night with his grandmother so that I could go home and get some sleep.  I will never forget his smiling face as he sprightly walked into his grandmother room at 9:30 pm.  His back pack was slung over his shoulder, he greeted his grandmother with, \"So Gram, I understand that you and I are going to have a sleep over together.\"  I was never prouder of the young man he had become.\rAnd my dear mother, who had been through hell and back that month, smiled back at him and said, \"I wouldn't tell too many of your friends about this sleep over in a nursing home with your Grandmother.\"  She apparently was not down yet!\rMy sister spent the second night with mom, and I spent the third.  I felt comfortable leaving her alone by the fourth night. I knew she wouldn't be disoriented waking in the middle of the night.  I knew she could call for help.  And most importantly, I knew the staff would be there.  She was in good hands.  \rShe recovered quickly and was home for Christmas.  It was an unusual Christmas for us.  She came home on December 23.  When she walked in the door, there was no decorated Christmas tree, no Christmas cookies, no presents wrapped, (some were not even purchased), but mom celebrated the holiday at home. My daughter came home and between us we got the tree up and pulled together a semblance of holiday cheer.  It was the best Christmas I can ever remember!\rThere have been other bright stars in my dark sky since that hard December, but this one has shown as brightly as the North Star.  In fact, it is my North Star, because nothing brought me so low or raised me so high since then.\rAnd I learned a lesson about prayer.\rRetired KnitterCare Giver and Daughter"},
{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - Low Moments", "date": "Sunday, September 4, 2011", "text": "If you have read from the beginning you may wonder  - how do you live this life?  How do you stay in control, calm, loving, show deliberate and compassionate understanding?\rWell ... I don't!!  Not by a long shot!\rI haven't shared all my failings and there have been a lot.   I have said things to mom in anger over the years that make me cringe. \rIn the last month I blew up at mom when she wouldn't take a medication.  I remember saying things that were true, but did not need to be said. I asked her to please leave the room because I was so upset.  Tears of frustration and anger were streaming down my face.  Later my husband came into the room and put his arm around my shoulders and said - \"That wasn't you talking.\" What a dear thing to say, but sadly,  it was me ... a side of me I am not proud of.  But his comment made me I realized I had stepped way over the line.  \rSome of mom's behaviors were probably normal for an aging brain, but absolutely drove me nuts!  Times when I couldn't stand to answer the same question I already answered 4 times. Time when she was upset that I didn't tell her some such thing, when I had told her several times.  Other times when she argued about a new aid to help her. Days when she always responded  \"What\" to every question requiring you to repeat it again!\rIt sounds ridiculously small. Unless you have lived that experience it is hard to understand.\rI am not proud of any of that.  My brain is still pretty normal.  Her brain is not.  I should be able to cope.  But there are times when I simply can not.\rI didn't save my bad behavior just for mom either.  One hospitalization I was brutal with hospital staff.  To deflect some of my admitted guilt for this,  I was tired, sick and exceedingly worried about mom. I understand myself better from some of these episodes.  You see, I learned that when my back is pushed against the wall, when I am very tired and I feel the stakes are high ... I am a very different person from the one who is writing these posts.\rNot a nice. Brutally honest. Direct. Rude.\rI think I am getting better at backing away from a situation that I suspect could become explosive for me.  Getting better, but not there yet.\rDecember 2010 holds my most embarrasing memories.  And yes, I will share one.  But if you are upset by talk of bodily functions, implied swearing, or rude behavior, please don't read further.  Intense and strong emotions and responses were involved. If I lived through that terrible time again, I would probably behave exactly the same way.  I would try to be better, but sometimes my objectivity gets twisted out of shape when it comes to mom.\rI'll understand if you want to skip past this next section.\r******\rOur family emerged from Thanksgiving very sick.  I fell to the virus quickly.  It laid me low for 3 days.  Mom got sick as I was beginning to recover. But she was dangerously sick for an 85 year old so we went to the ER after only 4 hours of dealing with it at home.  She was admitted to the hospital.  Medical science started the fight to stop the loss of fluids she was experiencing from both ends of her body.\rAt Day 3, during the doctor's regular visit, he began to talk about discharge, maybe even discharge that day.  I resisted immediately. The vomiting was gone.  The diarrhea wasn't.  When I pushed back a little, he responded with a doctorly  air of authority that \"some accidents were within the scope of normal for the elderly.\"  I couldn't believe it. This man was preaching to me about \"normal scope\" and \"some accidents\" ?!!?\rI began to see RED!  I quickly informed him that ...\r\"I had lived with 'some accidents' for a number of years. I know all about accidents.  But I was there in the middle of the night when she was sitting in a large pile of sh*t!  He wasn't! I was there watching while 2 skilled, efficient and practiced hospital staff took a full 30 minutes to clean up her and change her bedding.  I am not convinced that she hasn't given herself another infection from the loose stool she sat in last night and previously since she arrived in this hospital. You will not discharge her until  this problem is tackled.\"  \rMy anger and voice were rising as I spoke, and I was hitting my stride with this man.  The next sentences were on the tip of my tongue:\r\"What don't you understand about 'sitting in a pile of sh*t'? Didn't they cover 'pile of sh*t' in medical school?\" \rBelieve me when I say, I had lost all control. If I hadn't needed to take a breath, those last two sentences would have been said.\rSadly I still regret not getting a chance to deliver those last lines! I reallllly wanted to.  I am not proud that I feel this way, but they had fixed only half of mom's problem.  We hadn't come this far for them to discharge her ill.\rMaybe he sensed he was going to lose this argument, or maybe he was considering calling Psychiatry.  :-) I will never know!  \rHe interrupted my tirade, and said they would keep her another night giving her a dose of Immodium to see if that made a difference.  He left before I could say another word. \r(Wise man!)\rAnd Mom who had been laying in the bed quietly between us, turning her head from side to side as we \"discussed\" this, turned to me after he left and asked ... \r\"So am I going home?\" :-)\rI checked to see if she had batteries in her hearing aids!!\rThere is no doubt that the conversation with the doctor could have been handled a little bit better!  :-)  And while there is no excuse for bad behavior, I know in my heart I would do it exactly the same way if presented with the same situation.  Sometimes people don't hear unless you first get their attention!  I clearly had his attention.\rBut afterwards I felt let down, embarrassed and fatigued.  I did not see myself as some crazy woman, but that was how I behaved.\rThe next day she was well.  The Immodium did the trick.  She was discharged.\rBUT, 7 days later she was re-admitted to the hospital with the infection that I warned the doctor about in my tirade.  This time, however, the infection had spread into her blood stream.  She was very, very ill this time and spent time in Intensive Care.  We had the same doctor.  I was more rested so I was more civil, and he was more respectful because he remember me. :-)\rBut the back-to-back hospitalizations had seriously tested the limits of my energy. I thought I had reached critical low. \rSadly, I was not finished falling.  \rHitting rock bottom was soon to follow. (to be continued)\rRetired KnitterCare Giver and Daughter"},

{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - Others' Eyes", "date": "Friday, September 2, 2011", "text": "Seeing myself through the eyes of others has been an interesting experience.  The scope of reactions is as broad as the full color spectrum.   \rWe will start with the few nay-sayers. \rOne friend causally commented she wouldn't be \"crazy enough\" to bring her mother into her home.  Another acquaintance said pretty much the same thing about her father.  Both comments were said to me with an attitude that I was the crazy one taking on this responsibility.  Another person sent me an email just prior to mom's early discharge from rehab.  She expressed concern that I seemed too overly positive about bring mom home early. She felt the need to offer a bulleted list of problems she thought I was over looking. She wanted to provide some \"balance\" to my \"over enthusiasm\" about bringing mom home.\rIn all these cases I felt that I was being judged and somehow coming up short in their eyes. The comments upset me initially but I got over it.\rI believe the roots for these comments could come from a variety of reasons.  The simple truth is that not all parent-child relationships are successful ones.  In some situations there is no room to bring an elder parent into a child's home.  Some seniors would refuse an offer to live with a child even if all other elements were perfect.  Some forms of dementia result in behaviors that are extremely antisocial or impossible to manage in a home setting.  Mom and I had none of those problems, but even we find this living arrangement and care giving relationship difficult at times ... and we started out with a solid foundation. I have learned to accept this unsolicited feedback for what it probably is - a reflection of what the speaker can not do ... and a way to justify their position.\rThe majority of the comments, however,  are good ones.  They center on how lucky mom is to have such a supportive daughter and family.  And I would agree that she is lucky since I have had a chance to see first hand how some elderly live.\rI do have 3 remembrances that top my list of positive comments ...\rAt the start of mom's home care this past spring, an intake nurse came to our house to get her history and take stock of how we were set up.  He started down his check list of questions ...\rDo you have ...\rAdvanced Directives - checkMedical Power of Attorney - checkrailings in the bathroom - checkshower stall seat - checkhand held shower head - checkraised toilet seats - checkhand rails in the hall - checkbed rails - checkwalker - checkwheel chair - check\"very nice stair lift you have\"  :-) ... checkThe list continued. It was an exhaustive one.  I began to feel like he was trying to trip me up.  Check, check, check.  I didn't miss a one. Do you know how it feels to get an A+ on a math test when you are terrible at Math? \rI had just got an A+ in Advanced Calculus!\rNow, to be fair, by the time this nice gentleman entered our lives, mom had been through a many hospitalizations and sub acute rehab experiences.  We were no longer rookies.  We had failed a few check list tests in the past.  But not now!  I had finally hit my stride.\rI am sure I was gloating a bit by the end. You know how gloating looks: smirky little face, checking my watch, tapping my fingers on the table, sighing, checking my watch again ... \rObnoxious, really!  :-)\rFinally he stopped and look at me.  \"You know, you are poster girl for care givers.\"  \rOK, so now this is where I share a deep secret with you!  You must promise to keep this from my husband.   I have always wanted to be a poster girl.  You know the kind.  Gorgeous pin up in a bathing suit, smiling seductively into the camera, long blond hair thrown over one shoulder ... Farrah Fossett like!!  \rCan you picture it?  \rNo *sigh* ... me neither! \rAnd fortunately for all the universe that never happened. I was never pin up material.\rBUT if you can only have your second choice, I go with the care giving poster girl shot, me standing efficiently against a hall grab bar, a raised toilet seat propped in the foreground, 3 pronged cane in one hand and weekly meds dispenser in the other, smiling (wearily) into the camera.\rMy second runner up in the \"positive comments category\" happened a few years ago. I remember visiting my daughter's place of work ... one of her early positions in the assisted living industry (Yes, I am lucky enough to have a daughter professionally connected to the elder care industry.  She is my life line at times, and she is a pretty sensational daughter as well!)\rYou may take a moment to be jealous now!   I'll wait.:-)Moment is over.\rAnyway, she took me for a tour of her facility, and I met several of her co-workers. My daughter mentioned to a colleague in passing that I was the care giver for her grandmother and that her grandmother lived with me.  I remember the woman stopped and turned to me. She thanked me for being willing to care for my mother in my home.   \rSo ... here we have a woman whose job it is to care for the elderly at her facility, and she is thanking me, a total stranger, for taking care of mom in my home.  \rThat \"thanks\" meant a lot to me.\rFinally, the first place winner in this category is:\rIn the last few months (difficult months for sure) another set of eyes and a voice has been heard, and it stands ahead of the sexy poster girl comment and the thankful professional care giver comment. \rWhen mom goes to bed, I always come upstairs to her bedroom with a glass of cold water for her bedside and to kiss her good night.  Recently she has taken to thanking me for everything I did for her that day. \rThe first time I heard those words was after a particularly difficult hospital stay in December.  She was too weak to ride home in my car.  She arrived by ambulance and was carried up to her bedroom by transport staff.  When we were finally alone and I was helping her into bed, she turned to me and said in a small voice, \"Thank you so much for getting me home safely tonight.\" \rThe room was dark and we were both very tired, but I remember my eyes tearing up.  \rI responded in almost a whisper because my voice was unreliable at that moment ... \r\"You are very welcome, mom.\"\rRetired KnitterCare Giver and Daughter"},
{"title": "Vet Report", "date": "Thursday, September 1, 2011", "text": "Maximillian\"Max\"Some news must be shared!Good news, when it is a rare visitor in your life, is reason to rejoice.My husband and I share our lives with 2 feline brothers, Max and Wally.  This month was their annual physicals.  I always dread these visits.  To begin with, the boys are not good travelers.  I guess that is because every time they travel, they visit the vet ... a very nice man who has been our vet for a very long time.When they were 3, it was discovered that Max has early onset degenerative kidney disease.  That news was hard to accept.  Kidney disease in older cats is common.  We have been down that path before with several older cats.Kidney disease at 3 is a very hard thing to acknowledge.  It most certainly means a shorten life for Max.As soon as it was discovered, we began corrective measures: prescription food, reduced stress, and subcutaneous fluids every other day.  With those changes maybe we could delay the inevitable.  And every year they both have the full blood and urine work up.  Believe me when I say that those yearly trips are expensive.  But I am a firm believer that when you accept a pet into your home and your into life, they are family.  They get the care that is needed to provide as comfortable and as long a life as God intends. And so, Max has been getting subcutaneous fluids every other day for 2 years.  Last year, Max's blood work results showed that he was relatively stable.  There were some values that had pointed to continuing degenerative changes to his kidneys.  But the vet was happy.  These slow changes are expected, he said. I was happy too, but downward health changes to all the beings that share my home were the norm now.  Any reduced kidney function in Max, no matter how small, added to the weight my heart was carrying.Today we got Max's recent lab values back.  The vet was hard pressed to explain it ... Max's kidney values were better!!!  He said he always hopes that things remain stable, but he has never seen kidneys show improvement.  Never.Wallace \"Wally\"And Wally, totally normal!!Today is a very, very good day."},
{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - Second Guessing", "date": "Wednesday, August 31, 2011", "text": "These years have been an emotional roller coaster.  Tears, struggle, anger, humor, sadness, frustration, loss, laughter, reflection, love ... all mixed together like multi-colored confetti.  \rAnd through all my ups and downs, mom's own emotional responses seemed a bit flat.  Yes, sometimes she would show frustration, laugh at the antics of one of the dogs, anticipate an event, show interest in a hobby, but it was short lived. Was this an aspect of her mental decline, or depression, or something else?  I started to second guess myself.  \rWas this related to her shrinking social circle?\rI worried that I had made a poor decision by inviting her into my home.  Five years ago I firmly believed I was broadening her life.  She would have daily company, my kids dropped in a lot, my grand-dogs and cats were always under foot, my neighborhood had stability with an eclectic mix of people.  Surely that was better than sitting alone in her apartment with only TV for company.  But maybe a better choice might have been assisted living where she would enjoy the company of new faces, make friends and participate in planned activities.  She would stay socially connected to life within her own generation. \rBut the realities of assisted living, beyond the social benefits, were a concern.  Her financial resources would not have sustained her for the long life that she is leading.  I also wondered if her medical problems would have been captured readily.  And now the subtle symptoms of her chronic illnesses raise questions for me.  Would they be noticed and medicated promptly to avoid hospitalizations? Would her connection to family have been as frequent?  Or would the \"out of sight, out of mind\" mentality eventually become the norm for all of us.  \rWhile the choice of assisted living would have been easier for me, I don't believe it would have been best mom. Maybe in the future we will be forced into that option.  But five years ago I don't think it was the right choice.\rCertainly a senior apartment with less monitoring would have been a terrible choice for her in light of her hidden medical conditions.  \rLooking back I know I made mistakes.   For example, it is true that I didn't check in with family before I moved mom in with me.   There was no family meeting to discuss our options. Mother and I discussed her options for years, but it wasn't a conversation that included others. I have apologized for this omission several times.  When I heard that criticism, I started to second guess myself again. \rI tried to think back to determine exactly when that meeting should have been.  Should the meeting have occurred after her auto accident, or possibly after she proved so indecisive, or maybe when her rents went up, or was it most appropriate after the first hospitalization?  And based on my concerns about senior apartments and assisted living, would our choice of residence for mom be any different than it is today?   \rAs an observer, it is easy to say \"I would have done things differently.\"  But I wasn't an observer, and I know I would not have done anything differently.\rLike a glacier, mom moved steadily in one declining direction.  She lived closest to me.  I was a steady presence in her life.  My actions were not made with any selfish or ulterior motives.  At the time, I was the one \"connecting the dots\" of mom's decline.  I was the one who took action.\rUnfortunately, it is true beyond all measure ... that you can take the right actions for the right reasons, and still you will not please everyone. You just have to move on and listen to your own conscious.\rI think this care giving journey unconsciously began for me in 1997  while staring at that crushed Honda Civic.  I was alone that day standing in the tow lot with my horrifying thoughts and emotions.   If I had been with other family at that moment, would they have had the same reaction, the same protective step forward for mom? Would my actions from that day forward have been more of a partnership ... if we had shared together that first glimpse of what could have been a tragedy?\rSecond guessing.\rI still doubt myself at times, but I believe I have made decisions I can live with.\rI haven't caused harm  ...I've made carefully considered decisions on her behalf ...I've made one elderly person's life better ... I've gained a new respect for the difficult road ahead in my aging ...\rAnd, most importantly, I have learned to be grateful for having spent this time with mom.\rYou see, while I am walking through this care giver life with its twists and turns, frustrations and difficulties, it is easy to forget that -\r... I am lucky she is still a part of my life.... I love her dearly.... and I can give back when she needs it the most.\rIn my \"travels\" with mom, I have met many people.  Most people whose moms are gone feel compelled to share. Frequently they say -\r\"I would love to walk in your shoes - even for just one day!\"\rI am lucky, and there is no second guessing about that.\rRetired KnitterCare Giver and Daughter"},

{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - Guilt", "date": "Monday, August 29, 2011", "text": "I had pledged to have \"no regrets\".  \rI would take all the steps necessary to keep her healthy and functional.  To make sure the medical care she received was correct, consistent, reasonable without being too invasive or inappropriate.  I changed her doctor of 15 years when he failed to be responsive to her home nurse.  I \"lived\" at the hospital and the rehab facilities with mom whenever her foot passed their threshold.  I guarantee that some of the staff at those places never want to see my face again, because I can be a pain in the a** when I am tired and worried.\rNo regrets!  I would do what needed to be done.\rBut another emotion raises its ugly head from time to time.\rGuilt.\rGuilt is an insidious creepy bug.  It gets into your mind through the cracks of your armour. Guilt is the internal enemy I deal with on occasion.\rIt all begins with the best of intentions. \rSometimes I'd think she could do better at her exercises or her walking. And I'd push her. \"Come on mom, you can walk a little faster.  Remember this is exercise, and you need to push yourself.\"  And then I'd discover the truth of her inactivity. She was walking slowly or sleeping so much because she had a fever and was on the crest of another serious infection. \rGuilt.\rI would want her to do more for herself so she wasn't sitting around all the time. I'd tell her to get a glass of water if she was thirsty or to make her own lunch if I am out.  I'd remind her that all these normal activities add up to cumulative exercise.  That walking to the kitchen, going to the refrigerator, pouring her own water, returning to her chair ... these normal of activities of daily living were good for her.  In essence - when she would ask for water, I would ask her to get the water herself! And then I would discover her arthritis in her hands was bothering her and she couldn't open the water jug easily, and pulling and pushing the heavy freeze door for ice was difficult.  The cup she wanted was too high to reach.  She had difficulty managing her walker and a glass filled with water as she returned to her chair. \rGuilt.\rAnd yet I would remind her that if she lived on her own, she would find a way to manage these things. And that exercise of every day life would keep her strong. \rShe would try.  She never balked at these requests.  She would always try.  Sometimes she would be successful, sometimes she wasn't, and usually when she wasn't, it was because of something out of her control.\rGuilt.\rAnd sometimes I would get short with her over silly things ... knowing all the time she is basically a pleasant person, not mean or intolerant like some elderly I have heard about.  She seldom responds back when I am short of temper.  And then looking inward I would realize that I was really the one with the problem.  Not her. \rGuilt.\rAnd then there is the desire to claim back more of my life, more normal things that others do.  To spend unfettered time with friends without the worry about getting home.  To be more of a wife to my husband ... to have the freedom for us both to be out of the house together more often.  To visit our son's campground just once (he's been there 3 summers and we have never seen it), to see the place my son and his fiance have chosen to get married next year, to help my daughter when she moves.  Just normal stuff ...\r... and of course there is ... you guessed it ... guilt!\rYou see,  Mom doesn't have her normal life either.  Does she remember the normal things she used to do?  Does she wish for the car she once owned and the freedom to drive away as she once could?  How much would she love to just go to the grocery store by herself again without the aid of a walker? Or what about just going for a simple walk down the street without stopping to rest? How about the simplest of things ... the luxury of a private bath or shower? \rWanting my life back seems small compared to all the losses  she has sustained.   \rThe emotions of being a full time care giver are complex.  It is easy to say \"you have nothing to feel guilty about.\"  But guilt does not respond to reason and logic.  It is a personal emotion that arise from within, from the total of who you are as an individual, how you were raised, what your values are, and how well you meet them. \rAnd how do I deal with these emotions?\rNot as well as I would like, but one technique helps.\rI focus on ... today!  \rToday she woke with a smile on her face (actually, she does that all the time).  Today she is well or getting well. Today she can go for a walk outside because the air quality is good and the temperature is comfortable. Today we have company coming for dinner, and she loves guests. Today my daughter is coming for a visit, and mom really enjoys seeing her.  Today my grand dogs will be here, and they are a happy distraction. Today her other daughter plans to visit, and she misses her bubbly personality.\rToday!\rToday ... it is all any of us have.  I focus on \"today\" and try to be positive so I don't add to the guilt I already carry.\rAnd it should be said ... it helps when I write.   :-)\rRetired KnitterCare Giver and Daughter"},

I have slept through earthquakes so I was sure I wouldn't wake up till morning.\rWhat do I see today?all the trees around my house are still standingthere are leaves all over the place - guess the winds did shake the trees a bitwe never lost powermy kitchen had a large puddle of clean water in the middle of it - the \"flood\" was not from Irene, but because I failed to plug the drain in my cooler full of melting ice and food.my basement had a huge mess of dirty water because my husband brought all the large plant pots filled with wet dirt into the house forgetting that each pot had a hole in the bottom.I think we caused more damage to ourselves than Irene did.  :-)\rWe will see World's End another day.And I'll remember to put the plug in my cooler next time.\rHope it was as uneventful for you as it was for me.\rCheers!\r\rOur Tuesday morning knitting group has become a favorite time during my week.  Tuesday morning has become my sane day, my happy pill, my mental health break, my time with friends.  Many hobbies fall under the knitting group label (knitting, crochet, weaving, needle point) and many types of people have made time in their busy week, just like me, to spend this precious time together. \rSpring, Summer and Fall we knit outside.  Among the knitting community at large \"Knitting in Public Day\" falls on a Saturday in June.  But our group has enjoyed knitting outside, knitting in public,  every week long before it became the \"in thing\" to do.  \rToday, Deb, one of our members, arrived wearing her latest finished object - this beautiful knitted top. She is an extremely talented knitter.  When she knits a sweater, she starts with one pattern and then make changes to suit her whimsy.  Sometimes she combines 2 or 3 patterns pulling the best from each to create a much improved design.  And the outcome is always spectacular.\rWhen I knit I follow instructions ... to the letter, exactly as the designer intended, no divergent paths, no stepping outside the box, no nothing.  I know. Boring.  But if it wasn't written, it wasn't done.   And never, never, never does my stuff turn out this good. \rToday's pictures spotlight Deb's latest creation - totally flattering.\r\rIt is wonderful to be surrounded by such wonderful and talented knitting friends."},
{"title": "World's End - Part 2", "date": "Saturday, August 27, 2011", "text": "Still here. \rGuess \"the end\" will sometime later.  :-)\r6:50 pm Had dinner, cleaned up the kitchen, rain is still just at the level of a normal rain storm without thunder and lightening.  But we hear that the storm will pick up steam between now until 10:00 pm.\rSo some cute stories:\rYesterday I had the most yummy MacDonneld's French Fries and a frozen coffee Mocha.  Yes, I am still on my diet, but as I was riding into Bethesda to pick up Milo, I had the strongest urge for a frozen something and French Fries.  Finally half way to Milo's house I stopped and indulged.   After I finished my treat, a news reporter said that when there are big storms (like snow and hurricanes), nature can sometimes increase our desire to eat!  Sort of like storing up our fat against famine ... \rI felt justified.  I blame this lapse in my diet on Hurricane Irene. :-)\rAnother radio listener called in to share his personal story.  The caller, I'll call him John, said that his ex-wife and her husband were in town staying in a camper to visit their son.  With the hurricane coming they had no where to safely wait out the storm.  So John invited them to his house to stay.  Then John's wife, I'll call her Sally, discovered that her ex-husband and his wife were in town and called wanting some where to stay to wait out the storm.  So now John and Sally have both their ex-spouses and their spouses staying under the same roof for the storm.  \rNot my idea of a good time!  :-)\r7:10 pm - Looked outside...getting a little windy.  Still no more than a normal rainy day.  But turn on the TV and it is \"the end of the world\".\rOh well, I am sure things will heat up.  Hope everyone stays safe.Today is the day!  World's End.  \rOk, that is an exaggeration, but if you take the news reporters seriously, they can make it sound like the end is near.\r\r9:20 am - Noth'en yet. The sky is gray and ground is wet, but it is humid and still.\r11:30 am - Took my two grand dogs home to their \"papa\" to weather the storm at their own house.  Hurricane Irene's wet fingers splashed across our area with a few short showers.\r1:30 pm - Went for a walk.  Got wet. The rain was gentle but consistent.  The sky was getting darker.  \r3:00 pm - The intensity of the storm has picked up for Maryland's ocean shores and the waves are getting higher.  Here ... still pretty quiet like any other normal rainy day, but there is no thunder or lightening like most storms bring.  News promises that by late afternoon we she see increasing wind and wind gusts.\r3:15 pm - Finished setting up the cooler with foods and beverages that we might need.  We have a 50-50 chance of losing power according to our Governor.  The cooler seemed like a reasonable step to take.  I also made tomorrow morning's coffee already.  I usually don't care for old coffee, but no coffee would be even worse.\r\rSpring of 2007 was our first hospitalization together. There would be others, of course. But thankfully she had no other recurrences of TIAs.  I retired that spring.  The effort of holding down a full time job and the growing demands with mom had left me tired.  \rThe years following this first hospitalization were filled with a blur doctor's visits, new medications, other hospitalizations and sub acute rehabilitation experiences.  Each hospitalization took a small part of mom energy, strength and health that were never recovered despite all the supportive medical services. Like a downward stair case where each step disappears behind you ... mom's health slipped. \rShe did have her well periods, but independence was slowly chipped away.  \rShe stopped driving after a few big errors in judgement while I was a passenger in her car.  I remember one time when she had a problem parking into an easy pull-in slot.  She seemed embarrassed.  I made light of it and said \"It happens. Just pull out and try again.\"  My heart ached at that moment because I knew another difficult conversation was ahead of us.  She tried again.  Her second attempt was not successful either.  I talked her through the third try, and the car was finally parked.  She pulled the key out of the ignition, and turned to me.  \"You know, I think I probably should think about giving up driving soon,\" she said.   My heart was pounding in my chest.  I knew she had left a small opening for me to walk through.  So I did ... \"Yes mom, I think it is time.\"\rShe made that difficult conversation ... easy.  It was kind of like a gift from her to me. It was not something I realized at the time because my emotions were so strong.  But now I know, it was a gift.  A sad gift.\rOther things began to slide as well.  She couldn't manage her own medications on a proper schedule. She used a cane all the time.  Watching her climb the stairs to the bedroom level made me nervous. Climbing any steps without the assistance of a hand rail was not possible.  All chairs needed arms so she could push herself up.  The coffee maker and the microwave were too confusing for her.  She could not find clothes stored in the closet or drawers. The tub became a safety issue. Writing a check to pay her one bill was an effort.  These things didn't happen over night, but over the period of several years.  \rAt each juncture we made adjustments to our home and to our lives. And as each change was made, she resisted.  She didn't want any adjustments to accommodate her.  She would get along without them. She would be careful.  She would have no accidents.  Why spend money on that stuff.  And my favorite excuse was, \"I don't really need that.  I am fine.\"  \rSo many disagreements.  \rA stair lift to the bedroom level was installed and hand rails added to our exterior steps. One of our kitchen chairs with  arms was moved to her bedroom so she had a place to sit while dressing.  I took over her medications completely. Her clothing was stacked on her rocker so she could see it.  Interior hand rails, bars and shower aids were installed in her bathroom and the hall. I wrote her checks.  She gave her car to my sister.  \rThe most noticeable change was the addition of a new lounge chair in the living room.  This chair reclines back, but it can also lift you up to almost a standing position, all with the touch of a button. We have had a few laughs as a result of this chair.  Once she plopped down on the seat forgetting that the control was under her.  The chair immediately began to recline.  Mom's startled look was priceless. We both found it funny.  It took me 5 years, but I finally got smart on the purchase of the recliner.  I purchased it while she was in the hospital.  When she came home it was there. No arguments. She loves it. :-)\r\rShe also learned to love that stair lift she resisted so vehemently.   She never told me personally how much she appreciated it, but one day my son was here with her while my husband and I were out.  They were sitting in the living room together, and at some point mom decided to go up stairs.  As she settled into the chair lift seat and pushed the button to begin the ride up, she commented aloud to herself ... \"I sure do love this chair.\"  My son shared that comment with me because he knew about the arguments she and I had regarding its instillation.  I remember smirking sarcastically when I heard that she liked it.  But later it gave me a warm feeling to know that she valued this piece of vital equipment.\rAll these losses and changes took their toll on her and me. \rFor mom it was a constant reminder that things were changing permanently, that her body and mind were failing her, and that her ability to be independent was slipping away.\rI became more the care giver and less the daughter. Mom needed both, but, unfortunately I usually had energy for only one.\rIt has taken me a few years to reach my stride in this new role ... I now can say that I manage both: care giver and daughter.  But it wasn't always so.\rRetired KnitterCare Giver and Daughter"},

I have a blogging schedule to maintain, and not even the earth moving under my feet changes that!!! \r :-) (Could I be a little rigid, maybe?)\rYes, just like everyone on the east coast of the US I felt the earthquake, and I have a bit of a story to tell.\rOf course, I wasn't anywhere special.  I was typing away on my computer in the kitchen.  My husband was playing away on his XBox 360 game in the living room.  Mom was sitting on the deck off the kitchen enjoying the sun.\rLife was normal and quiet for a change.  (I knew it couldn't last.)\rGently the room started to shimmy.\rI looked up at the corner cabinet.  The glass door was moving back and forth.  The walls were trembling. The whole house seemed to have a case of the jitters.\rI looked at my husband.  He never stopped playing his Xbox game.  I checked mom.  She was still sitting quietly on the deck as if nothing was happening.  I jumped up and kept looking around.  I looked again at mom.  Her glass of water was giggling next to her hand.  Her expression never changed.   My husband was still playing his Xbox game.  \rIn that 5 seconds I thought I had finally gone nuts!! \rYep!\rThat was it.  I had finally flipped out from stress!!!\rThe corner cabinet began to rattle more.  Some glasses started to bump against each other. \rhmmm....\rMaybe it was time to say something ...\r\"Hey, do you think we are having an earthquake?\" I called to my husband.  He pulled his eyes from the TV screen and said, \"Why yes, I think so.\"  Man, he was calm. But he missed a golden opportunity to deny it and play with my mind a bit.  \rI opened the slider door to speak to mom.  \"Mom, I think we are having an earthquake.\" She responded with annoyance, \"Well, some'tens going on!\"  But she never moved or blinked an eye.\rShoot, was I the only one who was worried about this?\rApparently!\rAnd then it stopped.\rI flipped on the TV. It took the news about 10 minutes to catch up to what everyone else already knew.  We had an earthquake.\r*****Ok guys,  I can play that game too.\rSo this coming Saturday, when Hurricane Irene finally arrives in Maryland, when the winds are howling at 55 miles an hour, and the wind gusts reach 70 miles an hour, and the darkness covers the sky, and the rain shoots sideways in blinding sheets of water, and the guttering on the house begins to peal off, and tree limbs are flying through the air, and the waters begin to rise  ... \rI am going to be cool.

{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - The First ER Visit", "date": "Thursday, August 25, 2011", "text": "(continued from August 23, 2011)\r\rOur first medical scare appeared without warning.\rMom had driven us to the local senior center.  Walking into the center she greeted friends and acquaintances warmly.  The director of the center greeted her at the door.  Mom used to be a regular at the center, and many were glad to see her back.\rWhile chatting with the director, the left side of mom's mouth began to droop.  Her speech became slurred.  She continued talking as if nothing was wrong, but my eyes were transfixed on her face, knowing exactly what I was seeing.  But denial is a terrible thing.  My brain raced to find another reason. We probably lost precious minutes while my mind desperately tried to control my panic and find another cause other than \"stroke\". \rFinally I asked the director if she noticed the change in mother - she did, and quickly left to call Emergency.  I led mom to a chair.  Unhappy and complaining that nothing was wrong, Mother complied.  But as she reach the chair her speech had totally degraded to gibberish.  I still remember the dawning look on her face.  What she was hearing did not match what her brain thought she was saying.  \rFear hung in the air ... curiously not for her.  But it covered me totally from head to toe. \rI followed the ambulance to the hospital.  By the time I had been allowed into the ER, mom's speech had returned to normal.  It was a frightening 30 minutes or so, but the short episode passed quickly with no lingering impacts - at least we didn't think so initially.  The diagnosis was TIA - a mini stroke.  The hospital kept her over night to run tests.  She complained about all the fuss.  She wanted to go home. \rAt one point in our stay she made a very telling statement.  In her frustration at being hospitalized she bemoaned, \"I don't know what all the fuss is about.  If this had happened at home, I would have laid down and taken a nap.  And when I got up it would be gone.\"\rIt was a blinding flash of insight for me.  This had happened before and that was exactly what she had done. That is why she was not frightened by the event.  How many times had she experienced this and how much damage had been done I would never know.  \rBeyond a doubt, the move into our home, a move into our lives, was the correct choice. How many more times would she have ignored the signs of a stroke before she died or was terribly disabled and institutionalized by a major stroke.\rI finally felt the weight of my new role.  I knew she was not making correct decisions for her self.  Her previous actions may have caused damage in her brain and reduced her functioning.  She could never reliably live independently.  \rI was her care giver.\rThat first year together was a watershed year.  We had been relatively lucky up to that point. All the previous years ... years when my radar had been sending me alarm messages, years when I tried vainly to get her into another living situation ... those years were indeed years when she did need help, when she was not coping well, when she made bad decisions. And probably she had a few mini-strokes.\rI felt relief that she lived with me.\rThe year was still 2007. \rAnd it was in 2007 that I began to understand fully the personal price you pay for being a full time care giver.\rRetired KnitterDaughter and Care Giver"},

{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - The First Year", "date": "Tuesday, August 23, 2011", "text": "(continued from August 21, 2011)\r\rI promised!\rNothing would change, but the roof over her head.  \rAnd I broke that promise.  Everything did change. \rEventually.\rThankfully, by the time I was breaking that promise she had forgotten I had made it.  Sadly, she had forgotten a lot of things, but my promise, the one I made in good faith and a giving heart ... that promise I am glad she didn't remember. \rAnd now looking back at that broken promise, I believe it was the first of many future events that would make me sad.  Sadness that the aging process, which joyfully gave us so much in our early years as we matured into adulthood ... that same aging process now robs us of so much at the end of life.  It was the beginning of all that for mother and I. \rI just didn't know it at the time.\rInitially our lives joyfully went on as we planned.  I prepared 2 rooms in our townhouse for her: a bedroom and a den.  She also had 3 closets and her own bathroom.  The rooms were emptied of our stuff, painted, carpets cleaned and filled with her remaining belongings after she downsized. I had her own phone line installed and cable TV in her den.  \rThe move went smoothly.\rShe drove to church every day and visited friends.  She managed her own meds and requested refills when needed.  She made her own doctors' appointments and went to them by herself.  She climbed our many, many steps every day.  She paid her own bills.  She helped with dinner and tried to help with cleaning.  She changed her own bed sheets and made her bed every day.  I did her laundry because it was in the basement and it was another flight of stairs she didn't need to tackle, but in the first 6 months she tried to do that as well.  \rMy husband and I, however, notice small subtle changes ... changes you would notice only if you were with her every day.  A sort of relaxed state - a stepping back.  It was almost as if the idea of independence was not that important to her anymore ... maybe I had been promising her something that she really didn't want.\rThat first year was full of discoveries. Each discovery carried with it an added level of concern.  She hadn't been able to balance her check book for quite some time prior to the move.  My husband took over that task.  But he commented that her checkbook was simple, only 2 or 3 checks a month, and it was easily balanced.  She was grateful that it was finally balanced, but another small red flag peeped its ugly head over the fence of our lives.  \rShe had been dealing with several medical issues that were not known to us while living in our separate abodes.  I took the lead in getting proper care for those conditions.  Sometime during that year I started going with her to doctor's appointments.  She couldn't seem to verbalize what the doctor said or why certain tests had been ordered. If I wanted to know, I needed to be there.  And I heard frequently her physicians comment that they were glad I was coming with her.   They didn't make a big deal of it, but there was a noticeable sense of relief - as if concerns were growing in them as well.\rThe first year confirmed that her move into our home rather than into another place had been the right choice.  So many unknowns about her health and mental state had become evident.  If she had lived in a senior apartment separate from family, would we have known the true state of her functioning and health?  Probably not.  \rAnd despite all the little signs of trouble, I still didn't feel that I was her \"care giver.\"   I recognized she needed a helping hand and some words of advice now and then, but that didn't define \"care giver\" in my mind.\rAll that changed at the end of the first year when we had our first major health scare ... at least the first major health scare I was witness to.  The year was 2007.  It was spring.\rRetired KnitterDaughter and Care Giver\r\r\r\rA startling thing happened to me on Sunday! So startling to my mind that I forgot my manners.  I failed to comment on it publicly and thank this blogger for her most gracious nod in my direction.\rI was asked by Doris Plaster to guest post on her blog called Hold My Hand.  Doris is a social worker in a nursing home, and her blog postings are a reflection of her professional experiences presented in the form of touching short stories.  I believe they also raise the awareness in readers to the issues of aging with snippets of perspective and understanding. \rI \"met\" Doris this spring through an April A to Z Blogging Challenge.  I was drawn to her blog for obvious reasons - I live with an aging mother.  Recently she released a book that patterned her participation in that blog fest called Home Sweet Home: An A to Z collection of 50-word stories on aging and health care (Volume 1).  I am waiting for my copy from Amazon as I write.\rWhen I started the series of posts called Through My Care Giver Eyes, I never thought it would lead to guest posting on such an exceptional  and well respected blog.\rDoris, thank you so much for giving me this opportunity.

{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - August 21, 2011", "date": "Sunday, August 21, 2011", "text": "(continued from August 19, 2011)\rDiscussions were ongoing regarding her future living options.  We mapped them out on paper. Talked about the pros and cons.  Visits, however, to see any choices were always ... later.  And \"later\" never came.\rFinally external forces pushed her to do what I could not.  The apartment management changed and her rent jumped $200 a month.  Mom lived frugally by choice and by habit, and although she said she could manage the increase, I could tell from the tone of her voice that this increase was going to make things tight.  And what would following years bring?  More increases?  And how would she handle a move 2-3 years from now when she was that much older? No, we both agreed that this year was the year she must move.  This was the year!!\rBut to where?\rBecause she had delayed action in moving for a few years, changes in her functioning had definitely limited her choices for independent living. Assisted living was a choice but her financial resources were not inexhaustible.  Her social security and pension had comfortably sustained her for many years as well as her minimalist style of living, but how much longer could she outrun inflation, a major problem for many senior citizens.  \rAnd to my eyes, she now clearly needed assistance in certain aspects of her life.\rAgain we talked. \rShe had a new concern: all the details of the move, the cleaning out, the packing, all the address changes, the moving arrangements ... she saw this as a huge deterrent to moving at all, she didn't see how she could manage it ... maybe she should stay put for another year ... and again she began to back away from the decision.  I dug in my heels.  We couldn't dither about this any more.  Years of talking were over. Action was needed.  I finally convinced her that I could easily manage all the aspects of her move from her one bedroom apartment.  \rShe had to start to trust me.  This year really was the right year to move.\rAnd this time I offered the option of living with family ... living with me.  She didn't jump at it at first.  It was a decision, after all, and she had problems making decisions.  But in the end, she took the offer.  \rI began the process of moving her for what I hoped was the last time.\rDid I recognize the giant step forward I was taking into the care giving role?  No.  Not really.  \rI sincerely felt I was offering her a reasonable option for a viable living arrangement.  I assured her, promised her, that nothing would change, but the roof over her head.  She could still do her own things, attend activities, visit with friends, maintain her own independence.  My husband and I would still live our lives doing similar things.  We would share a house ... that was all!\rThe only valid criticism that I accept of my actions during this time was naivety.

{"title": "Friendship", "date": "Saturday, August 20, 2011", "text": "The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart.~ Elisabeth Foley\r\rWhat a true statement.\rI do believe that friendship is a convoluted subject, one that isn't easily discussed without using  generalities or platitudes.  My life has been filled with many friendships, but I wanted to give a nod to the special kind of friendship that doesn't fit the typical friendship mold. \rThe seldom seen or talked to friend!  The friend you are instantly at ease with even if it has been 10 years since you last talked.\rAs a child or young person friends seem to be an important influence and fluid part of our lives.  As a child, friends can be casually made in a moment.  Ask a child who has just spent time playing in the sandbox with a new acquaintance ... who is this person they are spending time with and they usually say without hesitation \"my friend\".   Teens place a great importance on the opinions of their \"friends\" - peer pressure is all about friends and what they think and how you fit in.\rBut as you mature you realize that not everyone who crosses your path in life is a friend. By mid life many established friendships are tested by distance, time or hardship.  Sometimes those tested friendships disappear.  Later in life some long term friendships can almost reach the level of family ties.\rI am blessed with the ability to make friends easily.  I count a diverse group of people among my friends.  As the quote above reflects, friendship should be able to stand the test of individual growth and change.  Friends who are cookie cutter images of me are not as satisfying as those hold a different perspective.\rThe most surprising friendships for me are the ones that are not nurtured.  You hear all the time ... friendships, relationships, marriages ... they need caring and tending to be successful.  And yet, I personally have a hand full of friends who I rarely see or communicate with, and when we get together it is like no time has passed, no changes in who we are have occurred. \rYet, change has occurred. Life changes you.  But the basic underlying relationship is unchanged.  The comfort in each other's company remains.\rWhy is that!  \rCan it be said that friendship is more of a chemistry thing? You either have a good chemistry with a person or you don't.\rOr is the art of building friendships more an individual thing? Are some individuals more open to the differences of others and that is what makes the friendship work between 2 divergent people?\rI can think of at least 5 individuals who fit this category of \"distant friend\" - no matter when they bump into my life, we are in sync. \rDo you have friends like that?"},
{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - August 19, 2011", "date": "Friday, August 19, 2011", "text": "(continued from August 16, 2011)\rMom recuperated from her accident at my house for about a week.  She could barely walk and even after returning to her home,  she needed lots of help.  Food shopping, laundry, rides to the doctor and church ... but over time she recovered, she got a new car and took back bits and pieces of her life. \rI really thought we were back to normal.\rBut then another behavior began to emerge.   I discovered that talking took the place of action for mom.  Although she was always a cautious person, I didn't remember her delaying actions indefinitely.  Talk about taking computer classes and getting a computer went on for a year or more. Talk about her need for hearing aids lasted almost a year.  Concerns about her rising rent and a possible move to another place went on for two or three years.  Through it all, we talked and talked, and planned and planned, but I couldn't seem to prompt her to action.\rEventually I convinced her to get hearing aids. A hearing test had shown her hearing loss was severe.  But it was probably 8 months before she would wear the new hearing aids full time.   At least I was content that she could hear sirens when driving her car or people approaching her from behind when she walked on the street.\rBut I had uncomfortable thought that maybe she had passed some mental invisible line in her functioning.  Everything took so long to achieve.\rMost worrisome was how frail she was getting. She still went out for walks in her neighborhood, but they were slow and measured with the help of a cane.  At times she seemed to be overly trusting of casual acquaintances.  As I left her apartment after each visit, I would watch her.  She would follow me out to my car, and watch as I left, waving all the time, then walking back to her front door - slowly and carefully.  \rI couldn't help but worry that as she was getting older and weaker, she was becoming a target for bad things that sometime happen against the elderly. \rDuring a short period of 4 or 5 years, friends were moved away or went into retirement communities, trusted neighbors were leaving, some close friends died.  She also seemed to be pulling away from her normal social circles - doing less of everything. She stopped traveling, taking only occasional day trips.  And then even the day trips stopped. And decisions about all things, big and little, became more and more difficult for her.  Discussions and conversations were only partially remembered.  Important things were written down so she could refer to them later. Soon even unimportant things were written as well.  Taking action on anything was lacking. \rThe circle of her life was shrinking noticeably.\rMaybe I was over reacting, watching too much crime TV, reading too many newspaper stories about crimes against the elderly ... maybe.  But I know my personal radar was picking up changes in mom that required action from those who cared about her. \rI struggled then, as I do now, with how to balance her rights to independence (as much as she could manage) against my concerns for her health, safety and quality of life.   My yardstick in dealing with mom was to treat her as I wanted to be treated when I was her age.  So we continued to talk as I sought to move her through decision making into action.  Movement was slow going.\rIt definitely was the harder road to travel.  I always seem to pick the harder road.\rAnd the forward steps by me towards being a full time care giver were occurring without conscious thought or plan.  I was just doing the things that needed to be done for a member of my family.  To do otherwise seemed to be irresponsible. \rRetired KnitterDaughter and Care GiverComments can be sent to Retiredknitter@gmail.com"},
{"title": "Book Review - Little Red in the City", "date": "Thursday, August 18, 2011", "text": "My trip to the Mannings earlier in the month resulted in a few purchases.  \rShocking fact, I know!!  :-)\rLittle Red in the City by Ysolda Teague caught my eye right away.  I picked it up many times always setting it down, but returning again to look further.  One of those times I picked it up, I carried it around the store with me while I shopped for other stuff.  I think I sent it down again, but when I got in line with my yarn purchase ... miraculously that book was back in my arms and showed up on my sales slip.  Go figure!\rYsolda is a young Scottish designer of knitting patterns.  The chatter among the knitting community about this book's upcoming publication seemed to pop up everywhere among those interested in knitting.  I have tried to avoid buying knitting books.  I have a large knitting library and I didn't need another book ... until I saw this one.\rThe focus in this book is fitting and sizing.  This critical information can make or break a finished knitted object.  After hours of planning, and knitting, even thousands of perfect stitches will fall short if the fit is wrong when you put it on.  Been there, done that!\rBut that is only one reason I bought this book.\rI totally loved the lack of stick thin models wearing the sweaters.  Really - some people can wear a potato sack and look good.  But normal people have to pick carefully.  The world is filled with more normal sized people than stick people.\rYsolda and her friend Amanda did all the modeling.  Ysolda represents the normal shape and weight of your average woman.  Amanda represents the larger women.  Both wear all the sweater styles. Using real world bodies helps you see how each design looks on different body types.\r\rAnother wonderful feature of the book is the presentation.  Throughout you feel like you are viewing some one's personal project notebook.  Pictures that appear to be mounted with corner tabs, text type that mimics hand written notes, hand drawn schematics that put other simplistic line drawings to shame, beautifully drawn technique demonstrations ... these elements invite the reader to look further into this sometimes boring topic of fit and size.\r\rThe main thrust of the book is sizing and adjustments.  Who doesn't want to ensure that their finished object fits their one-of-a-kind body!?!   There are 15-17 sizes for each pattern, ranging from a 28 to 60 inch bust.  There is guidance within each pattern for fit adjustments.  There are large detailed charts for sizing of each design.\rMany books on similar topics fill book store shelves today, but I believe no one has captured the charm of this book. \rIt is in my stack of books to be read from cover-to-cover - not many knitting books sit there!!\r\rThe book retails for $32.00."},
{"title": "A Joke - A truth!", "date": "Wednesday, August 17, 2011", "text": "I got an email joke from a friend.I don't share jokes often as they are prolific circulating in emails. \rBut I had to share this one!\rThe English language has some wonderfully anthropomorphic collective nouns for the various groups of animals. We are all familiar with a Herd of cows, a Flock of chickens, a School of fish and a Gaggle of geese. However, less widely known is a Pride of lions, a Murder of crows (as well as their cousins the rooks and ravens), an Exaltation of doves and, presumably because they look so wise, a Parliament of owls. Now consider a group of Baboons. They are the loudest, most dangerous, most obnoxious, most viciously aggressive and least intelligent of all primates.  And what is the proper collective noun for a group of baboons?Believe it or not ....... a Congress! I guess that pretty much explains the things that come out of Washington!"},
{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - August 16, 2011", "date": "Tuesday, August 16, 2011", "text": "(continued from August 15, 2011)\r\rIn all of life you take steps ... steps towards something or steps away from something.  \rIt is movement.  Nothing is static.\rTrying to remember when I stepped forward into the role of care giver has been challenging.  The changes in life that preceded mom's move into my house were so subtle - sort of like the movement of a glacier that can only be quantified by looking back to where the glacier was years ago.\rBut I did try to look back.  \rOthers who have been witness to this progression might think they know exactly when it all began, speak with authority on the choices that were made with each step and feel confident to project just how the outcome could have been different. But unless you actually lived through the whole process in my skin and saw it through my eyes, those opinions are theories.  \rMom lived an independent life starting 1970 as a widow.   She struggled with uncertainty and unknowns in those initial years but she was a stronger person than she ever believed.  I am sure she developed the same thoughts and perspectives that I now hold about myself ... that I am capable and self-sufficient enough to not need help, that am I sound of mind and body and will never falter because I won't let it happen, that I refuse to be a burden to others.  She walked every day, enjoyed crafts, read books, she went to swim exercise, she stayed active socially with her friends, she traveled. She remained active and involved with life separate from her daughters.  She had no reason to doubt her beliefs of an independent and active future.\rBut age, genetics, and normal chemical changes in the aging brain can to rob you of all your plans and expectations.  It is stolen from you slowly - almost so slowly as to believe that it is not happening at all.  \rAnd so it was with mother. \rAnd when did my concerns for her arise?  \rI often wonder if the seeds of my concern were buried somewhere in my childhood.  There is no one memory that stands out, but the scope of many unhappy memories lumped together would be fertile soil for growth of gratitude toward this woman.  And from gratitude would come concern at her failing.\rThe most startling memories of those from my adult years.  I remember when she stopped going to her swim exercise.  She said it was because someone had stolen a hair scarf from her locker.  It seemed like such a small thing, and yet she gave up swimming - something she had done for years.  Why I remember that event is a mystery ... except that it might have been the first tiny little red flag for me.  Tiny as to be almost quickly forgotten.  She was still doing everything else.  What was the concern if she changed her one activity?  No big deal, right? ... and yet, I remember. For mom it was a tiny step back.  For me it was a tiny step of memory - a memory stored away - a concern - step forward ... for me. That probably was in the 1990s.\rAnother more significant event in the 90s shook her confidence.  She was involved in an auto accident.  Her car was hit by a motorist who ran a red light.  The impact threw her car across the street landing it on the far sidewalk.  Although not visibly injured at the scene, it was later discovered that her pelvis was cracked. I believe the realization of how close she had come to serious permanent injury or death changed her a bit.  \rThe day after her accident I remember going to the tow lot where they had taken her car. The car that hit her had plowed into her car just behind her driver seat - missing her by inches - and destroying the back end of the car - the car appeared to have been bent in half and the back half was total destruction.  Upon finding her car on the lot, I remember standing quite still, staring in disbelief at the pile of metal that was mother's Honda Civic, tears streaming down my face at the horror of what could have occurred and the terror she must have experienced at impact.  Yes, that experience would shake anyone.\rShe took a step back in confidence that day.  I took a protective step forward to compensate. That was 1997.\rRetired KnitterDaughter and Care Giverretiredknitter@gmail.com"},

{"title": "Through My Care Giver Eyes - August 15, 2011", "date": "Monday, August 15, 2011", "text": "Starting this blog a year ago was for me.  \rFor me the knitter, the friend, the walker, the senior citizen fighting the march of time, the wife, the mother.  To talk about my goals, my interests, my experiences, my ideas about everything.  To blather and to blather. To vent, to share, to create, to question, and to enjoy. \rI wanted to find comfort and contentment in the simple act of living my daily life and find joy in that alone.  \rFor anyone who was paying attention to that litany, you will notice I didn't mention the biggest part of my existence now ... my care giving role for my mother.  Without saying it publicly, however, this blog was also a way of dealing with my ever demanding role as caregiver.  The blog was a way to focus and hold on to all other aspects of my life that I felt were being sucked away by my role as caregiver.  \rIn some regards I have been successful.  And from time to time I have touched on mom's life with me, but superficially.  \rTo tuck away the thoughts and emotions of being a caregiver is to ignore and diminish the biggest and most important part of myself as I am now.  So I choose now to fold you into my world of care giving for an elderly person through a series of postings on this part of my life. \rI am sharing because I need this blog to do as it intended ... \rTo find comfort and contentment in the simple act of living my daily life  as a caregiver and find joy in that alone.\rFor these segments I will turn off the reader's comments.  I am not looking to encourage conversation or public discussion on these periodic postings.  I have found that comments about my caregiver role - whether supportive or critical - have not always been helpful.  And, sadly, I have experienced both. \rIt is the value I place on this role that is my focus.\rAnd for those who are not interested in this topic, you can easily skip past the posts as they occur.  They will always be titled \"Through My Care Giver Eyes\" and dated.  But over the last year I have found friendship and understanding in many of you, so I hope you will follow along with me on this path as well.\rAs always I can be reached privately at the blog email.\rRetired KnitterDaughter and Care Giver\rPS - Despite all the ways I have helped and failed you Mom, I love you!"},
{"title": "Today: Rain, Rest, Random Thoughts", "date": "Sunday, August 14, 2011", "text": "Rainy Day\rToday is one of those gently rainy days and a good day to sit and knit.  Don't know why, but rain is probably my favorite weather.   And I love, love, love walking in the rain.  There is something so settling about being alone with your thoughts and rain.  Sort of like an envelope of privacy that buffers you from all distractions except the \"white noise\" of nature.  Today will be a walk day for sure. And picture taking in the rain is more of a challenge.  I probably don't have the camera to capture such quick moving objects - so when I do there is joy!  \rRest Day\rMy husband celebrated his 65th Birthday yesterday. A big one for sure. We had a small dinner party for family and friends.  No pictures this time - too busy with preparations.  And sometimes the camera is not a welcome guest at a gathering.  This was one of those times.  My husband is not comfortable with pictures so Saturday was a day of rest for my wonderful camera.  Happy Birthday dear husband. \rAnd today ... I rest.  \r\rRandom Thoughts\rThe desire to keep my hands busy with knitting seems to be returning slowly but consistently.  Just like the canary in the mine shaft - the little bird that warns miners that there might be trouble with the air - knitting seems to be my little canary as to how I am doing from the inside out. The fact that this loved hobby is returning, the desire to sit and knit, the joy at producing a knitted project (even a simple hand towel) - all adds up to good signs for me.  I am even thinking of getting my loom out!  Before you know it the spinning wheel will be out too!!  See, the desire is still there!\r\rToday is a no-cook day!  I love no-cook days.  I love left overs!  I love cooking for company, but I love eating left overs when company has gone.  I had help getting the company dinner cleaned up last night (thank you dear daughter), so I didn't get to see inside my refrigerator until this morning when I looked for cream for my coffee.  Wow!  It was totally packed!!  A rather startling sight without any caffeine!  It will be like an archeological expedition day to see what is in the refrigerator. Love it!\rToday will be a blog day.  Need to catch up with all my blog friends.  No sooner do I get my unread posts down to 10 or so, when I miss a day or two and I bounce up to 50 or 60 that are waiting.  But I am not complaining.  An hour or so of reconnecting with you is fun. I need to brainstorm future postings for my blog.  I have developed a pattern of \"brain storming\" ideas, dropping them into draft posts for the future, and then, when I am in a writing mood - fleshing them out and posting.  It works well and it take the pressure off each individual day to \"write something\".\r\rToday is a good, good day!\r\r\r\r\rIts been awhile since I spotlighted my knitting and weaving.\rAnd to my non-knitting readers ... don't click on to the next blog now.  I am a knitter!  It is in my heart and soul even thought I have been \"off the wagon\" for a bit.  This is a major part of who I am.  Stay with me as I show you what my hands have made.\rI finally decided to tie in the ends on these hand towels and use them.  I finished work on these early this year, but for some reason I never made the finishing step. They are no longer languishing in my craft room.\rThese are made from very fine cotton and knitted using two strands.  They are currently housed in my guest bathroom.  \rI love using them.  Can't understand why I didn't finish them off sooner.\r\r\rHere is another hand towel I have finished this week.  It is made from some very expensive cotton.  I love the colors and the feel, but because I spent so much money on the two skeins, I held off using this yarn.  I felt like I should make something to wear, but the right pattern never evolved.\rSo I made a hand towel for the kitchen and I am working on a matching dish cloth.  And I am happy I have used it for these projects.  I will see it far more often in the kitchen than I ever would see it hanging in my closet.\rAnother important element of this picture is the needle.  I am using regular old straight needles ... made of metal ... and pretty unexciting to the ignorant eye!  \rThe needles belonged to my grandmother.  They weren't expensive or trendy, but they are the most special thing in the picture.\rAnd then there are the socks!\rThere were 2 years in the past when I made nothing but socks (over 20 pairs if I remember correctly).  Now I can't seem to get even one pair off the needles.  These lovely green socks will be ready for fall!  I am working on the second sock and I will wear it this winter with its mate ... even if I have to wear them with the knitting needles still attached.\rI will!!\r\r\r\rAnd finally, my weaving.\rI am still making the Weave It squares with my little Weave It loom.  They are my go-to project when I am really off my game (which has been a lot lately).  \rWeave It weaving seems to have caught on with my Tuesday morning knitting group!  There are 3 of us now working on these little looms.\rAnd someday I will have a beautiful blanket to show like my friend HappyOne:-).\rI have a sweater on my needles as well.  But the last time I worked on it was mid-2010.  So it doesn't count.  \rMy projects these days are simple.  In 2009, I made multiple sweaters, many with intricate patterns.  Something happened in 2010 to my knitting mo-jo ... and I am fighting hard to get it back.  These simple projects are moving me back to where I need to be.  \rAfter all, I have 30 years worth of yarn sitting in my basement.  Each and every skein wants my attention!  And my hands are eager to knit ... getting my brain in gear is a challenge."},
{"title": "Ugh!  Dress Shopping", "date": "Saturday, August 13, 2011", "text": "I recently I made a trip to our local mall. I was on an errand for my mom and husband who both needed watch repairs.\rThe watches would be ready in 30 minutes, and I could have sat around and people watched.  \rNot happening.  I am one of the picture people now.\rThere had to be something worthy of my lens in this mall.\r\r\rI hadn't been at the mall in months.  There were changes.\rLooking down from the second level I had a great view of a child's play area sponsored by our local hospital.\rIt was really a colorful and inviting area.  I almost wished I had a kid with me so I could explore it without looking odd.  :-)\r\r\rI am a big fan of Coach bags.  I have owned a few in my past.  I decided to walk into the Coach Store and see what the new styles were.  \rThis purse was quite large, but I was really, really drawn to its style and colors. \rI wasn't drawn to the price - $799.00\rCan you imagine - $800 for a purse? And that doesn't even include the sales tax!!!\rA picture was all I could afford.\r\rAnd then I remembered...I need to shop for a dress! A mother of the groom dress!!small panic feeling ...\r\"Wear whatever you want!!\", the bride has said.  I probably should wear something conservative ... with a nice matching jacket.  A \"motherly style\" comes to mind. *sigh*\rI don't wanna. I want to wear something spring-y, pretty, flowing, feminine!  Something that drapes beautifully and makes me look 20 again.  Ok, maybe that is asking a lot of a dress, but all the rest of it ... I want that! \rAnd so the search began ... not to buy, or even try on, but just to see what the heck they are showing in dresses these days.  After all, the last time a bought a dress (or even wore one) it was sometime in the 90's, it was from L.L.Bean and made of flannel!  :-)  \rUnfortunately this short trip did not ease my anxiety!   You be the judge.\r\r\r\rSo I guess this dress is feminine in a sordid kind of way.\rAnd my future daughter-in-law did say I could wear anything.\rNo, no ... not a good way to start off my relationship with this lovely lady who will be my son's wife.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThis one was flow-y for sure and eye catching in a circus kind of way.\rWith this dress I could ride into the reception on an elephant.  \rOh ... that is right, the mother-of-the-groom is supposed to keep a low profile.  \rGuess the elephant would be too much, and if I can't ride the elephant, I can't have the dress!!\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rAnd this is a dress that screams -\r I am DRESS, hear me roar!\rNo, I don't have the chutzpah to carry this off even if it was marginally appropriate for a wedding.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rAnd this one - well, it is kind of hard to imagine where this would be appropriate.\rSince the skirt was made up of individual scarves tucked in the waist band ... maybe a strip joint???  \rOf course the white blouse was a bit tailored - not the feminine look I was going for.\r\r\r\r\r\r\rAfter a distressing 45 minutes, I scampered back to the shop where I dropped off the watches.\rThey were ready, and so was I ... to go home!\rThis dress shopping was going to be a challenge!  I will need to bring my fashion consultant with me.  My daughter!  She can advise me and carry the tissues I will need to express my frustration. \r(I wonder what my son thinks of flannel?)\rAnd, of course, I will take you along on the dress shopping ride when we do it!!"},

These look like just regular old shoes, but there are prescription orthotics inside each shoe - $400, and the shoes are the best I can buy $150.  So each foot is sporting about $225 dollars. It has been quite a while since I could shop at Pay Less for shoes.\rTake another look at those shoes! Now they look better, don't you think?  :-)\rI haven't walked outside for quite awhile due to the intensely hot weather and poor air quality. My exercise has been limited to Curves and my treadmill.  But ...The day was perfect.  And I realized just how much I missed walking outdoor.  I live in a neighborhood that is about 25 years old.  As a result, much of my walk is deeply shaded, a wonderful benefit of living in an established neighborhood.  \rMy walk takes me past a local pool.  The pool is still open for the season, but in not too long a time the lounge chairs will be permanently packed away for the season.  Mid August for me is the waning days of summer.  Soon school starts and even though official start of Fall is several weeks away, Fall starts for me - with September. But the fruits of the spring plantings and summer waterings are reaching their peak now. In our neighborhood this bed of flowers is one of the few that isn't covered with deer-retardant netting. Deer are a real problem in our area, as most houses back up to a deeply wooded watershed.\rExternal house ornamentation abounds.  Bird houses are everywhere even though I never see a bird taking up residence in one.\rWell ... maybe this trio might house a bird or two.\rI love the colorful \"mushrooms\" that grace one neighbor's yard.Even this spider seems to be making the home stead better.At least she/he doesn't have any grass to water or mow.The morning sun light of late summer is almost perfect."},

Two yearly Mannings events I look forward to are The Spin In in June (this year I was at the hospital with mom - so no spin-in for me), and The Knit In in August.  But more about The Mannings tomorrow.\rThe first part of this beautiful day was the trip itself.  In the past when I traveled I enjoyed having the company of others.  Today I was on my own and it felt freeing.  Just Maxine (my Maxima), my thoughts and me!! \rThe trip is taken almost entirely on 2 lane rural roads - beautiful rolling country side. I passed some beautiful farm property, but getting a picture and driving at the same time proved challenging!  (I think there is a lesson to be learned in that discovery!)  :-)   \rSmall little townships to pass through.\rInteresting community events - a Chili Cook-Off?  How wonderful.\rDecorated homes that are not limited by community guidelines. This house was covered in American Flags.  I thought it was glorious.  Some in my city would say it was over done and attempt to reduce the number of flags.  \rAnd it was Saturday, relatively no traffic.\r\rThis was the last little country road that lead to my destination.  I remember the first time I was down this road ... I couldn't help but wonder if I had taken a wrong turn, surely something this far removed from the main thoroughfare couldn't be successful.  You need to have big signs, be located where passing customers can see you ... \rWrong!\rI had arrived!!"},
{"title": "Two Stories: The Strawberry and The Blueberry", "date": "Monday, August 8, 2011", "text": "We are in the middle of harvest season.  Farmer's Markets abound! Produce of all kinds is at its peak!I dislike summer but I love the products of the season.My blogging friend at The Feathered Nest shared a berry picking story from her childhood!  It was charming. It triggered two berry picking memories of my own - one which was charming and one which  I try to forget - apparently unsuccessfully.The charming one first!The county where I live used to be more rural 30+ years ago.  There were many farms where you could pick your own fruit: peaches, strawberries, blueberries.One of most favorite memories and pictures is one of my daughter dressed in white as a 4 year old.  She went strawberry picking with her mom and picked her way down a row of strawberry plants, eating with gusto. Dressed in white!  What was I thinking when I dressed her in white?She had a good time, though.My second story is not so cute.  In the '80s my mom and I decided to go blueberry picking.  Blueberries are one of my most favorite fruits.  The bushes were chock full of blueberries - and there were a lot of Japanese beetles that year as well.  I remember they were all over the berry bushes and flying around us as we picked.  They were also in my yard. It was a terrible year for Japanese beetles. We had beetle traps set up everywhere to reduce the onslaught of these destructive bugs.But I was not deterred on that berry picking day.  I ignore the pesky beetles.  I just kept picking and picking until we had picked everything we wanted.  We paid for our purchase and went home.  That afternoon I decided to nibble on my haul of blueberries - right out of the bag I brought them home in.  They weren't washed, but I didn't care.  It was no different than eating the berries right off the bush while you were picking, and I had already done that. They were tasty.While I nibbled I watched some TV.  Once in awhile I noticed that some berries were crunchy.  I was engrossed in the TV show and didn't stop nibbling.  At some point I looked in the bag to see how many were left ... and I noticed that some hitch hiker Japanese beetles had made the trip home. And then I remember the crunch!YYYUUUKKKKKKKYYYYY! Yes, I had definitely eaten a few of those beetles.  Gross, gross, gross. Even to this day, if I think of that thought while eating, I want to spit out everything in my mouth.  I still love blueberries, but I can't help from remembering that incident every time I eat them."},
{"title": "Guilty Pleasures", "date": "Sunday, August 7, 2011", "text": "... been thinking about what they are.... was surprised about how many flooded into my brain when I heard those words \"guilty pleasures\" on a pod cast recently.How many guilty pleasures do I have?  If they are guilty ones, could I blog about them?  Could I admit them out loud?So I went out to Wikipedia - the source of all knowledge (not) for a definition.A guilty pleasure is something one enjoys and considers pleasurable despite feeling guilt for enjoying it. The \"guilt\" involved is sometimes simply fear of others discovering one's lowbrow or otherwise embarrassing tastes. Fashion, video games, music,[1] movies[2], and junk food can be examples of guilty pleasures.[3]Lowbrow?  Embarrassing? Guilt? I wish there weren't so many things popping into my mind.  Here are my top 4 - or at least the 4 that I am willing to share:  :-)McDonald Fries - Large size, of course, with lots and lots and lots of salt - bad, bad, bad. At 64 I should have outgrown this \"culinary establishment\".  But their fries are wonderful. No redeeming value, I know.  Even their standing as a vegetable is totally destroyed by the fat and the salt.  But the taste - Yum!  You will notice that I didn't go in and buy a large fries ... for a blog picture or anything.  If I bought them, I would eat them.  As it was I had to hold my breath as I got out of the car to take the picture.  The building smells like fries 100 feet in any direction.  Dancing With the Stars TV Show - I can't stand reality TV, really, none of it.  In my mind much of it is cheap TV.  Most of it is so lame as to rot your brain just by clicking past it on the TV.  But Dancing has something that keeps me watching.  First of all I am quite sure it is not cheap to produce.  And they have first line entertainers on it.  Fun dancing, great music, magnificent costumes, many laughs, cheering for your favorite, unexpected injuries and personal dramas, growth and improvement of some contestants, suspense wondering who is going to be chopped this week ... it has it all.  But when I admit I like this show publically ... why do I sometimes feel like I am slumming? Do you think my brains are rotting?Caramel Apples - I am not talking about Candy Apples - those are an abomination, a fake, a waste of calories!  I am talking about the apples with the thick, rich, gooey caramel that covers every part of the apple skin and drips down the stick a bit  - sometimes with nuts but they can be bare of all other toppings and still be divine.  An apple is healthy treat, but oh soooo much better with caramel smeared all over it.   And I am sure the calorie count is not as much as Cheese Cake or a Big Mac (or Cheese Cake smeared on a Big Mac).   :-)   Fall isn't Fall for me unless I have one of these delicious delights.  Who am I kidding ... one? A vacation by myself - a month at the beach by myself would do me. No one to cook for, no chores, no schedule, blessed silence except for the waves crashing on the shore and the sea gulls squawking.  No phone, no TV ... just a book, my knitting, my iPod Touch, my laptop and my iPad.  Fries for breakfast, a Caramel Apple for lunch and Cheese Cake smeared on a Big Mac for dinner!  I've never done this before - go on a vacation all by myself - but if I could I would.  Of course, I would feel bad because I know even a week away would put a big burden on a lot of people I care about. Sometimes I am embarrassed even by the thought of this selfish desire.  The stomach ache from my yummy diet would be justified for being so selfish.  So, now it is your turn!Will you name one of your guilty pleasures for everyone to read?  Come on ... I dare you!"},

Nah ....   :-)Thanks, Julie.In receiving this adorable award (did you see how very cute the dog is?), I was asked to recommend a book that I am reading.  Well ... I am just thrilled to do that. I just joined Audible and my first audiobook is Book 1 in the series The Game of Thrones by George R. R. Martin.  This is a massive series best described by Booklist in a single sentence.\"The first volume in Martin's first fantasy saga combines intrigue, action, romance, and mystery in a family saga.\" (Booklist)I also understand that HBO is filming this series.  I love historic stories, books, movies ... costume dramas are my very favorite.I know it is appropriate to pass these awards along to others, mostly as a way of sharing the blog sites of wonderful bloggers to others.I want to pass this award on to a reader friend of mine.  She keeps a running list of books she is reading on her blog.  I am sure you will find some fun titles there.So with no more ado ... I pass this award onto my blogger friend, my knitting friend, a walker extraordinary, the one who inspired me to start my own blog, a great reader, and who  is actually  seriously cute!HappyOne is her blogger name and her happy outlook on life can raise your spirits.Find her at:Life is Good"},

The Irresistibly Sweet Blog Award!I am not sure she knows me very well.  :-)   Oh that is right!  She can only see me through my blog!Anyway, I am pleased she thought of me.  Thank you, mybabyjohn.Awards usually have rules ... there are 3 rules for this award.Link back to the person who gave you the award - you really need to check out her blog. The link is above.  I am a regular there ... but I am wearing my company face when I am there ... the sweet face.   :-)List 7 unknown facts about yourself - hmmm, this is harder, will take some timePass the award on to 5 others - I have a new personal spin on this.The seven unknown  facts.I am not sweet.  That apparently is not well known.  :-)I am irresistible.  You would be amazed at how many people don't know that.I would love to spend a year living in Alaska to experience the full scope of weather and the 24 hours of day and night.  I think my husband was the only one who knew that and he said \"Forget it!\"I like animals better than most people. When I told a friend of mine that fact, he said sounds like you have been disappointed by people.  Well ... yes!I could vacation in a tree house!  Doesn't that sound grand?  That wasn't an invitation.  I want to do it by myself.I can't stand ditherers.  If it takes you more than an hour to make a decision, don't tell me about it. I have inherited some genuine artistic talent from my father's side of the family that is not developed.  I hope when I get to the Pearly Gates, God isn't too mad at me. Pass it On to 7 OthersI have decided that for each award I get, each award I pass on ... I will pass it on to only one person. Hope that isn't a problem.  I think picking one blogger out of your blog contacts makes the selection more special. I pass this award to Melissa at: Life of a Honey Bee.  I have followed her blog for awhile and she is genuinely sweet, just as sweet as her blog title suggests.  You need to give her a visit."},
{"title": "X Marks the Spot - the Joliprint Spot", "date": "Thursday, August 4, 2011", "text": "I found the exact post that explained the Joliprint options -  Follow the X.For those who care to wander through what is available for Blogspot, once at The Blog Designers Network site:Select Tutorials.Select Blogger.Page down through numerous posts.  Most of it involves actual coding changes - which I am not particularly interested in.  But if you page down far enough you come to December 16, 2010, the date of the post on Joliprint. I thought their Joliprint tutorial was very good.  And it is short - easy to follow. But the Joliprint site was easy to use as well.  I am not technically skilled.  If I can do it, everyone can do it.When I have the time, I might see if there are any other blogger posts of interest to me.Somehow I was directed to a blog site called The Blog Designers Network. This site looks interesting and may contain the answers to many questions regarding blogging.  I was unable, however, to find my way back to their December 2010 postings where I found this little gem. Their description of this printing option was excellent.The December post recommended Joliprint - a free service that allows you to add a Blogspot gadget to your blog or a link in your Book Mark Bar.  Using this service you create a pdf document of individual blog posting or any screen print you select.  I chose the Book Mark Bar option.   Having this option as a book mark allowed me to make pdf of other things as well, like a recipe from someone else's blog.The pdf captures the header, the titles, the pictures, the blog text in a clean simple color presentation.  You can then print the document off your computer ... basically for the cost of your paper and the ink.  Your choice whether to delete or maintain the pdf copies on your computer.  I haven't decided on that yet.This option works well for me.  It will take time to print out all that I have written. As I sort through my postings I may skip some, but it does exactly what I want it to do.  And, as suggested by one of my readers, if Blogspot fails at some point or my computer goes belly up - at least I will have my hard copies.Check out both sites.  Tell me what you think.  I am very interested in your observations."},
{"title": "Picking your brains", "date": "Thursday, August 4, 2011", "text": "Question #1 - Has anyone ever tried to print out hard copies of their blog?  I am interested in doing exactly this with my blog.  I checked one site called Blog2Print. It seemed pretty expensive to me.  One quote for printing out my blog entries and pictures only from July to December 2010 was for $85.00.  This cost would produce a paperback bound book with no readers comments - just blog text and pictures.  If I included readers' comments, it would have gone over $100.  Now that I have a whole year behind me, the cost would be pretty expensive.  I wasn't sure if someone had done this and found a more reasonable way of doing it.  I am open to all suggestions - even a simple suggestion of doing some kind of a screen print on my computer.Some may be wondering why I want to do this.  I know this will date me in the eyes of some, but electronic copies of anything - my blog, my pictures ... anything - never feels like \"real\" copies to me.  Since I have put a year of my life into this blog ... and anticipate doing many more years, I want to generate a hard copy.  Does anyone else feel that way?Question #2 - Do you know this face? Look closely.  American citizens should know right off.  Why yes, you are right.  That is Benjamin Franklin - well, the German Steinbach Nutcracker version of old Ben. I have a decent size collection of imported nutcrackers. I long ago stopped collecting them.  And now I find as we are cleaning out and simplifying our living space, I no longer want to display them.  At present I am creating a picture inventory of them and then packing the collection away.  I have not decided yet if I will keep them or not.  But I will not just give them away like I did with so much other stuff over the last year.Now for the question: Are you aware of any sites that are good places to sell these kinds of collectibles should I decide to move them on to new homes.  I have checked eBay ... not sure that is the right audience."},
{"title": "So now I am retired", "date": "Wednesday, August 3, 2011", "text": "I know. I know.I skipped a whole bunch of years.  But as you move closer to the present, my life mirrors the lives of many.  Jobs, kids activities, vacations, family events, holidays, disappointments and challenges, hobbies, your first home, friends ... you know what all that looks like.My retirement, though, is not what I thought it would be for a number of reasons.We didn't anticipate medical surprises ... like my husband's decreasing vision.  We didn't know that we would be caregivers for 3 elderly relatives.  We didn't expect that being professionally successful as we were, we would find ourselves laid off from our jobs ... yes, we were both laid off around the same time in our late 50's,  not the best time to get re-employed even in an up economy. This is not an exhaustive list of the unexpected ... but it is what I can share.  Life throws you curve balls, and you just do the best you can to catch them and move on.  Our lives have been blessed in so many ways.  I hope I made that apparent in my brief blog posts of my past.  To list all the positives would be more than this blog could hold.I have enjoyed doing this romp through my history but I discovered a very disturbing fact ... I have way too many pictures that are in total disarray in the basement.  To give you the scope ... I have the pictures we took (and there were tons), the pictures we inherited from my husband's grandmother, and his father, and his stepmother, and his mother, and let's not forget the pictures mom brought with her when she moved in with us. There are also a lot of historic family documents that need better care.  The volume pictures and documents is breath-taking in its scope. And I am now the caregiver for that history.So although I am done posting old pictures to the blog (for now), I am going to get serious about getting all that stuff in the basement organized and mounted.  It was one of my goals for my next 20 years and I have made very little progress.Thanks for all the kinds comments regarding my pictures and stories.  This was fun for me too. And it is important to look back at where you came from periodically, to take an account of what and who made you ... you, and reflect with gratitude on the many hands that helped you along the way.I am grateful."},
{"title": "I always wanted kids!", "date": "Tuesday, August 2, 2011", "text": "... and I got it in my head that I must have them before I turned 30!Of course, now-a-days, the trend is to have your children in your 30s.  I don't know if that is a generational fad or the result of economic realities. Probably the latter.  I also wanted to stay home to raise them.  That was hard for two reasons: it meant living on one salary - half of what we were used to, and I missed working - a lot. But we managed.  We didn't have all the bells and whistles that our working friends had. We didn't own a single family home or drive fancy cars.  Money was tight all the time.  But my husband and I didn't come from financially comfortable homes when we were single so it wasn't such a large step back for us at the time.I blogged about these two wonderful people who are my kids on their birthdays during the last year - here for my son, and here for my daughter.  There is so much more to say.I hit the jack pot with both kids. They have grown into adults who I love, admire and respect. They are responsible productive adults. They hold strong opinions on the value of family relationships.  They are there for me when I need a helping hand.  You can't ask for more than that in the children you raise. The world is a better place with them in it ... especially for me.Here are a few other pictures that tell the story of their growing up more eloquently than any words of mine.There are many things I would do differently if I lived my life over.  Having kids is not one of those things ...  I knew in my core I would be a mom!And if I had been given the opportunity in advance to select the two individuals who would be my kids, I would have chosen exactly these two."},
{"title": "First pics!!!", "date": "Monday, August 1, 2011", "text": "So my mom got a new digital camera.  Here I am with the box.  It is a Cannon PowerShot SX230 HS, whatever that is.  I am not wild about this flashy thing she likes to do, but based on how she has been lately without it, I guess I should consider myself lucky I am even in the shot at all.Hey mom, how about a shot of just me??That's better.  No stupid card board box in the photo. Just my handsome face!Woww - that is too close. You can see all my wrinkles.My dog cousins won't be happy about the return of Flashy Grandma!!Love to allWallyXXOOA note from the photographer:  I don't know how many of you a familiar with the Broadway musical called Sweeney Todd.  Briefly this is the story of a barber who was wrongly sent to prison and his family destroyed by a bad guy.  When released he begins the journey of getting even with the bad guy that stole his life.  One of the things he finds is his original barber tools - one of which is a very long threatening knife-like scalpel that he uses to shave the hair off men's faces - and which he now uses to slit the throats of customers since he has gone revenge crazy (it is a dark story but excellent - with meat pies made from the customers he kills - waste not want not, you know).There is a song where he rejoices at the fact he is finally reunited with his scalpel, lifting it high above his head - declaring most dramatically and emphatically that his arm is now whole again!What does all that have to do with me and my camera??That's right ... With camera in hand my arm is now whole again ... There are, however, no sharp edges.Love to all,Flashy Grandma and Power ShotMy husband and I were engaged to be married for 2 years.  I met him when I was a Sophomore in college, he asked me to marry him on our third date (my response then: \"You don't know me that well\"), and engaged to be married within 3 months of our first date.  So a longish engagement made sense.  But it was long mostly because of my dad.  He was not in favor of me going to college and said I was going just to meet a future husband. Well, that is in fact what happened, but I was determined to graduate first.  No getting married and dropping out of college for me. Our wedding was small and simple: a short ceremony at our local church and a buffet lunch at a popular event location.  We had about 75 guests.  The was no limos to take us from one place to another, no music beyond what was piped in by the restaurant,  and no dancing.  I don't remember throwing the bouquet or the garter.  There was no open bar.  We did have a wedding cake, we did do the \"cut the cake\" thingy and feed each other.  I think a few toasts were made. This first picture shows me with my dad at home before we left for the church.  This is about 18 months before he died from a fall at work.  I remember he was nervous and was struggling to resist having a drink to settle his nerves. I don't ever remember him in a suit.  So when I saw him dressed up in a white Tux I remember thinking how handsome he looked.  It is a picture that I like a lot.  I am glad he lived long enough to take part in one of life's joys of being the Father of the Bride.  It is how I like to remember him.After the procession down the isle my dad handed me off to my future husband.  There was a near catastrophe just moments after this picture was taken.  You see my dad had poor vision with big coke-bottle lenses in his glasses. Visually he was limited.  Just as I took my fiance's hand and stepped toward the alter, my dad stepped behind me heading for the pew.  Apparently he missed stepping on the short train of my dress by a fraction of an inch.  I heard some people gasp as we walked forward, but I never turned around to see what caused the concern.  Some things are better not known.Here we are in the reception line.  Clearly we were both glad to have gotten past the ceremony.I was very thin then. I bought the size 6 dress off the rack and had it altered down to a size 4.  That was the last time I saw a size 4 on this body!!  Most brides lose some weight before the wedding, either intentionally or due to nerves. Neither was the case for me. I was just terribly thin growing up.  I really didn't gain any normal weight until after I was married and had left the stress of living at home behind me. The photography was a gift from the Best Man. We were thrilled because it was an expense we didn't need to incur.  Unfortunately, the photographer sent a colleague on the day of the event and this colleague was not as experienced or skilled.  Many of the pictures were terribly done or over exposed.  Most of the best shots came from the guests who brought their own cameras.  So we never had a traditional wedding album.  But we have enough pictures to remember the event.  Obviously wedding pictures don't insure a successful marriage.  It is what happens after that day that makes or breaks the relationship.Our honeymoon was modest as well.  We spent 4 days in Williamsburg, Virginia.  It still is one of our favorite places to visit.In this day and age of elaborate, expensive weddings and honeymoons to far off, exotic locations, our experience was tame.  I think it was tame by the standards of that time as well.I kind of feel that the mega sized weddings of today are more a sign of our culture than anything else ... like the jumbo houses that people buy but really can't afford, super sized restaurant meals that no can eat all of, rental storage units to house all the stuff we bought but can't fit into our house ... it is that kind of thinking has permeated the process of getting married.  Bigger is better.  More is better.If I had it to do all over again, I would pick the same kind of wedding I had 42 years ago.  I wouldn't change thing.   Oh ... I might change one thing - no high heel shoes!!"},

Since it was under warranty I could get a new camera of equal value.  They still sell my old camera (it was only 8 months old), but they were out of stock, so I bought the next camera up and it cost me only $30 ... the difference in value between the two cameras. I am pleased.:-)So I am going to take a few days to get familiar with it - shouldn't take too long.  And then, we are off and running again on the blogging picture trail!!I have gotten into a blogging routine ... finally ... after a year! Some of us are slow learners.My day usually starts around 6:30 am (today was 5:30 am because 3 grand dogs wanted to go for a walk - can't they tell time???) *sigh*  ... the day begins with a cup of coffee and my laptop.  I would give you a picture, but my camera is vacationing in Geek Land (still!!).  I spend the first quiet hour of the day reading blogs.  It is my own quiet me-time.  Everyone is asleep.  Usually that first hour I am not awake enough to do anything else but sip coffee and read.  That first hour gives my body time to catch up with my brain.  And I try hard to not write stuff until after the coffee has been absorbed by my cells.  My words without caffine can be dreadfully confusing - almost another language.Periodically during the day I will check email to see if anyone has visited my blog and commented. Now you visitors who don't comment (you know who you are) ... how do I know that you came for a visit?  Yes, I know, there are blogspot stats that let me know the number of visitors to each post, but without comments you are \"lurking\" ... I need you to comment and say \"hi\".  \"Hi\" is good!! The door is always open to my \"blog house\".  Stop peaking in the window and come on in!!Come evening I get another hour just before bed ... another hour of me-time.  Everyone else has zonked out for the night (cats, dogs, mother, daughter, husband) and it is just me, my laptop and maybe a glass of wine and a hunk of cheese.  That is when I create blog postings.  The cheese makes me creative and the wine makes me wordy!  It is a good combination. Sometimes I just drop ideas into draft postings for the future, sometimes I create the guts of a single posting, sometimes I read what I wrote previously tweaking it (it is amazing what crap I can write - you don't want to see an \"un-tweaked post\"), and sometimes I just schedule a number of finished postings for future days (I so love the \"schedule\" feature.) So what is your blogging routine?  Do you have a routine?  How do you squeeze this sometimes time-consuming process into your day?"},
{"title": "Teacher Teacher", "date": "Saturday, July 30, 2011", "text": "Graduating from College with a degree in Education sort of predisposes you to teaching, I guess.I never thought much about teaching before entering college. Sadly it wasn't a life long goal.  What I wanted was go to college, and my parents pressured me to pick a major that would get me a job ... like Nursing, Teaching, ... uhh ... at the time I felt like those were my only choices.  My parents wouldn't have paid for a Degree in Theatre Arts - and in hindsight I can see that a degree in performance arts wouldn't have paid the bills.  When you live at the lower end of the income spectrum - practicality must rule. Taking time to explore my options was a luxury I didn't have.  Nursing?  I wasn't prepared from high school for college level science or math so Nursing was out.  Teaching it was.  My degree was selected by default!  What I discovered was that I had a hidden gift to teach!  My first years as a teacher were for Second Graders - 7 to 8 year olds.  I enjoyed it, but teaching children wasn't my gift. I left classroom teaching after 4 years to raise a family.  When I returned to the work force in non-teaching jobs, I fell into teaching roles - new employee orientation, adult trainer, mentoring.  I did some form of adult teaching all my work life.  My gift was teaching adults ... and I have heard that observation repeated back to me many times. Still, if I had it to do all over again, I wouldn't pick teaching, but the knowledge and skills I learned from those years have served me well.  Here are two pictures of my time in the class room. This first picture is my student teaching year. I am on the far left - standing next to the top row of students.  On the far right is my mentoring teacher, Mrs. Miller.  Mrs. Miller was 73 years old at the time and that was her last year of teaching.  I was asked to return to the school the next year to take her place.  No one could take her place.  She was a wonderful teacher and mentor, but I was in the right place at the right time.  I got the job.This last picture is one of 4 classes I had during my time at this school.  I chose this year to show you specifically because of my outfit ... very 70's - a bold, ugly plaid pant suit.  Whatever was I thinking?:-)The question still remains ... if there were no pressures and time to decide what my major would be ... at 64 I still have no idea!  The College Degree opened employment doors over my whole working career.  I got the college experience which I wanted, and I got the benefits of having the piece of paper."},

I didn't go to prom.  I wasn't part of any highly regarded club or student government.  I wasn't college bound.  I wasn't traditionally pretty or popular, I struggled academically, I wasn't stylish (money was an issue), my mom wouldn't let me wear make up until I was 16  or shave my legs until I was 18. I looked so much younger than everyone else, but in high school looking more mature was very important. I had to take public bus transportation with a transfer in the middle of the trip for my senior year (we had moved out of the county at the beginning of my senior year so I was sort of illegally attending the high school.)It was a gigantic high school.  There were about 1,000 students in my graduating class alone, and the other classes were just as large.   It was easy to \"get lost\" in the mobs of students.  I know, I know. From the perspective of approximately 50 years later these are not life-shattering things. But layered on top of a dysfunctional family life ... I remember it as a pretty heavy burden to bear.In my Senior Year in High School things changed. You see, at that time I wanted to be an Actress! (figured ... I would be more interested in make believe than real life.)  I was taking Drama classes in a high school with a regional reputation for exceptional quality theatrical productions.  I was lucky.  Today the school is a magnetic school for the performing arts.   Goldie Hawn (Actress) and Connie Chung (News Anchor) were both graduates of that high school.  Performance history runs very deep in that school.In my Senior year I cheekily tried out for the Senior Class Play.  This play was one of two major theatrical productions each year. That year the play was Our Town.  I auditioned for the part of Emily, the female lead.  Clearly, based on everything I said above, I had no chance of getting the part.  I remember at try-outs I had a sinking sensation in my stomach.  I watched all the beautiful, popular girls audition for the part of Emily.  They all delivered their lines exactly the same - like they had discussed the exactly right way to do the part in their cliquey groups.  Ironically I had planned to do exactly the same presentation in my audition.  But in that moment changed my approach.  I used different inflections, rhythm, pauses, blocking.  I was going to be noticed!!!A week later I walked up to the bulletin board outside the drama department to check the list of cast members. There was a large group of students clustered around trying to do the same thing.  I had to squeeze between students to get close enough to read the cast list.  And it took me probably a full 5 minutes for the message my eyes were reading to be recognized by my brain. My name was listed for the female lead!  And once my mind accepted what was written, I don't think I would have believed it except for the congrads of other students around me as I stood there stunned. I remember one thought that popped into my head at the time:  \"What have I done?\"  :-)If I had known what the day had in store for me, I would have insisted on shaving my legs!  :-)And so, here are some grainy pictures from my yearbook of the performance.  The first is me at the beginning of the play, alive and well and getting married.And below is me dead.  I look pretty good for dead, don't you think?  For those who don't know the play Our Town, the message of the play is to love your life, every minute of it.  In this scene Emily has died and is with others who are also dead in the town grave yard.   The town is gathered at her grave site. The dead behind me have over time become totally disinterested in the ways of the living.  But Emily who is newly dead (you know that because I am wearing white.)  :-)  ...  Emily can still remember how wonderful life is-was, and how sad that the living don't see that.That play was the beginning of change for me.  I started hanging around with the Drama in-crowd. Now I was \"in\" too.  Most of the Drama crowd was heading to college.  So I decided I wanted to go to college too (this would have been about December of my senior year).  I was not prepared academically or financially to do this, and by today's standards deciding to go to college 6 months before graduation from high school is just not done ... but I wasn't getting hung up on the sniggly details.  Life can just pass you by if you get tripped up by details.I had one Year Book from high school - my senior year. We couldn't afford for me to have the others.  The book was filled with well wishes from tons of students and teachers.  I think that momentary desire to stand out from the in-crowd  in that audition changed the course of my life in a large way.  But the questions I often ponder are the \"what ifs\".What if ...mom had not supported my desire to stay in my current high school for my senior year.I hadn't auditioned for a play I had no chance of getting a part in.I hadn't gotten ornery and decided to be \"different\" on purpose during my audition.Mom wasn't willing to pick me up every school night after play practice at 9:30 pm  for 3 months.I hadn't spent time with college-bound students and changed my mind about going to college.Mom hadn't (after picking herself off the floor) supported my wish to go to college and found the way to pay for it - because there were no scholarships for me, no family inheritances, no extra money just laying around.  This had to have been tough for her.All I can say is two things ...I believe completely in the message of Our Town. Life is wonderful and we should enjoy every single minute.and, Thanks mom!"},

We are working diligently to complete the job as quickly as possible – no action on your part is necessary. We'll contact you as soon as the product is complete and ready for pickup.We're on it. Things will be better soon.Geek Squad\"Things will be better soon.\" How do they know I am having adjustment problems?!?!  Is there no privacy in this world anymore or am I just paranoid? (Rhetorical question - no need to respond.):-)The absence of my camera has been interesting.  I have had my moments of dismay at not having my camera.  For example:My daughter and I went bridal dress shopping with my future daughter-in-law.  I would have loved to share that with you.  I wouldn't show the dress she picked, of course, but maybe just tease you with pictures of the lace and stuff. It was a fun time and I am very upset about my lack of pictures.  I may share our adventure without pictures, but pictures make it so much better.My grand-dogs have been extra extra special cute.  I know they are just teasing me because Grandma isn't pointing the \"flashy box\" thingy at them all the time now. Don't get used to it boys ... the camera \"will be back.\"I finally get out to dinner with friends and my husband (you know, pretending to be a grown up and \"playing\" with adults without my mom), and I don't have my camera. *sigh*On the upside, I have totally enjoyed selecting the older pictures and reminiscing.  Don't get me wrong or anything, but I was damn cute!!!  I got less cute as I got older.  It is tough to peak at age 7 in your looks.  Its all downhill from there.  :-)But I am eager to share some other stuff I have uncovered and remembered.  I have my high school years coming up - who doesn't have something interesting to share about that time.  I plan to share some of my wedding pictures too - memories of that day. And, of course, a bit of my time as a young wife and mother.You know, people always complain about growing older. That is just plain wrong, wrong, wrong!! Think on it ... all the life you would have missed if you hadn't grown older and had the time to experience life. I remind mom of that fact frequently when she gets frustrated with her ill health.  She has lived to 85 (so far), and Dad died in his 50s.  Think of all the things he missed!  I know for a fact that he wanted a son, so missing out on his grandson was a HUGE loss!  I celebrate every year I have lived - grateful, grateful, grateful.  And bring on more years!!!  I am really looking forward to moving through the past years with you while we wait for my camera to return - like in 12 days, but who is counting!!! Not me."},
{"title": "The Girl Scout and the Daughter", "date": "Wednesday, July 27, 2011", "text": "I did my time at being a girl scout!  I wasn't a ardent girl scout, but the choices of organized activities for kids wasn't so great then as it is today. I still have my sash with the badges that I am wearing in this picture, but since my stupid camera is broken I cannot provide the picture proof (13 days).But I have something even more special from that time than a girl scout sash ... a hand written note from my father to me.I should explain about my father.Dad died in 1970.  He was an alcoholic.  As is typical for the family members of alcoholics, we didn't share that fact publicly.  It was something you hid.  And you made excuses to cover that fact that you couldn't have sleep overs or any other typical kids-focused activities at your house.  I didn't think of it as so unusual at the time because I grew up with those normal pieces always missing from my life.  You don't miss something you didn't have in the first place.His disease did not impact the supervisory job he held until his death ... it impacted only his family.  And even to this day when we are more enlightened about this disease, I wasn't sure what to share and what to avoid in giving this information. But for you to understand just how special the hand written note from my father was ... you need to know the back story.And the back story is that when he was sober he was the most charming, loving, warm father you could ever want.  I have those wonderful memories along with the ugly ones. So when you read this note - this was the man my mom fell in love with and had children with.  The \"other\" man had an illness that was not well understood at the time.One other thing ... he wasn't an educated person. He finished school, but his interest wasn't in learning or reading.  I don't believe he had any interests outside of his job.  We have nothing else of his.  He had no collections or cherished possessions with which to remember him.  What I have inherited are mostly memories - and many of those are filled with unhappiness.  But I have this letter, and it is a reminder that all people are multifaceted.  This letter allows me to remember his good side and that he loved his family.And so ... Dad always left for work very early in the morning, before we were out of bed.  The morning he wrote this note and left it for me, he was responding to a stack of items on the kitchen table that I was going to take on a Girl Scout camping trip that day.  He mentions Lucky who was our dog at the time. To stop and write this note was something way out of the ordinary for him.The paper has not withstood the test of time very well.  It is yellowed and split at one of the folds.  I am sure Dad used some dime store pad that was just laying around in the kitchen. But the words and the emotions expressed still resonate with me 41 years after his death.  It was a message to just me, and it was not tarnished by alcohol.Thanks, Dad."},
{"title": "Now we are 4!", "date": "Tuesday, July 26, 2011", "text": "Early years as a Maryland resident included some pretty large events for a 7 year old child.My sister was born in 1954. I remember mom waving to me from the hospital window after my sister was born - children visitors were not allowed.  I clearly remember my first view of my sister. Sitting in the back seat of our car at the hospital entrance, Mom got into the front seat with my sister in her arms.  I leaned over mom's shoulder asking to see the baby. The blanket was pulled away and the largest dark brown eyes I'd ever seen were staring back at me.  She had dark hair and an olive complexion.  She definitely favored dad from her earliest days.I began first grade - for the second time!  In New York City they let students enter first grade mid-year - for me in January.  In September Maryland wouldn't recognize a half year of first grade.  I was never a great student in grade school, so it was probably a good choice.  If I had started second grade, I would have been so much younger than everyone else and I would have been missing some basic skills.I developed my first neighborhood friendships - one of which has lasted my life time. Here is a picture of me on a swing in the playground right outside our bedroom windows. The building is located right behind me.  The playground was a magnet for all the neighborhood children. And I imagine it was great for mom.  She could look right outside the bedroom windows to check on me.  I love this picture because it shows me pretty well decked out in my dress coat and purse.  I love the purse!! I wonder what I had in it.  I have no memory of ever being dressed up but obviously I did.Countdown clock: 14 days!"},
{"title": "Maryland - our first  home was ...", "date": "Monday, July 25, 2011", "text": "... a motel room off Route 1 in College Park shown in this post card. Back then they called these motel rooms \"cabins\" or cottages.  I think the term \"motel\" became more common later.This place was called Haass' Haven.  The back of the post card has this description: \"On U.S Route 1, 10 miles North of the Nation's Capital. Modern Cabins, Shower or Bath in each.  P.O. Address: 8419 Baltimore Avenue, Berwyn, Maryland.  Phone Tower 6691.  Mr. and Mrs. Carl Haass, Owners.\"  Too funny.  Shower or Bath in each ... I guess not too long ago there were outhouses.In my mind, the area seemed very green and lovely ... almost country, and maybe in the 1950s Route 1 was mostly green.  Of course, I was coming from New York City, even alittle grass was \"very green\" to me. The motel I think stands today but is seedy looking as you would expect after 60 years.  That whole area is now built up with uncontrolled and random development.We came to Maryland in the summer. This picture was taken in July 1951.  I was 4 years old. I don't think we made a permanent move to Maryland until I was almost 6, but the details of that time are spotty.  It must have been warm because I remember the heat and humidity (probably hotter than New York) and in this picture I am in a sun dress.  I also remember a small plastic pool Mom had for me to cool off in outside while we lived in the motel. No air conditioning then.Later we moved to a second floor apartment in a large brick development. We never lived in our own home, always in apartments or rental units.  More on our apartment living next time.~~~~~~~~~15 days until my camera comes home, but who is counting!"},

And a count down is in progress.   16 days!Anyway, I found two pictures that I took when my camera was working. I've been saving them for a \"rainy day\".  Today is the day. (Technically, there is not a drop of moisture outside that hasn't been sucked up by extreme humidity and blistering 100 degree heat ... but when your camera is broken and you are a blogger  ... it is a rainy day. Trust me on this.)So here is the back story to this picture.  I visited my grand dogs' vet to buy some dog food. Both are on vet grade dog food.  (Grandmothers buy their own equipment and food. It is sort of like a grandmother rule.)  Anyway, as I was waiting, an old man came in and dropped a dog bed on the floor in the waiting room. Walking slowly behind him was this old Pug.  The Pug seemed to be \"seeing\" his way with his nose to his bed. Needless to say, I couldn't just ignore the fact that a very old Pug had just arrived.  I was compelled to ask questions.  Apparently, Mr. Twizzles is 15 years old.  The owner, who was pretty rickety himself, was bringing his dog in for boarding for a week. Mr. Twizzles is both deaf and blind!  His nose, however, still works.  Once he found his bed, he curled up and settled in.  Now I tell you!! When my grand dogs are old, they will NEVER EVER come to a strange place to spend a week - especially if they are blind and deaf.  NEVER EVER!!The vet  staff assured me that Mr. Twizzles has been here before and that as long as he has his bed (and his food and his bone), he is happy.  So did someone ask him if he was happy?  And did he respond?  And if he is deaf, would he have even heard the question???  Hmph!Mr. Twizzles doesn't have a Grandmother - obviously!! But doesn't that face just melt your heart?  I know it melted mine.  If I didn't have 3 dogs waiting at home for me that day, Mr. Twizzles would have been boarding with me for that week.  (Technically, my husband who is a cat person probably would have had a problem with that arrangement ... but, well, I know ... if he saw that face ....)"},
{"title": "Scorcher", "date": "Saturday, July 23, 2011", "text": "It is a scorcher out there.In keeping with my recent \"looking back\" posts - I just want to make a few unsettling observations.Looking back ...I think the weather generally has gotten hotter, colder, more bazaar, and more extreme in the last 15 years or so.  When looking at the historical ebbs and flows of the earth we inhabit, these changes are not the most extreme in its history.  But, since earth's geologic and meteorologic changes occur very, very slowly - over thousands and hundreds of thousands of years - it is a bit disconcerting to be aware of changes that span just 15 years!!Red and Orange Air Quality Alerts are a relatively new phenomena - probably in the last 15 years or so.  I don't remember having problems breathing during the heat of summer prior to the early 1990s.  Maybe it is because I am 20 years older, but I doubt it. I don't remember TV and radio cautions being broad casted to the public telling the elderly and young children to stay in doors prior to the 1990s. I figure this isn't just about how my 64 year old body is reacting to the atmosphere. I do not believe that any one scientific group is any more in the know than another group of experts on what is actually happening to the weather.  I do believe that the scope of our human scientific knowledge on our earth and its atmosphere is infantile compared to what we have left to learn.How much of this current situation is man-made and how much is part of a natural earth cycle of change is the subject of much public discussion. But I do know that the earth's cycles are not in tens of years ... tens of years are just micro seconds in the earth's clock.  So something is different ... Makes you wonder.So lets hear from you.  Which camp are you in?Mankind made this mess so man needs to fix it.The Earth is cycling through climate change.  Us little peons need to stop being so full of ourselves and adjust to what Mother Nature has delivered.I think it is a mix of both.I have no idea. I just hope my air conditioner doesn't break.Other - explain yourself!"},

How much of that was due to my grandmother's personality vs my father's personality ... is unknown.  Gram was French/German and Dad was Cjeck/Polish.  They probably butted heads at times.In this picture was  taken in Astoria, New York right outside our apartment (September 1951) when I was 4 years old.  It probably was taken within a year of our move.  My most vivid memory of this time was learning to roller skate.  I clearly remember the feeling of rolling uncontrollably down a city sidewalk with increasing speed while a parent or an aunt walked quickly backwards in front of me, arms outstretched waiting to catch me if I fell. Terror is usually a memory of note - even at 4!Another memory is of Thanksgiving.  We celebrated this holiday several times at my Great Aunt Grace and Great Uncle Otto's apartment in New York City. In this picture (1949) I am 2, but it was repeated enough that the memory stuck.  The remember the room being filled with a lot people. I also remember the curved arched doorways.  Seeing this picture I now see that the room was very small. I think the dining room table was set up in the living room - probably the biggest room of those tiny apartments. To a small child it must have seemed like a crowd. :-)Memories of my childhood become more complete after we moved to Maryland."},
{"title": "Distance Memories", "date": "Thursday, July 21, 2011", "text": "How far back can you remember?  Sorting through the pictures of my distant past I am sometimes surprised.For example, I don't remember this picture (1947) - no surprise there!  I would assume only geniuses or savants would remember anything prior to their first birthday.I don't remember this picture (1948) either - too young, but the woman is my Aunt Phebe who I blogged about previously.  She is just as I remember her - a beautiful, warm and loving person.I remember a small bit of this picture (1950) at 3 years old.  The photographer had placed my hands just so on the fake board.  I remember him messing with my fingers and being asked to hold that position.  I also remember my mom put my hair in pin curls to make it look like that.No memories of this picture (1950) - with Santa holding a Candy Cane just out of reach!  I'd like to see him try that now!!Pictures can prompt memories further back than you might suspect.  I am so glad to find these pictures tucked away with mom's stuff.  It also prompted the desire to print out some hard copies of pictures that I now have saved on my computer.  Years and years from now, would someone have access to my electronic copies if they were curious?Doubtful.In so many ways photo albums seem like a thing of the past, but so much past would be lost if electronic copies are lost or technology changes or fails.  I have stored many pictures in the last 10 years on my computer.  Time to print out some hard copies for future albums."},

I had no preconceived likes or dislikes.  I felt like a sponge absorbing everything. I could count about 6 people who might be interested enough to read what I wrote (and they would do it as a favor, I was sure).  And I was interested in blogs with hundreds of followers. The bigger the better.I was sure that whatever I wrote would be warmly received, I would be very interesting to the world at large (I have no clue as to why I thought that - and secretly I still think this),   :-)   and ... well, as I said before ... it is all about me! Doesn't that sound like the immature 5 year old who lives next door? That would be me!In a year I have refined my preferences.  I enjoy blogs that:Give you a peek into a person's everyday life, and not just the big events but all the little details that fill our days.Focus on variety rather than limited content or a single theme.Have less than 100 followers.  There are exceptions, of course, but I like the \"getting to know you\" feel of the smaller blogs.  I feel lost and disinclined to comment when the followers number in the 100s.Have pictures.I have learned a few things too:Don't fall behind in your blog post reading.  Holy Cow, those back log of postings build up fast. Don't try to follow more than 50 blogs.  I am over that number now.  It is difficult to keep up if I am over 50.Carry your camera EVERYWHERE (of course mine is now broken - but it off being fixed so in 3 weeks or so, I will carry it everywhere).As ideas occur for future postings, create draft posting holders with those ideas.  I am telling you, once the idea drifts out of my focus, it is gone forever! *sigh*Write about EVERYTHING.  I have done a few off the wall things: Vacuums, hair cuts, my new purse, the weather ... do it all!  And my very favorite thing I have learned in this last year is this:We are all more alike than different.  Maybe there would be more peace in the world if everyone blogged and we all discovered this simple fact.Of course this blog was built on the premise of \"the next 20 years\".  Yikes!  Time flies.  Now I only have 19 years left!!! I have goals to achieve. I think I will check back in a week or so and see just how far along I am with them.  If I have 20 years to achieve them - and if only 5% of that time has passed ... guess I don't have to feel too bad when I find I have fallen short! Or maybe ... ( !! boing !! - a great idea was just born) ... maybe I should make one of my goals be: Don't be too worried about achieving your goals!Yes!!!!Totally genius!:-)Oh, well.  Happy Anniversary to me!"},

Apparently the retractable lens that doesn't retract is a common problem with these smaller cameras.  And, as luck would have it, we HAD purchased additional repair coverage back in December!!  We didn't remember and we didn't have any paperwork, but Best Buys had it in their system.  Yeah for Best Buys!!So the camera is on its way to the camera-hospital to get fixed!!!  Downside: It should take 3 weeks before it comes back.I sure do miss it.I guess I should have posted these pictures first because they pre-date my birth. I just found them in a stack and they are favorites of mine. The one above is my mom with her sister during the 1930s.  Mom on the right is probably about 12 years of age.  Her sister was about 5 years old.  They were very close growing up and they continued to be so even to this day.  And mom's sister is my favorite Aunt.  Mom remembers being thrilled when her sister was born.  She spent alot of time caring for her baby sister.  Once mom described her sister's birth as something of a gift for her - someone born just for her.  It sounds like a thought a 7 year old would have - but I understand the sentiment behind it.  I used to think that their close relationship wasn't such a big deal.  But life sometimes teaches you differently - it really is a big deal - a remarkable gift, actually.Below is a favorite picture of my dad at age 29 in 1946.  Some people are blessed with a young look all their lives.  Dad was one of those people.  This picture was taken the same year my parents wed.  From other pictures and from the rare movie footage we have, Dad was a handsome young man. His dark hair, charming looks and demeanor were passed down to my sister and her 2 girls.  The one regret I have for my dad is that he didn't live long enough to meet any of his grandchildren.  The choices he made in his life sadly shortened his life.  He missed so much."},
{"title": "It started with ...", "date": "Monday, July 18, 2011", "text": "(June 1947)... a first grandchild.  That was me.  A first grandchild on both sides of the family. So it was a big deal - as it is with every first grandchild.  The picture shows 4 generations of my mom's family.  Me on my mom's lap,  her father on the left and his mother on the right. Mom was a beautiful woman.  Dad always said she was beautiful as a young woman.  In the pictures and movies I have seen of her from that time I think she resembles Ingre Berman.(September 1943)And Dad was a handsome young man.  Dark with a boyish look to him.  I can definitely see his charm and attraction in this picture.  I am sure they made a beautiful couple.   Of course in this picture my mom was 17 1/2 years old and dad was 26.  World War II was still going on.  She looked older than 17.  The age difference seems a bit large from our perspective now - maybe not so much then.  And she appears to have a drink in her hand.  Guess the age restriction for alcohol consumption was started much later.  I know mom graduated from high school at 16 as a result of skipping 2 grade levels and was working in Manhattan when she met my dad.I was born just before their first Anniversary.  I didn't hear much about their first years together.  There aren't that many pictures either.  Mom's marriage to dad was difficult.  Details are not important now, but during that time her choices were limited.  She was married for life, and her family and religion would permit no other choice.Don't get me wrong!  Both my parents were wonderful people in their own ways. They both loved me - the few pictures I have show that clearly.  But dad had problems, and it made living with him harder and harder as the years past.  From the point when my own memories are established, I don't remember them ever \"happy\".  And yet, I know they loved each other ... even when things were very bad.  Before my dad died in 1970, mom was the one holding the family together.  She was the one who was our constant!  And yet, while I sat with her in the funeral home waiting to pick out a casket for my dad, I remember her clearly saying ... \"How will I do without him?  Do you think he knew that I loved him?\"My mom's life was never easy those 24 years she was married, but she made a commitment. Knowing how she lived, struggled and sacrificed, I am not sure I could have made the same choice.  But these pictures show hope and possibilities.  I believe it shows love. It is how most unions begin.It is how my story began."},
{"title": "Looking back", "date": "Sunday, July 17, 2011", "text": "Well, I am photo limited right now.  My camera is broken and I don't think I will be buying another one all that soon.  But I am drowning in pictures.  Literally drowning.  Albums and albums.So why not show a few of those.  I have completely enjoyed the blogs where old photos were spotlighted.  I have thought to do the same on my blog.  I might not be able to publish everyday, as I need to sort through my pictures to find what makes sense to use.  And maybe not every blog entry will be focused on this theme.  But it will be a constant for the next few weeks.So, here we go!Once again, we dodged the \"hospital bullet\" with mom and her frequent Urinary Track Infections.As many of you may already know, UTIs are one of the leading  causes of hospitalizations for the elderly.  Mom has been no different than millions of elderly people.  While a UTI for a normal healthy adult isn't such a big deal (uncomfortable, sure, but treatable quickly), for an elderly person it can be deadly.  The condition can begin a simply as most UTIs do - burning and discomfort with urination.  However, in the elderly, they seldom feel those early signs.  Mom never does.  The infection grows and grows without any indication.  And then, appearing suddenly, fever, weakness, disorientation ... all artfully disguised under the normal signs of aging ... napping more, not so steady, and some increased dementia.  By the time my mom shows these symptoms, she is very sick - and it is only hours before she is septic - a life threatening condition. Then, of course, once at the hospital, you must count in the debilitation that results from the enforced inactivity dictated by the hospital protocols.  Twelve to eighteen hours restricted to bed results in weeks of at home physical therapy to get her strength back.  Yes, a UTI is a formidable opponent for the elderly.This time, however, we had several hard-hitters in our corner.  To begin with I knew what symptoms to look for.  I learned that lesson through many previous hospitalizations for the same condition.  (Some things you just have to learn the hard way!) It took me about 3 hours to catch on, but not 24 hours as in the past. Thankfully, I could act fast.  I had antibiotics in the house.  No waiting for the doctor to call in the prescription, no waiting at the pharmacy for them to fill it, no travel time to and fro.  The moment I put the symptoms together in my head with the probably cause, I had her pop an antibiotic.  The last and most important element of our success is her new at-home doctor.  She returned my call promptly, advised me to double dose her - so a second pill was given right after the first.  And the next day, we double dosed her again. Within 24 hours of the first antibiotic, mom was pretty much back to herself.And for anyone who is keeping count, (I am), since mid May, our at-home doctor has saved us from 3 hospitalizations!  So we are doing well here.  Thank you for all your comments of concern both on the blog and by email. Next time we beat the UTI opponent, I will figure out how to play the \"Rocky\" theme song on my blog!!Anyway, next posting ... a new theme to tide me over until I can get my dern camera fixed."},
{"title": "Gone ...", "date": "Thursday, July 14, 2011", "text": "... but hopefully not forgotten!I guess I hit a blogging slump.  Some days I just write topic after topic, no gaps, no wondering what to write next, no real effort ... and other days (like today), I open my blog and notice - \"Yikes, it has been 5 whole fricken' days since I blogged?  What gives?\"I have been busy.  Blog worthy stuff?  I doubt it. But now that you are 6 or 7 sentences into reading, I am going to tell you what I have been busy doing. Don't leave me now!!My iPad - that darn piece of technology sucks up more of my life minutes than it should.  My current game is The Chronicles of Inotia 2.  I am a level 34 Warrior and a Priest and a Magician hang with me.  Together we fight bad guys and are saving the world - I know you didn't realize I was saving the world, but someday it will be evident!  You can thank me later.I have been on a clean-out rampage - again! Last week, we couldn't find the ladder in one of our downstairs closets.  The ladder!!!   So now we can find the ladder and I can actually step inside the closet. I can now also walk around my computer table.  Big improvement.  Of course, now that the junk is gone I can see the dust and dirt!  *sigh*.  I am better at throwing out than I am at cleaning.I am actually knitting again!  That is a very good thing in several ways: I am slowing getting back to me.  I have not been me for awhile, again something you might not have known since I am a very good actress.  And since I haven't stopped buying yarn, using some yarn up is critical to avoiding an \"obsession intervention\" by those who love me.I am getting yelled at by cops.  No ticket!  Just a swaggering law enforcement officer who decided to scream at me because I wandered into a work zone - by accident - believe me I did not want to be there.  I let him yell, didn't offer an apology (but boy was I sorry!) and just backed out.  And he backed his cruiser right along in front of my slow retreating car.  Menacing.  Was he having a bad day or what.Things break in threes for me.  My camera (my new camera - several hundred dollars) is malfunctioning so no pictures.  Just annoyance.  Maybe I can get it fixed. My new air mattress which is my weekend bed with my grand-dogs (less than 2 weeks old - $200) has a leak!  I am really fried about that.  Think I will buy a futon.  My old Maxima (116,000 miles) needed struts!  Do you have any idea how much struts cost on a Maxima?  $2,000. For that kind of money, those struts should be external on the car so everyone can see and admire them!Walking?  No so much.  Curves?  Even less.  I am trying, really, but my life has been busy.For example, mom is running a fever tonight, probably a UTI - which is very common in the elderly.  We started antibiotics this evening, but if we didn't catch this infection in time she will wind up in the hospital tonight with a blood infection!  Just like 2 other times in the last 7 months.  She can get very sick, very fast! Oh well - my bag is packed for the trip should it occur. I can ride over to the hospital behind the ambulance on my new struts. So there it is.  My life for the last week.  What have you guys been up to?  Hope it cost less.See ya!"},
{"title": "Humor - a serious reflection", "date": "Friday, July 8, 2011", "text": "Yesterday I was gifted an award: The Humorous Blogger Award from The Feathered Nest. I accepted this award in my usual fashion.  I recognized that I was accepting something that I asked for ... and I looked for the humor in the fact that I asked, begged, pleaded, and the blogger graciously consented to give me the award.  (I think I will try playing the lottery and see if I can get them to pick my number ... because I ask them to do so!)  :-)  As part of my acceptance, I am asked to talk about how humor has impacted my life.  For me that is a serious topic.  Humor totally changed the path of my life.The roots of my respect for humor begins with meeting the man who became my husband.  I met this man in 1967. I was a college student and he was an employee of the university I attended.  We were married in 1969.Prior to meeting him, my life was problematic.  My family life was dysfunctional.  Somehow I developed a positive outlook on life ... maybe an opposite reaction to the negatives, I cannot begin to guess.  But humor and laughter were not a part of my life experience to that point.And when you are a young female, if you are asked what you look for in a \"boyfriend\" ... it typically is one or more of the following: handsome, popular, successful, understanding ... and so on.  Humorous was not on my list.  As an adult, I now know that humor should be somewhere near the top of the list ... but back then, I didn't realize the value of it. It is hard to value something you haven't experienced.And then this introverted, shy man walked into my life.  He saw life as a negative experience and his outlook was pessimistic, but he had a finely developed sense of humor.  He could make me laugh.  I was drawn to a person who was able to see the world through the lens of amusement.  We were an odd combination.  But we filled in each other missing pieces. We have been together for 44 years ... married for 42 years.  Over that time I learned to see things differently, to see the humor in situations, to deliver a funny line with the right timing (funny is really about timing), and to temper my optimism with a bit of his realism. And he has learned from me as well.  We are still basically the same people we were when we met, but only better - more complete.  We joke about the fact that he keeps me from floating off the face of the earth with my Pollyanna ways, and I keep him from killing someone (not literally, but you know what I am getting at).  Yes, humor impacted my life.  It changed the course of my life.The second requirement of my acceptance was to pass the award onto another blogger.I pass the award onto Chatty Crone.  Now I know that some bloggers may not participate in these award activities.  I respect that.  But since I get to pick, I pick Chatty Crone.  She makes me laugh and smile and see life though a \"fun\" lens.  Yep!  Chatty Crone it is."},
{"title": "Mega Discovery!! And a great award!", "date": "Thursday, July 7, 2011", "text": "I have discovered a technique for getting cool stuff - just ask!  Well, maybe not ask!  More like beg!  More like jump up and down, wave arms in the air, say please, please, please, please, (in a whiny voice), and finally just be so obviously needy for approval, that they take pity on you and do what you ask.No matter!  The technique works and I am gloriously happy!See, one of my blog friends at The Feathered Nest gives out an award called \"The Cat's A**\"(and yes, that is a cat's rear end). Isn't that just the greatest title!?!?  She was giving this award out to some of her blog friends. I saw it.  Immediately I knew this was something I coveted! (I think coveting is a no-no in the Ten Commandments - need to look it up - later.)Anyway, after I totally prostrated myself, (it looked alittle like this) she gave me the award!!!Really, folks. This technique works!Anyway, there are two requirements: I have to blog on how humor has impacted my life. Pass the award onto another deserving blogger.I most certainly will do that in a separate post.  My heart-felt thanks to The Feathered Nest for this award!(Really, folks.  Do not underestimate the power of begging.):-)The hair cut! Notice how artfully I placed the camera in the shot right where my double chins are!Am I good or what! It was amazing to turn around in the salon chair and find about 3 inches of hair on the floor.  I wore my hair in exactly this style - maybe a smidge longer - for probably 20 years.  And then I got this \"great\" idea that longer would be better.  But longer was more work, always in my face, showed my gray hairs more (they were longer, as well), and made me hot, hot, hot! (And not in a good way, either.) When I was overheated (like from vacuuming), it clung wetly to my face and neck and kept me warm and wet.  Next time I think longer is better, I will write down my reasons so I can check back when I am using hair pins and head bands to keep the darn stuff out of my way.I thought this last shot was interesting.  I have a point and shoot camera.  It automatically decides when I need the flash and when I don't.  I like it that way.  But for some of the pictures it flashed creating this interesting picture ... sort of like me shooting a ball of light at the viewer. Actually, upon really looking at this picture, it muted out the wrinkles too.  Maybe the camera does know what it is doing. :-)Anyway, I wonder how much weight I left behind at the salon.  What else I can cut off before I stand on the Weight Watcher's scale on Saturday morning.  :-)Just kidding.(Maybe I will trim my nails and pluck some eyebrow hairs.)"},
{"title": "Restless", "date": "Wednesday, July 6, 2011", "text": "Today I went to my hair dresser and said \"cut it off\", and she did!I have been wearing my air longish (long enough to tuck behind my ears) for a few years. But it was driving me nuts!!  Too hot!!  So back to the style I wore about 5 years ago. Very short, very cool, very easy. Mom loves it. She said she didn't recognize me when I came up the side walk.  And I felt 10 pounds lighter.Saw the doctor today for my GI reflux.  Nice man.  A friend.  He said I could take Omeprazole for reflux continuously if it helps.  It did work while I was using it, so I will.  He went down the list of causes and things to avoid.  When he hit coffee, I told him to stop!  Coffee stays! Then he mentioned stress!  Another bump in the road.  Sorry, but no way to avoid stress right now.  So I am hoping the pills do the trick!  He was happy my weight was down 5 pounds since my last visit.  Me too.I also just had to steam clean my rugs on the first floor of my town house this evening.  Yes, I started at 8:30 pm and finished at 10:00 pm.  Then I was so pumped  up I vacuumed the upstairs - bedroom level.  Mom was in bed, but she had her hear hearing aids out for the night so it didn't disturb her, and my husband was totally oblivious. He just kept working on his cross word puzzle while laying on the bed in his underwear!  I was a vacuuming fool. He knew better than to question me. :-)Now I am writing my blog entry, just because I need to ... Restless, that is all I can say."},
{"title": "My other caregiver role", "date": "Tuesday, July 5, 2011", "text": "(Meathead in 2004 - his more \"buff\" days)This morning at 5:00 am, I awoke to the sounds of heavy breathing and restlessness ... only to discover that one of my granddog's, Meathead, was having a Grand Mal seizure.As some of you may remember from a previous post, Meathead has canine epilepsy!  His seizures have been part of our lives since he was 3 years old.  And over the last 5 years medicine management to control them has been an ever increasing and challenging responsibility. For those who have not experienced seizures, it can be a frightening situation to view.  For Meathead, he falls to his side, legs are extended in a rigid position, there is strong jerking movements, sometimes his head is arched back, he drools extensively, heavy labored breathing, and sometimes he loses stool and urine control.  He has no awareness of his surroundings. For Meathead, that state can last about 60 seconds - which feels like a long 60 minutes when it is happening to a loved one.  Post seizure disorientation can be almost as unsettling.  He seems to come awake, but doesn't know his surroundings and cannot focus on any one thing.  He paces quickly around in circles and pants greatly like he is overheated.  Stairways need to be blocked because he can not safely manage to descend them during this period.  Eventually he pulls out of this disorientation, able to focus on you when you say his name.  The panting slowly subsides and usually he falls asleep. This period can last from 15 minutes to 2 hours.How do we manage this condition? Meathead is on 2 seizure drugs given twice a day.  Since the age of 3 he has been on an ever increasing dose of potassium bromide.  When that medication alone couldn't prevent seizures (as frequent as twice a month), he was started on phenobarbital.  That combination of meds reduced his seizure activity to occasional strange behavior and extended his grand mal seizures episodes to about 6 months apart.  A big improvement.  But epilepsy is never cured, just controlled.  There are breakthrough seizures, like we had this morning - always heartbreaking to watch.Managing the actual seizure has become almost second nature for me.  I try to remain calm (although my brain and heart are in overdrive),  I administer 1 cc of Valium rectally to ward off any repeat seizures (cluster seizures are also a part of his history), stairways are blocked, noise and lights are reduced in the area, and an ice pack is placed on his lower back.  Otherwise, we are just calmly present for him waiting for the episode to pass. It always does.So here I sit, now 6:40 am in the morning, wide awake with a morning coffee, trying to work off the Adrenalin that shot into my system at 5:00 am.   Meathead is peacefully asleep on the couch trying to catch up on the rest he missed for the last 90 minutes. In moments of reflection I often wonder how is it that some people get a life time of care giving for others, while some folks never have to care for anyone other than themselves.  Is it because I can, that I was born with a predisposition to help and assist others?  If my nature was less wired in this fashion, would my caregiver load be less?  Or is it something that is common to all humans? Is it an element of our natures that is developed and refined by practice?  I don't know the answer, but I know I have had my fair share of experience in this role. I held the traditional role of caregiver to our children.  Mom is my third elderly relative to require extended assistance. My cat has degenerative kidney disease and needs subcutaneous fluids every other day to live. My husband's eyes are failing (my next care giving assignment, I am sure). My son's dog has epilepsy. I have had a lot of practice in this role.So now it is 7:30 am, the coffee isn't keeping me alert.  I would really love to just take a morning nap.  But in an hour, mom will be up ... Better get a second cup of coffee."},

No one else was cheery!We had our deck stained ... yeah!  The tarp the painters threw over our air conditioner (to protect it), overheated it, causing it to shut off.  I just love having conversations with contractors where I need to tell them that I am withholding full payment until I am sure my air conditioner is alright!  They are such sunny, bright, and friendly conversations ... NOT!My GI reflux is giving me fits!  My doctor's appointment is Wednesday.  A discussion of my eating habits, weight loss, or the stress in my life will be off limits.  I want drugs!!  I won't give up my daily glass of red wine, I am in Weight Watchers, and I can't give up my mom.  Thank God I know this doctor very well, and we are long time friends.  He will understand when I hand him his prescription pad and say \"write\".I said I wouldn't blog about this ... but I lost 1.8 pounds last week.  Good, but what about the 10 pounds I had hoped for in the first week of this program!?!? *sigh* (No, I won't give up my daily glass of red wine.  Yes, they are empty calories.  I have given up potato chips, french fries, cake with lardy icing, snickers, moon pies ... the red wine stays!)There ... I feel much better."},
{"title": "The Hair Cut", "date": "Thursday, June 30, 2011", "text": "Yesterday my mother took her first voluntary, self propelled trip out of the house and back .,. the first trip since mid-April.  The time in between has not been boring.  Three hospitalizations, many ambulance transports, and ongoing home care visits!  But the final result was ... ta-da ... a trip to get her hair cut!!The trip itself was a bit of an adventure - not a nail biter - but a sincere effort for us both.I determined that the temperature, air quality and general weather conditions were good enough.  Her oxygen ran low earlier in the week with walking so I wanted near perfect external conditions for this trip.  We had it. Check!! Getting that darn wheel chair up from the basement, and then down my outside steps and then shoved into my trunk made me break out in a sweat. But I did it. Check.She descended the 20 outside steps to the car with only one rest period.  Oxygen was pretty good.  Check.She took the 5 minute car ride to my shopping center. Check.She sat in the wheel chair from the car to the salon and surviving my wheel chair driving. Her blood pressure probably went up when  I almost dumped her on the floor of the salon. The wheel chair wouldn't roll over the salon door sill - but she arrived safely, mostly, so I count it is a Check!! :-)She got her hair cut.  The salon chair had a foot rest that proved to be an obstacle but with the help of 3 people she surmounted it. Check.I thought she looked tired so we sat outside and enjoyed a Rita's icy treat - the temperature was perfect and we were sitting in the shade.  A social moment. Check.The 5 minute ride home was uneventful! Check.The trip up the stairs to the house was a bit more than she could do without several rest periods, but she did it. Check. We arrived home and she was exhausted!  Me Too. It took 3 hours to do that round trip.  But she looks better. Check, check, and check."},

Check out the right side of my blog and you will see a button that says \"My Next 20\" with red flowers.  That's my button and I want you all to take my button and put it on your blog.  Yes, it is shameless self-promotion, but isn't it cute?  Don't you want my button? Of course you do!  :-) Once the button is installed on your blog - it looks pretty there too.  And then if someone clicks it, they are directed by to my blog ('cause its all about me, you know - LOL).Anyway, back to the journey ... so I asked Chatty Crone, a blog friend ... how do you get one of those button thingys?  If you haven't seen Chatty Crone's blog, you should.  She most generously shared the name of a fellow blogger who might be able to help.  That blogger is Diane at The Blue Ridge Gal Blog (who, by the way, has a wonderful deer and fawn video you must see.)

It is an example of how friendly and generous the blogging community is.And the rest is history!  It started with a button and it resulted in a new face to my blog ... and a button!!And I am thrilled with it.  This new face is cleaner and not so busy.  And it is more personal.Thank you Diane.

{"title": "The Miracle of Cousins", "date": "Tuesday, June 28, 2011", "text": "(My cousin Linda, probably 3,  on the right, and me on the left, probably 5)Family histories can be pretty spotty.  Mine certainly is, especially on my father's side.  There were few pictures and few memories, because contact with my paternal extended family was limited to years very early on. By my teen years, I don't remember any contacts.Memories fade some over long periods of time, but the knowledge that my paternal cousins existed always floated in the back of my brain.  The image of my cousin Linda's face in this picture below is one of the many memories I have of her from childhood. In fact, this is exactly how I remember her ... sort of serious and focused, but just below the surface there is the hint of a smile.  I totally love this picture of us in the center holding hands.  We were family and friends back then ... but as our families drifted apart we were left with just our childhood memories.(From left to right: Linda's cousin, Susan, me, Linda and my cousin Ray, Linda's brother.)Fast forward to the present.  We are grown ... seniors actually.  And most of our lives have been lived apart.  So much time had passed.  One day my sister got restless at work and Googled our maiden name.  Our name was unusual.  And at the top of the list popped Linda's name.  She was married now but had kept her maiden name (Thank God!).After much excitement and tons of emails and pictures back and forth, we decided to get together ... after 40 years of absence!  The year I believe is 2004.(from left to right: Aunt Phebe, my mom, my sister, my cousin Leslie, me and my cousin Linda)This joy filled picture is the result of the 40 year absence.  Linda and I (far right) are together again (I bet we are holding hands behind us.)  And my sister and Leslie are an addition to the family: neither had been born at the time of the first 2 pictures. Since that 2004 picture was taken, we have remained close seeing each other several times a year, sharing lives and hobbies and love.  It is one of the most wonderful experiences of my whole life.My childhood memories of my dear Aunt Phebe are clear: she was a loving, affectionate person with a ready smile.  I miss her now as she died several years ago, but we had our moment before life took us in different directions again.  She is now at peace, and I still have the wonderful relationships of my cousins.One last picture I must share.  (Here are my Aunt Phebe and Mom walking the beach together ... holding hands.)  This picture makes me happy and sad at the same time.  It makes me happy to see them together happy after such a long absence, just like me and Linda.  My mom remembers Phebe as her friend, married to brothers, and young and happy at that time.  But I am sad my Aunt Phebe has passed on and my mom has lost her ability to walk unaided as she does in the picture.  Her health is fragile and her memories are fading.Time just marches on.  So I am forever grateful for the miracle of my cousins!"},
{"title": "Blog change is good", "date": "Monday, June 27, 2011", "text": "Summer is now officially here and I thought it was time to change to look of my blog.  I struggle a bit with the tools Blogger provides.   Eventually I get something that is pleasing to my eye.  My eye loves \"green\".  Picking from the pre-designed templates is sometimes difficult.  I don't know how others feel about them, but to my \"eye\", (it is all about me, you know), some of those templates are just too busy.  Beautiful but busy.  Once applied to the blog it looks terrible. And then the design template sometimes uses text colors that just fade out making it hard to read.  I don't understand why those text colors where selected for the design.  So I spend considerable time making adjustments to the pre-selected colors to make it easy to read.And this time I wanted to add one of my own pictures to my header.  I tried several times, but I kept getting the message that my file was too big.  And I had no idea how to shrink it.  Oh well, I am pleased with this design and color mix ... at least until fall.  This design feels very much like summer to me. And I hope that come fall they will have some new designs to choose from on Blogger!How often do you change your blog design?  How do you feel about the blogger design choices?  How much effort do you put into adjusting the text colors? Have you used any of the blog design sites that allow you to select one of their templates to apply to your blog?  How well does that work? Or is it just me?  Am I blog-disabled?   :-)"},
{"title": "My Sunday Walk", "date": "Sunday, June 26, 2011", "text": "A Normal Day!Yes, they do occasionally happen to me. So that means nothing special happened to write about.It seemed like a good day to spot lighted my walk and the beautiful community I live in.Having lived here for 25 years, I sometimes forget just how lucky I am to have such wonderful and safe places to walk.  Looking at the pictures I took today reminds me to be grateful.Much of my walk looks a lot like this.  Neighborhood streets that are devoid of cars and people.  I don't mind because the neighborhood is well maintained and safe. But if I was walking around one of the local lakes, I would see a lot of peopleAnd I get a kick out of seeing some of the houses.  This flag hangs outside a pretty traditional house.  House flags seem to be common in my area but this one was very different.Most houses go more traditional when the choose to decorate, such as this house.  Looks like they are planning for the upcoming 4th of July.Today, once again, I chose to step out of the neighborhoods and take some of the back paths.  All are beautiful.  I don't do this often because some are very remote.  But they are also very worth the trip.This time the paths I chose ran very close to the backyards of homes.  I felt very comfortable.  My walk ended back at my townhouse.  This is the view of the terraced front area.  As you can see, the townhouses in this group are up on a hill away from the parking areas.  It is the main reason we chose this location.  In our previous community, the headlights of the parking cars would shine in our windows.  I loved the idea that we were away from the street.  The downside is that you have to climb those steps when you are moving all your worldly possessions in, climb the steps when you have a car full of groceries, climb the steps when you are 85 years old and your daughter thought it would be a good idea for you to move in with her.  :-)  You get the idea.Our townhouse is on this little hill.  Not so high up, but still high enough to be a barrier for my mom.  Those darn steps have kept our legs strong over the last 25 years - so there are positives.This last picture shows the back of a group of town houses.  Townhouse living has it pluses and minuses.  The minuses are that you are very close to your neighbors.  So if someone isn't so keen on keeping up their property, you have to live with that problem close up and personal. Thankfully, our community has managed to maintain the exteriors ... if the back sides of the town homes look good, you know the community cares about their neighborhood and property values.Yes, I am very lucky!  A nice community even after 25 years!"},
{"title": "Weight Watchers", "date": "Saturday, June 25, 2011", "text": "Today was Weight Watchers Day for my daughter and I.  We are both looking to improve our health and ... oh forget that!  You don't believe that!!  We want to drop some pounds so we look fabulous for the May wedding.  And I know that I ranted about our culture's focus on being thin.  I still detest that. I am not into \"thin\" or \"skinny clothes\" or discussing my weight loss efforts adnausium with anyone who will stand still long enough (another thing I hate).  I just know I need structure to drop some weight ... more than just eating in moderation. But I am happy to share my findings about the current Weight Watcher program.  My history with Weight Watchers goes way back.  In using the program, I became a Life Time Member.  Without getting into the fine details, a person becomes a life time member once they have reached their goal weight and held that weight for a fixed period of time.  The program has always appealed to me:  it uses real everyday food, you don't need to buy your food only from them, it promotes healthy eating as a life style change, there are no forbidden foods, and it provides multifaceted support: group meetings,  the Weight Watcher brand of food easily available at grocery stores, and online support.  But nothing is perfect and there is a downside for me personally. I know this will sound odd but I dislike the focus on food ... meaning, I just hate spending so much time deciding what to eat, examining food labels, measuring, tracking, monitoring ... I hate that part.  But for me to be successful, I need to do that part.  Otherwise I can easily eat more than I intend.The program is based on a points system and you are allowed to eat a fixed number of points each day.  The current hybrid of this program is called Points Plus.  In the past, points were assigned to foods based on calorie counts, the fiber and fat content.  Points Plus assigns points based on carb and protein counts as well as the fiber and fat content.  The shift in focus brings this diet more in line with the  diabetes diet which is a very healthy way of eating.And I am such  sucker for \"tools\".  Since the program is new, they have all new tools (some are pictured above.)  I bought this kit and it included a bunch of very useful stuff to help you understand and implement the program. Yes, I am happy to start this program again.Final Note: So you won't hear me blogging about this again.  Come May 2012, when I post some pictures of the wedding, what I hope you will say is - wow, you look great!  That will be good enough for me."},

I have 2 full flights of stairs that connect the 3 townhouse levels, and 4 steps from the front door to the first floor.

I have the leg muscles to prove it.But steps are not the topic of this post.I am the proud owner of an upstairs vacuum cleaner and a downstairs vacuum cleaner.  And not just any vacuums ... two Dyson vacuums!! (Now you know why I called this post the Upstairs and Downstairs help.  Who would open a posting that said Vacuums!)Disclaimer: This is not an ad for Dyson products. I am not being compensated for saying these things. But I am thrilled with the product line and now that I have a new second one, I am enthused all over again. So just humor me!My first Dyson (we will call her Bertha) is a DC17 Absolute Animal - yep, that is the actual name. She's a big lady.  And she has cleaned faithfully with no upkeep for 5 years. I only recently washed the filter that they said should be washed yearly. Bertha is a workhorse machine for all 3 levels of this townhouse.  With 2 cats and 3 dogs now - Absolute Animal Bertha has been one terrific machine.Look at those muscles!!But now that my mom lives here, we put in a stair glide from the first to the second floor.     Bertha and me ... we have made many perilous trips together up and down this narrowed flight of steps, and each time I thought ... there isn't enough room for Bertha and Harold (the Acorn stair glide) and me on this set of stairs.  This is an accident just waiting to happen, and I knew Harold would feel badly if it did!!So last week I went out to purchase another vacuum, and, of course, is was a Dyson.  This time I got a smaller more lightweight model called DC25 Animal (lets call him Oscar). Oscar has the new Ball technology for easy steering.  He is a gem of a machine. Oscar is the upstairs help and Bertha is the downstairs help.  We are all happy!Thank you for reading.Sincerely,Elaine (retired knitter), Bertha, Harold and OscarPS - Someday I hope to add to the help by finding someone else to push Bertha and Oscar around."},
{"title": "Happy Birthday Dearest Daughter", "date": "Thursday, June 23, 2011", "text": "How do you describe a daughter who is the best daughter in the whole world? No sense challenging that statement.  I have done a look-around, and I know alot of daughters and my opinion is indisputable!Today is her birthday.  I won't announce her actual age, females usually hate that.  She is a daughter, a friend, a confidant, a joy, a beautiful and caring person, a Frenchie Mom, and so much more.  In fact this year, a most terrible year for me, this year she was also my crutch. Children shouldn't have to take that role in your life (at least no so early in life), but she did for me.  She's been here most weekends helping me cope with the life I now lead.  I look forward to her smiling face, our late night talks, her hugs, her grandma sitting, her advice ... without her, this year would have been unbearable.  How do you adequately thank your daughter for that kind of support?Remembering her birth years ago ... it was an easy event.  Second c-sections usually are.  She was a happy child and easy to raise.  The biggest problem of her childhood was that she didn't sleep through the night until well past a year.  I remember waking every night between 2 and 3 in the morning, dog tired, and she would greet me with a great big smile on her face, standing in her crib with her little arm hanging over the side, swinging her baby bottle around by the nipple like it was a toy - just as happy as she could be to see me.  She had a Gerber baby face and an easy personality. And she was a cuddler!  From the moment she was placed in my arms, she snuggled close.  And she was always close to me growing up.  Despite having experienced many bumps in the road of her life, she still has an affectionate and giving nature.When I recognized  my son's birthday last September, I made many observations of what parenthood is like and how I would do it all again.   The only idea that captures the scope of what it is like to have such wonderful children in your life is ... \"Completely and Forever.\"  Your children completely steal your heart ... forever! Nothing ever changes that.Nothing.Happy Birthday my dearest daughter!  If I had a 100 daughters, I would still love you best!! Completely and Forever!!Love, momxxoo"},
{"title": "Curves - mine!", "date": "Wednesday, June 22, 2011", "text": "Now that I have captured your attention ....This post is not about my curves ... really, they aren't that interesting. And pictures of them would be most disappointing.I returned to Curves after an absence of 2 months.  Technically I visited twice in May, but we were not out of the woods with mom's medical stuff then.  So May visits don't count.I typically go in the afternoon - between 2 and 4.  The area is pretty deserted at that time just like today, and it is how I like it.  You have the freedom to start anywhere in circuit and stay on individual pieces of equipment as long as you want.I really like Curves.  It provides me the toning and strength that walking doesn't give me.  Walking and Curves are like two sides of the same coin.  I love the look of this wall painting in the studio.  Starting on Saturday, my daughter and I are going to return to Weight Watchers.  We are going to get svelte and be just gorgeous for the wedding in May 2012.This will be me and my daughter in 10 months!!  Woo Hoo!!  I think I will be the female in the purple top.  She looks alittle older than the girl in the pink top (who will be my daughter), don't you think?  Or maybe she has Mumps!  Look at those cheeks.Or maybe I am just delirious with the rush of circulating blood surging through my veins!  Here is a poster that hangs in the studio.  I find the message oddly relevant for me as I love French Fries ... except that I prefer my French Fries straight ... straight from MacDonald's.They have the best fries and I always ask for extra salt!Ahh, ... simple pleasures.But this poster is a reminder that as the future \"mother of the groom\", I will need to give those little gems up in favor of carrot sticks or something.*sigh*So here I am at the end of my work-out!  Those are my feet!  And those are my Curves shoes.  Yes, I have Curves shoes.  The studio wants you to use clean shoes on their equipment.I managed to capture this picture of my feet, when no one was looking.  You can imagine just how odd it would seem with me working out on the equipment, holding a camera pointed at my feet and snapping a picture. How would I explain that??  \"I take pictures of all my shoes.\" or \"I love my feet. They are my best feature.\" or  \"Wow, look at those leg muscles.  Must take pictures.\"  :-)No, better to just sneak a picture with no comment."},

My best friend is a Pug named Grimace Roberto Geronimo Shanks.  He also happens to be one of my grand-dogs.(Here he is in his \"Hawaiian Guy\" costume.)Grimace came to our family at the age of 3, being adopted from a Pug rescue group. He came with the name of \"Bud\", but who wouldn't change that to a more substantial name like Grimace Robert Geronimo Shanks.We know very little of his history before lucking out by going to our family. But an individual that could give up that face, didn't deserve to own it in the first place.  And now he has a papa, a mama-to-be, a grandma and an aunt as well as a very grand name.And that is just part of his extended family.How do I know that he is my best friend?That is easy.  Of my 3 grand dogs, Meathead loves me dearly, but he would choose his papa over me.  Milo loves me dearly, but he would choose his mama over me.  Grimace ... hands down!  He would choose me over anyone else in the whole world.(Here I am sharing a very interesting and engrossing topic. Here he is waiting for me to say words  like \"dinner\", \"walk\", or \"cookie\".) :-)Grandmas should love all their grand-dogs equally.I do.But sometimes one raises to the level of a Best Friend Forever!Grimace and I are clearly BFFs!!!"},
{"title": "Day 2 - Grave Yard View", "date": "Monday, June 20, 2011", "text": "Today's walk was overcast and looked like rain.  I did the walk, but I decided to include pictures from another walk taken in May - that took me past this house in my neighborhood ... a house that has been here long before the neighborhood or the city.The city I live in has house tours.  The tour cost $20 and you can walk through 4 preselected houses.  The range of selected houses span the scope of our city's history. We are young.  This planned city of Columbia is 44 years old this year. But the span of house history in our county is pretty old.The house pictured above was build around 1750 - yes, before we declared our independence from England as a nation.  It is about a 5 minute walk from my house.  I wasn't on the tour, so I couldn't walk through the house ... darn!  But its most interesting feature isn't inside.What makes this house special for me (besides being old and existing in the middle of a 20th century neighborhood) is the old family grave site attached to the property.The graves date from the mid-1800s.  The family name on most tombstones is Worthington.What I like most about this grave yard ... besides its age and location, is the fact it is maintained enough to not to appear abandoned, but not overly maintained as to make it be in congruent with the age of the tombstones.I also love that the house has been occupied since being built.  Imagine the stories the walls and the graveyard could tell."},

It is on my calendar and it must happen.The flower picture is just to put a cheery face on my sad state of affairs! But it is a pretty good picture, don't you think?Fitting my stuff into mom's home care visitor schedule, her morning tasks, our scheduled other commitments, regular to-dos ... finding time for me has proved to be hard.  I am totally de-conditioned.  Again.And this time I am the mother of the groom, so I must get back in shape.So I am following \"Happy One's\" lead (again) and blogging about my walk once in awhile and documenting it in pictures.  If you haven't had a chance to visit her blog, Life is Good, you are missing out.  She shares her daily walks and bits and pieces of her life - alot like other blogs do but her focus is consistently - as her title suggests - Life is Good.  We don't hear enough of that now adays.Again I am taking my normal walking route around the neighborhood and again I am seeking out visually appealing snapshots to share ... and there is always something that catches the eye. And again, I am appalled after walking only 15 minutes how much stamina I have lost.  But I push on anyway. Again.Here is the view from this day's walk.I usually try to avoid these beautiful walking trails in our city.  They are beautiful, serene, and a treasure for those who live nearby, like me, but they are somewhat remote.  I guess I watch too much TV, but taking these trails is rare for me because they are outside my comfort level ... except today!The trails are sprinkled with well maintained playgrounds. I seldom see anyone using them.  Guess they are too remote for most people.The trails frequently spill out into familiar neighborhoods just like this path did this afternoon. It wasn't the longest walk I have ever done (29 minutes) or the most steps (3556), but I did get out the door on a day when I was feeling pretty down, and I returned feeling more reasonable.  Day 1 completed (again)."},

I have absolutely no idea what is expected.   I was a bride once, and my mom helped me, so I have some idea what the mother of the bride does.  Of course, that was 42 years ago.  And my husband and I were very young. Weddings then were primarily managed by the bride's family - especially if the parents were paying.  I would assume that young couples today may still share the controls with their parents if they are young ... but more mature couples ... I am guessing that the whole process in very very different from my personal experience.What to do! To start with I have offered my help!  I am good at taking direction.  There is always tons of stuff that needs to be done. (I am not sure what that will be ... I am such a novice.)And then what!!Buy a book!!  Of course. That is always the answer for me.  And I love Amazon.com.  They have absolutely everything.  I typed in \"Mother of the Groom\" and up popped a list of books on this very topic (who knew).  I guess I am not the first one to ask this question.   This book was at the top of the Amazon list!!!Mother of the Groom by Sharon NaylorOne Click Purchase - and it is mine.

I must get a dress, I must have fancy shoes, I guess I will need to get my hair done.  My nails are a mess.  Maybe I need to get my teeth whitened.  Eyebrows plucked.  OMG!! ... I will have to wear makeup and panty hose.  No!! I haven't done any of that for a long time!  Eleven months can pass in a blink of an eye!!! Panic!!

{"title": "No Impact Man - A book review", "date": "Friday, June 17, 2011", "text": "No Impact ManThe adventures of a guilty liberal who attempts to save the planet and the discoveries he makes about himself and our way of life in the processby Colin Beavan, published 2009.Ironically, that book title must be the longest title in the world about the topic of minimalism!  But don't be put off by the title.  It is a great read.The summary offered on the back of the book reads as follows:What does it really take to live eco-effectively?  For one year, Colin Beavan swore off plastic and toxins, turned off his electricity, went organic, became a bicycle nut, and tried to save the plant from environmental catastrophe while dragging his young daughter and his Prada-wearing wife along for the ride.  Together they attempted to make zero impact on the environment while living right in the heart of Manhattan, and this is the sensational, funny and consciousness-raising story of how they did it.  With No Impact Man, Beavan found that no-impact living is worthwhile--and richer, fuller, and more satisfying in the bargain.I will admit, I am a sucker for stories about people who attempt unusual things.  Added to that fact, as I get older the statement \"More is Less\", rings true to me.  I am still working on decluttering my life.  I am interested in making my life simpler.  Just the act of having less in my space, reduces my stress.  But I struggle with that concept as well.  The \"I want\" bug still runs rampant in my hobby life.  This chronical is filled with the details of a life style that I would never consider attempting.  For example, I like to be comfortably cool in the summer.  Turning off the electric power and my air conditioning just doesn't appeal to me.  While I could give up my car and use public transportation (especially in a city environment), I wouldn't care to limit myself to just walking or bicycling to get places.  I could give up cable TV but I still want to keep my TV to see rented movies.  And I am hooked on the Internet.  I am more of a middle-of-the-road \"more is less\" individual. It is fascinating, however, to follow the author's efforts to have no impact on the environment.  He tackles each change and challenge with humor and research. And he doesn't propose that this extreme way of life should be permanent. He committed himself and his family for only one year.  But the journal of his efforts does raise awareness of the wasteful impact our culture has on our earth.  I suspect that if there were more middle-of-the-road individuals on this planet, we could seriously retard the world's general ecological decline.I strongly recommend this book - not just to increase ecological awareness, but to see what it is like to step outside the box and live differently for a year.  I am sure it will have you looking at your world differently."},
{"title": "Tired", "date": "Thursday, June 16, 2011", "text": "Tired!  Seems to be what I am most of the time.There is no doubt that mom's hospital stays put me in a sleep deficit.  The hospital provides everything you need to get well ... except rest!  When you think on it, it is amazing that anyone gets well there without rest.  Rest is God's way of replenishing  the body.  It seems to be the first thing we humans take away when we go to the hospital.And then there are the nights at home.  I sleep well about every other night.  It has been like that for about a year.  I guess I could ask for a sleeping aid, but I don't think that is the answer. I would be concerned that I wouldn't be alert if mom needed help during the night.  So a sleep aid is out.Exercise is probably part of the answer ... I have slipped off the exercise wagon this spring. I have had many starts, but in keeping it up I fall short. Maybe if we could get out from under the health care visitors we have each week, and I could give up house cleaning, and I could hire a cook, and mom's own exercise needs weren't such a priority for me, and the heat wasn't so oppressive when I do have time, and I wasn't such an excuse maker!  Maybe Exercise would be the answer.  Maybe.Maybe I just need to get more sleep.  Energy for everything else would fall into place.Off to check my to-do list for today.Wonder if I added \"rest\" to that list, could I do it.Tired."},
{"title": "A Thank You Letter", "date": "Sunday, June 12, 2011", "text": "June 12, 2001Dear Howard County General Hospital,My mom and I came home this day.  She is doing much better thanks to you.It is good manners to thank those who were there when you needed them most.  We are not strangers to you, and you have always been there for us when we needed you most.Thank you Emergency Room!I dislike a lot of things about you ... your noise, your bright lights, your uncomfortable beds and chairs, and the hours and hours and hours we spend waiting for test results.  BUT, the care we receive each visit is outstanding. Have you considered piping in some classical music???Thank you Cafeteria. I won't starve when I am there.  I am not gastronomically impressed, but I can keep up my strength, at least.You might consider serving the same items you give your patients.  My mom had the most wonderful meals brought to her room.  I would gladly pay to eat some of those.Thank you Coffee Shop.  Your coffee and lunch salads are excellent.  But on Sunday you were closed!!  What is with that?Sunday is a big visitors day.  Why are you closed?  I had to buy 2 cups of coffee from the cafeteria today.  That would have been two punches on my brand new coffee club card toward a free coffee!!  Oh, well.  I am sure we will meet again.Thank you Gift Shop.  I bought the most beautiful bag there.  It made me feel better when I bought it, because I was a little down about missing my day trip to The Mannings Spin-In Day in PA with my cousin on Saturday.  It was also supposed to be a day out with my husband - just the two of us. We don't get too many of those.I know what I did was shop-therapy, but still.  You were there to give me that little boost!Close up of the stitch work.  Isn't it beautiful?  Everything about the bag is beautiful and well thought out. It is American-made as well.Even the last day nurse we had commented on the bag.  Apparently she saw it in the gift shop as well and thought seriously about getting it.  Then it was gone!!:-)Thank you Reception Desk.  You always greet me with a smile, even though I was the \"crazy lady of December\" fame!  And thank you \"little old lady in the red blazer from December\" for not calling the Behavioral Unit on me - when I probably should have had an intervention!  I am much better now!!Thank you Waiting Area.  This lovely spot is just down the hall from my mother's beautiful room.  I love the water fall down the pane of glass, the beautiful picture on the wall (right), the nice chairs for relaxing and the view of the front entrance of the hospital. It is a nice little respite space.The picture on the right was a favorite of mine.For the record - this beautiful picture in that Waiting Area is bolted to the wall!  Yes, I checked.  I love this picture.  My snap shot does not do it justice.  (Please do not ask why or how I know about the bolt on the wall. I will admit to nothing.)Thank you Human Resources for hiring such wonderful and dedicate staff members.  My experiences with all of them - including the red blazer woman - were exceptional.A special thank you to mom's new Home Health physician, Dr. Kristen Clark.  This wonderful physician has visited mom only 2 times previously.  Her focus is to keep her out of the hospital.  Of course, mom seems to get very sick within hours of our first symptom so it is hard to head off a hospitalization if you wait for the first symptom.  While in the hospital mom was well cared for by a hospitalist, Dr. Mahin Choudhury.  But Dr. Clark took the time to review the hospital records remotely and brain storm ways we can avoid other hospital stays in the future. She called me in the hospital with her ideas.  No other doctor has ever called without me initiating the call.  Dr. Clark - you are what all doctors should be!Finally, let me say thank you to the hospital on behalf of my mom.  She may not be grateful right now.  In fact, as each day passed and she got better, she awakened each morning with a major chip on her shoulder.  She was not grateful for your help, or her improving health, or for the family who has surrounded her every step of the way ... no, she seems to fall back to the \"glass is half empty\" mentality.  I am soooo not that kind of person.  So this morning, I set her straight - no pity, just a recitation of all the wonderful blessings she has and how lucky she is, and if she couldn't change her attitude to recognize all the good stuff, her most ardent supporter (me) would sit in the downstairs lobby rather the hospital room with \"her-most-ungrateful-self\".  My voice was raised and my anger was evident.  I think she heard me.  Once my mom gets home, she may be grateful as well for your excellent care and beautiful surroundings!  She wouldn't be as well today if it wasn't for all of you.  So my mom sends her thanks, too. Trust me on that.With that said, let me say that I share my mom's desire to never return here. Five hospital stays in 6 months is a bit much.But I also recognize that we will be back.  It is comforting to know that when we need you, you are there.Sincerely,A Grateful Resident and Daughter"},
{"title": "Hospital Journey", "date": "Saturday, June 11, 2011", "text": "Saturday night!  I sit in a dark, quiet hospital room typing away on my computer while my mom sleeps nearby.  Thank you all for your notes both on the blog and by email regarding our return trip to the hospital.  Your well wishes and shared experiences really were wonderful.  She is very much improved this evening.  I must admit that 6 months ago if anyone had said that we would have 5 hospitalizations, 2 sub acute rehab experiences and 2 home care experience, AND I would be changing my mom's doctor to a person who makes house calls ... I would never have believed it!  It has been a challenging 6 months, but we are both \"still standing\" and as of today, she looks and sounds great!  We are hoping for a discharge tomorrow.Her health continues to be fragile - many serious conditions to manage, and as with all elder care, the future is unpredictable.  But while I sit here in the dark of this hospital room, I am content.  We have made huge changes to support her many needs and our knowledge base has grown significantly as well.    I have gotten to know this hospital very well.  I'd like to share a bit of it with you. Howard County General Hospital is an excellent facility.  Thirty-five years ago this month my daughter was born here.  It was very much smaller and things were very different.  Today, patients have private rooms (mom's room is in the new wing - very state of the art).  Here is a shot of the one side of the room.  To the left is the patient's bed and to the right is a couch that opens up to a bed for family members.  I don't open it, because I need very little space to sleep.  But it is comfortable. The physician, nursing and support staff are excellent.  The patient's food is great.  In fact, they call it \"room service\" because you order what you want off a menu and all the choices mom's has had were excellent.  I even love the gift shop. I purchased a bag there that is perfect for these hospital jaunts - it holds everything I need including my iPad in an organized way - many interior pockets.  There is a great little coffee stand in the lobby with great salads, sandwiches, and coffee.  The cafeteria for staff and guests is adequate - except when you have 5 hospital episodes in 6 months ... then it looses its charm.  We are lucky to have this facility within 15 minutes of our house.To conclude: I have developed a \"short list\" of things I wish I didn't know about this hospital.  For example:I now know a few of the ER staff.  I would rather meet them for coffee outside of work hours rather than visiting them at their place of work all the time.  :-)I know how to adjust this thing-a-ma-jiggy!  It is part of the fluids and meds administration for mom's IV.  When the alarm goes off (which is does alot), the flow of the IV is automatically stopped, adjustments to the patient's position are made, and a restart button is pushed.  I have even learned to read the screen as it is working.  (You have been somewhere too many times when you can work their professional equipment.)I decided to get a \"frequent flyer\" card for the coffee shop in the lobby.  Ten cups and I get one free!   I have one cup marked off.  I wish I took a card the first time it was offered to me back in December.  I am sure I would have earned quite a few free cups by now. I discovered exactly where the hospital \"behavioral unit\" is located.  No, they didn't need to send psychiatry after me.  I was well behaved this trip.  In December, however, I was close to taking out one little old lady at the main reception desk who was totally absorbed in her name tag duties.  I still remember her eyes shifting from side to side as I leaned over the desk giving her a piece of my mind and waving my ratty name tag in her face.  She was probably all of 90 pounds and very smartly dressed in a little red blazer.  I was very tired, very sick myself and very worried about mom.  I am sure my hair looked stringy and in a disarray.  I know I was rumpled from sleeping in my street clothes.  I was in no mood for her rigid adherence to \"name tag protocol\".  I haven't seen her since and I feel badly now about that episode, but at the time, I am sure she was thinking that a call to the \"behavioral unit\" might be in order for this guest.  I found the location of that unit on a floor plan this trip .  It isn't something I really want to know.Tata for now. Hoping to report good news tomorrow!"},
{"title": "Back in the hospital again", "date": "Thursday, June 9, 2011", "text": "This morning I was sure this would be a \"boring\" day filled with food shopping and random stuff.  Not so!It quickly became something else.  Mom woke with problems.  We tried to head off another hospitalization with a visit from her home care doctor and nurse, and we filled some prescriptions! We were celebratory at the thought that we had dodged the \"hospital bullet\".But the fates had something else in store for us this day.  She went downhill fast.  By 4:30 it was evident that she needed to go to the ER.  EMTs were called, she was loaded into an ambulance and by 5:00 we were checking in at our local hospital ER. Now it is 11:00 pm.  We are still in the ER. We know she will spend a night or two in the hospital getting IV antibiotics. What we don't know is when we will get an actual hospital room.  The ER beds (they call them cots) are acutely uncomfortable.  The space bright as day and noisy.  There is no effort to adjust the surroundings for the late hour. And they aren't equipped to feed patients who are stuck in this limbo.  I sit on one hard plastic chair with my feet propped up on another plastic chair.  Both our butts are sore.You know you have been here too often when you know where all the ice machines are, where they keep the snacks, where to find your own pillows and linens, some of the staff know your face, you can answer their questions before they ask them.  It is sad to be so practiced at this.  But she needs to be here so we cope! As an aside: the Doritos I had for dinner were yummy!A second aside: I'd rather be food shopping! Mom would rather be sticking pins in her eyes. :-)  It is Thursday!Thursdays are grocery shopping days.  It is also senior discount day at our grocery store and we get 5% off our order because we are \"old\".  Well ... we are over 60 and I will take any benefit I can get for reaching that age - even a \"senior citizen\" discount.Grocery Shopping - it is one of those weekly events that we have done for years and years.  It begins with trying to create a menu for the week, (sometimes checking through cookbooks and sometimes just dumping whatever comes to mind on the menu,) checking the grocery store weekly sales, rooting through the pantry and freezer to see what we need, and so on.  All preparation for the act of cooking the daily meal each evening *sigh*.In my next life, I am going to have a cook who can do all that for me or at least marry someone who enjoys cooking. This is my least favorite thing to do each week.My husband and I have grocery shopped together our whole married lives.  I enjoy his company.  He seems to enjoy to process.  His favorite area of the store? The meat counter.  He heads there like a kid going into a candy shop.  He is primarily a beef-eater.  And he could live on ground beef if we were limited to just one choice.  My favorite area of the store?  Produce.  I love the colors and the smells of the space.  I love that I could eat any of these things WITHOUT cooking.  I really love that it is the healthiest part of the store.  The rest of the store?  It is just much too much.  I prefer a smaller grocery store with fewer choices, but in my city, big grocery stores are the norm.  In fact, we are scheduled to get a Wegman's next year (For those not familiar with this chain store - Wegman's is a super sized, up scale grocery store - the biggest of the big.  You can buy not only food, but the tools you need to make most things plus tons of stuff you didn't know you needed until you walked in the door. It seems to have a \"cult\" following among some.)  I enjoy visiting these jumbo super grocery stores as an outing, an occasional visit, a time to explore to see what new thingy I can find - but for regular everyday food shopping needs, give me a small grocery store every time. I must be in the minority in my city because we don't have any small grocery stores.The food shopping chores end with getting all the bags into the house and unpacked!  Now that doesn't sound like such a big deal, unless you remember that I have 20 steps into my house from the parking lot.  Today it is scheduled to be 100 degrees outside with poor air quality so it will be many sweaty and breathless trips into the house. And for some undefined reason, we always manage to leave something in the trunk of our car.  If we are lucky, it is a canned something.  Several years ago, however, we left a package of flank steaks that had been rolled  with butter, garlic and blue cheese and then sliced into patty sized servings.  We didn't find that package for a week!  But as the week progressed, we became aware of a stench - the kind of stench that says \"something has died in your car.\"  At some point I refused to get into the car until we could get rid of the smell.  By the time we found it, the package was green - ugh.  We found a public trash can to discard the offending meat into because I wouldn't put that smelly thing in our trash!! And it put us off flank steaks for a very long time.So today is grocery shopping day, something we have done about 2,184 times over 42 years!There should be a law against that!That will be our day - minus the green meat I hope!"},

And yet ...A few days ago I was heading out the door to spend quality time with my knitting group.  The day was sunny and comfortable ... and I was \"free\" to be with my friends.  All was right with the world.Except ... someone decided to \"take a tour of the inside of my car\" over night. When I opened to door, the inside of my car looked like this ...I stood there for a few minutes trying to process what I saw.  Could I have left the car like this?  Did my husband enter the car looking for something?  Stupid thoughts, of course, but an effort to put some kind of logic to what eyes were seeing.Thankfully the car wasn't damaged.  We must of left if unlocked over night - something we never do.  And we never keep anything in the car - just papers and stuff.  I did have some music in the car, and my husband commented: \"Guess they didn't like your taste in music 'cause everything is here.\"  :-)Apparently there has been a rash of this kind of \"crime of convenience\" ... all occured when the car was unlocked.  Some people have lost GPS equipment, cell phones,  iPods and stuff.  We escaped that consequence because we don't keep anything of value in the car.We were lucky.  No damage, nothing missing, and the car was still parked in the lot.  But it is an invasion of a type.  It is also a disappointment that our lovely neighborhood is not exempt from this kind of thing, and a lesson - never leave the car door or front door of your house unlocked."},

{"title": "Slump, dump, grump - it continues.", "date": "Sunday, June 5, 2011", "text": "Although it might not be entirely evident, I have been in a slump.  Feeling in the dump.  Sometimes like a grump!The slump started at the beginning 2010!  (See, I am good at hiding it.)To begin with, I wasn't knitting hardly at all.  (That is always a real bad sign.) Yes, I was still buying yarn (because I wasn't dead.) But the act of actually knitting took a major hit.And I have had crafting ADD. (I flitted from one hobby to the next.)  I kept my knitting-hand in but I started several other crafts - spinning and weaving mostly.  Started but stalled.  Finished projects???  Not so many.  2009 was my banner year for that.  And yet ... when I look at my spinning wheel, and the yarn I created I get a warm fuzzy feeling. I think, I need to make more time for that.  And when I look at my new loom and the 2 inches of weaving I created, I smile.  But sitting down to do these things still is a major struggle for me right now.  If I do anything I work on a vanilla sock, or I make more weave-it squares for the blanket I am working on. Both require no thought, no skill, no engagement.  But at least I am doing that.  Last year?  Nothing.I wasn't exercising as much.  I started Tai Chi in 2009, and I picked up walking at the end of 2010.  But both have been a struggle in  2011. Because Tai Chi was at a fixed time, I finally had to drop it. I could not make a fixed time class. I picked up Curves as a replacement, but it is struggle to get there as well.  And walking, well, that sort of fell off the radar entirely with the hospitalizations and the rehab for my mom.  *sigh*So today I was sitting on my couch like a lump in a dump ... in a grump!!  And I FORCED myself off the couch and out the door for a walk.  It was good. Walking never fails me.  I need to do the same tomorrow.But everything seems like an effort right now.  I know this is a phase that will pass, and I know that I get tripped up every time mom takes a nose-dive health-wise.  But I wish I wasn't always struggling to get \"back on the horse\"! She is doing better and I am now focusing on me again - pushing myself to do the things that I know are important for me.As far the rise and fall of life's hights and slumps go, this one has been the longest slump of my whole life.  It definitely has pushed the boundaries of my experience.  OK, my self-pity talk is now over.  Thanks for sticking around to the very end.Have you had a similar experience that you would like to share?  I would love to know that I am not some sort of an odd-ball in a normal world!Be back again soon."},

{"title": "3 Dog - 2 Cat Weekend - Day 3", "date": "Monday, May 30, 2011", "text": "Now you might have noticed that the cats seem to be absent.  They weren't.  You just have to know where to look.Max and Wally have a favorite place.  It is our bathroom, which is located as far as you can get from the living room where the dogs hang out.This spot is a favorite for several reasons: it is quiet there, it is far from the dogs, it is the space where Max gets his fluid treatments for his degenerative kidney disease (behind him is a medical sharps container for his needles) - which means many many treats are despensed here, and it is where they can hang out together.  They also have a litter box here and you might notice a white mug on the counter.  That is their bathroom water bowl.  They like their water out of a mug!  :-)But they aren't always hidden away.  In the morning, they enjoy sitting in the kitchen watching the birds on the balcony.  Max found a special place where he could hang out in the kitchen, but still be above the fray.He enjoys sitting on one of the kitchen chairs.  Here he is hanging out with Grimace nearby.  All is cool.  We can relax, stretch out our neck, be superior!He also enjoys sitting there with Meathead nearby.  Yes, these mutts are OK, reasonable, companionable!And here is Max with ... oh, guess not.  A shot of Milo's ears.EpilogueThese weekends now are pretty tame compared to last year when Milo was an uncontrolled baby. Last year there was much chasing around and nipping and cat hissing and dog barking.  This year those behaviors are much reduced.  He knows the rules and follows them about 70% of the time.  Huge improvement, really.  Now he is pretty much just one of the pack.  Enjoys eating his meals with his cousins, taking long morning walks with Grimace and Grandma and afternoon naps with everyone.He is a dear little soul."},
{"title": "3 Dog - 2 Cat Weekend - Day 2", "date": "Sunday, May 29, 2011", "text": "So the weekend starts with a nice calm walk with Grandma - Meaty and Grimace, enjoying their senior stroll to check  all the various pee spots in the neighborhood since their last visit.Then there is the meeting between Meaty and Milo.  It starts out as play, and evolves to overheated fatigue for Meaty and frustration that Meaty has pooped out for Milo. Meathead is an old guys and Milo is a young teen, so it is an admirable effort on his part to humor Milo.Night time typically looks like this - blow up mattresses across the living room floor for my daughter and I with each dog settling where they are most comfortable.  Getting settled for sleep takes time due to shuffling of sleeping positions.  In the early morning (3:00 am seems like a good time)  Meaty decides he needs to step outside for a short visit to empty his bladder.  It becomes a group visit with all 5 of us going outside.  As we stand in the quiet of the neighborhood when most normal people and animals (wild and domestic) are tucked into dream-land and the street sounds have totally disappeared, we wait for 3 pooches to do their business. Day time typically looks like this - napping all around!  After all, we need to rest up for the nights!!And there are the walks to the \"necessary\".And occasional visits with the neighbors. Milo (right) with Cleo, one of the neighbors\"Wow, girl, what happened to your legs?\"Meathead making a point.\"I don't know about you, grandma, but I am done here!\""},
{"title": "3 Dog - 2 Cat Weekend - Day 1 - Meet the Cast", "date": "Saturday, May 28, 2011", "text": "There are 5 family pets: the 3 dogs belong to my kids and the 2 cats belong to me and my husband. These 5 lords of the manor spend weekends with me during the spring, summer and fall.Now the mix of personalities are interesting.  Meathead (full name is Meathead Augustus) is the senior statesman English Bull Dog, first dog in the family, and he prefers to sit quietly on the couch perched on my daughter's lap. Not a big walker, Meaty goes out to pee and poop and the whole process (from leaving the couch and returning) takes about 5 minutes - less if there is rain. The cats ignore him.  He ignores the cats. He gets along with Grimace.  He tolerates Milo. His only troublesome eccentricity is that he will eat the cats' food if he can get to it, and he loves the \"special cat cookies\" he finds hidden in the \"cat cookie boxes\" - the boxes with the sand.  We try not to think about this when he kisses us.  He is not a barker. He enjoys is naps which involve maybe 22 hours out of ever 24. He likes to get everyone up between 3 and 4 in the morning for night time walks.  He uses the excuse that he is a senior canine with a weak bladder.Grimace (full name is Grimace Roberto Geronimo) is the second senior statesman Pug, second dog in the family, and he prefers to sit right by his grandmother (me) on the couch or go for long walks outside with his grandmother. He also ignores the cats, but Wally loves Grimace - in a kind of a questionable way.  Always rubbing up against him, wrapping his paws around him ...  and freaking out Grimace. Grimace love Meaty, but avoids Milo and the cats.Grimace has two troublesome qualities: he barks EVERY SINGLE TIME he hears dog bark or door bell ring on the TV - you can't imagine just how frequently that occurs until you have a canine pointing it out to you - loudly and sharply. And he can't seems to figure out that it is a make believe sound.   It can put you off TV. He also makes \"social statements\" in the house, for which he wears \"pooch pants\".  My son calls them camp trousers. Pugs like to wear \"clothes\" so this isn't a problem for him. Milo (full name is Milo, the Stud) is the \"baby\" at one year old, and the third dog to the family. He loves and plays everyone - to excess. Often he is isolated in the kitchen because he can't cool his jets on the playing. His favorite playmate is Meathead and any other dog that he can bully into playing with him. He barks alot at real and imagined things through the window. Milo loves the cats and has permanently destroyed his relationship with them because he hasn't learned the fine finesse of getting along with cats.  Milo also loves the couch especially when  his mom has Meathead on her lap.  He is the most cuddly of the 3 dogs.  He has excellent bladder control in the morning and would prefer to sleep in than go for a walk (an excellent quality if you want to sleep-in) ... I should have such bladder control!  At other times he can be alittle leaky - wearing his own version of pooch pants.Wally and Max, our cats (you can call them \"Sir\"), are acclimated to the dogs, sort of.  Dogs have been part of their lives since they were kittens.  But when faced with Milo's brand of \"friendly\", they say the most interesting cat swear words.  I don't know where they learned to talk like that.They don't seem to mind Meaty and Grimace.They are fully \"armed\" and have yet to put their paw down with wayward Milo. It's just a matter of time.So that is the cast of characters this weekend and for many weekends into the future. They are all different beings with their own personalities and requirements!  They are always \"mixing it up.\"  It makes for interesting weekends. (\"Interesting\" translates to sleepless, unexpected, farty, snorty, and noisy.)I love these weekends."},
{"title": "Milo Thursday - Road Trip", "date": "Friday, May 27, 2011", "text": "Eager to take back another piece of my life, I arranged to pick up Milo, my dear grand-dog, yesterday. This regular event happens most Thursdays - unless I am juggling a mom illness like I was during the last 4 weeks.The trip to Bethesda, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, DC, takes about 40 minutes from my house.  It is a pretty direct route - route 95 south to the Washington Beltway for several miles and then a few more miles into Bethesda. Yesterday was not a normal day.It started out fine - great actually.  I left the house at 2:00 and got to Milo's abode at 2:30.  At that point it fell apart.We weren't on the road 10 minutes, when Milo threw up!  A large yellowy bile kind of vomit with grass.  I managed to stay on the road, fold over the blanket to hide the offending ick and kept on.  Dogs eat grass, they throw up, no big deal.  Three minutes later, he was doing an encore!  But this time a piece of wood came up!  Yikes.  I pulled over and called my daughter.  After confirming he has been a bit of a chewer recently, I got back on the road.  My poor baby had the saddest face, but at least he seemed to be settled down. (Silly boy, stop eating random stuff!!)I got onto the Beltway for the quick trip home. Most locals know the Beltway is a parking lot during rush hour.  This wasn't rush hour - maybe it was 3:00.  The traffic slowed to a crawl.  Maybe 5 miles an hour with stop and go episodes.  I figured there was an accident.Never saw an accident.  Just lots of cars.I saw some vehicles on the side of the road  that had overheated, or had a flat tire, and a police car - but no accident.(Glad that cop isn't looking into my car like that.  Hands on the hips say alot. I suppose he would have pulled me over too if he saw me looking through a camera instead of the road.)    :-)We crawled along.  I would have made better time walking, but it was 96 degrees outside.  (And 30-45 miles is alot to walk even without a sick dog.)Finally the traffic began to break up as we got onto route 95 north.  I was happy - now we were moving.  And then we weren't. Darn!!  I began reading the ads on business vans.This guy \"Mallick\" is a plumber. In the lower right corner is the word \"Lick\" with a number.  I would not have used the word \"lick\" on a plumber's truck.  Lick and plumbing are not words you put together anywhere.ugh!Another plumber truck.  What do you think a \"certified back flow technician\" is?  At least he is getting paid for sitting on this road.(Right about here I began thinking that I needed to get more of a life.)Do these large trucks have to be so big? Or so close? Or so noisy? Or so many?Don't all these people have someplace else they could be? They are probably saying the same thing about me!Grandma, are we there yet?I finally took an early exit off route 95 - country roads - yeah!!And finally, my street!And my home!!!Finally, at 5:00 pm, we arrived.  Yes, the trip took me 30 minutes in one direction and 2 1/2 hours going back.And you know you have been on the road too long when you start reading the truck ads!  That was yesterday!  Today is the beginning of a 3-dog weekend: Milo, Meathead and Grimace.  And my daughter!  It should be fun!Hope you all have a fun holiday weekend."},

{"title": "Maryland Sheep and Wool", "date": "Saturday, May 21, 2011", "text": "There was a rousing chorus of voices to show my Sheep and Wool purchases!!So the truth about the \"rousing chorus\" is that it was one voice, DebD,.  For me, it doesn't take more than one voice.  I visited her blog, Deb On The Run.  You should too.  Very nice.  Thanks Deb.  I am thrilled you asked.So here is the story and pictures.I plan all year for the Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival.  I make sure I keep the day free, I save my money (my birthday is in April so that works out well), and I have a list of what I am looking for.  I usually attend with my cousins and my sister.  This year I was going with my one cousin.  I am happy to go by myself, but it is extra special to share it with others who love this event as much as I do.Of course, all my plans changed quickly when my Mom got sick in April, was admitted to the hospital, and then a rehab stay. Mom was discharged from rehab the morning of the Fair.  But luckily everything fell into place easily.  I scheduled mom's discharge for 8:30 am.  The ambulance arrived early (that was a surprise), and mom was home in her new living room chair by 9:15 am.  It went like clock work.My daughter was there to keep mom company while we went to the Fair.  We still had to make a trip to the pharmacy on her behalf, but we were on the road by about 10:30 am.  There were no backups on the roads - usually typical on Fair morning.  We pulled into the large grassy field filled with cars as far as you could see.  I took a quick turn to the right hoping for an early departer - and I was gifted exactly that.  Someone pulled out and I pulled in.  We were not far from the entrance.  As we walked towards the gate, I was thankful that everything fell into place, including the beautiful weather, on this one day of the year I look forward to all year long.I didn't have my camera with me (as I originally planned to do) nor a shopping list, but here are the snap shots of the things I got.The first thing I purchased was one of the Fair's bags.  It is a nice roomy canvas bag with their logo.  In the back it had a nice outside pocket.  I also purchased 2 Fair T shirts with the same logo.  Turns out this bag is pretty handy for my second purchase - my Rigid Hettle loom (that you can see peeking out of it).I settled on a Kromski Harp Weaving loom. Here is a picture of it folded up. And sitting on its side, it fits pretty well in my new bag.I love Kromski products.  I also have a Kromski spinning wheel.  This loom has nice features that make it pretty to look at compared to other looms.  This is pretty typical of Kromski products. They take time to build some style into their products.Here is the loom opened up and ready to weave. In fact you can see my first efforts.  My cousin spent time putting the loom together, getting it warped up and then instructing me on weaving. Everyone should have a cousin like her.  Without her guiding hand, this would have taken me forever to put together and warp.  The weaving was easier than I thought.I have been using my free time to finish mom's shawl from my hand loom, and to complete my own scarf and matching hat from the left over yarns.  Soon I will be working on my Kromski loom again.I thought it might make sense to purchase some sort of instructional material for the loom.  My cousin doesn't live close enough to \"pop over\" to help me when I get stuck.I haven't had a chance to watch it, but I will.  I did the same thing with my spinning wheel - got a DVD.I find that I can absorb only so much in one sitting.  I am sure I will re-discover a number of helpful hints when I watch this DVD ... probably stuff my cousin told me and it went right over my head.Another fun purchase was a Yarn Bowl.   I am not actually sure that is what they call it.  But it functions alot like a basket, but it is ceramic.  It holds a ball of yarn and the yarn is fed through a slot as you need it.  The advantage is that the yarn ball doesn't roll away as you are working with it.   I have seen these bowls before, but never one so beautiful.  This maker not only put effort into surface decorations, she added another feature to the back.She included a small place where you can hold knitting notions.  It took us quite a while to pick out one from all the many beautiful choices provided. I also got 8 ounces of BFL and Silk for spinning. This picture doesn't do this justice. It is just beautiful.  And, it is very soft to the touch.I think I will hold on to this for awhile until I am a better spinner.I also visited my favorite yarn vendor: Brooks Farm out of Lancaster, Texas.  I purchase something from them every year.This year they had a new product called Willow.  It is composed of 70% Super Wash wool and 30% Bamboo in a worsted weight.  I picked a brick red color that is variegated to a brownish dark red.  Very nice.  It isn't at all scratchy and has a very light feel to it.  I had a picture, but my computer filed it away and I can't find it.  I also purchase a few patterns from them.Finally I purchased 2 hand crafted mugs from different vendors.  I will show off these mugs in a different postings. And I got some bees wax skin cream for my daughter.  It had a citrusy scent.  I think that pretty much sums up my purchases this year.  I want to thank my daughter again for staying with her grandmother while I attended the fair.  I knew mom was in good hands with her.  And it made my day pretty care free.All in all, the day was perfect.  The weather was just beautiful, my cousin was with me, I had mom home - in time for Mother's Day the next day, my mom was in my daughter's capable hands, and I got some really fun stuff at my favorite fair. It doesn't get much better than that."},

The shawl was made from a hand loom by Hazel Rose.  It is a 12\" loom.  I have several others and they are beautifully made, fun to work with, and make a beautiful fabric.  Be sure to check out their web site.Mom is especially pleased with her shawl.  She watched me make it and frequently commented on how pretty the fabric was that I was creating.  She never asked who it was for.  I think you will agree that the colors are perfect for her.  She also looks happy - happy to be home and getting better.The sweater underneath the shawl I knitted for her several years ago.  Turns out it is a pretty good match for the shawl."},
{"title": "A Growth Moment ...", "date": "Wednesday, May 18, 2011", "text": "You will be witness to a HUGE personal growth moment in this posting!!I mean really really BIG!!You see, May 2, after the dust began to settle on my mother's hospitalization and rehab, I discovered I had 682 backlog postings to catch up on.  I was aghast!  But I firmly believed that I could catch up on my reading over a few days.  I know a few of you posted \"words of blogging wisdom\" advising me to just start with the current day and go forward, skipping the older blog postings.  Of course, being a type A personality, I felt differently, had committed to visiting at my blog friends' sites and seeing what I had missed.  Using Google I ordered by backlog to show the oldest posting first so I could work forward in order as I caught up.  (You may roll your eyes now!)Over the last week ... between medications, weight checks, blood pressure and oxygen checks, exercise sessions, visiting nurses, physical and occupational therapies ... and between vacuuming 'cause with that many people in the house, I wanted them to know I was a good housekeeper (go figure!) ... between all that stuff, I probably visited about 100 postings.  Yes, most were quick visits, a few rare comments left, some were skipped if the topic didn't appeal, but I touched down about 100 times.And then today I decided to check and see how many were still outstanding.  Maybe 500-ish, or if I was real lucky 400 something.  Not even close!912And so, with great flourish and renewed blog wisdom, I am going to stop counting the back log and reorder my blog list to show the current postings first.  I will do my best to ignore the old stuff.You will notice that there is no promise to ignore the old stuff, just that I will do my best.*sigh*"},
{"title": "Life returning ... new normal", "date": "Tuesday, May 17, 2011", "text": "Life is returning to a new normal.Being back at home has been such a blessing for both mom and I.  I know deep in my heart that we will need to step outside of these 4 walls and into an emergency room once again, but I am hoping for a few months of grace to recharge my batteries and give mom a few months of peace while getting better.Meanwhile, \"back at the ranch\", our lives are back to a new normal, just like mom's health status.  We sleep in our own beds, eat meals at our dinner table, watch Dancing With the Stars every Monday and Tuesday night.  But our new normal has a few layers on it. Our house has frequent home care visitors. I vacuum the house alot now :-).  The medication schedule is different.  No missing even one pill - I have missed a few of my own but she gets all of hers.  Every morning mom has her weight and blood pressure electronically transmitted to Johns Hopkins Home Care.  Think about that one - having your weight taken every single day and then announced!  Yikes! And she has to exercise. Of course, right now her exercise routine is minimal, but it must be done.  My exercise routine?  A total bust. And other normal things are beginning to filter back into our lives.  I started walking on Monday.  It felt like total freedom to step outside the house and just walk anywhere I want. And even just 2 walks makes a difference in how I feel.  Next hurtle is to return to Curves.  I'll be starting over on the simple circuit, but that is OK.   The grand-dogs are starting to make appearances in my life again. Saturday my son brought Meathead and Grimace over for a day-long visit.  I took them out for a walk - and Meathead - a couch potato dog - decided that we needed to check out ALL our walking paths.  I guess three weeks of missed dog walks with grandma had taken its toll on him. Even Grimace - who usually is the walker - was ready to come back in before Meathead.  It was too funny!I finished mom's woven shawl.  It was supposed to be finished for Mother's Day, but my days were filled with other stuff.  :-)  Other more important mom stuff was happening.  She was so excited and pleased to find out the shawl I had been working on for months (and she admired regularly) was for her. I had enough woven yarn left over for a scarf for me and a hat.  We will be twins!! The yarn is beautiful and I want to use it all up.I am also clawing my way back to fiber pursuits and reading.  I attended the Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival (thank you my dear dear daughter for grandma-sitting that day). I purchased a loom that my very special cousin helped me set up.  I purchased other stuff as well, but I will spare my non-fiber obsessed readers the list of what I got.  Working on fiber projects takes focus and when I am stressed - like the last month - I can't focus on them.And finally I am back to blogging.  It helps me to write my thoughts out, to focus on the good things in my life, to visit other blogs (I am way behind on that - but I'll get there.), and to \"hear\" the voices of my distant blog friends through comments on my blog.  I am not sure why this works so well, but it does.  Thank you for sticking with me during this absence.So I am grabbing back the pieces of my life one day at a time.It is a new normal for mom's health, and a new normal for my life - but it is normal.  And I am grateful for it.My glass is half-full!!"},
{"title": "Still Standing", "date": "Monday, May 16, 2011", "text": "Are you a reflective person?  Do you look back at the course your life, and more specifically, a difficult time,  and ponder how you got to this point?  And do you reflect on how well things are going, how happy or sad you are, how things will play out in the future? I've done a little of that kind of reflection this week.It has been a tough 6 months. My mom had 4 separate hospitalizations - all sudden events, and all by way of ambulance and ER. (I really hate the ER.)She had 2 sub acute rehabilitation experiences totaling 3 weeks.She had 4 home care experiences - the last of which we are doing now.I lost a close life long relationship - a relationship that on the surface looks the same unless it is examined closely.  Trust has disappeared.What I have learned:I am tired often, discouraged sometimes and disappointed frequently.  But I am not broken.Trusting my gut - based on experience - has been the correct move time and time again.I am strong enough to demand action and accountability when it is lacking - especially in regards to my mother's care.I love being home.  Spend 3 weeks away in medical facilities, sleeping in your street clothes, on couches or on rubber recliners, eating food from hospital cafeterias, and you too, will develop a love of your home.  I am happy to be here - to just be!  Those who say something can't be done, should get out of the way of those who are doing it.Despite everything, I am still a happy and optimist person.  My life is successful because of that attitude.  I choose optimism!What I am grateful for:The right people have been in the right place when I needed them most.All but one voice has confirmed my actions and supported my choices with regards to my mother.  Those voices run the gamete of family, friends and medical professionals. Those folks know who they are. My mother is still alive and living with me.  So many times in the last weeks, I have heard folks say how lucky I am to still have my mother and to be able to support her during this time.  I, too, have felt that way, but it is nice to know that this value is shared by others.I am grateful for my 13 years in the medical field. It gave me the knowledge and judgement as well as the understanding of reasonable expectations for medical care.  It also gave me many personal connections in my local community to high quality physicians and services.  I have benefited greatly from that experience. So has my mother.What I accept:No matter what you do, the slow decline of elderly marches towards its inevitable conclusion.My mother's needs will continue to grow due to rapidly declining health.Only one person in her family can handle this daily responsibility - that falls to me.My choices are not the choices of others.  It doesn't make me wrong ... One day I may be forced to move my mom to another more appropriate place.  It will be hard - gut wrenching, actually.  But when her care requires such a move, I will do it. And in the end ... I will still be standing!"},

Maybe I just need less sleep.  Hard to know, but sleep ... at night, can be a hard thing to achieve.  And sleep during the day (a.k.a. nap) is impossible.I am a bit of a control freak!  Sleep cannot be controlled.  I can't will myself to go to sleep.  I can't just determine that at 10:00 pm, I will be asleep and I will stay asleep till morning.  This sleep issue can be a really a problem for a control freak!Maybe it is a problem for control freaks because sleep is about letting go, relaxing and accepting the idleness of rest as an important goal for health!

It is fitting because as focused as I was on completing this challenge on time and ahead of the pack ... life sent me a curve ball that even my control freak nature couldn't overcome.

I am now a \"collector\" of yarn.  You see, my current \"stash\" (a knitter's term for yarn they own, but have not knit up), my current stash is more of a collection in size and diversity. I enjoy knitting, but I also enjoy the ownership.  I love being able to go down to my basement and \"shop\" in my own \"yarn store\", where nothing is for sale, where I am the only customer, where I don't have to wait for a sale.  I won't outlive all my current yarn stash.  I once figured out that knitting 5,000 yards a year, I could knit for 23 years without purchasing yarn.  And at that time I was appalled!  Ridiculous to have so much yarn, I thought!  Maybe I should get professional help to curb my desire to acquire more??Nah!  That was one stupid idea and I dismissed quickly.  Now it is a collection.  I am happy and proud to have it.  I love every skein.  I am a yarn collector.  So much better a term than\"Yarn Horder\"!!:-)"},
{"title": "X - is for the spot - X marks it.", "date": "Thursday, April 28, 2011", "text": "(Posted on May 1 for April 28, 2011 - A to Z)So the letter X was a bit of a challenge.  For days all I could think of was \"X marks the spot\".  I resisted but finally decided, why not!!I googled \"X Marks the Spot\" and discovered a meaning and origin I never knew for this phrase. When I used this phrase, I always thought a pirate map with a big X marking the location of treasure. And that is one of its meanings. But it has a more dismal origin.According to online Urban Dictionary it says: What is said upon finding your target has been marked out.Derived from an X on pirate treasure maps.The phrase was put into common usage by the British army, who performed executions by marking a piece of paper with a black X and positioning it on the heart of someone sentenced to death.  The acting officer would say \"X marks the spot\" and the firing squad would shoot the X.Yikes! I don't know about you, but #3 gave me pause.  A colorful cartoony pirate map always came to mind when I said those words.  Not now.  Doesn't it make you wonder the origins of other commonly used phrases?  Curiosity might make you check, but a darker discovery might make it far less fun."},
{"title": "W - is for Walk the Talk", "date": "Wednesday, April 27, 2011", "text": "(Posted May 1 for April 26, 2011 A to Z)I am a big believer in \"Walk the Talk\".  Actions speak louder than words. Put your money where your mouth is.Being a full time care giver for a declining elderly person is really a test of that idea.  It is alot like raising a child (which I did twice), but raising children moves forward, builds, matures and creates an independent being.  Care giving of an elderly person moves in the opposite direction.  Backward steps occur frequently, forward progress (like in rehab), never return someone who is 85 to their previous level of function, but it does allow them to return to normal living ... a new normal for them. And that is the challenge of \"walking the talk\" in this care giving role.  Being able to accept the downward slope of progress, accepting the new normal for a loved one, and continuing to walk this path is hard.  Heartbreaking at times.But it is a debt I owe to the mother who raised me, who helped me survive in a dysfunctional family, and who had a hand in making me who I am today.  She was far from perfect, but she lived in a situation that I could not tolerate - until she was widowed!  And when I come to the end of this walk, and begin another, I will have no regrets for my actions during this time.  I will have done my very best to make her last years good and as healthy as possible.No regrets!!"},
{"title": "V - is for Vigilance", "date": "Tuesday, April 26, 2011", "text": "(Posted May 1 for April 26, 2011 - A to Z)Vigilance was not my original topic for V.  But after the hospitalization and the current rehab, Vigilance is all I have been doing.The role of a caregiver in a medical setting is pretty much to inform, to be vigilant, to ask questions, to be vigilant, to monitor, to be vigilant, to be persistent, to be vigilant, to be patient, and to be vigilant.  Did I mention Vigilance??It began with a trip to hospital ER with her shortness of breath.  Her history and current problem are repeated, and repeated and repeated as each new medical person enters the ER room (I am not sure why they have medical charts.) Sprinkled between those repeats are my questions, making sure they haven't slipped something in to her treatment that she is allergic to or cannot tolerate. And to monitor the ongoing treatment, to report her ongoing symptoms, to request changes to treatment (frequently - because asking once doesn't seem to count).And that was just the hospital.  Rehab has been more of the same!  Not with medications so much. They seem to be able to read the chart!  But her diet was wrong (no salt means no salt - not just taking the salt packet off the tray) and that took 4 days to correct.  Congestive Heart Failure most definately is a salt free diet!!  And then there is the vigilance of keeping mom's spirits up.  She tends towards self-pity and discouragement - and if I was 85 and frustrated beyond measure and afraid, I might have alittle of that myself.  But thankfully she has a daughter who has no patience for that, who reminds her daily that she is one lucky lady - who has family who is with her constantly through this trial, that she is healthier than most of the people in rehab, that she is getting well, that she is in a beautiful facility (believe me, they have some rehabs that are terrible), that she will be going home (some people live here and won't be going home.)  Now all that great stuff doesn't come without a price - she needs to work!  No work and she stays longer.We have had that conversation several times, sort of a tough love talk. She is not happy that I am now saying to her - oh, no, you can button your pajama tops yourself, you can adjust your own bed, you know how to work that TV remote.  Vigilance.  Persistence.  Reminders that her glass is half full!Anyway, that is my life now!  Thank God I am good at Vigilance!!!Oh, and did I mention that I am pretty tired?  That goes with being a caregiver too - but I already did the letter T.I want my life back, I want her life back, and she will work and improve if only to shut me up!!:-)"},

{"title": "T - is for Thunder Storms and Rescue Missions", "date": "Saturday, April 23, 2011", "text": "I love big weather events.  The most common weather event on the East Coast of the USA are thunder storms. We can count on several in the fall and spring, and sometimes even in the summer. This year we even had a snow thunder storm.The bigger and louder the better. I love to stand by the window and just take it in.  It is a reminder that we live on an ever changing planet with its own agenda. Humans sometimes forget in the small busyness of their individual lives that our Earth is still changing and developing - in very big ways - not necessarily all the time, but when it does show its muscle with dramatic weather, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes ... all other human events are temporarily stopped and we pay attention to our earth.One night a big, big thunderstorm had descended on our community.  I was enjoying the sound and noise of it all when a lightening strike landed right behind our town home.  The boom was enormous. The light created was almost blinding.  It startled us in its massiveness.  And then the unexpected happened.  Our neighbor's alarm system became activated and the horn started its very loud wailing.  Now our neighbors at the time were renters - a single woman and her young son.  We thought the alarm system had been disabled by the owners when they moved out.  We were friends with the owners, and I knew how to disarm their system.  We also knew the horn would blow for 6 minutes, then turn off. That is what we knew.  What we didn't know - was what the renters knew!!So we waited and waited.  The alarm horn was almost as loud as the storm and the horn wasn't even in our house.   The lightening kept flashing.  It was a long 6 minutes for us.  And when the horn didn't stop after 6 minutes, we got concerned.  We waited another 5 minutes wondering what we should do. That horn kept going (and so did the storm).So my son and I suited up  and went next store. From door to door, it is about 30 feet. We knocked. Nothing.  We could see lights.  We knocked louder.  Nothing.  We banged ... finally they could hear us and opened the door. We were two drowned rats, but I remember that our neighbors were sure glad to see us.  They knew nothing about alarms.So I confidently approached the key pad and used the code. Nothing.  I tried again.  Nothing, again.  The horn was deafening.  The system was fried!  Non-responsive, but very very loud. We went downstairs to the control box - opened it up. Lots of wires.  It wasn't clear which one of the wires controled the horn, so started pulling all the wires.  Finally the horn went silent.  The storm continued, but it was such a relief to get that horn off that we forgot about the storm.  To keep the wires from accidentally touching, we all chewed some gum and put bits of gum on the loose ends (my son's idea - he was about 16 at the time.)This is the closest I ever got to a \"rescue mission in a storm\".  It wouldn't make the national news but we made a difference to two very upset people.I feel I need to close with a video of a  really big storm I found on You Tube.  It occurred in South Dakota in July of 2010. This storm just looked plain scary - like something out of a movie.  I have never seen anything like it.  (I sure would love to!) Check it out. You won't be sorry."},

{"title": "R - is for Royality", "date": "Thursday, April 21, 2011", "text": "I am a closet Royalty Watcher. English Royalty.  I know it is a little silly and probably a tad juvenile, but there it is!  I am fascinated by all of it: a nation that supports a royal family, long histories of royal families, the wonderful clothes, and the activities of their daily lives. And why in the 21st Century do we still have royal families when clearly their function as rulers has pretty much disappeared?Their lives are different. Born into a life style, and a job, and a family with a bigger-than-life history, and a massive expectation for their future - isn't that one heck of a lot to be born into? How do you build your own life knowing that your choices are limited to the \"family business\" and that your children's lives must fit that plan as well, and their children's children, and so on.  What must living that kind of life be like?  I find it fascinating.And my enjoyment goes beyond the current royal family.  I love the Tudor history and the movies about King Henry VIII, and all his wives. And who doesn't know the story of his children, most pointedly, Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen.  And then there is Queen Victoria, another big famous Royal family. And now we have the current royal family - House of Windsor: another Elizabeth (who appears to be going for the record as a ruler), a prince in waiting (and waiting, and waiting - poor Charles), a princess deceased (a people's princess - Diana), two handsome, charming and well-balanced sons (William and Harry, thank you, Princess Diana), and a commoner-soon-to-be-princess and eventually Queen (Kate, dear Kate, have you really thought this thing through), and, ta-da ... a royal wedding on April 29th!  And about that wedding ...  I want to know about the dress and the wedding rings (he isn't wearing one, did you know that?), and the guests, and the ceremony, and the parade (there will be a parade right?), and all the pictures, and ... oh, maybe I go on too much!So were do you stand on royalty!

{"title": "P - is for Pestilence", "date": "Tuesday, April 19, 2011", "text": "Pestilence is such a juicy word, don't you think?  I mean, how often does one use \"pestilence\" in daily conversation?  I don't think I have ever used it - hence the need to use it now. Pestilence, pestilence, pestilence.When I hear that word I think of medieval times, when pestilence was a problem.  Is that why we don't use it?  It is an \"old\"  or archaic word that has fallen into disuse because it doesn't describe our world today?Then I got to thinking ... is the word pestilence - what I think it is.  What does it exactly mean?  Could I use it in a sentence if I had to?  or wanted to?  or strived to?  hmmm... maybe not in the 21st century.  How to know!Right, get a dictionary - see what Webster says about this word.  Luckily, after much searching, I discovered we had a dictionary. It is a behemoth of a dictionary.  Lets see how impressed you are with my dictionary.  It is the:Dictionary Definition Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary2,347 pages, thumb indexed 320,000 definitions19 encyclopedic supplements 3,000 illustrations full color maps of the world  Deluxe Second Edition $79.951983(pocket edition)joke, Ha! After I dusted it off I was a bit reflective. 1983! That may have been when we got this book - and I am just now using it! I must have known 28 years ago, I was going to need a dictionary sometime - and now is the time. :-)And the cover price was almost $80 - a lot of money now and more money in the 1980s when we were a struggling young couple with 2 small kids. The book is at least 6 inches thick and you could break a few bones if you dropped it on someone's foot.  And I never used until I looked up \"pestilence\".  Do you think I got my money's worth?  Well, I think pestilence is at least $80 word, don't you?I discovered the word has 3 definitions:1.  any virulent or fatal contagious disease (kind of what I thought)2. an epidemic of such a disease; especially, the bubonic plague. (getting interesting)3. anything, as a doctrine, regarded as harmful or dangerous (now we are talk'en)The sentence they provided was: Power is like a desolating pestilence. Yes ... this is definitely a 21st century word!Note:  Today is my birthday.  Maybe I should have chosen a different topic, like Present or Party for P. No ... pestilence is so much more interesting!!<\"VersatileBloggerAward.png\">The Versatile Blogger Award Gosh, this is really something.Shocking really.I really wanted one - but now I have two.

Me!And I thought - why not write my Obituary!I can hear the chorus of readers now!!\"HEAVENS,\" you say, \"why would you want to do that? Isn't that depressing? morbid? odd? premature?\" Yes, I am hoping it is premature. :-)  And it may be a little unusual. But a resounding NO to the other stuff!  Not depressing or morbid.I consider it a reality check.  My obituary is what I want people to know about me - and remember me for after I am gone, AND, creating it now gives me a chance to see just how close I am to those things. I mean, if I died tomorrow ... would I be able to use this Obituary!!!According to Wikipedia an obituary is:A news story that reports the recent death of a person, typically along with an account of the person's life and information about the upcoming funeral. The part I have problems with is \"an account of the person's life\".  People always take that to mean the following:Where were they born?Where did they live during their life?Where did they live at the time of their death?Where did they go to school and what degrees did they attain?What did they do professionally?What awards did  they achieve?What hobbies did they have?Who survives them?Bor - ing! Really, who cares about that stuff after you are dead.  Think about it.  Strangers reading the newspaper don't care where you went to school, what degrees you were awarded, how professionally stacked you are - I mean, used to be! And your family already knows this stuff.  And the deceased person - is that really how they want to be remembered - with an impersonal listing of accomplishments? Yes, I have an advanced degree, yes, I had responsible jobs. Yes, I had some worthwhile achievements - No,I don't care to share them. They are just not who I am.Here is how I want \"the account of my life\" to be remembered.  The black bold print are the actual words I want to use in my Obituary.  The blue and red print is my assessment of how close I am to the words.Elaine (aka Retired Knitter):-)Born: xx/xx/xxDied: xx/xx/xx(Dates should equal out to a nice age like say 35, or maybe something note worthy like 110.  My Obituary - my rules!)Daughter, Wife, Mother, Friend(maybe someday Grandmother could be addedhope, hope, hope)Always LovedThat one I nailed.  I love easily.  Makes it easy to hurt me as a result.Always LaughedBlessed with the happiness gene.  Seems whatever plows me down, I get back to happy eventually.Some times it takes longer than others to recover, but it is my \"norm\".Always CaredI have done my care-giving best for 3 elderly relatives. I have cared for 2 great kidsand they turned out pretty fabulous.  Just ask them!I have cared for my husband and family - even when they acted badly.I was not always perfect in the caring department, but I \"walked the talk\" most certainly.Learned PatienceNot when it counts. My mother tests this quality every single day.Learned Forgiveness Forgiving a hurt is very, very hard for me.I am pretty good at \"forgetting\", but \"forgiving\"?  Tough one.Learned TrustI used to trust without restraint.Not so much anymore.  Got burned.Another toughie.Most Happy When Knitting or Sitting With My Granddogs.Most Proud Of Her KidsCan't improve on that.So until I can rid of all that red print, I can't use this Obituary - and I can't die.  And, besides, I have enough yarn to last me until I am 94 - another 30 years.  I'll be sticking around. (or at least until my next birthday, whichever comes first.)Oh, wait, that is tomorrow!!!"},

And I will be standing on April 30 with a minimum of 26 postings under my belt.  But I have made a discovery.  A discovery that none of my blog friends warned me about.  (Where were you guys????)The REAL challenge of this month isn't writing the daily posts to your own blog ... it is keeping up with the bogs you follow!So now I am asking ....Do you read every one's blog?Do you comment all the time?If you get behind do you delete or just wait until you have more time ... say a week to catch up?How much time do you spend on blogging each day - the whole process: creation, reading, commenting!!Do you do something I haven't mentioned to keep from drowning?Inquiring minds (of new bloggers) ... ok, it is just me, I want to know.(Throw me a life-line for cry'en out loud!!):-)(PS - I love you guys.  Don't stop posting!  Don't stop following! Don't stop reading!  Don't stop commenting!  Don't stop!  I'll deal.)"},
{"title": "N - is for Nostalgia", "date": "Saturday, April 16, 2011", "text": "I think nostalgia is a dangerous thing.Wikipedia defines nostalgia as \"yearning for the past, often in idealized form\".      That pretty much defines what my life has been for the last year - yearning for the \"idealized\" part of my past.I know all the cliches.Life is about changes.  Nothing stays the same.  We all change.  When life sends you lemons, make lemonade.  I know all that! But when I think about the past - and it is idealized I recently discovered - I can't help but be nostalgic for what I preceive to have lost.Even if it was not as good as I remember, I would like maybe one of these back.A time when:My husband had his full eye sight and could drive. We could hike and enjoy the outdoors.Mom was able to think and function on her own.  She didn't need a caregiver.Broken family relationships were whole.I wasn't pre-diabetic.My grand-dog meathead wasn't epileptic.I vacationed and spent holidays with my extended family.I could sleep through the night without interruption.Of course, nostalgia steals from me the wonderful things I have now.My husband still has sight.We have a happy and healthy marriage despite the extreme pressures of the past year.My mom is still alive and living with me.I have a wonderful family generally - better than most despite recent losses. I have my health.My adult kids are part of my life. They are successful and happy.I have friends and family that have been there for me ... and not just when things are going well.Meathead's seizures are finally - after many years - controlled with meds.My son is engaged to be married to a beautiful and caring woman who fits our family perfectly.I have more wonderful bullets here - than in my nostalgic first list.The word nostalgia has a nice homey feel to the ear.  But when the emotion of nostalgia is examined under the microscope, it is an emotion that puts you at a disadvantage.  It takes rather than gives.  It is only good when looking in photo albums, not in living your life.So my mantra?Wanting what you cannot have from the past (or the future) - is bad.  Focus on the now - and enjoy it!  I work on that every single day."},
{"title": "M - is for Mortifying Maine Memories", "date": "Friday, April 15, 2011", "text": "One of my favorite places on earth is Bar Harbor, Maine and Acadia National Park. If you like rugged coast lines, wilderness, hiking trails, horse drawn wagon rides, beautiful lakes, breath-taking views ... you need to visit this place.  Some of my very best memories were created there, as well as one \"Mortifying Memory.\"The story begins with great expectations!(Pictured: view of Jordon Pond - 1998)On our first trip in 1998 my husband and I discovered Jordon Pond. The walk/hike is measured about 3 1/4 miles around.  The guide books suggested allowing 2-2 1/2 hours to walk it due to the rough terraine.Today there is a restored trail around the lake. It is more of a walk than a hike.  The trail is rated a 1 on a scale of 1 to 5 - with 5 being strenuous.  (The Precipice, a vertical cliff climb in Acadia, is rated 5.) (Picture: gravel path early in the walk, easy walk, 1998)But things were different on our first trip.  Only about 30% of the trail was graded and graveled.  The rest was a mix of tangled roots, raised boards for keeping hikers off the delicate ecosystems, some forest paths, and there were about 5 large man-made rock falls that you had to climb over.  The guide book rated the first 30% of the trail as a 1 - and a the balance of the walk as 3-4 in difficulty.We were regular walkers, we read the guide books carefully, the hike was vertical, we had the right shoes, and we had the attitude.  We were full of ourselves.  We would conquer Jordan Pond.(Pictured: part of the trail that was uneven and hard walking.).We walked the easy part first.  We were passing folks.  We were commenting on their sandals, or inappropriate clothing, and how they wouldn't make it the whole way around.  We were \"experienced\".  Then we got to the more difficult parts.  First came the roots. There were deep ruts everywhere.  Lots of them.  It was very difficult on the ankles. It was slow going but we were careful.  We watched many people turn back because of that first section. Then came the raised boards.  They went on for quite a while - through some beautiful sections of woods.  It was quiet and peaceful - and we didn't see many people, because many had turned back. It wasn't difficult to walk the boards, but you did need to pay attention to your foot placement.  We then came to our first section of boulders.  The boulders were several hundred feet across, and traveled a fair distance up the hill and down to the water.  You couldn't avoid them.  And, of course, we weren't going back.  At this point our self-esteem was involved.  We pushed on.  We were a little tired, but very confident that we could manage this.  (Pictured: Entrance of the first rock fall. Deceivingly passable .  Later on, when I was tired and not thinking of taking pictures, the rocky terraine became more difficult.  In this picture, just beyond are trees in the distance were larger boulders.  It got harder fast.)And so it repeated (and it seemed like a million times ... but I exaggerate).  Root sections, raised board sections, forest paths, rock falls.  We were getting tired.  Very tired. The travel was getting pretty darn slow as well.  We were thirsty.  (No ... us \"experienced hikers\" did not have water,  or a snack,  or good sense. )  We didn't know how much trail was ahead, but I had to rest.  My legs were shaky.  I felt a little weak.  I needed a breather.  So we sat on a large bolder in the middle of a rock fall enjoying the beautiful lake, bone tired (and I was silently hoping I could get to the end without twisting something.)And then we got a mortifying reality check.To our left, 3 older women started the climb cross the rock fall coming toward us. They had been traveling not too far behind us apparently.  Two women were walking on either side of a very elderly woman. She was bent over, struggling a bit with the rocks. She was using with 2 walking sticks.  I wanted to jump up to help, but ... the legs were a bit rubbery. No point embarrassing myself.  We struck up a conversation as they neared us.  Apparently the very elderly woman was celebrating her 80th birthday that day.  She had walked Jordon Pond on her birthday for years.  Her companions were \"younger\" - one 68 and one was 76 and they were here to help her make the trip around the pond.  The Birthday Girl shook off my offer to assist her (thank God - it would have been most embarrasing if she had to help me off my boulder!).  She said she was fine.  She wished us a good day.  And on the three of them went without a backward glance.My husband and I sat there for a few minutes pondering what had just happened.  I jumped up!  I remember throwing out comments like - \"lets get going\", \"rest time is over\", \"hup-hup!!\" or something stupid like that. I did not make any further comments about being tired, or thirsty or hungry!!!  When we caught up with them, we cheerfully waved our good wishes and sprightly moved on past them. We were not recovered by a long shot, but in 1998, we were about 30 years younger than the birthday girl, and action on our part seemed ... (searching for a word here) ... REQUIRED!Needless to say, we beat the 3 elderly ladies back to the beginning of the trail,  but I am guessing just barely.  :-)  And we did it all in a \"speedy\" 4 1/2 hours!  Epilogue:On our second trip to Jordan Pond (1999), my husband and I were once again walking the trail.  He slipped off the boards and broke his ankle.  I have a feeling that the spirits of Jordon Pond were putting us in our place!!  Rightfully so.We don't have many pictures of our 1999 trip because we spent most of it in the Bed and Breakfast with his foot elevated!  (Pictured: My husband and I returned a third time to Jordon Pond - 2005.  No broken bones and we made it around the pond without problems.  This time we prepared.  I wasn't going to be embarrased by another 80 year old woman with 2 elderly companions.One other note - the picture shows we had walking sticks and water.  We learned.)(Pictured: Sadly, we lamented that the trail restoration was completed by 2005. Rangers told us that injuries around Jordon Pond dropped dramatically once it was completed.)I miss the \"old\" trail. :-)"},
{"title": "L - is for Laughter", "date": "Thursday, April 14, 2011", "text": "When people are laughing, they're generally not killing each other.~Alan AldaYou may have noticed that I prefer humor and laughter to more serious subjects.  Laughter and a humorous approach to life is important to me.  It is how I communicate best.I wasn't born with a particularly sophisticated sense of humor.  Our family didn't have much to laugh about.  But when I met the man who is now my husband ... I was instantly drawn to his witt and ability to make you laugh.  It was a very important trait a person I hoped to spend my life with.  We have had many many belly laughs together.  And thankfully, he has passed that sterling trait on to both our children.I sincerely believe the Alan Alda quote says it all.  If we had more laughter in our world, we wouldn't be killing each other.  So I will end the posting with a joke - one that made me double over in laughter years ago when I was about 20.  I remember telling this joke to my parents.  I could hardly get it out for all my chuckling.  Once I told the joke, I noticed they were still staring at me - you know, like waiting for the punch line which I had already delivered.  When I pointed it out - that the punch line had past, they tried to recover, tried to join in with a forced laugh - lamely as I remember - and I am sure they were wondering had I slipped off my rocker.  So I am hoping better from you guys.  Here goes!What goes Hippity-Hop through the mud?Wait for it!The answer will slay you!Take your time!The answer?The Easter Pig!...Get it?  Easter, Easter bunnies, bunnies hop, pigs don't and mud ...... must be my delivery!  :-)"},
{"title": "K - is for Knitting and Me, A Love Story", "date": "Wednesday, April 13, 2011", "text": "Knitting is my passion - and it helped me come back to being me!(At this point I know half of my readers have clicked on to other blogs.Hope they come back for L.)Knitting and I came together in 1997.  There is a back-story.  There always is!At that time I was coming out of a high pressure management job, and I was very unhappy.  As part of my recovery from that experience I came recognize that I had created my unhappiness with my own actions.  My litany goes something like this:I loved the job (the responsibility, the people, the work, the challenge).I did nothing but the job (no hobbies, no fun, no time, no nothing).I lost perspective in the job (no boundaries, no limitations - job, job, and more job).I lost compassion and understanding in the job (My way or the highway!).I changed to someone unrecognizable in that job (b*tch, comes to mind).I didn't eat well or sleep well with the job (No time.  It was job, job and more job.)I burned out in the job (I resigned without another job lined up.)I survived the job (Because I quit - sometimes you just have to say \"uncle\" and move on).In the months after leaving that position, I had a great big void in my life to deal with. Yes, I was still working.  My employer liked me enough to offer me another position. (Go figure!  Guess they couldn't hear my self-talk!)  The new job was less stress, less prestigue and less money, but it was more structured, more predictable, and more do-able. But there was all this free time now - a huge void - a space to fill.  I think I forgot how to be me.  I had to figure that out.As part of \"figuring it out\", I began to read for pleasure again, exercise again, spend time with family again (yes, even family seem to fall off my radar) ... and explore a new hobby.  When I asked my husband about spending money on a class for learning to Knit - his response - \"Go for it.  It is cheaper than therapy.\"It was better than therapy too.The act of knitting has a bunch of advantages.It has a start, a middle and an end. I needed more of that in my life at that time.It produced a final product.  In the beginning my final products were pretty terrible.  :-)It had a mediative quality to it.  Knitting long stretches of the same stitch results in a lot of time for pondering other things and relax the mind.It was a thinking-person's hobby - complicated stitches and adjustments for fit can take a lot of focus and planning.Now 14 years later, my final projects are much better, my life is much fuller, and my downstairs closet is pretty full too (yarn stash - an addictive thing - come back when I do the letter Y.) I also own almost every knitting tool known to man.  So knitting is a worthy topic for the letter K.  The only topic really!! At least for me."},

You know the type.First in line.Annoyingly and wildly waves hand to volunteer.Jumps up and down saying, \"Pick me.

I guess I am a \"social animal\",  comfortable in groups, committees, crowds, conventions, mob scenes and massive intergalactic events! What is really bazaar is that I didn't marry a \"joiner\".  He likes solitary pursuits. Always has.  Doesn't enjoy large groups or crowds.  Finds them almost painful.  Appears quiet and withdrawn - almost antisocial.  But in truth, he just prefers smaller events.So what makes people be one type or another?  What attracts such different people to each other?  What makes such opposite personalities work together?Here's my take on this.  I couldn't be married to someone just like me if my life depended on it.  I would be exhausted by someone like me.  My head would explode.  And my husband?  I think he needs amusement in his life ... so he picked me!   :-)And about all those \"joiner\" qualities I have?  I am working to fix them.

{"title": "I - is for iPod, iPad, iGiveUp", "date": "Monday, April 11, 2011", "text": "Beware items that have a small \"i\" in front of the name like iPod, iPod Touch and iPad.Don't let this happen to you.All technology that starts with the small letter \"i\" it should be considered an addictive substance, Surgeon General's Warnings should be boldly displayed the labels along with the phone number of a local substance abuse hot line. Here is my story.  It all began simply enough at Christmas with a gift from my son - a small 1GB iPod called Nano.  Nano! Doesn't it sound like \"nana\" - an endearing nick name you might use with a trusted family member like your grandmother? Dear friends, do not be deceived.  My son introduced me to this life-sucking technology at Christmas time, a time of peace and tranquility, good will towards men and stuff like that. Needless to say, my guard was down!  Without a thought I opened the gaily wrapped gift box and stared at this item called Nano. And I thought, \"What am I going to do with this?\"  I think my face must have given me away.  He quickly came to my side and started to walk me through how to use it. I looked for an instruction booklet.  There wasn't one.  \"Where was the darn book?  How could anyone use such an alien piece of equipment without a book of instructions.  Boy, if this was a Microsoft product, they certainly would have included a detailed instruction book.\" And so on.  I didn't know that Apple products were so easy to use, that only the most die-hard Microsoft person would persist in seeking instructions - like me.And then he showed me how to connect the iPod to the computer to visit a place called iTunes.  (Notice, it is an \"i\" word!  Beware, beware.)  I watched patiently as he walked me through the process, all the time trying to maintain an interested and appreciative motherly look.  Mothers always love the things their children give them, right? And I wasn't going to fail the \"mother test.\"He showed me Music!  I had to admit that I didn't really listen to music. Who lies to their son. And it was Christmas. Who lies on Christmas?? He was not deturred.  He showed me audio books.  Well, maybe, I thought.  He showed me pod casts. \"What the heck are pod casts,\" I thought with the smile pasted on my face. I minored in Drama in college ...  acting.  You never know when you will need that skill. And I needed it now.  I was able to pull off sincere interest; it was Oscar worthy!! He continued to ramble on about pod casts.  He asked what I was interested in.  I said \"knitting\" thinking, \"Right, knitting pod casts - what are the chances!\"  He typed the word \"knitting\" in the Search Box.  The screen filled with knitting pod casts.  Free knitting pod casts! Actually pages of them. I pushed him out of the seat and took control of the computer mouse!  I looked more closely at the screen. Indeed, there were dozens of knitting pod casts and all of them free.  What happened after that is foggy, and could be described as an \"altered state\".And so now, years later, I have progressed from a small little Nano iPod, to a big iPod Classic and then to the iPod Touch which is a beefy version of an iPod with more functions like email and games.  You know... \"There's an App for that.\"  I became App crazed.  And because no one was stopping me (I probably could have used an Intervention by this point), I got an iPad last year when they were introduced.  And yes, I have 2 Apple lap top computers.  In my defense, but let me say this:  I TOTALLY love all my stuff that begins with \"i\".  Now that I think about it - \"i\" (small case) might be my most favorite letter of the alphabet!One last word of warning: Do not stand between me and my iPad.  It probably isn't safe.Signing off,iElaine (oh, I guess that is a bit over the top.)"},
{"title": "Thank you and an idea!", "date": "Sunday, April 10, 2011", "text": "First, let me say a sincere thank you to all who have visited my blog and decided to officially tag along with me now and then.  As a new blogger, it is a great thrill for me to open my blog, see a new name or face, know that they read something I wrote, comment, and plan on returning.  It puts a smile on my face.  Since starting this blogging journey I have consistently felt (and still feel) that I would blog even if I had no readers.  But readers are like icing on the cake.  I can eat cake and enjoy it, but I love the icing.  Thank you!And I had this idea:In my cruising through the A to Z April Challenge Blogs I found a lot really great blogs. Some were striking in their design, others told an ongoing story of their life, many were focused on writing and writing skills.  But on occasion, I would read an individual post that I thought was special.  When that happened, I couldn't help but wonder - how do we call attention to that one posting - how do I direct other readers to something I think they would enjoy.   I know the purpose of this blog event was to accept and complete a personal challenge - to post to your blog for 26 days using an alphabetic prompt.  But why not share individual discoveries with others?  Would spot-lighting a few posts at the end of the month be a detrimental to the heart of this challenge, or would it add enjoyment because you got a chance to see something you might have missed?  I believe the latter.So my May 1st posting will spotlight a few individual posts (probably 5) from other blogs that I want to share with you. I have a feeling picking just 5 will be pretty hard.  You may already be subscribed to the blog of the posting I spotlight - but if not, you might enjoy checking out a few posts that I thought were worth your time.And if you think this is a good idea, I would LOVE to see a few of your favorites on May 1st - postings I might have missed.  With over 1,000 blog participants we can't check in on everyone, but we can be pointed to those who seemed to shine on a certain day.Tomorrow?  Picking up the pace.  Eight postings down - 18 more to go!!  Think of it as mile 8 in a 26 mile marathon - we have a ways to go.  I am still excited about it!  Breathe, Breathe ..."},

{"title": "G - is for Ghosts", "date": "Friday, April 8, 2011", "text": "Ghosts!You wouldn't think that this topic would cause such pause.  But the belief or non-belief in ghosts seems to stir the most interesting conversations.Ghosts have been part of the human experience for a very long time.  Human history, art, folk lore and literature ... all are full of references to ghosts even as far back as ancient Greek theater.  I am not a scholar ... but there are probably older references as well.  With such a deep history, the subject of ghosts may make you pause.Despite that history, I don't believe in ghosts!  I have never seen a ghost or heard one or felt evidence of one.  There is nothing in my experience that would support that belief.  But there is a story that remains unexplained in my past, and I thought I would share it.Several years ago I worked in a local Spiritual Center.  This beautiful center was located in the middle of 300 acres of forest.  Quiet and peace.  It is what I think of when I remember my 3 years working there.  I loved every minute of it.One day while discussing a random topic, one of the sisters casually mentioned that the woman who held my position just prior to me reported that the grounds and buildings were haunted.  I immediately discounted it.  I don't believe in such things.  But I decided to pursue the conversation because this sister was a rational, common sense kind of person who I admire greatly.  She didn't say she believed it, but she wasn't laughing either.I wanted to know the reasons for this belief.  Apparently, this prior employee said that when taking pictures of the grounds and the buildings, she always got spots in the photo print that were it faded out a bit - subtly, but evident, as it marred the quality of the picture in one or two spots. And these spots were random, never in the same place and not present in pictures taken off the grounds.  These spots according to her were supposed to be the ghosts of the center and the grounds.I remember the conversation stopping at that point.  Actually, I think she kept talking, but my mind was racing. I also had been taking pictures of the center for some promotional materials.   I noticed the same thing happening with my camera and my pictures.  I was convinced my camera was failing and a new one was in my future. Then I would take the camera home and it functioned fine.  My pictures were perfect. I had never mentioned my photo problems to anyone.Later I looked at my pictures again privately.  I could still see the spots.  I could feel my brain struggling to explain this situation.  It didn't happen in all the pictures, just a few.  Something so episodic and faint, may not be noticed by other picture takers or discounted as I did.This Spiritual Center is a place of peace and tranquility.  Ghosts there?  I still have problems wrapping my brain around that concept.  My husband and I have visited the civil war battlegrounds of Gettysburg. That 3 day battle was such a slaughter of human lives - it is almost unbelievable in its scope.  Stories of haunted houses and grounds are so prevalent there, it is overwhelming.  Certainly if there were ghosts, Gettysburg would be a place where they would be - and not just one or two.  I've been a visitor there many times and never once experienced a ghost or questioned my belief.  But these pictures of the Spiritual Center, they made me wonder.  Unfortunately, I left all my pictures there years ago.  I don't even have one to share.  But I assure you, the pictures captured something I didn't see through the lens or in person.   It happened years apart, with 2 separate cameras and by 2 people who never met.  So what do you think?  Can you explain what my camera was capturing?  Do you believe in ghosts?  Have you had an experience that made you question your beliefs?After thinking about it for awhile I decided that I still don't believe in ghosts, but I still can't explain the pictures."},

We all have a narrow little view of the world through our own experiences ... experiences that are very much colored by our gender.  As I was considering this post, I couldn't help but wonder - if I could choose, would I choose male or female? When I am faced with a question of \"which is better\" - like toaster ovens, cars, vacations,  computers, etc., I like to revert back to a \"Pro vs Con\" list.  There is nothing on earth that can't be evaluated through the Pro vs Con list.  Growing up female is no exception.  So here we go ...Disclaimer - Disclaimer - DisclaimerThe following list is personal opinion, not meant to cause friction, insult a specific gender, start WW III.These are causal, off the cuff comments that popped into my brain. And no comments about my brain either!!  Pros of being femaleGives birth -  to grow a human being inside of you is probably the most wonderous experience in the world.  Men can't do that.Close female relationships - women usually form female groups - groups that are supportive and personally satisfying. Men usually seek out women for those kinds of groups.Women typically develop better coping and time management skills than men - mostly to survive so many conflicting demands of home and work. Men usually let their wives manage that!Ok, this one is silly, but .... women can wear men clothes.  Men can't wear women's clothes without a lot of raised eyebrows.Cons of being femaleGiving birth (yes, it is in this list too.)  To push that watermellon out of your body hurts like hell!  Men won't do that (I can't say I blame them.)Women aren't physically as strong.  Getting help to open that jar of pickles is more than making the man feel needed.  I want the pickles!!!Women usually get the lion's share of the work - family, household, professional. Yes, it makes them better time managers, but it also makes them sleep deprived and grumpy. This situation is improving as each generation raises their sons differently, but now ...Women are still looking into a \"glass ceiling\" and experiencing lower pay for the same work as men - at least that continues until the \"Great Revolt\" takes place.   :-)Seriously, all silly bullet points aside, one is not really better than the other - just different! It is our culture places labels and assigns values.But I am also glad ... I was born female.Your thoughts??"},

But after you hear the story, you will agree that my first name - Elaine - was born in a bar!My mother's side of the family had a naming tradition for the first daughters born in each generation.  Each girl took her mother's first name as a middle name.  It is just how it was done.And so ... my grandma's name was Leona. My mother's name was Elaine Leona. My name was to be Barbara Elaine.  Remember, it is just how it was done.  Mom went into labor and was put out for the birth (typical of the time). Then I was born.  Simple so far, right?Dad, being Dad ... being a new Dad ... decided to celebrate my birth by going to a local bar.  After all, mom was still unconscious, I wasn't much of a conversationalist at the time, and they didn't serve beer at the hospital.  No point in just hanging around.From here the details get fuzzy (beer was involved, remember?) but it might very well have gone something like this:_____Dad: (walking up to the bar with a big smile on his face and sitting beside another patron) Big day for me, Bartender.  I'll take a beer.Bartender: Comin' right up!!Patron:  (probably had a few already) biig daay, uhh?Dad: Right.

Not my thing, but let me know how it works out for you.\" But none can compare to the dogs in loyalty.  Dogs are loyal!  Beyond all measure!  More loyal than any other creature on the face of this earth.  Such loyalty is undeserved by humans - who frequently are loyal only when it serves their purposes.

Gosh .In the 8 months I have been blogging and following other blogs I have seen a number of Awards posted on various sites.  As a newbie blogger and a type A personality, I decided I was going to get me one!  You know, go to the Awards web site and just pluck one off the shelf.  And then I made a dismaying discovery that you can't just \"get one\", you have to be given one by someone else.  Despair!!  What were the chances of that happening?  Who could I bribe, who could bully?  Despair, despair.And then out of nowhere, Deirdra Eden Coppel, sent me an email, and said I was ... \"gulp\" ... inspiring!!  I am sure glad she didn't know to what lengths I was will to go to get one of these!!!But seriously, Deirdra, thank you.  I really do appreciate it and I will post it proudly!!Deirdra's blog can be found at: http://astorybookworld.blogspot.com/ .  Be sure to check it out.  Talk about Inspiring!

Thank You.\"Don't own so much clutter that you will be relieved to see your house catch fire.\"  Wendell Berry (Farming: a hand book)Clutter is a topic that holds a special place in my heart.  I am so fond of the topic of decluttering that I made it one of my goals of the next 20 years.  And you can find my September 2010 post on this topic here.That posting focused on environmental clutter - the stuff that fills your home, the things that were once important enough to buy, but not important enough to use.  Our family has made great strides in 2011 getting rid of stuff that fits that description.  We are far from done.But clutter comes in many forms.  Over the years I have struggled with the clutter of thoughts, ideas, concerns, worries, that sometimes bounce around in my brain - causing me distraction, stress and sometimes lack of sleep. I find myself \"crossing bridges\" before I get there.  The clutter that fills your mind can be much harder to manage and control.  After all, my brain can hold only so much before it starts randomly spilling stuff out of my ears.Over the years I have figured out a few ways to manage the mental clutter that sometimes over-flows and takes over.  To-Do lists - Yes, this isn't rocket science.  But to get stuff out of my brain and on paper works tremendously for me. Keeping track of where the paper is at any given moment? - More challenging with every year.  What I find remarkable about to-do lists is this ... sometimes I stuff them in a pocket of clothing, then that clothing gets put away for a season, the season then rolls around again, I pull out that clothing and at some point, I stick my hand in that pocket and find that old list.  And here is the remarkable part ... some stuff got addressed, some stuff didn't - and the world did not come to an end!  Keep paper and pencil beside the bed at night.  Nothing is more annoying that waking at 2:00 am with racing thoughts.  Write it down and go back to sleep.  All those nagging details will be there in the morning.Do less - Strip down your commitments so there is less to keep track of.  This one can be very hard, and I have done it several times.  I am sort of like the person who says \"I can stop smoking at any time.  I've done it many times before.\"  Drop commitments, recommit, drop them again, find new commitments, castigate one's self and drop them again, promising to never succumb to temptation.  (There is a problem here, and it is not clutter.  Check back with me again when we get to the letter \"J\" - and you will see what I mean.)Exercise - yes, really.  Exercise.  Something as simple as taking a walk settles the brain - even if it is only that you are too tired after exercising to fret about stuff.  I sincerely believe that our generations' issues are not more complicated than any previous generation.  We don't deal with it as well, because we are so sedentary. (maybe a generalization but a kernel of truth is there.)So how do you reduce the clutter of your brain?  I love to hear your coping skills.Oh, I just thought of another tip. This one might be the best one yet!!Ear plugs - to stop the spillage!"},

{"title": "B - is for Books that make your hands smile.", "date": "Saturday, April 2, 2011", "text": "\"Always read somethingthat will make you look good if  you die in the middle of it.\"  P. J. RourkeI can't say that I have always loved books.  In fact, while I was in school books held no special appeal ... as evidenced by my remarkably un-distinguished GPA.  I read to pass a test, to understand street signs, to determine the price of things and to check the TV Guide for my favorite show.  Owning books was also a pretty low priority.Somewhere along the way of growing, maturing, surviving ... I discovered BOOKS!!But books and I have a quirky history!  I think my experience with books covers the whole gamet of emotions.  At first I couldn't care less about books, and then ... the space ship hovered over me and I loved them (go figure).  But my love seemed to be limited to owning, not reading.  I wanted to \"own\" the knowledge inside the book.  My brain wasn't really engaged, just my hands, and owning the information was the goal ... next best thing to having it installed my brain. The logic on this is a bit faulty, I know, but it worked for a long time.Forty-two years ago, I married a man who also valued books.  He, however, actually read all his books - where I only read some of mine - remember, owning was better than reading.  Together we built a huge library. We haunted new and used book stores.  We bought book shelves to house those books.  We inventoried our books. And when we changed residences, we paid dearly for having so many (heavy) boxes of books to move. We made books a major part of our lives. And then 5 years ago, the serendipity that is life began to take my husband's vision.  Although he still retains some sight, the voracious reader and owner of books, sold off his entire library and replaced them with audio versions.  And I adapted with him.  Audio books were \"better\", so I thought.  You could  listen to books while cleaning, while cooking, while knitting, while walking. Now I have changed again ... I want to hold the book in my hand.  I want to feel the paper, admire the cover art, turn the pages and hold my place with a book mark. Holding audio books - tapes or disks, or even using the newest technology - the Kindle - just doesn't do it.My book ownership is modest - pretty much what I can hold in my small night stand.  I am pretty selective now in what I buy.  If it is fiction, I am happy to read it and pass it on to new hands.  The book doesn't live with me forever.  But more importantly, I want to actually read all my books.  Shocking, I know!!  :-)And finally ... I am happy to use my wonderful public library! How's that for a moment of quirky personal growth!My love-affair with books is back!"},
{"title": "A - is for Aging. Don't flinch!", "date": "Friday, April 1, 2011", "text": "I did see you flinch!Don't!Think on it.  If you weren't aging as you read this, you would be dead!! Aging is something to celebrate! Ok, ok, I won't keep this up all month - like Death and Destruction for D or Pestilence and Plague for P (although Pestilence ... maybe ...  has possibilities ...). Nope, I am sure I can't make case for those being cheery topics. But Aging - well here is my \"take\" on it.  FAQ'SMy answers!When do we start Aging?The moment we are conceived! True.  We start to age before we even are aware of our own existence ... certainly before we have the opportunity to buy face creams, purchase gym memberships or worry about our weight. Actually gaining weight during those pre-birth months is a good thing.  Don't you wish you could have enjoyed it? Why do we resist aging?This is an easy answer!  Our culture doesn't value aging.  You would need to be living in a paper bag to not know that!!  What is the most frustrating thing about aging?The body begins to slow down, fall short, and malfunction just about the time you become mentally and emotionally mature, knowledgeable, and professionally successful. The mind - now the mind can keep on going just fine!  Hence the phrase - \"the mind is willing but the body is not!\"  Doesn't that seem like a really bad joke by our Creator?  Do you think She chuckled to Herself when She created us and set this physical decline in motion?  I don't think She chuckled.  I think She laughed right out loud.Can we do anything about aging?Yes and No! No, you can't stop aging.  Remember, aging started before you took your first breath! Yes, you can age effectively, purposefully, and gracefully. But it takes work (more and more work as time goes by), and there is no magic pill or short cut (believe me, I have checked them ALL out). Volumes of \"how-to\" books have been written about how to age well.  But, really, it is pretty simple - it comes down to a few easy-to-remember points.Take care of the body and mind you were given.  You get only one.  Don't mess it up.Focus on the basics: keep your body and mind strong and active. Inactively is poison for both! (You will notice I didn't mention wrinkles, gray hair and skinny clothes. That is just the window dressing of aging - not the meat of the matter.)Don't assume that everyone over the age of 60 is mentally slipping! If you are lucky you will also reach 60 years of age! You will marvel at how young 60 feels when you get there. You will be shocked that anyone thinks 60 is \"old\".  You will feel strongly that 60 is just the beginning.  Don't box yourself in now with the label of \"mentally slipping\" when you turn 60 in the future.  You can be sure that someone will remember you said that.  (Actually I will remember.  I have an active list going now. You don't want to be on my list!)Rejoyce!!Aging is Great!! And if you don't think so, feel free to check out of living any time!The choice is yours!So since you are alive, aging, and reading this post, you should have some opinions!What are your answers to these FAQs?  PS - I do like Pestulence for P.  Maybe, just maybe .. come back later to see :-)"},
{"title": "Double It Up!!", "date": "Tuesday, March 29, 2011", "text": "Double knitting, that is. Wait!!  Non-knitters, do not click your mouse to move on just yet. You can stand to stick around long enough to see my pictures.  I promise I'll keep it short!:-)Today our knitting group participated in mini-workshop on Double Knitting.  Interested in learning this new technique for some time, it amazes me that I am only now just learning it.This an interesting knitting technique.  As knitters know, most stitches have a front side and a back side.  In Double Knitting, you are knitting the front and the back side at the same time and both sides look like they are the front!   And as noted in the picture, the pattern is reflected on the back side in reverse colors.  We were making potholders, and I chose the simple checker board pattern to start out. But this technique produces a double thick fabric so it is ideal for items like hats where warmth is important.  The technique takes alittle longer but it definitely holds your attention and it produces a very appealing product.There!  Short and sweet.  And even the non-knitters survived the experience."},
{"title": "A reflection on the future", "date": "Saturday, March 26, 2011", "text": "Do you ever take time to think about your future?  And for some of you, it might be your distant future.The future I am talking about doesn't have anything to do with what is on your 2011 calendar.  I don't mean your next 10 or 15 years, or your professional or educational future.   I am not even interested in knowing about your retirement expectations or financial security.What I am wondering is ... can you picture how you will actually live your life when you reach the grand old age of - say 85 or 90?  How do you see yourself at that point?  Will you be living independently or needing assistance?  How about managing your own finances, health care, social obligations or will you need help?  Do you have a thought of how to fill the many hours of each day? Will you be happy just sitting and being a \"watcher,\" or will happiness be achieved only through taking part, keeping connected, being involved?  Today I had a small glimpse into the lives of some very senior elderly who may have never given any thought to those questions.  Long ago they were focused on the day-to-day tasks of life, and pondering their distant future as a very old person may have been just \"too far over the horizon\" to think about or plan for.    Now living into their 90s they are sitting right in the middle of those questions that were avoided or just not considered.  It seems that the very elderly fall into two camps.  Some who reach the older senior years aren't much concerned about filling time. They seem happy to sit quietly with their own thoughts.  No need to read a book, talk to a friend, or watch a show. They are happy to sit for hours on end watching life happen around them without participating in it.  Others seem to draw energy from activity, walking the hallways, joining group activities, visiting with friends.  They are more likely to inquire, to ask questions, to express opinions.  Setting aside the issues of dementia and other mental diseases in the elderly, I suspect that neither group of older seniors thinks much about how they are living their daily lives now!  They are just following a pattern of life that they always followed.What is your pattern of living?  Is it a predictor of which group you fall into years from now?  Can you create the future you want by how you live now?  Or is the die cast by genetics and chemistry?As for me, I vote for making my own future.  I sure hope you get a choice!!"},

I visited the Tossing It Out blog, you know, just to see ...I was totally blown away by the number of those participating.  When I signed up I was #425.  The last blog on the list is now #625.  Very impressive and exciting.  And they are still accepting participants.As I mentioned in my first post about this challenge, I wanted to check out some of these interesting titles.  Each listed blog is also a link to that blog, so it was easy to quickly \"window shop\" through a number of them.  And there are some very talented writers out there.  I have visited a number of these web sites, but when you have over 600 to choose from it takes a bit of time.  :-)This time while visiting each site I wanted to select blogs that I would follow for this challenge.  I was hoping to select 5 to 10.  At the suggestion of the challenge organizers, I was focused on finding new blogs like mine - blogs with low follower counts. Such a wonderful and simple way to support new people. In my short experience in blogging, I discovered one big advantage of following new folks.  If they have a low follower count,  you are better able to develop a blog relationship with them.  Some of my best \"blogger conversations\" have occurred with folks who have 50 followers or less.I am very much looking forward to April 1st.  Let the fun begin!!"},
{"title": "Normal day mostly!", "date": "Wednesday, March 23, 2011", "text": "Today was a fairly normal day.  I don't think I have had a \"normal day\" in quite some time.  I guess that technically makes it an \"abnormal day\" - different from my regular days!  :-)I hung around the house after breakfast in my PJs doing ... god knows what, until I had a bit of a panic attack when I realized it was already 10:45 am!!  Holy Cow!    I had to get to Curves, and get in my walk and then get my grand-dogs!  And maybe a few other things, but no biggy.  An off day for sure, but if I didn't get my butt in gear, I wouldn't get those simple things done.So I headed for Curves.  The competitive part of my nature hit those machines HARD!  I wasn't going to be happy with any yellow bumps on my computer lady this time.  I pushed, and pushed and pushed.  When I finished (sweating buckets), I put my key tab into the computer kiosk - and everything came up Green!!  I was really pleased.  As long as I don't kill myself competing with myself, I should be fabulous by summer!  Well, at least more fit!I added my usual walk to the end of my Curves workout.  It was an opportunity to walk in a new place - well, sort of new.  I never walk around Town Center.  I discovered that Lake Kidamukundi, the lake in Town Center, was undergoing dredging.  All the lakes in our city need dredging, and I guess it was this lake's turn.  As you can see from the pictures, the day was overcast, the shrubbery was still wearing its winter face, the wild life had moved on to less noisy places, and heavy equipment was the center piece of this lovely man-made lake.  Kind of sad, but important for the health of this lake.This picture shows one area of lake front with sculptures of James Rouse, developer of Columbia with his brother.  Behind me are a number of restaurants and behind those restaurants is The Columbia Mall.Here is another view of the same area.  The large white building used to be the headquarters of the Rouse Company that managed the city for many years.  My husband used to work there.  I walked for about 40 minutes taking whatever path curiosity directed. Walking behind some buildings I suddenly came upon a large bunch of snow!  It as been weeks since I have seen any snow around our community.  I guess this slowly melting mound of snow was as tall as the parking garage at one time, snow from the surrounding parking lots - and it finally has melted to this.  Amazing.  We have had weather in the 60 and 70s for days.  To still have this snow was a surprise. Then it was off to get my son's dogs for the day.  Our new \"regular\" weekly dog schedule is now Tuesdays and Wednesdays for Meathead and Grimace.  Thursdays and Fridays for Milo.  And the weekend is pretty much everyone. As write, my son's two boys are sleeping and snoring beside me on the couch.  It is such a comforting sound.  Everyone's been fed, and walked, and done their business and now it is time to nap beside Grandma.  I love my peaceful dog days."},
{"title": "Lunch with Happy One!", "date": "Monday, March 21, 2011", "text": "Lunch with Happy One at Ram's Head Restaurant!She got me blogging, weaving and walking.  She also happens to be a good friend and part of my knitting group.We laughed alot.I am very lucky to have such a good friend.Check out her blog!You've heard of Godzilla! Well, his cousin is Carb-zilla.  I like an after-dinner Carb-zilla.If you have been following my recent postings, you may be aware that I am trying to eat healthier - to help manage my slightly elevated blood sugar.  It has been an interesting journey.To begin with - I am not a big fan of artificially manipulating my diet.  In the past, it has always failed to bring permanent results.  That is because all \"diets\" are doomed to fail unless you make a \"life style\" change.  Life style changes are pretty hard to do - not impossible, but generally more work than most people want to put into it.Anyway, I have a valid reason for making this change, beyond how I look in a mirror - who the heck wants diabetes down the road.  If you know ANYTHING about diabetes, you know you don't want to have that problem if you can avoid it. So I have been doing things like reducing bad carbs, eating good carbs but fewer, increasing vegetables, choosing lean meats and increasing my exercise. And other than a few setbacks (like today I just had to have chocolate chips with my peanut snack - I think my blood sugar dropped) ... I have had some success. But it is clear that this process of adjusting my food intake will take some time to achieve.  If it were a real \"diet\", I would throw up my hands and say I failed with the chocolate chips.  But it is a process and hopefully a life style change that will be made over time.  That is the plan, at least.Breakfast and lunch seem to go smoothly. I have become a big fan of wraps.  I am eating more protein and veggies, and less carbs at these meals - so I am snacking less as a result.  All good (except for today with those darn chocolate chips). Dinner is still a mixed bag of issues.  Part of the problem is I am fixing a meal for others - not just myself.  So it isn't as carb neutral as I would like.  Still working out those details.  And I like my glass of red wine while cooking. It is a big fat carb, but it is my reward for cooking.  I wish cooking was a reward unto itself, but it isn't for me.  Even the book I was reading about Pre-Diabetes didn't totally ding a glass of red wine a day.  Of course, the big zinger is after dinner.  I really like to have something sweet to finish off the meal.  Instead of have a traditional dessert or the recommended fruit - I have been having a mini York Peppermint Patty.  It gives me an intense sweet after dinner dessert - that is small, not a bunch of carbs or calories, but definitely sugar - a low fat sugar.   I guess my need for a Carb-zilla - after dinner is pretty strong. What I find interesting is a single mini York Peppermint Patty seems to do the trick, but a 1/2 cup of ice cream - doesn't.  I want more.  Anyway, so far this trick works.The up side so far - is that I am not counting calories or carbs ... a process that is a total downer for me because my brain than demands more once I start micro-managing my diet on that level.Hoping this mix of diet changes with increased exercise does the trick.  Blood tests will tell the truth in June."},

{"title": "First Day: I have many green bumps.", "date": "Saturday, March 19, 2011", "text": "My first day using Curves Smart and I am a happy person!Since starting this program I have been mostly orienting to a different Columbia center, the new staff and the new equipment.  I needed to figure out their schedules ( Zumba classes are held at various times so the equipment is not available.)The staff at this center are really more interested in helping you to use the equipment correctly - that is different from my last experience.This center had 3 new pieces of equipment to me. And the Curves Smart technology takes some getting used to.So today was my day to get onto Curves Smart.  Each person is issued a Curves Smart ID tag.  Before using the equipment, your tag is entered into the Tag Reader at the kiosk.  Information about you and your previous workouts are downloaded to your tag.  The tag is then inserted into each piece of equipment you use.  After finishing your workout, the tag is returned to the Tag Reader at the kiosk - information is uploaded and you can review your results.  Pretty nice set up.A staff member moved around the circuit with me to insure I used the equipment correctly and I understood the Curves Smart feedback at each machine.  She kept reminding me that since this was my first time, I shouldn't be too alarmed when I uploaded the information.  New people always have a lot of \"yellow flags\" ... areas of improvement highlighted with yellow marks on the electronic female figure displayed at the kiosk.  Green flags or dots on the female figure mean you are doing fine that area of the body.  Yellow flags or dots mean you need to work harder on certain areas of the body when you get to the appropriate equipment.  She must have reminded me 3 times not to be discouraged while I was working out!! The thought crossed my mind - guess I look pretty weak! She is trying to set expectations low. My expectations were pretty low, but still ...So I get to the kiosk after my work out and insert my tag ... waiting for the feedback.  All the time wondering, \"Man... I worked hard, this kiosk better not tell me I am a weeny!\"  And then the information filled the screen.  I had no idea what I was looking at, of course.   The staff member was looking over my shoulder and she commented enthusiastically - \"Wow, you did great!!  Usually new people have a screen full of yellow.\"  I had about about 60 to 70% green and the rest yellow.  I started to feel better about having worked my butt off!! Not so bad for someone is almost 64!After 10 work out sessions, the system will make an evaluation of my program, and if I have gotten stronger, put more resistance into the equipment.  Then I will probably go back to more yellow flags until I can get stronger and make them all green again ... and then the resistance is bumped up again ... and so on ... until I look like Arnold Schwarzeneggar. OK - so maybe that is an exaggeration, but it did pop into my brain!While I was changing my shoes and getting ready to leave - the Zumba class was gathering.  While I packed up I watched the class for about 10 minutes.  Zumba is available to all members for a small extra charge of $2 or $10 for non-members.  As I watched I was very impressed by the level of energy, movement, jumping around, and overall effort required to do this.  These folks were really working hard!! Great cardio work out. It looked like they were having a blast!  As I was beginning to leave the Zumba instructor called out something like: \"Great job everyone, now we have our muscles all loosened up.\"  I stopped dead and said (out loud, apparently loud enough to be heard over the music!!): \"What!! That was just the warm up???\"  The comment brought \"the house down\" so to speak!  Everyone was laughing including me.  So the lesson I learned today is this - although I had 60-70% green bumps on my computer lady's butt and other areas, and I was feeling pretty full of myself on the simplest level of difficulty - my exaggerated opinion of myself was filled with \"yellow flags\" as I realized how far I was from doing Zumba. There is always tomorrow!!  :-)"},
{"title": "Preparing, preparing - working, working", "date": "Friday, March 18, 2011", "text": "I know I have been absent almost a week.  But not idle.The Blogging A to Z Challenge - the prep work for the April 2011 Challenge is taking some time.  I have been picking topics, snapping pictures, writing posts all in preparation for April 1st.  It didn't seem like such a big deal when I signed up, but now I see that this challenge could be pretty difficult to sustain.  There are no negative consequences to missing posts or not keeping up, and it is a challenge for sure.  Haven't even started and I am feeling the pressure.My walks continue to be great, but alittle shorter than normal in the last week.  I think they are shorter because I started Curves last week.  I made some interesting discoveries about myself:I wasn't sore from the first sessions. That is good.I wasn't as tired leaving the gym as I anticipated.  I did feel that I had worked pretty hard.  That is good.I do seem to run out of steam during my walks around the 30 minute mark.  That is not so good. I think I have just run out of available energy.  Need to improve.My energy levels overall have picked up noticeably from January.  That is good.The flexibility of going to Curves on my schedule rather than on a class schedule is a big improvement.  I have worked harder this week in total than in previous weeks.  That is very good.The best news is that the Curves program has greatly improved over my experience from 2 years ago.  The new program is called Curves Smart.  Curves equipment now is electronically tailored to you and your progress. As you improve, it senses these improvements and puts more resistance in the machines - upping your effort.  This is great news.  When I used Curves several years ago, as you improved, you seemed to work less - so to improve your effort you needed to increase your repetitions or go around the circuit more times.  Now that is not necessary.  And at the end of each work out you can see your progress on a computer terminal.  It is a very positive improvement.So things are looking up - I haven't blogged much, but progress is being made."},

There are so many wonderful blogs out there and so many creative people.Recently I discovered a different kind of blog event - a Blog Challenge calledA to ZBlogging ChallengeApril 2011.  It is hosted by a number of bloggers.  The site I visited was Arlee Bird's - Tossing It Out.  Briefly, bloggers are challenged to blog every day in April except for Sundays.  Each posting should feature a letter of the alphabet (ie - April 1 would be the letter A, April 2 would be the letter B - and so on.)  26 letters and 26 days.  One example of a blog post for April 1st was - blogging about April Fool's Day.  Cute.   I would imagine that some letters - like U, X, Z - would stretch the imagination.  I am already curious about what topics others might write about when those letters crop up.I could feel my mind already assigning topics to various letters.  I was intrigued by the idea and signed up.  I blog most days but the inspiration to theme my posts to the letters of the alphabet was too much to resist.  By clicking on the blog link above or clicking on the green box below - you will be connect to the sign up web site - Tossing It Out.  There you will find more details.This should be a bunch of fun as well as a challenge.Note: This is a pretty sizable event.  I was participant 428!  I would like to think I could visit each site each day, but that would be impossible.  But what I do like is that there appear to be a large number of interesting blogs out there to check out - some very interesting titles. I am eager to explore a number of them.  And the possibility of growing your readership at your own blog - makes this something to look forward to."},

Happy Birthday!!!The goal of this blogfest?  Create a Bucket List!  I couldn't resist. Of course, the instructions said to limit your list to 5, and AGAIN, I couldn't follow instructions.  I needed to do 10. Do you think I have problems with authority?So here goes!!Visit England, Ireland and Canada before airport security reaches critical absurdity - literally stripping you down to \"birthday suit\" in public.Walk 6 to 7 miles per day like my friend Happy One - of course, it took her 25 years to do that - not sure I have another 25 years in me before I kick the bucket (oh sorry, I really need to find a way to resist that).      :-)How about live another 25 years - oh, heck - let's make it 37 years so that I can see my 100th birthday (this is a Bucket List - I can add anything I want!  Right?).  Have enough money to live to be 100! (a seriously important point - I don't want to choose between buying yarn and eating.)Take a train ride across country - from the east coast of the US to the west coast - have a luxury sleeping car, great food, a comfortable chair in front of a big picture window and my knitting. Stop a National Parks.  Stop at yarn shops.Take a Cruise - have a state room with a private sun deck.  Knit.Sit on the porch at my cousins' mountain: knit, sip wine, walk the garden, play with their fiber toys, hike to the top of their mountain.  Commune with the bears (I hear they have them.) Well, maybe not ... maybe commune only with pictures of bears.  A week would do me!!  I also hear they don't have many stink bugs up there - a BIG plus.Spend a week at the beach by myself. Scrap that!  Make it a month. Knit.Get a part time job in a bookstore or a yarn store AND not go bankrupt.See a Tornado and not on TV either, at a safe distance, yet close enough to really see it but no so close that it takes away my yarn stash."},
{"title": "Back Again - to Curves!", "date": "Thursday, March 10, 2011", "text": "OK, so I returned to Curves yesterday.Curves is a gym designed for women.  The Curves program includes all five components of exercise - warm up and cool down, cardio, strength training and stretching -- and works every major muscle group while helping to keep you in your heart rate in the training zone.I belonged to this gym several years ago and found it very effective. You can get a full body work out in 30 minutes.  The gym has long hours, is open 6 days a week and can be used on your own schedule.  I think this change will fit my fickled personal schedule better than attending a class with a fixed time.My goal of staying active remains a high priority.  Progress walking is moving forward well, but it isn't improving my strength.  And although I found Tai Chi to be beneficial to my balance and leg strength, getting to a 4:00 Wednesday fixed class time seems to be doomed lately.  I have missed more and more Tai Chi sessions this winter due to conflicting demands and schedules. And once it is missed, it can't be made up at another time.  Unfortunately - after 2 years of practice, Tai Chi has taken a back seat to so many other things that just happen to fall at the same time. So I will replace Tai Chi with Curves. Yes, I have a crazy schedule at times, and yes, there are priorities that do bump my personal life with increasing frequency, but if an exercise option is flexible enough, it can fit into anyone's schedule - if you make it so!Welcome back to my life - Curves!"},

And if you are lucky enough to have your camera with you (I was ... ), you can capture some of the inspiring projects that just seem to hatch from no where like spring flowers. Yesterday was one of those days.Some create for friends - this lovely weave-it blanket is going to be a surprise for a friend (lucky friend!). It is half finished.  Happy One has created many of these lovely blankets. Some create for charity - for the littlest of heads and quilt squares for a support of the military.                      Some create for loved children.And some, like me, try to knit when they are at these meetings, but mostly talk and visit! :-) I actually did alot of that this meeting. One of my current projects are a pair green socks that I am knitting for me.  They aren't far enough along to take a picture.  I think I knit 4 rows, made a mistake, tinked a row ( tink is knit spelled backwards - un-knitting), and reknit the row - 5 rows total in 2 1/2 hours of the meeting.  At this rate I should have these socks complete in ... oh, maybe 2015?  :-)  I am also hand-weaving a shawl for mom.  I am making decent progress on that project.  Pictures?  Soon, very soon!Regardless of how long or short it takes, each project is created with skilled and loving hands."},

But during my recent walks I have seen mini signs of spring. Some areas of grass are really greening up. And the green tips of spring flowers are pushing up through the ugly ground.It sort of becomes a game to see if you can find the changes.Can you see it?Look again.  Now do you see it?No, it is not the piece of trash - although that is also a sign that people are out and about more now that the weather is warming up. But a sign of spring?

{"title": "You are just perfect!", "date": "Monday, March 7, 2011", "text": "This mirror spoke to me.  I found it hanging in the doggie day care lobby and had to take a picture of it.Think about it!  If people would focus on the good in themselves, their positives over their negatives, look at life through a mirror like this one ... they would be happier.So much unhappiness is based on poor self esteem.  In a effort to boost their own feelings about themselves, they find fault and are critical of others, they focus on the negatives in life, and they define friendships by how much they are the same rather than celebrating the differences. How sad.  I sometimes stuggle with these feelings myself, especially if I have been the receiptent of a careless or thoughless comment, or an unfair and hurtful conversation.  But when I saw this mirror, the simple statement seemed to resonate - a reminder that I have much to offer and much to be happy about.The blog posting from Happy One yesterday seemed to \"mirror\" (sorry, I couldn't help myself), my posting today.  Below is a partial quote I stole from her blog.  Check out the full quote at Happy One's blog  here.\"Happiness and joy do not come from the outside but from within you.They are the result of a conscious decision,a deliberate choice,one we make each day.\"Joyce Meyer"},
{"title": "Zombies round out the dinner!", "date": "Sunday, March 6, 2011", "text": "We don't get out of the house socially as a couple all that often any more.  Just the nature of full time caregiving.  But that doesn't mean we are hermits.This weekend we had dinner and a game night for 8 people at our house.  I served Beef and Chicken Kabobs.  I always think of this dinner as quick to put together - but it isn't quick at all.  There is a lot of prep work (chopping, marinating, mixing, loading the items onto the kabob sticks).  But they cook under the broiler and that is fast, so it gets to the table quickly once the cooking starts. My son's girl friend brought a yummy tossed salad with big shavings of cheese and strawberries on the side.  And our friends brought a tasty pound cake with ice cream.  Check out the top of the cake.  Very elegant.But the highlight of the evening was the game playing.  My husband is a bit of a game collector. We selected a game called Lord of the Fries - a Steve Jackson Game.The rules began this way:Welcome to Friedey's, the Fast Food Restaurant of the Damned.  Our staff will serve you to the best of their ability ... but they are all brainless zombies. Some of the \"meals\" listed in the game were:Beef which is Actually BeefTequila MockingbirdIntestinal FortitudeMao Tse TongueNeato FajitoSecret Tijuana DeathmatchMeals with those names made my Kabobs sounded pretty tame!It was a great game for a large group and the playing time is 30-60 minutes. The rules are easy to absorb - even after a glass of wine and the game play can be fast and furious.  We had a great time."},
{"title": "Milo Intimidates a Rotweiller", "date": "Saturday, March 5, 2011", "text": "Yesterday was Milo's first visit to Coventry Doggie Day Care.  This Columbia facility is open 7 days a week for day care, boarding, training and grooming.  Today Milo was evaluated for suitability to enroll in doggie day care. And, of course, his grandmother went with him just be sure that they were TOTALLY aware of all Milo's wonderful qualities, intelligence, and good looks.  I also wanted them to know that Milo had strong extended family ties, a magnificent pedigree and a great wardrobe.So we put on Milo's best sweater - the one his grandmother knitted for him and off we went. But first he needed to \"stop and smell the flowers\" and \"water\" them before getting in the car with his mom.After talking with the owner of the center,  the exam started.  She looked at his teeth and did a brief physical exam.  He passed!Then Milo went with the owner into the open play area to see how he adjusted to a strange environment, other dogs and being crated. Dogs are divided into basic groupings: puppies, adults, seniors and special needs.  Three puppies were selected to meet Milo with each puppy entering one at a time until all 3 dogs were interacting with him.  It appears he failed that little test, because he was playing too rough.   Too much in charge!  Too Alpha!  Too Milo!  What is remarkable is that these 3 puppies were all bigger than him.  In fact, one of the puppies we a Rotweiller puppy that was 3 times Milo size.  Never let it be said that \"attitude\" can't carry the day.  So 3 adult dogs were selected and the test continued to see just which group Milo did best with.  The adult dogs held their own with Milo (who has a pretty large impression of himself - in the mirror he sees a Great Dane.)  And so he passed that test - he will be grouped with the adult dogs.My daughter and I were watching this series of tests through a glass door (unable to participate in any way, offer encouragements or advice - damn).  Like a nervous parent and grandparent, we watched Milo interact with 6 dogs total, hoping he was doing the right things, not being tooo overbearing, but wanting him to handle the situations well.  The center owner had her own check list - checking off various observations while we watch anxiously.  And at no time did the facility owner ask about his pedigree or his wardrobe!  :-)  *sigh*Other than the omission on the wardrobe question,  I was very impressed with this woman's ability to \"read\" the body language of the dogs as they interacted with each other.  Her approach is based mostly on ignoring undesirable behavior and rewarding acceptable behavior.  She used her own body language - rather than her voice - to communicate with the dogs.  And her desire to pick the right group for Milo  - for his benefit as well as the benefit of the other dogs was very assuring.  Her actions and comments spoke of confidence and experience.  Milo's first daycare session is schedule for a 1/2 day one week from today - a Saturday.  If today is any indication of how this will go (he has been soundly asleep since we returned several hours ago - after only one hour at day care),  a 1/2 day of doggie day care should make him unconscious for a full 48 hours!! Hopefully he will learn to pace himself."},

You can check out the responses of others by clicking on the link above.Well when I saw that topic ... some favorites of mine just popped right into my mind.  I didn't have to think very hard about it.  And it may be a symptom of just how bad current TV is now a-days!Anyway ...  I was surprised to find how hard it was to limit my choices to just 5.  Well here they are!!Buffy, the Vampire Slayer - I sure do miss Spike and Angel. I loved the simplicity of good vs evil in that show. I loved that the good guys could have an evil side - but still look smashingly handsome while drinking blood.  I really miss Angel. (Oh, I already said that).Angel - Thank God David (aka Angel) is still doing TV in the series Bones.  Easy on the eyes - that man!  Yeah that the Buffy characters sometimes made appearances on that show.  Grey's Anatomy - OK, real medicine is not filled with quite this much drama - but it is way fun to see just how bazaar the writers can get.As Time Goes By - I love English shows and this one is my favorite.Night Court - A laugh a minute.I know only 5 were asked for but I just have to add a few runners' up (sorry, I am just not much of a rule follower.)Star TrekWest WingMonkNight StalkerSo what are your favorite TV shows that have gone off the air?  All I can say is Thank God for Netflix."},

It was a month marked by big, big improvements for me - but I am very glad to see it gone!February was a hugh de-clutter month. Need to do more - as much as we got rid of - there is hardly a dent.February was a hugh improvement in my walking. I went from walking 14 miles total in January to 31 miles total in February.  Most of that was done to get rid of my mentally down state - but whatever the impetus, the jump in miles was big.  And the jump in my energy levels because of the walking was also big.February marked my mom's 85th birthday - and marked her return to normal health (normal for her, at least).February was a hugh weather improvement month over last February.  Anyone in the mid-atlantic region of the US would agree with that.  Last February we counted our snow totals in feet.  This February ... inches!February produced the most knitting and weaving I have done in almost 12 months.  Granted, I had to keep focused, but it gave me the small positive feedback that I needed periodically.And finally ... February marked the start of my digging out from my mental funk, my adjustment to loss ... I have a long way to go, but big improvements.

{"title": "Join the Bucket List Blogfest at MoWrites", "date": "Wednesday, February 23, 2011", "text": "A fellow blogger - and my son's girlfriend, is sponsoring a Bucket List Blogfest on her blog in honor of her March birthday.  I have joined up and I want to encourage you to join as well.Whenever I think of a \"bucket list\" I think of life activities or goals that are outside the normal scope of your everyday life.  They are activities that might be small or enormous in scope, easy or hard to achieve, if money, time and life responsibilities were no barrier - you would do these activities before you kicked the bucket!!  Since I am closer to kicking the bucket than my dear Mo, I think my list will be shorter.  :-)I think it would be fun to create such a list and see if any of the activities could be achieved.  But even more fun would be to read the bucket lists of others.  There could be a WOW factor - open up avenues you never dreamed of ... \"What a great idea.  I would like to do that too!!!\"So please join us in kicking the bucket ... aaa, wrong. Please join us in the Bucket List Blogfest.  Yes, that is better.  See you there.No, I am not dieting!I hate the word \"diet\" (a 4 letter word as it turns out).  That poor little word \"diet\" is so strongly related to the goal of weight loss that I can hardly separate its real meaning from the implied understanding everyone has when it is said out loud.  And I have already expounded in my Soap Box about dieting so I will spare you that rant now. But I find myself needing to change my mix of foods for valid medical reasons and I am hoping that blogging about this journey will help me stay focused on this goal.Recently I heard the diagnosis \"prediabetic\" used in relation to me!  ME!  Those who follow my blog will remember that I declared myself as \"fine\"!  And my doctor confirmed that I am fine as well.  And my blood work declared that I am just fine - except for one tiny little number - that stupid blood sugar number. That little number called \"glucose\" just had to pop its little head up over the normal range by a few points!!  It couldn't be \"just fine\" like all the rest of the numbers on the page!  No.  It had to call attention to itself.  So my doctor called and left the message to \"change my diet\" - that stupid four letter word again! Hey, Mr. Doctor, how about saying ... \"change the mix of foods\" ... or something!!OK - \"change my diet\"!  I had to figure out exactly what that meant!  I understand \"low fat\" and \"low calorie\" - but now do I have to figure out what \"low sugar\" means as well?  (Insert light bulb going on inside of head ... here)Buy a book!!!  Yes, find a book that will explain exactly what kind of food someone can eat or not when they are prediabetic!!!  I just love books.  And I just love Amazon.  And wouldn't you know Amazon had a book on prediabetes.  Stop Prediabestes Now by Jack Challem and Ron Hunninghake, M.D.  Actually they had quite a few titles because prediabetes is considered almost an epidemic condition these days. Hey, wait a minute!!  Maybe that is how I got this ... I caught it from someone!!!  ... Ok, back to reality.  I didn't catch it.  I think I may have created it.  But wouldn't it be nice if I could just blame this on someone else. Oh, well.  Back to boring rational thought.So I am getting educated.  So far it sounds like avoiding bad carbs or too many carbs, eating more vegetables, fiber and lean proteins, exercising more and small weight loss is the key. Boy ... doesn't that just sound like every weight loss program you ever heard of in your whole life? Aren't there any new ideas out there!!!  :-)So we shall see.  My body has ambushed my efforts before when I tried to eliminate a particular food item from my \"mix of foods\".   I am hoping this book gives me some insight on how to play that mind game.  In reality, I have a valid medical reason to make these changes - rather than just wanting to wear \"skinny  clothes\" - not a reason that \"carries any weight\" with me!!:-)"},
{"title": "Damp and Delightful Monday", "date": "Monday, February 21, 2011", "text": "Walking today turned out to be delightful.When I left the house it was very overcast!  The temperature was in the 40s.  Not a bad combination for a walk, but I got no more than 10 minute out when it began to rain gently - more of a heavy mist.  I considered turning back and getting on the treadmill, but the treadmill is not as much fun and I was already wet.  So I motored on.  I am very glad I did.   I headed for my shopping center.  I decided to walk under the overhang of the stores and around my Harris Teeter.  I haven't \"walked\" my Harris Teeter since last summer.  This past summer I took a picture of the Grocery isle.  This is the Pharmacy isle.  I know you have all been waiting a long time to see this picture.  If you are really good readers - and comment a bunch - next time I will show you the Produce section.  :-)Anyway, once inside the store I was sure I looked like a drowned rat. My coat was soaked on the outside and my hair (no hat) was plastered to my head.  By the time I made a few swings around the store and the center, the rain had stopped.  So I headed back home.  It was a very different walk and longer than anything I had done this year - 57 minutes and 7496 steps. I usually walk 40-45 minutes and go 5,000 to 6,000 steps.  By the time I walked back in the house I felt GREAT!! (and wet!)As I suspected, my walking mojo is returning again and it is making a big difference in how I deal with my life.  Just delightful.Hope your Monday is the same."},
{"title": "Dungeons and Dragons Day", "date": "Saturday, February 19, 2011", "text": "Saturday was a game day with friends.  We meet with this particular group every month and it is a very long standing relationship of about 30+ years.  We call it D&D for Dungeons and Dragons, because that is how it all began.  When the role playing game Dungeons and Dragons came out, this group was formed.  But it has evolved into a role playing game built on rules of various games.  And the creative adventures are developed by my imaginative husband.  In the picture is my character sheet and my dice as well as the current fiber project I work on during the game.  My son has been part of this game since he was 7.  His girl friend plays too - and, of course, his dogs come.  Meaty is pretty much bored by our game, and at one point while he was sitting by my sliding glass window, he rested his chin on the glass and began to snore.  Too bad I can't put sound effects in this blog.  It was too funny.When he isn't sleeping propped up against the glass in the kitchen, he is sleeping on Milo's butt - the only thing Milo is good for (from Meathead's perspective) is a pillow.  :-)It is also interesting to see in the picture how much Milo has grown.  He is now 31.5 pounds of pure muscle.  The standard for his breed - the top weight - is 28 pounds.  And let me tell you, when he is pulling on his leash, he can knock you down if you aren't being careful.That night my daughter and I had 3 dogs overnight.  The 5 of us slept crunched together on the pull out couch in the livingroom.  We call these evenings \"sleep overs\" but that is a misnomer.  Not much \"actual sleep\" occurs.  Milo is very vigilant when sleeping with my daughter so any movement by the other 2 dogs, usually causes a bit of dog-swearing by Milo with growling and nipping.  And then that night - the cats who didn't want to be outdone, knocked a folding chair down the basement steps.  Milo and I both jumped out of bed for that.  I knew immediately what it was, but I just wanted to be sure no cat was laying injured at the bottom of the stairs.It was a \"fun\" Saturday."},
{"title": "Walking, heat wave, and stink bugs", "date": "Friday, February 18, 2011", "text": "Walking continues ... better this month than last.  The sky was most amusing.  While I was walking I looked over my left shoulder and saw this angry dark sky. And over my right shoulder was this beautiful blue sky with puffy white clouds.  Go figure.  Mother Nature isn't sure exactly what she wants to do.Increasing total monthly mileage ... that is what I have decided to focus on this year.  At least that is what I plan to do right now.  Check back in 15 minutes and I will probably have changed my mind. :-) The February weather has been pretty fabulous - actually compared to February 2010 - it is a heat wave today.  In fact, I was totally overdressed on my walk for the 73 degrees it is right now.  Wearing jeans, a long sleeve polo shirt, and wool socks, I was sweating bullets by the time I returned home.  Others were more appropriately dressed: shorts, short sleeve shirts and sun hats.  For February 18th, it felt like a May day.  But the walking was good and I have now changed into my summer clothes (it is February 18th for gosh sakes!!) and I have a large glass of ice water by my side.  Life is good.And, of course, with the warm weather came the first stink bug. I am typing here in the living room, and I can hear Milo snorting around in the kitchen.  A quick check revealed that Milo had hunted down a stink bug and was terrorizing it.  Those pesky bugs are probably hatching in the millions outside right now, but this one found its way into my house and it is now floating in the toilette.  But the TV news reports say that this should be a bad year in this area for stink bugs - \"of biblical proportions\" - I believe they said.  And since they have no natural enemies here it probably will be very bad indeed.But no sense borrowing trouble.  The weather today was letter perfect, my windows are open and the walk was great ... and one wayward stink bug does not an infestation make!  (Not yet, anyway.)Enjoy your day!What a wonderful, wonderful book!! The Help raised so many emotions and memories for me.Kathryn Stockett's bestseller shares the experiences living in a small Mississippi town and the wide racial divides between black women who served as maids to white women during the turbulent 60s.   Centered on two black maids, Aibileen and Minnie, and one white young woman named Skeeter, this novel tells how these 3 women who join forces to write a book about \"the help\", the good and the bad experiences of the black maids in service to white families.  The novel reveals several powerful elements:  the disgraceful state of race relations in the deep south, the seeds of attitudinal change, and the power of the written word. Told from the perspective of these 3 women, it gives us a painful glance into our not so distant history, and the illogical and degrading practices of segregation. One major theme demonstrates the crazy logic of the time.  White southern women were more than willing to turn the care and raising of their children over to black maids, but these same maids were not allowed to use the \"white\" toilette facilities in the home.  From the vantage point of 50 years in the future, you find yourself forcefully pulled into the story and cheering for each little step forward towards basic human understanding. This understanding is eloquently stated by Skeeter as she reflects on her friendship with the maid, Aibileen, near the end of the novel, \"We are just two people.  Not much separates us.  Not nearly as much as I'd thought.\"During the 60s I was old enough to remember the massive cultural changes that were evolving in our country.  But my own experience were not very diverse.  In Maryland, I lived in a white neighborhoods, my friends were white and my classrooms were filled with primarily white students. I have no recollection of parental bias with regards to race.  They probably had opinions being raised by families with the typical prejudices of the time, and it was never discussed.  It wasn't that the topic was avoided, it just never came up.  My opinions about race were formed primarily from my experiences as an adult. And it began most strikingly with the death of my father in 1970.My father supervised a bottling plant production floor, and some of his workers were African American day-laborers who he recruited off the streets.  One man, Percy, was a permanent employee, and they struck up a friendship during the 60s.  I never thought it was strange, but in hindsight, it probably was an unusual friendship.  A few years after Dad died, mom mentioned to me that she had recently received a visit from Percy.  In fact, she said Percy had visited her a other times since Dad's death.  She had never mentioned it before and I had no reason to ask.  But he apparently was checking in on mom to see \"how Joe's widow was doing.\"  Mom was grateful for the kind gesture and concern.  All of Dad's other \"friends\" disappeared after he died.  But with Percy I recognized another fact.  Percy was Dad's friend in life - separate and apart from the family.  Out of respect for Dad and their friendship, Percy felt the need to confirm that mom was getting back on her feet independently as a widow ... and after a few years, the visits stopped.  Dad never knew about Percy's kind actions, but I knew and I never forgot.I thought alot about Percy and my parents when I read this book.  I received two gifts from them: my parents provided me with a \"clean slate\" - no inherited racial prejudices, and Percy demonstrated how true friendship can cross racial boundaries.I'll leave this posting by sharing a story from the book.  Besides being a maid for a white family, Ailibeen took care of Mae Mobley Leefolt, the family's two year old child.  Ailibeen told Mae Mobley secret stories.  Mae Mobley's favorite TV show was My Favorite Martian.  One secret story went like this:(From The Help)********\"One day, a wise Martian come down to Earth to teach us people a thing or two,\" I say.\"Martian?  How big?\" ask Mae Mobley.\"Oh, he about six-two.\"\"What's his name?\"\"Martian Luther King.  He was a real nice Martian, Mister King.  Looked just like us, nose, mouth, hair up his head, but sometime people looked at him funny and sometime, well, I guess sometime people was just downright mean.\"I could get in a lot of trouble telling her these little stories, especially with Mister Leefolt.  But Mae Mobley know these our \"secret stories.\"\"Why Aibee?  Why was they so mean to him?\" she ask.\"Cause he was green.\"(To my readers who are local - I own this book.  Let me know if you would like to borrow it.)"},
{"title": "85th Birthday!", "date": "Sunday, February 13, 2011", "text": "(From left to right clock-wise, my husband, my daughter, my son, my son's girlfriend, mom and me.)\"Birthdays are good for you.Statistics show that the people who have the mostlive the longest.\"Larry LorenzoniThis month my mom celebrated her 85th birthday!  This year also marks her 5th year of living with us.  Here she is with us enjoying brunch at a local restaurant. She said she really enjoyed herself.  I am sure this was a treat because she can seldom go to restaurants now.  She can't walk too far and in typically noisy environments she has difficulty hearing.  But this restaurant, Michael's Pub, is not so crowded and is not as noisy as some.  It was a fun brunch for all of us.I have received a number of private messages asking how she is doing since the double hospitalizations and the 8 days in rehab in December.  It has been an effort, but she is doing much better.  She is back to doing all her own activities of daily living, such as dressing, bathing independently, coming down for all meals, making her bed, clearing her dishes, and getting ready for bed. She does her exercises everyday and takes walks - sometimes outside, but mostly in the house.  Each week we extend her walk by a minute.  She is up to 10 minutes of continuous walking.  She complains a lot about it, but that is mostly because I am constantly reminding her to not stop to look out the windows and to walk faster.   She grumbles and I nag, but she has increased from 4 minutes of walking to 10 minutes.  She practices climbing stairs as well.  To my current title of Caregiver, I sometimes describe myself as Drill Sargent!  But it is a title that I accept.  It would be far easier to just let her sit in a chair and not fight back to gain strength.  When I see her doing better even minimally, I am happy to be the Drill Sargent.  Of course, each hospitalization has taken something out of her, something that cannot be gained back through our efforts.  Avoiding the hospital continues to be our primary goal.  This month she is well, and we celebrate her 85 years of living!  Happy Birthday, Mom!"},
{"title": "Car Shopping - not fun!", "date": "Saturday, February 12, 2011", "text": "My least favorite thing to do in the world is to shop for a car!  But you will do absolutely anything for your child!The weekend began with the return of my daughter's leased vehicle - a Jeep Commander - very large, very expensive, filled with every bell-and-whistle and getting 12 miles per gallon.  Don't get me wrong, the Jeep got her through several terrible snow storms this year and last, but it would be an expensive vehicle to keep both in gas and upkeep, so she turned it in.This time she would purchase  car.  The pain and suffering of that purchase looks alot like this ...Our salesman started out like a caricature of every car sales man you have ever seen on TV.  My daughter and I had an appointment to meet with a salesman and the moment we walked into the show room he greets us with \"And there is the lovely Kristin and her sister.\"  I stopped him short with a withering look and he did improve a bit after he dropped the car salesmen charade.Nailing down the cost of the car always feels like the shell game at a sleazy carnival.   There is the cost of the car listed in inventory, and then there is the cost posted on the car, (hopefully the same, but ... ) and then there is the cost less the factory allowance and then there is the cost with dealer profit and then there is the fantasy that negotiation is even possible.  Why do you never feel like you got a \"good deal\".And there is always the \"unseen\" manager who the salesman consults with in between conversations with the perspective customer. Is that a real person or just a blow up doll staged behind a desk somewhere?And there is the talk with the customer service person to describe all the extra things you can get to protect, to enhance, to improve your car so that you prevent all sorts of terrible situations that might/can/will happen if you don't purchase these extras to the tune of up to $2,000 beyond the agreed upon price.And then there is the talk with the finance person who tries to sell you their financing and takes a second shot at you to include the \"protection, enhancements, and improvements\" in the cost of financing - \"See this will raise your payment only $$ per month, and this other thing will also add on $$ much per month more and then .....\" ). Well we survived and when all was said and done, our experience went fairly smoothly - it only took 3 hours from start to finish and it resulted in this car. A 2011 Subaru Legacy - in Pearl White.  And a smile on my daughter's face.  The Milo inspection."},
{"title": "Taking care of self? Why, yes!  I am just fine.", "date": "Thursday, February 10, 2011", "text": "So I went to my doctor yesterday.  Just a simple visit to fix a minor problem (of 4 months duration, but who is counting).He is a good guy.  I usually prefer women physicians. But this doctor is someone I worked with years ago, I know his medical perspective (he is not an \"over-tester or over-treater\"), and he has taken care of my husband and my son for years (at my recommendation), and now my daughter (again, at my recommendation), and several of my friends.  He is a good doctor!He is also good at getting to the \"meat-of-the-matter\" medically.  My minor problem was addressed promptly and an ointment prescription written, but he asked a few other pointed questions, and my few vague answers revealed some simple truths.  This winter I was busy taking care of everyone else ... but me!  Actually this isn't new behavior for me - most wives and mothers are guilty of this at some point in their lives.  For example: like many people of my age, I have a small problem with blood pressure.  It really is a small problem, and I take a low dose diuretic to correct it.  Except that all this winter, the pills I focused on were mom's.  Oh, I would occasionally pop one of my diuretics and feel noble about it. But I definitely wasn't taking it as directed on the container.  One day in January, when I was taking mom's blood pressure (her meds had changed and we were monitoring it), I checked my own!  Oops!  140/90.  I always run 120/70 or less.  Well, I guess \"always\" is not totally accurate.  So I took my meds for 3 days (3 days in a row rather than one day per week for 3 weeks - but you didn't hear that from me) and I rechecked my blood pressure - 110/75!  Hmmm!  Guess I still need that dag-gon pill after all! Darn! And I may have done some artful administration with my cholesterol meds as well.And being a smart doctor who knows me, he asked more questions about why I fell off the pill wagon - \"I've been busy\"  or maybe I said \"Hospitals and Rehab facilities can make you crazy\" or some version of the last two months of joy and frivolity - summing it up with \"I am fine.\" He totally ignored my assessment.  He asked me about my sleep habits.  My response?  \"I sleep just fine\" or maybe I said \"I sleep some most nights\" or some rendition of that theme.  And he asked other such questions that I also answered skillfully or maybe it was partially (my selective memory protects me from remembering conversations with difficult questions to answer - or maybe it is difficult answers to easy questions).  Whatever! *sigh*So my carefully worded conversation with my doctor resulted in some blood tests to find out where I am health wise - (and objectively - since my assessment raised his eye brows).  I guess he doesn't put much weight in my medical opinion - the one that says \"I am just fine!!\"   :-)For the record - I am just fine!  My husband smiles and is waiting for a more professional opinion!  Whatever!!"},
{"title": "#11 Personal Peace", "date": "Wednesday, February 9, 2011", "text": "We all know people who seem happy and sunny all the time, as well as others who never seem to have a good day and always see the unhappy side of life.  Whether these two sides of the coin are the result of habit, or chemistry or genetics is the discussion of many self-help books. Being happy and peaceful mentally is usually my default state - what my personality eventually settles down to unaided - regardless of the stress trigger.  I would like to say that I am fully responsible for my generally happy and positive outlook on life, but I also guess that there may be a genetic \"gift\" involved in the mix as well.But life can send you a massive unexpected curve ball or a loss from the most unlikeliest of places, and that happy state of mind is extinguished in the blink of an eye.  All of us have experienced this situation to a greater or lessor extent.  You struggle to find answers, adjust your thinking and move on.  From my perspective, adjusting and moving on has never required much effort - now I find it requires purposeful action.  It should probably be on my list of goals.That is where I am now: adjusting and accepting a new reality, working my way back to a happy, peaceful state, and moving on.  And each day I make progress and the moving on gets easier.  These activities help.Think things through and make positive choices for yourself (sometimes very difficult ones), and then live your life with those choices in mind.Time - time is my friend.  No matter what the problem is, time and space usually heals.  Exercise - walking almost always makes the unbearable - bearable. It doesn't \"fix\" things, but it provides a brief respite when the world seems better than just a short time ago. Cleaning - when I am unsettled, I find myself ... (I know you will find this unbelievable) ... I find myself cleaning house. Even aggressively cleaning bathrooms becomes a barometer of my mental state.  Right now my bathrooms could be cleaner - guess that is a good sign.  :-)  De-cluttering becomes a focus - simpler environments always settle my mind.  Lately I have been a de-clutter maniac.  Listening to audio books and pod casts and reading - these mental distractions are effective as well.Seek the company of friends. Thankfully I have an abundance of wonderful people in my life.Pray.So what do you do when you are looking for a way to redirect your mind and to cope with stress or a loss?"},

{"title": "On a Mission", "date": "Monday, February 7, 2011", "text": "The last 2 days have been fairly productive in clean out, reorganize and de-clutter arena. For a non-cook, I had one heck of a lot of cook books.  At least half of them haven't been touched for a year.  Now they are at Good Will making someone else's life taste better.  And in doing that I freed up 2 shelves in the basement den, shelves which now house yarn that was living on the den floor for the last 6 months.  That is just a temporary move, of course. I have a closet full of yarn that needs sorting and reduction, knitting books that need thinning and shelves of other random books that need to be moved out.  Making my surroundings lighter feels good for my psyche.Then today I took a hard look at my kitchen.  Since I am not a hobby cook (I am more of a cook-to-survive cook), I haven't placed much focus on the tools I use.  I had 2 pots that looked dreadful inside - coated pots that chips and scratches in the non-stick surfaces.  I try not to think about the fact I probably ate some of those little non-stick pieces.  And my silverware was really yucky.  We had two very cheap sets that were dented, scratched, worn or bent - and missing various pieces.  Then today I noticed that a rubber gasket on my coffee pot was torn and hanging, making for a messy brewing function each morning. So we took off to the store. I got a new Kitchen Aid 10 cup coffee pot (my other one was Kitchen Aid and we had it for years - the longest of any coffee pot previously - love that brand!).  Then my husband found a 12 piece pot and pan set of Anolon Advanced Nonstick on deep discount at Bed, Bath and Beyond, and we had a 20% off coupon as well, making it hard to pass up.  Minimally I was interested in replacing only 2 pots, but when we found this deal, I was able to get rid of quite a few old pots (2 that were over 40 years old and haven't been used in 15 years). Pictured are 4 of the pieces.And we purchased a new set of utensils. I went with an old standby,  Oneida,  in the pattern called Lincoln: a nice simple design with more heft than either of our two older sets. We got place settings for 16 with service pieces.  We seldom have 16 guests, but they were packaged in settings for 8. Eight was too few, so we bought 2 packages.  The purchases were long overdue - and the time was now.When the dust settled on the cleaning and replacing this afternoon ... I had created 3 boxes of kitchen stuff for Good Will donation and 3 bags of trash for the county Land Fill.  The household spaces where I worked are now less cluttered and more functional.  I am still not into cooking, but when I am forced to do so, it will be a pleasure to use my new stuff.  And the kitchen surfaces now have a nice uncluttered look.The downstairs den still has great de-cluttering promise. I also have my eye on my closet, the hall closet, the upstairs pantry, downstairs pantry and the downstairs kitchen equipment storage.  Once again I am focused on de-cluttering.My de-clutter history is limited to infrequent clean outs, sort throughs, pitching, donating re-org days.  Whole days.  Those days would be preceded by some big emotional event, a bad mood, or a major frustration that would launch me into a whorl wind of activity aimed at lighting my \"stuff inventory\".  Lightening my stuff made me feel lighter and less overwhelmed.  My stuff inventory still remains frighteningly high even after years of such frantic episodes.  Obviously these clean out episodes haven't come frequently enough.  So I am breaking the \"whole day\" clean outs, and doing some stuff each day - areas that randomly come to my attention.  In addition, my previous habit of doing a \"once thru\" on evaluating what stays and what goes and calling it finished seems faulty for me.  I did a once-through on books recently - got rid of alot.  And when I looked at the \"keep\" books again a few days later, more popped out asking to be sent to a new home.  I believe I get emotionally attached to stuff which clouds my decision making on \"to keep or not to keep\" and once I thin the crowd of things under review, doing a further review of the same stuff makes tossing stuff easier.  And I always feel good making space, thinning the \"stuff load\" at my house.Feeling good in getting rid of things is probably just a personal quirk of mine, but how do you handle the act of shedding stuff?  How do you decide what to keep and what to toss?  Are you a keeper or a tosser by nature?  And how does it make you feel once you have lightened your load?  I am off to tackle some other areas that have come to my attention - pockets of belongings that are no longer needed in my life.  And while I am doing this physical de-clutter task, I am doing a mental inventory of the same kind - deciding what to keep and what to discard so that I can lighten my load mentally and emotionally as well."},

Today felt like one of those days.It started out a bit shaky.  I was worried about my knee from yesterday's fall.  As I rolled over in bed this morning and decided to get up, I braced myself for knee pain. I fretted that this injured knee would set me back on walking, again!! Shock! Almost no pain ... in my knee.  But my neck ... now that was another matter.  My neck was just fine if my head remained upright, balanced on my shoulders, but when I bent over (like to get out of bed), a muscle in my neck tightened up in a serious way.  Darn!  I popped 600 mg of Advil with my morning coffee and that controlled the pain in my neck. The knee and the neck wouldn't get in the way of my walking.   Great!  I can live with that. Lunch was shared with an old friend from a previous neighborhood.  Thirty years ago we lived several doors down from each other.  Our children played and walked to school together, and we became friends.  We both moved away from that old neighborhood, but over the years our paths crossed several times, and we would catch up on our lives and that of our families.  Some friendships seem to stand the test of time.  They don't require lots of tending, they allow each person to change and evolve without judgement, and they respect each other's differences as well as being joyful in the similarities.  That is what I have with this friend.  And that was what I needed on this day.  We laughed and enjoyed each other's company as if nothing has changed over the 30+ years.  Lots of things have changed, but basically we haven't. It was really great.Coming home I was glad to find mom was doing well.  She sometimes gets anxious when I have been gone, for no real reason other than I am not in the house.  She is a worrier, always has been.  It isn't something you can talk her out of after 84 years of worry. But today she seemed good. No negative reactions to my absence.  I was batting a 1000 in the \"great day department\"!And to top off this great day, I finished a pair of knitted socks I started in January 2009.  I consider that a very good sign.  All of last year I dabbled around doing bits and pieces of my hobbies, but I focused on nothing and finished little.  It wasn't so great.  My hobbies have always been an important element in my happiness.  Finishing these socks really felt great.Really, really great. And they will look just great on my daughter's feet!Last day of January 2011.  The month started out very badly, but I am glad to see it is ending with a bang! A great bang!Now to get more Advil!"},

They were popping up all over the neighborhood and some of them were very cute.The remains of the snow storm made the footing a bit more difficult today.  Melting had occurred all over the neighborhood, and almost as quickly, as the water drifted over the sidewalks, it re-froze.  The ice was sometimes hard to identify until you were upon it.And our parking lot is still being cleaned out.  We can get in and out with no problem but the side walks and the parking spaces have been huge obstacles for mom.  She has been home bound a lot lately.  But each day I make sure she takes \"her walks\" around the house for 8 minutes.  She is tired after that.  Next week I am going to bump it up to 9 minutes. She has also been very good about doing her daily exercises.Despite the fact I have been supremely careful when out for my walks ... today I fell.  I have been keeping to the streets.  As you can see, many of the sidewalks not attached to residences are snow covered, as well as blocked by fallen branches.  This road looked very clear - no snow or ice, so I was allowing my thoughts to drift when my left foot tripped and I fell forward.  Can you see what tripped me up?  Here is a closer look.  Stupid stick - firmly buried in the curb side snow.I got up carefully and did a body-check!  Everything seemed in working order so I continued on my walk.  But now, while I sit at my computer, my left knee is sending me signals that maybe I was a bit premature on the body-check.  I felt like I could walk longer than I did, but it was close to lunch time and mom would be wandering around the kitchen looking for something to eat.  Over the last 4 1/2 years, her ability to make choices - even the most simple ones - has deteriorated greatly.  If left to her own resources, she would have cheese and crackers for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I am a big fan of cheese and crackers, and we always have them in the house.  And I sometimes have that instead of a regular meal, but a steady diet of that isn't healthy.  And she can't seem to see anything else.  So I headed home.  But I am really encouraged that my body is once again adjusting to the exercise of walking.I feel happier today.  I am making an effort to focus my thinking of happier thoughts and avoid those memories that bring me down.  Keeping busy helps too.  And walking is the backbone of it all.  This afternoon I am going to get out my spinning wheel and spin.  It is a good day!"},

The snow still clings to the all the trees and plants in a way that is reminiscent of a holiday card.  This storm surely did cause havoc in our area, but it left beautiful scenes behind.  My walk today was very hit or miss.  Most side walks were cleared in my area, but sometimes I was forced to step into the street. It wasn't a major problem.And the walk gave me some very needed private time to sort through my turbulent thoughts.  December and January have been difficult months in our household. So much of this time has been spent sick, fatigued, worried, angry, or upset. It has drained me so much that I hardly sleep at times, and find keeping focused on the regular things of life difficult. Peace has been missing, and I wanted to find a way to get it back. Strangely, the answer didn't come in my walk.I read a posting from a blog I follow: The Totally Together Journal by Stephanie O'Dea.http://totallytogetherjournal.com/permission-granted/I encourage you to check it out. Stephanie O'Dea is also the author of two crock pot cooking books (Make It Fast, Cook It Slow and More Make It Fast, Cook It Slow - both excellent books.) The focus of this post was to be happy!  In fact, the title \"Permission Granted\" refers to permission being granted to be happy! Her blog post reminded me that happiness is a choice.  And recently I was watching an old Monk TV show and the same theme  - Choose to be happy! - was part of the story.  Both the blog and the TV show seemed to have a message directly aimed at me.By nature I am a happy person.  I have had times in my life when the problems have seemed overwhelming. I have always found a way to bounce back.  Big changes are happening in my life once again, changes beyond my control - and change always carries its own stress.  I need to stay focused on the gift nature gave me, the ability to be happy, to choose happiness and then peace will return.  I am sure of it.Thanks, Stephanie."},
{"title": "Mother Nature Paybacks", "date": "Thursday, January 27, 2011", "text": "When you are angry with Mother Nature - be sure to keep your angst to yourself!Last night we had a snow storm, but it left a big heavy foot print on our area.  It was a fast moving storm, with alot of moisture in it, and it left behind a very heavy snow - about 6-8 inches.  It was alot like wet cement.I enjoy snow storms, but I usually don't need to go out. I can sit by my window and enjoy the beauty of the natural event.  But last night the storm hit its stride around rush hour.  Each report on the news seemed to get more dire.  Snow, ice, freezing rain - all building up quickly and falling between the hours of 5 and 11.Under normal conditions, both my kids had an hour trip ahead of them when they left their jobs at 4:30 pm.  My daughter arrived at our house at 7:30 pm - 3 hours later.  My son made it to his house at 8:30 pm - fours hours later.  Terrible terrible trips. They reported problems with folks stranded in their cars along side the highway, four-wheel drive vehicles spun out off the road, buses pulled over because they couldn't make it up a gentle hill, near white-out conditions on route 95 hiding the road bed. Very dangerous.Thankfully they made it to their destinations safely.  My daughter says it was the most stupid thing she had ever done.  If she had known what she was driving into, she would have gone home (four miles from her job) rather than trying to drive to my house.  My son also had his periods of unease.  Each reported their vehicles handled the conditions well, but each were concerned about sharing the road with those who did not have the right kind of car or were traveling too fast for the conditions. This morning we awoke to a beautiful view.  Snow clung to all trees, bushes, roads, yards, sidewalks.  It was a very \"white\" scene.  Watching its beauty was eye candy.  But lifting the shovel filled with snow ... heavy with water ... was not so great. And as we shoveled, the trees were dropping their load of snow on our heads.  We are very tired tonight.  Tomorrow we will be very sore.Last week I had a winter tantrum - angry at Mother Nature for sending a nuisance snow - freezing spit - I think I called it. http://mynext20yearsofliving.blogspot.com/2011/01/winter-tantrum.htmlGuess she took me seriously!  She sent me a decent storm - but I see it as \"pay backs\" for giving her the finger for sending frozen spit last week.My apologies to  Mother Nature - and to everyone else who struggled through this storm last night.  The next time I am annoyed and requesting substantial weather - I will carefully word my angry response - making sure to describe EXACTLY what kind of storm I expect."},
{"title": "Winter's Day Chopping", "date": "Wednesday, January 26, 2011", "text": "Typically on a winter's day, if you are inspired to cook anything, I would bet it would be a stick-to-your-ribs stew, hearty chunky soup, bread that fills the house with a homey aroma or maybe a hot mulled apple cider. Those choices fill the magazine covers now.Not me.  I am usually not inspired by the covers of cooking magazines. Today I felt the need to cook - rather chop up - something different.  Some might say \"summery\" even.  I love to mix up a cold \"black bean and whatever\" salad with an olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper dressing.  Here is my latest creation.There is no recipe. It is always alittle different ... just whatever I feel like throwing into the bowl.  My cold salads typically have the dressing described above, and always black beans and fresh cilantro (I totally love cilantro) but sometimes fresh basil, sometimes I add garbanzo beans, canned corn, usually onions and celery and just whatever I have in the house. This time I added cauliflower and radishes - that was a first for those items.  There was another first.  Today I added pasta.  Here is a closer picture of the pasta.  Does it remind you of something?This was \"Dog Lover's Pasta\" and the pasta should look like paw prints.  I think it does when you look at it ... looking for a paw print!! What is too funny is that I also have \"Cat Lover's Pasta\" and they look exactly the same. :-)  I got these specialty pastas from a children's fundraising event last fall.I have said it before ... I am a big lover of winter.  But I am a big lover of summer dishes!!  There are cat people and dog people. I am a cat person! Shocking as that statement is to my neighbors (I am always walking dogs.), those who have known me for a while are not surprised.Over the last 41 years my husband and I have shared our lives with 9 cats.  The first 3 were friends with each other - not related but close in age. They slept together, they cleaned each other, they played together.  Life was simple.  So simple that we thought the next bunch would be the same - so why not get 4 cats!Life with the next 4 cats was like living in the Middle East - you never knew when hostilities would breakout, but it was a sad fact that they would. Peace was possible with major adjustments, frequent accommodations, and substantial barriers and bunkers. It was always a fragile peace.  But our cats are part of our family, so just as we wouldn't get rid of a kid because he didn't get along, we wouldn't get rid of any cat just because scud missiles would regularly fly.  It was a long 12-15 years for us humans!  But we loved  those 4 cats enough to commission an oil painting of them.  No, they never sat as close as they show in that painting.  Artists are skilled at making unlikely things look likely, look natural.  Don't they look like they are pals and just \"hanging out\" together on our deck during a sunny afternoon?  It is the way we like to remember them.  The painting hangs in our living room now.  It will be one of those items that our children fight over after we are gone. \"You take it.\"  \"No, you take it.\"  \"Please, I insist you take it.\"  \"Hell, no - I offered it to you first.\"  I guess it is too much to ask that they check with \"The Antiques Road Show\"!  :-)  (From the bottom clockwise:  Gandy, Alex, Teddy, and Cassie)Anyway, now peace has returned.  Maximilian and Wallace are the current cat residents.  They are brothers and were selected as kittens because they were a \"bonded\" pair - able to live with each other without the benefit of  bullet proof vests or automatic weapons.  Max is a stomach on legs. Food is what makes him tick.  Anything that remotely reminds him of food brings him on the run.  The rattle of a pill container or the crinkle of a bag can send the wrong message to \"the stomach with legs\".  He is not very smart, but the stomach is not the best organ to think with.He has degenerative kidney disease that will shorten his life, so while we have him we cherish every moment - even though we rank #2 behind his dinner.Wally is a thinker.  He is smart.  Frighteningly smart.  That means problems because a bored smart cat can be a terrible thing.  Bumps in the night, crashing sounds, puzzling out containers with secured lids, dancing on the computer keys - all are valid activities when you very smart ... and bored.  He loves dogs, even crazy ones like Milo who he is still trying to figure out!  And he loves my dog-walking coat.  When I am not wearing it, he is.He is healthy now except that he carries extra weight - we hear about that every single time we go to the vets.  I have had \"soul-searching conversations\" with Wally about his expanding waist line, but so far it has fallen on deaf ears.  The truth be told, cats seldom take anything you say seriously.  Selective hearing is one of their \"charming\" traits. Only a cat lover could call that charming, of course!  My grand-dogs are very dear to me, but if I had to choose between only cats or dogs,cats would win hands down!"},
{"title": "The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid by Bill Bryson", "date": "Tuesday, January 25, 2011", "text": "If you aren't familiar with Bill Bryson's work, you should really check out one of his books.  My all-time favorite of his, A Walk in the Woods, was reviewed in a previous post.  Currently I am reading The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid and it is every bit as good as A Walk in the Woods.Published in 2006, this work describes the author's growing up in Des Moines, Iowa - middle America - during the 1950s.  This story, however, is more than just a chronicle of his early life.  Bill Bryson shares his memories of a time when America was changing, growing, inventive, ... a time when all things seemed new and possible. As an added bonus, he invites you into his imaginative childhood world, where he donned the persona of the Thunderbolt Kid (later to be called Captain Thunderbolt), often influenced by the super heroes of the time.  He shares his remembrances of everything from the heyday of baseball, the unregulated life of a child in the 50s, cigarettes, sex, jobs and living in a new nuclear world ... to fictional characters as Superman, Roy Rogers, Sky King, Davy Crockett and Zorro.  He seems to reflect on everything.And, as expected, Bill Bryson has a way of seeing the world that at times is thought provoking and often funny.  This book is no different.  Each chapter begins with a quote from a local newspaper - quotes that often reflect the innocence and the culture then.  And the quotes are followed by a picture taken in the 50's. One of my favorite pictures shows an ad with a mature man who is obviously a doctor smoking a cigarette.  The bold words state:  \"More Doctors Smoke Camels Than Any Other Cigarette!\" It made me smile.  I wonder how many of those doctors died from lung cancer. Another picture shows school children kneeling down behind their desks with arms over their heads during an air-raid drill - part of the post World War II reaction to a possible nuclear attack.  I remember those drills very clearly. Looking back to my own childhood if we were ever attacked by a nuclear blast, our desks and our arms wouldn't have saved us.Reading this book is alittle like looking through an old family album of America, but the images are described in words.  For those who lived through this time, the images are formed by your own memories of the times - the names and places may be different but the life experiences are pretty universal.  And the enjoyment of this book is not limited to just the baby boomer generation - you just need to have been a child. So while this book includes his trade mark humorous observations on his youth (making the book worthwhile all by itself), it also includes a touching and nostalgic look back at America - a time that is long since gone, but is a part of who we are today.This is a great read!  One of his best works. Be sure to check it out. If any of my family or friends are interested in borrowing my copy, I am glad to share."},
{"title": "Waltzing to Rock Music!", "date": "Monday, January 24, 2011", "text": "Yarn was made this weekend.  And I did it. A beautiful brown, single ply, thick and thin, Merino and Bamboo yarn.  And I am now sure the decision I made 7 months ago to purchase a spinning wheel was the right one.The weekend began with the arrival of my cousin from Pennsylvania. She arrived with her spinning wheel, her new Kromski Harp loom and her knitting.  Her weekend was totally productive finishing some spinning, weaving (a gorgeous scarf - my pictures don't do it justice), work on a pair of socks (using 2 circular needles, toe up, doing 2 socks at one time, and her first cable pattern - the woman is invincible!), and she helped me get moving on this spinning thing.My focus was my spinning wheel only.  We started by taking the wheel out of its carrying case and digging around in the archive of my brain to remember how to put it together again.   My cousin spent time checking, oiling and testing the wheel to see if it was ready for the rookie spinner. It passed the test.Then began the inspection of the many fibers I had purchased last year - trying to find a good one for unskilled hands.  She prepared and attached a leader to my wheel and connected the unspun fiber. It was then time for me to \"sit behind the wheel\" so to speak, and do the deed. So I sat down with my cousins voice echoing in my head, \"You only get better by practice.\"  Hmm, ... practice. And the struggle began: pulling on the fiber too much or not releasing enough, peddling too slow and then too fast, drafting too much or not enough, stopping the wheel to fix all the funky stuff I caused after all the previous stuff I did ... all performed as if trying to dance the waltz to rock music. And the echo kept returning \"you only get better if you practice\" - so I plowed on.And then something happened.  I wasn't thinking about my feet so much.  I guess they figured out what they needed to do finally. That freed up some brain function.  And then I noticed that occasionally I was able spin continually for about 5 or 6 seconds before stopping.  Yes, that seems short, but  it is an improvement over spinning for 2-3 seconds before stopping. I also began to catch my own mistakes:  I still made them but I at least I saw them.And, I, too, worked on a pair of socks - but I was doing it the old fashion way: one at a time, top down, using double pointed needles.  My only real claim to fame on these beauties is that I am working on the foot of the second sock - so the end is within sight.  Since the start was January 2009 it is about time they were done.  I started out making them for me, but they will go to my daughter when they are complete.Having my cousin here for a visit tops the list of weekend treasures.  Spinning a bunch holds second place. Mom really enjoyed the visit - fascinated by the weaving.  And then there was the food (the corn bread and bacon vegetable soup were yummy at lunch on Saturday), and the wine (thank you Australia for Yellow Tail) was great, and the sharing (catching up on our lives, planning for future visits) was long overdue ... these weekends always great fun."},
{"title": "Winter Tantrum!", "date": "Tuesday, January 18, 2011", "text": "While standing in my PJs and robe, and drinking my morning coffee, I look out my kitchen window.  My eyes do not believe the view.  Is it possible that we have missed yet another snow storm here in Columbia.  I look outside my window again.  Nope, no real measurable snow - just frozen stuff.Its no secret I love big storms. Big snow storms.  Big, big snow storms.  And here we are in the middle January and we have only spit ... \"frozen spit\".I am done with this!! I put my coffee firmly down on the counter. I march purposefully across my kitchen floor.  I open the slider door. Carefully I step across my frozen deck.  I look up and raise my angry fist at the sky, saying all the four letter words that I know, (\"snow\" being one of them, of course) and then in a very loud ugly voice I scream: \"Frozen spit!Really??I am insulted!Is that the best you have?Can't give us a real storm!!Totally pathetic.D- in my book.\"And then my neighbor opens his window and peeks out. I freeze.  Our eyes lock.  My fist lowers slowly and becomes a wave. His eyes shift left and right, looking.  My other hand pulls my robe closed. He closes his window.I turn and step back to the house, but before I close the door, I raise my defiant fist once again to the cold gray sky. Well, really, it was just one finger this time.  I will let you pick which one.  :-)"},
{"title": "Time  and Choice - thoughts", "date": "Monday, January 17, 2011", "text": "Ask anyone you know, there is never enough time to include all the things we want in our lives.  There is work, family, exercise pursuits, the housework, cooking, pets, friends, and if you are lucky, there is leisure.  Fitting in all the commitments, meeting all the expectations, dealing with the frustrations and short comings of each - simply stated - keeping all the \"balls in the air\" never seems to fit within the scope of 24 hours.  Even if you love all these things, too many things cause stress.  And living with the constant pressure can wear you down physically and emotionally.  I know.  I have been there.Years ago I had a job that seemed to absorb most of the available hours in the day.  An argument can be made that I let it - but the fact was there was no \"me\" time.  My husband and I made pretty good salaries, and we felt the trade-offs for not having enough time were worth the money.  What little time was not spent working, was devoted to family issues.  The kids were teens and needed pieces of our time.  I couldn't ignore them - they weren't adults and we weren't finished raising them. And when we could carve out recreation, it was always expensive recreation.  We had the money and we needed big change to get a break from our regular overwhelming lives.  But I never sat down to read a book, or knit or take walks or find any time for \"me\".  Even when I watched alittle TV at night, I had work on my lap.  When I think back on that time, I think of it as a sad time.After years of living like that, I looked in the mirror.  The person looking back at me seemed like a stranger.  I saw everything in black and white - right or wrong.  I didn't have time for shades of gray.  I stopped caring about the needs of others, even with some people very close to me.  They were all functioning adults, they needed to take care of themselves,  and if they seemed to step out of line the least little bit - whether it was true or not - I moved on.  No time for that.  Relationships take time.  I didn't have time. I was busy, busy, busy.  It was a super-sized life. And I never once considered that maybe I was the problem.  Maybe I was trying to squeeze too much into 24 hours.  Maybe I was the one who was falling short in managing my own 24 hours.Since then I quit that job.  And I eliminated many optional things (I kept the kids - and I am glad I did 'cause they turned out sensational.)  Yes, we had less money.  We had to \"make-do\" more often.  But we survived and the person I saw in the mirror after a time was someone I recognized once again - because all the qualities in me that I hold dear weren't really gone, they were just beaten down with \"not enough time\".I have decided to stop wishing for more time. We all have the same 24 hours. I am the manager of my own personal 24 hours.  If I am unhappy with the way my own 24 hours plays out, I am the only one who can do anything about that.  And that is where choice comes in.It has been my mantra years.  \"You always have a choice.\"   You have the choice to quit a job that is too demanding, to get another one even if it pays less. You have a choice to leave the house dirty or to hire a house keeper. You have a choice to say \"no\" to commitments that might be more than you can manage at present.  You have a choice to eliminate stressers from your life (Keep the kids, though! That worked out great for me).  Taking those steps can be difficult, making hard critical choices about what needs to go and what can stay in your life is really really hard.  But it is worth it if you are still recognizable when you look in mirror.  I have decided that time and choice are intimately linked. My life is simpler now.  I learned that lesson very well years ago.  Keep it simple.  We don't have the money we once had, but we have more time.  I didn't say I wasn't busy - there are days when I feel like I am just treading water.  Care giving is often that way.  But it is simpler - mostly because I made it that way.  When mom was hospitalized, I knew exactly what to do when I felt overwhelmed.  I cut my life to the bone - and focused on only those things that mattered in that moment - and at that moment it was mom.   It was still stressful, but not impossible.And for those who would argue that I have simplified this whole topic too much, that there are some lives that are impossibly busy, overwhelming, and can't be avoided ... I would say ... there are always choices. Always."},
{"title": "HiyaHiya Interchangeable Needles - A Review", "date": "Thursday, January 13, 2011", "text": "These little gems found their way to my home on Tuesday.  Pictured are my new HiyaHiya interchangeable knitting needles in their beautiful fabric cases. I purchased them at And Sew It Goes, http://www.andsewitgoes.net/- a quilt and knitting shop located in Savage Mill, Maryland.I have several sets of interchangeable knitting needles acquired over 10 years.  Each manufacturer offers slightly different qualities in their interchangeables.  The HiyaHiya sets shown here provide the best options of all the manufacturers I have tried.On first glance, the fabrics used to create the cases are beautiful.  The picture shows 2 cases - blue and purple.  I also saw a red case and a turquoise case.  Picking a case color was hard.  The colors are bold, vibrant ... very eye catching.  The cases are constructed compactly - measuring approximately 6x6 inches square - and are small enough to fit in a purse.  In addition, there are 2 zippered pockets for notions. When opened, there is a flap of fabric that covers the needle tips and is held in place with Velcro.  A tie is used to close the case.  From my perspective, the case is one of the selling points for these needles.  Small, compact, organized and beautiful.Upon examining the needles, it becomes evident that this manufacture has provided the largest choice of needle sizes ranging from size 2 (unusual) through size 15 US.  To get the full range of sizes you would need to buy two sets (small set has size 2-8, and large set has size 9-15 - as shown).  This is an improvement over other manufacturer's offerings.  Most in my knitting group felt that sizes 2-8 would be most useful.  I like the fact that you can focus your purchase to buy exactly the needles that you would normally use rather than including sizes you would seldom use.Another common complaint about interchangeables is the quality of the  join where the knitting needle meets the cable.  I have a set of Addi Turbo Interchangeable - a gift from Christmas 2009, and I find their join to be less than adequate - it catches the yarn as you knit.  My other sets (Denise and Knit Picks - both cheaper sets than Addis) are actually better than Addis set in that regard.  The HiyaHiya has a very smooth join - better than all the others. The cable and the needle heads screw together rather than snapping or being tightened with a \"key\" of some sort.The price point for these needles tends to fall below the Addi Turbo Interchangeable but above the Denise and Knit Picks Interchangeables.  If you buy both the small and large HiyaHiya sets, then the price point falls in the range of the Addi Turbos, but with the Addis you are getting fewer needle heads.And so I am thrilled with my purchase, and I would recommend them to knitters as the best option available on many levels.  But knitting needles are like purses or wallets - each person has their own idea of what makes a great knitting needle. The needs and expectations of each knitter are different.  However, if you are selecting your first set of Interchangeable Knitting Needles - please check out these beauties.  I think you will be impressed.This snow has lingered and it has held it beauty in many ways. Here are some views right outside my back door. A picture perfect snow. They are well fed, don't you think?  :-)"},
{"title": "Goals - OK, I lied.", "date": "Wednesday, January 12, 2011", "text": "*Sigh*I said I wouldn't do this.  But I will.  (So will you ever be able to believe anything I say?)In 2010 I had goals. I worked out what they would be during the whole month of January.  That should have been a big red flag right there - who takes a whole month to work out goals!! Indecision? Maybe.  Commitment issues? Possibly.  A forecast of my mental state for the year?  You betcha!   This year I have a few goals.  But I am going to keep it simple.  If 2011 is anything like 2010 - no point in getting carried away with big plans.Goal #1 - Get Focused!Last year was a \"craft ADD year\" for me.  I couldn't focus on one thing if my crafting life depended on it.  After Thanksgiving, there was a great wasteland of nothing-ness. I went from doing a gazillion different things and to doing nothing, na-da, zilch. Gotta do better this year.Goal #2 - Use 5,000 yards of yarn.  I have an embarrassing amount yarn.  Last year I decided to count the yards of yarn in my stash (a diversionary tactic to keep from doing actual knitting, you understand).  Based on my totals as of May - if I knitted 5,000 yards of yarn a year, I wouldn't run out of yarn until 92 years of age (gads!).  I am 63 - you do the math.  I went on an immediate yarn diet, but broke it this month when I rewarded myself. http://mynext20yearsofliving.blogspot.com/2011/01/rewards-good-thing.html, Still, 5,000 yards a year is a reasonable goal.  Goal #3 - Spin.Now you wouldn't think that a person who has as much yarn as I have would need to make more yarn.  You would be wrong.  I have a great spinning wheel, several lovely spindles and a bag full of beautiful fiber.  My spinning cousin is coming for a weekend visit in a few weeks, and my plan is for her to help me get launched using my wheel.Goal #4 - Weave on my hand looms.A new craft this year and two projects underway. Yeah ... this needs more of my attention.  I love the look of the finished product.Goal #5 - Complete 2 knitting projects - and maybe more.I have 2 projects I am working on presently: a pair of socks I started in January 2009 (yes, 2 years ago ... don't go there), and a sweater I started in June of 2010.  There are a few other projects that are in my mental list to begin (a sweater for Kris, another sweater for Milo, a shawl for mom, and a sweater, vest or shawl for me), but I am refusing to start them until these 2 are done.  Well, we will see how long that lasts.  Five goals - few enough to be do-able, nonspecific enough to be achievable, inclusive enough to keep me connected to the stuff I want to do.Keeping my fingers crossed!"},
{"title": "One Joy of Winter", "date": "Tuesday, January 11, 2011", "text": "Snow!I am a huge fan of winter and all of its faces ... including the white bearded winter face of snow.  Tonight our first snow of the season has arrived - a measly 3-4 inches is predicted.  But it counts - it is not a dusting - like previous snows.I love the snowy view from my front step.  I live on a terraced hill, up from the street.  The shadows of the trees, the brightness of the street light, the quiet of the snow covered road that curves into my development, always fills me with a peaceful feeling. My peaceful feeling this night was not shared by my unexpected house guests.  Tonight Meathead and Grimace are having a sleep-over with grandma.  And since neither one of them can use the toilet, we went for a walk.  Tell me.  Does this look like a \"peaceful\" face?And here's a trick question.  Are they dragging me into or out of my house on this beautiful evening?Their only goal was this!!\"Grandma, we saved the middle spot for you.  Put the camera down and come to bed.\""},
{"title": "Favorites of 2010", "date": "Monday, January 10, 2011", "text": "I know.  This is not an original idea or post. But I like the idea of remembering what is special from the previous year! So before the month of January 2011 totally slips away, here is my list of \"2010 Special Favorites\".  They are in no particular order. Believe me, narrowing it down to 10 was hard. So here goes.1.  My kids - Everyone says their kids are special.  But this year my kids did more for me than just be \"my kids\".  Previous posts tell the story.  It is sufficient to say that they demonstrated in small, quiet ways what wonderful adults they have become.  2.  My coat - Ok, so I agree this sounds strange.  But my dog-walking coat was my friend so many times in December.  To state the obvious, it is a warm coat even if it makes you look 15 pounds heavier.  This coat goes all the way down to my ankles and when the collar is pulled up, it covers me to above my ears so a hat is seldom necessary. And at the  hospital, this coat served as my blanket many many times, and at other times it was a wonderful pillow.  I was never too hot or too cold.  It is the best coat I have ever had - and last month - it was my best friend.And when I am not wearing my coat, Wally is wearing it.  No joke.  The coat has a rustling sound when it is moved and I always hear it slipping to the floor.3.  My mom - I have learned alot about myself through taking care of mom. Last year the lessons learned unveiled many of my short comings.I am not the patient person I always thought I was.  I am learning patience.  I am not as understanding about the complexities and frustrations of aging as I thought. I am peeking inside the aging process.  It is pretty scary in there.I am not as generous or kind a person I think I am.  True generosity and kindness is expressed when you respond to a need without being asked and when there is no expectation of recognition.  Learning, learning, learning.4.  Big snow storms - My God!  I love a big, big snow storm.  And in 2010 we counted our snow in\"feet\".  It was very big!5.  My blog - Who would have thought writing to yourself could be so rewarding!!  6.  Tuesday knitting group - My Happy Pill.  Boy, if I could stick my knitting group into a bottle and sell it, the world would be a better place (and I'd be rich) ... or maybe we would all just warmer in hand-knit stuff.7.  Tai Chi -  I returned to Tai Chi last Wednesday after missing 6 weeks - my legs were very unhappy!  The rest of me was thrilled!  8.  Time with cousins and my sister -   Simply stated ... I don't get enough.9.  My four-legged family members - Max, Wally, Meathead, Grimace and Milo.  It's a real zoo here sometimes!This is Max.  He isn't allowed on the kitchen table.  He is on the kitchen table.  And, in typical cat fashion, he seems to be saying, \"No, I am  not on the kitchen table and, no, I am not checking out your purse for cookies - and there are no cookies in there, just in case you were wondering.10.  My good health!  This year I did little to improve or even maintain my good health.  At the risk of making my daughter totally nuts - I will share.  I didn't do the walking I wanted to do.I didn't always eat right. I sometimes missed taking my pills (this week I went back on my blood pressure medicine when I causally discovered that my pressure WASN'T normal on its own *sigh*. I bet the same can be said of my cholesterol medicine).In December borrowed aggressively against my good health with lack of sleep and worry.And I am still relatively healthy.  But not stupid.  I am back to focusing on me (when I'm not focused on mom.)So that is my list. Do you have a list?Today's walk: 4458 steps, 1.8 miles, 36 minutes"},
{"title": "More steps towards normalcy", "date": "Sunday, January 9, 2011", "text": "Normalcy!  Not sure what that is anymore.  So many events, people, activities ... got pushed out of December and moved into January.  As a result, January is turning out to be exceedingly busy.But we did some normal things this weekend.Last night we celebrated \"Christmas Eve\" - well, I guess it was more like New Year's Eve.  Our December 24th guests, our son and his girl friend and her parents, came to dinner last night.  We weren't sure how many people were coming.  I had initially planned for 12 possibles, but the numbers slipped and in the end we had 6. The further you move away from the holidays, the harder it is to get everyone together.  Schedules are so busy.Although I don't care for daily cooking, I do like preparing a big meal for a group.  And it is always fun to open the table up and set it.  In reality my fully extended table doesn't actually fit in the room.  We need to angle it from one corner to the other to make it fit. But with only 6 people it felt a little like we were sitting at a large formal table where everyone sits several feet away from each other. :-)  We don't have \"formal\" anything for the table, so it was hardly fancy.  Regardless, it was great to have a smaller informal gathering with such lovely people.    The next normal thing happened this morning.  Mom awoke a bit shaky - not feeling all that well (and lately that has been our \"normal\").   She did not feel well enough last night to come to with our guests ... which was a shame - she needs more social  opportunities.  But this morning she got dressed and came down for breakfast and then announced she was well enough for church.  So we went.  And it did her good to get out of the house and attend Mass.  It was an effort for her to be sure, but when she got seated in the church, she looked so much better with the smile on her face. And it was heart-warming to see people she knew greeting her and welcoming her back.  Her name was still in the Church Bulletin with others who needed prayers.So the weekend had some normal things in it - more normal than anything we have done in awhile.   And it is beginning to feel a little more like my normal life."},

{"title": "With my \"peoples\"", "date": "Tuesday, January 4, 2011", "text": "After being forced to miss 5 weeks of knitting group, I returned today with knitting and camera in hand.  And it was restorative. And although some folks don't care to have their picture taken, everyone was gracious and happily posed for the picture.  (and I am sure that my causal mention of tears if anyone refused had no bearing on their decision to participate.)  :-)Of course I had missed a bunch of conversations over those missed weeks - there was an interesting match-making  arrangement underway.  And then there was a conversation about a clown and a hobo and some sort of pleasurable event (you had to be there for that one!).  Oh yes, there was knitting as well.  It is a knitting group, after all.It is hard to express just how much I missed this group.  They are my weekly \"happy pill\".  These are my \"peoples\".  How can you not be happy when surrounded by such wonderful friends and talented knitters.Hope you have a group like that! http://nathanmarz.com/blog/you-should-blog-even-if-you-have-no-readers.htmlI stumbled upon a posting with a title that caught my eye.  You Should Blog Even If You Have No Readers.  Catchy title and it seemed to mirror my own ideas.  But reading this excellent posting, I realized that I was clearly blogging for very different reasons than the writer suggests.My apologies to Nathan Marz, the writer of the posting, if I have failed to capture the essence of what he wrote.  I encourage you to follow the link and read the posting in his own words.Mr. Marz espouses that writing makes you a better reader.  Through writing you learn to organize your own thoughts and find holes in your reasoning.  Writing allows your thoughts become words on a paper where they are more easily examined rather than ideas floating in your mind.  And through the writing process you are better able to see the strengths and flaws of your own work as well as the work of others.  He makes several other points, but in short, writing makes you a smarter and a better person.Early in my blogging journey, I discovered that writing was a reward in itself, but I wasn't sure why.  I don't have a product to sell.  There is no religious or political message I want to deliver.  I don't even have a creative talent like art, music or photography I wish to share.  And while I agree with the ideas in Mr Marz's post, I don't do this to be a smarter or a better person.  Over time writing has helped me sort out why I enjoy blogging. There are so few times in life where you can have the total flexibility and freedom of self expression. Selecting topics, expressing thoughts and ideas, sharing fun experiences or life's difficulties, publishing on your own schedule, capturing the right pictures  ... all these are rewards for me.  But there is more. The blogging process slows me down.  It gives me time to think and write about things that are important just to me.  It forces me to find joy in the everyday occurrences of life and sometimes even in bad situations. It houses the memories of the large and the small events of living.  Mr. Marz would probably see my reasons for blogging as \"side benefits\".  And maybe they are, but if it wasn't for the side benefits, I would close this blog down.  And as for writing even if you don't have readers?  The idea of a readership has grown and sprouted legs with me.  I am not sure why.  It has been fun to reconnect with some people who I seldom see.  I love the idea that someone just might be reading what I write and have taken the time to write a comment.  Would I stop writing if everyone went away ... absolutely not.  The blogging process is for me.   The reader interaction is icing on the cake.  But I like cake more.I blog as if someone is reading, or not."},
{"title": "First Walks of 2011 - and Max the dog", "date": "Monday, January 3, 2011", "text": "Rainy, damp, cool - that was January 2 - yesterday - and I walked.  And it was a terrible walk.  Within the first 2 minutes I was reminded by various parts of my anatomy that I had fallen on January 1st. I was out at 5:30 am with  Meathead who needed a walk. It was a chilly, quiet New Years Day morning - and still dark. I walked down a grassy slope. Suddenly my right foot started to slide and then my right leg folded under me at an odd angle while the rest of me rolled to the left. It was an awkward fall.  I did a quick body-check and counted myself lucky that I was not injured.However the little aches from the fall made themselves known on my first walk of the year: my right knee, then my right calf, then my left big toe, then my right heel and so on. Heck, it was a complete nag, nag, nag for about 30 minutes.  I decided right then that tomorrow I would take a handful of Advil before going out.  Ok, maybe just 3 Advil would do.  No sense risking liver failure just to get a walk in.I walked 1.7 miles - 4,375 steps in 34 minutes. So that those are my baseline stats for 2011.  No where to go but up!! Today, January 3, it was sunny, I was loaded up with Advil and ready to do the second walk of the year!! It was hugely better.  No little reminders of my fall.  Just a constant reminder that I have lost endurance with all my false starts in 2010.  The fatigue will lift with time.I walked 1.8 miles -4,530 steps in 34 minutes.  Slightly more mileage and steps in the same amount of time as yesterday.  And this year I plan to track stats only related to my walks - just like my good friend Happy One.  As I was swinging past the ball park I was pleasantly surprised to see my \"dog friends\" out going through their retrieval practice.  The day was perfect for running and enjoying life.Those folks who read my post from early December(http://mynext20yearsofliving.blogspot.com/2010/12/break-out-winter-walk.html) will remember these 2 dogs and their owner.  At the time they were going through a retrieval regimen in our local ball park. ... just like today.  I couldn't help myself.  I stopped to talk to him.The dog I identified as a lab mix is, in fact, a full lab, bred from championship lines well-known in the retrieval competitions.  His name is Max.  Max has participated in a few competitions, but is now being trained to become a Search and Rescue dog.  How cool is that!  His owner stated that retrieval competitions use real birds instead of the orange bumpers.  He doesn't want Max retrieving birds.  He wants him to be focused on finding humans and the bird retrieval would be a distraction.  The dog I identified as a full poodle was, in fact, a Labradoodle - a mix of a lab and a poodle. (Hey, at least I knew they were both dogs!! ;-) )  His owner pointed out that the Labradoodle wasn't so focused in his training - guessing the poodle side of his personality was a little more dominant.  He sure looks like a poodle even up close.  But he is put through is paces regardless.Everyone in our house is well! (No easy feat!)  So January 3 is a great day for a whole bunch of reasons!  Hope your January 3 was great as well."},
{"title": "Rewards - a good thing!", "date": "Sunday, January 2, 2011", "text": "Several days ago I visited my local yarn shop (LYS).  For me that shop is All About Yarn! http://www.allaboutyarn.com/ It has been awhile since I visited the shop, and I discovered big changes had been made.  The shop was able to expand its showroom by expanding the back room into what looked like yarns for babies and children.  Very appealing.  In addition, they were able to create a classroom space - very important for a yarn shop.  Finally they gained more storage space - freeing up their current storage space for an office. Very nice changes.The shop is appealing as well because it is run by 2 women and their daughters as shown in the picture.Since my daughter was at home with mom, I decided to stop in for a visit to my LYS on my way out to get the grand dogs.  It had been about 6 months since I had stopped in.  This past year I avoided visiting yarn shops and online shops because I was on a self-imposed yarn diet.  When you have enough yarn to open a small store - you need to put the breaks on yarn purchases.  And that was what I did since April.  But my spirits needed a lift and a yarn store always does that for me.While there I decided that I needed a reward for surviving the last 6 dreadful weeks.  I didn't know exactly what the reward would be, but I knew it was waiting patiently for me in this shop.  I just needed to discover where it was hiding.  I love playing \"hide and seek\" in a yarn shop.The trouble with having an expansive yarn stash is that finding new yarns that call to me is harder.  When I did my yarn inventory last winter I was very pleased to discover that I still LOVED all the yarns I selected over the years.  I was still eager to use all of them. But now new yarns have to be very special for me to buy them.  Still the thrill of the chase - the hunt - add to my enjoyment of the purchase when an ideal candidate for inclusion in my yarn \"collection\" is found.Such was the case this trip.  I searched and searched throughout the shop.  Many beautiful yarns and many new books.  But nothing called my name.  And then, without warning, something did catch my eye.  A beautiful fire engine red Namasta faux leather bag called Monroe.  It was a bit smaller than my other Namasta bag which was more of a large tote.  The Monroe is a cross between a purse and a tote bag.  The more I examined it the more excited I got.  Many pockets, zippers, magnet closures, room for a knitting project, but also room for a wallet, note pad, keys and stuff.  And my iPad, phone and iPod Touch would fit as well.  I loved it.  On my arm it went.  I made one more sweep of the shop - and discovered that the bag also came in black and a deep purple - called Egg Plant. The picture doesn't do the purple color justice.  The red was definately beautiful, but purple seemed more my style. As I was rounding the store, in a basket on the floor was a beautiful Rainbow Shawl kit by Fiddlesticks Knitting in the collective colorway called Earthy: Basil, Curry, Sable, Copper, Suede and Bottle Green.  Don't those colors just sound wonderful?   The yarn is JaggerSpun, Zephyr Wool-Silk:  50% Merino Wool and 50% Silk.  Very soft.  The shawl pattern is done in an easy to work Feather and Fan lace pattern and is recommended for beginner lace knitters or TV watching for the more experienced!  Sold!  I have done the pattern before and have done lace as well.  This was the yarn and pattern that was calling my name.I left the shop feeling very good.  This year has been a very slow knitting year for me.  I couldn't seem to get moving on projects.  Even when I spent all that time sitting in the hospital and rehab - I didn't knit much - maybe 4 rows on a sock in 6 weeks.  I guess worry and fatigue had a killing effect on my hobbies.  But the desire to knit and complete stuff is growing again.  I need to get my stash/collection organized and get moving on some real projects.  I am eager to pick up my handweaving looms again as well.  And there is a spinning wheel that is just screaming at me all the time.  The spinning wheel, called Agatha, will get her turn when my spinning cousin comes for a visit later in the month.  I really need more hands on instruction.My other Namasta bag?  As you can see, it is a lovely Celery Green color.  I gave it to my daughter.  Milo has a lot of \"needs\", and she hauls his stuff to my house every weekend.  Her current tote was fine but showing wear.  This Namasta tote was perfect for her.  And I am so glad to see it getting used - it is a beautiful tote and it was a shame for it to sit idle in my den.The coming year feels better with each day!  I am encouraged.They say an apple a day keeps the doctor away.I wonder how many apples I can force my mom to eat in a day :-) .Side Note:  That day when all the world looked good to me, my visit to the yarn shop was successful, and I had my grand dogs babies in the back of my car coming for a visit ... that day ...  as I was pulling into my parking lot - my daughter came out the door with a worried look on her face.  You know you are in trouble when your adult child (substitute caregiver for my mom) meets you outside with a serious look.While I was gone, mom had thrown up twice.  Coming in I could tell mom was not feeling well and the un-said message we were all trying to avoid (the \"elephant in the room\" as the saying goes) was - are we heading into another hospitalization.  Well I am glad to report all turned out well (for a change).  Mom's post nasal drip had become excessive that afternoon - and what she appeared to be vomiting was lots and lots of mucous (I mean serious amounts - without getting to graphic.)  Her vital signs were normal and she had just finished a long course of antibiotics.  So I decided she was well - willed her to be well - demanded of the fates that she be well (hoping desperately I was right).  I told her she wasn't sick, and in an hour or so I would feed her.  If she kept it down, she was fine. If not, maybe she wasn't fine.  But we wouldn't jump to any conclusions (even though we all were jumping to conclusions).  Thankfully I was right.  She was fine.  We all slept in our own beds that night!  The black karma that had been following us since the end of November was pushed aside by pure force of will on my part, and we are moving forward. Period.  The End.  As of January 2, 2011 - all are healthy."},

Some things went well and some things went poorly.  Enough said on that topic!In years past I made lists of goals.  Even then I avoided calling them \"Resolutions\".  Resolutions seem so confining, so serious, so much like a vow or something.  My goals were typically related to my current passions - knitting or walking. They were specific, detailed and numerous.  I had lists of projects I planned to complete: names of patterns, specific yarn, specific colors.  There were usually 12 to 15 goals.  I'd start with 30 and then cut them down.  I never completed all my goals.This year I have \"hopes\".   I see hopes as a step down from goals - and goals are a step down from Resolutions!   Hmm ... a \"stepping down\" pattern here.I hope to have good health for me and my family.I hope to have more time with my husband - just him and me. I think we lost that this year.I hope to spend more time on my hobbies and less time sitting in hospitals and rehab centers.  I did that 3 times this year.  I am pretty sure mom feels the same way too.I hope to walk more.I hope for world peace.  Ok, that was a bit ambitious, but what the heck.  While I am hoping, I may as well stick in something that would benefit others - you know, just in case there is a Genie reading this and granting wishes.  I'd hate to miss a golden opportunity because I wasn't inclusive enough. :-) And I hope that 2011 is kind to everyone.I will work towards these \"hopes\" this year.  And maybe if 2011 is kind to me, I will have more energy for stepping back up to \"goals\" in December 2011.  See ya' in 2011!"},
{"title": "Yea for being female", "date": "Thursday, December 30, 2010", "text": "Birds of all descriptions are streaming to my feeders.  We had a brush of snow, and although it wasn't the feet of snow that fell within 100 miles of us, it was enough snow to trigger the feeding frenzy at the feeders.  The large feeder usually has seed but frequently my smaller feeder is empty when I greet the morning. I see the birds sitting on the bare tree limbs just off my back deck ... waiting, facing towards my glass slider, waiting, watching, wondering ... when is the \"free lunch\" arriving.  I seem to have a large flock of Cardinals in my back yard.  It is not uncommon to see 8 to 10 Cardinals.  Most people love the look of the male Cardinals.  They are brilliant red, showy and a bit cocky if you ask me.  The eye is naturally drawn to them.  Their color makes them very obvious against the winter shrubbery.  I actually prefer to watch the female Cardinals.  They are harder to spot because they are not so bright in their colors.They seem more polite, waiting their turn to feed.  Their feather colors are muted - bright red beaks and touches of red on their wings and heads, but their bodies tend to have shades of color. They are a very appealing bird if you really look at them.  The males are all the same - just red, red, and more red.  The eye is naturally drawn to such strong colors, but the females are more artistically interesting if you take the time to notice.And a day or so ago I saw two Blue Jays.  They are beautiful birds as well, large in size and brilliant blue.  But they, too, all look the same to my eye.  When you have seen one, you have seen them all.Only the female Cardinals are distinctive.Yea, for being female."},
{"title": "Christmas Day - I win the prize for \"Different\"", "date": "Wednesday, December 29, 2010", "text": "(Posted on December 29, 2010)Christmas Day 2010Our Christmas Day couldn't have been more different.  Usually we pack up and travel to my sister's house in Northern Virginia for a magnificent meal, wonderful decorations, time by her beautiful fire place with family and all in the peaceful setting of rural Virginia.  Not this year!  Mom and I weren't leaving our house.  We were gone so long in December that our need to just stay put was overwhelming.Our day began with a pancake and bacon breakfast.   I made Edna Mae's Sour Cream Pancakes from the book:  The Pioneer Woman Cooks - Recipes from an Accidental Country Girl, by Ree Drummond.  Her story is a  fascinating one:  a city girl who marries a \"cowboy\", moves to the country and becomes, well, a Pioneer Woman.  She has an award winning blog that can be found at: http://thepioneerwoman.com/. Her blog show cases the breathtaking photos of her life, her family, her land, the horses and pets, the ranch hands, just anything that catches her eye.  Many of those photos are works of art. She documents her life on a ranch and has an extensive offering of tasty and stick-to-your-bones recipes complete with pictures and personal commentary.   She cooks great! The recipe book is an outgrowth of her blog.  Even if you don't like to cook (and I don't) you will enjoy her blog on many levels.After breakfast we lounged around the house in our PJs digesting our hearty breakfast.  Our pull out couch was filled with people and dogs all morning.  We ate and drank whatever we wanted (although Cheez-Its were a favorite snack).  At 11:00 am I decided to rest for a short time, with my pillow on the floor and a blanket, and at some point I woke up.  One of those unpredictable naps again. Around noon my daughter decided to put her new Dyson vacuum together and test it out on my floors.  Now this is my idea of the perfect Christmas.  Someone vacuuming my house voluntarily without payment.  (Please don't pay attention to how full the Dyson vacuum canister is - there was no time for cleaning, so my house was dirty as well as unprepared.)At 1:30 pm,  we packed up and made ourselves presentable.  The bed was folded up. At 2:30 pm my son and his girl friend headed for her parents house for Christmas dinner. Matt's dogs stayed with us.  We never had a Christmas morning like that.  It was grand. I could get used to that.  Then it got a bit crazy.Around 4: 30 pm my sister arrived and she was not by herself.  She had her husband, her two daughters, their new lab puppy, Morgan and an Italian Greyhound called Fig - my niece was dog-sitting Fig for a friend for the holiday.So,  if anyone is keeping count, we had 5 dogs.  Milo and Morgan were playing hard.   Meathead and Grimace were trying to stay involved but really not able to keep up - they haven't been puppies for a long, long time!!        And Fig?  Well Fig (as you can see from the picture) didn't really care to get involved.  The 4 boys tried to involve her, but it usually resulted in barking and snarling from Fig.  She was happy to sit with my niece in her holiday outfit. And before you get too involved in what she is wearing, it is only a partial outfit.  Under her Santa jacket she is wearing a pink undershirt.  Fig had matching leg warmers and booties - not shown.  Apparently she has many outfits and needs them because (if you didn't notice) she is extremely thin - normal for her breed I am sure, but no body fat and little hair, and as a result, gets cold really easy. She seemed like a pretty nice dog.  I felt a bit sorry for her - strange people, strange dogs, strange houses.  Whatever could she be thinking.  But my niece took really good care of her and Fig stuck pretty close to my niece.Needless to say, after about an hour of dog mayhem, we isolated a few in the kitchen with me.  Once 2 were separated from the group, relative peace ensued. Finally people could visit and exchange presents.  It was almost normal for about an hour.  :-)At 6:30 pm my sister and her entourage departed - onward to visit my brother-in-law's family.  We had our meal from Harris Teeter - Prime Rib, mashed potatoes, green bean casserole and cornbread stuffing. I added a tossed salad, some spinach and rolls.  It was pretty good. We did find the Prime Rib fatty.  We aren't used to high fat foods.  But the big advantage was that I didn't cook - just reheated.  Christmas Day ended with me taking Meathead and Grimace home around 10:30 pm.  And then when I got home into bed for me for another full night's sleep.  So that was my Christmas Day - 2010. The whole month was an Out-of-Body experience - to be honest.  I enjoyed the last few days, but the rest of the month - well, I am very glad to be past it.Onward ... welcome 2011."},
{"title": "Time stops for no one - December 24th", "date": "Tuesday, December 28, 2010", "text": "(Posted December 28, 2010)If I could stop the clock just once in my life ... this Christmas Eve would have been the day.  When I awoke on Christmas Eve I felt refreshed and energized.  I was sure that I could make up for the 24 days I missed.  I was ready to make a massive Christmas Eve dinner, make my once-a-year Christmas Chocolate Chip cookies for my husband (I hate cooking so he gets them only once a year), unwrap the gifts I wrapped yesterday in ugly paper, and rewrap them in beautiful holiday paper, matching bows and artful name tags ... and then, like sand in an hour glass, all that energy slipped away.  I found myself thinking about a nap.My son arrived around noon.  It was so wonderful to see him at home rather than at a medical facility.  He brought my two grand dogs, Meathead and Grimace.  I greatly missed all three of my grand dogs.  I see those mutts normally several times a week - something I almost entirely missed in December.  Once we had 3 dogs in the house, we had the normal confusion and craziness that these 3 dogs together bring.  Our plans for this Christmas Eve had included hosting a dinner for son's girlfriend and her family.  While I was in rehab with mom, her family delivered a beautiful Christmas evergreen table piece and a tasty chicken dish.  We were so touched by their generous gift.  Unfortunately we were forced to postpone the Christmas Eve dinner when I realized that mom might not be home for Christmas.  If she was home, our ability to put together a dinner for 12 people was probably over ambitious.  We are looking forward to seeing them in January ... sort of a winter celebration rather than a Christmas one.  As I was thinking about that nap on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, I realized that postponing that dinner, while disappointing, was probably my only choice.My daughter made the yearly Chocolate Chip Cookies.  They were yummy.  I made Shells and Meatballs with tomato sauce for our dinner.  Simple and fast.  It was good - not fancy but definitely better than 85% of what had sustained me in December.We opened our presents after dinner.  Since the kids hit their teens, we open our gifts on Christmas Eve. It is grand to have our \"kids\" with us on Christmas Eve.  I know that in the future our holiday traditions will change as the demands on their time change, but for now, it was really good.My son decided to spend the night and his girl friend came around 10:30 pm to spend the night with us as well.  Our living room became a big sleep over with 3 people and 3 dogs.  It was a happy and cozy way to close out our Christmas Eve.  As much as I want more time on Christmas Eve, the time we had was great."},
{"title": "The run up to Christmas ... December 23rd", "date": "Monday, December 27, 2010", "text": "(Posted on December 27, 2010)Have you ever had dreams - nightmares really - about not being prepared for a big social event you are hosting, or did not study for a final exam you must pass, or how about ... opening night of a play your are in - and not knowing the lines of your character, or the best one of all ... it is Christmas Eve and you have done almost nothing??  Maybe I am sharing too much of my personal paranoia but I dreamed them all - one of them was a reality for me this month.Mom was released from rehab on December 23 - when we walked in the house, it was like walking into a time capsule with the date December 1 and I have 24 glorious days to get ready.  In reality, I had 24 hours to get ready. But time to  stop dilly-dallying and get cracking ...Number 1 - Get mom into the house, settled and fed.  Check!  Some of you may know that we have 20 steps from the parking lot level to the first floor of our town house.  Those steps were the focus of mom's rehab.  Once in our house she has a chair lift to the bedroom level.  Steps 16 through 20 were a bit of a struggle for her, but in true-grit fashion, she made it.  Yea mom.Number 2 - Wrap the presents I had managed to purchase previously.  Check! Now the Christmas paper wasn't pretty, there were no matching bows (actually there was no ribbon at all) and I didn't have name tags so I took a big old fat magic marker and wrote the names right on the wrapping paper.  Am I classy or what!!!  :-)Number 3 - Call two of mom's doctors because some of her medications had been dropped/switched at the hospital and in rehab, and I didn't know that until discharge from rehab.  Important medicines - like ones to prevent a stroke, or to keep her blood pressure normal or to help with her short term memory loss.  You can bet I wasn't feeling very Christmas-y at that point!Number 4 - Run to the store and get more wrapping paper!!  *sigh*Number 5 - Write checks to cover the gifts not purchased - everyone says they love money - this year they got a chance to prove it.  Check!Number 6 - Make dinner.  My daughter was coming home that evening and volunteered to buy a take-out dinner, but after eating out for several weeks (eating at the hospital cafeteria can put you off food for a long, long time), I was happy to have a home cooked meal - even if I had to make it myself. Check!Number 7 - Get the Christmas Tree up.  Our tree is usually filled to the brim with a life time of meaningful ornaments.  This year?  Get the tree up, lights on, enough ornaments to be legal and call it done. Check, Check and Check!!Number 8 - Throw some holiday cheer on mom.  She looks good in red don't you think. Check!And if you are wondering why she is looking like an Eskimo in my house ... mom runs cold all the time.  Even in rehab, where I considered stripping down to my underwear to keep from sweating, she was cold.  Be assured, I didn't strip - these people were all pretty old and I had no intention of creating havoc - besides, it isn't a pretty sight anyway.Number 9 - Take Milo's picture on his first Christmas.  Check! Now you need to know that this picture was taken just prior to a major melt down between my two cats who LOVE the Christmas tree.  Milo considers everything on the first floor HIS and wasn't interested in sharing!!  Christmas spirit was once again missing for a bit.  Eventually things settled down - Milo got his way. But someday that dear dog will get a claw in his nose.  Glad it wasn't on Christmas!  A trip to the emergency vet, while totally in keeping with how my December had gone, would have made us pretty sad.Number 10 - Go to bed.  A bomb could have gone off and I would have missed it.  Mom slept great too.  Check and Check!Once again my daughter was there to help keep things moving along. When I got up the next morning, I had received my first present - a full night's sleep.   More tomorrow on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day - both filled with fun and unexpected mayhem and  joys."},

I'll post more about the unexpected nature of our holiday tomorrow.  Needless to say, we have much to be thankful for this year.Thankfully Mom and I survived the \"storm\" that was our December.  Mom is doing well.  She sleeps now until 9:00 am and is coming downstairs for all her meals.  I think she is catching up on her rest.  Tomorrow we start in earnest the regular exercises that she was given while in rehab. And sometime this week Physcial Therapy will start again at home.I have slept exceedingly well for 3 nights in a row!!!  (Three whole nights - that is huge!!! )  I haven't been able to do that since November.  However, I begin my mornings with a feeling that my energy levels are normal - and then by noon or so, I am fatigued again.  I am guessing that 3 nights of sleep doesn't make up for missing about 3 weeks of sleep.  :-)   Regardless, it is wonderful to feel rested at least part of the day.  While I was with mom in the hospital and rehab, I never felt rested.  It is a terrible feeling.Today I decided to go for a walk.  I knew it would be hard, but a snow storm was coming and I wanted to get out before it came.  And it was hard!  I was tired about 10 minutes into the walk.  And the walk wasn't refreshing or invigorating like it was several weeks ago - when I got to walk exactly once.  But I pushed myself to complete 30 minutes and according to my pedometer I walked about 1.5 miles.  And then I came home and promptly laid on the couch. Pathetic. But it is a start.  And here I am at 9:30 pm in the evening and I am still awake. Good sign!Hope every one's holiday was joyful.  I'll be sharing ours with pictures tomorrow.  You can't even begin to know what a mayhem it was!!  Check in tomorrow."},
{"title": "Reflection - Losses and gains", "date": "Thursday, December 23, 2010", "text": "Reflection on the last 4 weeks ... Gained - a deeper understanding of aging.  I spent a week living with the oldest of the old. Most Brooke Grove residents in our wing were 80 to 100.  They were friendly and those who could communicate were eager to talk with a new person. Not until you spend days with them, and share meals, or hear about their lives, can you really get a glimpse - just a glimpse - of what it must be like to become very old.  One beautiful woman in her 90s summed it up eloquently.  \"Life just stops.\"  I'll call her Glory.  When Glory came to live in Brooke Grove she could walk with a walker, and when she fell she became wheel chair bound.  Because of her limitations she misses all the family events she once attended.  Yes, they visit, and Glory lives in a beautiful facility, and her room was filled with presents, but she can no longer be with her family on the actual holidays. She can only see those who choose to visit. Glory knows she cannot live independently and her family cannot manage her needs.  She admitted it hurts and there are nights when she cries.  Although life has stopped for her, she always had a smile on her face, she always greeted mom and I warmly, and she always treated her resident \"friends\" gently and with a shared understanding. And though there is continued hurt from the lost of her precious family holidays, there is no bitterness. Hers was one story.  There were others.  There can be great sadness in growing older - that I knew - and great loss as well.  I hope I can continue to spare mom some of that as she continues to age. I take it a day at a time.Lost (temporarily I hope) the ability to sleep through the night. Since mom got sick on November 28, I have been unable to sleep well.  I have had exactly one night's full sleep.  I really hope that once she is home and things settle down - sleep returns.  Gained a new desire to live healthy.This month I pretty much sat alot, worried excessively, ate terribly (when I could eat), slept little, and watched with sadness my mother deal with the consequences of not being more active in her senior years. As the daughter who received her mother's genetic \"cookie cutter\" imprint, I know I am staring at my future if I don't get serious about being more healthy.Lost the need to participate in the \"season\" I literally lost the month of December.  Of all the months in the year, this one is the hardest to lose.  The self-imposed demands of the holiday season - the tree, the greeting cards, the gift buying, the package wrapping, the entertaining - all with the deadline of Christmas Day ... all are eliminated when you are sitting on December 23 - and your focus is just somewhere else.Mom comes home today.  Hopefully I can get the tree up (with my daughter's help) for her this afternoon.  If it wasn't for mom, I would just ignore the whole holiday event - hand out my gifts unwrapped and call it done!  But she deserves a Christmas.  So we will squeeze in whatever we can.  I will be very happy to see January 2011.Gained a better understanding mom's needs.I have always struggled with mom's inabilities to hear, to remember, to stay active, to remain engaged in life.  I wanted more for her. I looked at this aging process only through my eyes.  This past week - I saw it through her eyes and the eyes of others living out their later years.  The needs of older senior citizens are different.  I gained awareness that what looks like idleness often isn't - thinking is slower, decisions take time, mental stimulation is good but not needed at the same level as when younger. And above all - patience is needed by those around them.  Patience is hard when you live with an elderly person day to day, but I watched the \"pros\" do it for the Brooke Grove residents.  I can do better - that much I know.Gained a new appreciation for being home.If I never see the inside of my local hospital again, I will be a happy person.  So much time spent outside my home has made me very, very appreciative of being home.  It is true that absence makes the heart grow fonder.So on balance, I think I gained more than I lost.  It would be naive to assume that another health crisis, hospitalization, or rehab - is not in my future.  For mom at 84 years old, I know that as each day passes, the odds go up that we will travel this path again.  Meanwhile we will add healthier habits to both our lives and savor the fact we survived the storm this December.Today is a day to celebrate. Mom comes home.Happy Holidays to all."},
{"title": "At \"home\" in rehab", "date": "Wednesday, December 22, 2010", "text": "So here are some views of my \"home\" ... mine and mom's, for the last week.  Brooke Grove Rehab and Skilled Nursing is located in Sandy Spring, Maryland.  It really has been a wonderful place to have a loved one.  Mom wasn't happy to be there, but I can tell you that she has nothing to compare it to - and I do.  She got very lucky.Here is a view of the lobby.  You can't see it in this shot, but on one of the chairs facing the fire place a resident cat sleeps.  Do cats know where to sit or what!!This is the Nurses Station decorated for the holidays.  As you can see, the staff doesn't really \"hang out\" there.  They are spread out in one of three wings that span out from this station.  Rarely did I see more than one or two people there.  They are busy with the residents.For the season, they are frequently decked out in red and green holiday stuff, pins, beads, Santa Hats, holiday scrubs, red antlers ... too funny really.  The first time I visited all the staff had red antlers on their heads.In addition, I never once heard a resident addressed in anger or frustration.  They were always treated with respect, patience and love.  I also never smelled anything - never!  The residents are always clean and well cared for.Here is mom checking the news paper while sitting in her wheel chair in the dining room.  Out the window in front of her is a large beautiful gazebo.This is a side view of the building and back yard.  This building sits in the middle of about 250 acres. There is a long drive way (probably 3/4 of a mile or so) through a span of woods and the rehab complex is located deep within the community.  There are areas that have independent living cottages, and I was told they have Assisted Living and an Alzheimer's Unit, but I never saw those buildings.And finally a shot of the resident cat - heating herself by the fire.  They had 2 resident dogs and a bunch of birds. I know that several of the residents have personal pets.  Visitor dogs were also welcome, and Milo and Morgan were there one day together ... drawing the staff into mom's room ... many finding professional excuses to visit room 121, and some just coming in with no excuse to see the dogs.A very relaxed facility, but well run."},

{"title": "That which does not kill you ...", "date": "Monday, December 20, 2010", "text": "... Makes you stronger.Truer words were never spoken.I sit in mom's private room at Brooke Grove Rehab and Skilled Nursing in Sandy Spring, Maryland, pondering the course of events that brought mom and I to this place.First let me say that Brooke Grove Rehab is a beautiful facility filled with competent and caring professionals.  When I realized that mom couldn't come home from the hospital I was in a panic about where she could go to get her strength back.  Nursing home and rehab facilities are not all equal.  One that I saw was a nightmare.  My daughter came to my rescue and suggested this lovely facility.  Throughout this whole journey filled with hospitals, rehab, worry, and fatigue, I have had been most fortunate to have the right people helping me when I needed it most.  My daughter's knowledge of assisted living and rehab, and this facility in particular, was an example of that. My son's frequent visits to see his grandmother, and his \"first sleep over\" with his grandmother when she went into rehab was another example. My children literately kept me from falling several times during the last month.This posting is a long one.  I have been gone awhile - much to share.  So if you are unable to keep reading - I understand.  Check in with me later when my life returns to some level of normalcy.It all began with my illness after Thanksgiving told in my posting \"Return from the Brink\".  Apparently we didn't actually return - I think we fell into the brink but I didn't know it at the time.I was beginning to get well, when my mother got what I had - that terrible vomiting and diarrhea virus.  She was hospitalized within 4 hours of getting sick.  All that was covered in a previous post.  When she was discharged, I thought she was on the mend, when she got sick again.We returned to the hospital - thinking she had a bladder infection -something simple carried over from the first hospitalization.  Turns out it was a bladder infection, but she was also septic - an infection in her blood stream.  This condition was quite a bit more serious than just a stomach flu.  She spent time in the ER, then transferred to a regular nursing area, then had problems breathing. Once that condition was controlled, she was transferred to ICU - Intensive Care Unit, where she spent a day and a half. While there she developed some abnormal heart rhythms which they got quickly under control.  Finally all conditions were improving enough for her to be transferred to a Telemetry Unit - a nursing unit that could monitor her heart.  All that happened in 4 days.  Four different beds in 4 days. I have seen way too much of that hospital.On December 15th, she was transferred to Brooke Grove Rehab.  She is well now, but her strength was seriously sapped by 2 back to back hospitalizations.  And that is where we are now.Our most pressing problem now are her spirits.  She gets down - wanting to go home.  She fails to see how much progress she has made.  She seems oblivious to the beautiful facility, the caring staff and how lucky she has been to have her family with her every step of the way.  This morning I had a serious conversation with her.  I pointed out all the good things she seems to overlook. I even pointed out that many of the people she shares her meals with ... call this place \"home\".  She does not.  She is going to her home ... home with me.  She is the lucky one!  She said she didn't feel lucky.  And I got very serious with her.  She needs to change her mind - and I went over it all again - just how lucky she is.  I think the conversation did her good.  Unfortunately she finds it easier to focus on the negatives, rather than the positives. Human nature, I guess.  But I don't accept that line of thinking.  She will change her mind ... if only to keep me from preaching at her :-).It now time for the \"tough love\" part of her care giving. The time for self-pity is over.  The time for hard work and taking care of yourself begins.  (Good advice for me as well - in January I am going back to Curves! You heard it here first !!!)I don't consider myself a religious person.  But I do believe in God.  And over the last few weeks I have found myself thanking God for giving me the strength to keep going, and for giving me the right help, at the right time, by the right people.  I do feel that even when I felt my most alone and tired and scared ... I really I wasn't alone. I have to remember that even when things are going well - not just when they are going badly.Last night I had my first full and uninterrupted night sleep since the end of November.  I am along way from being totally back on my feet, but getting 8 hours of continuous sleep did help.The focus now is getting mom stronger and maybe, just maybe, getting her home for Christmas.  When she comes home there won't be even one holiday decoration up, no Christmas tree, the presents aren't wrapped, holiday greetings haven't been sent, there are no Christmas cookies baked,  and our holiday dinner will be cooked by the local grocery store ... sounds dismal, but if mom gets home for Christmas, it will be the best Christmas ever for me.If she doesn't get home, then we will have Christmas here at Brooke Grove - all the family as well as my son's 2 dogs (Meathead and Grimace), my daughter's dog (Milo), and my sister's new puppy (Morgan).  Believe me when I say, Brooke Grove Rehab won't know what hit them!!  LOL. And our Christmas dinner will be cooked by the wonderful cooks here at the center.More later.  I have my lap top with me now.  And Brooke Grove has WiFi.Note: I have pictures, and my camera, but left my camera cable at home.  Pictures will follow!!"},

She rested briefly in the kitchen watching the birds out my back slider.  She visited with Milo (well, mostly Milo wanted her crackers).  And then she sat in her normal chair in the living room and fell asleep.  She said she was so tired, but she was happy to be up and walking around.I recognized that feeling.  I expressed the same emotion yesterday when I got outside for a walk."},
{"title": "Break Out Winter Walk", "date": "Wednesday, December 8, 2010", "text": "Oh my goodness, I took a walk today and it was glorious!!Cold, windy, sunny, and totally by myself for 25 glorious minutes - breathing in the cold, clean winter air.  That walk was good for my soul!I haven't worn my pedometer since I clocked a whole 181 steps on the day I was most ill.  It was too depressing to see that total so I took my pedometer off.  I think tomorrow I will put it back on.I thought the picture above was very telling of the season. Although it is not technically winter - this picture says \"Winter Shadows\" to me - trees without any leaves, me bundled up in my long, puffy dog walking coat ... a coat that is so warm I don't need to wear layers underneath.  My shadow makes me look about seven feet tall!There was no specific walking route today. I walked where it suited my fancy.  I wanted to stay close to home in case I petered out.  I passed by an open ball field, and I noticed a man with his two big dogs.  One was a full size white poodle and one was a lab mix. The man was surrounded by about 6 orange retriever dummies.The white poodle was sunning himself by his owner.  Didn't look to me like running was his thing.  The lab was running back and forth joyfully retrieving the dummy every time it was thrown. He couldn't wait for it to be thrown again, couldn't get to it fast enough or return quick enough so it could be thrown again.   I had to laugh.  It appeared that these two dogs were doing what each does best.I walked through that ball park, and as I got to the other end I turned to look at the dogs again.  Apparently I made some false assumptions about these dogs.  Now the lab as laying down enjoying the sun and the poodle was going through his paces.  I stopped again to watch. I noticed that the poodle was inclined to do things in his own time.  He was at the far end of the field looking around for the dummy (It was orange and clearly visible even from where I was), and then he stopped looking and took a pee (when Nature calls you have to respond), and then he found the dummy, and then started back, but half way to his owner dropped it - and took a dump (Nature again ?? ... or another delaying tactic ?? :-) ), and then, eventually, he picked up the dummy and returned to his owner who stood quietly.  There was no calling, gesturing, or encouraging from the man - just stillness, waiting quietly for the poodle to finally return.  And when the poodle did return, he came up to the left of his owner and sat.  Both dogs did the same thing, but each had his own style.  Too funny!I felt like laughing out loud!  Joy at finally getting out for a walk, breathing the cold winter air, enjoyment at watching two well trained dogs go through their paces and watching how each dog marched to his own drum.And mega joy at being free to just enjoy this beautiful day by myself - even if only for 25 minutes. I went back to the house refreshed.Yes, walking is good for the soul.However, this evening I feel like I was it by a truck!!  Boy I am tired.  Getting my energy back is going to be a challenge.  But it was worth it.  Great walk!Update family:  All are well and normal again.   Update mom:  She is well but still weak.  PT started today.  I posted her daily to-dos on her den door.   She is reminded (and I am reminded) of what she has to do each day with regard to exercises and goals. (I guess being a former teacher never goes away.) Last night  she was unable to sleep - I am guessing the anticipation of a nurse coming at 8:00 am this morning kept her up, and she had some diarrhea (due to the dinner I gave her - still too early for her to have breaded fish by Gordon's - my fault. Note to self:  Don't make your mother sick twice in the same month!!) But regardless, she is making progress each day.Update me:  Well, although I can eat anything I want and do anything I want, I run out of energy pretty fast.  I think that is because I wasn't recovered from my own illness when mom got sick. But I am a normally healthy person and that should improve as well with every day that passes.  In fact, I plan to go out for a walk this afternoon.  It will be a short walk, because I have been off exercise AGAIN - and I am still building up my endurance, but I will be walking today. Thank you to those who have being sending email messages of inquiry and encouragement. Everyday I hear from someone else.  Thank you to my son, his girl friend, Meathead and Grimace for sending the Get Well card to his Grandmother. That card made her day!! Thank you to my sister for bringing mom flowers.  Those flowers made the cats day!! :-)"},
{"title": "Return from the brink!", "date": "Sunday, December 5, 2010", "text": "Well, I've been gone a bit - but not sitting idle.  Not idle at all.Just as I was beginning to feel like I might not die, and just after having the first full night sleep in 3 days, and just as I was taking off my lucky socks - so I could wash them ... my mom got the same stomach-flu-crud I had.  At 84 years of age, this virus was especially cruel to her.  Within 4 hours of becoming ill, I had her rushed to the ER by ambulance.  She had fainted from the virulent nature of this virus.She spent 4 days in the hospital and was discharge Friday night. Now - Sunday night - she is still very weak and has no appetite.  But she is eating somewhat regularly and today we started getting her to walk around the top floor of our town home.  Physical Therapy starts next week.Mom and I were not the only causalities.  My husband started getting sick while mom and I  were on our way to the ER.  That night I stopped by home to see how he was.  He said that he had passed out as well, in the bathroom.  He was very lucky to have not hit his head.  No one else was here for him.  My dear daughter who stayed an extra day to help out while I was confined to bed, was \"rewarded\" by getting this virus as well. My sister, brother-in-law, and niece also got very sick.  Since coming home I have been cleaning and cloroxing everything. I know it doesn't really make that much difference, but it makes me feel better to know it is clean.  Mom's rooms and bathroom looked like a war zone when we got home on Friday night - we had no time to clean up or pick up once the EMT's arrived on Tuesday morning so the space felt filled with sickness.  I spent alot of time cleaning the house, but focused on her spaces - stripping the bedding, steam cleaning the carpet, wiping all the surfaces down, cloroxing her bathroom.  I sincerely wish that I could just open my windows for about 2 hours to air the house out.  Not happening at 32 degrees outside, but if I was the only person here - I would open the windows and just wear my coat for awhile.  So now it is a race toward Christmas.  I have lost a week of preparation.  Maybe this is just God's way of slowing me down, pointing out that I don't need to do all the little holiday details to have a happy holiday. I am not being critical, of course, but he could have taken a less dramatic way of getting the message to me. Being pretty hard-headed, maybe a message just short of killing me was required.  I would have preferred, however, that he kept this between me and him - rather than dragging my mother into it. :-)Lots of stuff have fallen off my to-do list this month.  At the top of my list is getting mom back on her feet and strong again.  That would make my holiday joyful.PS - wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands ..."},
{"title": "Wonder Socks and a fabulous daughter", "date": "Monday, November 29, 2010", "text": "Yes, these are wonder socks!  Although a picture can't do them credit, they gave me comfort over this difficult weekend.You see, Friday night a 24-hour stomach virus hit me hard (this one should have been called a \"48-hour and counting virus\" 'cause the impacts are still being felt - that is why I am still wearing these socks.)  You know the kind of virus I am talking about - you and your toilet bowl get to know each other real well, you promise the toilet bowl that you will keep it cleaner in the future, you keep your family up all night long with gagging and toilet flushing sounds, and days later the smell of food still turns your stomach a bit.  That's the one!Somewhere around 3:30 am on Saturday morning, on one of my many trips past my dresser after leaving the bathroom, I realized that my feet were cold (I hadn't been thinking much about my feet, you understand).  Previously I got back into bed feeling sorry for myself and hoping desperately this trip to the bathroom was my last trip ... and then my feet would finally get warm in bed and ... zammo ... off to the bathroom again I went.  On that trip at 3:30 am, I decided to put on a pair of my hand-made wool socks ... I just slipped my hand into the drawer and picked a pair in the dark (I wasn't much interested in being color coordinated at that point).  There was an \"ahhh\" sensation as I slipped the socks onto my feet. Finally there was one part of my body that was being taken care of - my feet.  They were comfortable and warm.  The rest of me wanted to die, but my feet were \"golden\".  And every trip after that (yes, it went on and on *sigh*), I would get back into bed and think, \"oh my feet are so warm and comfortable\" ... it was a small comfort in light of all the other busy things that were going on with the rest of my body - but you take what you can get when you are thinking of just dying!!So here I am on Monday - still eating almost nothing, weak as a piece of limp asparagus, but feeling a bit better, and I am still wearing my same socks.  Now before any of you can make any nasty comments about \"dirty socks,\" let me tell you ... these little gems are broken in just right, my feet have never been cold since I put them on, they are my lucky charm for getting better and they still make me feel good.  They are staying!!And, my daughter is even better than these socks.  She stayed a day later than she intended in a germy house to take care of things.  She ran to the store for me, got dinner on the table for my husband and mom when I could barely lift my head, she did my laundry (checked for spots, checked labels, checked pockets, folded clothes, didn't felt my other hand made socks waiting to be washed ... all done without me giving one instruction!  Wow.)  Thank you, baby!Now, it would be all worthwhile, if tomorrow I got on the scale and found I had lost 40 lbs!!  Ok, that might be a bit excessive.  I'll settle for 35!"},

{"title": "Thanksgiving: past and present", "date": "Thursday, November 25, 2010", "text": "As much as I love Halloween ... if I could have only one holiday a year, it would be Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is about family.All my Thanksgivings of memory have two constants: my mom and my sister.  There were Thanksgivings when I didn't have children or a husband.  And it has been 40 years since I spent a Thanksgiving with my dad who died in 1970. But there have been no Thanksgivings in my memory without my mom and sister. Growing up and as a young married woman I remember having Thanksgiving at my mom's house.  Although we always left the table totally stuffed, looking back and compared to today, I think our Thanksgiving meals were modest. They included the typical turkey and stuffing, mashed potatoes, a vegetable, canned cranberry sauce, and mom's pumpkin pie.  Once I had children I took over the dinner, and I learned to cook a turkey and many of mom's dishes.  My sister and her boyfriend (now husband) would join our table.  My mother-in-law was also with us, and with her came the a tradition of sour kraut and turkey (she said it was a German tradition).  Once my sister married, she and her husband would have two dinners on Thanksgiving day: one with us and one with his family.  They did that for years until they had children and decided to stay home for Thanksgiving.  The Thanksgiving dinner torch was passed to my sister when she had children.   Since then, our dinners have become an adventure in eating.  My sister loves to cook.  No, let me say this differently.  My sister LOVES  to cook.  Mom and I treated this meal as an opportunity to get family together and we fixed the same typical and traditional dishes.  My sister treated this meal as a passion (and she still does).  We have all benefited from that passion.  Besides having the space to serve all the family, she has the pretty dishes, the beautiful pottery, and the adventuresome cooking spirit.  She gets the fresh turkeys from local farmers, and once we even had two turkeys (we did a deep fried turkey one year - incredible), she makes her own rolls and pies, she makes her own cranberry sauce,  she frequently makes two stuffings recipes, and always serves tasty and unusual appetizers ... I could go on, but you wouldn't believe me. But the food is only part of the specialness that is Thanksgiving.  My sister lives in a rural area of Virginia about 60 miles from me.  The last 10 minutes of the trip are the best.  We turn off the main highway onto a gravel road.  This road goes for about 2 miles through a beautiful section of properties, some of which have been there for quite some time.  You real feel like you are in the country. Beautiful land.  You can't see it well in the top picture, but in the distance is Sugarloaf Mountain.  These are two views from her porch.But it would all just be a Martha Stewart moment if it wasn't for our family. It is one of the few times during the year when we get everyone together.  Since our \"children\" are now grown and most are in their 30's, it is beyond incredible that we have maintained that family dinner tradition.  In our culture, it is common for families to go their separate ways, to individually celebrate holidays far from each other, to grow away from the family holiday traditions and the specialness of their relationships.  Thankfully, that has not been our experience.This year Thanksgiving was special for so many reasons.  To begin - my son and his girl friend have been together for years. This Thanksgiving was the first time they came together to share our meal.  She is very much a part of our family - having her there felt right. I suspect we are seeing the beginning of holiday meal sharing between families.  I doubt my son would eat two Thanksgiving dinners in one day.  But sharing is the natural way of things.  We were thrilled she was with us this day.And then there was the grand announcement that my sister and her husband will soon be adopting a lab puppy!  Actually, \"announcement\" isn't quite the right word.  It was more like an unveiling - my brother-in-law turned his computer screen towards me without saying a word, and there was the perfect little face of a chocolate lab puppy.  I was so excited and joyful for them.  The last few years have been very hard - two elderly labs with health problems, many struggles to give them a good quality of life as they aged, and, of course, the final heart break when their lives were over.  The void will now be partially filled with this beautiful new little guy.  You can't ever replace a beloved pet, but you can open your heart to another.  And he doesn't know it yet, but he has landed in a home where pets are family members.  He is a lucky dog.  I am eager to meet him in person.And then the dinner!  Yikes!  My sister out did herself - if that is even possible.  The turkey was 25 pounds - barely fit in her oven.  There were two potato dishes, two stuffing dishes, four or five vegetable dishes, a tossed salad, homemade rolls, two kinds of cranberry sauce (one home made, of course), gravy and mom's pumpkin pie - not to mention the Bourbon soaked dates and Bourbon balls as well as several home made appetizers. There were 10 of us.  She had food for 20.But if you set all that aside (and I mean allllll of it), the real jewel of the day was that I was able to spend yet another Thanksgiving holiday with my sister and my mom.  How many more we have together only God knows.  But we are truly fortunate to have had this wonderful day together.Mom catching a cat nap!"},
{"title": "Late fall walk and a handsome boy!", "date": "Wednesday, November 24, 2010", "text": "This morning I took a regular walk.  The day was beautiful - cool and sunny.  But about half way through the walk, I got to thinking that I had walked all the sidewalks and paths near my house. Without getting into my car and driving out of my neighborhood, there were no unexplored routes.  hmm ...And then I took a side step.Here is my normal path (walked a gazillion times).Here is the hill next to my normal path (walked on ... never).  Here is someone's back yard at the top of that hill (new glorious adventure).Oh well, it was fun to branch out no matter how short the joy was.  I need to find some new walking routes. Glad to have my iPod to keep me company on my walks.  Last night I finished knitting Milo's sweater.  This sweater was made from yarn that was left over from my daughter's sweater and my sweater.  He is one handsome boy, don't you think?I took careful measurements of Milo's body before and during working on this project, but I kept second guessing my sizing.   I couldn't help thinking that the sweater looked too big.  Yikes.  I measured the sweater multiple times and it matched his measurements, but I did hold my breath a bit when he arrived today and I slipped the sweater on him.  Perfect!!Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.  I am so thankful that I have another holiday with my family.  I am thankful that I don't have to travel far to see my family.  I am thankful that my sister loves to cook, that she is a good cook and that I don't have to cook.  I am happy to bring a few dishes and some wine, but I am glad the turkey is at her house and not mine.  Besides my oven is a fire hazard.Yes, I have a self-cleaning oven, but if I turned on that feature now, I would need to open my windows to keep the smoke alarms from going off. One year I turned on the cleaning function of my oven - in January!  Never clean your oven in January!!  I had to turn off the heat, open the windows and sit with my coat on for about 3 hours.  Maybe if I cleaned my oven more frequently than every other year ... I know, 2011 - one of my resolutions will be to clean my oven ... at some point.No sense raising the bar too high. :-)If you are traveling for Thanksgiving, hope your travels are safe.

This week has been an improvement over previous weeks.First and foremost, my grand dog babies .... Meathead, my English Bull Dog grandson, is doing much better.  He finally adjusted to the Phenobarbital.  This has been a great relief to me.  I have been very concerned about how this drug had affected his coordination, balance, and, most importantly, his personality.  All issues seem to have resolved over the course of this week.  We have also reduced his extremely high level of Potassium Bromide.  Now we wait to see how all this plays out with the frequency of his seizures.  So far no seizures.  Welcome back to the world, my dear Meaty.Milo completed his second week of training.  He is such a smart little dog, and he has picked up the initial commands quickly.  The \"leave it\" command has worked pretty well to control his obsession of chewing sticks outside and his jealousy reaction with Meathead.  It is early still, but Meaty's improved mental state and Milo's training seems to be making life a bit calmer here.Milo will share more about his training experiences in the blog he shares with Meaty and Grimace.  It can be found at http://granddogdiaries.blospot.com.Secondly, I have managed some balance with other stuff important to me.I seem to be getting back to my walking routine (again!).  I missed many weeks, but this week I have been taking a 30 minute walk.  Thirty minutes is quite a bit less than I was doing in September, but it is more than I was doing in November.  Since I lost walking endurance, I need to build back up again.  Thirty minutes is enough for now.Although it is still Fall, this picture of trees near my house definitely says Winter.Sadly, I am down to exactly one group Tai Chi session and one knitting group session a week.  But as my energies get pulled into other areas, some things have to shrink so that there is room.  Shrink, yes.  Disappear, no.I was able to get out for lunch with a friend this week (thank you Happy One, it was a great lunch - we need to do that again sometime.) Having lunch with a friend is good for the soul.  Friendships need cultivating.I did set some of my knitting and weaving projects aside this month so that I can complete Milo's sweater.  That project is nearing completion.I've been absent from blogging.  Not a long absence, but not where I want to be. I really want to blog 3 or 4 times a week.  Daily was fun when I first stated, but in my unpredictable life, 3 to 4 times a week is do-able.  Of course, this week was once.  Today.I am still reading, but I am not reporting on every book I read - only the one I think are worth recommending.I can't seem to keep up with the house work - but I am learning to live with that. (Ok, it still does bother me, but I am working on it.) I am, however, focusing on decluttering.  Every time a charity calls looking for a donation of household items - I say \"yes\" even if I don't have anything to donate.  It gives me the incentive to sort through stuff and give it away.  Slowly, very slowly, spaces in the house should start to open up.  Less really is more.  A trite saying but no less true.Finding balance is probably the biggest lesson I am learning this year.  Balance ... a hard lesson for a Type A personality like me to learn. Lots of false starts in the last few months, and I am sure I will have more.  And learning to say \"no\" to things that eat up time that I don't have is something I am practicing.  So although I am \"blog quiet\" at times, I am not off track - just sorting, sorting, sorting all the elements of my life .... and sorting some more.  I am very thankful that I am learning to put perspective on my life."},
{"title": "Hard Week", "date": "Saturday, November 13, 2010", "text": "Well, last week was hard.  It began well enough after the weekend in Philadelphia, but it sort of slipped downward as the week progressed.The main concern has been Meathead, my English Bull Dog grandson.  He is in the third week on Phenobarbital and the drug has been hard on him.  He is very lethargic. (Doesn't this picture just scream LETHARGIC!  Hard to believe, but he likes sleeping like this!)  He also lacks balance and is disorientated.  Because he is so unsteady on his feet, we frequently need to carry him downstairs or lift him out of the car, otherwise he lands on his face.  On slippery surfaces like the kitchen floor his feet just slip out from underneath him, landing him on his stomach.  The best description is that he looks like a severely drunk person.  Sometimes drunk is funny.  But in Meathead's case, it is heartbreaking.When I saw Meaty on Tuesday he was symptomatic, but when I picked him up again on Friday for the weekend he was scary ... zoned out like a zombie ... standing in the middle of my son's living room head bent down. I wanted to cry when I saw him. I don't think he even knew me.  So Saturday I took him to the vet for blood work.  I think the vet was expecting more improvement at week 3.  Even without the lab results she backed down the Phenobarbital.  (For the record - I hate that drug with a passion and nothing I have seen has changed my mind - but I am told it is a highly effective drug for epilepsy.)  We started the new dosage on Sunday morning.  Although Meaty was still very wobbly, his wonderful personality was back on Sunday.  To add complications, Milo was very jealous of the attention Meaty was getting.  It was a struggle to keep peace when the 3 dogs were here. Clearly my dear Milo needs more restraint and training.  But trying to enforce that while managing Meaty issues were impossible.Last week also marked the return of my dear Maxine. Maxine is my 8 year old Maxima.  I really love that car and the dogs have their dog scent all over it.  Of course to get her back in good working order, we had to write a big check!  I know that some would not have spent the money on an 8 year old car, but there have been no problems to this point ... a pretty darn good record, and she has many more miles left in her before I am forced into write a really big check to replace her. That will be a very sad day for me.And today I spent most of my time getting mom to the places she needed to go: lab, bank for her, then bank for me, then store - we did take a moment to get lunch out.  Home now and thought I would post something so that I don't start getting emails (again?) asking where I am.  I am here - treading water.  I need to get back to walking so I can cope better.   The glass of wine while making dinner just isn't enough.  Up side?  Dancing With the Stars is on tonight.  I love escapist TV!!Got to go - the vacuum in calling and the rug steam cleaner needs to be used in a few places!!See ya!!"},
{"title": "What the non-cook cooked!", "date": "Wednesday, November 10, 2010", "text": "Last Friday I cooked!  Not \"big deal\" cooking, but just a few new dishes so that my sister and daughter had something good in the house to eat.  And surprisingly, they turned out pretty good.  I want to share them.The picture is of my kitchen sink after cooking.  Through the window you can see my bird feeder that kept me content while I was cooking. All the recipes can be found at http://www.realsimple.com.  Check out this website.  It is great. The first dish is called Linguine With Squash, Bacon and Goat Cheese.  I discovered this dish one night when I was taking Meathead and Grimace home, and my son's girlfriend was cleaning up from dinner when I walked in.  (She has a wonderfully informative blog at http://mowrite.blogspot.com)  The house smelled wonderful and my son said the dish was yummy!  Graciously she offered me some to take home and graciously I said yes ... like right away before she could change her mind!!  It was to die for!  Yes, you squash-haters out there, this dish is to die for!  You can put bacon and cheese on anything and it is wonderful.  Now you should know that I did tweak the recipe as it was written.  It called for 6 slices of bacon.  Good heavens, I am not opening up a pound of bacon and then using only 6 slices.  Get real!  So I used it all.  I couldn't see myself cooking up only 6 slices, I couldn't see myself just eating the left over bacon while I cooked (bad for my blood cholesterol), but I could see myself eating all the bacon crumbled into the dish smothered in cheese.  Somehow that dairy option made the bacon seem healthier.  :-)  And then there was the issue with the goat cheese.  The recipe called for 4 ounces of soft goat cheese, crumbled.  Well ... goat cheese comes in 3.5 ounce packages.  One half ounce short of what was called for!   So I bought 2 packages (I did wince alittle - it was $6.99 a package.)  When I opened up the packages, I tasted the goat cheese.  Yum - mega yum. But what was I going to do with the extra goat cheese once I used 4 ounces.  I couldn't just eat it - although it was way good - but the cholesterol you know.  So I added to the recipe - all 7 ounces.  See, I figured that it was additional dairy (goat is dairy, right?) - think of all that calcium.  And I beefed up the amount of garlic - who uses only 2 cloves of garlic!!  And garlic is good for the heart balancing out the bacon and the cheese (sort of) and it keeps away vampires.  All good!  I did reduce the pound of linguine to 3/4 of a pound - got to cut calories somewhere!  And the butternut squash - what can I say.  If you don't like butternut squash, you probably have genetic damage.   This recipe was good the first day and every day after.  Some recipes are good at first but don't carry over well.  Not this one.  Yummy every day until it was gone.  Note to my dear cousins - when we see you in December, this is on the menu!The second recipe is called Shrimp With Sausage and Tomatoes.  I didn't tinker with this recipe quite so much.  I did add garlic - because there was an obvious typo in the recipe - they forgot the garlic.  And I omitted the peas.  My husband doesn't like peas. But the title pretty much describes what was in this.  I think the main flavor came from the fire-roasted tomatoes.  It is served over rice.A third recipe I made this weekend was called Spaghetti With Beef Mushroom Sauce.  Sorry, no picture but there is one in the Real Simple web site.  The recipe was pretty simple.  The ingredients were pretty typical for us: ground beef, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, Parmesan cheese - stuff we eat alot of here, but the secret ingredient was 1 cup of heavy cream. I was tasting this recipe as I was making it and thinking all the time ... boring!  And then I added the cream ... what a difference.  Now my husband likes all the things in this recipe, but he didn't like this one so much.  I think the cream was too much for him.  The recipe did say you could lighten  this dish by omitting the cream and doubling the tomatoes.  I don't know about you, but tomatoes can never step in and replace cream.  If I do this recipe again, I might reduce the cream some, but I don't think it would be as good without it.And for the record: I am thankful for that kitchen window!!"},
{"title": "A sister and a daughter", "date": "Tuesday, November 9, 2010", "text": "There are no pictures here.  No wonderful descriptions of magnificent sights.Just a simple recognition that without the help of my sister and my daughter, our day drip to Philadelphia would have been impossible!  The peace of mind I had that mom was OK, that my sister and my daughter were here to take care of any situation that would arise ... well, to quote a commercial ... it is \"priceless\".Now I am not saying that it was a piece of cake for them while I was gone.  They had, in fact, broken out a bottle of  wine in an effort to cope (mom can be a challenge when change is forced on her).  And mom was rather un-gracious when I got home.  After all, I got home at the dreadful hour of 10:00 pm.   And apparently 2 phone calls home to check in that everything was ok was not enough.  \"So, you decided to come home\" was my welcome!  *sigh*  But I knew in my heart that everything was OK, and it was fun to have one day without any cares or concerns.   So what could I be thankful for on this day?  A sister and a daughter."},
{"title": "Road Trip Part Three - the other stuff", "date": "Monday, November 8, 2010", "text": "The trip to Philadelphia was made with friends.  We have traveled with this couple before and it is always fun.  We left at 8:30 am on Saturday morning.  The trip was uneventful, but special for several reasons: I didn't have to drive.  I love it when I don't have to drive.  (And we still didn't have our car - they are promising we should have it Tuesday - almost a week from when I dropped it off the third time for repair).  And our friends drove south from Baltimore to pick us up and then drove north to get to Philadelphia. That was a very generous thing to do.After arriving in Philadelphia, catching lunch and confirming our tickets, we checked out Cleopatra and then the Hubble. Both shows were terrific.  Walking around, I notice they had a walk-through heart.  Pretty cool.  Yes, it was aimed at children, but children come in all sizes and I enjoyed walking through the 4 chambers of the heart and the lungs.They also had a Pendulum Staircase.  That was pretty interesting.  I leaned over the staircase just long enough to catch this picture.  I don't like heights so I was quick.  The  trip home was uneventful as well.  Yes, we used maps and we used GPS - thankfully that was their job.  They did a great job driving and navigating.The day ended with dinner in Columbia. It was a wonderful day.  November 6 - I am thankful that we had the opportunity to see such important historic objects.November 7 - I am thankful that I am a human being.  Human beings are capable of such magnificent things. (Did you see those pictures from Hubble?)  Sometimes we need reminders that we can do great things.November 8 - I am thankful for friends that would ask us to go on this adventure with them, who would go out of their way to pick us up, and who would do all the driving."},
{"title": "Road Trip Part Two - Hubble", "date": "Sunday, November 7, 2010", "text": "(posted Monday, November 8, 2010)Our Saturday road trip was filled with more than just Cleopatra.  The Tuttleman Imax Theater was showing a 40 minute movie called Hubble.This theater had a 4-story domed, wrap-around screen, a steep seating arrangement that tilted you backwards allowing you to see the whole screen.  The seating arrangement felt alittle like sitting on steeply slanted wall and if you leaned forward too much you would topple off the wall.  Of course, that is just me, - height always makes me nervous.  But once the show started, it was easy to forget about the seats.The show started with the announcer giving all kinds of suggestions, cautions, warnings, etc. etc. etc.  One of the announcements said that movie cameras and flash cameras were prohibited.  Hmmm...  And besides - \"your pictures won't turn out anyway\" - pretty much what they said exactly.  Well ... I am sure you can guess that wouldn't deter me.  No flash, but my camera worked just fine, thank you very much!So folks ... welcome to the universe.Here are the Hubble telescope that made these pictures possible.Here is the \"bus\" that got the Hubble up real, real high!!! :-)Here is one of the humans who braved this dangerous trip to help repair the Hubble.This movie pulled out many emotions from me.  I started out feeling immense pride at what man can do when we set our minds to it.  Many people working together to make this possible and succeeding!  Makes you wonder why we can't do smaller things like balance a national budget, or get along without our earthly neighbors without anger and war.  Don't you think we should be able to do those little things if we can do this big thing???  And then when we get just a peek at our universe, those images make you feel small and unimportant.  Even our Hubble is just a tool to show us how little we really know.  We are just a speck.Finally, the question of \"Are we alone in the universe?\" seems to be obvious to me. Of course, we aren't alone.  The expanse of our universe is really beyond our ability to imagine - so there must be life out there somewhere.  PS - My camera did a pretty good job even without a flash.  Of course, it couldn't show the full scope of each picture, but I was centered in the seats so I figured I would capture something if I just kept hitting the button.  I really didn't know what I was getting because the camera was just resting on my stomach while I snapped images.  I was pleased.I love stretching the limitations and breaking the rules."},
{"title": "Road Trip: Part One - Cleopatra", "date": "Saturday, November 6, 2010", "text": "(Posted on Monday, November 8, 2010)On Saturday we took a road trip to see Cleopatra - The Search for the Last Queen of Egypt, a fascinating museum exhibition  currently on display at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, PA.  The exhibition, sponsored by National Geographic, showed the remarkable  treasures discovered during archaeological expeditions of the land and under water locations of the old city of Alexandra and Cleopatra's royal palace.  Unfortunately pictures of the exhibits were prohibited  so I am forced to show pictures from the printed materials provided.  Initial impressions?  Wow, these people had a lot of gold.  It was amazing just how many gold items were on display.  What is remarkable is that the retrieval of these items continues - as well as searching for the burial place of Cleopatra.  The gold on display was just the tip of the iceberg.  It was also interesting to note that images of Cleopatra are not common so getting some idea of what she looked like was not easy.  Apparently after her death, Rome ordered all images of her destroyed.  Guess they didn't care for her too much.  But despite that, some images survived. Most images were on coins, but there were a few sculptures that managed to avoid destruction.  But all images on display from Egypt were different.  Apparently individual artists manipulated her features in a way to reflect the custom of the times - to display their Pharaohs as Gods - so these images didn't give you an idea of how she really looked.  There was one sculpture of her in the Roman style - so her features were probably closer to what she actually looked like. If that image was correct, she was a beautiful woman even by modern standards.Since many of the items on display were buried under sand and water, they were in excellent condition.  It was amazing to see such beautiful items and think that 2,000 years ago these items were used, handled by those who served Cleopatra - maybe by Cleopatra herself.  In fact, there was one piece of papyrus that was written in Cleopatra's own hand - signed by her.  I found that most incredible that such a delicate a piece of papyrus had survived.The trip was an success.  And the Cleopatra exhibition was well worth the trip to Philadelphia.  We saw a few other things while we were there and I will tell about them (with pictures) during another posting.  It was a wonderful day."},
{"title": "Cooking Day and my kitchen window", "date": "Friday, November 5, 2010", "text": "I spent most of the day cooking for company coming tonight and to cover my absence all day tomorrow.My sister and daughter are coming tonight to spend the weekend with my mom.  My husband and I are going to Philadelphia tomorrow with friends to see a museum exhibit on Cleopatra.  It will be a fun day with friends, eating out, and a once-in-a-lifetime (at least my life time) museum exhibit.  But it can't happen without some preparation on my part.  Yes, I did do alittle house cleaning but mostly I needed to cook.  I have house-dog sat at my sister's house in the past. The fun thing about house sitting (or mother sitting like this weekend) is that the sitters can just sit and do whatever they want.  There are no chores and no cooking either.  When you are hungry you just go to the fridge and open to door to wonderful dishes already prepared that just need heating. So I made some meals today - one for tonight and one for tomorrow.  And for those who know me well, cooking is not fun for me.  But today it was different. I did pick new recipes for me - I'll share them next week as they were easy and very tasty.  But what was very special was the company I kept while I cooked.  You see my kitchen window is right over my sink.  I looked out frequently while I was cooking (looking for distractions I guess - and finding it).  I couldn't believe just how busy my bird feeder was.  And the variety of feathered visitors was great!  I had no idea that many different kinds of birds graced my deck.  I was constantly picking up my camera and taking pictures.  Here are a few a the best ones.  And as you can see not all the visitors had feathers.  I am thrilled to see the Blue Jay is back - at least I think he is a Blue Jay.  I included 2 pictures of him: one where he takes center stage all by himself and one where he is sharing the feeder with another bird. I thought the comparison of size was pretty amazing.  Mr. Blue hasn't let such a small perch get in the way of getting at the seed.  I have never seen more than one Blue Jay.  I can't believe he is the only one around.And then there is this little cutie.  I think I can take credit for that round belly.And at one point the feeder was full and other birds were flying around like there was something given out for free.  Oh wait, it was free!!... I couldn't capture all the action.And then there was this little guy who seemed to be waiting his turn at the feeder.  Some visitors had better manners than others.Let us not forget the other guest I usually see.  He is quite a looker! Don't you think?  He seems to be just looking over his shoulder at me.Yes, this afternoon was pretty great having company while I cooked.  And thankfully I have an abundance of great things in my life:Wednesday, November 3 - I am fortunate to live next to a watershed area - a wooded location that is the perfect home for birds.Thursday, November 4 - I am very fortunate to have the company of these beautiful animals - so near my home.Friday, November 5 - I have one pretty great point-and-shoot camera.There.  I think I am caught up there. :-)PS - Sorry I have been gone for a few days.  My car has been in and out of the shop several times this week.  Currently my Maxima is in the shop and has been there for several days.  She is getting older - 2003 - and hasn't really been a problem until now.  And I don't think we are ready to buy another car.  We want our pup-taxi back. It has been a frustrating week trying to balance our planned schedule with inconsistent transportation.  Some stuff just dropped off the calendar, like all the Tai Chi.  I wasn't in the mood.  But I am fortunate that the auto repair shop we deal with has given us a loaner every time, but it is frustration to not have your own vehicle."},
{"title": "Pulling out of a fiber funk!", "date": "Tuesday, November 2, 2010", "text": "This year it seems I took a bit of a hiatus from knitting.  It wasn't planned.  I actually had a very long list of knitting goals back in January 2010 - mostly knitting - because that was what I was into last year.  You see, 2009 was \"The Year of Me\". Everything I planned to make was going to be for me only.  My knitting group friends were also invited to knit things for me (of course, that got a laugh but ... you never know!  :-)  ) In all my prior knitting years, I made stuff for others, but 2009 was going to be about me.  And so I knitted like a mad-woman for the whole year.  Big projects. Sweaters mostly, but other stuff as well.  I even finished a scarf that I started in 2000 - yes, it took 9 years to complete (don't ask). At the end of 2009 I fell apart on the selfishness vow and knitted a hoodie sweater for my daughter.  But other than that, it was me, me, me.This year the \"knitting tsunami\" came to a crashing halt.  I don't know why but I couldn't get enthused to knit much of anything.  I finally made a sweater, that I gave to mom because it was just too warm for me.  And I made a hoodie for me, but it is sitting downstairs waiting for buttons.  In May signed up for a Knit-a-Long on the web site Ravelry. The sweater was one I have looked forward to making, but I am not very far along (pictured above).There were a few spikes of new interests this year, however.   I bought a spinning wheel, but I am waiting for more time with my cousin to help me get my spinning \"legs\".  I have done some spinning on a spindle but that has been sitting idle recently. I am still very interested in spinning, but I haven't got much time or energy right now for such a big new thing. A smaller new thing was weaving on hand looms: the Weave-It loom and the Hazel Rose Looms.  They have been very easy to learn, and very easy to pick up and put down.  They seem to fit very well into the ADD that has been my hobby life this year.I have begun a new project - a sweater for Milo that will match the matching sweaters my daughter and I have.  As far as knitting goes, that is what I am knitting on mostly.  It is getting cold outside so that is my main focus.BUT ... for November 2Despite my distractions this year, I am very, very thankful for these hobbies, for my large stash of yarn and fiber, for the tools I use to support these hobbies, for the friends and family who join me in these wonderful past times, for my knitting group filled with friends who encourage each other weekly. I am so very lucky.My interest in these hobbies is still strong.  The funk that has been 2010 is fading.  I am eager to pick up my needles, my looms, my spinning wheel and spindles ... and I am so grateful for them."},
{"title": "A month to give thanks!", "date": "Monday, November 1, 2010", "text": "November!Now begins the season of holidays: Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years!  Over the years I have tried to simplify this season.  But it would be a shame to lose the specialness of each event between now and January 1, 2011.When I think of November, I think of all the things I am grateful to have in my life.  I am new to blogging, but I have seen several blogs doing something along these lines this year - remembering to be thankful for what you have. I guess I am not original!  But I am glad that people take the time to do this.  We are all so rich in our blessings.November 1st - I am thankful for these 3 happy tails.  They are waiting at the door for me to return from the grocery store.  They love me without reservation!  I think that is a dog-thing!! :-)  Recently Meathead has been much on our minds.  As an epileptic for many years, he has been medicated to control the frequency of the seizures.  But the condition continues to grow in frequency, so last week he was started on a new medication that makes him disoriented and clumsy.  The vet says it may a take a month for the symptoms to subside.  It is hard to watch the seizures, and it is hard to watch his reaction to the new meds.  He is such a dear boy. But hopefully this will make a difference after he adjusts.  I love these 3 little guys very much.  I am so thankful my children shares these wonderful companions with me.And I am thankful for my two cats - Max and Wally.  This picture shows them as kittens in 2006.  Getting them in the same picture now is hard.  They still get along and play well together.  And above all, they get along very well with the dogs - well, they get along very well with Meaty and Grimace.  Once Milo gets older and shows some self-control, I am sure peace will abound.  But these two little guys are very special to me and my husband.  After 42 years of having cats as a part of our lives, we absolutely couldn't do without them.  I have already made my whole family promise that someone MUST adopt any pets we have once we are gone.  And, of course, Max has special needs, just like Meathead.  Max has degenerative kidney disease and we inject fluids under his skin every other day - to help keep him healthy for as long as possible.  His prognosis is a shortened lifespan, but we are grateful for every day we have that charming cat with us."},

It was hard to choose just a few pictures.  It wasn't the largest crowd we have ever had, but all seemed to take great care with their costumes.  Happy Halloween Everyone!And yes, there appears to be a haunted house in my neighborhood.  They have a sign out side and everything.  I walked by this house all month wondering if they planned a haunted open house - like the sign said.  Did they have an actual website?  Is this a string of haunted open houses?  Questions, Questions.So today, on Halloween, I checked the website listed on the sign.  I am so gullible.  When you key in the website address in google, it directs you to a site that sells Halloween stuff - and this sign is one of the things they sell - and they are \"Sold Out\" of the sign. :-)So it appears that this sign is just one of the many decorations for this house.  Pretty darn cute.  A real \"trick\".Doesn't look too haunted to me!"},
{"title": "I love a Marching Band!!", "date": "Saturday, October 30, 2010", "text": "Today I was rewarded big time for walking around 9:30 am.  A marching band was parading right along my walking route!  How great is that!! Hammond High School, the neighborhood high school for our area has a Home Coming Parade every year in mid-October.  This year I figured I had missed it because it was already October 30 - and no parade!  When I started out I could hear the drums in the distance.  I was thrilled.  The football team participates as well.  No marching in step for them.And then there are the cheer leaders.  Guess the little short skirts are too old fashion for them.They take a route through the neighborhood every year.  There are floats and cars with the Home Coming Courts for each class.  They also get a police escort so that traffic can be held up for the passing of the parade.  Since I was on foot, I could see some of the drivers who had to wait.  Some were enjoying the parade.  There were others who seemed annoyed that they had to wait - (the wait was probably only 15 minutes).  But I couldn't help feeling  annoyed with the drivers who weren't enjoying the view.  Here we have a small positive demonstration of the effort and talent of our upcoming generation.  The kids weren't being loud or disruptive.  They weren't causing any damage.  They were celebrating, and sharing their celebration with the neighborhood.  There is just no pleasing some people.  Thankfully there were far more people just like me who were enjoying the parade.It brought back memories because my daughter was in Marching Band when she attended Hammond High School. I have tons of pictures of it and wonderful memories.This is part of my fall as well.  How many people are lucky enough to have a parade march through their neighborhood ... right by their house ... like I do every year for the last 25 years!  I so love a marching band!!"},
{"title": "Frustration - Navel gazing", "date": "Friday, October 29, 2010", "text": "I really seem to make my life more difficult than it needs to be.  The next 20 years shouldn't be more difficult.  When I was a working person, I always set the bar high.  My employers loved me.  People who set the bar high don't need much managing.  Managers love employees who don't need much managing.  Less work for the manager.But I am retired!  No boss.  No job.  No bar setting.  But obviously the old bar-setting behavior is still rampant.For example:  This month has been pretty poor in getting in all my walks.  My average steps per day in October are 7,699 (in September is was about 10,400 per day).  To reach that 10,000 goal between now and October 31st I would need to walk over 34,400 steps per day for 3 days! And when I discovered that fact on Walker Tracker - I immediately thought - \"well, that is possible. I could do that ... just for 3 days ...  I might need alittle Advil, but ... \"   So, let's see raised hands on just how insane I was for that 5 minutes.    Today while I was riding into Bethesda to pick up Milo (a bright spot in my life that I can't do without), while riding in the car (which means I was sitting - not walking - which means no steps *sigh*),  I got to thinking.  I should approach this whole process looking at what I can do, what fits into my life,  ... and stop trying to apply an arbitrary structure - which ends in frustration when I miss the goal.  I really do my best thinking when I am riding into Bethesda.  I am by myself, no radio, no pod casts, no distractions.  Tomorrow I am going to enjoy the 2 hours of peace I have first thing in the morning when I am the only one up - instead of mentally arguing with myself about going for a walk in that time.  I am not a morning person - so sitting quietly with coffee, checking my email, watching the birds, harvesting my crops on \"We Rule\" ... accept the quiet stuff that fills my early mornings and quiets my brain as well.  The walk will come and so will the steps.  But not on a schedule.Make the end of the month a \"discovery\" time - rather than a charge to the finish line.Darn uptight Type A personalities ... why couldn't I have been born a more relaxed Type B. Here is a wonderful news article on our Tai Chi group written by Maureen O'Donnell.  This article was published in a new online local news site called The Columbia Patch.  The link below takes you into that web site.  If you are a local reader, you really need to check out The Columbia Patch.    Thank you Mo, it is a great article and really captures the essence of Tai Chi.She even captured the sound and beauty of our Friday practice site, Centennial Lake.http://columbia.patch.com/articles/tai-chi-chuan-balancing-body-mind-and-emotion"},

I am still striving to walk, to do Tai Chi, to stretch, but I am not breaking it all into little pieces and documenting in a bunch of places.So here is the plan.I will track 2 things - average steps for the month and percentage of steps that are aerobic.  These 2 numbers are easily gotten off of Walker Tracker.  I am going to stop documenting in Map My Run.  Tracking my activity in 3 places is just too hard to maintain. The Tab called Walking Report Card will hold that information.Using Walker Tracker I can convert any other activity into steps so it is a consolidated number - a reflection of everything I am doing - when I report it at the end of the month.I was doing great in September and I am doing not-so-great in October!!Tomorrow is another day!  Onward!  ;-)"},

{"title": "Feathered Visitors", "date": "Sunday, October 24, 2010", "text": "This picture of my two boys, Max and Wally, is pretty typical.  The deck just beyond the slider is where I feed the birds and where the squirrels visit.  And the two cats love to sit quietly and watch.  In case the picture doesn't show it, Max is sitting on the chair above Wally who is on the floor.We are allll bird watchers in this house.And the birds have been fairly quiet this month.  I guess there is plenty for them to eat without my seed.  I haven't even seen much of the squirrels.  That is unusual.  I get the typical typical Wrens and Chickadees - and we have a lot of Cardinals year round.  But the woodpeckers have started to arrive.Left is a Red Bellied Woodpecker (which is what the book says even though it is his head that is red and not his belly).Right is a Downy Woodpecker.  He wants me to go away.I see these two guys all the time.  Several times this summer I saw a Blue Jay.  He was big and beautiful, but recently he has been absent.I am pretty sure the bird population will increase at my feeder as the season changes to winter.  It is a busy feeder come December.This evening all my dog buddies have gone home to their owners.  The house is quiet beyond belief.  We are a pretty quiet bunch - my mom, my husband and I.  Meathead had another seizure this afternoon around 4:00.  It was a short one, but all his seizures seem like hours to me when they are going on.  As hard as they are to watch, I am always grateful I was present.  The thought of him having seizures by himself makes me sad.  It happens, of course, because he frequently is at home alone when my son goes to work. But when he isn't alone, we can give him meds to shorten the seizure and make sure he is OK.  Yesterday I put flannel sheets on all the beds.  And today I heard that we are going to have a warm up for this week.  Figures!!  Think I will go upstairs and switch out my summer clothes for my winter ones.  That should send the temperature gauge into the 90's with my luck.I am also going to do a major clean out of clothing.  A visit to the Good Will truck is on the agenda for tomorrow.  And tomorrow looks like a killer day.  Too many things to accomplish.  Happy Sunday to all."},
{"title": "Dogs and Dumpsters", "date": "Saturday, October 23, 2010", "text": "Today was another dog weekend - a three dog weekend.  It is always alittle like taking care of toddlers at a \"play group\". There is always one little guy in the group with immature social skills, bratty behavior, and interested only in what feels good to him. In our play group that would be Milo.  He is still quite young - only 6 1/2 months, but we are trying to instill some rules like - don't nip at Meathead jowls or Meathead feet.  Don't jump Meathead while he is sleeping.  Don't hump Meathead 'cause that is really bad form.  Eat all your meals and don't beg at the table.  Do not eat sticks and bugs and leaves and bird droppings, or random pieces of bark and tree seed pods.  This is only a partial list of stuff we are working on, of course.  :-)  But when you look into that darling little face, he is hard to resist.For example:  Earlier in the week, Milo was busy chewing on a bone.  Suddenly, (very suddenly - so suddenly that he forgot what he was doing,) ... suddenly, he heard something outside.  He jumped up ran to the window - bone still in the mouth!  How can you resist a face like that?  Grandma, are you laughing at me?  I am protecting \"hearth and home\"!!Anyway, he is \"a work in progress\".  Being cute saves his butt more times than I can count. Actually that is exactly what happened with my 2 children, if I remember correctly. \"Cute\" saved their butts!!I did manage to get some cleaning done and I am in a pitching mood.  No matter where I am in the house, I make an effort to look at stuff and decide if I want it.  Usually it goes in the trash or the charity donation bag.  I suppose I could start in one closet and do a complete clean out, but I can't seem to get focused enough to be that organized.  So I am just randomly looking at stuff and pitching as needed. It is amazing just how much stuff you can have right in front of your eyes, that you don't actually see.  And when you look ... really look, you can't help but wonder why xyz was kept for so long!  Xyz hasn't been touched in years.  Xyz has an expiration date that expired two years ago.  Xyz hasn't been worn for a long time and probably won't fit.  And if xyz did fit, the fashion passed 10 years ago.  Xyz is just adding stress to my life by its very existence.  This weekend our neighborhood association had dumpsters delivered to our street.  These dumpsters were for large things that cannot go with the regular trash pick up.  We got rid of about 6 items.  One was a 10 foot board that was part of my son's bed when he was a child.  The bed has long since gone.  And my son is 37 years old.  This board was just one of those things that had been here in front of our eyes, but we just didn't see it. Now we really can't see it because it is in the dumpster!! :-)  It was a productive day.  Hope your day was just as productive."},
{"title": "The Silly Season", "date": "Friday, October 22, 2010", "text": "We are in the midst of what I traditionally call \"the silly season\".  We have been suffering through the pre-election period that will blessedly be over the beginning of November. Politics is not my favorite subject.  In fact I considered making this a \"soap box\" topic, but my comments in that section are really closed to discussion.  When I want to rant about something, I don't really care for feedback.  Not so with Politics.  I would love to hear others comments on this topic.Where to begin.  I am annoyed and disillusioned by so many aspects of the election process that I don't know how to start.  I should say that I am not a politically astute person. I am not registered with either political party - I am registered Independent because at various times I am frustrated with both parties.  I just cannot align myself with either of them.  I do believe strongly in participating in the voting process.  I don't think that frustration with trappings of the politics should get in the way of casting a vote.  It is the best way to state how you feel about our government's actions and to make a change.  And change still seems to be the mantra of our population.  What drives me absolutely crazy is the terrible waste of resources and the twisted finger pointing and spinning of facts used to get your vote.  For example:The road signs are a total waste of time and money.  They clutter the yards and highways.  They provide no information whatever about the candidate - other than the \"vote for me\" message.  I can't believe that any one's vote is changed because they saw a sign in their neighbor's yard (or 10 signs like some yards have).  The cost of the signs and the man power used to distribute them and clean up is really of no value to educating the voting public.  Candidate materials that show up in your front door and mail box have limited value.  At least they have some of the candidates positions on them.  Robo-calls are the most annoying.  I don't know how much they cost - probably not that much because they are machine generated, but the interruption factor in your home is most intrusive. I hang up as soon as I get one and so no information is imparted through that method in my house.And then there are the TV ads.  Holy cow!  They are expensive beyond measure, repeated until you want to throw a shoe at the TV screen, they are usually filled with slanted content about the opponent that at times is so ugly and exaggerated that you wonder how could someone \"approve this ad\".  There is only one senatorial candidate in our area whose TV ads are reasonable in frequency and focused entirely her record.  I respect that so much that I would vote for her regardless of her views.  Isn't that sad.But to complain without offering a solution is just as bad. I have thought about solutions.  Limit campaigning periods to a set period.  Six weeks should be enough for anyone to get get educated and make up their mind about the issues.   Limit campaign expenditures - everyone should have a fair shot at getting their message out - not just the person with the most money.  If you manage to collect more money than is allowed, the overage could be used to promote ecological issues or provide educational funding for talented individuals - promote positive community efforts in the name of the candidate who contributed the funds.  They get a publicity bonus that counts for something, but they don't get to slam us to the point of insanity with campaign materials, ads, phone calls, TV spots.Require that some funds go to a central independent group for the consolidation and publication of each candidate's position, so that voters who want to be educated about the various candidates can have a single publication - a consolidated position document to review and make decisions about.Require 2 or 3  debates that are open to the public - either in person or through some sort of media (TV, radio, newspaper) something so you can get a sense of the person and how they comport themselves.Allow a \"none of the above\" choice on the ballot. So many people don't vote because they don't support either candidate.  Give people an opportunity to vote and express their frustration with the choices rather than voting against a candidate without really supporting the person they voted for.  I heard that option on my local radio station and I thought it was genius!Just those 5 bullet points would make the process so much more civilized.What do you think?"},

{"title": "A Walk and Chinese Carry Out", "date": "Wednesday, October 20, 2010", "text": "I pushed myself out the door right after breakfast.  And I am very glad I did.  It was overcast and cool.  The sun was out but it was so hazy behind the gray mist.  But it was perfect for walking.As I was coming down the last street of my walk I noticed 3 deer munching away on someone's front yard.  There are two on the right and one on the left behind the bush.  They were so peaceful ... and yet watchful.  They kind of looked like the same deer I saw a few weeks ago.  All 3 young, but 2 were younger than the third.I decided to walk up to them. They watched and then slowly moved away.  I moved forward, and they kept looking back.  Then they slipped around the side of the house away from my view.  So in true stalker fashion I went around the opposite side of the house where there was woods (thank goodness the occupents of the house were at work).  The deer grew in number to about 10 - all young at various ages.  One was a young buck.In these pictures I was pretty far away.  My camera zooms to about 10x (whatever that means) and recently I discovered that if I hold my finger on the zoom again while at 10x, it can zoom in to about 40x. I also know that the pictures were terrible unless I braced against a fence or tree because any movement at that range (movement like the pulse in my fingers, or my breathing) blurs the image.  For a point-and-shoot camera, this one zooms great.This afternoon I went to Tai Chi class - always good for my mood and then we had Chinese carry out for dinner.  And the rest of the time??  I sat on the couch knitting a sweater for Mr. Milo. I am glad that I had today, because tomorrow will be just crazy.  Food shopping first thing in the morning, and CVS for a prescription,  then out to Bethesda to get Milo for the weekend, and because he has a rash on his leg, I will be taking him to the vet as well, and then after that is settled, I need to go get Matt's dogs.  I think I better crank up the crock pot tomorrow morning.Little chance of blogging or a walk on Thursday.Just another crazy Thursday.I feel like I need to whine!  And not the good kind like a tasty Cabernet Sauvignon wine!  This posting is \"self talk\" - a chance to pour out some frustrations with my walking progress this month.  Feel free to check in with me on another day if you can't stand whining.October has been almost a bust with regards to walking.  The most beautiful month of the year, and I am struggling to get out the door. I have missed so many days of walking this month, that it will be next to impossible to break the 10,000 steps per day average mark for October.Now for my excuses (there are no excuses, but I have them anyway):It seems that my life is filled with activities from the time I get up until my head hits the pillow.  That is a pitiful excuse, but it is my struggle. Now don't get me wrong.  None of these activities are jumbos - like trying to hold down a job.  But they are the things that make up my life, that I can't drop because they give me satisfaction and/or they are part of taking care of my family.  I can't just drop taking care of mom.  She is so dependent now.  And neither family member drives, so I can't just say \"Sorry, I don't feel like driving today\" - not that either of them demand much in that area.  I spend 5 to 6 days a week taking care of my children's dogs.  I must have them for sanity!  But when they are here, I can't leave the house much because neither mom nor my husband could manage the 3 - I can hardly manage the 3.  I won't give up knitting, reading, knitting group, Tai Chi, weaving, blogging, walking or any of my other interests because the loss of those would make my life so colorless. Walking alone couldn't make up for the loss of my fun stuff.I can give up house cleaning and cooking (and have done so - sadly), but you know what will happen.  At some point I will explode and just becoming a cleaning machine, angry with myself for letting things get so far behind - skipping my fun stuff - including walking.Sometimes the balance of being in the house and not being in the house is a challenge.  Mom is pretty much house bound.  For example, just a trip to the bank can be an effort at times.  So she is stuck in the house.  She isn't one to have hobbies.  Her only hobby (other than watching me) seems to be reading, and she doesn't do that as much as she used to.  So my absences from the house seem to weigh heavily on her.  Many of my activities take me out of the house - so at times when I am ready to walk, I have already been gone alot that day for other stuff.  It is hard to put my walking shoes on and leave once again.And so those are my frustrations.  I still haven't heard back from God on my request for a 36 hour day.  Some have suggested that I get hire a caregiver to come in for mom so I could get more time away ... but neither my husband nor my mom would like that.  And I am not sure that would make things better anyway.  It is sort of like being a teacher.  Teachers do more work to prepare for the substitute teacher than if they just stayed did the job themselves.  Care giving is like that.  To hire a professional in home caregiver would require much prep work as to negate the positive benefits you are aiming for.  And I don't think it would add much value to mom's life either.  She hates change.I think that I have to accept that care giving of an elderly person alters your life no matter how much you struggle to prevent it.  Many of those alterations are subtle, not readily evident to the casual observer.  And it is one of the hinderances to getting a daily walk.Now for the Walking Self TalkYou will go out for a walk today.You will not look back at your poor performance so far in October.You will find a way to keep everything in your life - just not to excess.You will be happy that you have all these things in your life - because you want them there!You will allow yourself to whine occasionally, but you won't dwell on it.I feel so much better."},
{"title": "Hidden Power by Kati Marton", "date": "Tuesday, October 19, 2010", "text": "When my sister lent me this book and said it was good, I will admit to being a bit skeptical.  I mean, it is a book about First Ladies.  I couldn't help but wonder if this was a \"chic\" book - something that would only appeal to women.  I was sure that there would be no surprises.  After all, the First Ladies were all from the 20th century, with one inclusion of the Bush's from this century.  I lived through many of the periods they talked about. I was pretty much wrong on all counts.  This book focused on the marriages more than the First Ladies.  It was sort of glimpse inside the lives of twelve couples who happened to live inside a \"fish bowl\" called the Presidency.  The book details the behind-the-scenes dynamics of these couples starting with their early life together, their climb up the political ladder, and how they managed as a couple within the confines of  the Presidency.Achieving the job of President requires a certain talent, ego, and luck.  Historically it seems that it also takes a special pair of people to manage the supreme effort it takes to get that job and to survive in it.  It was abundantly clear that no matter how dysfunctional the marriage was, the strengths of the first spouses balanced the weakness and tempered the responses of the person holding office ... sort of like two sides of the same coin.  It was an interesting study in human nature.It is worth a read if you are interested in a behind-the-scenes look at marriages under unusual circumstances."},

And Halloween just keep popping up all over the neighborhood.I didn't get out for my walk today until 4:30.

For example:  left unwatched for a short 10 minutes this morning and he found a pink 3x5 card that he chewed up in little pieces.  When I discovered him, he had already eaten part of it.

{"title": "Blogging Journey", "date": "Saturday, October 16, 2010", "text": "I feel like a teenager who is counting the monthly anniversaries of the person they are dating!! Too silly, really.  But it has been almost 3 months since I started blogging!!  Who would have thought!Blogging is an interesting experience. I always thought that blog \"talk\" existed within a limited sphere: the posting, the comments and building a list of readers who \"follow\" publicly. But it is so much more.  Almost daily I hear from someone who has visited the blog - leaving no trace that they were there, but who drop me a private email or stop me in person to comment on something I wrote or a picture I took.  I am thrilled when I hear from a family member or friend, but I am very excited to hear from total strangers as well.  In fact, most blogs I visit are created by people I have never met and yet we have developed a kind conversation about events in our lives and shared interests.  It is great fun.This week I had a real surprise.  In a previous post I spotlighted a crock pot cook book  by Stephanie O'Dea called Make It Fast, Cook It Slow.  And the author actually commented on my blog post.  I was thrilled.  What a generous gesture for her to make.  It was just one more surprise in the blogging journey.Now I won't say it isn't a thrill to see my list of public followers grow (I am up to 13!!!)   But it seems like public followers are just the tip of the iceberg in this whole blogging process.   To someone like me who is pretty much tied to the house, this has been a great way of reaching out to people and hearing back from them.Thank you all who have become public followers.  I love it (not that I am counting or anything, but 13!!!)  A huge thank you to those of you who regularly comment.  As you know if you read a previous posting, I am a big pod cast listener.  Pod casters always plead with people to leave comments in iTunes for each recording.  I think I better understand why they want comments.  The process of blogging and pod casting is somewhat similar:  it is a one-way communication.  It is so much more fun if it becomes a conversation.  So if you are reading this posting, don't be shy!  Use that comment box.  And if you really want to make my day - become a public follower! Have I told you recently that I have 13 public followers so far!!!Not that I am counting.  Oh no, not me!  I am not counting.I am not obsessive at all.As my son's girl friend said so eloquently when she shared an article she had written with family and friends ... \"Stop Shameless Self-Promotion\".  :-)  And I responded with: I LOVE shameless Self-Promotion ... obviously!!Thanks for stopping in!"},
{"title": "Pod Casts - a tale of obsession!", "date": "Friday, October 15, 2010", "text": "This is a tale of obsession. I am hoping that someone will read this and say ... Oh, yes, this happened to me too.  And then I won't feel so so different!Four or five years ago, I was given a Apple Nano iPod for Christmas by my son.  I remember opening the box and thinking \"oh, my - whatever will I do with this.\"  Being a good mother, I quickly expressed my thanks.  He started showing me how to use it.  I search the Apple box for a booklet of instructions.  There were no instructions. My thoughts raced. (I am a Microsoft person.  I wanted, expected, prepared for complicated processes when it came to technology.  I wanted written instructions. Darn. I would have to focus and remember what he said .)And then he showed me how iTunes worked (oh man, no instructions there either ... keep focused on what he is saying, nod your head, ask questions, look interested!).  He then showed me all the music I could download (I guess he didn't know that I really don't really listen to music.) And then the first inkling of what was possible dawned.  I felt a small buzz.He started talking about pod casts.   Pod casts are similar to radio shows.  Some are done by professionals and many are done by talented amateurs.  And the topics run the whole gamete - any topic you can imagine.  (hmm, maybe there was something in this I might enjoy.) He asked me what I was interested in, and I said \"knitting\" (ha! good luck getting a hit on that topic).  He typed \"knitting\" in the search box.  A whole bunch of free pod casts on knitting popped up.  (oh no, pages and pages of  free knitting pod casts filled the screen.)I don't actually remember much after that - truthfully ... the next 3 weeks were a total blur.  I was busy searching for pod casts on all kinds of topics, downloading, listening, deleting ones I was done with, searching for more, and downloading again, over and over and over ... several times a day for weeks. At some point my son dropped by for a visit.  I held out my Nano and told him that he had given me a \"life sucking\" piece of equipment. I was no longer the master of my own life.  I was addicted to this thing.  What had he done?  He just smiled.Fast forward 6 months. I moved on to a iPod Classic ... way more memory ... able to store gazillions of pod casts.  Yes, in just 6 short months I had 2 iPods. Addiction counselors would see the signs of escalation - red flags.  Warning! Warning! - someone spinning out of control!  I listened to pod casts of every description.  At one point I had over 500 free pod casts on my iPod. Some were as short at 10 minutes, some ran to 90 minutes.   I figured out that if I listened to pod casts non-stop, around the clock, until they were all gone, it would take me over 12 days to listen all the pod casts I had downloaded. But I had lots of memory and the pod casts were free!!  Free entertainment.  The more the merrier was my attitude!!  I was in \"pod cast hoarder heaven\"!And then my iPod broke.Well not entirely broke - just sort of broke.  I couldn't add more pod casts to my iPod.  I had lots of unused memory but it wasn't accepting new pod casts. Since it was still under warranty,  I could return it and get another one ... but what about all the pod casts that were on this unit?  A new unit wouldn't have all my downloads.  It would take me hours to re-download all these pod casts.  I felt a little unsettled!  Signs of withdrawal??  So I started listening and deleting pod casts off the iPod at an accelerated rate.  Other pod casts started backing up on my computer just waiting to be put on an iPod. By the time I was ready to trade in my broken iPod ... I had reached a certain level of burn-out.  Pod cast burn-out!  I am sure that now in 2010 - this is a condition that has been studied in a medical journal somewhere.  I am surprised that we haven't heard about it on the nightly news.  When I returned home with my replacement iPod, I took a deep breath!  The Apple spell was interrupted.  I started to think rationally.Did I need all these pod casts?  I mean, like really.  Does anyone need hundreds of pod casts?When I began down loading again, I severely narrowed my subscriptions.Fast forward to the present.  I am cured ... mostly.  I don't download every day, I am subscribed to far fewer pod casts, and I think if my equipment failed, I would not hyperventilate.  I would handle the situation with clarity and maturity. Of course, I haven't been tested, but ...And besides, this past Christmas I got an iPod Touch and I discovered the wonderful world of Apps! The Apple advertisement that says \"There's an App for that!\" doesn't lie.  You can get an App for everything.  Lots of them are free.  Most are reasonably priced.  My iPod Touch has so much memory.  I have tons of free memory still.  And much of it is free entertainment!  And then in the spring Apple launched the iPad. So now I have one of those as well.  And more memory and lots of space for Apps.But I am much better, really!"},
{"title": "Rain Out!  What a Crock!", "date": "Thursday, October 14, 2010", "text": "No walk for me today.  Between all the down pours that are passing through our area and the errands I needed to run, and the trips to get the dogs - all 3 dogs - the day just didn't have enough hours in it for a walk.  It is a shame, because I would enjoy a rainy walk today.Before I left on my errands this morning, I set up dinner in the crock pot.  There would be no time for making dinner later in the day.  I love my crock pots (all 3 of them), and I love having dinner pretty much made by dinner time.  Crock pot cooking is something that I do all year long, but fall and winter are the best times for using the crock pot, because the meals are usually stick-to-your-ribs in character.  Perfect for cold and rainy days.  And you don't have to be a great cook to use a crock pot - even a mediocre cook like myself can place a great meal on the table with the help of a slow cooker.  The book pictured is called Make It Fast, Cook It Slow by Stephanie O'Dea.  I love this book for several reasons.  First and foremost, she is a blogger.  In 2008 she made a New Year's resolution to use her slow cooker every single day for a year and document her results daily on her personal web site called Crockpot365.blogspot.com.  By the time I discovered her, she was just about ready to release this book.  Like most cookbooks, she has recipes.  No surprise (but wouldn't it be fun to issue a cookbook with no recipes!! Maybe just talk about recipes but no actual recipies???  Ok, that is a dud of an idea, even for me).  But what is charming is that on many of the recipes, she has a section called \"The Verdict\".  Here she documents her experience in making the recipe and how her family felt about it.  This section sounds just like excerpts from her blog.  This recipe is not from the book.  This morning I didn't have time to plan anything.  I just marched to my pantry, openned the door and hoped that something in there would go with beef.  After I ruled out Marshmellow Fluff and Cheerios, I settled on garlic, mushroom soup and Beef Broth.  Later when it is closer to dinner I will taste it and decide what else I should add. I think I will add some thickening agent and then serve it over rice.  That is what is so great about crock pot cooking.  You almost can't go wrong (well, maybe if you added the Marshmellow Fluff ... that would be bad). It doesn't look like much but the smell is really wonderful.  Towards the end of the morning I was traveling north on Route 95 with Milo sleeping peacefully beside me.  The rain was so heavy at times that it collected on the roadway.  There had to be 3-4 inches of standing water.  It is unusual to see that much standing water on a major modern highway in our area. Roadways are graded to avoid just that scenario.  At one point I glanced to my right - looking east - and was startled to see that there were no geographic features to be seen.  A light steel gray color extended from the ground right up to the sky as far as you could see.  Looking left to the west, geographical features could still be seen.  I couldn't help glancing frequently to the east to make sure my eyes weren't playing games with me.  And looking north, the sky was a dark steel gray in color.  I was definitely driving into the worst of it.  I was very glad to get home where the fragrance of tonight's dinner had filled the house.  I usually like big weather events, but I like them best viewed from my front living room window with a cup of hot coffee in my hand. :-)The rest of the day should be a very quiet and uneventful time.  It is the sort of a day you can curl up on the couch with a good book or knitting, or maybe watch a movie ...  and be grateful for the tranquility of your home.  Of course, with 3 dogs in the house today through tomorrow evening, there is little chance that things will be quiet or tranquil.  Oh well, I dream on."},
{"title": "Halloween popping up all over", "date": "Wednesday, October 13, 2010", "text": "It is not Halloween yet, but I can feel the excitement building in the neighborhood.  I love Halloween.  I love standing outside on October 31st with my bucket of candy and greeting all the kids.  I love seeing the parents who also dress up while they follow their little ones around on their first Halloween. I love watching these parents prompt their offspring to say the magic words \"Trick or Treat\", they then prompt them again to say \"Thank You\".   Silly parents!  Once the candy hits their little bag, the costumed Super Man or Dracula, or Princess got what they came for ... and they are on to the next door.  I love sitting outside on a cool to cold evening with a hot cup of cider, wrapped in a shawl, watching the excitement of the kids as they walk up my sidewalk.  Yes, Halloween is special.Some of my neighbors really get into it with decorating their homes.  This year I can hardly wait to see what they do.  Creepy \"Thriller\" music plays loudly from one house, another house has a graveyard in the front and the residents greet the \"Trick or Treaters\" in costume.  One year someone had a fog generator that kept the whole front terraced area filled with rolling waves of fog.  It was very atmospheric!  I walk my neighborhood daily now and Halloween decorations are beginning to pop up down every street.  It makes the walk so interesting.  I missed this in past years. Either I wasn't walking or I wasn't looking, but I know I never saw the decorations of the surrounding neighborhoods.These two pictured decorations belong to my next door neighbor.  The spider on the front door was so cute.  I stood there looking at it for a bit.  I don't decorate, but I pondered if I should get something for my door.  Decorating for the various holidays used to be a passion for me.  Christmas, Valentines Day, Easter, July 4th, Halloween, Thanksgiving.  In fact, decorating for Christmas alone, used to take me several days.  I spent tons of time unpacking decorations, setting them out, packing away other stuff (yes, I was a bit of a clutter bug), and then when the holiday was over, I reversed the process and it took days to undo what I did just 3 weeks prior.  Over the years I dropped all the decorations - except for Christmas.  I still decorate for Christmas, but I limit it to one day of decorating. I discovered that all the decorations seemed to take the fun out of the holidays for me.  No one in my family enjoyed helping decorate.  I never got the feeling that they enjoyed the display of decorations.  It didn't seem to add to their enjoyment of the holidays.  I remember one year, I decided that I needed to have a real tree for our Christmas Tree.  My husband and I shopped for the tree - he didn't care which tree I picked - he said they all looked fine.  But he did the heavy lifting, carrying the tree into the house for me.  When I was ready to decorate the tree my son was home.  I asked for his help getting the tree into the tree stand.  He did his best to help, but the tree base was crooked making it difficult to mount it straight in the tree stand. After about 45 minutes of adjusting and swearing and adjusting again, I remember him stopping, looking up at me from the floor where he was struggling with the stand, and saying with a very straight face, \"Could I get you to convert to being Jewish?\" The next year I decided to simplify.  And I made a very pleasant discovery!  I was happier.  I enjoyed everyone else's decorations and I enjoyed all the holidays more.  Less effort, less stress, more satisfaction.  So simple.  But it was so interesting to see the temptation arise in me to buy maybe just one Halloween door decoration or maybe a pumpkin.  But the reality was, no one else in my family cared about it, and it didn't add that much to my enjoyment of the holiday.  No, I will pass on decorating.  But I am so very glad that there are people who do this and enjoy the process.  Yes, I can appreciate what others do and enjoy my own holidays without the added hub-bub!I am so looking forward to Halloween!"},

I tell you, this Tai Chi outside could become habit forming!! Here is our instructor leading the group through a difficult movement.  So this move looks easy, but I can tell you, it isn't!  Balance, balance, balance.  That is what it is all about along with lots of concentration. Our instructor makes it look easy.  Guess if you have been doing this sort of thing since you were a child - it should look easy.  We are looking really good here!  At least I think so.But this move is just prior to another one legged balancing  move.  When I am doing this, it is right about here where I am thinking ... \"ok, now concentrate, don't embarrass yourself, don't pinwheel your arms, don't think about anything but balance, balance, balance.\"  Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. That is why I am taking the pictures!  ;-)Our instructor has such grace.This move isn't that hardest one, but getting the weight on the correct foot is critical for me.   I am forever trying to put my weight on the front foot, and then trying to slide on the front foot.  Take it from me. Back foot for the weight, front foot for the slide.  Anything else ... failure! You would think that the knowing and the doing would go hand and hand.Not!The beauty of this lake can't be overstated. It is the perfect back drop to the peaceful practice of Tai Chi."},
{"title": "A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson", "date": "Sunday, October 10, 2010", "text": "When you hear the words - Appalachian Trail - most people on the east coast of America know what you are talking about.  Bill Bryson, another of my favorite authors, wrote about this trail in his book A Walk in the Woods, Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail.  If I had to pick only one book as my favorite, it would be this one.  This is the story of Bill Bryson, novice walker, and his very out-of-shape friend Stephen Katz as they prepare for and hike the Appalachian Trail (AT).  For those not familiar with this hike, the AT is 2,100 mile long trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine in the USA.  As Bill Bryson notes, it is the \"granddaddy\" of long hikes.  The trail meanders through numerous states, following forests and mountains.  The trail is the home of bears, bobcats, snakes, wolves, wild bore, coyotes ... the kinds of things you would expect to see in a wildness area.  The temperature ranges from below freezing to the sweltering heat of summer depending on when and where you begin your hike.  Periodically the trail has open wooden shelters that hikers can use, but typically the shelter provided is the one you carry on your back - a tent.  In fact, in true hiking style, you must carry everything you need on your back and plan carefully where you will depart from the trail to replenish your supplies and get a shower!  All this and more was discovered, learned and shared by the author in this book.This book is more than just a hiking book.  Interwoven in the story of the hike is the concerns for our fragile ecosystems and a plea for conservation of America's last great wilderness area.  Respecting nature is the thread that runs through this book in a very moving way.  In addition he shares some of the stories about the risks of hiking this remote trail, from reported bear attacks to brutal murders.  It is a fascinating look at what it takes to walk the trail from start to finish.One of the appealing aspects of this book is Bill Bryson's very humorous style of writing.  He is very comfortable poking fun at his and Steven's naive beliefs and ignorance.  In fact, chapter one was laugh-out-loud funny.  Not being a hiker previously, Bill Bryson goes on a shopping trip to a local outfitters, the Dartmouth Co-op, to purchase equipment.  That chapter launches to rest of the book into a very enjoyable read.  To close I would like to leave you with a quote from the book in where he talks about the woods. This quote is from Chapter 4.  It is very early on in his experience with walking the trail so his observations are probably pretty typical of an average person who lives in our built up country.  Some one like you or me.\"Woods are not like other spaces. To begin with, they are cubic.  Their trees surround you, loom over you, press in from all sides.  Woods choke of views and leave you muddled and without bearings.  They make you feel small and confused and vulnerable, like a small child lost in a crowd of strange legs.  Stand in a desert or prairie and you know you are in a big space.  Stand in a woods, and you only sense it. They are a vast, featureless nowhere.And they are alive.\"  Bill Bryson, A Walk in the Woods.Note: The book is categorized as Travel and was originally published in 1998.  Since that time the author has written several other books.  I haven't read all his works, but those I had read have all been worth the time.  He is a gifted story teller."},
{"title": "#10 Appreciate the Small", "date": "Saturday, October 9, 2010", "text": "My life is filled with so many wonderful smaller things ... stuff I overlook all the time.  Like the trees as they change to brilliant colors in the fall.  Who looks at the single leaf? If left unchecked, I would focus on only the big stuff of life - big fun, big loses, big achievements, big hurts, big happiness ... missing all the little stuff ... the little stuff that actually fills my life.I once owned a book called Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life by Jon Kabat-Zinn.  It has one of those glitzy titles ... one meant to catch the casual shopper.  And it caught me, but it does have a great message.  I can't find the book now, but I remember the first time I read it.  I thought, \"Wow, great idea, slowing down the pace of your life, paying attention to the everyday activities, enjoying the moment, focusing on the now.\"  And then, of course, in one of my fits of cleaning I pitched the book.  I wish I hadn't.  Now I have to get another copy.I know can find happiness, satisfaction, contentment in the everyday activities of living if I focus on the everyday things that give me happiness and satisfaction and contentment.  I did alittle of that focusing during \"beach week\" ... the week when my family went to the Outer Banks and I remained home. In previous years I ruminated for a whole week on what I was missing - the whole darn week!!  This time I focused on my walks, on my visit with friends, on my knitting group, on Tai Chi, on my cats who were thrilled with my undivided attentions.  Yes, I still missed my family, and the grand dogs, and the missed the fun of the sand and the ocean, but I was able to live with what I had rather than what I didn't.  I focused on the smaller contentments rather than the big missed vacation.  It was a happier week.The challenge is how to apply that focus to the whole of my life - not just one week.Writing this blog has helped me see the daily events in my life differently.  Walking, pets, hobbies, writing!  I had a huge response to my posting on feeding the wild birds and the squirrels.  Birds and squirrels are such a small part of my life, but when I think back on it - focus on it, I realize they are so much more.  They have provided endless hours of entertainment for my 2 cats and my mom.  I can't tell you how many times my mom says \"oh, look at the red bird\" - like it is the first time she has seen it instead of the tenth time.  And the cats think of my deck slider as \"TV for Cats\". They love staring down the squirrels (and everyone is pretty brave with solid glass between them).  And I have learned so much about the kinds of birds that reside in my neighborhood.  I have identified almost 20 so far.  And writing about my experiences was great fun and seemed to provide entertainment to others.  A small thing that was bigger than I thought. And then there are the things in life that are minimized and overlooked, but are huge when they are at risk of being taken away ... like vision and reading.  In a previous posting about reading more, I commented on my husband's reduced vision.  Certainly neither one of us ever thought for a moment that one of us would loose the ability to read.  Reading is like breathing, after all.  You just do it.  You were lucky enough to be given the gift of reading as a child, you've done it all your life, you assume because you can do it now you will always be able to do it.  It becomes minimized over time compared with the other things in your life. And so you forget to appreciate it, to view it as important, to see it as an immensely vital part of your daily living.  It is small. Until you don't have it.Small stuff ... appreciate it!The first 10 goals of my 20 are public.  These were the easy ones.  These are the ones I can achieve based on my current limitations. The last 10 goals are beyond my reach right now.  They have mostly to do with travel, with further education, maybe part time employment, volunteer opportunties, changes of life style or location ... all of which are impossible because they involve more time away from the home or changes that won't accomodate my family members needs.  So I'll hold off listing anything further for now.  These 10 are enough to keep me occupied. Those last 10 can wait until I am more free - or God grants my request for a 36 hour day."},
{"title": "Walking the Lake", "date": "Friday, October 8, 2010", "text": "Today I got the rare opportunity to walk Centennial Lake.  I left Milo at the vet's this morning (he wasn't all that happy), and I hurried to a Tai Chi practice.  I was late, but able to practice for maybe 30 minutes.  The picture was taken from a distance and under the tent it shows a few of the Tai Chi members practicing the movements.  It is a beautiful and peaceful place for Tai Chi.When practice ended I took off for a walk around the lake by myself.  The sun was brilliant, the lake follage was beginning to show its colors. I was thrilled to have 45 minutes alone to enjoy a beautiful walk.  Crisp, cool, clear.How wonderful it would be to walk this lake every day.Today is a big, big day in Milo-land!Today Milo starts the day as a sweet heart of a dog, but also as a \"man\", a \"big boy\", a \"fully hung guy\", ready to mount everything and anything, ready to defend his mama from everything and everyone (even moths), guarding his territory, his food, his bone.  And he thinks his lady vet is a super person!And today, Milo ends the day as a sweet heart of a dog, but also as a better pet, a happier dog, a healthier puppy, a more loving member of the family - and less of a pain in the b*tt!!  At least that is what we hope in the future.  And that super lady vet? eh - not so much!I am also guessing that he won't be prone to sleep this way in the future - or maybe that is just a dog thing!"},
{"title": "Dentists - why do they do it!", "date": "Thursday, October 7, 2010", "text": "How do you feel about going to the dentist?  That was what I did today.  Not a routine appointment.  One of my crowns broke and needed to be replaced. I am not ever happy about going to the dentist.  I am a good patient and do everything they say, but twice a year after my regular dental appointment I always breath a sigh of relief that I am free for the next 6 months - unless, of couse, something comes up like today.Now to be perfectly clear, my dentist isn't the problem.  He is fabulous!!  I've seen this same dentist for over 35 years.  Now his son is in practice with him, and I see the son as well.  And both are skilled, knowledgeable, gentle, and caring doctors.  Their practice has been rated first in our city.  He has been recognized by professional organizations as a highly respected dentist and he has featured in multiple magazine articles. And when I was in bad, bad pain over a weekend several years ago (pain that made it impossible to close my eyes all night, pain that made me nauseous, pain that Advil didn't even touch no matter how much I took), he came into the office on a Saturday afternoon  (in his running clothes, no less) to see me, and he got me in with an excellent root canal specialist on a Saturday evening (she and her husband came in from a party to do my root canal).  So I have absolutely no complaints with these wonderful people.  They were there when I needed them and over the years, I have had absolutely top notch dental care.Can you hear the \"but\" just hanging in the air?  I was raised during the \"drill and fill\" generation.  In my youth I developed an aversion to going to the dentist.  And the fact that I still have all my teeth at age 63 after such a terrible start as a child is a tribute to the wonderful care I got over the last 35 years. And now for the \"but\" ... But I don't like people putting their fingers in my mouth. I don't even like to put my own fingers in my mouth!!  I don't like holding my mouth open  so that they can do the work.  I don't like the pointy tools they use to check my teeth and gums. I don't like the sounds their tools make.  I don't like the Novocaine injections (but I wouldn't do without them either). And don't forget the x-rays. I must have the smallest mouth because those darn film cards hurt my gums every time.  What I don't understand is why anyone would want to go into this profession?  Why would you want to work in someone's mouth?  Why would you want to work with patients who really don't want to be there? If anyone knows, I would love to hear about it.But I am really glad someone wants to do this work, and I am really, really glad I saw my dentist of 35 years today, because the crown was broken and has to be replaced!  And he is the absolute best!  It is sort of a love-hate relationship, don't you think?  :-)So how do you feel about the dentist?"},
{"title": "Wild Life Friends", "date": "Wednesday, October 6, 2010", "text": "I walked today and it felt good.  It was gray and cool and perfect.  I remembered that this kind of weather was what I thought about when I was walking in the heat and humidity of summer.  These are the glory days of walking.  No heat, or freezing temps, or ice or snow.  Just cool crisp days!  I love Fall.Fall and Halloween decorations are popping up in the neighborhoods.  Leaves fill the streets and sidewalks.  The squirrels are boldly grabbing all the acorns they can find.  Since squirrels are notorious for not remembering where they hide their food, they overcompensate by hording beyond their needs.  When they can't find their hidden meals, they turn up at my bird feeder - stealing seed from my resident birds.  I know that some people find squirrels to be pests.  But I enjoy watching their antics and acrobatics.  I admire their ingenuity and persistence in seeking food.  And they proved to me that they do have some memory.  Last winter I began feeding the birds on my deck.  In the spring the squirrels showed up.  To deflect the squirrels, I bought a squirrels resistant feeder, called a Squirrel Buster, and corn cobs.  My thought was that I would throw out the corn cobs for the squirrels keeping them busy freeing the feeders for the birds.  And it worked. It actually worked too well.  Every morning I would come down stairs to make the coffee, open the blinds and pull back the kitchen slider blind - and every morning a squirrel would be sitting on my balcony staring back at me ... waiting.  I would open the slider, he would retreat to the banister, I would fill the feeders and then throw a corn cob over the deck.  He would scamper off to retrieve it ... and all would be well. Friends who would visit would comment on what a chubby squirrel he was. My husband and I joked that maybe we should name him.  But reason took hold.  The next thing you know, I would be taking him for regular veterinary care!  No, no naming of the wild life!Then one morning I opened the slider blind and there were 2 squirrels sitting there ... staring back.  Word was spreading!  At one point we had 4 squirrels. We were wondering if they were a family.  It was alittle creepy because the numbers were climbing.  But the final straw happened one day when I was returning from a walk.  I was walking on the sidewalk parallel to my town home, and I became aware that something was moving beside me.  I stopped and looked down.  Not 3 feet away was the squirrel looking back at me.  I started to walk and he kept pace.  Totally freaked, I stamped my feet and he moved away.  But not too far.  I was the corn cob lady after all, and you never know when she would toss one.  So, yes, I do think squirrels have memory - selective memory like everyone else.  And there is one out there who is keeping an eye on me.We were moving into summer and the birds would not starve, so I stopped feeding everyone.  EVERYONE!  The squirrels still came for a few weeks and then finally gave up.  Now that it is fall, I am back to feeding the birds again.  And I probably will feed the squirrels as well.  I still have a few of those corn cobs.  I am guessing it will take the wild life a little while to figure out \"she's back!!!\".  :-)I love feeding the birds.  I have two bird books for the mid-Atlantic region and I have kept track of the birds I have seen off my back deck. Once I saw a Cooper Hawk in the trees behind my house.  As I was admiring him through my binoculars, he took flight.  I kept watch and he dived towards my deck, obviously going after one of the birds.  I quickly looked him up in my book and sure enough, he eats lots of things and one was other birds!  Darn.  I was now creating a smorgasbord for his lunch.  Somehow this feeding the wild life was more complicated than I thought.Last winter when we had many feet of snow on the ground, I know I kept a small flock of birds alive behind my house.  During one of the mega east coast snow storms I discovered that my bird feeder couldn't keep up with the demand - there were too many birds. I filled a pie plate with seed but the snow was coming down so fast, it would cover the seed before they could eat.  So I put an umbrella over the pie pan so they could feed under shelter. My neighbors never asked what I was doing ... probably better not to question the nut next door! I'll be feeding the birds again this winter. And if I need to keep a family of squirrels alive again this winter, so be it.  They are hungry too!For those who are interested in how to control squirrels, check out: Squirrels, 101 Cunning Stratagems to Reduce Dramatically the Egregious Misappropriation of Seed from Your Birdfeeder by Squirrels by Bill Adler, Jr.  It is a very fun read, because everyone knows that you can't outwit squirrels.

{"title": "A Caramel Apple and Flexeril", "date": "Monday, October 4, 2010", "text": "Here I sit with a caramel apple and muscle relaxants in my stomach, a heating pad on my neck, my Hazel Rose Loom on my lap, a very demanding cat by my side and wet feet. You know what is missing from my life?  Routine.  I have lost my routines and life seems to be just one unexpected thing after another.  I have missed so many Tai Chi sessions it is embarrassing, I have missed almost as many walks, blogging has slipped from everyday to every other day (and today I noticed it has been 4 days since I posted anything).  There are good reasons for that.It has been a struggle for a few weeks to keep on top of stuff, but as we approached last weekend, I was looking forward to several days with \"my mutts\".  Dogs are good for reducing stress, right?  Little did I know.  In the last two weeks, Milo had \"become a man\" ... testosterone was flowing freely through his system this weekend.  As is typical with teenagers, he didn't know how to handle this new \"big boy\" feeling.  He barked at everything, became hyper-vigilant protecting his mama from all the bad guys that prance through my living room, and humped every dog he could get to stand still. And he spent most of the weekend taunting Meathead - a senior citizen - to play with him.  The barking, the nipping of the jowls and feet, and the sleep disruptions were more than poor Meaty could tolerate.  I think the stress caused Meaty to have alot of seizure-like behavior the whole weekend.  Much time was spent keeping the dogs apart and medicating Meathead.  When the weekend was over, we were all sleep deprived and felt like disaster survivors.  Next weekend should be better.  Milo gets those offending little \"nuts\" cut off, and my son will be in town so his boys will spend most of the weekend in their quiet adult house.  My son also needs to get Meaty's seizure meds adjusted so that he can tolerate \"life\" a bit better.Today is a rainy Monday, and I had a list five things that I needed to do outside the house.  I invited both my husband and my mom to go with me - both declined! (Yeah!!!  Some time to myself.)  But I woke with a stiff neck so before going out I used a heating pad and took 800 mg of Motrin - just to knock that pain out - so I could enjoy my morning.  When I left my neck was still stiff.  I tried to ignore it, even adding two more stops to my already busy morning (just for the fun of it I went to Borders and to Joanne Fabrics - and yes, I did get some fun stuff), but as the morning proceeded, my neck was getting worse and expanding into my shoulder.  So at my last stop, I picked up some Caramel Apples (I am sure they are good for a stiff neck) and some Shrimp Chowder for lunch.  Did you know that the Caramel Apple is the perfect food?  Think about it.  This fall favorite has an apple which is a fruit, the caramel is a starch, and the nut covering is protein.  Perfect and well balanced.  And the Shrimp Chowder was yummy too.And the Flexeril?  Well, I had a few pills from 2009 - technically they are over a year old, but they are still good I am sure (hoping).  And if the one I took 45 minutes ago doesn't kick in soon, I will be taking another.   I need to have full range of motion in my neck to finish my weaving before tomorrow. Priorities, priorities! Pictured below is my 12\" Hazel Rose Loom with a piece of weaving almost finished.  On top of it is my 4\" Weave-It loom - shown just to give scale.  The Hazel Rose Loom is oak wood and stained exactly the same color as my living room furniture.  My future orders with them will be of different woods. Here's hoping that I get my old boring, but routine driven life back.  And here's hoping that Flexeril starts to work soon.Guess I should get my feet out of these wet shoes!  Happy Monday all."},

Someday I will figure out how to use my camera!! :-)So when that didn't work I settled for a picture of Meaty at the front door, sad that it was still raining.  He doesn't like being wet and although he has pretty good bladder control, he can't wait until Saturday to step outside ... which is what he wants ... Saturday, when it will be dry and cool and a beautiful fall day.  I'm with ya' Meaty!Today I had three dogs take care of, and walk, and feed and play with, and medicate (Milo has an ear infection and although he is the smallest of the 3 dogs ... it is a world-class wrestling match to put ointment in his ears).  I picked up Milo yesterday, and last night Milo and I were up twice to go out for a walk.  It was just pouring buckets of water at 3:30 am and, of course, Milo wasn't thrilled about going out in that.  But I was persistent.  We stood under my small front porch - me holding a large golf umbrella and Milo staring out into the great downfall wondering why it was so important that he go out just now!! Knowing Milo ... I am sure he thought my carpet would work just fine for him till the rain stopped.  He finally took a deep breath, ran out into my front yard squatted quickly and then return to the porch.  Now you should know that he didn't get even the least bit wet, because I held the large umbrella over him the whole time.  I got wet, but the little prince didn't!  ;-)On the up side, earlier in the week I placed an order for some beautiful hand-held looms from Hazel Rose Looms.  They can be found at the following link:  http://www.hazelroselooms.com/I took this picture off my iPad with my camera (sort of a picture of a picture), so doesn't show them off well.  Other pictures will follow when I get them.  But in talking with Hazel about my order she shared that Ravelry has a group specifically for hand held looms.  I don't know why I am surprised.  They have groups for everything.  I am eager to get my looms.Well today is the last day of September. No walk for me today.  Actually the end of September was been almost a total bust with walks and step counts. I think I reached my 10,000 average steps (won't know for sure until I update Walker Tracker) but I was doing way better than that at mid-month.  October is another month.  I'll do better than September.  And if I just keep doing better with each month, the end result will be sensational!  Welcome October!!!  You can't get here soon enough!"},

His book A Walk Across America was my introduction to him and his writing style, and I was hooked.  His story begins as a young man living during the Vietnam era.  He came from a very normal New England family of comfortable means and he had completed his education, but was disillusioned with the American society he found himself in.  Thinking he might consider just leaving this country, he was encouraged to explore America before giving up on the country. And explore he did, on foot, close up and personal.  He sets out with his dog Cooper (pictured on the cover), walking from New England down to New Orleans, Louisiana.  Being young is definite advantage to setting out on this kind of journey.His walk takes him through the large range of peoples and cultures that make up America.  Until I read this book, I can honestly say I didn't give much consideration to the huge range of peoples that make up our country.  It was a real reminder to me of what makes our country so great.  He camped along road sides, walked through raging snow storms, stayed in seedy motels, ate foods typical of the area, interacted with the local characters of the small communities he passed through, and temporarily settled in various communities for brief periods working various day-laborer jobs when he ran out of money. It was a fascinating and difficult adventure to read about. The second book, The Walk West: A Walk Across America 2, chronicles his walk from New Orleans to the Pacific Coast - walking with his wife.  His description of walking across the desert and the Rocky Mountains was riviting.  Peter Jenkins is the author of several other books - I have read them all:Looking for AlaskaAlong the Edge of AmericaAcross ChinaAnd his opinion of America from his experiences?... there is no where else as wonderful as this country. I have to agree with him - especially after reading his books."},
{"title": "Today I \"caved\"!", "date": "Monday, September 27, 2010", "text": "I am sooo tired today.  I caved.It is rainy - all day rainy.  This is the view from my front step.  Rain.  I usually like a rainy day. Today it makes me tired.I walked.  I usually get a \"second wind\" from walking.  Today it made me tired. I have Tai Chi practice on Mondays.  Instead I sat on the couch and watched \"Monk\". I felt bad missing practice, but the rain, and the tired ...  Today - no Tai Chi.I want to take a nap. I don't nap well.  I can't sleep in the middle of the day and if I do (rare), I feel terrible when I wake up. I feel bad for hours after.  Today ... napping is the last thing I would do.I have $75 in gift cards for Borders Book Store.  I could get $75 of whatever I want for noth'en.  But that would mean leaving my couch.  Today ... no free stuff for me.The only thing I didn't cave in on was ... walking.  I am proud of myself for walking.  The rest will just have to wait until I feel better.And I did weave-it weaving today while sitting on the couch.  And through the magic of the Internet and on line shopping while sitting on the couch, I ordered some new hand held looms.  And tonight is \"Dancing With The Stars\" so I will be watching that.  I can do that from my couch, dressed in my PJ's with knitting in my hands and a glass of wine.  I think by tonight I will have sprouted roots in this couch.Tomorrow is knitting and dog day!  I should be better tomorrow.  Post Note:  Yes, I watch Dancing With The Stars.  I love it.  I love the dancing, the costumes, the improvements some stars make, the guest entertainers, the comments of the judges (they can be so funny), the music, the unexpected stuff that happens (it is live) ... I love it all.  It is something that mom and I can share - she loves it too."},
{"title": "The Curse of the Stuff Shells", "date": "Saturday, September 25, 2010", "text": "This week has been difficult to keep up with.  I feel like a rat running in a wheel.  I have missed blogging twice, I have missed logging steps for several days, I have failed to go for my walk for several days in a row, I have been out of sorts all day (probably because I didn't walk.)  The week seemed filled with many \"carnival pop-up activities\" ... to-dos that come out of no where and go on and on,  like the carnival game where you take a hammer and pound down each pop-up head only to discover another head pops up, and then another and another. As we closed in on the end of the week, I got some very sad news from my cousin in PA.  The week was not getting better. And today was a \"company dinner day\" at our house and I was serving the stuff shells.  I should have known better - and ordered carry out pizza instead.  Let me explain.Last January we scheduled a get together with old friends at our house.  I planned on making these stuff shells - new recipe for me.  January being January, some of our friends were sick with flu-like symptoms, so we rescheduled to February - still at our house.  We ate the 2 trays of shells in January - they were good but it was a lot of shells.  By February I was ready to make the shells again - 2 trays.   And again, we were foiled.  No one could come because we got between 2-3 feet of snow that weekend. So again, we ate 2 trays of shells.  I felt pretty sure I wouldn't be making these again anytime soon.  I saw a pattern forming.  And besides, I was pretty tired of them by now.This September it was my turn to make the company dinner, and again I made the shells (after all, none of our friends had tried them yet, and it has been 7 months since I last made them).  I held off until this morning to throw the recipe together - delaying the cooking (just in case - I am not superstitious, but ... ).  As it turned out one person had severe bronchitis and didn't come, and right before folks were to arrive, my son calls me from the emergency room were he was with his girlfriend.  She is a runner and was running a 20 mile race this morning.  She collapsed just after crossing the finish line.  Turns out she was ok, probably dehydration (I wish the summer temperatures would just give up!) but still it was a scary situation.  We are so glad she is ok.  I didn't have time to think on this because as I hung up the phone, our friends arrived.  We were not totally canceled out, but the gods did seem to have it out for us once again.  I guess we should be happy there isn't 3 feet of snow outside today.So this bad karma day which included some other disturbances ... this day (and this week), is finally over. Really, I am not a superstitious person, but I can't decide if we broke the curse of the stuff shells or we just managed to survive it.Tomorrow I will decide if I should throw that recipe away.  Too bad, it is a good meal!"},
{"title": "# 9 Read - I think I remember how.", "date": "Thursday, September 23, 2010", "text": "I used to read a bunch! It was my main thing to do.  We had a library in our house.  And I read everything.  I loved all kinds of books: adventure, science fiction, autobiography, historical fiction, romance, escapist stories, you name it.  Not very focused I know, but I didn't discriminate.  And I was married to a man who valued reading almost above everything else.  He had a huge growing personal library and didn't really use the public library because owning the book was almost as important as reading it.  And as our disposable income grew, we built a large collection of books between us.Then in the 90's I stopped reading for fun - like a cold dead stop!  I was too busy with working to read.  I read some, but it was all work related stuff and when I was free of work - like at 2:00 am, I was sleeping. I think back on that time as a \"sick\" time.  Reading was just one of the many things I stopped.  I worked all the time.  I no longer had time to read, to walk, to stay connected with people (unless they were work people) and I didn't have hobbies either.  When I finally came to my senses, I started to add things back into my life - starting with my husband and kids (I said it was a sick time, didn't I?).  And then I took up knitting.  Knitting was my main vehicle back to a normal life.  As my husband said at the time, paying for knitting classes was cheaper than paying for therapy.  Did I mention that I am thankful that my husband stuck around during the 7 years of my \"sick time\"?  I am grateful - in the extreme.But not everything returned.  Reading for fun did not return.  I have listened to a number of audio books - I guess that counts some.  And the \"reading train\", that was fueled greatly by my husband's love of books, slowed a lot when he sold off his personal library.  His eyes were failing him (how cruel is that), and to prepare for the possible inability to read, he sold his books.  He has replaced them over time with a huge audio library. He listens to books all the time, but the physical act of sitting, reading, turning the pages of a book ... that is rare for him now. Never, never fail to appreciate the smaller things of life.  Sometimes they are bigger than you think.I miss reading, and I want it back. So I have added this as a goal - I can't say I am reading a lot right now, but it is happening more and more. And there are some favorites that I would like to share.  In looking at other blogs, lots of people make lists of the books they have read.  I think I will expand on this idea a bit.  I'll make a list over time.  But some books are special enough to devote a full posting to talk about them.  Reading will be a struggle for awhile. This reading thing has to fit inside my current life that is already filled with other hobbies, mom duties, dog time, doctor appointments, taxi service for my family, exercise, not to mention occasionally (and I mean very occasionally) cleaning a toilet or running the vacuum.  But it is a 20 year goal."},
{"title": "Complaints from the \"peanut gallery\"", "date": "Tuesday, September 21, 2010", "text": "Walking daily with my camera, I have taken a number of picture of beautiful leaves.  The trees are still very green, but leaves are falling at a fast rate, and those that hit the ground are sometimes beautiful - such as this one.Can you tell I am sooo ready for fall? My walk was less than perfect at its start today ... complaints from the peanut gallery interferred.  I needed to get up early and be out the door by 7:30 am to fit a walk into my already packed day.  So I set the alarm for 6:00 am thinking that I would be ready to walk by 7:30 (I am not really a morning person so 90 minutes to get all the parts of my body moving in a coordinated fashion seemed appropriate).Once out the door little complaints were being sent from my legs, my ankles, my feet, my thighs, cycling back around again to my legs ... and so on, messages that said \"too early, what are you thinking, we work better at 9:30 or so, go back in the house until 9:30, too early, too early\"  ... messages for the first 45 minutes of my walk.  I just kept moving and ignoring.  I was out for my walk, the day was beautiful and cool, and every one of my body parts just need to get their act together.  At least, that is the message my mind kept sending to my legs, ankles and feet.  At the 45 minute mark (8:15-ish) in the walk, I guess all the little complainers gave up, because then it was smooth sailing ... for the last 20 minutes.  And to reward myself, today was knitting group day!  Another magnificent morning, with magnificent friends, sharing a magnificent hobby. My second reward was getting my two grand dogs, Meathead and Grimace, in the afternoon."},

Mama always promises me that she won't leave me ... but I know better!  Like today.She slipped out this door to go grocery shopping, she said.  We didn't need any more food ... I have plenty!  So I sat by the door waiting.Finally my grandma opened the door for me.Better!  I can now see where she is going.  Oh no maybe not.  I don't see her.Oh, there she is in the black car driving away!  Away from me.  Can't she tell that I am not in the front seat with her?I finally got Grandma to take me out.  Gone!!  But I could smell her.  I know if I could just go down to the curb, she might be waiting there for me. I am waiting.Waiting, and waiting.I know she was here because I still catch her scent.  (She smells soooo good!  Just like a mama should.)Why would she go away without me?I am just going to sit right here and wait.Waiting, waiting, waiting.Still no mama!Sigh.I am at the curb!  She is not here.Waiting!Still waiting!Ok, so Grandma let's go in.  She has left us both!  Let me check just one more time.Grandma is a good couch buddy, but I sure wish mama was here!YEAH!  She is home, home home!!!!I so love my hugs!And those kisses, I so need my kisses.But what I need more than anything, is my mama!And, she came back.  I knew she would.

{"title": "Afghanistan Lecture Series", "date": "Sunday, September 19, 2010", "text": "I did something different today.  I attended an interesting program on Afghanistan.  Our local library sponsored three lectures in the Distinguished Scholars Series.  I was dog free so I thought I would take advantage of a wonderful offering.The lecture I attended was called:  America's War: A View From the Ground.  The speaker, Seth G. Jones, Ph.D, is a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation and adjunct professor at Georgetown University.  He served as a Senior Advisor to the Commanding General for US Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan and is the author of In the Graveyard of Empires: America's War in Afghanistan. Besides being very knowledgeable, Dr. Jones was very careful to avoid taking political sides in the discussion. He did provide the probable impacts to the US if we remained in or withdraw from Afghanistan, and made it clear that there is no easy or correct answer.  Since I try to stay politically neutral, I greatly respected his ability to present facts without slanting them to a personal agenda. A rare gift, indeed.A side note:  He looked very young to be a Ph.D and to have traveled in extensively in Afghanistan and to have been a advisor to our Special Forces!  Young, I am telling you!!   Young!!!  But I was encouraged that such young people are so knowledgeable.  Really, I was way impressed with his demeanor as well as his commanding knowledge of the topic ... I couldn't help but wonder exactly when our generation (the baby boomers) slipped from the lead roles.  I am sure every generation wonders the same thing. I had signed both mom and my husband up to attend, but they both bailed out on me this morning so I went by myself. Mom always hates to see me go to things \"by myself\" - as if there is some horror in arriving to your destination without an entourage.  I keep reminding her, I am very happy with my own company.  I have so little time to myself, that when I do get time away ... just me, I am thrilled.  No matter how many times I tell her, she doesn't believe me.There are 2 other lectures, but both fall on days when I have the dogs, so I don't think I will get to attend those.  The other 2 lectures are by different presenters and the titles are: The Case for Withdrawal and Toughing It Out.  Both are focused on Afghanistan.  Very timely topics and sound interesting.  I will hold the dates just on the off chance I can attend."},
{"title": "Walking my legs off in September!", "date": "Saturday, September 18, 2010", "text": "Once again I walked Centennial Lake today with my husband - the weather just can't be any better - cool, breezy, sunny with no humidity!  The lake still looks very green but, the coming of fall will bring great changes - I love it!I noticed when I logged my miles for today's walk on MapMyRun.Com, I had totaled 53.96 miles during my exercise walks for September - as of September 18th!! Still many days left in September.  That is outstanding, because in all of August I had logged only 51.95 miles - for the whole month.  I have really upped my effort this month.  I should be well ahead in September when I sum up my exercise efforts. Of course, the down side of that is that I have made October more of a challenge!There were also tons of people at the lake.  When we pulled into the parking lot I commented to my husband that some kind of activity must be going on because the parking lots were all full.  Not so, just everyone enjoying the beautiful outdoors.  I did make a mental note to avoid the weekends - weekdays are much more quiet.And tomorrow my family returns from the beach!! Yeah!!!  Looking at my To-Do list, I won't do quite as well in the completions as I did in the walking miles. I'll look at it again tomorrow.Hope you did something wonderful this magnificent Saturday."},
{"title": "Three beauties in the woods", "date": "Friday, September 17, 2010", "text": "My walked got pushed into the afternoon.  I prefer the morning but I wasn't getting up early to fit in a walk.  So after Tai Chi, a trip to the vet's, a bank visit with mom and lunch and a few other little things, I took off for my walk I was restless again today and decided take one of the wooded paths that trails between the edge of the watershed and a housing development.  It was cooler and deeply shaded.  No too long into this walk I spied two little ears sticking up over the edge of a fence (I thought of Milo immediately - look at the ears!) I looked closer and the ears disappeared.  So I walk to the side of the patch of trees and there were three little guys - two were babies for sure and one was just a bit older.  They stared back.  I got a few pictures and they never moved.  I could help but wonder if their mom was somewhere near.I continued my walk down the path and saw several \"No Dumping Signs\".  I finally stopped to see what was being dumped.  Apparently local residents were dropping old vegetation over the edge of the fence.  I am sure they don't think this is a problem as they are not dumping actual garbage.  But this kind of dumping is not good for the environment, and it does attract rodents to nest there.  If they knew that they could be attracting mice and rats so close to their homes, they might not dump there.  I am not sure the signs are making a difference.I walked back into the neighborhoods and noticed this little doorway in the side of a tree.  Very cute indeed.  Maybe Alice from Wonderland lives in that tree.  It is a very cute lawn decoration for sure.I kept pushing on, feeling pretty good but I noticed my feet were beginning to hurt.  That was new since I bought my new walking/running shoes.  I looked down and discovered ... I had not changed my shoes before going out.  I wasn't in my good running shoes at all.  It is good to know that the $150.00 that I spent for those running shoes was well spent!I"},
{"title": "Dodging snipers!", "date": "Thursday, September 16, 2010", "text": "I am mid-week in waiting for my family to return from the beach - and my grand-dogs ... they will return too.It is the silence, the quiet, the stillness of our house without the frequent visits of the grand-dogs that has been the most difficult.  I filled that void with sounds of the vacuum, the steam cleaner, the iPod, the TV, and when I could, I left the house to see friends, to run errands, to walk ... but sometimes I just enjoyed the quiet. Now you should know that the house isn't totally void of living things  There are five of us here - three people and two cats - but all us are pretty darn quiet on our own!  My mom is 84 so she keeps a pretty low profile, and my husband is kind of a hermit - hermits are not party animals, and the pets are cats - their claim to fame is stealthy silence, quiet but deadly attacks on stuffed mice, and inscrutable staring.  The only one who is sometimes noisy is me, and I hadn't had my morning coffee yet.  So when I suddenly interrupted the silence early this morning with a VERY BIG NOISE, it was jarring.As usual, I was up before everyone, doing my normal stuff, checking the thermostat for the outside temperature, getting the coffee ready, opening the blinds, setting out mom's dishes and cereal and pills, and opening up a window to let in the cool air.  Unfortunately I forgot to turn off the house alarm, so when I opened a window the mega-horn began to scream and scream and scream in big, big wailing noise - mega noise - made more startling because of the silence of the house over the last few days.  The sound jolted me ... swear words erupting from my mouth as I was running to the key pad to punch in the disarm code to shut down the alarm and stop that blasted horn.  And sometimes it takes several frantic tries at keying in the code before the system accepts it ... like today!!And then the call from the alarm monitoring service checking to see if we were all right.  I am always embarrassed when they call, because we are \"always all right\".  When I answer the phone I want to say in a cool, collected manner:         \"Oh yes, I was just testing the system,       we are good,       just making sure that we hear from you guys if we have a problem,       good job on calling us so fast.       Ta-ta for now.\"But being frazzled by the sound of that awful horn, the frustration of not getting the horn off sooner ... they get this honest and slightly frenetic response:      \"I am sooo sorry!!!      Yes, yes, we are all right.      Oh my God, that horn is so loud.      You see I opened this window and ....      Oh, no, please, don't call the police!!! I am still in my pajamas!!!      Sorry, sorry, sorry.       My name?  uh, give me a minute, oh yes, I am .... \"                                             (No coffee. Not at my best.)And then the final embarrassment ... the one that lasts longer than the phone call ... after our two cats have been pealed off whatever ceiling they were clinging to, they walk around the house like they are trying to dodge snipers!!I guess they heard the horn.I will be glad when my two legged and four legged family members get home on Sunday and life returns to its normal noisy state."},
{"title": "Completely and forever ... 37 years ago.", "date": "Wednesday, September 15, 2010", "text": "Today is my son's birthday.  He is 37!  I marvel that 37 years have passed so quickly, that I had a second child after his difficult birth, that I am old enough to be the mother of someone who is 37, and that I managed to create two such wonderful people as my son and daughter (well, I guess I didn't do it single-handedly but for purposes of this discussion - let's just say that I did!)    Ok, ok, that was selfish.  My kids are lucky enough to have a father who loves and cares for them for the whole of their lives, and a phenomenal extended family that provided the perfect cocoon to support and develop happy and healthy human beings.But I can speak only for myself in commenting on parenthood. I always knew I would be a mother!  Always!  It is interesting that some people have just the opposite understanding.  Children are not part of their future, and unless an accident happens or they marry someone who feels strongly about having children, they do not reproduce.  But for me ... always, always, always ... kids were part of my life's plan.  And looking back over 37 years, I would do it all again.What I couldn't understand in advance ... what no one can understand without walking this path, was how having a child changes your life completely and forever!  Those 2 simple words just don't seem to really make the impact they should.  \"Completely ... Forever\"  Maybe if I bold, enlarge, italicize and capitalize all the letters.COMPLETELY ... FOREVER!No, that doesn't do it either.  There are no words to express the change that floods over you when you are handed your newborn child.  You know instantly that the focus of your life has just changed as dramatically and permanently as if you were physically lifted off the planet Earth and placed on Jupiter. I've heard it said that having a child is like having your heart beat outside your body. Those words come close to the experience of giving birth, raising and letting go of your child.  And the \"letting go\" ... it is harder than the childbirth. I'd like to think that my husband and I did everything right, and that is why we have such wonderful people as our kids.  That would be a lie.  Parents make mistakes.  All parents!  I remember a number of my own failings in parenting, and I am sure that my kids could name a some I forgot.  Parents are humans and humans aren't perfect.  I have always said that raising children is like walking through a mine field.  Some of us make it without being blown up, and some of us don't.  Thank you God for letting my two kids make it to the other side in one piece.  And, son, I am so very proud of the man you have become.  Happy Birthday! Love you always - completely and forever,MomPS - and yes, my baby girl, I love you always - completely and forever -  too. ."},

With the winding path, it sort of looks like a greeting card!Another wonderful day for a walk.  It was overcast and cool, with the sun promised to burn off the cloud cover by noon.  I walked for about 75 minutes this morning. As I walked the sun began to show itself.  And that walk poured tons of energy into me.Today was also graced by having coffee with one of my knitting friends.  We met at Starbucks and the time seemed to pass so quickly I couldn't believe it was almost 2:30 when we parted.  It is wonderful to develop a friendship from a common interest and then discover that our lives in many ways have been parallel, and as such, we instantly understood each other's life experiences and difficulties.  It was a fun visit and I look forward to another in the future.After lunch I dropped by a local store to purchase a new shower curtain.  My afternoon was to be filled with vacuuming and dusting the upper level and a major cleaning of our master bath.  Instead of cleaning our shower curtain, I decided to just pitch it and buy another.  Somehow a new shower curtain makes the bathroom seem much cleaner.  Actually, I would love to just pitch the whole dirty bathroom - and put in a new clean one, but I am sure I couldn't sell that idea to my husband - a shower curtain is cheap alternative.By 5:30 pm I had finished my house cleaning for the day (more to-dos tomorrow) - and was able to take a shower in my clean bathroom.  I hate cleaning bathrooms, but I love using a clean one.I felt very energized from my walk this morning, so the rest of the day I just seemed to be brimming with energy.  That morning walk is like a double shot of espresso.  I remember 2 years ago the same thing happened.  If I started the day with a 60-90 minute walk, the rest of the day was extremely productive.  If I didn't do that walk early, I needed a nap in the afternoon.  It is amazing how responsive my body is to exercise!!Hope your Monday was just as full!"},

But this morning I couldn't go back to sleep.  I was restless like the way I get just before I travel. However, this time I wasn't me ... my kids were traveling.  It seems that lately any little thing can disturb my sleep even if it doesn't directly impact me. I didn't go downstairs until 7:00 am as my daughter and Milo were sleeping in the living room, and I didn't want to disturb their sleep too - especially with such a busy day ahead of them.  God keep them safe on this wet travel day ... actually keep all my family safe on this wet travel day.Over the last few days I have developed quite a large to-do list of things I would like to get done this week. I promised myself that once the kids left I would stop adding to the list and only work on crossing things off it.  The list has 39 things on it, and as usual, it is far more than I can get done in one week. Some things will take up a whole day and some are pretty short. But I am going to make a game out of it and see just how many things can be completed.  Here are the rules:The week goes from Sunday the 12th (today) through Sunday the 19th.If I start a task and don't finish, but didn't anticipate finishing (like photo album work, or casting on Milo's sweater), then it counts as done for the week.If I start a task and don't finish, but did plan to finish (like walking 5-6 days this week - but only walk 4) then it isn't complete for the week.Fan-tab-u-lous Achievement would be marking off 33 or more items.  Reward for Fan-tab-u-lous Achievement?  No idea. Probably just feel good that I got so much done.Let the game begin!Today no matter how I tried, my mood was unhappy!  So after lunch I decided (no, forced) myself to take my walk.  It was  rainy and cool, and for half the walk I was wet from the knees down and from the neck up.  I finally gave up trying to keep the hood up ... just threw it back and let my wet hair get wetter.  Here are some of the pictures of my \"Search for Fall\".Early tree changesEven bushes can change to the most vibrant colors.So do what do you see here?  Look very close.Can you see it now?  The most perfect spider web.  Without the rain and the right angle, it would have been invisible.And, yes, I am good now.  I could tell half way through the walk that I was doing better.I am ready for the rest of the week."},

My sister and her family, my kids, my cousin, the grand-dogs ... they all abandon me this week, and I always feel a little stranded at home.What is funny is that although I haven't been able to make this trip for a few years, the week didn't have an actual name until a few days ago.  A friend and I were making plans to have coffee together.  We hadn't seen much each other for a few months - she had been going through some difficult family losses.  I shared my dilemma with her - the one week out of 52 that I get down, because it is beach week and I am not at the beach.  And she said ...  self pity. \"Self Pity!\".  Yes, I said.  That's it!!  I could have kissed her, but we were talking by email, and even in person that might have been construed as strange.   She said I could blog about it as long as I didn't wallow in it!I love my friends!This year, however, I am taking a different approach!  Well ... actually, I want to take a different approach! I am going to focus on the free time I have, enjoy the fun things I can do, I am going to walk and walk and walk, and hope that time passes by quickly.  I am also not going to watch all the ga-zillions of people outside who are walking their dogs. Last year I seriously considered walking up to a few strangers and paying them money to hand over their leashes so I could walk their dogs!!  Would you hand your dog over to a stranger who has the look of someone seeking a fix (a \"dog fix\"), and who is handing out money so they can walk your dog??  And I am not going to flood my family with daily emails while they are on vacation  - written as if the email was created by my grand dog, Meathead - who hates the beach and would prefer to stay home with his grandma that week.  Each email I sent as Meathead to his papa got more and more desperate about missing his Grandmother.  No!  Not this year!!  I am going to do it differently. I am going to walk and walk and walk.  I am going to cope with this week in an adult fashion, stoically, with dignity and in the company of Johnny ...  Johnny Walker, my brand of scotch.PS - In defense of my family, I am always invited to go to the beach. I don't go because mom can't travel that far and doesn't desire to go anymore.  Leaving her home is out of the question.  And my husband (who hates the beach) doesn't drive anymore so leaving him stranded at home doesn't feel right either, and Max, our cat, needs his fluids every other day for kidney failure and that is a two person job without question (sometimes it feels like a 6 person job, but we couldn't fit that many people into our bathroom).  So maybe \"abandon\" is a bit over-dramatic on my part.Maybe the one who is doing the \"leaving\" is me."},
{"title": "# 8 Be passionate about your passions", "date": "Friday, September 10, 2010", "text": "I am enthusiastic about my pasttimes.  Passionate is a good word for it. Passionate about my passions. Something catches my eye and I just need to do it.  I think having hobbies and/or interests keeps you young in spirit, engaged with life and people, mentally sharp - all the things we start out life doing without thinking.  But hobbies are not part of all lives.  Some are so focused on their careers that there isn't time for anything else.  I did that crazy behavior for 5 years before I realized that I didn't like the person I had become.  I quit making the job the focus of my life and took up knitting.  Knitting will never be far from my side because it made me sane when I needed help. For some, interests slip away as they age.  That has happened to my mother. Other than reading, she shows little interest in filling her time with anything besides TV game shows and tracking the weather.  Until this year I can say that knitting and my beloved grand-dogs have filled my life.  But this year I got restless.  I needed something new. So, in keeping with my passionate response to things, in the last 6 months I added 5 new interests to my life (keeping the first two, of course). The pictures reflect activities that I haven't pictured in this blog yet.   iPad and game addiction.   There are adventure games with characters that you play and stats that you improve, dragons that you kill, treasures that you find, goals that you achieve.   Come on ... you haven't lived until you have killed at level 30 Demon Seed with massive fangs dripping with blood and one burning eye that sees into your soul, and stands 20 feet tall with massive armour ... beat him single handedly in an awsome battle of wits and skill and lots of healing potions!!  Of course, if that is not your style, some games are strange but satisfying - like We Rule and We Farm.  In both you create your own little world, buy buildings and farm land, plant and harvest crops, collect rents, increase fortunes, and expand your dwelling, your lands, your businesses. There are no Demon Seeds there!  Really, if anyone had told me a year ago that I would be playing this kind of game I would have asked you what you were smoking.  IPad apps should come with a warning label as being hazardous to the rest of your life.  Steve Jobs - shame on you!Weave-Its:  I was introduced to this little loom by my friend HappyOne and I blogged about it a few days ago. I have a fascination with weaving ever since I saw a full size loom in use on a visit to Maine several years ago.  The loom filled a small bedroom-size space.  I decided that I couldn't house such a large hobby, but when I saw this hand held loom and the beautiful fabric it produced, I was hooked. And I have this failing - if the item is rare or hard to get, the challenge to get one becomes part of the appeal.  They stopped making these looms in the 1950s.  I was not detered. I am happily making these little squares and look forward to having my own blanket made out of left over yarn - of which I have a ton (another failing).Walking:  I have a long history of walking, but stopped 2 years ago because of my stupid feet.  They are better now, but gettng back to walking seemed like a chore.  Thanks to HappyOne, I was able to see my walks through different eyes and have returned to the enjoyment of this simple activity.Spinning:  My cousin introduced me to spinning.  Seeing her beautiful yarn creations finally roped me into buying a spinning wheel.  Although I haven't been active doing this now, the desire is still there.  I have the wheel, I have the desire and I have the roving - now I need the time.Blogging.  OK, it's HappyOne again!!  Yes, I discovered her blog and decided that I should try that too.  I love writing and was paid to write in the past.  Now I do it for the pure joy of writing.  HappyOne, if you do any other activites that I don't know about yet, please keep them a secret until 2011. I am full up right now.  :-)And I am still knitting.  I can't stop that because I have the equivalent of a small yarn store in my yarn stash.  I may even need to add that stash into my will. And besides, knitting is my soul mate.  When I can manage it,  I read.  That and my granddogs who when they are here demand my full attention! It is a busy, busy life.  I love it.Now, when I can get God to take me seriously about extending the day from 24 to 36 hours, I would like to add 2 more things to my list.  As a young person, I discovered that I have a talent for drawing.  Certainly the artist in me is not anywhere near as strong or as developed as it is for my cousins.  But it is gift that I never developed (which I am sure I will hear about when I reach the Pearly Gates).  I just might be able to squeeze this activity into my next 20 years, but NOT in 2010.And a friend suggested that I might like Genealogy.  That idea does intrigue me, but I also know it is a \"hobby\" that can suck all the oxygen and hours out of your day and then some. But my son did start the process going several years ago on an on-line family tree site.  We'll see.So, those are my passions - and it is a major 20 year goal to keep them all juggled without dropping one!You know, I didn't \"work\" this hard when I had a job!!  ;-)"},
{"title": "A Glorious Day to be Outside", "date": "Thursday, September 9, 2010", "text": "A glorious day for a walk.  Absolutely sensational.  It was 65 degrees when I stepped out the door this morning at 9:20 am.  No humidity, a wonderful breeze, no clouds - and for a change it was so cool that I could walk without dodging the sun the whole time.  I walked for 75 minutes and could have gone longer but duty called at home.  The picture on the right shows a lovely walk I take with the dogs that is right behind my townhouse complex.  We have walked that path tons of times.  The dogs love it - good smells back there!  :-)The weather today was so perfect that mom and I made a short trip to our local farm stand.  This time I took pictures and I even had the owner take a picture of mom and I together.  She can't make long trips because it tires her out, but a visit to the farm stand is always fun for both of us.And the weather into next week looks like more of the same!!  I can hear the siren's call of Fall.  Next week - when I have a little more time ('cause my grand dogs will be enjoying a week at the beach) ... I will get in my car and find new areas to walk around.  When time is an issue, I hate to spend time driving to a walk - then walking - and then driving back.  It is one of the many reasons why I don't join a gym or athletic club.  But next week the weather appears to be wonderful, I will have more time and my walking times are increasing.  I am ready for new scenery!"},
{"title": "A few words from Soren ...", "date": "Wednesday, September 8, 2010", "text": "\"Above all do not lose your desire to walk.  Everyday I walk myself into a state of well being and walk away from every illness.  I have walked myself into my best thoughts and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it.  But by sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill ...if one keeps on walking everything will be alright.\"-   Soren Kierkegaard.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Søren_KierkegaardI discovered this quote today and thought it was very representative of how walking helps me. I knew the name of this man but not much else.  So I turned to the \"source of all web knowledge\", Wikipedia, and found this picture of him.  Apparently he was a Danish philosopher, theologian, writer and psychologist.  He died in 1855 at the age of 42. Young by today's standards, but probably not so unusual in the 1800s.  What struck me was that he commented on the value of walking even then - when walking places was more common than it is today.  The other thing that struck me was - cute hair cut!!Today will be a day of rest from walking (despite the walking quote).  I started the day very early by dropping off my car for service.  Once you get over 100,000 miles on a vehicle, missing a routine service is the worst thing you can do.  I plan to attend Tai Chi class this afternoon and visit the Library to get some books being held for me.  With no poochies today, I am just hanging around the house doing fun stuff until my car is ready.  I should be vacuuming and picking up, but I am saving that \"fun\" stuff for next week when the dogs are all on vacation with their owners.  Next week will be a dog-free week, so I hope to \"really party-it-up\" by steam cleaning the rugs and the couch, washing the floors, weeding the back yard, decluttering a few disaster hard-hat areas in my house, and updating more of my family photo albums.  Do I know how to have fun or what!  I wonder what Soren would have to say about housecleaning. Oh ... that's right, he probably had servants."},
{"title": "Observations on Competition", "date": "Tuesday, September 7, 2010", "text": "The competitive spirit is an interesting human emotion.  Successful professionals have a high level of it.  In the extreme, professional athletes survive in their sport only by competition.  In the past I liked to compete, be first, be the best.  As I have gotten older, I find I prefer to watch more than compete. But some of the old me is still there.  I am very competitive with myself.  I really like to improve and show progress. To keep motivated, I joined two competitions on Walker Tracker.com. Competitions are based on step totals during a set period of time.  Logging steps on the site is based on the honor system - no one checks on what you report.  Sometimes there is a small reward, like a gift card, Walker Tracker points or cookies.  Usually the reward is just the knowledge that you placed first. It is all for fun.The first competition was \"Walking the Grand Canyon\" and yesterday it ended.  HappyOne finished in first place many, many thousands of steps ahead of 2nd place. I was shooting for second place and last night that is where I was (shocking!).  The person in 3rd looked like he had logged his steps for the day and he was about 2,000 steps behind me.  I went to bed thinking that I made 2nd place.  Unfortunately, this morning, I had dropped to 3rd place.  Sometimes extra steps are added later in the evening, when a walker's day is truly over. I am happy with third.esknitter Steps: 76,547 Place: 3The second competition, \"Walking Cornwall\" continues until September 10th. I've been as close as 20th place and as far away at 47th place out of 68 participants.  The group has some power walkers in it (who average 15,000 steps or more a day).  I believe I will finish midrange and I'll be happy with that.esknitter Steps: 181,589 Place: 36Now 10 years ago, I might have felt differently.  I would have walked nonstop, demanding a \"recount\" when I fell behind PoconoGreg - a super power walker who averages 45,000-47,000 steps a day - everyday, for as far back as I could look in Walker Tracker.  That man must never sleep, must eat while walking, must have a catheter so he doesn't ever have to stop at the men's room!!  His Walker Tracker Blog shows that he spends 3 hours a day on his treadmill (along with other walks).  Think on that a few minutes ... 3 hours a day on a treadmill, where the scenery never changes, there are no casual hellos with other local walkers, no views of the sky or the local wildlife.  Maybe he has TV to help pass the time, but we all know that TV rots the brain if watched too much. But ten years ago he would have eaten my dust!!  Beat'en the pants off him!  Sure, I would need hospitalization after 2 days of that, but still ... been first in step counts, number 1, lead dog, superwoman, leader of the country, dictator of the universe ..., uh ... I think I just blacked out there for a moment!"},
{"title": "Labor Day Reflections", "date": "Monday, September 6, 2010", "text": "Today is Labor Day. The weekend has been beautiful - perfect, perfect weather.  It could only be more perfect if it was a fall or winter day.  My walk today was between 2:00 and 3:00 - usually too hot a time to walk.  If I am not listening to a podcast or a book on tape, I find my mind wanders ... settling on one topic or another.I couldn't help but note that holidays seem to lose importance or specialness now that I am retired.  We are not big holiday celebrators in our family, but when I was working - holidays were little jewels in the calendar - jewels of no work, a day of rest, do fun stuff.  Now that I don't have a job, those jewels aren't so shiny as they once were. This is a small loss for sure, because the benefit of not working is more freedom.  I do have more freedom now than when I was working, but not as much as I imagined.  My \"work\" now doesn't really take holidays.I am happy to find us now in September.  I am very much a fall and winter person.  I totally love cool to cold weather.  I look forward to being able to take my walk any time of the day without regard to heat and humidity.  And I very much hope that since I am walking an hour a day now, the fall and winter walks can be longer.  The most colorful season is approaching - nothing beats the beauty of fall colors.  And I think I appreciate fall and winter even more after living through summer.  The change of seasons is so wonderful.I am also very very lucky to live in a neighborhood with so many shady areas to walk.  I am a shade-worshiper.  The sun and I aren't friends - I get too hot and sweaty and I get brown sun spots now on my skin (a function of previous sun damage). I will go way out of my way to keep to shady areas when I walk.  Some of the pictures in this post are from my walk today.  I am very fortunate as well to live in a city that created walking paths into nearby wooded areas.  There are miles of them.  I seldom take those paths by myself - preferring to stick to the neighborhood sidewalks.  Some of the paths take you though beautiful woods but are very isolated.  But today I took one of these side paths - one that I knew passed by the backs of many houses.  It was beautiful.I couldn't help from reflecting happily on how quickly my body has responded to walking again and how quickly I was able to walk for an hour.  I returned to walking regularly the end of July.  In less than 2 months I am back to my previous times of two years ago - before my feet checked out and sidelined me.  The report on the new running shoes is mixed.  My feet aren't totally pain free while walking, but they return to normal almost immediately after the walk.  I am thinking that there is an adjustment period since the structure of these shoes are so very different from walking shoes.I had the dogs this holiday.  Since we don't do much celebrating, it was fun to have their furry personalities here over the long weekend.  And my daughter also came making it a very wonderful weekend indeed.  As you can see from this picture, the dogs have bonded pretty well.  Milo has his quiet times now and when that happens, they are a happy three-some.And sometimes it is good to leave those ear buds, iPod and podcasts at home.  It is helpful to give your brain a chance float from topic to topic and discover just how good your life is on the whole."},
{"title": "How to ruin a perfect walking day.", "date": "Saturday, September 4, 2010", "text": "You can't get more beautiful weather than we are having today!  Some sun, few clouds, 75 degrees, little or no humidity.  It was a grand day for a walk.  But half way through this perfect day and exercise walk, my feet began to bother me.  Not my heels (I have prescription orthotics for those) but the balls of my feet.  Very annoying.  I decided it was probably time for new shoes.   For years we have purchased shoes at Van Dyke and Bacon Shoes.  They are excellent. Their claim to fame is that physicians send their diabetic patients to this store for shoe fitting.  In addition to excellent fitting knowledge, they carry very well made shoes.  And that means that a visit to this establishment is a very expensive trip for us.  But having lived with foot pain in the past, I can tell you that money is no object if you can walk pain free.At this point the day began to slip some.  Slip #1 - After describing my problem and sizing my foot, the sales woman says (with a straight face):  \"You know, as we get older the cushioning at the bottom of our feet gets thin.\"  And off she walks to bring back shoe choices - leaving me to ponder the full scope of her comment. Hmm ... \"as we get older\" - OK, next time ...  make-up.  I am definately wearing make-up next time I come!  I may even put alittle blush on my feet!  Slip #2 \"bottoms of our feet gets thin\" - Technically she never looked at the bottom of my feet.  But if this is true, this appears to be a design flaw in the human body - the bottoms of our feet get thin as we age and all other areas plump up. What's with that!!  What was God thinking?  Maybe it is his idea of a joke.  Anyway, I digress.  Slip #3 - After trying on all my choices, I made an expensive decision. I chose running shoes for my offical walking shoes.  The running shoes had the best cushioning and were very light weight (and, of course, they cost $30 more than my already expensive walking shoes.)  Slip #4 - I decided to get the regular walking shoes as well.   I have very expensive feet.  Probably the most expensive part of me - other than my teeth (don't get me started on that).Now some might question - why would I buy 2 pairs of shoes when conceivably one pair could work for both functions.  The answer should be obvious.  The running shoes are \"decorated up\" - ugh.  Color stripes, silvery accents, sometimes day-glow markings, netty tops, all designed to make you think you are a running speed demon while glowing in the dark.  I couldn't wear something like that all day long!  The real question should be - why don't running shoes come in plain white?  And besides, the running shoes may last longer if I only wear them for an exercise walk.  I can justify anything. :-)What will really frost me in the extreme is ... if after this large expense (and the soul searching on age and thin feet), I don't have happy feet tomorrow when I walk. That would aggravate me more than stupid shoe decoration.Note to feet:  I have treated you very, very well today.  I iced you down.  You got a massage.  I spent enough on you to feed a family of 12 in a third world country for a year.  We have 20 years of walking ahead of us.  So keep up!"},
{"title": "#7 Declutter and \"stuff\"", "date": "Thursday, September 2, 2010", "text": "My mother is a minimalist.  She saves things long past their useful life, and avoids buying stuff.  Frequently I discover 2 tablespoons of juice in a gallon container in my refrigerator or 6 nuts in a large empty box in my pantry.  She wastes nothing, and she doesn't want to be the last one to use it up.  She grew up during the Depression, and during her adult life, she didn't have all that much either. I have tried to explain the difference between \"need\" and \"want\".  She doesn't  understand \"want\" - only \"need\" carries any weight with her.  So the minimalist pattern of behavior is probably part of her DNA after 84 years.  I've given up trying to change that.I was not any of those things.  While it is true that we didn't have much growing up, I was part of the Baby Boomer generation.  Baby Boomers were raised during a period of growing prosperity and consumerism, an explosion of non-essential goods and services aggressively advertised as critical to a happy life, and a rising standard of living.  We Baby Boomers view the world through different eyes than our parents. Our homes typically are filled with stuff - lots and lots of \"stuff\".  And these homes are not the small 2-3 bedroom ranchers of our parents.  They are typically large homes with many more bedrooms than needed, 2 and 3 car garages that do not hold cars, and tons of closet space.   And, as our American culture seems to require, if you can't store all your \"stuff\" within the walls of your home, you can rent space in a storage facility to store the \"spill-over stuff\".  Clutter is a natural evolution of too much \"stuff\".My house is no exception. I don't use rental space to store stuff.  I manage to squeezing it all into my abode.  But it hasn't been easy.  Prior to the 1990's I was a major collector of stuff - you know, being a good baby boomer and all.  We raised 2 kids and they had their stuff too. Over the last 20 years five different family members have downsized, relocated, and move in with us at different times.  In three of those instances their stuff permanently resided in my town home.  Prior to each move, I decluttered my stuff to make room for their stuff.  When I think back across the years to all the stuff that passed through my hands - it makes me dizzy.And so ... my stuff is plucking my last nerve!!  For example - This evening I was trying to close a kitchen drawer.  This drawer holds all the \"critical stuff\" I use when I cook (NOT! the only critical thing I have in my kitchen is my microwave!!). Anyway, this drawer with \"critical stuff\" wouldn't close.  I shoved the drawer with my hip.  A pastry cutter tried to escape.  For gosh sakes!!!  What was I doing with a pastry cutter? When did I ever cut pastry?  What was I thinking when I bought it?  I pitched it the trash.  I slammed at the draw again, it still didn't close.  Now I was really annoyed.  This time the wine bottle opener made a break for it (thankfully reason took hold - can't throw that away!!!), so I opened the stupid drawer with a flourish and began pitching stuff.  Five other things hit the trash.  I had no idea what two of them even were!!! But they are now history! (and the drawer now closes.)  :-)Stuff is adding stress to my life.  Decluttering stuff is a 20 year goal! Maybe mom has it right!As a side note:  I recently bought a magazine about decluttering stuff. How stupid is that!  I added stuff, to my stuff, so I could declutter stuff! Apparently my DNA is wired to \"add stuff\".  After flipping through the $7 magazine at home, I tossed it.  It was more into re-organizing stuff than getting rid of it.  A total waste.Another side note:  The pictures used in this posting are real.  They are not doctored or staged!  See how I love my readers!!"},
{"title": "Mini Walking Update", "date": "Wednesday, September 1, 2010", "text": "So I am sitting here at about 8:30 pm with my feet on ice and Advil in my stomach.  I wasn't going to walk today, but HappyOne reminded me that this was Day 1 of the Grand Canyon Race - I couldn't rest today.  So up I got and put 45 minutes on the treadmill.  It was a slow walk but at least I broke 10,000 steps.Today I checked my stats on 2 walking competitions I entered through WalkerTracker.com.A Walk Through Cornwall - I am in 37th place now but I am sure I will slip since it is early in the evening and not everyone has entered their totals for today.  I do seem to be falling in the middle of the pack consistently.A Walk of the Grand Canyon - Since I entered my totals early I am in 2nd place on this race.  Now with 12,000 + steps only - and the fact that it is early, I sincerely doubt I will hold onto that position.  For example - at 2:00ish today, HappyOne was about around 17,000 or maybe it was 19,000 steps - can't remember, but she was \"trucken\". As long as I finish in the middle of the pack or better on these 2 I will consider myself a winner.  I just started back to walking a little over a month ago - some of these people have been walking for a long time - like HappyOne.  The race is on for them.  As long as I am in the race I am content - at least for a few months.I updated the \"Soap Box\" Tab today for those who follow that page.The rant for September is Housekeeping.  I used the word \"hate\" so much that I had to get out a Thesaurus to find other words. :-)I updated by Exercises and Report Card pages.  In the future, that is where exercise stats and updates will be listed.  No sense cluttering up the body of the blog with stuff that would probably be of interest to only me! But if curious, click those tabs.  Those pages are still in development so they will probably change over time.Today will be a \"rest the feet\" day - so no walk. Yesterday was a big step total for me - over 15,000 steps, but little reminders from my feet are telling me to take it slow today.  We have many places to go - starting with a trip to get a haircut.  I always call my hair cuts - Face Lift Days.  :-)Enjoy your Wednesday - this is the only Wednesday, September 1, 2010 - you are ever going to have!  Make it a good one."},

At 63 I kind of thought I knew everything, so finding out about this little gizmo and then finding out that I was pretty much the last person in my knitting group who was clueless about a Weave-It was stunning to me!  Apparently everyone (except me) played with this little loom as a child.  I think I must have been deprived!Anyway, one of my friends, Happy One, was working on this little loom and recently showed off a beautiful blanket made from the little squares the loom makes.  She was making it from left over yarn.  And then I found an article in a magazine that featured the loom, the history and value of items made from a Weave-It.  I had to have one - and the fact they aren't making them anymore didn't deter me one bit. I just had to have one now!!  Turns out original ones from the 50s can be found on the secondary market, but eBay had a seller who made them - on a \"Buy it now\" purchase!  Click!

We met through our husbands - who worked together.  Over the years we have visited frequently enjoying each others company and sharing our lives - jobs, our children, their growing pains, school experiences, their marriages, and grandchildren ... all the events of life.  We continue to see each other a couple of times a year and sometimes even our adult kids join us - we must be doing something right if they choose to join us in a visit.  And sometimes ... just us girls get together, like today.  It is special to have these kinds of friends.I typically avoid using names in my blog, but Gerri has given me permission to do so.  Gerri Bowen is the lady standing behind us.  She is a published author.  As long as I have known her she has been interested in writing and publishing stories.  And she has been successful!  If you are interested or curious, please check out her web site at the following link.http://www.gerribowen.com/Wednesday, August 25th (last week) was the last day that I was able to take my one hour walk.  Today I pushed myself out the door first thing this morning.  It was definitely a \"push\" because my body was sending me messages saying something like \"Are you kidding me?  Walk for an hour?  Wouldn't it be better to check your email over a cup of coffee?\"  It was astounding to me that I resisted walking this morning.  For weeks I looked forward to my walks.  Couldn't wait to get out the door. Not this morning.Ten minutes into my walk I found myself enjoying it once again.  Lesson:  Don't allow a 4 day gap in walking.  The body \"forgets\" and undermines you.And if I had missed this morning's walk, I would have missed the first signs of fall.  I drive past this tree almost every day - but who would have seen the beauty of fall peeking through the green if they were only driving by.And what great stuff did I miss the last 4 days?"},
{"title": "Goal Setting and Soul Searching", "date": "Saturday, August 28, 2010", "text": "This posting will be a bit dry so I thought a cheery picture would brighten it up a bit.  So this is \"A View from my Walk\" picture - and it just proves that not all beauty and color in nature comes from flowers!I am nearing the end of the first month of this 20 year journey, and plan to look back and see how things are going around September 1st - but how to do that!  Six goals out of 20 are published and without some method of review, it is just a list!Realistic goal setting for me has always been hard. Oh, yes, I can set goals easily and I love to set goals and make to-do lists, but I have the \"eyes-are-bigger-than-my-stomach\" syndrome - I set big goals and lots of them ... goals that usually aren't realistic in light of limited time.  I am a Type A personality - I like to be the best, achieve the most, and control all the processes (i.e. do things without help and delegate almost never).  I don't think these are positive traits anymore, but they have been part of me for as long as I can remember. As I have gotten older, I have given up some stupid stuff - my house isn't perfect and not always clean.  I am not going for the slimmest body and I try very hard to not \"lead\" (having done that for a number of professional years.)  But I do need sort through what can be tracked and what will be assumed.Let's start with the easy ones!Walking - this is pretty simple.  Use a pedometer and improve the daily average steps each month.  The starting goal is 10,000 steps average. That should work for awhile - until the daily step totals average 15,000 steps (or whatever number seems like a stretch).  Then it is just a matter of keeping it up.  Wa-la!! That was easy!  I am doing great, don't you think? :-) (I think Type A's like to hear that they are doing well - so yes, I am fishing for compliments.)Tai Chi and Stretching - this is pretty simple, too.  Count the time and improve it each month. And this month, I did such a lousy job of keeping up with Tai Chi and I did no stretching.  It won't be hard to do better next month. I would assume that these 2  would also reach a certain plateau, just like walking, and then just maintaining.  I'll still need to figure out where that plateau is. (Type A's like to set themselves up for success - so I did bad this month so I can do better next month - yes, that works for me.)Keep Learning - now things are getting harder.  I have enthusiastically invited 3 things into my life this month that weren't there last month.  So maybe if I blog about what I have done with these things for this year, maybe 3 times a month, I will at least show continuity. The downside is that I've invited 3 things in this month, but done nothing with them.  More thinking, more thinking.Photo Family History - this is a long term, episodic goal.  Over the last few years I have worked on this project during a September beach week.  Beach week is when my kids and my sister's family go to the Outer Banks.  I used to go on this trip, but mom can't make it comfortably, doesn't really want to go anymore and my husband doesn't drive so I don't feel comfortable leaving them behind without back up when I would be 6 hours away.  So if I work on this project once a year during beach week, it counts.  Friendships and Family - these are not objective elements.  And up to now, they have been part of my life like breathing.  I see family several times a week and friends socially every week, and email others.  My blogging should be evidence of my commitment.  I think these can be assumed to be valued at a high level already.So, the initial sort of where I am going and how I will assess my progress is done for now.  I will be back around September 1 to look at this again.  I can tell you right now - I have earned an F in some of this!  Type A's don't get F's ... maybe I can consider this a \"growth\" opportunity as I force myself to relax into a Type B personality.  No ...  I am still a Type A.   An \"F\" can't be translated into a \"growth opportunity\" no matter how you look at it!"},
{"title": "Walking vs sitting and the Road Trip", "date": "Friday, August 27, 2010", "text": "Another missed walk.  I missed my Tai Chi practice this morning.  The day was beautiful, sunny, cool, perfect for Tai Chi in the park and a long walk.  But my body vetoed both since I slept until 8:30 am - unusual. I guess this was to be expected. I haven't slept well for several days this week. And there was no time left after getting mom breakfast to fit either in as other tasks were waiting.On my 45 minute trip into the city to get Milo I had some time to ponder the question of sitting vs walking. It occurred to me - I sit alot.  I sit in the car - driving dogs to their destinations, driving mom or my husband to the store or the doctors or the pharmacy or church, and sometimes driving myself to fun stuff.  I sit for my hobbies: knitting, spinning, reading, movies, blogging, iPad games, TV - every single activity I sit.  So getting steps into my day is tough.  Missing my walk - the step count is  embarrassing.Now that I wear a pedometer all day, I can see how sedentary I am at times.  The pedometer used correctly is an objective measure of how much movement I do each day. You can't really cheat the pedometer, unless you take it off and shake it, but then you are really just cheating yourself! I looked at the step equivalents for various activities on About.com.  They had a huge list of activities and the step equivalents.  You know, activities like swimming, biking, dancing, kick boxing, Tai Chi, and such.  These activities raise your heart rate, count as exercise, but do not accurately reflect on a pedometer.  One activity listed was sitting.  Yes, I said \"sitting\".  For every minute you sit, you can count 30 steps.  uhh ...  Really??  Can you look in the mirror at yourself and honestly say that 30 steps worth of effort was expended by sitting for a minute?? The car trip to Milo's house was uneventful.  Here is a picture of the sweet little guy who waiting for me to open his crate at my daughter's house - I am sure he was thinking ... \"uh ... Grandma, what is wrong with this picture - I am in the crate, you aren't, and I shouldn't be here either now, grandma.  Let's get the door open please.\"  And then I did after about 3 pictures - you know I had to get settings and focus and lighting just right ;-)Anyway, I let him ride on the front seat on the way home - he has grown and matured and is not such a crazy boy anymore.  Here is photographic evidence of that.  (And no, I wasn't driving when I took this picture ... well, not much.)And the traffic was busy on the interstate, but moving at least (I had to wrestle the camera away from Milo - he loves to take pictures.)And as we were driving down a street in our neighborhood and onto our home street, he was just snapping pictures left and right! He is such a photo-bug!\"Finally at Grandma's.  It was a photo-fun trip.\" said MiloAfter lunch, I went to get Meaty and Grimmy.  They will be spending the weekend with me while their papa goes to his campsite in southern Maryland.  And after dinner, Milo's mama will be coming to spend the night.  A full day of family and pets - some days you can't squeeze in a walk no matter what your plans.  But sitting? ... Sitting always find a way to be part of my day.Need to find a creative way to change that balance!As of 2:45 pm - step count is 3274!  Pathetic!As of 8:10 pm - step count is 5545!  Still pathetic!And the \"sitting step count\"? - well I put 115 miles on my car today.  The traffic was terrible and slow so I probably average about 40 miles per hour.  That is about 3 hours of driving or 180 minutes sitting ... times 30 steps per minute = 5400 steps for just sitting in the car. Nope, I still can't do it."},
{"title": "#6 - Friendships", "date": "Thursday, August 26, 2010", "text": "Life without friendships is like an uncut diamond.  Yes, it is still a diamond - but it doesn't have the sparkle or beauty of diamond that is faceted.Why is it that some people have the gift of making friends? All my life I have been blessed with the ability to make friends easily. I wasn't the most popular kid, the smartest student, the prettiest girl, the most well dressed, wealthy, or athletic.  So why was friendship an easy thing for me?  I don't really know, but I am guessing that making real friends isn't based on any of those things. I do have 2 qualities that helped me.  First, even as a child I seemed to have a kind of \"radar\" to avoid people who were not good for me and to cultivate friendships of those who made me more complete.  I don't know were that ability comes from - maybe everyone has it,  but some people may not listen to that small voice of warning.  It has served me well.  Secondly,  I accept all personality types.  I try hard to look beyond the shell of a person and even the persona the person projects to understand why they act in a certain way.  Yes, this takes effort and patience at times. Not every encounter results in a friend, but I do try to understand.  Life shapes us and sometimes it creates protective shells making some friendships not possible.  But I do see it as a challenge to understand.  My best example of this is when I met my husband.  He was, even as a young man, a bit of a hermit with a small circle of friends. I was the opposite.  I was an education major, with a minor in Drama.  Drama - you know what that means - I was outgoing, had tons of friends and not shy at all.  We were very different (and we still are). I met him as a college student working part time in a college print shop.  He was in charge of the printers, and the lady who hired me was in charge of the front processing area.  Prior to introducing me to all the staff, she warned me that he was very quiet and only talked to her.  I should not take it personally.  HA!  I love a challenge!! :-)  Silently (and instantly) I vowed that he would talk to me as well - and not once, but as a regular thing.  We would be friends. I would be part of the small (exclusive) circle of friends. Yes, that is what I would do. In fact I would get him to ask me out!  Yep, that was my goal.  Now I didn't actually plan it out 42 years into the future  - I was only 20 at the time and I only thought about the next 30 minutes or so!  But some friendships just evolve beyond friendship. :-)  And so I am blessed with friends.  There are a few that stand out above the rest, mostly because of their longevity even after long periods of separation.  One woman has been a friend since the age of 6.  We were friends until she went to private high school and I went to public high school.  Fortunately we reconnected in college, and were close friends through our early married years, then drifted apart again, but now as seniors we have \"drifted\" back again.  We share a history that spans our lives.  That is a hard thing to ignore.Another friendship began in an usual way.  I was engaged to be married and I volunteered to teach the equivalent of Sunday School for the year prior to my marriage.  During that time I met a man who was committed to becoming a priest and a friendship sprung up.  I think he said his first mass the same day as my husband and I took our vows.  We couldn't attend each other's important life changing events, but the friendship continued.  Our paths have crossed mostly through email over the years, but we are back in contact again ... just like nothing has changed.  Of course in both these friendships, life has molded and shaped our opinions and they aren't always the same, but the friendships remain ... regardless.  Another friendship was made more than 20 years ago. I met this woman in the workplace.  We worked together, struggled together, suffered together and celebrated together through years working in the same area.  We even competed for the same job - something that would have torn other friendships apart - but we survived it all and even though we have retired into different states, with very different lives, we are still friends.  I miss not seeing her.And now as a senior, I am thrilled beyond measure to find that I still am making friends - my knitting group, my Tai Chi group - these relationships have grown and are evolving, and I am confident that \"friend\" will be the relationship I have with some of these wonderful people.Yes, friendship needs to be part of my next 20 years.  I have watched several of my elderly relatives lose friendships to death, relocations, or just neglect, and fail to build new social circles - allowing their world to shrink.  That won't be me.  It's on my list of 20!!"},
{"title": "Caregiving - an essay on a difficult topic", "date": "Wednesday, August 25, 2010", "text": "I resisted covering the topic of elder care - specifically care of an elderly parent.  It is hard to be objective since I am a caregiver for my mother.  I feel, however, to totally ignore this topic (which is a major part of my life) would be like omitting the color of your hair if someone were giving a description of you. And I do have a perspective to share. So I will comment on it now.Caring for an elderly parent is a slippery slope of declining health, poor decision making, resistance to change (even good stuff like hearing aids or a stair lift), loss of individual control, loss of friendships, loss of mobility, and the worst of all ... sadness - sadness that things aren't the same, can never be the same as they were, and that the roles of parent and child have switched - with you becoming the \"parent\" of your parent.  Sadness and loss.Four years ago I moved my mom into my home.  I had experience caring for 2 elderly relatives previously - inlaws and for short periods of time. I was not a rookie, I thought.  I know the score.  But this time I was caring for my mom and very early on I discovered that my previous experience didn't count for much.  Caring for any elderly parent is one of the hardest and loneliest things you can do.  Before she lived with me, I read several current elder care books, and I have since thrown them all away.   To begin with, they all recommended not inviting an elderly parent into your home.  I was appalled at this view of senior care. This was how it was done for ages (and in some cultures it continues).  I felt strongly that this choice should be a viable one - even if it is the most difficult and complicated one!! I had one nurse friend who also discouraged me from this choice and once even implied that I was stupid for taking this step.  It was a hurtful comment thrown out carelessly and I am sure that was not her intention to cause pain.  And after four years taking care of my mom in  my home I think I understand this point of view better, but as hard as this is, I would have made the same choice again.  At the time I felt she should be living with family, and I still feel that way.  Oh, we did discuss several options - discussed them for 2 years prior to her move here.  But even then red flags were flying.  She couldn't make a decision.  Getting her to seriously consider any move (even though she made motions about doing it) got no where. Lack of decision making was the first red flag. She also had memory issues, and she was getting very frail.  I worried that she had reached the point where others might take advantage of her if she continued to live on her own.  Certainly at the beginning of the discussions, she had many independent options to choose from, but she delayed her decision until she could no longer take advantage of those options and her choices narrowed considerably. Nothing would be gained in the recitation of the things that drive me crazy daily.  But I do have a wish list I would like to share.  If you know someone who is caring for an elderly parent - their list is probably similar.  Wishes are sometimes hard to grant - these wishes are toughies.So here goes.I wish I had more help.  I am surrounded by a wonderful family, but with the exception of my daughter and my husband, no one intimately understands how much of yourself you sacrifice to care for an elderly parent.  Unless you have walked in these shoes, you can't truly understand. It is not my nature to ever ask for help. I believe if you are an adult son or a daughter (or even an adult grandchild) of an elderly parent, some things should be obvious - shouldn't need to be asked of you, shouldn't need reminders. That is what being an \"adult\" means.I wish my mother could have her life back.  She has given up so much.  Her independence, driving which restricts her freedom, control over her meds, control over her health choices, her financial tasks, her friendships, her physical mobility, even her ability to visit others overnight (she can't climb stairs) ... she is so restricted and so much is lost.  While it is true that some of these loses could have been avoided, it doesn't change the fact that they are gone now.  When my mother signed over her car to another family member I thought I would cry.  Yes, she couldn't safely drive any more, and I wanted that car gone from our parking lot so she wasn't tempted ... but still ... I want her to have her life back.I wish I could have my life back.I wish my husband didn't have to deal with these daily frustrations, and I wish that we could have more time - just the two of us - in our own house. Yes, traveling away is fun, but sometimes just being at home is fun too. I wish friends who hold different opinions about senior care would keep those opinions to themselves. If you can't be supportive of an unselfish choice made by your friend, then you really aren't a friend.  You are a judge - Caregivers don't need judges in their lives.I wish the decisions that I am forced to make on my mother's behalf weren't so hard to do at times.I wish she was more supportive of my efforts to help her.I wish I didn't have to be her \"parent\".I wish I wasn't creating a \"wish list\".Mom and I are like cookie cutters of each other physically.  In many ways we are different in attitude, and we are very, very different in our approach to life.  But watching her is sort of like watching me in 20 years - unless I do things differently now. There is one last wish I want to make.10.  I wish that my kids won't be forced into making a wish list in 20 years.  I wish that with all my heart.  I am working on that now.PS - Mom, I love you!"},
{"title": "Cornwall Stroll Update", "date": "Wednesday, August 25, 2010", "text": "A View From My Walk - on a previous day I snapped a picture of a house I pass by frequently.  They always have a light showing in this window and I love the look of it.  So inviting on a gray day!A Stroll Through Cornwall Update and other stuffSo this morning I was 30 in a field of 61 participants - right in the middle of the pack. That is not too bad for me on day 3 of the competition and a slow start (low step counts the first 2 days).  But placement is a very fluid thing in these Walker Tracker competitions.  Sometimes people don't get around to updating their step totals right away - so I could be further back in the pack.But it is fun to participate and it is great fun to watch it play out on an actual map - the course of the walk is shown on a map of Cornwall and each participant's avatar is placed on the course in position based on the number of steps you entered.  In the beginning it was difficult to find me on the map because everyone was bunched together at the start of the walk, but now we are spreading out some and it is a bit easier to see who is who (just like in an actual race you see on TV).  If you are interested in seeing this in action, click on my Walker Tracker link in the right column of my blog and you should be able to find the Competitions section ... just click on through.  I don't think you need to be an actual member to see these competitions.  I did up my membership on this site from Free to Pro.  The Free version is very functional and I had that level for about 2 years.  Pro gives you additional statistics about your walking history and the ability to easily enter non-walking activities (such as Tai Chi) into your step counts.  That is a huge help for folks who do multiple activities - such as swimming or biking or something that doesn't count steps but actually is a work out.  A great site for walkers of any level. And these competitions along with the pedometer itself, really motivate you to keep walking ( hmm ... well it keeps competitive people walking.  I don't want to be at the back of the pack when the competition is done.)   :-)So I didn't sleep too well last night.  Asleep at 1:00 am and up at 6:15 am.  I was too wired up from yesterday.  Today should be less eventful - a walk first thing this morning, shopping with Mike before lunch, a stop to buy dog food, lunch for mom, maybe get mom to the bank, probably a short rest in the early afternoon (I will start crashing with only 5 hours of sleep), and Tai Chi in the afternoon.  And if I am lucky, very lucky, I can squeeze in some knitting.  What I haven't been able to do is squeeze spinning into any days.  My poor new spinning wheel!I wonder how my poor Meaty did last night.  After yesterday, I am keeping my fingers crossed that his sleep was uninterrupted."},
{"title": "Ending the day with a seizure", "date": "Monday, August 23, 2010", "text": "Some days you just can't pack one more thing into it. The day started out pretty nice.  I had a full night's sleep (not always the case).  Today was knitting day with friends and some great projects were shared.  The first picture shows the hem of the project I am working on - Sommelier Sweater by Mary Scott Huff.  It has been slow going because so many other things have gotten in the way, but it is turning out pretty good.The second picture is a beautiful sweater being created by one of my friends.  It is a work of art.I also received a gift of a knitted green book mark with my name on it from one of my knitting buddies.  It is a lovely and thoughtful gift.  I tried to take a picture of it, but I probably need natural light for the best shot.A beautiful afghan made on a Weave-It loom was displayed.  I neglected to get any pictures of this wonderful item, but I didn't neglect to come right home and order myself a Weave-It style loom.  It is a great way to use up all those partial balls of yarn.  The picture belows show an article from PieceWork - a magazine whose focus is fiber arts and the historical aspects.  Weave-It looms stopped being produced in the 1950s, but it is possible to get them on the secondary market or Weave-It style looms - which is what I purchased.After knitting, I went home, washed mom's hair, then I got her lunch.  While she was resting, I took my walk for an hour.  It was a cool day and it felt pretty good to walk in the middle of the day.  Then mom needed a meds refill so we went to the pharmacy followed by a trip to my son's house to get Meaty and Grimace.  The day was still cool and gray so I took the dogs for a long walk.  Then dinner for everyone, and then we took another long walk.Finally, finally, finally ... we sat down to enjoy an evening of TV, knitting, and dog petting, when Meaty had a grand mal seizure at 7:45.  While he is treated for epilepsy and we are experienced at handling this condition, each seizure is upsetting and very hard to watch.  As he was coming out of the seizure, I gave him his rectal Valium (needed to prevent cluster seizures).  Once he was on his feet, the aftermath of a seizure results in about 1 1/2 hours of confused pacing around and panting.  We block all the stairs and doorways so he can't hurt himself while he is in this disoriented state, and I sort of follow him around to be sure he is OK (a grandma would do that).  At 9:30 pm he finally fell asleep at my feet. Poor baby!  Then we made the trip home to his papa (who informed me that Meaty had a seizure last night too). On the way I almost ran into a full size buck (with a full rack) as I was merging onto the highway.  I managed to miss him and his mate who was nearby, but I couldn't help but think that it was all part of the craziness that was today!So it is now 11:15 pm and I am getting my blog posting out. And then it is up the stairs to give Max his fluids for his kidneys - probably around mid-night.  On balance - some good stuff and some bad stuff.  Pretty much a typical unpredictable day for me. Hope your day was more unbalanced - toward good stuff!PS - I signed up for a competition on Walker Tracker.  Last time I checked I was around 64th place.  Today I checked and I am 25th place!  Yeah!  But it is possible that not everyone has logged their steps.  I'll check again tomorrow morning and try not to be too discouraged when I drop to a lower position.  I need to find out how many people are participating as well. Stats below.A stroll through CornwallDistance: 198,600 steps / ~99 milesDays allotted for this walk: 21 daysYou're currently walking at a pace of 9,286/daySteps needed to make it to your destination on time: 9,497/daySevere boredom with walking around my neighborhood set in.  I usually don't like getting in the car to go someplace to walk, but I am going to have to get past that.  After 25 years living here, I am ready for new views.So, this morning my husband and I walked around Lake Elkhorn - twice.  It took an hour.  Come fall we should be able to walk to the lake, then around it and back home in about 90 minutes.  That is my goal when the weather is more agreeable and my fitness levels are higher. I mostly wanted to see how the lake dredging project was coming.  This man-made lake has not had any loving care since it was built.  Development and storm erosion have caused alot of silt build up.  Now millions of dollars are being spent for the restoration.  Other man-made lakes in our city are being dredged or scheduled for dredging because they have suffered the same neglect.Lake Elkhorn is a beautiful lake - shaded paths, benches, a very large playground, various exercise stations and a small pier make it an idea gathering place.  But the pictures I chose were of the lake itself - where there is no reflection on the water, there is a green scum.  Sad.  The lake has the constant hum of big machinery that works 24/7.  In many ways the lake seems abandon by the wildlife and walkers that used to inhabit it.The work is supposed to be completed in December 2010.  Then it should be born again as a gathering place for all living things.My right foot made little \"noises\" during the walk - I had taken Advil before starting (and I was wearing my prescription orthotics) and I am now icing down both feet while I type.  If symptoms persist, no matter how small, I'll be back at the podiatrist again. It has been almost 2 years since I visited him - but I am pretty sure he will remember me ... the \"instant fix\" lady who mentioned \"brain tumors-in-relation-to-her-feet\" lady.  He'll remember. :-)"},
{"title": "A busy weekend and a quiet Sunday night", "date": "Sunday, August 22, 2010", "text": "So here I sit at 8:45 pm adjusting to the quiet, and trying to deal with Wally, our cat, who has missed my undivided attention since Thursday when the 3 granddogs showed up.  Although he makes a point of strutting through the living room when the dogs are here, (letting them know exactly who is the resident and who is the visitor), he doesn't stay long, and he never gets on the couch to sit by me.Maybe Wally is sensing that I am feeling alittle lost by all the quiet and he is trying to \"fill in\". If that's the case, he could stop inserting his claws into my leg, waving his bushy tail across my keyboard and rubbing his chin aggressively against the screen.  Or maybe he just wants me to stop typing and pay attention to him since he is bored by all the quiet.  Knowing Wally, it is most likely option 2.  He is not the most sensitive cat, but he is one of the smartest.  And smart pets can make for bored pets.  Yes, I sincerely doubt that he cares if I am missing the dogs.   Ahhh, finally he has curled up by my side and the slightest of purrs can be heard.  And now little licks to the hand ... maybe I will keep him after all. ;-)The weekend was filled with family and friends and pets.  I often wonder why I book activities back to back on weekend days.  The weekend just passes in a blur when I do that.Saturday we had our regular gaming group over.  This group has been meeting monthly for probably 30 years.  These folks were co-workers of my husband and over time evolved into friends whose lives we share.  The group has shrunk as a few moved away and one died about a year ago (we are beginning to show our age), but the monthly game continues.  Sunday we had a family dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday.   We are not \"big celebrators\" of birthdays, but we do try to at least get together to share a meal and enjoy each other's company.And the house continues to be quiet ... I do enjoy quiet times (more and more these days), but it is the contrast between what it was like since Friday and what it is like now that always trips me up.No walk for me today either. But my foot is feeling better. I am looking forward to my morning walk tomorrow.  And now Wally is asleep!  I guess he is glad to have his couch back."},

So capitalizing on our good looks and appealing personalities, we decided to (drum roll here!) launch our own blog. Besides, grandma needs to make a success of her blog based on her own merits.  No more tagging on our coat-tails (even if our coats and tails are pretty dog-gone fabulous).  We need to have total editorial control.

{"title": "A complaint from down south", "date": "Friday, August 20, 2010", "text": "A small touch of heel pain upon standing today.  Crap!  I know what to do for this, but crap, crap, crap!!I have Plantar Faciitis. About 12 years ago I developed heel pain when standing after rest. I self-diagnosed myself (went out to the web just like the rest of the computer literate world).  I began using Burkenstock shoes - they kind of look like hippy sandals but they have great arch support.  The first time I slipped my feet into them I thought I had literally stepped into a little bit of heaven.  My feet were happy again - like instantly!  I love instant fixes.  I love Burks.For 10 years I \"treated\" myself using these sandals and for 10 years that worked ... mostly.  Not a cure, but when I got a complaint from my feet, I'd slip my Burks on and \"wa-la\" ... instantly fixed (for awhile). Two years ago, the pain got worse - pain all the time even in my Burks.  I was devastated.  I was walking regularly and for long periods.  I stop walking.  The pain continued. Crap.  My weight went up, and my emotional well being and energy went down, and I was not a happy person.It was podiatrist time.  I convinced myself that it had to be something much worse, maybe a brain tumor!!  (ok, so not really - besides, I couldn't find anything to support that diagnosis on the web, but pain can make you stupid, I am sure of that.)  The doctor's decision - no to the brain tumor (he did sort of smirk) - and yes to  \"Chronic\" Plantar Faciitis.  Crap - chronic!!!  I'd rather be chronically rich, or chronically smart, or chronically young!   He recommended exercises (don't you hate it that exercise seems to be the cure for everything?), physical therapy, rest, icing of the feet several times a day, and prescription orthotics.  Now none of these recommendations fixed me overnight!!  When I got my orthotics the disillusionment set in.  I asked the assistant \"so when will I be well\".    She said, \"oh, give it 3 months.\"   hmmm ... bad answer.  When the doctor came in I asked him \"so when will I be well\" and he said \"come back in 6 months and we will see how your pain is\" (these answers were going in the wrong direction.)  These folks didn't understand that I wanted \"instant\" - not 6 months.  I complained.  Too long, too long!!!  He  paused and got serious -\"If I could put you in a wheel chair for 3 weeks - never, never, never on your feet - not even one time during the 3 weeks - you would be well faster - in 3 weeks.   OR I could do surgery and cut your tendon and you would be recovering for 6 months to a year.  But you would then be well permanently.\"   As stupid as it sounds, I did pause - well ... the wheel chair was a \"maybe\" ... no ... that was an insane choice. It took a full year for these feet to get back to normal.Now a small little complaint from down south - a less than a 5 minute touch a pain in just one foot -  which went away after standing for a minute - but a serious warning from down south! Message from my feet?\"Don't forget who is carrying you during all this walking. Don't forget to do your icing and exercises.  And don't forget this message (and really pay attention here) ... I can \"take you down\" again, just like I did in the past.\"Respect the feet!  I think I will rest and ice on Saturday!"},

I care for each and every one of you.I am having so much fun with this that I would do it even if there were no followers - but 9!!!  Time is a very precious commodity these days.  Thank you for spending some of your precious time with me.Today is dog day.   Well, if you count all the days in the week that I have dogs, 5 out of 7 are \"dog days\" - at least during the spring, summer and fall. Today I get to sit and knit with my 3 charming canine companions snoring peacefully at my side,   ... except for when I am taking Milo out to pee, or restraining Milo from badgering the older dogs, or digging around in Milo's mouth to remove random bird poop, or getting the dogs out for a group walk (which is the definition of a 3-ring circus, believe me), or corralling the dogs into the kitchen for dinner, and then it is quickly poop time and we need to examine Milo's poop to be sure it is the right consistency (don't ask!!).  I really love Thursdays!Upon further reflection,  I think I'll skip knitting.And before the end of the month, I plan to do some sort of a summary on how I am doing on these goals I sometimes talk about.  An end of month self-assessment would help keep me honest.  I don't want this blog to read like a self-improvement magazine article which tends to be worthless. I've listed 5 things that are important to me so far.  There are others just chomping at the bit to be released from their \"draft\" status, but I will hold off until September.

So glad I am done with this 3 day insanity.  I usually clean for 2 reasons: company or I am upset! Yes, when upset, I head for the pail and mop and I scrub things.  And I vacuum, dust and throw away things ... to excess.  Once I cleaned the kitchen in a fit, filling 3 very large trash bags.  Defiantly I challenged my husband to name one thing that was missing ... now, you should know that he cares not one twit about the kitchen, probably wouldn't have missed a thing if I had stripped the room bare.  And I am not sure, but he may have backed slowly out of the room!!  This time I cleaned because the house was driving me nuts! Thus ... the insanity. And I hope  is done for the next 6 months (*sigh* - please don't insert any reality into this conversation - 6 months is what I am aiming for!) Maybe an outhouse in my backyard would help keep my 4 toilets clean. This one looks cozy!  Wonder if the park would notice it was missing?Today's walk was rainy but very lovely.  And other than taking a picture of the park's porta-pot (which caused another solitary walker to do a double-take), it was uneventful.  It started out drippy and then progressed to a monsoon 10 minutes after I walked out the door.  But no matter, I persisted.  And I am glad that I did because I made my normal detour through my grocery store (wasn't raining in there), and if I hadn't persisted I would have missed these beautiful sunflowers on display in the store.   You just have to look - there is beauty in even a rainy day.I love walking in the rain.  The temperature is usually comfortable, no sun scorching heat - everything looks drenched by water (just like a big drink for everything) and quieter - gentle rain just makes things quieter.  When I was in college I remember walking barefoot in the rain - no rain coat, no umbrella, no shoes - just enjoying the clean feeling of everything.  Now my old feet need those arch support thingys, and I can't stand worms squeezed between my toes.  ugh! I didn't worried about worms when I was in college.  Were there worms?  Am I really older than dirt?  If so, it was before worms, because worms need dirt.I will know when my son starts reading my blog!  He won't be able to help himself.  He will comment: \"Yes, mom, I have been telling you, you are older than dirt.\"  Thankfully I have the two best \"kids\" and silly things are always said with love.  It has been a good day.

Great time of the day to do it and it really does launch you into the day with more energy.  And the picture?  Well, I have decided to include some photos that are \"A View From My Walk\".  What surprised me was that - when you go looking for beauty, it is easy to find.  And my walk passed too fast.  I was sorry it was over after 65 minutes.  Today I watched a runner pass me, and I couldn't help but wonder - do runners really \"see\" the world around them as they run?  Or are they focused on how their body is performing, the next mile, the speed of their performance? I had a little time left at the end of yesterday, so I added 2 Widgets to my blog.  One widget is to Walker Tracker, a web site aimed at walkers who use a pedometer.  The link shows a brief summary of my step entries and provides a link to the website for more detail.  If you are interested in this site, I am esknitter there - and my avatar is a picture of me when I was about 4 years old.  The second widget is a Free Traffic Feed.  This widget allows you to see the geographic location of the visitors to the blog. Pretty interesting.   There is one other widget I am struggling to add - the link to MapMyRun - this is another activity tracking website that my family uses, and we sort of keep track of each other's efforts - not to badger or nag, but to encourage and motivate.  I will track the details of my exercise on Walker Tracker and MapMyRun, and post summary info on the blog.  Seems silly to track stuff in 3 places and the two sites do a good job.First floor cleaning of the townhouse almost done - just the powder room to finish.  I will have some company this afternoon.  Tuesday is Meaty and Grimmy day at my house, so I will pick them up soon.  They are two old-timer dogs now so they don't mind me cleaning - just as long as I don't run the vacuum.  ;-)  Tuesday is also knitting meeting day, but I skipped it this week - didn't want to put any other road-block in the way of getting cleaning done.  I really did miss it.  Tomorrow will be Day 3 of this cleaning marathon.  I need to finish up on Wednesday for two reasons:  I am not really enjoying this, just want to be content in my own house again, and Thursday is Milo, Meaty and Grimmy Day.  Nothing gets done when the 3 Musketeer Dogs are here!And I am sort of dreading Wednesday cleaning. I'll be working on the bedroom level.  This level frequently gets skipped when I am rushed (it is not visible to a causal visitor, one whole floor up, keep the blinds closed and no one will know ... you get the idea!).   And there are 2 full bathrooms upstairs that are used a lot.  This townhouse has 3 1/2 baths.  The full bathroom in the basement is used only by company.  The half bath on the first floor is easy to clean.  The upstairs bathrooms ... ugh!  In my next life, I am never going to live anywhere that has 4 toilets (unless I am exceedingly rich and have multiple staff - then the more toilets the merrier!!!)"},
{"title": "Day 1 - Cleaning and memories of my mother-in-law", "date": "Monday, August 16, 2010", "text": "It felt great to get outside this morning and walk.  I walked for 62 minutes, and I was just dripping with sweat!  But I really was glad to start the day with that walk.  It was just around my neighborhood (and I am pretty bored to death with the view), but I do feel lucky to have such a shady neighborhood.  After 25 years of living here, the trees have all matured.  And I took my walking tour through Harris Teeter - air conditioning and a big drink of water made the detour ever so pleasant.Then I got to work.  I decided to divide my house in 3rds.  I live in a townhouse with 3 floors, so making the division was pretty easy.  My focus today was the finished basement.  I had really hoped to de-clutter and clean, but I decided to focus only on cleaning and picking up stuff.  And because that is the easiest part of the house to clean - it didn't take all day.  So I vacuumed the first floor as well - the level that was causing me the most stress.  There was pet hair (2 cats and 3 dogs worth) everywhere and to add insult to injury there was also copious amounts of leaves that were tracked in by people and the dogs.  It felt good to get that cleaned up.  Much more to do tomorrow.I do love things clean and picked up but I don't enjoy the actual cleaning.  My mother-in-law (may she rest in peace) was an excessively clean and tidy person.  Her home was her hobby.  I think she truly did love cleaning.  And she was a collector of things. All were art-fully displayed and dusted. If something was moved she knew it.  It reminded me of a gift shop.  When I met her, she lived in a 2 bedroom apartment.  It was an older building with wood floors.  Each year, she would get down on her hands and knees and she stripped off the old floor polish from the entire apartment with a putty knife (polish she put on her floor monthly). And she would wash all her walls and all the items in her house (she was a smoker).  It took her two weeks in the spring.  The first time I came to dinner I helped her hand-wash the dishes. I was doing the drying. I was dropping the forks into the forks slot of her drawer.  She pointed out that her forks (and other utensils) weren't dropped into the tray, they were lined up - laying on their sides - in a specific manner.  Her whole apartment was that way.  Just so!  I think it gave her some kind of peace to live like that - control over her environment maybe.  She was a difficult woman to get to know, she had a hard life, she didn't really get along others that well - not even her son, and at her death she had few contacts or friends. And, yet, I think managed to be her friend, and she was a wonderful grandmother to my children.  I think of her often when I clean.  I miss her most then!"},

Not the fun stuff -  the  things that make your life more livable and less confusing but get squeezed off your to- do list by other more pressing stuff.  That is where I am now!So I cancelled all my plans for Monday through Wednesday. The calendar is empty. For those days I plan to start with a walk in the morning, and then begin  at the bottom of my house and clean my way up. I know that sounds odd but the state of my house is adding to my fatigue. It is not clean and it is cluttered. Yes, this will take more than 3 days but it will give me a good start. Just taking a substantially big first step - forward motion - should help.  And sleep ... I need to catch up on sleep. In fact I need to catch up on quiet time. Time when I don't have iPod ear buds in my ears - when I have just my own thoughts to chew on or nature for company. Just slow down my world a bit and re-group for a few days.So no day trip to my friend's house scheduled for Monday  :-( , no knitting or knitting group, no tai chi practice, no blogging, no iPad game playing, no nothing (well, maybe in the evening I can knit a bit).  And there are no doctors visits scheduled, no shopping,  no bank runs, no vet visits, no meetings, and at present, no sick animals. And I'd say no spinning or reading, but despite my best efforts I haven't been able to do any of that for quite some time. Just walk and get my house in order for the next 3 days.Keeping my fingers crossed that I can keep to that plan!PS ... who am I kidding, I will blog!

Murphy's Law needs to be abolished!Monday was a busy errands-day - stuff bumped from the previous due to dog surgery and recovery issues. Tuesday was knitting group (yeah), but by Tuesday afternoon things were going downhill rapidly.  Meathead was displaying preseizure-like behavior - puzzling and worrisome. It resolved by 7:30 pm, but at 10:00 I heard that Milo was developing diarrhea. Wednesday was Milo's day. I travelled into DC to get him. Thursday (regular dog day) began with bad allergic reaction for Meaty - errupting across his whole face and into his forehead.  For 45 minutes he miserably rubbed his face and ears against the rug and couch, rolled on his back to relieve itching any way he could.  After multiple face washings and an administration of benedryl, he collapsed in exhaustion on my cool kitchen floor.  But his face was rubbed raw and red, and terribly swollen.  Thankfully breathing wasn't affected, but the episode was frightening.  Friday morning his face was still badly swollen, so I picked the boys up early (for their regular weekend with grandma) so he would get regular benedryl.  By Friday night, my daughter had arrived and I was really glad to see her - an extra set of capable hands. Today Meathead has a bumpy rash on his muzzle into his eye (rug burn?  more reaction?).  A vet this morning - Grimace to have his chest stitches out and Meaty to have his muzzle looked at ended with stitch removed and ointment for Meaty's face.All is settled this afternoon (knock on wood).  As I write, Grimace is sleeping on the couch beside me, Meathead, Milo and my daughter are asleep on the floor (My daughter and Milo are covered by a sheet - pretty cute.)  My mom is asleep on her chair.  Much snoring is going on.  I wish I could nap, but my brain does not shut off that easily, and although I am just exhausted, a nap wouldn't be enough.

Lately I haven't been able to attend these Friday morning sessions.  Disappointing, but unavoidable.Here are pictures from a mid-summer practice session at the lake.  The previous pictures shown on the August 3 blog post were taken during the spring.  When you compare the two sets of pictures, it appears that we have improved over the summer.  We are all doing the same step at the same time.  While that doesn't seem like such a big deal ... it is.  Anyone who has seen a Tai Chi group perform knows that performing in unison is part of the beauty and the discipline.We applaud our efforts after each run through and comment on the fact that we are \"perfect\". Our instructor uses other words to describe us at times (words that are less perfect than perfect), but all I can remember is  \"perfect\" so that is what we are!   ;-)Of course, our instructor tweaks our movements during class, but he let it slip that we were now an \"intermediate level\" class.  We were thrilled.  And at times I am sure he wants to take back that slip of the tongue.  Too late, we heard it!  Intermediate!!  It is now cemented in our brains.  Yes, perfect and intermediate.

First things first - we went outside for a quick pee (well, he peed and I watched).  I don't want anyone thinking I pee in my front yard!! The sky looked more like night than dawn. Back in the house Milo had a tasty breakfast of chicken and rice grandma made just for him ... he is still recovering from a bit of diarrhea after all. We went back outside again for the more serious business of doing a poop.  The sky looked darker (if that was possible) and it was now raining a bit harder with a little lightening high in the sky.  I don't do lightening, but I do love a good storm.  After Milo did his business (much improved over yesterday), I tried to get him to come in.  He wasn't interested.  He wanted to sit and watch my neighbors going to work. Now I usually don't find that interesting, but I do so cater to his whims when I can.  So we sat on my small front covered porch and watched the sky light up and the rain fall lightly.  It was a peaceful thing to do.  I was glad he made me pause to enjoy a side of nature that I love - rain!  It was a quiet time.\"The quiet before the storm\" it turns out, because now at 7:05 am we are sitting on the couch, he is asleep beside me and the rain is pelting the windows hard - thunder is rumbling and lightening just exploded outside our window - enough to make us both jump.  I will check later to see what it hit because it was close enough to light up my shaded front windows with a very mean sharp boom!  Very close.  A picture would express a 1,000 words right now.  Sorry I don't have one.  I hope my friend who walks 6-7 miles early in the morning is watching this storm from the safety of her home!

Today was one of those days.Got a call last night from my daughter.  Grand-dog Milo had loose stools.  A puppy often has loose stools, but it is cause for concern because diarrhea when they are young can cause a rapid decline. And I had my son's two dogs Tuesday.  Meathead (an epileptic) was acting restless with some unusual behavior all afternoon. In light of a recent change in his meds we suspect he had mini-seizure activity rather than his typical grand mal seizures.  So getting a call at 10:00 pm about Milo just seemed to fit into the puzzle that was my day.  This morning Grandma is going into town to pick up her Milo.  Don't want another messy crate.  His mom already had one of those when she came home work a few weeks ago ...  a very sad Milo she found sitting in a mess.As my son is fond of saying ... we have the \"broken\" pets.  Max, our cat, has degenerative kidney disease, and gets fluids every other day with the prognosis of a shortened life span. Meathead has epilepsy diagnosed at age 3 and has been on meds.Meathead and Grimace have hypothyroid disease and are on meds. (and hypothroid disease complicates epilepsy - to be expected because he is a Shanks dog.)Grimace had a fatty tumor removed, and we are waiting on the biopsy.Milo seems to have problems producing a solid stool much to the chagrin of his mom.  Wally, our other cat, motors on without problems - well, his problem will be when he is weighed at the vets, and then we get a weight loss lecture.  I think vets should be required to address weight issues with the animal directly!  This dressing down of the pet owner for the \"chunky-monkey\" pet they brought in is just unfair - probably unconstitutional!  I think that owners of \"chunky-monkeys\" everywhere should write their congressional representatives and make their demands known.

{"title": "Walking through dust and shrinkage", "date": "Monday, August 9, 2010", "text": "Yesterday, after blogging, I got ready for my walk.  It was 88 degrees out - warm - but not too humid.  I had missed walking for many days. I wasn't accepting the excuse that it was too warm to walk today. I would carry water.  And I try to carry my camera now, and I always carry my ipod, keys, and tissues.  It was more stuff than I could carry in my pockets.  So I went in search for a fanny pack I purchased years ago for walking and hiking - the one with a pouch for carrying water and pockets for other stuff.After digging it out of my closet I made two rather unsettling discoveries.  First, it was covered in dust.  Dust!!!  Had it been so long since I used this fanny pack?  Apparently so.  I had to admit that we hadn't done much hiking, and although I had been walking regularly about 1 1/2 years ago, I don't think I used this item then.  No matter.  I dusted it off, cleaned out the pockets, washed the water bottle and filled it with ice water.  I was ready to roll!I tried to strap it on my waist.  It was too tight!  Like REALLY??  Too tight over summer clothes?   (and probably too tight over no clothes, but I wasn't walking in my \"birthday suit\" just to avoid adjusting the belt).  I remember pausing for a moment - thinking that something was caught, twisted, bunched up - something making the fit snug.  I even consider the possibility that the nylon belt had shrunk while in the closet.  Yes, that must be it!  Shrinkage.  I felt better!And so I went for my walk - 55 minutes - warm but do-able, and although nothing interesting happened while walking, I was glad that I persevered and took that walk.  Today will be too warm to walk outside, so I will walk on my treadmill while watching a spinning fiber video, with cool air from a fan and air conditioning.  And no need to wear my fanny pack today.And for those who suggest that I need a \"reality check\" for that nylon belt, I say no. Reality is an overrated state-of-mind.Total Steps: 10,028"},

{"title": "A Saturday at the Mannings", "date": "Saturday, August 7, 2010", "text": "Poised to begin!It was a beautiful day for an outdoor event at The Mannings and a perfect combination of family, fiber activities, food, and learning.  All the anticipation and planning of the previous weeks leading up to this one day - a day that seemed to pass in the blink of an eye.  Wouldn't it be grand if someone invented something that could slow down time just for one wonderful day.I had 2 goals for that day (beyond spending time with family):  begin spinning on my new spinning wheel and avoid purchasing yarn in the shop.  Check and check!!  I made a major discovery with spinning on a wheel - although it looks restful when done by skilled hands, it is anything but restful when done by a newbee like me.  There have got to be 6 things going on all at the same time, using both hands, and both feet and your brain - AND there is a small cycle of activity that gets applied over all that - drafting, allowing the twist to into the drafted fiber and then allowing the wheel to take up the spun fiber and then repeat, and repeat and repeat in order.  *sigh*.  I had to take a break to work on a complicated lace knitting pattern - at least while I was doing that my feet were resting.  And no fiber purchases in the shop ... that probably was a first in the 13 years I have been knitting that I left empty handed.  Actually I am trying to avoid buying yarn from anywhere for awhile. Over the winter I inventoried of my yarn stash - based on knitting 5,000 yards of yarn a year ... I would need to live to 92 or 93 before I ran out!  That calculation just continues to fester in my brain.  I am not opposed to having a decent stash of yarn, but I think a small yarn shop worth is pushing the envelope on acceptable. The main challenge of the day was keeping our chairs in the shade.  We started the morning perfectly situated under a tree, facing out past a grapevine to a rural setting unmarred by development.  As the sun moved, so did we unfortunately.  Each re-location was supposed to be our final move.  We move 4 times - but in the end we won the battle with the sun.  And for the second year in a row, my sister won one of the many door prizes they announced. I think my sister should play the lottery!  First Efforts - alittle thick and chuncky but a start!  I have already decided I need to buy a Wooley Winder so that I don't need to keep moving the yarn over the hooks!  Have to save up for that.One beautiful person is missing from this shot.  Our other cousin LC from PA.  She had to work in a new job.  She was missed!Total Steps:  3728 (that is what you get when you sit in the car to go, sit at the knit-in, and sit in the car to return - and, of course standing - like we did for this picture - not too many steps there either!)"},
{"title": "#5 Family - a joyful family tale", "date": "Friday, August 6, 2010", "text": "We are a small family. My husband was an only child. His parents have passed. My parents' families have not been close, and with the exception of a dear Aunt and her family on my mother's side, my contacts with grandmothers, aunts, uncles, cousins are a distant memory. No big break up, just a drifting away.And so my sister and I chose a different path.  Our two families are close - our children are close as cousins.  It is important to me, even as I struggle with senior issues in caring for my mother.A joyful family tale:  One day several years ago my sister plugged our maiden name into Google.  The unusual last name produced an unusually small list of possibilities.  In the list was the name of a cousin on my father's side of the family - a cousin who kept her maiden name when she married. We had memories of that family and playing with our cousins as children.  Excitedly my sister contacted me at work wondering about contacting this lady with our cousin's name.  My sister sent the email - giving some of our history, assuring her she was not \"fishing\" for anything and apologizing in advance for bothering her if she was not related to us. And my sister received an answer ... yes, indeed, this lady was related to us, and the rest is joyful history.  We connected with a long lost cousin (actually 3 cousins and our Aunt), who had also wondered about us over the years.  The thread of family memory and the joy of discovery after probably 50 years was overwhelming to all of us and still makes us happy when we relive that time.  Although we reside in different states, we make a point of seeing each other regularly now, sharing our experiences and our hobbies, and keeping the up to date on our lives. The printed word does not do justice to how wonderful it is to have this small portion of our family \"returned\" into our lives.Yes, family is really #1. This weekend we are meeting again at The Mannings!!!  Family is very much on my mind.Total steps: 4351 (cooking only - in preparation for Saturday)"},
{"title": "Fabulous Knitting Folks", "date": "Thursday, August 5, 2010", "text": "Once a week I sit and knit with a group of wonderful knitters.  We can have anywhere from 4 to 24 people at these get-togethers.  You never know who is coming, but the mix of personalities is always wonderful.  I so enjoy their company and look forward to Tuesdays.This is our second spring-summer-fall in this location. And it is perfect most times.  Beautiful courtyard with a water fountain, cover from the sun, and many options for eating.  Come winter we move indoors to a local historic mill - but this outdoor spot is best - frequently our numbers grow just by people passing by and stopping - before you know it, they come with their needles and yarn, and they become friends.Meathead and Grimace went home with their papa last night.  They are back to acting like their normal selves which was joyful to see.  This morning after food shopping, I will be picking up Milo and later in the day, getting Meaty and Grimace too.  Both my kids have evening plans so Thursdays are typically time-with-grandma for the dogs.  And I am very excited about this weekend.  Saturday my sister and I are traveling up to The Mannings in PA.  This is a shop but also a destination for all things knitting, spinning and weaving related ... almost a kind of fiber art community.  The Mannings are located in a rural setting about 20 minutes outside of Gettysburg.  The main facility has probably 5 or 6 rooms devoted to yarn, unspun fiber, books and tools, and space to house weaving looms and spinning wheels.  They hold classes and various events. This Saturday is their annual \"Knit In\" - a time for those interested in knitting to come with a picnic lunch and settle under one of their many trees to sit and knit and visit with friends all day.  My sister and I will be joined by our cousins who live in PA and I will be bringing Agatha - my cousin is a spinner and she will help me get Aggie oiled correctly, adjusted and then help me with the basics of spinning on this beautiful wheel. My sister purchased an antique spinning wheel about a month ago - it must be almost 100 years old.  I am hoping that wheel comes too.  It should be a great day.And let me not forget to thank my beautiful daughter for staying with her grandma so that I could get away for the day with peace of mind.  Hobbies, pets, family and friends make life very rich. I am blessed to have a generous helping of each in my life.Total Steps: 4837 - pretty much the total I get if I don't take a walk"},

{"title": "One sad Pug", "date": "Tuesday, August 3, 2010", "text": "There is nothing sadder than a Pug that is in pain!Today Grimace and Meaty went in for their routine dental cleanings.  Grimace had a fatty tumor on his chest for over a year.  But lately it had grown in size so the recommendation was to remove and biopsy it - which was done today while he was under anesthesia for the teeth cleaning.  He was one sad pup today, and this evening (of course, his Grandma wanted to keep them overnight and into tomorrow) - this evening he is hurting. You know you are in trouble, when he can't (won't) walk to the end of your 10 foot sidewalk (his walks with Grandma are what he lives for), when he has to be encouraged to eat a \"cookie\" (i.e. a cheese wrapped pain pill), when he can't find a comfortable position, so he stands or sits for most of the day and evening when he is dead tired and can't keep his eyes open, and you know for sure you are in trouble when he finally  gets comfortable on your pillow ... you know the one ... the one that works perfectly for your problem neck and shoulders ... and you think \"oh well, it is only one night and he looks comfortable ... finally\".   I don't think either one of us will get much sleep tonight.  Just gave him a pill for pain - hoping that does the trick.  Better go get another ice pack for that sore chest of his.Total Steps: 8784 (will be more when my walking buddy is back on his feet - Get Well Grimace)Earlier this summer our Tai Chi class started practicing at a local park one morning a week.  We were lucky find a covered pavillion for our practices. We had shade and we had a beautiful lake for the backdrop to our practices.  During one of our first visits to this site,  local geese would gather to watch our efforts. When the music started playing, they would \"sing\" along.I need to practice more."},
{"title": "Aggie (Agatha) has been born!!", "date": "Monday, August 2, 2010", "text": "So here she is!  Agatha was born this morning.  That \"spring-y thing-y\" (known to spinners as a tension spring - pictured below) that was giving me so much trouble just finally fell into place  and then everything else seemed to follow logically.  And the wheel actually spins!!  Too funny saying that, but I just was surprised when I had all the pieces in place and I pushed on the pedals and it moved the wheel and the wheel moved the thing-y with all the hooks (OK, I am still learning the terminology).  It made me smile.The green bag beside the wheel is specially designed to hold the spinning wheel when it is folded down.  It has various pockets designed to hold pieces of the wheel when it is folded.  It is padded and molded inside to hold the wheel snugly.  So I am still oiling and adjusting and reading up on what I need to have a \"happy and healthy\" Aggie.  I am please so far with this spinning wheel.Total steps: 4421 (pathetic - need to do better)Some goals are hopefully life-long activities (walking, Tai Chi, stretching), and some are long-term. spanning years to complete.  An important long-term goal for me is the completion of my family's photo albums.  When I retired it was #1 on my to-do list, and I had grand plans. Scrapbook everything!! With enthusiasm I went to the craft store, bought specialty paper, stickers, paper punches, special pens, idea books. It was a fun fest, but when I sat down to do the first page I realized it was not do-able.  My old albums were falling apart, old sticky album pages were damaging my photos, and the idea of \"scrap books\" faded very quickly. My focus changed.  Scrapbooks weren't for all your pictures - just for a single topic or person.  One page of a scrapbook would contain a single picture or two surrounded by artistic elements and could take a day to design and complete.  Forty years of pictures would take 50 years of scrap booking (well, maybe not really, but way longer than I wanted to do).  And many of the pictures wouldn't make the scrapbook - too many would be unused. What I wanted was as many of the memories in these pictures as I could capture, not the art work.Over the last 40+ years, I have taken pictures - lots (just ask my kids).  Pictures document family history in a way that print can't capture.  I started to consolidate, crop, label, cull (how many pictures of elephants in a zoo do you need) and re-mount these pictures into new photo albums - albums that are simple and are archival.  It has been a JOB.  So far I have completed the albums up to the early 1990's - with dates, peoples' names and locations.  And I still have many years of pictures to process - hard copy and electronic.  My goal is to complete the photo mounting/archiving, and then begin the process of writing diary-like entries in the album so that if someone enjoys seeing and knowing the history of this family during my time as a part of it, they will have the details.  The expect that this whole process should take several more years.And as for all the scrap booking supplies??  Well I haven't totally given up the idea of a single scrap book at some point.  I just need to narrow the focus."},
{"title": "My spinning wheel has a \"birth-mark\"!", "date": "Sunday, August 1, 2010", "text": "Well the assembly of the spinning wheel has hit a snag.  There is a spring-y thing-y that I can't seem to get attached properly.  The wheel comes partially assembled and with assembly instructions and tools. But the instructions come with a cover sheet that says in BOLDED, ITALICIZED AND UNDERLINED, and over-sized print, that the distributor wants to help you if you have questions, they give a phone number and the whole sheet is filled with assurances that they want your spinning wheel experience to positive - so please call if you have questions with assembly!!        hmmm .....I am always suspicious of overly-formatted text.  I can't help but wonder if the writer thinks you can't read it unless it is big, or pick out the important parts without help,  or maybe added emphasis is the goal - but it always looks like yelling to me, or ... (and here is what I really think is going on with the spinning wheel instructions) ... the assembly instructions are a bit convoluted and are not easily understood by a non-spinner.  Thankfully I am seeing my cousin on Saturday who is handy at tinkering and experienced in spinning.  If I am unsuccessful this week, she will rescue me!  On the up-side. The walnut stain is beautiful and the wheel is beautiful.  I did notice a small ding on one of the wood pedals. I am treating it as 'birth-mark\" ...

Armageddon!!Milo and I began our day in such a promising way.  We got up at 6:30 am - love it that he now sleeps through the night, and after little cuddling on the bed (he is such a cuddler) we went out for a walk.  He peed right away - good boy, he looked for a cookie, I gave him one, he pooped right away, good boy, he looked for a cookie, I gave him one, we went inside ... he ran into the living room and peed on a blanket - I yelled NO, and we went right back outside again.  Of course, he was looking at me - not for a cookie this time - but wondering just why we were outside when he had done EVERYTHING FINALLY that he was going to do!!!  So, that was the first 10 minutes of my day.  Now he has had his breakfast and we are sitting on the couch and he has gone back to sleep beside me.  He is so cute!

{"title": "Thursday ... I finally sat down", "date": "Thursday, July 29, 2010", "text": "I knew today would be tight.  I set my alarm for 6:30 am - wanted to get out for my walk before there was no time for it. I walked for an hour. I often see on others blogs beautiful pictures of forested paths, lake shores, parks ... beautiful areas for  walks.  My walk typically is around my neighborhood.  It is a very nice area.  But my walk includes a sweep through my local shopping center (the courtyard is pictured on the left).  AND it continues through the grocery store - yes, in this hot weather, I very much look forward to my 10 minutes walking up and down the isles of Harris Teeter and at the end, a cool drink of water before leaving the wonderfully cool artificial environment. (In the picture on the right try to imagine a forest path, trees, grass, forest critters - only my path has air conditioning and a water fountain at the end - and if I am really decadent, an icy cold something from the Starbucks in Harris Teeter. :)  You serious walkers out there don't know what you are missing!) And that was my last \"alone and peaceful moment\" for the day.Upon getting home today, there was mom's breakfast to get ready (and breakfast and a shower for me), Then food shopping with Mike, then take mom to the bank, and then to a free lunch event for seniors with mom at the Amherst House.  Then it was 12:45 pm.After dropping mom at home, I headed into Bethesda MD to pick up Milo.  Usually a 45 minute trip, but I made it in 35 minutes (unusual for the Washington area).  Milo and I were in the car on our return trip for about 3 minutes when the skys opened up above us and the rain came down in sheets.  So the trip took 75 minutes to get back (the Washington Beltway was terrible) - and we then we swung up to Elkridge to pick up Meathead and Grimace.  Thankfully the rains had stopped by then.   When I walked into Matt's house, Meathead had diarrhea in the house so I cleaned that up.  I then loaded his two boys into the car with Milo, and then it REALLY FELL APART.  Milo decided to bark his scratchy bark at Meathead - all the way home - about 15 minutes - in his face - over and over.  Poor Meaty, he was sitting in the back seat next to Milo's crate - there was no where he could go. He just had to sit there next to Milo who was losing his little mind.  And then multiple dog walks and fixing dinner and I am finally sitting down - it is 6:30 pm.  Where did this day go?And now, at 6:30 pm I just checked my pedometer - presently I am at 12,063 steps (7870 steps are from my morning walk).  I still have two dogs walks left and I have to take Meaty and Grimmy home after 9:00 pm.  I will be glad to climb into my bed tonight (although my bed will be the blow up mattress that I set up in the living room for Milo and me - no matter - it will feel pretty good.)Hope your Thursday went better.Total Steps: 13,689 (but if feels like it was 20,000)"},

They are Max and Wally, and I would be remiss if I didn't include them in my blog.  Here are my handsome boys.  Wally on the left and Max on the right.  They are brothers (obviously).  Max has degenerative kidney disease which makes us sad because it will shorten his life.  We inject fluids under his skin every other day to help him maintain his weight and help with his quality of life.  With the fluids he can continue to eat and play and just be his normal self.

It was a big decision - and a pretty pricey piece of equipment for a hobby.  But it is what I want to do and I am tired of putting off the decision.  Procrastination ... not something I usually do!  I am pretty excited about it.  But in a few days I expect I will be facing a big box with a spinning wheel in it, and I won't have any idea what to do with it after I cut the tape on the box.  Thank goodness I ordered a DVD to go with it.  And then on August 7th I will see my dear cousin Linda, who will walk me through how to spin.  It is great having someone with experience who can help you.  Walking-wise - I walked this morning early.  I was out for 55 minutes - almost an hour.  I felt great.  The weather was acceptable but I am so looking forward to the fall when the weather in the morning should be cool and crisp!  I also went to Tai Chi practice this afternoon  and I always feel like I really exercised my legs alot.  Our instructor returns next week and we hopefully will learn the 6 missing  movements - the tough ones - the ones that take alot of strength.  I better put 911 and EMTs on speed-dial."},
{"title": "Two days in a row ... woo hoo!  And a close encounter!", "date": "Tuesday, July 27, 2010", "text": "Ok, so maybe 2 days in a row of walking isn't such a big deal, but since I had many many days in a row of NOT walking, I'll take this small victory!Tuesday's walk included a close up encounter with a deer!  I think we were both shocked!!!  I was walking down a very quiet side street in my neighborhood, and a full size deer (female, I guess because there was no rack on her head), stepped out from behind 2 big bushes.  I stopped and stared at her - and she stopped and stared back.  I am sure we were both thinking, \"What the hell are you doing here?\"  Of course my question was more valid because this is an established development.  Or maybe her question was more valid because this was her home BEFORE we took over her range.  Regardless, it was a staring stand-off! And then ... down the street a car was slowly pulling out of a driveway, and she slowly glanced over her shoulder at the car, and then back at me again as if to say ... \"Really?  You didn't think you could take me without back up?\"  and then she turned deliberately and wandered back into the woods.  I was soooo sorry I didn't have my camera.  My knitting blogging friend carries her camera on all her walks. I may start doing that as well.Total Steps: 7820This morning I got out for a walk ... the third one since I have started this blog 7 days ago.  This is not the level of frequency I am aiming for,  but I wasn't totally inactive during the weekend.  After getting all the dogs out for a first walk of the morning, one of my favorite activities is taking Grimace for walk next - just him and me.  He loves to walk.  I have my cup of coffee and my iPod with my podcasts on it, and it is just Grimmy and Grandma time.  Love it.  But it doesn't really count as an exercise walk.  We stop at every tree, every sign, every bush, every everything ... making sure that he sprinkles alittle of his urine EVERYWHERE.  For a Pug, he has a bladder the size of a watermellon!  But the walk time is quiet and peaceful.  We both enjoy it.   I have been thinking about the barriers that seem to get in the way of getting out for a walk.  I plan to go back to wearing a pedometer all the time, not just when I walk for exercise.  I started wearing it today.  In the past it has kept me moving, finding ways to keep my step numbers up.  My exercise walks usually generate about 5,500 steps.  Last year when I wore my pedometer all the time my goal was to be above 12,000 and I usually made that total.  I have been as high at 18,000 but that is a stretch for me.  There are studies of pedometer use - and in one study they put pedometers on an Amish population.  These folks are active in their everyday lives - no motorized vehicles, no 20-21st century gizmos to distract them.  It was found that they average 18,000 steps a day.  Pretty impressive.  While I don't hold that as a goal for me, it does provide a framework to gauge my own progress.  After such a long absence, I am happy to have my pedometer back on my hip.Today was also a Knitting Group day.  I sure do enjoy this Tuesday group of knitters. It brightens my week knowing it is coming up.  And this morning the weather was very comfortable.  A blessing, because it has been hot and unhealthy for so very long.  Very much looking forward to my morning walk tomorrow."},

Survived the weekend!I know he is only about 12 pounds and I know he has a look that can melt your heart ...  and I know that I have 63 years on this earth and he has only 4 months ... but ohhhh, my new grand-puppy, Milo, is a \"mover and a shaker\".  This weekend I had all 3 of my kids' dogs - Meaty and Grimmy, the two senior statesmen, and Milo, the new kid on the block with Napoleon-like  aspirations and the energy of the Energizer Bunny.   The only saving grace is that when he goes home, he, too, is exhausted and sleeps for his mom. Things I learned from this weekend:I can walk 3 dogs at one time - and juggled 2 poop bags and get everyone across the street safely - even when Milo is trying to play \"nip Meathead's jowels - we love to eat those drippy drooling bits\" game, and the Grimmy who is still hanging back on the curb to smell that piece of poop that some other dog left!  We do have the advantage that cars in my neighborhood stop - they didn't try to run us over - in fact, they probably couldn't believe their eyes wondering who that crazy lady was in her PJs, standing in the middle of the street talking to dogs who clearly have other agendas, and why wasn't someone taking care of this bunch.I can make dinner and clean up using only 1 hand - the other hand was occupied most of the weekend - keeping Milo on leash so that our 2 senior boys could get alittle peace.  (this is a carryover skill from being a mother - any mothers can do this - no biggy!)I can sleep in one position all night sandwiched between dogs - my right arm doesn't work so well the next morning as it was cradling Milo who is oh so snuggly and cute when he sleeps - and you don't want to disturb sleeping puppies (believe me).  But heck, I have two arms - so I can't complain.Things I learned I can't do from this weekend - at least not yet!I have not cracked the right mix of actions in getting Milo to pee outdoors consistently.  For some reason my carpet is a trigger for little accidents.  Now the up side is that my living room carpet has never been so clean (steam cleaned, this is) since the day it was installed 25 year ago.  Clean is good!  I have not learned how to be consistently firm in correcting him - especially without smiling at the same time - he has no idea what I am saying, but he can read the look on my face very well - it says \"my grandma is a lollipop\".  Got to work on that!"},
{"title": "#3 Keep learning - Dancing with the Stars???  Probably not!", "date": "Saturday, July 24, 2010", "text": "It has been a peaceful morning.  Meathead and Grimace went home yesterday - eager to spend a quiet night sleeping in their own bed without Milo's insistence on playing.  I think Milo missed the canine company but we all really did need a break ... ALL of us!!  Meathead and Grimace will be back today and my daughter will return tonight (Milo will be very very happy) and so we will have a big sleep over tonight - and it will be alittle easier with an extra set of hands.Keep learning: I have given alot thought to how to reach this goal.  Once you leave professional life, you have to seek out learning opportunities independently.  I think it is one of the biggest transitions you have when you retire - keeping your brain active and engaged.  I can honestly say that I haven't done a good job of that over the first few years of my retirement.  I have played around with the possibility of learning a foreign language.  But somehow it doesn't fit with where I am in my life right now ... it would be alot like putting sliced pickels on a peanut butter sandwich.  I like both but together it doesn't seem to make sense.I have considered auditing college classes, but additional time away from home right now is not a viable option.  Of course, when it is possible, I might take some formal art training. It would be fun and I have some unexplored and novice abilities in art.  I think learning Tai Chi over the last year was a kind of learning opportunity.   On the up side - I am reaping more of the physical and mental benefits of Tai Chi. But it took me almost a year to get to this point in Tai Chi, so I should not put on my list of goals - Dancing with the Stars!!! HA This year I have decided to learn to spin fiber into yarn.   This goal fits in perfectly with my interest in knitting.  I have resisted learning to spin for some time ... concerned about the costly  purchase of a spinning wheel, unsure if it was something I really wanted to do, alittle intimidated by the prospect of learning new jargon, new skills, new equipment ... maybe I was intimidated by the prospect of learning again.  After much thought, and looking at various spinning wheels, I am sure that this is my next learning opportunity.    I will buy a new wheel rather than purchasing one second hand.  Knowing next to nothing about wheels - it seemed to make sense to spend alittle more and get a new wheel - one that doesn't have hidden issues that an experienced spinner might spot and know how to deal with.  I am also going to get a portable wheel - one that folds and can be put into a carrying case - and I want one that has some style - old style - and is made out of named woods - not ply board, plastic or pressed/processed wood material (as I have noticed in some well known wheel brands).  The Kromski Sonata is a full size wheel that come is 3 finish choices.  It seems to have a decent reputation and is a wheel that is not easily outgrown. It is a polish manufacturer - and I have polish ancestors - TA DA!  Seems like a match to me!  But seriously, all things considered, it seems to have all the elements I am looking for (the polish thingy was just a plus LOL). So the investigative issues are complete.  Just need to order the item.  I'll wait another week ... And then, major learning begins - still alittle scary!"},

My weekends are usually filled with 3 dogs (my \"kids\" dogs - my grand-dogs) and this weekend has been especially busy since my daughter is in New Jersey seeing a friend. I usually have her helping hand.  This morning is a good example of how most days go with 3 dogs.  Got up at 6:00 am (got to bed early so I wasn't dragging like usual), got them all out together for a walk - well, \"walk\" isn't the right term because they all have their own agenda and there is alot of confusion, tangled leads, corrections from \"grandma\" about not picking up and eating everything that comes along (well that is only the puppy, Milo) and stuff like that.  Then we come in, I feed them - all 3 have different meds that are added to their food - managing their pills is harder than managing my mother's meds, then we had bone chewing time (there was peace for about 10 minutes while that was going on), then the puppy started leaping on the older dogs, so penned him in the kitchen with me while I had breakfast - then we all walked again - this time Meathead, one of the older dogs has loose stools - something he gets when he stressed  (Milo is a \"carrier\" of stress - not stressed himself LOL), then I took them all inside, crated Milo, finally got dressed (yes, I still was in my PJs - I am sure my neighbors wonder about me), and then FINALLY took Grimace, the other older dog, out for his \"grandma-only, walk\" which I give him whenever I can in the morning.  Of the 3 dogs he LOVES to walk and when he is with the other dogs, he doesn't really get to walk, or to sniff all the places he likes or to even pick the direction of the walk.  It is small thing to give him his grandma-only time.  We are back now at 9:15 am - the weather outside is steamy already - it is predicted to be the worst day in a series of really terrible hot and humid days *sigh* - how I just love winter.  Yes, even last winter with all its snow and cold.  Give me winter anyday.  FINALLY everyone is settled down for a morning nap - except me - and I am thinking I could use one too. LOL   Anyway, enough about the little \"time-eaters\" in my life.  Must take advantage of these quiet moments while I have them.Another high value activity for me is Tai Chi.  Unlike walking, I have been active in Tai Chi for about a year.  I have wanted to take Tai Chi from the moment I saw two elderly residents in my community doing Tai Chi in unison one morning in a local park.  It was so tranquil and graceful.  Starting Tai Chi at a local senior center, I discovered that Tai Chi is also strength building and strenuous - not in the way walking or running is strenuous ... you don't get breathless, but physically demanding enough to make you sweat in an air conditioned room.  Besides the grace of the exercise, it builds stronger legs and improves balance.  Both of these are important for me.  My mother lives with me and in the last 4 years I have watched her slide down the slippery slope of mobility.  She walked with a cane some when she moved in, she now can't walk without it, holds on to furniture as she moves around and when she is outside, she uses a walker.  She can't climb the stairs to the bedroom level, so we had to put in a chair lift.  And she is unable to get into a standing position from sitting without a firm chair with arms.  She works her arms more than her legs.  I am hoping that with Tai Chi, I can avoid that fate.  Currently we have learned the 18 form routine and starting in August we will learn the missing 6 movements - movements that require more leg strength and balance than all the others.  The advanced Tai Chi class (they have been with the instructor for 2 years or so), they now work with Swords ... really cool - waving the swords around while doing the moves.  In conjunction with Tai Chi and Walking, stretching must become (once again) part of my routine.  I have been in physical therapy for various conditions and they all improved with stretching.  I used to do various yoga moves and had a regular routine of stretching mixed with yoga.  And as with walking, I felt great - so great that I stopped!!!  I am secretly hoping that this behavior of dropping positive and life-improving activities is a human failing and not just my failing LOL.Hoping for cooler weather tomorrow."},
{"title": "#1 Walking -  1 on the top 20", "date": "Wednesday, July 21, 2010", "text": "So walking, walking, walking heads the list of things that are most important to my next 20 years of living.  I used to walk alot.  Felt great, had lots of energy, slimmed down, got stronger, kept a positive attitude  ... generally all the things I wanted to be.  So I stopped!!  It still astounds me that doing something so positive was so easy to give up.At this point in my life walking is more than just a nice thing to do now.  It is vital to my continued health, strength and well being.  It is the one thing that every other goal rests on to be successful.  If everything else falls on the way-side, this activity must continue.  And I have had several false starts this year in trying to get back into the walking habit.  Something always gets in way.  In the past is was my plantar faciitis - foot pain that was so severe that it required prescription orthotics and expensive walking shoes to fix.  Lately it has been the weather (hot, hot, hot), and then it has been all the dog-sitting I have been doing - leaving a puppy that is not potty trained is just a bad thing, and then most times I am just too tired - and on and on and on the excuses go.  Having someone provide inspiration - someone who somewhat mirrors the stage of your life and your age is important.  In my knitting group there is a woman whose story has motivated me to get serious about walking.  She has been walking every day for years and years and years.  She walks in the morning, she walks 5 or 6 miles and she is fit and slender and happy.  She shared that she was once overweight and out of shape and that walking (and reasonable size food portions) is the main reason for her current state of  health.  I recently found out she has a blog where she talks about her walks.  So simple.  She is approximately my age but could pass for 20 years younger.  She is an inspiration.  I kept thinking ... I could do this same thing.  So this week I began getting up early to walk - getting out early gets the walk out of the way for the day, misses the heat, and takes advantage of having some energy to begin the day.  Yes, sometimes I do have to get up early to squeeze the walk into my morning ... but in all other regards it is the perfect time.  My short term goal for the next few months is to continue to walk 5-6 days a week - for 30 to 45 minutes a day to build up my legs and energy so that when the fall comes I can really crank up the miles.  I realize that 30-45 minutes (at a rate of 2.8-3.0 miles) a day is already a decent time for someone who is 63 years old and has recently been inactive - but I have always been blessed with decent physical stamina and so doing that time is not really a stretch for me, but doing it 5-6 times a week is a stretch.  I am shooting for a goal of 5 miles a day 5-6 days a week.Some of the tools I use to keep my interest up are:  I wear a pedometer during walks so I can track my steps and so that I can figure the miles walked.  And I log my efforts in a website called MapMyRun.com - on an activity calendar.  This web site offers the option of forming groups and creating maps that can give you the mileage of your run or walk.  You can also log other types of activities, such as sports or yoga ... Very good site.  Another site I have used in the past is WalkerTracker.com.  This site is designed for folks who wear their pedometer all day to log steps, to make blog entries, and to track progress though charts and grids ... there are also groups you can at this site ... and there are competitions you can join that are also great fun.  The competitions are based on numbers of steps taken, and ways to increase those numbers over past history.  Sometimes there are prizes and sometimes the prize is just having everyone in your competition know who the winner was.  I haven't been wearing my pedometer the whole day but may start doing so again after I have established a walking routine.  Both sites are free and both have premium paid levels of membership. And I think on this blog as a tool to keep me moving forward towards this goal.  Although I haven't shared this blog with anyone yet, I probably will at some point.  And having the commitment to goals in writing for family and friends to see ... is a help in keeping on task.And so walking tops my list."},
{"title": "The first day of the next 20 years", "date": "Tuesday, July 20, 2010", "text": "The idea of a diary has frequently entered my mind.  In fact, when I first retired in 2007, I started one.  I bought a very attractive book and made several entries.  My goal was to focus on my past memories and to document them in some way so that they could be saved for family. The diary wasn't for me - it was for others.  It seemed important.  But as with other attempts at writing my thoughts, it seemed to be less important with time.  I found the process to be cumbersome (writing with a pen is slow and hard to edit) and of no value to me ... so I stopped.  I also discovered that my diary entries were peppered with reminders of frustrating events and the short comings of others. Not a positive or forward looking process.This blog has a different focus from previous diary attempts.  This blog is about me - my goals and desires - what I hope to do or achieve as I live the next 20 years.  I write it only for me, but it is open to anyone who enjoys reading the musings of others.  It has elements of a \"bucket list\" or a List of 100 goals -two ideas that are so popular now.  My list (at least as this point) will be limited to 20 - 20 items for 20 years.  And although I know some of the items that will be on this list of 20 - the list is definitely in development.  It is a work in progress, just like me.And so I start."}
