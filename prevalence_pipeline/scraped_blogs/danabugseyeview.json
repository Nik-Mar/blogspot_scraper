Sometimes that’s just how the week rolls.Sunday, January 21st         Went by dad’s for lunch anda puzzle – and more turtle pie. That stuff is the devil amazing.Monday, January 22ndSent this photo of my officepoinsettia to Dr. M letting him know I was bringing it home. It’s huge! Tuesday, January 23rd                         Jillian’s twin sister Jackiemade the artwork. We are still so sad. Her dad shared a story about her thatmade me smile. She was trying out softball when she was 11 and all the girlswere wearing masks. She came over to where the parents were sitting to getwater & was wondering why all the masks. One of the moms said that it wasso they don’t get hit in the face. Jillian (under her breath) said, “Well Ijust catch it.” She went back to baseball after that.  Wednesday, January24th                                 Didn’t feel well, but lookedcute. (Well at least until I tried to do a pouty face.) Thursday, January 25th                            Walked into work thismorning with my skirt tucked into my underwear. Iwas informed that the duster hid the horror, but since a (very kind female)coworker is the one who noticed I’m not convinced. Dr. M celebrated Burns Nightby having a wee dram of his favorite single malt, a gift from one of my nephews& his lady. He also watched the American Rogues perform The Gael from Lastof the Mohicans. The female drummer goes by the nickname “hammer of the gods”btw. She is fabulous!Friday, January 26th                          I’ve been feeling run downso I took the day off from work. I had texted a coworker about some work I did& she said I hope that at least you’re in your recliner so I sent her this. Saturday, January 27th                       I’m on church council againthis year & we had our annual working retreat today. Our opening meditationwas about disco balls & I put this headband on. I forgot I was a wearingit & wore it into Dominos later. I also saw a very cool bird feeder. I’m takingMonday off from work too because the next 6 months or so are going to becrazypants at work. I guess that’s one way to make the winter (and spring) flyby. Do you have anything challenging coming up?"},

Notmilder by our standards, but it hardly bears mentioning to anyone outside ofthe state. Of course that won’t stop me from mentioning it. After all, mycousin told me that she saw about 4 flakes of snow one day!Sunday, January 14th        From the socials: My [Enneagram]1 wing won’t let this song go without editing. Nonsensical? Perhaps. But atleast it doesn’t make me grind my teeth. (Yes I’m still listening to Christmasmusic). I wonder as I wander outunder the skyThat Jesus my Savior didcome for to dieFor poor on'ry people likeyou and like meI wonder as I wander outunder the sea Am I right that the line \"For poor on'ry people like you and like I\" is grammatically incorrect? Because it hurts my soul to sing it. (Dramatic Much Bug?)Other things from Sunday: Iwas lector, the heat wasn’t working in the sanctuary so we met in thefellowship hall & the music director had to pull out his accordion, we hada visit from our newest member (the cutest little squish nugget), and I got aword for the year. My word made me a little weepy because that’s what the worldis all about, right? Monday, January 15thThe Rhyne boys do Lincolnton.Party animals! Tuesday, January 16th                        My two chins and I went tothe dentist for a routine cleaning. They checked out the problem area but didn’tsee anything of concern. If it flares up again I’ll go back. Dr. M needed an incandescentbulb for his father’s water system (to keep the switch from freezing), butthose are very hard to find these days. Turns out he just needed to look at thepet store! Wednesday, January17th                                 You know, people thinksoutherners are wimpy in the cold. It was 14 degrees when I left my house so Idressed like I would have in Ohio. And then got laughed at by my coworkers intheir cardigans & blazers. Hmph. 😣  Thursday, January 18th                            Had a little oatmeal as asnacky snack. Which reminds me that I need to make some more! Friday, January 19th                          I’m part of poet LoriHeteen’s Patreon community. Two years agoshe designed calendar pages for us to print out. She’s also the one who came upwith the little booklet idea that I used for Thanksgiving. Anyway, this yearshe’s going to try to give us a print a week that we can use as we see fit. Iprinted out two of them because they really struck me. The one on the left says,“Sift through these ashes, warm with possibility. Life remains. It waits.” The oneon the right says, “I, for one, would like less blatant stupidity and morequaint nonsense.” The Soup King strikes againwith a variation on the jambalaya theme! People, this was REALLY good soup.  Saturday, January 20th                       It was a Very Cold Day and Ihad tuna melt for lunch.  Thismorning I learned that my friend’s 16 year daughter passed away (I wrote abouther last week). She was very proud to be an organ donor, and her family ishonoring her wishes, so she’s still on life support until that process iscomplete. This has been grueling for all of them, and I am full of so muchsadness. This year has just not been going well for so many folks around me.How about you tell me something good from your corner of the world?"},
{"title": "2024 Project 365 – Week two", "date": "Sunday, January 14, 2024", "text": "This wasn’t a particularly fabulous week. We had three more days ofcomputer training. I think I’ve been calling it the wrong thing though. We’rereplacing the City-wide computer system (that handles everything from humanresources to payroll to utility billing to job tickets…) with a new one &we’re actually BUILDING it. The framework is there, but we are customizing itwith our codes, etc. Once it’s complete it will be amazing and good foreveryone (I hope), but until then it is requiring a good bit of braining.Sunday, January 7th        I went to church but as I mentioned last week, I wasin a lot of pain from yet another tooth infection. I posted this picture andasked the interwebs to give me their tricks for calming down a toothache (theoverwhelming winner was cloves), but we live 15 minutes from CVS so I justcontinued to use what I had on hand: saltwater. Orajel didn’t really do anything.Someone did recommend adding Tylenol to my NSAID & it helped for a while. Iwas able to sleep until about midnight & then slept fitfully until morning.  Monday, January 8thI went to work and didpayroll and a couple of other things, then went to see the City nurse. Sheprescribed the same thing my dentist did the last time (steroids andantibiotics) so I went to have those filled & then went home for the day. Itook my first dose of steroids, took a nap, and then woke up already feelingabout 100% better. The miracle of modern medicine! Tuesday, January 8th                        I slept so well that I wokeup at 5:00 a.m. & was at work by 6:40. I got so much done! What I didn’t dowas take a picture. Wednesday, January9th                                 It had poured rain on Tuesday, so on Wednesday Dr. M took his dad for aramble to check out the flooding in Lincoln County. It was pretty impressive.  Meanwhile, during a breakfrom training I went to Dad & Sue’s for lunch, where I got to see awoodpecker at the feeder and eat turtle pie. (The pie was VERY GOOD.) Thursday, January 10th                            Leaving the office late(almost 6:00). The sky was lovely though.  Friday, January 11th                          From the Socials: The sky onmy way to work this morning. It was a wild week that started with tooth pain(100% better thanks to modern medicine), had longer work hours than usual, andended with the news of the death of an old friend. A hard week and a week fullof the privilege of the kind of life I get to live. I think about all thepeople suffering in the world. I think about the people in our country who arestill being oppressed by systems that have been in place for hundreds of years.I think about the life of Dr. King and wonder if we’ll ever get it right. Willwe ever get it right? Dr. M fixed yet anotherfabulous soup. Included here is a photo of me getting ready to eat it, but thereal star is Charlie Horse who has turned into some sort of postmodern artinstallation. He’s got a lot going on. One of these days we’ll get a betterpicture and break it down for you. Saturday, January 12th                       I had a lovely day with afew chores and a lot of not much else. I didn’t even take a photo until late inthe day when I was dusting & got inspired to send this one to my bestfriend. She gave me the ornament and the bear, which is upside down for VeryImportant Reasons. I’m sittinghere feeling guilty that I didn’t go to the MLK service in town, but I’m stillfeeling a little wonky from all the drugs. I'm also spending a lot of energy thinking about an Ohio friend (my first boss up there) whose 16 year old daughter had a medical event & is in Cincinnati Children's PICU very very ill. Added to that there have been several deaths in my orbit, and I am very inside my head. Very happy that I have tomorrow offfrom work. How are things in your neck of the woods?"},

Rightnow it seems to be exactly the same as last year (which was only last week forheaven’s sake). Sunday, December 31st       I DID go to the party –stayed until about 10:30 & was in bed by midnight. The only photo I tookwas this one where Bruno was desperately hoping that someone would drop theping pong ball. And they did, to much hilarity. Really, I should have beenvideoing it.  Monday, January 1st Dr. M was playing with oneof his Christmas presents, a new flashlight from my brother. Dr. M lovesflashlights so he gets them as gifts a lot – which was a good thing when welost power a few months ago. This one is really cool! Tuesday, January 2nd                        From the socials: Thiswasn’t the new me I envisioned when I heard about New Year New You. This meseems eerily familiar. Wednesday, January3rd                                The stem on my amaryllis hasbroken in two places – can’t tolerate the weight of the flower I guess. It’sstill pretty, but not probably won’t last for much longer.  Thursday, January4th                             Dr. M says, “Had to see aman about a cat.”  Friday, January 5th                          My sister-in-law Bren cameby my office so I could refresh her memory on crocheting during my lunch hour.She’s starting on a VERY ambitious project – a temperature blanket for her kingsize bed.  Saturday, January6th                        I was inspired by Bren tokeep working on this WIP that has been stuffed in a bag for a while. Every yearI have a formal or informal resolution to finish all my WIPS before I start newprojects. And every year I fail rather spectacularly. Here’s hoping I can atleast finish one of them! I’mcurrently suffering with yet another infected tooth. I don’t know what the heckis going on – it’s most tender where I have my implant (and the tooth beside ithas had a root canal). All I know is that I am a great big whiny baby when my teethhurt. I wish we could get antibiotics over the counter (and no, I don’t reallywish that but it’s very annoying that I have to wait at least until tomorrow toget some relief). So, how are YOU doing?"},

But there are good things too! I’m going to try to remember those whenI’m in the middle of the madness. Sunday, December 24th      We went to Golden Corral forChristmas Eve dinner. It was a nice time! But it’s really too bad that Nanny doesn’tlike the great grandchildren. I tried to get a cuteChristmas photo of the boys. Success?  Monday, December 25thChristmas selfies! Dr. M& I went to his dad’s for lunch. While we were there, a couple from hischurch stopped by with food. Dr. M had been worrying about what to feed his dadsince he wouldn’t get his meal delivery for three days – problem solved! That evening I finished thepuzzle my work Secret Santa gave me. So much fun! It was about lap sized(it’s in the lid to a cardboard file box). I loved how so many of the pieceswere shaped like critters. Can you see the sheep and penguin? Tuesday, December 26th                       The 40th annualChristmas gathering of college friends! Dr. M made his famous French ToastCasserole and I had a great time.  Or did I? Wednesday, December27th                               On Wednesday I stayed home.   Thursday, December28th                             On Thursday I went back towork. This is my view on the way home.  Friday, December 29th                          Went by dad’s & they hadcompleted the Christmas puzzle. This was a fun one (yes, I realize I say thatabout almost all the puzzles.) Amaryllis progress! Saturday, December30th                        I went to a birthday partyfor my older great-nephew (he turns three on Monday). I had a nice time. Notethe photo of GP with the gift his FATHER gave him – a little drum set.Fortunately it’s not as loud as a full sized one. I gave him books, as usual.   I havetomorrow off and then I’m back to work again. I’ve been invited to a NYE party,but I’m thinking I won’t go (the aforementioned issue with birthday cake). We’llsee – it doesn’t start until 7:30 or 8:00 so I have plenty of time to change mymind. What are you doing tonight?

My dad added maraschino cherries to thechocolate waffle mix and it was pretty darned good. However, I think we mightbe done with the chocolate waffle experiment.

Ha! Tuesday, December 19th                       No photo.  Wednesday, December20th                               I finished my iPad cover. Ireally love that accidental color pooling.   Thursday, December21st                             They brought in lunch forthe City Hall employees. I thought our HR assistants did a great job settingup. And I could see the “fireplace” from my desk (my office is right beside theconference room). Fun! Friday, December 22nd                         I’ve been decorating myoffice plants with the ornaments I’ve received. One of my coworkers gave me theplant stake – love it! My anniversary flowers arestill going strong. The lilies have opened and they are GORGEOUS! Saturday, December23rd                        We went by Dr. M’s dad’s tomake sure he had lunch & then headed to his aunt’s for a soup &sandwich lunch (much appreciated during this season of decadence).  Aspredicted, it was a crazy work week, with the addition of more people thanusual needing help with things. There was lots of food and peopling, and thathas continued over the weekend, through today, & again tomorrow. On Wednesday I plan to notleave the house at all and I might fast. (Note: I probably won’t fast. Althoughmy body would probably be grateful.) And then it’s back to work on Thursday. Whatare you up to this week?"},
{"title": "Dr. M's Christmas Poem", "date": "Friday, December 22, 2023", "text": "It was Dr. M's turn to write the Christmas poem this year, and I have to say that he knocked it out of the ballpark. He is all of us, I think. He didn't try to wrap it up in a bow like I usually do (leaving my poems looking all awkward like they're wearing a smiling mask that doesn't fit). He just expressed our inner angst, which is frankly his spiritual gift. Without further ado - here is poem #32:Days shorten…wefall back.Night shadows growlong…we cower.Is this the end?Will there be enough?Enough sustenance,strength, time?Will there beenough light? Hope?                                           Days shorten…welook inward.Squirrels leapfrom oak to oak,Leaves rainingdown as they move.Like them, wenest, we forage.We store for thelean times, the cold. The longest nightof the year comes.We pray that ourinner fire will,With faith andlove and each other,Outlast thedarkness and give birthTo a new light, anew life, a new hope. We cry out in ourdespair, lamenting.Tears fall hot andsalty as light fades.How long, oh Lord?How hard and cruel?How will wesurvive the darkness?We look to theheavens, longingly. And so we wait, incold, still silenceFor Emmanuel…Godwith us…Advent!We wait forMessiah, our savior,Our last besthope. In faith we wait.Listening fortrumpets and angel voices! In the darkness achild cries, afraid.He will be arefugee, innocent, hunted,Hated for his mereexistence. He willKeep company withthe poor, the sick,The reviled, andcall them family. Jesus wept and somust we, and mourn.Families are tornasunder, plunderedLike so manytemples. In a world whereBombs, bullets,and hate reign supreme,Can hope and lightstill be found?  Mike& Dana RhyneChristmas2023"},

Delicious! We’ve been talking aboutgetting a larger TV because we were having trouble reading the scores for ourbaseball & hockey games. Dr. M finally took the plunge & used some ofhis birthday money to get this one. It’s huge! (To us anyway.) And SUCH animprovement in technology. We can use his Amazon Prime account to watch movies,air drop from our phones if we want to, and of course actually see the hockeyscore. Amazing!

Sunday, November 19th      I saw this license plate inthe drive-through and at first I thought heck yeah I’ll buy Snark Yarn, butthen I realized that it was a snarky nurse driving the car and I guess that’sok too.            I was taking green beancasserole to work on Monday for our holiday meal & I told Dr. M I wasafraid I would forget it so he put this helpful hint on the counter. Monday, November 20thIn addition to our holidaymeal, we had a little mini bridal shower for one of our assistants who wasgetting married on Friday.  Tuesday, November 21st                      We watched one of myfavorite “comfort food” movies.

Someone on Instagram said that the cutting board & knifephoto looks like the cover of a cozy murder mystery.

That picnic table has some age on it, too, but it’s still strongenough to support a catnap. The wood shop is quiet, the tools covered in dust.My 91 year old loves sitting out there in the sunshine, petting his guard catand glaring at the falling leaves. Some days he is present, asking significantquestions and trying to understand my answers. Today he was lost in memoriesfrom well over 70 years ago. And the guard cat slept on. I made a sleeve for my iPadand then decided to frog it. I really liked it, but it was a smidge too small.Unfortunately I think adding a couple of stitches to the width is going to make me lose thatexcellent accidental color pooling (it will look more like that middle section).

Last night was perfect. This was another heavy week. I feel helpless, guilty, and afraid of whatall this taking sides will do in our election (and then guilty again becausewhy do I worry about that when children are dying). And then I feel confused because there are wars and dying children all over the world so why doesthis one get to us so much? Oof.

But we are pretty darned excited around here, and Iwanted to write down some of the great things about this amazing season. Non-baseballfolks can feel free to ignore! MLB Records Tied 2019 Minnesota Twins MLBrecord with 307 homers.Team slugging percentage of .501 -highest in MLB historyRonald Acuna is the only player inhistory to get 40 home runs and 70 stolen bases.Ronald is also only the fourthplayer in MLB history to have a 335 average 40 or more homers, 215 hits ormore, 80 extra base hits or more, 100 RBI or more, & 145 runs scored ormore, with fewer than 90 strikeouts. The other three? Lou Gehrig (1937), ChuckCline (1936), & Joe DiMaggio (1937). Matt Olson, Ronald Acuna, & MarcelOzuna all had 40 or more homers – this is the 4th time in MLB history that 3teammates hit 40 or more homers in a single season.Braves Franchise RecordsTied the Braves franchise high with4 players with 100 or more RBI.Matt Olson set a new franchiserecord with his 54 homers.Matt also set a new franchiserecord with 139 RBI.Spencer Strider had a 20 win season& broke the franchise record (set by John Smoltz) with 281 strikeouts.And if these aren’t enough stats, check out thisarticle. The title is “Do Braves have the best first-inning offense ever?” Theanswer is YES, yes they do. The article has stats like this: Most home runs, first inning, since 19611-T. 2023 Braves: 471-T. 2019 Reds: 46 Most extra-base hits, first inning, since 19611-T. 2023 Braves: 921-T. 2003 Cardinals: 923. 2001 Rangers: 89 Highest slugging percentage, first inning, since 19611. 2023 Braves: .6002. 2019 Reds: .564 Highest OPS, first inning, since 19611. 2000 Cardinals: .9882. 2023 Braves: .982 It goes on to say: “If there’s any takeaway from allof this, it’s that the first inning of any Braves game is must-see TV if youlike action. And silencing Atlanta’s offense in the first will be bothextremely difficult and vitally important for any opponent this month. Youdon’t want to let this offense gain the upper hand early on. However, theBraves’ lineup has often been called “relentless” this season, and for goodreason. While keeping them quiet in the first inning is crucial, you still haveto deal with them in innings two through nine as well. Good luck.” The Braves first post-season game is on Saturday. They’llbe playing the Phillies, who are currently on fire. As I told a friend earliertoday, I’m beside myself with joy and dread.

Bliss! (As has happened one other time, it turns out that Dad& Sue are, in fact, NOT joined at the hip. She was gone, but he was in thehouse. Oops.) Thursday, August 17th                       Shared with no commentary.Squares are joined! On to the border! Friday, August 18th                        Propped my feet up & didborder things during my lunch hour.  Saturday, August 11th              Had a pool party with acouple of my oldest friends yesterday (we missed you Sherri!) & had ablast. Showed off the 15 extra pounds I’ve put on this year, got sunburned(forgot to put any sunscreen on my legs 😳), crocheted, ate charcuterie & cookies. It was a goodday! (Bonus content – a photo of me wearing the same swimsuit in 2004. Sufficeit to say that I don’t swim very often.) Meanwhile, Dr. M did someporch sitting with Pop.  Speaking of waffles, I had aFB friend pose the question as to which was superior, waffles or pancakes, andhere was my answer: They are two different things. Sometimes you need the cakeycake of the pancake. Sometimes you need the crunchy squish of the waffle. Theonly thing that’s always true: a quart of butter & syrup on whichever tastytreat you eat. What say you?"},

Hepoked at it & it was a twig. Ha! We had a powerfulthunderstorm blow through with wind gusts of up to 80 mph, and about 4:30 ourpower went out. I went to pick up some takeout for dinner & had some issuesgetting home.  Later, we drove aroundtrying to get a cell signal & chasing the sunset.  Tuesday, August 8th                    Still no power.

I brought home some cold thingsto eat for dinner.  We thought the power wasgoing to come back on by 11:00 that night, but found out at 9:00 pm that we werebeing bumped to the next day. We were afraid that we would lose everything inour deep freeze so I checked with Dad & Sue & they said they had plentyof room. We headed over at 9:30 and got our stuff stashed. Whew! (Note: Dad& Dr. M put the stuff in the freezer – I worked the puzzle).  Wednesday, August 9th                             Still no power in the morning – but miraculouslythere was still enough hot water for my shower. The power came on around 11:30. Dr. M dida little tribute post of all the battery powered lighting we had used – ha! Ithink they look like some sort of steampunk army heading to our rescue. Thursday, August 9th                       Gave in & got my graycovered.  Friday, August 10th                        I took the day off from workto clean out our fridge (since it was a lot emptier after Dr. M got rid ofspoiled food).

Yesterday theyplayed a double header & won the first game 21-3, and the second game 6-0.I think they’re all right. For this coming week I’m going to wish for boring.Nothing dramatic.

Ha! Tuesday, May 16th                  Paper paper paper… This ismaybe 1/6th of the paper we saw. Next year we’ll be doing all thisonline (fingers crossed).  Wednesday, May 17th                            I was headed to bed &knew I hadn’t taken a photo, so here are my tulips which are sliding into MorticiaAddams territory. I love them! Thursday, May 18th                 Daylily!  And here is evidence thatsomeone in our house eats oatmeal the usual way (it was Dr. M). It was the first game ofthis round of the hockey playoffs, but I wasn’t sure I’d be able to stay awakefor the whole thing. Turns out I was right – the game was almost six hours long. They had four overtimes. That’s a whole second game. Andthey lost. But what an epic battle! I went to bed at the end of the firstovertime.  Friday, May 19th                 I talked to So. Many. People.this week. My little introvert self was WHUPPED.  Here I am at the end of the day...Saturday, May 20th         EllenAbbott sent me some oatmeal that had “Seasonal Flavor” on the packets. Shewondered what the heck seasonal flavor was & you know I volunteered to findout.  Meanwhile,Dr. M was out getting groceries for his dad. One of the cats was enjoying theday.  Last week I said that I thought this week would be the last of thereally intense busy days at work. I was wrong – we have another week of prettyhard work (entering all the benefit changes for almost 600 employees), then it should calm down.

Sunday, May 7thSince I think we all needit, you’re getting a double dose of peonies this week. Here’s dose number one,and it’s a beaut. Monday, May 8th             I stopped by dad & Sue’safter work & they showed me this photo of my grandfather’s 5thgrade class. I was sure I knew whichone was him (the boy in the overalls on the far right on the front row). Imean, look at this photoof Papaw & Mamaw – dead ringer, right? But oh my goodness the hue & cryfrom my aunts! My great-grandmother would neverhave let her son go to picture day looking like that! And since I remember thatshe used to sell Mary Kay cosmetics, that’s probably true. So, bowing to theircollective wisdom, I’ll agree that my grandfather is the 3rd from theright on the back row. Cute kid!  Tuesday, May 9th                  After a long work day (that started at 7 a.m.), here is my after dinnersnack – the brownie from one of Dr. M’s frozen dinners with pudding, banana,& cool whip. Delish! Wednesday, May 10th                            The Roy came by for a treat! Thursday, May 11th                 I ate sushi in the car forlunch – it was pretty tasty! Friday, May 12th                 I ordered Dr. M to do a photoshoot of our yard. Look at all this pretty in pinkness! I’m especiallyimpressed with how much peaches has thrived.  Saturday, May 13th         Itook Daddy & Sue out for Mother’s day. We got some excellent flounder &popcorn shrimp & then enjoyed some cupcakes (mine had cookie dough on it) while I worked the puzzle. Ialso got Sue pink hydrangeas, which perfectly matched the dishes she keeps outon their table. Sweet! I made it through week one of work craziness. I have about another weekof intense work, then it will just be extra (not extremely) busy for anotherfew weeks after that.

Sunday, April 30thI was trying to get a videoof this wind chime going crazy (Sunday was just a bit breezy). I wasn’t very successful,but the sky looks nice.  Monday, May 1st            I saw a meme about “thingsfrom the 70s” & had to post this photo of 15 year old me with several ofthose ancient items featured: paneling, rotary phone, photo taken with aPolaroid camera, grown out Dorothy Hamill haircut. Good times! Meanwhile, Dr. M was doing aphoto shoot with our drift rose, Peaches.  Tuesday, May 2nd                  I have a little white boardon my desk where I jot notes to myself. This particular one has been on therefor a couple of weeks & I am at a total loss. There were some great ideasfrom friends on FB (my favorite was related to ovulation, which has not been anissue for me for about 10 years).   Wednesday, May 3rd                           Today’s only photo - I sentDr. M this picture of my ridiculous egg sandwich – I did try to fold it so itwould fit on the bread, but it was out of control.  Thursday, May 4th                 Another food photo – I hadan open faced ham & lima bean sandwich. It was good! Friday, May 5th                 Dr. M & I spent somequality time on the deck after I got home from work.  Saturday, May 6th         Dr.M’s dad’s Dr. Van Fleet rose continues to be lovely! These tulips Dr. M broughthome for me have their arms wide open, all exuberance. They’re saying YES whenI so often want to say no. I think I’ll try to listen to them this week. Well, we just finished watching a 12 inning baseball game (Braves win!),and we’re getting ready to watch the Hurricanes play their 3rd gamein the 2nd round of the playoffs (they won the first two games).Frankly, we’re a nervous wreck.

Their wings go so fast that they look pretty much transparent in thisphoto.  Monday, April 24th           The Dr. Van Fleetrose at Dr. M’s dad’s house is lovely as usual. Tuesday, April 25th                  These photos are actually ondifferent days, but I thought it would be fun to see the evolution of my feetduring the week. The first photo is “WHAT WERE YOU THINKING WOMAN” accompaniedby a space heater. The second one was ok, but these are my winter feet. Is thisnot spring? The third photo is a dorky, but comfortable, compromise.  Wednesday, April 26th                          While walking at the mallwith my bestie, I had to stop and take a photo of the penguin art. Thursday, April 27th                 Dr. M made vegan chili andit was SO GOOD! Of course, by the time I added sour cream, shredded cheese, andtortilla strips, it was no longer vegan. Friday, April 28th                 Sue’s birthday was Thursday,but since she was celebrating with her REAL daughter, I spent time with her& Dad on Friday. We went to the American Legion fish fry (delicious!) andthen came home to have a slice of the birthday cake her daughter gave her. Itwas extra delicious.  After I got home, Dr. M and I watched hockey and the CAROLINA HURRICANES WON THE FIRST ROUND OF THEIR POSTSEASON! There might have been some crazy dancing in our house (I have a memory of Dr. M twerking) - we were amazed and delighted. Saturday, April 29th         Dr.M’s welcoming committee when he came home. I took some treats out there, butthey had to have a good scritch session before thinking about treats. Roy’ssuch a good boy.  Remember how I said that last week was going to be crazy at work?

Woo hoo! Meanwhile,Dr. M was checking out lambs. I got a new Fitbit & spent a Great Deal of Time looking at all the possible Fitbit watch faces.There were fun ones, and classic ones, ones that looked like vintage watches,and ones with mandalas… But I ended up getting this one because it has yarn onit. Ha! I’mgoing to leave you with this little ditty that Dr. M wrote after one stinkbugencounter too many:Stinker in the house,Freaky little pest!Scares me when I'm cookin'So's I makes a mess!Buzzin' 'round the lights,Climbin' up the walls...I'd fling a Nerfie at 'mBut I got no balls!He's why our pots are alwayscovered,He's even landed on my head!Jezzuz what a sleezer,Terror and a teaser,I'll be hidin' in thefreezer'til he's DEAD!!!"},

Firstof all, I thought I’d try stir fried oatmeal for breakfast, but it wasn’treally worth the effort. It was super tasty (especially because “the last bitof cheese” in the bag was probably 1/2 cup). But I can get the same resultsfaster & with less mess in the microwave. We had a potluck at church,and then afterward I went to Dad & Sue’s and FINISHED THE PUZZLE! HUZZAH! Itlooks innocent, but it was a bear. Pretty though. After I got home I worked ona headband while we watched the Super Bowl. It was a good game, but my favoritepart was Sheryl Lee Ralph singing the Black National Anthem (one of myfavorites to sing myself, although I’m not as talented as she is).  Monday, February 13th         Trying to use up the last ofthe gray yarn that I used for last week’s hat, I made a flower applique.

How can wemake that happen? Thursday, February16th                 My bestie got me a newbracelet with this year’s word of the year (walk – as in “in the light” and “moveyour ass” and “with the marginalized” etc.). Also, I took a jillion photostrying to get a selfie and landed on this one, which I captioned: \"Get yousomeone who looks at you the way I look at my phone.\"   Friday, February 17th             Driving to work in thepouring rain, and this song came on. Indeed. That evening Dr. M made mulligatawnysoup! The recipe he used had apples in it and I feel like they made all thedifference. Well, I also enjoyed the dollop of Greek yogurt & cilantro.Yum! Saturday, February18th        Possibly(probably) none of you will care at all about this, but the Carolina Hurricaneshockey team played an outdoor game at NC State’s football field and it wasAMAZING. So much fun. Lots of hoopla, and fun NC State tributes (the openingmontage with Jimmy Valvano was excellent), and the Canes won handily. They havea great team this year. Will we win the Stanley Cup? We shall see! I’mexcited about my upcoming birthday (March 3) because that means we’re inchingcloser to spring and more light and warmer weather. However, I’m already havingallergy issues, which is just rude. I might have to add to my current regimen (Claritin).Do any of you have allergies? What do you do that helps?"},

He’s still got a little carpentrywork to do (the new heater is taller than the old one, so the shelving that wasin the same space has to be adjusted), but at least his dad has hot water. Dr.M is a little wild-eyed in the picture below – ha! I made myself an open facedlivermush sandwich for dinner – toast with Laughing Cow cheese, livermush, andpeas on top. It was SO GOOD! Monday, November 21st   Iwent by Daddy & Sue’s during my lunch hour to work on the puzzle. I thoughtthey’d be gone, but I caught them right before they left to sing with their group.Aren’t they snazzy?Tuesday, November 22nd          We had a meal at work. Itwas really good (chili, with some random side items), but for me the star wasthis homemade carrot cake. I kept telling the coworker who made it “it’s SOGOOD!” It got kind of embarrassing. Ha! Wednesday, November23rd                    Dr. M was in a store buyingflowers for his mother’s grave & they were in full Christmas inflatablemode. This is my favorite.  Thursday, November24th            Thanksgiving! Here are somerandom photos of the day (plus the “official” photo of all of us). I had tolaugh – I went back into my cousin’s office to eat and NO-ONE JOINED ME. I atemy whole meal by myself, reading my book. It was bliss. I wasn’t an entirehermit. I did go out & mingle with folks after I finished eating.  The best part of the day –the blanket in its new home! Friday, November 25th          Dr. M says, “It’s not easybeing green…” Saturday, November26th       Ifinally pulled out a new crochet project (I had joked & told Dr. M that Imight start crocheting again in February). I started this one in 2016, and thenwe moved and I kept pulling it out & doing a smidge & putting it backaway again. Well. I actually finishedit last night! I’ll do a photo shoot with it before I send it to the recipient.It’s sort of a shawl/wrap situation – and is fifteen feet long. I don’t know why – I think the original patterncalled for it to be oversized.  Itold Dr. M that we needed some vegetables in our lives and he delivered! Hecalled it a sort of a spinach tomato corn vegetarian chili vibe. It’s reallytasty – and I plan to have it for dinner again tonight.  It was so nice to be off of work for a coupleof days. I had a handful of projects in mind to do, but of course did none ofthem. I might do one of them this evening – for some reason I can’t find anyblack socks so I need to dump out my sock drawer to see what the heck. Wish meluck. Did you do anything productive over the holiday, or were you a lump likeI was? (Note: I did do laundry & some housework, so not a total lump.)"},

Made me laugh.  Saturday, November19th       Itook the blanket to my cousin’s house so she could play around with “staging”it on her king sized bed. We tried folding it in various ways to see how thatchanged the look. It’s still pretty darned big, but not TOO outrageous on thatbed. I think my other cousin (the one who commissioned it) will be happy withthe end result. I know I’m happy that it’s finished, but also pretty darnedproud of it too.  Dr. M has spent two days at his dad’s housereplacing the hot water heater, so even though I’ve been out & about bothdays I’ve felt like a single lady. I don’t like it. I’m used to him beingaround when I’m at home. It’s like we’re an old married couple or something –ha!

But it was cold, and I wasbored with my other options. Dr. M has been concernedabout getting his dad’s gas fireplace serviced so that the pilot light wouldwork. The guy who usually does it has been very sick, so Dr. M went to GoogleTrade School and figured it out himself. I’m pretty proud of him!  Wednesday, October19th                 My status from FB: This isnot going to turn into a fashion account, but for the second day in a row I’mwearing something weird that I made. And I’m sharing it here so I can tell youthat when I went to go to bed last night I straight up walked right into thebedroom door and sloshed water all over me and my phone and laughed like aloon. I was innocently scrolling Instagram and carrying a glass of water &forgot that the door was shut (because I like to live in Hawaii and sleep inSiberia). I thought it was SO FUNNY. I don’t know why. Dr. M just shook hishead at me. Dr. M found a great deal ona 2017 Ford Escape! And he’s letting making me drive it at least throughthe winter (it’s 4WD!). Oh my goodness – I feel like I’ve dropped into the lapof luxury. This is a huge leap forward from Daisy (2012). I think the featuresI’m most excited about are the dual temperature controls (marriage saver!) andheated seats. (Also, I am very short.)Thursday, October 20th          The only picture I took wasof the magnet Dr. M snuck and put on the back of the new car. I had brought ithome to put on Daisy & kept forgetting.  Friday, October 21st          My nephew’s wife threw asurprise birthday party for him. It was a lot of fun. I especially liked thedouble-decker cookie cake. Yum! Saturday, October 22nd      HartSquare Village is a little over a mile from our house, and yet for somereason we had never attended the living history day that they have each year.Well, I had hip surgery, and then Dr. M had back surgery. Anyway we decidedthat this was the year. They have 103 structures, built between roughly 1760 and 1893,and artisans and docents spread over a pretty large area. We werepretty proud of how well we did walking up and down the trails over some roughterrain. We had a good day and both of us took a lot of pictures. I’m justgoing to share a “few” (ha!) here.  Ofcourse I had to go into the little Episcopal church. The guy in there wasactually playing the organ! Dr.M had to have his photo taken at the Rhyne barn. Not sure exactly when it was built, but thename associated with it is George Pinkney Rhyne (1821-1948). He was Dr. M’s 1stcousin, 4x removed on his mom’s side, but he is also kin to Dr. M on his father’sside (Dr. M’s family tree goes straight up). George’s father, William LawsonRhyne, was Dr. M’s 3rd great-granduncle.  William Lawson Rhyne's father, Jonas, is both Dr.M’s 4th great-granduncle (on the Rhyne side) and his 4th great-grandfather (onthe Friday side)! Confused? So are we! I’msorry Nance – I did pull for Cleveland but to no avail. In fact, it sort offeels like me pulling for someone sounds the death knell on their season.

Sunday, October 9th            As I mentioned last week,Dr. M & I took a little ramble and got lunch at a place by Lake Hickory. Igot the black bean burger. We were both too hungry to photograph the food, but Itook a photo of the menu especially for Nance. Check out that description – ha! Monday, October 10thImade myself a tuna melt for dinner. I took a picture of the open cabinet door& texted Dr. M asking him why I had left it open. It’s not something Iusually do & I was perplexed.Tuesday, October 11th       The Bugly’s last ride. Itstarted overheating on Monday & Dr. M limped it to his dad’s house today sothat he could borrow the truck (Floyd the Ford). He took pictures of all theplaces he had to stop to let it cool down before he could continue. We couldprobably get it fixed, but it’s 18 years old and has over 200,000 miles on it& I think it would be like a game of whack a mole if we started puttingmoney into it. We were (and still are) VERY SAD about this. The Bugly wasProfessor Rhyne’s car at school, and it was our road trip car. It’s going to behard to let go.  Last week I had spent sometime around someone who had COVID, so I tested myself for the first time ever.  Wednesday, October12th                 Dr. M moved Sheepie to Floydand we were all sad again.  Got my hair cut again. Lookat all that gray! Thursday, October 13th          Today was a momentous occasion!I finally reached the point in the blanket where I stopped increasing &started decreasing! According to my calculations it’s going to be 9 feet by 14feet – definitely out-monstering the previous monster (my 2016 temperatureblanket).  Friday, October 14th         I had the day off from workand spent it with my cousin attending the virtual Evolving Faith conference. It was SOGOOD! Man. But it lasted from 9:30 to after 6:00 and I was WIPED OUT. I couldbarely form coherent sentences when I got home. Sorry, Dr. M!  Saturday, October 15th     Iwent back over to my cousin’s house for the morning session. When I was gettingback in the car, Audrey jumped in – twice! She apparently wanted to go homewith me. So adorable.  Dr.M got this nifty BBQ set from his aunt’s house. It’s pretty substantial – we thinkit might be useful in the Zombie Apocalypse too. Now we just need to get agrill. Seattlefans started wearing shoes on their heads for some reason (rally shoes!) andsomewhere around the 15th inning I decided to try it. However, theyended up losing in 18. (Note: I did not wear the shoe the whole time. No doubtthat’s why they lost.)Well,the time of baseball is nearly at an end, and the time of hockey has begun. TheCarolina Hurricanes have won their first two games of the season. Maybe somedayI’ll actually watch a game (their next four games start after 9:00). No worry –the season lasts about four years so I’ll have plenty of chances to watch. Iknow that all four of my readers are just fascinated – ha! What’s keeping you goingthis fall? Candy corn?

{"title": "Book Reviews – the September Edition", "date": "Wednesday, October 12, 2022", "text": "Remember how I only readtwo books in August? I think I know what happened – I had about five going atthe same time, reading a bit in each every day, and then I finally finished themin September. I finished 8 books in September! There are two that I won’t listhere (another enneagrambook, and a book aboutpurity culture in the evangelical church and the global oppression andmistreatment of women – let me know if you’re interested in either one). Thatstill leaves five to review. Borderlines (Joe Gunther #2) ★★★★, by Archer Mayor. In the second book of the series, Joe heads tohis uncle’s home in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom. He’s supposed to just bestaying with him while he helps out a neighboring county with an embezzlingcase. However, almost right away there is an altercation with a local cult, afire, a murder, and some of his old friends are involved up to their necks. Ienjoyed this book as much as the first one. I have the third one on hold at thelibrary – I’ll (of course) let you know how it goes.  Desperationin Death (In Death #55) ★★★, by J. D. Robb. Eve Dallas is searching for a young girl’skiller. She suspects that the girl was being groomed for sex trafficking, and ishaving trouble getting a handle on the case until another young girl comesforward. Another excellent In Death book! Downthe Rabbit Hole (In Death #41.5) ★★★, by J. D. Robb et al. This is a compilation of four shortstories, only one of which is about Eve Dallas. I loved the Dallas one, but theothers were just not up to the same J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts) standards. They weren’tterrible, but they weren’t fabulous. And I had actually read it way back in theday so I probably shouldn’t even count it here. I kept thinking, this allsounds vaguely familiar… Ha!The Power ★★★★, by Naomi Alderman. Sometime in the far distant future, aman sends a manuscript of a book he has written to a woman to get her thoughts. It’sabout the origins of Mother Eve, and how at one point in time men had the upperhand in society. Which seems laughable to the woman reader, but she’s game fora new tale. In the fictional novel, the male author describes how teenage girlssuddenly wake up one day with electricity in their palms; they can zap anyonethey want to & that changes the face of the earth. On the one hand, thisbook was very well written. On the other hand I spent about 80% of it beinghorrified at how women weren’t any better than men once they were in power. I’mstill not sure what I think about it, but it helped a lot when I decided totake it as satire (which was probably not the actual intent). Lilyand the Octopus ★★★★★, by Steven Rowley. Ohwhat a lovely tender, hilarious, heartbreaking, fabulous book this was! Ted hasa dachshund named Lily, and this is his story of his fierce love for her. Itwas very satisfactory (but sad, for sure – be forewarned). And in case you areinterested, the audio narrator was verygood.  I’ve finished two books inOctober, and I’m hoping to finish another one in the next day or two (we shallsee). BUT I’ve started rereading the Eve Dallas books. I’m on the third one(and as you can see up there, there are 55 of them). I might get tired of this,but I wouldn’t count on it. So my next book review post will probably be prettyshort, and the last one for a while. What are you reading?"},

It looked like Thousand Island dressing, but had cream cheese and... and I can't remember. Salsa? No idea. Anyway, I never found that (and it probably wasn't an actual recipe anyway - it probably was on a package of cream cheese or a bottle of whatever sauce went into it (cocktail sauce?). What I did find was a binder with a bunch of random recipes and this recipe card for Fruit Cocktail Cake. I loved that cake and you'd better bet I'm going to try to make it (but do they still make cans of fruit cocktail?). As I recall, it was ooey gooey deliciousness. We shall see. Looking at the recipe gave me all the feels because my mother never could spell vanilla. It made my heart do little backflips to see it misspelled in her usual way, in her handwriting. A little taste of Momcat. P.S. I'm intrigued that she wrote mine, my dad's, and my brother's names on the binder. Was she doodling her most important people? Was she saying - look here, family, I'm collecting recipes for you! As with many things mom related, I'll never know. P.P.S.

Yes, you read that right. And, people. Mistakes were made, but itended up being REALLY REALLY good. We didn’t have any all-purpose flour, anddid you know that self-rising flour really does rise?  I mean, I left out the baking powder &salt like they said to, but we still had a cake volcano.

I’m not goingto include the devotional here since it’s for a pretty specific audience and Idon’t think you guys are into the Enneagram like I am. But let me know – if you’rea 9 I can talk to you about it.  Game On:Tempting Twenty-Eight (Stephanie Plum #28 duh) ★★★★, by Janet Evanovich. In this chapter of the crazy life of StephaniePlum, Bail Bonds Enforcement Agent, she is joined by Diesel (no last name, or no first name - the whole name situation is a bit fuzzy). They are trying totrack down a super computer hacker who is having some serious mental healthissues. Mayhem ensues. And you’d better believe that another of Stephanie’scars bites the dust.   Open Season (Joe Gunther #1) ★★★★, by Archer Mayor. Joe Gunther is a police lieutenant inBrattleboro, VT. In the opening scene an elderly woman shoots an intruder justoutside her home. From there the case takes a very weird turn involving amurder from three years earlier. Someone wants that case opened back up, andthey’re using a very unorthodox method to get the police’s attention. My brotherrecommended this series to me & I think I’m going to like it a lot – I’vealready finished book 2 (you’ll hear about it next month). I’ve already finishedfour books in September and there are still 10 days to go. I’m seriously tryingto figure out what the heck I did in August. Podcasts? Music? Did I reread someold books? At this point, only the Shadow knows… OK, now you tell me what goodstuff you’ve been reading!"},

So are my dad’s. Anyone needany grapes? Wednesday, September14th                I went by my dad’s at lunchto work the puzzle (and visit of course) and they told me about the surprise ontheir chimney.

Yeah, that’s what happened.  Friday, September 16th         Day off from work breakfast(which, I confess, I ate for three days in a row): Spinach pizza, black beans, fried egg, sour cream and taco sauce. It was GOOD. Spent the morning cleaningout my car. It was SO DISGUSTING that even I started noticing (mainly from leaves and gum wrappers which I THOUGHT I was throwing in the trash. And dust). Ugh. But it’sall shiny inside now. And bonus – I found the piece of Ruth Bader Ginsberg’srobe that we were missing in this puzzle. The big question is: how did it getunder the driver’s seat?  Saturday, September17th       Itwas my dad’s birthday! In his usual dad way he took ME out to eat to celebrate.We went to Panera because he had seen a commercial with a chicken sandwich thathe wanted to try. Although Sue and I loved our lunches, he decided the chickensandwich was middlin. After lunch Sue went to a shower and Dad & I wentback to his house to eat pudding cake and work the puzzle.  Laterthat day Dr. M took some photos of our asters and VERY BUSY sedum – it wasgetting all the love! Ileft to have dinner with friends (we watched Kim Jane’s daughter’s weddingvideo & looked at pictures – so fun), but Dr. M had a visitor so he wasn’talone. Itook a photo of a photo on Kim’s camera roll – this is from the day before the wedding when Iwas helping with set-up. Ha! Tomorrow we’re doing more birthday celebratingwith my dad, and it looks to be a busy week at work. I’m already pre-tired –especially because I woke up at 7:30 this morning after going to bed aftermidnight. Rude. How are you feeling heading into the week?

I really like it! Iespecially like being able to look down the hall to see what’s going on in thelobby.  Dr. M had a half of a biscuitleft from his breakfast & I stole it to make a sort of strawberry shortcakesituation.

These are terrible photos –maybe I’ll do a dual new office new hair photo shoot next week.  Flowers from the deck,looking a little bedraggled.  Saturday, September3rd          Dr.M did some porch sitting with his dad.  Itook a not very good picture of our spider friend.  Andthen when Dr. M came home he had a visitor!

As I said on FB, this puzzle’s fate is similar to the FarmBoy’s fate in Princess Bride. Dread Pirate Roberts: “Good night, Westley. Goodwork. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning.” Then I came home& worked on another beast. Monday, August 15th  Terriblephoto of excellent chicken fried rice.

I have ALL KINDS OFFEELINGS about this whole situation. Mission work in general is a complexminefield to me, and wearing an \"African outfit\" for Halloween is allkinds of nope to me now. Also, are those OCTOPI on that fabric? What in theworld! On the other hand, I was so thrilled to fit back into that dress. Friday, August 19th        Had the day off from workand ordered new glasses, worked on the puzzle some more at my dad’s house (Suemade me another grilled cheese sandwich – yum!), and was in line at thepharmacy when one of my friends posted that it was World Photography Day & forus to post our photographs.

So, I will probably write it in chunks and then try to get itposted by the end of the month. OR I’ll finish it right now. We’ll see! Busted (Will Trent #6.5) ★★★★, by Karin Slaughter. Will Trent is on his way to an undercoverassignment when he makes an ill-fated decision to get an Icee at a conveniencestore. While he’s waiting on the machine to work someone comes in to rob thestore, and all heck breaks loose & basically doesn’t stop until the (verysurprising) end. A nice little short story romp into Will’s world that Ilistened to while waiting on another book to become available from the library. The Maid ★★★★, by Nita Prose.  Molly Gray is on the autism spectrum(I think – the word autism is never mentioned) and her way of looking at theworld is a bit different. She’s a maid at a swanky hotel and LOVES her job. Hermain goal in life is to return each room to a “state of perfection.” One dayshe enters the room of a frequent guest and finds him dead. Due to a series ofunfortunate events she ends up being charged with the crime. It took me a whileto get into the book, but I reached a point where I was VERY HOOKED. I wasinvested in making sure that Molly didn’t pay for a crime she didn’t commit.Even though I wasn’t 100% sure she didn’t commit it. Lots of twists & turns– I recommend you check this one out.GoodEnough: 40ish Devotionals for a Life of Imperfection ★★★★, by Kate Bowler and Jessica Richie. Kate Bowler knows alot about imperfection – she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer a fewyears ago. She has a whimsical way of writing, and her Instagram blessings arefabulous. This book has chapters like, Mourninga Future Self (about a future that will now not happen because circumstanceshave changed), and The Tragedy Olympics.At the end of each chapter is a blessing, and a “good enough step” with a practicalthing to do. Here’s one of the blessings: A Prayerfor When You Don’t Know What to Say Blessed are you when you realize you are wayout of your depth and you have no idea what to say. Blessed are you, confrontedwith suffering you can’t imagine, but you don’t say it. You do not say youcan’t imagine their pain, because you do want to imagine. You want to be therewith them, in your heart and mind, imagining what they are feeling and whatthey might need. Blessed are you there, silently, longing to bring comfort andease. Your presence itself is prayer, and may the words that come be simple: Iam so sorry. I love you. You are not alone. Blessed are you who refuse to jointhe throng of the un-suffering. But choose instead to hurt beside thosesuffering. And love them right there without fixing or teaching or rescuing orbright-siding. Blessed are you, there. In the love that waits for the dawn.Amen. Yellow Wife ★★★★★, by Sadeqa Johnson. This book is about a slave girlwho is sent to jail to be sold as a fancy girl. However, the master of the jaildecides to make her his “wife.” The story is about all that she does to surviveand keep her children safe. I was going to say that I had some “white woman’stears” as I read this, and yes I did cry. But my over-arching feeling was RAGE.How in literal God’s name did people think chattel slavery was ok? Such a toughread, but such a good story, well told, about a time in our history that I don’twant swept under the rug.   This HereFlesh: Spirituality, Liberation, and the Stories That Make Us ★★★★★, by Cole Arthur Riley. Here is partof the book description from Goodreads: “[The author] boldly explores some of the most urgent questions of lifeand faith: How can spirituality not silence the body, but instead allow it tocome alive? How do we honor, lament, and heal from the stories we inherit? Inthis indelible work of contemplative storytelling, Arthur Riley invites us toponder the site of soul by examining our capacity to rest, wonder, joy, rage,and repair, and finding that our humanity is not an enemy to faith but evidenceof it.” This is a GORGEOUS book. I highlighted the heck out of it, but hereis just one excerpt: “Iwant a faith that loves the whole of me. And if I make it to the table of God,I hope it has cornbread stuffing and comfortable chairs. I mean no offense tothe desert mothers and fathers eating locusts and honey and itching with camelhair, but I hope God knows how my cousin’s baked mac and cheese tastes. I hopehe puts ham hocks in his greens and feels no shame.” Whew. READ IT.  Caraval (Caraval #1) ★★★, by Stephanie Garber. Scarlett Dragnalives on the Conquered Isle of Treesda (sp? Not sure – I listened to it) withher sister Donatella. They are oppressed by their father and dream of attendingCaraval – an annual performance where audience members participate. On the eveof Scarlett’s arranged marriage they finally receive their coveted invitations,but immediately upon arrival Tella is kidnapped as part of this year’s performance.Scarlett has to find her sister to win this year’s prize – one wish. Scarlettworries too much and takes too long to find her own voice, Tella seems like aspoiled brat, and the “clues” for the mystery seem to not actually leadanywhere. But it was an interesting enough story that I might read the secondbook. We shall see! Well, as I expected Iwould, I wrote this all at the same time and will go ahead & post.

It mostly looks like a jumbled mess.And now I get to crochet another one just like it! And THEN I get to assemblethe two of them into a complicated design for an afghan square. Sometimes Iwonder if I’m right in the head (the answer is that none of us are, but some ofus are less right than others). Sunday, July 10th         I tried very hard to capture the glory that is (are?) my new Feryl Designs earrings. Theychange in the light & I think they are magnificent.  Monday, July 11thInSunday’s photos you can see a bit of my new polka dot dress. I wore it again to work onMonday & this is what it looks like. I love it.  Itwas Family Mexican night. I love spending time with Daddy, Sue, my brother, andhis wife, but I also love havingleftover Mexican food for lunch the next day. Tuesday, July 12th      I was influenced by a coupleof separate people on Instagram that raved about a carpetcleaning product. This whole rug really needs to be cleaned, but it also hada lot of random spots on it from the previous owner (I love the colors, andhave always been too trifling to care about the stains because that wouldrequire work on my part). I think this cleaner did a pretty good job! I need towork on it a little more, and then do an allover clean. More later! Wednesday, July 13th           No photo. Thursday, July 14th        Random flowers from theyard, plus one bumblebee on the anise hyssop.  Friday, July 15th        Traffic jam on my way towork! One of my high school classmates says this happens all the time on thisroad, but it was the first time I’ve had to stop for pigs. Ha! Saturday, July 16th        In the gloaming… YesterdayI spent some more time working on the rug, which required squatting (for abouttwo seconds before I gave up & just sat down). Oh my goodness – I’m so soretoday! I really (really really) need to start moving my body more and workingout with light weights. Stretching & walking and lifting must commence or I’mgoing to be that little old lady who has trouble getting out of her chair. Whoam I kidding – I already have to hoist myself up and I really don’t weigh THATmuch. Pathetic. How about you – do you have a regular workout regimen, or areyou naturally fit? I know at least three of you spend your days doing thingsthat keep you in shape."},

Now you can’t saythat THIS one is weird.  Monday, July 4thDr.M brought home the last of the blueberries from his dad’s bush. It’s alwayssuch a treat! (Although I feel bad because MY dad also has blueberries – but Ithink that he & Sue are able to eat those). Itook a meander through the yard.  ThenI worked on unclogging the vacuum (the label is a LIE).

Firstly, as we werewalking into the mall I realized that I had put my pants on backwards which Ithink caused me to fall rather spectacularly. Even though it seemed to happenin slow motion, my cousin didn’t get a video, but she did take this photo. Wecut the walk short so I could come home & ice various body parts. Pro tip,people: pick up your feet while you walk!! (Note: this photo is kind of cute,but the first picture showed my actual 2 foot wide thighs & my cousin didwhat any friend would do & took a different picture. Thanks Kim!) Thursday, July 7th        I was a little sore the dayafter The Fall (Friday was worse), but I only had this one bruise. Which is a mystery because Idon’t think I landed on this arm. Did I hit the wall? I was trying to reach thewall, but I didn’t think I made it. The image of me careering toward the wall,perhaps windmilling my arms, just has me cackling. Also really glad I didn’tbreak anything! Friday, July 8th        Stopped by my dad’s & wefinished the puzzle my nephew & his girlfriend gave me for Christmas. Isn’tit fabulous? It’s Ruth and Malala and Rosa and Harriet and Amelia.  Saturday, July 9th        Dr. M took a turn around theyard before he headed to his dad’s. It’s still so pretty around here.  Fridaywas my coworker’s last day, so this coming week will be interesting and a challenge.We really turned to her every day to help with all kinds of issues and now we’llhave to think for ourselves. Also, I’ve applied for her job (interview on the20th!) so I might end upbeing the one answering questions. That seems perilous for all concerned.

{"title": "Book Reviews – the June Edition", "date": "Thursday, July 7, 2022", "text": "I got back into theswing of reading things in June, so buckle up!  Wolfsong (Green Creek #1) ★★★★, by T. J. Klune. Ox is “different.” He lives in a small town inthe Pacific Northwest, has very few friends, and was abandoned by his fatherwhen he was 12. When he turned 16 he met a boy, Joe, who took him home to meethis family. I don’t think I’m giving much away when I say that the family membersare all werewolves. There are trials and tribulations, and Ox becomes somethinghe never thought he could. The relationship between him and Joe is “complicated”and toward the end of the book I was OMGBLUSHINGWHATTHEHECKAMIREADING!!! What I’msaying is if you’re not into steamy sex scenes maybe don’t read this book. Butit was so good! I loved how Ox grew into his own person. Note: This is the sameauthor as The House by the Cerulean Seaand while I might recommend that book for middle schoolers, I maybe wouldn’tthis one.  Weather Girl ★★★★, by Rachel Lynn Solomon.  Ari Abrams is a meteorologistwho has a dream job at a tv station with her childhood hero. However, the heroand her ex-husband (who also works at the station) are making life miserablefor everyone around them. Ari and sports newscaster Russell cook up a scheme tomake them like each other again. Shenanigans ensue. This book was a lot of fun,and also had some pretty steamy sex scenes (steamy for me – just call me GrannyBug). Stateof Terror ★★★★, by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Louise Penny. TheSecretary of State of the brand new administration is working hard to instillconfidence in the US after four years of a nightmare administration (soundfamiliar?). Then bus bombs start going off in random cities in Europe. Thisbook is fast paced and kept me very interested – plus there were cameos by thecharacters from Louise Penny’s Gamache books which I thoroughly enjoyed. I lovethe humor she brings to her writing, even if the story is about terrorism.  Nightwork ★★★★, by Nora Roberts. This is one of Nora’sstand along novels and it was, as usual, excellent. In this one, Harry Boothstarts doing “nightwork” (liberating rich people of treasure) as young boy as away to help out his mother as she battled cancer. It turned out he was verygood at it, and so he continued even as he grew up and went to college. He metthe love of his life, but almost immediately he had to abandon her because thewrong person required his services. I thoroughly enjoyed Harry and his love interest,and the other characters that Nora likes to include in her books.  Bloodless (Aloysius Pendergast #20) ★★★★, by Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston. Thisis the book I was listening to when I made the face in my last post. Two bodieshave turned up in Savannah with every last drop of blood drained from them.What in the world could have happened? Rest assured, Pendergast and his cohortfigure it out, but it’s pretty darned gross in the meantime. OK, it’s only grossa few times. Regardless, it’s another fine addition to the Pendergast saga. Andthere’s a special surprise at the end which makes me eager to read the nextone! I’ve finished two booksalready in July, and expect to finish another couple before the end of themonth. What are you reading lately?"},

I waslistening to the latest Pendergast book and as usual something disgusting washappening. Later in the week I broke my rule about not eating whilereading/listening to Pendergast books and I had Very Real Regrets. (But thebook was excellent!) Tuesday, June 28th      I’ve started putting my eyemakeup on first (because I saw someone else do it – in case any of the eyemakeup gets on her face), and I was on my way to work when I realized that Icompletely forgot to put on the rest of my makeup. Ha! I guess you can’t undo 40years of doing something the same way that quickly.  I just LOVE these giantyellow daylilies! Stopped by my dad’s house onthe way home & took a photo of his gorgeous blue hydrangea.   Wednesday, June 29th           It’s morning glory season. Forsome reason I just love the white center. I find it a bit mesmerizing.  Scenes from Dr. M’s dad’shouse – with two different colors of hydrangea.  The Roy showed up & gotwhat he came for – treats and lots of pats by Dr. M. Thursday, June 30th        Well, see, I was just ratherenthusiastically eating Cheetos at my desk at work, and somehow flang one intomy cleavage. Sexy, no? Friday, July 1st       No photo.   Saturday, July 2nd       More macro photos fromaround the yard. It sure is pretty around here.  I sent this video to theperson for whom I’m making this blanket. She’s pretty happy with it – I justhope she doesn’t mind that it’s taking forever to make. Each row takes about 40minutes to crochet now.  Tomorrowis the 4th of July and I am very glad to be off of work. And I’mhappy to celebrate the grand experiment that is the United States – I just wishwe could live up to our potential a little better.

And I stillconsider myself to be an Evangelical (sort of). This decision that overridesRoe v. Wade will cause death and misery. Especially because there aren’t enoughservices in place to help women and families who are forced to have babies. Notto mention the women who might die due to complications from a dangerouspregnancy. I could write a novel, but I won’t.  On the other hand, we madeMexican Street Corn in the air fryer, and watched Freddie Freeman get his WorldSeries ring (it’s the first time he was back in Atlanta since he traitorouslywent to the Dodgers).  Saturday, June 25th      The Roy says, “Can Dr. Mcome out & play?” Workhas gotten chaotic again.

{"title": "Book Reviews – the April/May Edition", "date": "Thursday, June 9, 2022", "text": "Well this is going to beshort & sweet. April & May were so busy that when I wasn’t working Iapparently didn’t want to have anything to do with reading. Well, and I alsoreread a couple of books that aren’t going to be listed here.  The MatzahBall ★★★★, by Jean Meltzer. A Jewish best-sellingChristmas romance novelist is asked by her publisher to write a Hanukkahromance. She is flummoxed at the idea because even though she’s Jewish shedoesn’t find Hanukkah very romantic. Then she comes up with a brilliant (toher) idea – finagle her way into an old boyfriend’s Matzah Ball (a party forJewish people to make up for not getting to go to Christmas parties). Shenanigansensue. In a lot of ways this was a traditional romance romp – but the maincharacter has Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and it was handled so nicely. I likedthe dash of realism.  The Lincoln Highway ★★★★★, by Amor Towles.  This is the same author who wrote AGentleman in Moscow which I loved, andthis one is just as good. It starts out in 1954 in Nebraska, where 18 year old Emmetthas come home from a work farm after serving a sentence for manslaughter. Hefather recently died & the family farm is about to be foreclosed, so heplans to head west with his 8 year old brother to seek his fortune. However,two “friends” show up after breaking out of the work farm and things don’t goas Emmett planned. For one thing, he & his brother end up riding to NYC ina boxcar. One theme that runs through the book is the Odyssey, and that’s exactlywhat this is. Each chapter takes up the story through a different character’s eyes.I listened to the audio book, which I highly recommend.   AccidentallyEngaged  ★★★★, by Farah Heron. Reena Manji is atypical Muslim single woman living in Toronto – her parents are very investedin her life. Which is why she wants nothing to do with the latest man that they’vedecided to fix her up with. Except, even though he has a lot of secrets, he isvery cute and their personalities click. Plus Reena loves to bake break andNadim loves to eat her bread. Then an opportunity comes up to enter a cooking showcontest, but it requires that Reena be part of a couple, and Nadim is perfectlyhappy to pretend to be engaged to her. I thoroughly enjoyed Reena and Nadim! CitizenK-9  ★★★, by David Rosenfelt. The K Team – a privatedetective team that includes a retired police officer and his K-9 partner – is hiredto crack a cold case about a couple of people who disappeared from a class reunion7 years ago. The mystery was actually pretty interesting – I didn’t guesswhodunnit until the very end. But I much prefer Rosenfelt’s other series aboutAndy Carpenter the attorney. His wife Laurie is part of the private detectiveteam, but I guess I like Andy better than I like her. Ha! I’ve finished two booksso far in June, but lord a mercy they are both QUITE spicy.

Ha! Meanwhile, seen around ouryard.  Wednesday, May 4th        I really wanted to waituntil the pollen had calmed down, but since the phoebe babies fledged I decidedthat I should clean all their “gifts” off of my car.  Thursday, May 5th      No photo.  Friday, May 6th     Peaches has really startedshowing off! I love how she still has that heart shape.  I was in a shop near theoffice when everyone’s phones started going off with this alert. It was kind offunny with all of us looking down at our phones – and loud. They shut the doors, but did any of us stop shopping? No wedid not.  Saturday, May 7th       I went to a luncheon at Sue’schurch (which was put on by my friend Jenny of the fabulous shoes). We had areally nice time. At our table was a woman who grew up with my mom & talkedabout all the fights she used to get into with “those Foxes” (my mom & hercousins). For family members reading this, the lady was Evelyn, Minnie Fisher’sdaughter. It was a hoot! Since it was Mother’s Dayweekend I decided to wear my mom’s birthstone ring (I’m the March stone). It’sbeen 17 years since we lost my mom and I don’t usually feel all those bigfeelings anymore (my grief tends to show up on a random Tuesday instead).  Dr. M brought home flowersfor me – which was the nicest unexpected gift. Thanks Sweetie! TodayI went with Sue and my sister-in-law to see Mamma Mia at our local communitytheater. As usual, I was annoyed that I had agreed to go, but of course it wasa lot of fun once I was there. I’ll try to remember that the next time someoneasks me to do something. Are you a homebody like I am, or do you like to be out& about?"},

And boy did I stand out! Wednesday, April 27th        Seen around the yard. It wasnice to see all this beauty since my prayer sister from church passed away inthe wee hours of the morning. She’d been sick for a number of months. She was 81,but it was still too soon! The latest two squares formy Irish wool blanket.  Thursday, April 28th      The Sweet William looking alittle less Seussian. Friday, April 29th     Dr. M worked hard making hisworld famous French Toast Casserole for a brunch that I was attending onSaturday. He is the absolute best.  Saturday, April 30th       Brunch! This was for my bestfriend’s daughter who is getting married later in May. The French toast was ahit, and I came home with two pots of petunias as a thank you for Dr. M. Meanwhile, Dr. M grabbedthis last photo of the phoebe babies – they fledged later in the day & nowthe nest is empty.  I spent the evening froggingthis wrap. I was pretty sure I’d made some errors along the way, but it was thejanky edges that made me decide to frog it. This is mohair yarn, so that was aLOT of fun. Fortunately I was able to start back crocheting around 9:00, payinga lot better attention to what the edges look like! Ourdirector’s last day was Friday (she retired), and it was also the last dayfor one of our HR generalists, so I’m a little afraid of what tomorrow will belike at work.

Look at that grumpy face as I drove to church over two hours earlierthan usual (we met outside at 8:30). But it was lovely! The weather wasperfect, the accordion seemed extra festive, the pastor having to wearsunglasses was fun, and the breakfast we had afterword was a nice time offellowship.

{"title": "Book Reviews – the March Edition", "date": "Wednesday, April 20, 2022", "text": "Itis the middle of April and I’m posting my book reviews. What in the world hasgotten into me, being all efficient for a change.  Daughterof the Morning Star(Walt Longmire #17) ★★★★★,by Craig Johnson. Jaya Long, a starhigh school basketball player, has been receiving death threats,which started after her sister disappeared. Walt is enlisted to be her “bodyguard”in the hope that his notoriety will cause people to notice the plight ofdisappearing Indian women. Of course, he solves the mystery (the mystery of the death threats and the sister's disappearance, not the mystery of  the disappeared Indian women - that is ongoing) with the help ofhis friend Henry and some Indian mysticism. As usual, an excellent book – very different than what you might expect from a book about a western sheriff.  AnAmerican Marriage ★★★★,by Tayari Jones.  Roy and Celestial are practicallynewlyweds when their lives are turned upside down by a random encounter. The booktells their story, through letters, and through the eyes of each of the threemain characters (yes, there’s a triangle). At one point I was pretty sure thatI didn’t like any of them. But the story was very engaging, and the ending wasunexpected (and satisfactory to me).  Abandonedin Death (InDeath #54) ★★★★★, by J.D.Robb. Asusual, this book starts with a murder. But pretty quickly it turns into asearch for missing women. The clock is ticking (when is the clock ever notticking?). This was another satisfactory edition of the Eve Dallas series. Ifind it hard to believe that I’ve read 54 of them (and a few years ago I rereadthem all – sheesh!).   Shoutin' in the Fire: An American Epistle★★★★★, by DantéStewart. This is a story of how Dante’ Stewart learned to love blackness. Hegrew up steeped in the Pentecostal tradition, but when he went to play footballat Clemson he turned away from that legacy and embraced white evangelicalism.He worked hard to fit into that world, but when there were more and more unfoundedkillings of black people he slowly began to realize that that world wouldn’t bethere for him or his black brothers and sisters. I first came to know Dante’through his amazing Instagram posts (here is a link to anexample). I listened to the audio version of this book, which was read by him,and it was excellent.  TheHouse in the Cerulean Sea ★★★★★, by T.J. Klune. “Linus Baker leads a quiet, solitary life. At forty, he lives in a tinyhouse with a devious cat and his old records. As a Case Worker at theDepartment in Charge Of Magical Youth, he spends his days overseeing thewell-being of children in government-sanctioned orphanages.” Linus is summonedby Extremely Upper Management and ordered to go to a remote island and check onthe status of the EXTRA ordinary magical youth kept there. This book is justmagical. I loved every little thing about it – how very very good Linus is, howeach child has a distinct personality separate from whatever their magical “gift”is, the diversity of the personalities, and the lovely little twist at the end.READ IT! (Sorry to shout.)              I’mpretty sure I’ll have far fewer books to review next month. I’ve only finished oneso far. I got all of these books to read during Lent and then I totallyrebelled and only read parts of them. Perhaps now that Easter is over I’ll goback to them. Maybe I didn’t like being bossed by the Lent Fairy (is there aLent Fairy?). ANYWAY, what are you reading?"},

I think this is the third or fourth year she has nested onthe light in the carport. She seems to tolerate us a little more this year (althoughwe think the babies have hatched, so she might be more protective now).  Monday, April 11th  We leave the hanging basket on the crook overwinter to balance out the bird feeder, and give the birds somewhere to perchwhile they wait their turn. It’s blooming now, so Dr. M calls it Not Dead Fred. Ha! Tuesday, April 12thWent by Daddy & Sue’splace to finish this beast. It’s 1000 pieces, and seemed a lot harder than mostof the ones we’ve worked lately. All that greenery, and the same flowers oneither side of the puzzle… We are VERY HAPPY that it’s done now!

Clockwise from top left: flowering dogwood, azalea, apple tree, and somelittle yellow invasive weed that we think is pretty. Thursday, April 14th    Dr. M watched this fellowwalking around in the rain.  Friday, April 15th    Azalea close-up withbumblebee. The wildflowers I plantedare starting to come up. And last year’s crop is looking very interesting! Thefront bed is bee balm central – we’ll have to get a photo of it.Sue had surgery on Thursday(she’s doing well) and they ended up keeping her Friday night too, so I madethe trip to Charlotte to take her a few things that she needed. I parked in theBlueberry section – so much easier to remember than Section 5E or whatever.  Saturday, April 16th       Close-up of the volunteerflowering dogwood at Dr. M’s dad’s house – the blossoms are 2-3 inches across! I had a wedding shower toattend and although I bought wrapping paper and bows, I didn’t see any ribbon Iliked. Rather than go to another store I spent two hours making “ribbon.” I don’tknow – my brain is kind of weird. (Kudos to Dr. M for wrapping the gifts forme!).Here are ¾ of the four college musketeers! Kim (middle) is the mother of the bride and my best friend. Jenny(left) is our college friend and wedding planner (she helped plan my weddingway back in the day, although her sister was the one in charge). And this is aterrible photo of the very cute couple. They’d just opened a quilt panel madeby a friend from a picture of their new dog – it was a very tender vittlesmoment.  Oneof the people who was leaving our department has decided to stay(thankyoujesus), but now I’m in the middle of open enrollment. I spent thispast week printing out packets for 600 employees & stuffing them intoenvelopes (the packets, not the employees). I had help, but on Wednesday I hadhit my step goal by 3:00. I was SO EXHAUSTED. I don’t usually have that muchmanual labor all at one time. The next two weeks will be full of answering questions,sorting out returned paperwork, and getting ready for all the data entry. Itwill be crazypants. But we have a system so hopefully I won’t be crazypants.(Let’s face it – I will be crazypants.) So, what’s going on with you?"},

Sunday, April 3rd     Things I did on Sunday: mallwalked with my dad (I apologize for the just-rolled-out-of-bed face), took a pictureof a robin in one of his trees (yes it’s there), ate a Nutty Mixed Up Saladfrom Jason’s Deli (you are what you eat), worked the Thomas Kincaid puzzle fromhell (no photo), and planted some wildflowers (that may or may not actuallygrow). It was a good day! Monday, April 4th  BlueMoon Phlox! Yes, it’s really purple. No I don’t know why its name is Blue. Weespecially like the little tightly curled petals before they open up.  Tuesday, April 5thI was so tired Tuesday eveningthat I put my day moisturizer on instead of my night one (the main differenceis that the day one has sunscreen). I asked people on social media if it mightkeep me awake, but the response mostly seemed to be that I’m a drama queen. Can’targue with that! Wednesday, April 6th        The recipient of my otherscarf giveaway posted a picture – I was glad to see that it arrived! Thursday, April 7th    Opening day!! I loved thatthey had Joey Votto mic’d up. He used to be someone who was very taciturn, buthe’s decided to change his image & he is hilarious. It was a fun night.  I posted these photos on myEnneagram 9 page talking about how I’ve been switching up the glasses that Iwear & that no one had commented on it (the consensus is that people eitherdon’t notice things like that, or that since you can get frames pretty cheaplythese days people wear different glasses all the time). But what struck me asfunny is that people kept saying they liked the “black” glasses better. People.I guess they are black, but they have a blue pattern on the temples so in myhead they have always been blue. So the moral of the story is why should Iexpect that people notice my glasses when I don’t even notice what color theyare? Ha! Friday, April 8th    Dr. M’s mother’s azalea isjust gorgeous! Saturday, April 9th       My latest culinary creation –sliced apple, lemon pepper tuna, & cheddar melt sandwich. I fixed it in theair fryer and it was FABULOUS. The best part was the crunchy cheese. Yum! Meanwhile, Dr. M caught thisbluebird out front. He is so bright! Thingsare a little fraught at work. We are a small department (9 team members) and bythe end of this month we will have lost four of them, including our directorand assistant director. And benefit open enrollment for 600 employees starts nextweek (I’m in charge of this process). I alternate between panic and remindingmyself that I am Not In Charge of the whole department and to just keep doing what I do. Oof.  Are you facing anything scary lately?"},

I have two scarves that need a new home. The first one is a smallerversion of the #kbbshawlthat I made for myself. It’s the exact same colors, but the black yarn I usedwas super fine instead of fine, which made the shawl into more of a scarf. It’sreally soft & (I think) fun. The other item can be worn as a scarf or acowl. I love it, but it turns out it doesn’t really match anything I wear. If you want either or both of these let meknow.

Atlee solvesthe mystery of her sister and her parents in these two installments. I reallyenjoyed the third book because it was a John Puller crossover, but the fourth bookwas pretty darned good too. You do have to suspend reality quite a bit – but that’swhat reading is for, right?   OldMusic for New People ★★★★★, by David Biddle.  Istarted following Jesse Biddle (former Atlanta Braves relief pitcher) onInstagram, and he shared some things that his dad posted which I liked so Istarted following him too. And lo and behold he is an author! I absolutelyloved this novel, which is about a summer in the life of Ivy Scattergood andher family. They are spending the summer in Maine as they always do. This yearthey have an unexpected guest: her cousin Robert. Except that on the flight fromCalifornia Robert transformed into Rita. It’s a summer of self-discovery foralmost all the Scattergoods as they try to figure out what they think abouttheir transgender cousin and it is just fabulous. I wasn’t even annoyed thatthe main character was a teenage girl (they are usually Very Annoying to me). TheVery Good Gospel: How Everything Wrong Can Be Made Right  ★★★★★, by Lisa Sharon Harper. This book is an exploration ofwhat it might look like to bring shalom to the world (actual shalom). From theGoodreads blurb: A Vision of Hope for aBroken WorldShalom is what God declared. Shalom is what the Kingdom of God looks like.Shalom is when all people have enough.It’s when families are healed.It’s when churches, schools, and public policiesprotect human dignity.Shalom is when the image of God is recognized in every singlehuman.Shalom is our calling as followers of Jesus’s gospel. Itis the vision God set forth in the Garden and the restoration God desires forevery relationship.Doesn’t that sound amazing? This is what it would looklike if we quit using scripture for our own ends and actually did what Jesuswould do. I’ve finished threebooks so far in March. It’s looking like I’ll get another couple finished by theend of the month so I’m just trucking along this year. Unless something crazyhappens I might actually meet my book reading goal.

The service was verycool because we wrote down challenges that we were planning to face during thisseason and then put the paper into this bowl of water where it just dissolved.  Thursday, March 3rd.  Birthday flowers from mysweetie (he’s the best). My birthday is always during Lent, so maybe that’s whyit’s my favorite part of the church year. I struggle with belief becausesometimes the Christian faith seems like a lot of hooey. But on the days that Ibelieve, I am drawn to the quietness of this time of contemplation and selfexamination. I’ve signed up for (I think) four different Lenten meditations. ByEaster I’ll be in full belief mode which will last until Christmas. Then I’lljust shake my head at all the folderol until Lent comes around again. Things I did on my birthday:Sat outside & crocheted on the deck, wound some yarn, read a book, ate abig ole bowl of fruit, went to dinner with daddy & Dr. M (Sue wasfeeling poorly), had a birthday eclair & worked a puzzle. Not pictured:watched what purported to be a hockey game. It was a good day! Friday, March 4th    Went on a mini ramble withDr. M. It was a beautiful day! Also, it’s too bad that henbit isn’t a cash cropbecause it sure is pretty.  Dr. M made butternut squashsoup from scratch & it was DELICIOUS! Saturday, March 5th     I took Thursday & Fridayoff of work and spent a good bit of that time, and Saturday, crocheting. I’llbet you know what these squares represent – another Moogly crochet alongblanket! This will be my 12th (I think – I’ve lost track). I’m usingup a big ole bin of Irish wool that was given to me so the colors will befunky. We shall see. Also, these squares haven’t been blocked yet (I need toget some actual wool soak of some kind because the wool feels like it still haslanolin in it). I’ma little annoyed that I have to go back to work tomorrow. However, my crochethand will be glad of the reprieve. Also, I spent a lot of time on the deck andmy body has been reminding me that I have spring allergies so it will be goodto spend most of the day inside my office. These are the stories I’m tellingmyself. What stories do you tell yourself to get pumped up for the week ahead?"},
{"title": "Book Reviews – the December/January Edition", "date": "Wednesday, March 2, 2022", "text": "So, apparently this isan every other month post now. I almost decided to just quit messing with it,but these little “reviews” are helpful for me when I’m trying to remember abook later.  Midnight Bayou ★★★★, by Nora Roberts. I reread this book from 2001 & it was almost like it wasbrand new! A lawyer from up north buys an old plantation house which, ofcourse, has ghosts. There is definitely an element of possession (but you willbe surprised at who is possessing whom). It was a fun light read with the usualNora Roberts conversational style which I enjoy.AMinute to Midnight (Atlee Pine #2) ★★★, by David Baldacci.  FBI agent AtleePine heads to her hometown in Georgia to start unraveling the mystery of her twinsister who was abducted when they were six years old. There was a lot of “youhave got to be kidding me” in this book, but it moved the mystery along and Iended up finishing the series (4 books – you’ll hear about them next month).  FourHundred Souls: A Community History of African America, 1619-2019 ★★★★★, edited by Ibram X. Kendi & Keisha N. Blaine. Thisis a compilation of 90 essays that showcase various points of the African experiencein America. It is so good! I listened to the audio version, which made everyessay fresh and they were all fabulous. This is from my review on Instagram: At the end I felt so much despair about how much haschanged and how much has STAYED THE SAME. Racism really is embedded in thefabric of our nation - in every institution, law, and white heart (no matterhow “woke”).There are poems as well as essays, and the beginning of one (AND THE RECORDREPEATS by Chet’la Sebree) just gutted me: “There’s dust, a scratch in agroove, and here we are repeating the same two seconds of ‘Strange Fruit.’”And this, the end of the last essay, written by Keisha N. Blaine: “This dreamis not yet a reality. We have much work left to do. While I remain doubtfulthat we are our ancestors’ wildest dreams, I believe we can be. More than fourhundred years since the symbolic birthdate of Black America, we still have theunique opportunity to shape our current dreams into future realities. The taskahead is not an easy one. But we can help chart out a path that leads us all toa better future—the kind of future that will more closely resemble ourancestors’ wildest dreams.” WholeheartedFaith ★★★★, by Rachel HeldEvans & Jeff Chu. Rachel Held Evans died before she could finish this book,so her family asked Jeff Chu to complete it. I had a lot of BIG feelings whilereading it. Rachel was such a good writer – and so relatable. One of hersignature phrases was “on the days when I believe” & that resonated so muchwith me. This book is about (duh) wholehearted faith – a faith that isn’t justpretending and isn’t just picking and choosing the parts we believe. If you’reinterested in a faith like that, you should definitely read this book. Gabriel’sAngel ★★★★, by Nora Roberts. I went way back toread this book – 1989! I don’t even know if I ever read it the first time. I’mrereading these because her Instagram account is posting flashback quotes fromold books & they catch my eye. This book is about an artist who is livingin a remote cabin when a very pregnant woman ends up trapped with him in asnowstorm. Shenanigans ensue. Even though it’s from so long ago it was still agood book with a strong lead female character.  Anxious People ★★★★★, by Fredrick Backman. When I firststarted listening to this book I thought I wasn’t going to make it for morethan a couple of chapters. It opens with police interviews and the people beinginterviewed were SO VERY ANNOYING I was going to give up. However, I perseveredand it was well worth it. This book is about a bank robbery gone terriblywrong. I love Backman’s books because they’re so full of grace. Eachrelationship is its own little jewel. I always have a very happy heavy sigh atthe end of his books.  I’ve finished four books so far in February. It’s possible (but not likely) that I’ll finish another one today. I’lltry very hard to post my February books before the end of March, but I’m notmaking any promises. Have you read anything interesting lately?"},

It’s sort of anIndian/Mexican fusion situation – fried egg on naan with guacamole & sourcream on top (as well as three kinds of cheese – Laughing Cow, shreddedMexican, and parm). It was GOOD ya’ll. I love how Dr. M always makessure that the flowers on his mother’s grave are fresh looking and seasonallyappropriate.

It’s been lighter for longer in the evenings so I was ok with it.  I also finished one of myWIPs that I “have” to finish before I can start on my new scarf (and a cardigan,and a secret blanket project that I haven’t talked about).

Afterdetermining that it wasn’t a problem with his hearing aid battery, Dr. Mscheduled an appointment with his audiologist.

So adorable. Meanwhile, Dr. M had awelcoming committee when he got home from his dad’s. And my tulips are openingup!

So I came up with an ideathat may or may not actually work. I’m a little nervous about it, but here goes! To honor Black History MonthI’m going to introduce you to accounts of some of the fabulous black women thatI follow. They’re creators, scientists, therapists, comedians, educators, andwomen who are just trying to live their lives and making me smile in theprocess. Some of them tell hard truths (most of them LIVE hard truths), but Ithink it’s important to listen. For day 1, I’m sharing mygorgeous niece who recently turned 20 years old (WHAT IN THE ACTUAL HECK) andwhose birthday card is sitting right beside me because that’s who I am as aperson. She’s an athlete who amazes me with her talent. She’s driven to do thebest she can, and her best is amazing.

Now I just have to arrange to meet up with the person who I’m givingit to.  I stayed up way too latelast night going through the materials for last Thursday’s anti racism class(oops). What was eerie is that the case study they discussed in one of thelectures was about Trayvon Martin, whose 27th birthday would havebeen yesterday. So since I was slack, I was hearing an analysis of his murdercase on his birthday. Cue Twilight Zone music. I also finished weaving in theends on this mini-shawl/scarf situation (it’s the shawl I was trying to makelast summer where I used the wrong weight of black yarn so it ended up beingtoo small. I didn’t frog it – figured I could find someone who would like it asa scarf.). Meet Lou Pruett here! Iwent to church today for the second Sunday in a row and I have to go again next week (I’m the lector). I’m in danger ofharkening back to my 8 days a week and twice on Sundays youth. Did you grow upas a churchy child? If not, what did you do on Sunday mornings?

I’ve always had to give myself little peptalks to get things done. And my favorite place to be is home, so I’ve alwayslow key resented social engagements. But I think it’s finally time for me toadmit that the last two years have taken their toll. I feel like I’m folding inon myself. Every task and every social interaction takes So Much Energy. TodayI went to church & cleaned the floors. That will probably be all that getsdone (except for laundry - weirdly I like doing laundry). And that tree willprobably stay up until the time changes. Despite what I wrote there,I did go through the two HUGE bins of Irish wool yarn that some fellow church membersin Ohio gave me years ago (I have a project in mind). This is just a samplingof what’s in there – and I found some mohair! I am a little intimidated bymohair – we’ll see if I ever do anything with it. Monday, January 10th   There’s another 10 yearchallenge going around on the socials (post a pic of yourself from 10 years ago& today).

You would think after nearly 2 years of wearing a mask with myglasses I would have it sorted, but no.  Friday, January 14th    My dad went to the hospitalon Thursday for a stress test which was apparently VERY stressful! Theyadmitted him, and once a room was finally available (he was in the ER foralmost 24 hours) they performed a cardioversion and sent him home. He felt alot better right after the procedure, but is now adjusting to all his new meds.Anyway, I took the first photo in the hospital because it made me laugh, andthen I took the second one once he got home as an apology to him for postingthe first photo.  Saturday, January 8th     This is a tale of woe and incompetence.My brother’s family was out of town & asked me to stop by to get their mailand to also make sure that their smaller dog (Holly) could figure out how toget back in the basement (she is not all that sure about the doggy door). Isuccessfully lured the larger dog (Chloe) back into the house, but Holly washaving NONE OF IT. So I had the bright idea to go through the house &unlock & open the basement door. Which worked GREAT. Except I forgot toclose the door at the top of the stairs & so both dogs raced up there andthere was nothing I could do to convince them to go back into the basement. TheCAT went into the basement (she came back up later). Then I tried to lure themback outside. Nope. The CAT went outside (I got her back in). So the end resultwas the two dogs sitting at the very top of the stairs staring down at me verysmugly. Sorry Joe and Bren. (P.S. there was some hilarity when I almost luredHolly out the door, but the cat came instead & I said “not you!” & thenHolly went running away. This happened about four times. Lort.) Meanwhile, Dr. M was gettingready for snowpocolypse!  We have around 3 – 4 inches of snow. I’m getting ready toeat some lunch and then I shall spend the rest of the day crocheting.

Does the sudden giant waterfallseem to happen daily, or is it more like a hundred year event? Do you notice mygyrations as I try to make sure I don’t wash you away? Someday I’ll need toclean the shower; will it be traumatic when I rehome you? HashtagThoughtsWhileBathing (Note: the spider was only about a quarter inch in size –eensy – and it was gone by the time I got home from work).  Thursday, December30thDr. M made an excellent soupfor dinner with orzo, spinach, & chicken – a contrast to all the cheesy things we’ve been eating.  Friday, December 31st    My rather orangy-yellowbrunch. Speaking of cheese, this thing had THREE kinds on it: a piece of naanwith laughing cow cheese spread on it, mounds of shredded cheese to make a nestfor my egg, and then parm on top. It was QUITE tasty. Saturday, January1st     It was my great-nephew’s 1stbirthday and I went to the party & took a zillion photos. I’m including allthe cake pictures because I find them hilarious. Maybe next week I’ll share thephotos I took of the other family members. Enjoy! We’re in a brand new year. I don’t feel all that optimisticabout it, but maybe I’ll be proved wrong. In the meantime I only have two “intentions”for the New Year: Do NOT buy more yarn unless absolutely necessary (I alreadyknow of one project where I will probably get some yarn). And work harder onpurchasing goods and services from people of color, where possible. Right nowboth of those feel equally doable and also difficult. We shall see! Do you haveany New Year’s Resolutions? Do tell!"},

It was a very nice day. Tomorrow isthe last Christmas gathering – with my college friends. I think this is the 37thyear?

I finished my temperature blanket this morning! The last daywas December 25th. It was actually supposed to be strawberry (it waswarm yesterday!), but I ran out of that color, so we ended the year with chartreuse.I’m thinking about doing a border, and was planning on using the three colorsthat I didn’t use this year (navy, purple, yellow), and I scoped out potentialborders in my 150 Border Book (<- not the actual name), but now that I’mlooking at them, and the finished blanket, I think they might be too busy.

Wesee how well that went. That means you’re getting more books than you mightwant to read about in this post. Sorry! Remember that I’m now doing a littlesummary (instead of copying & pasting the Goodreads description) & thatyou can click on the title for more detailed information.  TheLast Thing He Told Me ★★★★, by Laura Dave. Hannah and Owen have been married for one year when he inexplicablydisappears, leaving behind a cryptic note for Hannah to take care of his 16year old daughter Bailey. There are lots of twists and turnsand I did NOT agree with some of the actions that Hannah took, but oh mygoodness was this an excellent mystery! Also, I feel very trendy because it wonthe Goodreads award in the mystery genre this year.  DearWhite Peacemakers: Dismantling Racism with Grit and Grace★★★★★, by Osheta Moore.  Osheta Moore started writing “letters” to herwhite Instagram followers and decided to create this manual based on thoseletters. Her main focus is to remove the shame surrounding racism and helppeople to see that they can confront with kindness, and change hearts insteadof blaming them. At one point in the book she talks about how white people getconfused when she tells them to stop talking about how terrible they are and Icould really identify. It felt like she was being too easy on us. But you know –we can wallow in the shame of our lack of racial awareness, or we can buck upand get to work.  Concrete Rose(The Hate U Give #0.5) ★★★★★, by Angie Thomas. This is theprequel to The Hate U Give. In it wehear the story of Starr’s parents, told from the perspective of her father,Maverick. He becomes a single father while he’s in high school and the story isabout the way that he deals with that, with school, and with trying to earn aliving in the hood. Oh my goodness – it is sogood! I loved The Hate U Give soI knew I would probably like this book, but I didn’t realize that it was aprequel. When I figured that out I just ate it up with a spoon. I love Maverickand Lisa, and I think you would too.  The One ★★★★, by John Mars. A scientistdiscovered a way to use DNA to find a person’s perfect match. All you have todo is send in your swab to the company and you will find out who your person is(if they have also participated in the program). It’s not without controversy –marriages have broken up because of the results. This book follows five verydifferent couples as they get the results of their matches. The diversity ofthe stories kept me hooked, plus each one contains a little mystery, and one ofthem contains a HUGE surprise (to me anyway).  The Becoming(The Dragon Heart Legacy #2) ★★★★, by Nora Roberts. This is the secondnovel in this series. It is set in a parallel universe that is reached througha tree in Ireland. The main character, Breen, just found out that she hadmagical powers in the first book (and that she’s the key to saving all theworlds no biggie), and in this one she learns more about how to use thosepowers and gets to fight the big bad a little bit. This one was a lot of funbecause her best friend (who happens to be a black gay man) accidentally goesthrough the portal with her and some minor shenanigans ensue.  Troubled Blood(Cormoran Strike #5) ★★★★★, by Robert Galbraith. This is JK Rowling’sprivate investigator series written under the Galbraith pseudonym. I havereally enjoyed this series, but this particular one was excellent. In thisinstallment, Strike and his partner Robin take on a 40 year old cold case,about the disappearance of a young female doctor. I had many points in thestory where I just knew what had happened, but I in fact did not know. At all.I love it when a mystery book surprises me. Also, as usual with her writing,Rowling/Galbraith’s characters seem like real people with real strengths andfoibles and I want to be their friend.  I’vefinished one book so far in December, & will finish another one tomorrow. I’veonly read 47 books of the 60 book goal I set for myself. I did a LOT ofrereading of old favorites, and just in general didn’t read as much as Ithought I would. I think I won’t set a goal for next year because it has feltvery bossy to me. If I want to listen to podcasts instead of audiobooks Ishould be able to without guilt! What have you been reading that’s good? I’lladd it to my ever increasing list!"},

It was pretty rough calculating. I’m having trouble figuring outif I’m decreasing by one or two pixels each row. This might be why I’m not amath wizard.  I made another weird loaf ofbanana bread. We're still out of vanilla, so I used almond flavoring. I only had a half cup of sugar, so I added some brown sugar in.And I didn’t have enough banana, so I added an apple. And on a whim I threw insome mini chocolate chips. For some reason the apple & chocolate chips arekind of clashing to me. Does this mean I won’t eat it? No it does not. I justmeans that when I get a bite with both flavors I will make a little face.  You may nothave noticed that the title of this post is 2021 Project 365 – Week Fifty. Thatseems incorrect – there are three more weeks in the year after this one. Thereare two possible explanations: 1. I’ve gotten off track in my numbering (thisis my working theory), or it’s an anomaly because of the way the weeks arebroken up. And in fact, I just looked, and January 1 is on a Saturday, whichmeans that I will be calling the post with that day in it my first post of2022.  I AM NOT GOOD AT MATH.Additionally, I think I’m the only one who notices or cares.

Also, remember how I said that I was going to tryto change this up a bit? This is me trying to change it up. Instead of copyingand pasting the book description I’m going to just try to do a short summary(not my strong suit) & include a link in case you want to see a moredetailed description. Just click the book title to read the Goodreadsdescription. We’ll see how this goes.   AgathaRaisin and the Wizard of Evesham (Agatha Raisin#8) ★★★★,by MC Beaton. Agatha solves the mystery of the poisoning of a localhairdresser. Asyou may recall, I struggle with Agatha & her seemingly contradictorypersonality of bulldozer and caring what other people think. There was some ofthat in this book, but I enjoyed it more than some of the others. I know,glowing endorsement! But these are good books if you need something light andfluffy, with the added benefit of a good mystery. (It also helps to believethat Agatha is an Enneagram 3 – ha!) Snatched (WillTrent #5.5) ★★★★ & Criminal (WillTrent #6) ★★★★★, by KarinSlaughter.   In Snatched, aspunishment, Will has been assigned bathroom duty at the Atlanta airport –catching men soliciting other men. He becomes suspicious about a man who bringsa small girl into the bathroom & the rest of the short story is a mad chaseto identify the girl (who was kidnaped) & track her down. It left me alittle breathless, but it was very satisfactory. Criminal is the story of Will’s parents. His father, who is aserial killer who murdered his mother, is released from prison and starts uphis old habits. This story is about that, but is also an excellent look intothe life of a policewoman in the 1970s and the origin of Will’s boss Amanda& her coterie of “old gals.” I highly recommend it for that aspect of thestory alone.  Forgottenin Death (In Death #53) ★★★★★, by J.D. Robb. In this latest EveDallas book, she is solving the murder of a sidewalk sleeper as well solvingthe mystery of the bones of a pregnant woman, both found on a constructionsite in NYC. It’s an interesting look at old money, Russian mobs, and younglove. At this point in the series (#53! What the heck!), I just enjoy any opportunityto interact with old familiar characters.  TheMadness of Crowds (Chief Inspector Armand Gamache #17)★★★★★, by LouisePenny. Thisbook is set in a fictional time after the pandemic when everything is mostlyback to normal (wouldn’t that benice!). The main story revolves around a woman researcher who has made ashocking recommendation to ensure that the next pandemic isn’t so deadly. I won’tspoil the surprise by telling you what it is, but [insert mind blown &cursing emojis here]. This is another series where it feels like you arevisiting with old friends – and after the last one set in Paris, it’s nice tohave everyone “back home” in Three Pines.  Didyou notice that every book I read in September was part of a series? What can Isay? When I feel stressed I reach for familiar characters. Unless I go crazy onthis last day of October & finish another one, I’ve only read three books thismonth. One of them is technically a prequel, but the other two are stand-alonebooks (one is nonfiction). Hopefully it won’t take until the end of November todo a post about them! Now,tell me what good things you’ve read lately!"},

Hahaha! Tuesday, October 26th    This is NOT an attractivephoto, but this Amy’s Organic meal is DELICIOUS (Palak Paneer).  Wednesday, October27th    Iusually take my lunch hour in my office & it finally occurred to me tocreate a little nest so I’m more comfortable while I’m scrolling Instagram onmy iPad. (Note: being a hermit during lunch is what this introvert needs so shecan interact gracefully with employees the rest of the day.) Thursday, October 28th     Got my flu shot – this year’s bandage was Scooby &the Gang! Date night – TexMex & hockey.  Friday, October 29th   The 1970s was our team’s themethis year. I thought we did pretty well!  Saturday, October 30th   Weird food of the week –apple with peanut butter & pomegranate seeds. Yum! My (extremely talented)sister-in-law asked if I could help with her work’s trunk or treat. Her themewas Jurassic Park & my plan was to dress in khakis or something. But I don’town khakis & I did NOT want to go shopping. So I chose the T-Rex costume. Becauseat this point in my life I pretty much have no dignity left. But you know – it wasa hoot! I was a little claustrophobic to start off, but I got used to it. Thekids LOVED it. I actually tried to do some dancing with one of the kids, andsince I knew it looked hilarious I tried to do some running around. These first pictures are the view from inside the costume.    Because Iknow you have been on pins & needles, here is a baseball update: the Bravesare ONE WIN away from winning the World Series! If they win tonight they win itall & I can go back to getting an adequate amount of sleep. If they don’twin, they head to Houston for game 6 on Tuesday. This has been quite a ride,and I’m very proud of the team, but I am also ready for a baseball break. It’stime to hibernate for the winter & that involves going to bed in a timelymanner! What does self-care look like for you in these shorter days?"},

We didn’t score in the 6th,and the score is now 4-2 Braves. I am now to the point of chewing myfingernails off if I were the kind of person to chew my fingernails.

The majority of folks said that I should leave it long, and so did Dr. M. So my hair is safe…for now!  Thursday, October7th     I finally blocked the shawl I’ve been working on. Itwas a little bit like magic – when I finished the shawl it was a good bitbigger than the other version, but still not as big as the pattern said itshould be. But after I wet blocked it, it was almost exactly the right size. Iam very excited to do a photo shoot once it dries. Stay tuned! Friday, October 8th  Here is where I am thesedays – taking photos of things that are almost empty so I can remember to buythem.  Saturday, October 9th I made a banana & peanutbutter & mayo sandwich today & was a little optimistic about how much bananatwo slices of bread could handle. I took one bite, banana (and mayo &peanut butter) squished out everywhere, & I got a fork. What a (delicious)mess.  Tomorrow weare heading to the beach! I’m very excited.

{"title": "Book Reviews – the August Edition", "date": "Wednesday, September 22, 2021", "text": "I’vebeen putting off writing this post because I’ve made the process so complicatedfor myself. I think I’ll go ahead & do it the same way this month (andmaybe next), but I will hopefully change things up for the October book reviewpost. We shall see.  1. Terraform: Building a Better World, by Propaganda. ★★★★★ In this debut collection of essays and poetry, musician, speaker, andactivist Propaganda inspires us to create a better, more equitable world.  “If we get to make the very cultures that shape who we are, thenlet us remake them in the best way possible.” In this deep, challenging, and thoughtfulbook, Propaganda looks at the ways in which our world is broken. Using themetaphor of terraforming—creating a livable world out of an inhospitable one—heshows how we can begin to reshape our homes, friendships, communities, andpolitics.  The Bug Says: Istruggled with how to describe this & its impact on me. First of all, youneed to listen to it. It’s performance art, music, poetry, call to action… Hesays that if we have basically already created our cultures, why can’t weremake them into something better? Let’s terraform our world into what it couldhave been all along. I’ll be listening to this one again! 2. TheConsequences of Fear (Maisie Dobbs #16), by Jacqueline Winspear. ★★★★  September 1941: As Europe buckles under Nazioccupation, Maisie Dobbs investigates a possible murder that threatensdevastating repercussions for Britain's war efforts. While on a delivery, youngFreddie Hackett, a message runner for a government office, witnesses anargument that ends in murder. Crouching in the doorway of a bombed-out house,Freddie waits until the coast is clear. But when he arrives at the deliveryaddress, he’s shocked to come face to face with the killer. Dismissed by thepolice when he attempts to report the crime, Freddie goes in search of a womanhe once met when delivering a message: Maisie Dobbs. While Maisie believes theboy and wants to help, she must maintain extreme caution: she’s workingsecretly for the Special Operations Executive, assessing candidates for crucialwork with the French resistance. Her two worlds collide when she spots thekiller in a place she least expects. She soon realizes she’s been pulled intothe orbit of a man who has his own reasons to kill—reasons that go back to thelast war. The Bug Says: This seriesis so well written, and I love the audio narration. It’s like revisiting an oldfriend when I read the latest installment.  3. MagicalMidlife Madness (Leveling Up #1), by K.F.Breene. ★★★★ A womanstarting over. A new house with an unexpected twist. A cape wearing butleracting as the world's worst life coach. When Jessie’s husband of twenty years packs up and heads for greenerpastures and her son leaves for college, she decides it’s time for a do-over. Eagerfor a fresh start, she makes a somewhat unorthodox decision to move to a tinytown in the Sierra foothills. She’ll be taking care of a centuries old housethat called to her when she was a kid. It's just temporary, she tells herself.It'll just be for a while. That is, until she learns what the house really is,something she never could've imagined. Thankfully forty isn't too old to startan adventure, because that's exactly what she does. A very dangerous adventurethat will change her life forever. She has a chance to start again, and thistime, she makes the rules. The Bug Says: This was anexcellent light-hearted romp. Jessie’s character was refreshing because she’sforty, is done with doing what other people thinks she should, speaks her mind,and makes decisions about her own life – against a backdrop of a spooky house,vampires, werewolves, witches, and other interesting beings. It was a lot offun! Unfortunately the reviews for the next book in the series don’t look asgood, so I’m not sure if I’ll read it. If I do, you know you’ll hear about ithere! 4. Long Road to Mercy (Atlee Pine #1), by DavidBaldacci. ★★★ Atlee Pine, anFBI agent with special skills assigned to the remote wilds of the southwesternUnited States who must confront a new threat . . . and an old nightmare. Threedecades after her twin sister Mercy is kidnaped from their bedroom, Atlee Pineworks for the FBI. She's the lone agent assigned to the Shattered Rock, Arizonaresident agency, which is responsible for protecting the Grand Canyon. So whenone of the Grand Canyon's mules is found stabbed to death at the bottom of thecanyon-and its rider missing-Pine is called in to investigate. It soon seemsclear the lost tourist had something more clandestine than sightseeing in mind.But just as Pine begins to put together clues pointing to a terrifying plot,she's abruptly called off the case. If she disobeys direct orders by continuingto search for the missing man, it will mean the end of her career. But unlessPine keeps working the case and discovers the truth, it could spell the veryend of democracy in America as we know it... The Bug Says: The storywas excellent – I love the very strong lead character and that she had an equallystrong female sidekick. The three stars are for two reasons: 1. There were acouple of times when Atlee seemed reduced to the “little lady” when there was a“strong man” around (I might be a little too sensitive to this kind of thing,so maybe ignore this one). 2. I listened to the audiobook and as is so oftenthe case with Baldacci books, they had a female narrator and a male one. Thefemale narrator was EXCELLENT and thank goodness because she was the mainnarrator. But the male sounded like a porn star in a studio – the sound wastotally different (it was jarring!) and he sounded the exact same no matterwhich character he was being. Just terrible. This won’t stop me from listeningto the next one though.  I’vealready finished four books in September (although one was pretty much a short storyso it only sort of counts). I’ve started re-reading another Nora Robertsseries, so maybe the four will be all that get finished. We shall see. Now,tell me something good that you’ve read lately!"},

I love this one too – it was in the running for mynew office painting. I especially like it because it reminds me of vacationspast.  I stopped by to work apuzzle see Daddy & Sue after church. I brought KFC and we had a nicevisit.  I really struggle to read nonfiction books. There’s some sort ofmental block going on there. I have so many that I’ve bought recently &just allowed to languish, unread. So I’ve instituted a new policy (alsodesigned to get me to go to bed in a more timely manner): I’m reading a chaptereach evening right before I turn the light off. So far I’m really enjoying thisbook – although strangely I feel like she’s too nice to White Peacekeepers(which is the WHOLE POINT OF THE BOOK actually).  Monday, September 13th    SentDr. M this picture of my Cheeto stash at work.  Tuesday, September 14th        No photo.  Wednesday, September15th    I used to take sky pictures all the time in Ohio. Idon’t down here because there isn’t as much sky to photograph, but I’m going totry to remedy that because I need to remember it’s up there. Maybe SkyWednesday will become a thing!  Thursday, September16th    Dr. M posted a number of lovely pictures of rain-drenchedsedum and morning glories, but these were my favorites. Friday, September 17th   My dad’s birthday! I stoppedby to give him his gift (thesebooks),and watch him make a grape, peanut butter, and jelly sandwich. Topped with theheel of the bread. I posted it on the socials talking about how people would beable to see where I got my strange food choices from and everyone was all like,“that looks good!” And, “I would eat that!” Humph.  Saturday, September18th  We had a little family pizzaparty for the birthday boy. We were missing my brother who was out on the road,but it was a nice time with the ‘rents, Dr. M, my sister-in-law, and niece. DidI take photos of any of those people? No I did not. At least I got a picture ofthe pizza and my dad, so you know my priorities were in order.  Despite thefact that I continued to use red (and autumn red) in my temperature blanketlast week, there was definitely a hint of fall in the air. The mornings werecrisper, and I had to turn the light on in the living room as I was gettingready to leave for work each day. I was talking to Dr. M about how my dislikeof fall has softened over the years. I was feeling all philosophical (maybe Idon’t dread fall as much because he’s no longer teaching in the fall & I alwaysmissed Summer Dr. M…), but he was more practical: we live in the south now, so theonset of winter doesn’t depress me as much. (Yes, in my mind fall means that wewill immediately have winter – I am ever “A to Z” in all things.) How do youfeel about fall?"},

Igot new black(ish) yarn that is the correct weight & I think this one will endup being the right size. We shall see. I’ve said before that this is mylast attempt at this, and this is attempt #4 (I think?). So never say never?But also, never.  Yesterdaywas the 20th anniversary of 9/11 and I tried to stay off of socialmedia because I’m uncomfortable with so many of the types of remembrances wehave – and heaven forbid I be uncomfortable on the anniversary of a nationaltragedy. Maybe it’s the juxtaposition of this tragedy with the current one thathas (inexplicably) torn the country apart instead of bringing it together.

Also, I had thisto say about my fortune cookie fortune: What is it that I hold so closely thatI can’t give away? Well, the time I spend on my iPad comes to mind. I dojealously guard my “me time.” But the other thing I was thinking about is thestructures that are in place that make my life easier.

I finished the strap – just have to attach it& then crochet around the edges for a more finished look. And I might make a little matching bag for theinside. We shall see.  Iwas listening to a podcast today about humanizing politics (Sharon Says SoPodcast, episode 20 – an interview with the Pantsuit Politics podcast hosts)& one of the big takeaways for me was about preserving relationships withpeople that you disagree with. One of the hosts said that her line in the sandis to remember the humanity of all the people in the discussion. “Othering”people is so destructive – and both sides are very good at that. We can stillhold the people in power accountable, but we can still love and haverelationships with people who disagree with us. Sounds easy right? Ha! Yeah, I’llbe thinking about this concept for a while (not about my actual relatives &friends – it’s easy to love them even though we disagree – I’m thinking aboutFacebook & Instagram).

But also, I do like a heavy blanket, so there’s that. We were menaced by agoldfish! Monday, August 16th  Dr.M’s t-shirts have been getting more & more raggedy, so he’s been replacingthem with new ones (and his wife said glory hallelujah!). This week he gotshirts from some of his alma maters. This one is Western Carolina Universitywhere he got his master’s degree.  Tuesday, August 17th      Dr. M’s weather commandcenter – keeping an eye on Not Dead Fred. We got a LOT of rain and somethunderstorms from Fred, but were otherwise not inconvenienced.  Here’s Dr. M’s next almamater – University of Cincinnati where he got his Ph.D. You’ll have to waituntil next week to see the Wake Forest University one (undergrad degree).  Wednesday, August 18th    I decided to use my glasses as a headband. I don’tknow why they look better than an actual headband, but they do.  Thursday, August 19th The Braves weren’t playing, so Dr. M & I had apersonal space evening. I have no memory of what I did (Crochet? Instagram? Playeda game on my iPad? Listened to a podcast?), but he had a Star Trek marathon.  Friday, August 20th   No photo.  Saturday, August 21st    Temperature blanket update.I’m almost out of red and autumn red. This is the same problem I had with theorange temperature range in my last blanket. There are just long stretches ofhot right now.     Didyou notice that the world got much better and less crazy this past week? Meeither. Sometimes it feels like we’re circling the drain, but my own personallife is so comfortable that there’s a disconnect for me. I used to just notread the news so I didn’t have to worry about stuff. Now I obsessively checkthe news and feel helpless and depressed. How do you keep from living indespair?"},

I think that the photos we DID take will make up for that, but seriouslywe are getting slack. Sunday, August 8thNo photo.  Monday, August 9th  Dr.M’s shopping list. On Saturday when Dr. M was at his dad’s house he found ayellow jacket nest in the ground out by the muscadine vine. While he waspreparing the gasoline to pour on the nest, he disturbed a wasp nest & wasstung a dozen times on his legs. OUCH. Anyway, he took care of the yellow jackets& this list is making sure that he takes care of the wasps.  Tuesday, August 10th      I was hanging out at Daddy& Sue’s house when I found out that my great-nephew was over at my brother’shouse. It was nice to see you Daddy & Sue – bye!   Wednesday, August 11th    I WAS ABLE TO GIVE BLOOD! My iron was finally highenough. So I got to get my apple juice & oreos (the main reason I giveblood).  Thursday, August 12th This isn’t our photo, but it’s what we were doingtonight – watching the “Fieldof Dreams” game between the Yankees and the White Sox. It was pretty darnedspecial – Kevin Costner & then the players walking out of the corn onto thefield, and the bottom of the 9th walk off homer by the White Sox… I wasimpressed.  Friday, August 13th   Stopped by to see Daddy& Sue again. Daddy was showing me the recipe that he said reminded him ofsome of my concoctions. I think it looks amazing and I shall definitely betrying it. I mean, you can’t go wrong with naan can you? Saturday, August 14th  A final visit with the babybefore they head back to Oklahoma on Tuesday. We even facetimed his dad (whowas in training back at home). I’m just now realizing that I didn’t get a photoof his mom on this trip – sorry Britt!  He is SO CLOSE to crawling.But given how much he likes to bounce & keeps his legs so stiff, I think he’llbe walking in no time at all.  Temperature blanket update. Itlooks kind of pretty all laid out like that, but up close those warm weathercolor combos are U.G.L.Y. Also, I’m about to run out of red and harvest red.But we’re in the home stretch – I started my first decrease row this week.    Iwas glad to be able to give blood, although I felt kind of depleted (see what Idid there?) for a couple of days afterward. In fact I didn’t start feeling moreenergetic until today. So maybe I won’t try to give again right away when I’mallowed. But it’s hard because my blood type is desirable (O+) and there’s sucha shortage right now. And it’s one thing I can do when it feels like the worldis falling apart around me. I’m talking about world events, not my personalworld – although a cousin of Dr. M’s died after a bicycle accident this week.So sad. I guess I was giving blood for Chad. And the people in Myanmar, andAfghanistan, and Haiti… What do you do when the world is too much?"},

In the meantime, enjoythese lovely photos of Dr. M’s dad’s muscadine vines.  Ifelt really checked out (or more than usual) this past week.

{"title": "Book Reviews – the June/July Edition", "date": "Wednesday, August 4, 2021", "text": "Ionly read two books in June, but I read four in July, so buckle up!  1. Crooked River(Pendergast #19), by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child. ★★★★ Dozensof identical blue shoes are found in the ocean off the southwestern coast ofFlorida, all with a severed human foot inside, all exhibiting unmistakablesigns of violence. They appear out of nowhere one day, floating in on the tide.Called off the tarmac from his return flight back to New York City, Pendergastreluctantly arrives on Captiva Island and is quickly drawn into the mystery. Apreliminary pathology report indicates the feet were wrenched from their bodiesin the crudest of ways. As the days continue, more wash in until the numbertops one hundred. Soon, Pendergast and his partner, junior agent Coldmoon find themselvessquaring off against an adversary more powerful and deadly than they've everencountered.  The Bug Says: See thatdisgusted face up there? That was my reaction to one of the scenes from thisbook. Which is just par for the course for this series – I always try toremember to not eat anything while reading them. That said, I enjoyed it a lot –it was a return to Pendergast of old & I find him to be a fascinatingcharacter. And his ward Constance has a pretty interesting side plot too.  2. Fallen(Will Trent #5), by Karin Slaughter ★★★★ There’s no police training strongerthan a cop’s instinct. Faith Mitchell’s mother isn’t answering her phone. Herfront door is open. There’s a bloodstain above the knob. Everything Faithlearned in the academy goes out the window when she charges into her mother’shouse, gun drawn. She sees a man dead in the laundry room, a hostage situationin the bedroom. What she doesn’t see is her mother. When the hostage situationturns deadly, Faith is left with too many questions. She’ll need the help ofher partner, Will Trent, and trauma doctor Sara Linton to get some answers. ButFaith isn’t just a cop anymore, she’s a witness—and a suspect. To find hermother, Faith will have to cross the thin blue line and bring the truth tolight—or bury it forever. The Bug Says: I’m stillenjoying this series quite a bit. Lots of human drama, an excellent mystery,and the enigma that is Will Trent’s brain. Highly recommend! 3. Jesusand John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation,by Kristin Kobes Du Mez ★★★★★ A scholar of American Christianitypresents a seventy-five-year history of evangelicalism that identifies theforces that have turned Donald Trump into a hero of the Religious Right.How did a libertine who lacks even the most basic knowledge of the Christianfaith win 81 percent of the white evangelical vote in 2016? And why have whiteevangelicals become a presidential reprobate’s staunchest supporters? These areamong the questions acclaimed historian Kristin Kobes Du Mez asks in Jesus andJohn Wayne, which delves beyond facile headlines to explain how whiteevangelicals have brought us to our fractured political moment. Challenging thecommonly held assumption that the “moral majority” backed Donald Trump forpurely pragmatic reasons, Du Mez reveals that Donald Trump in fact representsthe fulfillment, rather than the betrayal, of white evangelicals’ most deeplyheld values. The Bug Says: Oh my goshthis book alternately blew my mind and blew my gasket. Such a good examination of evangelicalism and how it became what itis today. I feel like anything I say wouldn’t do justice to the book – if you’reinterested in this subject I recommend that you read it yourself. I’ll end witha quote from one of the reviews on Goodreads: “If you’re like me, you’ll end this book inlament and grief. These are not problems fixed with a clever tweet or a newdenomination or a label to replace evangelical. No easy fixes are offered. Iguess I’ll sit with the grief for a bit before I try to figure out where we gofrom here.” 4. While Justice Sleeps, by StaceyAbrams ★★★★★ AveryKeene, a brilliant young law clerk for the legendary Justice Howard Wynn, isdoing her best to hold her life together—excelling in an arduous job with thecourt while also dealing with a troubled family. When the shocking news breaksthat Justice Wynn—the cantankerous swing vote on many current high-profilecases—has slipped into a coma, Avery’s life turns upside down. She isimmediately notified that Justice Wynn has left instructions for her to serveas his legal guardian and power of attorney. Plunged into an explosive role shenever anticipated, Avery finds that Justice Wynn had been secretly researchingone of the most controversial cases before the court—a proposed merger betweenan American biotech company and an Indian genetics firm, which promises tounleash breathtaking results in the medical field. She also discovers that Wynnsuspected a dangerously related conspiracy that infiltrates the highest powercorridors of Washington. The Bug Says: I admitthat I got this book because of the novelty that Stacey Abrams wrote it – I wasVERY curious about how she would be as an author. I thought it was great – I likedthe main characters and the puzzle that they were trying to solve. And the endwas very satisfactory. I would definitely read another book by her.  5. Legacy, by Nora Roberts ★★★★★ Adrian Rizzo was seven when she mether father for the first time. That was the day he nearly killed her—before hermother, Lina, stepped in. A decade later, Adrian has created her own line ofyoga and workout videos, following in Lina’s footsteps but intent onmaintaining creative control. And she’s just as cool-headed and ambitious asher mother. They aren’t close, but they’re cordial—as long as neither crossesthe other. But while Lina dismisses the death threats that Adrian startsgetting as a routine part of her daughter’s growing celebrity, Adrian can’thelp but find the vicious rhymes unsettling. Year after year, they keeparriving—the postmarks changing, but the menacing tone the same. They continueafter she returns to Maryland and becomes reacquainted with Raylan, herchildhood crush, all grown up and as gorgeously green-eyed as ever. Sometimesit even seems like the terrifying messages are indeed routine, like nothingwill come of them. Until the murders start, and the escalation begins…  The Bug Says: Nora booksjust automatically get 5 stars, but this one was, as usual, excellent. I have aslight bias against fitness guru type people, so I had to get around that abit, but the story is good, and the mystery was compelling.   6. Project Hail Mary, by Andy Weir ★★★★ Ryland Grace is the sole survivoron a desperate, last-chance mission--and if he fails, humanity and the earthitself will perish. Except that right now, he doesn't know that. He can't evenremember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how tocomplete it. All he knows is that he's been asleep for a very, very long time.And he's just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, withnothing but two corpses for company. His crew mates dead, his memories fuzzilyreturning, he realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Alone on thistiny ship that's been cobbled together by every government and space agency onthe planet and hurled into the depths of space, it's up to him to conquer anextinction-level threat to our species. And thanks to an unexpected ally, hejust might have a chance. The Bug Says: I loved(LOVED) The Martian, but for somereason didn’t read Weir’s second book. But when my brother told me I had toread this one I decided to jump right on it. I didn’t love it to the level of The Martian, but it was pretty darnedclose (and actually, I will definitely read it again & probably love itmore with each reading). There is one character in particular that was just thebest.   Rightnow I’m reading Terraform: Building aBetter World by Propaganda and Ifeel like I need to insert that head exploding emoji to communicate how I feelabout it. I’m listening to the audio version, which he narrates, and since he’s aperformer it is just excellent. I hope I can find actual words to convey how Ifeel about it when I review it next month. How about you – has anything madeyour head explode (for good or ill) lately?"},

We’llsee if this works.   Monday, July 19th Nopicture (but don’t get excited – there are two pictures for each other day –ha!). Tuesday, July 20th    Ms. Pinky Two Tone and Ms.Rita Vermillion are having a fine summer.  I posted this on Instagram: Dayoff from work. Cut my fingers while slicing mango & I think I have cream ofchicken soup in my hair. How’s your day going? Wednesday, July 21st   Yet another post from Instagram: Colonoscopyprep day here. Fun! (Note: no drama queens live in this house. Well, 2. Thereare 2 drama queens in this house.) Morning Glories! Thursday, July 22ndProcedure day! Dr. M couldn’t come into the facility with me, so hewent to Sonic and then chilled in the parking lot. They had some lovely CrapeMyrtles.  This is my makeup free relieved face. Whew! Friday, July 23rd  Dr. M saw this red fox athis dad’s house. It was mostly interested in the cat food.  A friend sent me this bookand a gorgeous card that she had painted (she’s so talented). She thought Iwould enjoy the writings of this lady. Can’t wait to dive in! Saturday, July 24th Dr. M says: Themiracle of the Catalpa (aka Catawba) tree: catalpa sphinx moth caterpillars canstrip it bare of leaves, as they did this one, but the tree survives. Also,bonus goat! Temperature blanket update,plus a bonus behind the scenes picture! So glad Dr. M got this step ladder forme – it makes taking these pictures so much easier. Maybe next week I’ll havehim take a picture of me ON the ladder.   Dr. M’s dadhas an infected toe, and since he’s an 89 year old diabetic that is notsomething that we take lightly. As a result, Dr. M has spent more time than usualat his dad’s house, in addition to worrying about & taking care of me (aweek without my pain meds, plus feeling weak from no food made me extrapitiful). And right now he’s out there mowing our grass while I lounge aroundediting photos. So basically this is a Dr. M appreciation paragraph – he is theBEST.

And chickens. Slow down for chickens.). (After Iposted this on Facebook one of my friends created the photo on the left whichof course I loved so it’s my new profile picture.) The Roy stopped by for atreat.

I ordered a different black yarn and I willfrog this and start over – with a larger hook. We shall see! I consoled myself with agarlic toast & lasagna sandwich – yum! Wednesday, July 14th   Dr. M drove by this field of sunflowers today. It’s adifficult anniversary for us (really a hard week altogether – see tomorrow) becauseit was on this day 5 years ago that Dr. M received the news that he’d lost hisjob.

Sad. (P.S. a friend pointed out that it would probably be a good idea for me to look into that driving skills course - it might help me with my parking.)  Friday, July 16th  Back on the 4th when I woremy patriotic jewelry I felt conflicted & sad that it didn’t represent allthat I feel about our country. So I decided to at least do this small thing. Ihad seen these bracelets by Mudlove wornby someone I follow on Instagram & loved them. And the bracelet is evenbetter in person! Also, the purchase of a bracelet provides one week of cleanwater for someone in need. So get one for yourself! You can personalize it tosay what you want.

I mostly like it,but there is one issue: it’s about 2/3 the size it’s supposed to be. The blackyarn I used was “light fingering” instead of regular fingering. I didn’t thinkit would make that big a difference, but apparently it does. It is SO TEMPTINGto get the correct weight yarn & rip all this back out & redo it. I’llthink about it. What I’ll probably do instead is just live with this size andmake another one with completely different colors. We shall see. If you have anopinion, let me know.  So thismorning I was fixing my breakfast, and had finished spreading Laughing Cowcheese on my toast, went & got a fork, and then looked down and saw two caseknives in my hand.So that’s how things are going for me.

They have beenso much fun this year.  Wednesday, June 23rd  Had to stay late at work because I was hosting awebinar for employees who are close to retirement (by “hosting” I mean I turnedthe computer on & clicked on the link for the webinar – but I also tooknotes to email the attendees).  Thursday, June 24thDr. M decided that he needed to contain the wildflowerbed – it was getting difficult to mow around it with the stalks all willynillyon the grass. Note: the bee balm is taller than I am! (But yes, I am short – 5’4”) I have three of these shower caps (because YAY I don’twash my hair every day). This is a picture of the third one in two weeks tofall into the toilet. I throw them in the laundry & wash them, but I hadn’t even had a chance yet to washthe other two. Maybe I need to find another place to store them?  The Strawberry Moon! Friday, June 25thFrom Dr. M’s Facebook page: Thereis a disconnect between things and joy. Yes, air conditioning is a thing Ienjoy, and I feel bad for our landlords that ours was not really fixed duringthe first service call, but there is a terrific trade off: I might be insideright now, cursing the television, er, I mean watching baseball. Instead I amlistening to birds sing their evensongs. My absolute favorite is that of theshy wood thrush. Comfort can be bought; joy is priceless                                (The Bug’s Note: theair conditioner guy came out on Tuesday, flipped the switch, & it worked. Hedidn’t try to investigate why it hadn’t been working – did he just think wewere idiots & didn’t know how it worked? Then on Thursday it stoppedworking again. So he gets to come back on Monday.) Saturday, June 26thLots of pictures today (andmaybe a video if I can get it uploaded). First off, our wildflower bed (again, I know). Here is where the videowill go. If it’s not there you will know that I failed. Just know that it showsall the bumblebees gorging on our bee balm.  Weekly temperature blanketupdate.  We took a road trip up toRoan Mountain in Tennessee. I’m going to do a separate post, but in themeantime, here is us at lunch. The BBQ was so-so, but the hush puppies werefirst rate! Date night on the deckbecause it was much cooler outside than inside. We did have a third wheel for alittle while (his mom was mowing so he ran away from home).  This is the second weekendin a row that I haven’t been able to do any housework. Well, you know I’m usingthe heat as an excuse because if I got up early enough I could do some stuff. But why would I do that whenI have this perfectly good excuse not to? Instead, I am heading to my dad’shouse here in a little while to work on the wolf puzzle. I know I’ll beinterfering with their Sunday afternoon naps, so I told them to just go ahead& ignore the maniac at the puzzle table. What are you going to do with yourSunday afternoon?"},

But,reader, apparently I did not. I probably am remembering something from threeweeks ago. That’s just how it is these days. But as you can see, I didn’t needanother picture for this post and you will probably be glad that I never foundit. Sunday, June 13thWe took a ramble today! Wedrove up to Craggy Gardens on the Blue Ridge Parkway & it was just lovely!We ate sub sandwiches in the car, and saw rhododendrons, mountain laurel, and azaleas… Monday, June 14th   Dr.M’s salad. I’d kind of like to be eating it right now! Tuesday, June 15th    Flowers at Dr. M’s dad’shouse. Wednesday, June 16th The bee balm is blooming!  Meanwhile, it finally happened. My boss & I knewthat we owned the same outfit, but so far we’d managed to not wear it on thesame day. Note: I’ve always thought we were the same height. I am much shorterthan I think I am. Ha! Stopped by to work on thepuzzle. It’s coming along.  Thursday, June 17thWe have a couple of hanging baskets that we just leavealone every year & they always seem to come back. So pretty! They also havelots of other things in there (like sorghum – ha!) – it makes them moreinteresting. Also, Ms. Pinky is outrageous.  Friday, June 18thI walked in the kitchen& saw this – made me laugh! I had boiled a couple of eggs earlier in the week& then accidentally packed both of them for my lunch. Dr. M was making surethat this time I left his alone! Our air conditioner stoppedworking on Thursday. This was the temp in the bedroom at 7:00 p.m. We’ve beenleaving the windows open & running fans at night, which has helped some,but it feels like we’re back in the olden days. Ha! We’ll survive, but pleaseknow that we will whine about it. They’re coming out on Tuesday to see what’sgoing on.  Saturday, June 19thTemperature blanket update!I had to frog about 5 days because I figured out I was doing the “rectangle”bit incorrectly. I’m glad I figured it out when I did because we had ten straight days of red! That made itpretty easy to rip it out & do it the right way.  You haven’t seen a weirdfood update in a while. I made myself a “banana split” using Greek yogurt intowhich I’d mixed some butterscotch pudding mix and another batch with chocolatefudge pudding mix, with cool whip on top. This is a WW trick – it’s lower “points”but do not be fooled into thinking it tastes like ice cream. Or pudding. Ittakes care of my sweet tooth though, so I guess that’s something. And thenlater I had French toast for dinner. I did NOT eat that whole stack. I wantedto, but my body said nope. I had the rest for breakfast.  Yesterday was Juneteenth.Dr. M posted this on Facebook, which I thought was way more eloquent than Iwas! “For historians of slavery and emancipation, Juneteenth is but one of manyemancipation days. I confess that it wasn’t even on my radar for years, as ithad no association with emancipation in North Carolina or Kentucky. But overmany decades, that day came to symbolize emancipation itself in the minds offormer slaves and their descendants, and so it is altogether fitting that wecelebrate it as a nation. The Emancipation Proclamation, after all, did notliterally free slaves. Rather, it made emancipation the penalty imposed onslave holders who continued to rebel against the United States government. Defacto freedom came about slowly, as was the case for slaves in East Texas, andeven then it was freedom with many restrictions. Still, slavery’s demise in ournation, written into our Constitution via the 13th Amendment, was a major stepin a more just, more equal direction. Celebrating Juneteenth is a way ofhonoring the enslaved and their centuries of travail and loss. It is a way ofcommemorating the long struggle for freedom and all who acted, with words andarms and feet, to make it a reality, individually and collectively. And it is away of refocusing our nation on how far we have come and how much farther wehave to go to guarantee liberty and justice for all.”"},

I am perhaps not the most discerning of readers…    1. Fractured (Will Trent #4), by KarinSlaughter. ★★★★ When SpecialAgent Will Trent arrives in Grant County, he finds a police departmentdetermined to protect its own and far too many unanswered questions about aprisoner's death. He doesn't understand why Officer Lena Adams is hidingsecrets from him. He doesn't understand her role in the death of Grant County'spopular police chief. He doesn't understand why that man's widow, Dr. SaraLinton, needs him now more than ever to help her crack this case. Whilethe police force investigates the murder of a young woman pulled from a frigidlake, Trent investigates the police force, putting pressure on Adams just whenshe's already about to crack. Caught between two complicated and determinedwomen, trying to understand Linton's passionate distrust of Adams, the factssurrounding Chief Tolliver's death, and the complexities of this insular town,Trent will unleash a case filled with explosive secrets--and encounter a thinblue line that could be murderous if crossed. The Bug Says: It feels weird to think back to this book because I’mgoing to finish book 5 today. I obviously like this series! One of the things Ilike and that also aggravates me is that all the people in the book are real –no caricatures here. They have real strengths and weaknesses and weird foibles.I get mad at them & root for them. I’m getting a little bit invested inthese characters! 2. The Ministry of Ordinary Places: Waking Upto God's Goodness Around You, by ShannanMartin. ★★★★ ForChrist-followers living in an increasingly complicated world, it can be easy tofeel overwhelmed and unsure of how to live a life of intention and meaning.Where do we even begin? Shannan Martin offers a surprisingly simple answer:uncover the hidden corners of our cities and neighborhoods and invest deeply inthe lives of people around us. She walks us through her own discoveries aboutthe vital importance of paying attention, as well as the hard but rewardingtruth about showing up and committing for the long haul, despite the inevitableencounters with brokenness and uncertainty. With transparency, humor,heart-tugging storytelling, and more than a little personal confession, Martinshows us that no matter where we live or how much we have, as we learn what itis to be with people as Jesus was, we'll find our very lives. The details willlook quiet and ordinary, and the call will both exhaust and exhilarate us. Butit will be the most worth-it adventure we will ever take. The Bug Says: This is the second of Shannon’s books that I’ve read.I follow her on Instagram and I like her a lot. And I love the lesson in thisbook – being a good neighbor (literally) is what the Gospel is all about. There’sno need to plant yourself somewhere exotic and show God’s love to the people there – there arepeople right next door who could use that love. 3. The Minor Adjustment Beauty Salon (No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency #14), by Alexander McCall Smith ★★★★ Modernideas get tangled up with traditional ones in the latest intriguinginstallment in the beloved, best-selling No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency series.Precious Ramotswe has taken on two puzzling cases. First she is approached bythe lawyer Mma Sheba, who is the executor of a deceased farmer’s estate. MmaSheba has a feeling that the young man who has stepped forward may be falselyimpersonating the farmer’s nephew in order to claim his inheritance. MmaRamotswe agrees to visit the farm and find out what she can about theself-professed nephew. Then the proprietor of the Minor Adjustment Beauty Saloncomes to Mma Ramotswe for advice. The opening of her new salon has beenshadowed by misfortune. Not only has she received a bad omen in the mail, butrumors are swirling that the salon is using dangerous products that burnpeople’s skin. Could someone be trying to put the salon out of business? Meanwhile,at the office, Mma Ramotswe has noticed something different about Grace Makutsilately. Though Mma Makutsi has mentioned nothing, it has become clear that sheis pregnant . . . But in Botswana—a land where family has always been heldabove all else—this may be cause for controversy as well as celebration.The Bug Says: This might bemy favorite book in this series. It’s a love song to Africa, to Botswana, andeven to Mma Makutsi! I was just about to give up on this series because she hasbeen driving me crazy, but this book redeemed her (or at least made me feelmore kindly). Oh, and this is the book I was listening to when I made that “daw”face – it was a very sweet moment with one of the more irascible characters inthe book.   4. The Whispering Room (Jane Hawk #2), by DeanKoontz ★★★★ Inthe wake of her husband’s inexplicable suicide—and the equally mysteriousdeaths of scores of other exemplary individuals—Jane picks up the trail of asecret cabal of powerful players who think themselves above the law and beyondpunishment. But the ruthless people bent on hijacking America’s future fortheir own monstrous ends never banked on a highly trained FBI agent willing togo rogue—and become the nation’s most wanted fugitive—in order to derail theirinsidious plans to gain absolute power with a terrifying technologicalbreakthrough. Driven by love for her lost husband and by fear for thefive-year-old son she has sent into hiding, Jane Hawk has become an unstoppablepredator. Those she is hunting will have nowhere to run when her shadow fallsacross them.The Bug Says: This book was sometimesso intense that I found myself holding my breath. At the same time it wasvery measured with the drama building and exploding and building and exploding…It was exhausting! It is written in Dean Koontz’s usual style, which may or maynot suit you. The only thing missing is a dog.  I’ve finished one book so far in June (the one where I posted the picture of mydisgusted face), and I’ll finish another one today. And I just started amystery written by Stacy Abrams! What have you been reading?"},

Part of our homework wasto update our social medial profiles. I had actually done mine earlier that daybecause I was going through the workbook.  Tuesday, June 8th    Coneflowers! Wednesday, June 9th Daddy & Sue were out of town (they’re back now),but that didn’t stop me from going by their house & working on the newpuzzle during my lunch hour. I was late getting back to work! Thursday, June 10thGloriosa DOUBLES! I didn’t even know that was a thing.So pretty! Friday, June 11thThis is what I posted onInstagram & Facebook: I’ve never done a “Friday Introduction” before, butit’s part of my anti-racism homework, so here we are. Hi! My name is Dana andI’m a middle-aged white woman who is a left leaning liberal Christian. I thinkeveryone is welcome to God’s table & if they can’t get in the door or walkup to the table or can’t have alcohol or gluten - well we make the table wherethey are with the elements they can partake of. Also, “everyone” means she, he,they, them, straight, queer, bi, ace… Sorry - I got off on a tangent. What I meant to say is thatwhile I still want to make sure everyone is welcome, I have a new growth edgein my life: learning about how I benefit from white supremacy & what I cando about dismantling it. It’s probably going to make me uncomfortable. And I’mprobably going to drive my friends & family (& you!) crazy. Are youready? Saturday, June 12thI haven’t enjoyed ourwildflower bed one bit. Nosiree! Next week I’ll take a picture of the fulleffect because although we have some gorgeous blooms, the vast majority of itis taking its own sweet time (bee balm, I’m looking at you!).  Since Daddy & Sue wereback I decided to go work the puzzle visit them.  No temperature blanketupdate – it was rainy so I couldn’t do a good photo shoot. Just imagine lastweek’s photo with a row of red because that’s all we’ve had all week! Worked onmy shawl a bit. I’ve already frogged it (again) because I didn’t like my colorplacement. I’m still not totally sold, but at this point I’m just going to moveforward and see what happens because frankly, it looks totally different after each new row. Dr. M and I are taking alittle road trip to the mountains tomorrow. It’s been forever since we’ve had aramble! I’m looking forward to feeling a wee bit like we’re on vacation. Whattrips do you have planned this summer?"},

{"title": "Book Reviews – the April Edition", "date": "Wednesday, May 26, 2021", "text": "Here we are almostfinished with May, and I’m just now writing my April book review post. I readfive books in April.     1. A Rhythm of Prayer: A Collection ofMeditations for Renewal, edited by Sarah Bessey. ★★★★★ It's no secret that we are overworked, overpressured, andedging burnout. Unsurprisingly, this fact is as old as time--and that's why wesee so many prayer circles within a multitude of church traditions. Thesegatherings are a trusted space where people seek help, hope, and peace,energized by God and one another.This book, curated by acclaimed author SarahBessey, celebrates and honors that prayerful tradition in a literary form. Acompanion for daily inspiration, this collection gives women permission torecognize the weight of all they carry, while also offering a broadenedimagination of hope--of what can be restored and made new. Each prayer is anoriginal piece of writing, with a short introduction from Bessey sharingexactly why she loves and looks up to the writer.This book is a literary hug, an invitation forrespite, and a chance for readers to pause and celebrate who they are, beyondwhat they do. The Bug Says: This book caused QUITE a furor because of a prayerwritten by Dr. Chanequa Walker-Barnes, which contains these words: “DearGod, Please help me to hate White people. Or at least to want to hate them. Atleast, I want to stop caring about them…” (You can read the full text here.) As a progressive white Christian lady, when I read that prayerI thought, “PREACH!” But there was some conservative outrage about thiswell-educated black woman who wanted to hate white people. It is a beautifulprayer, written in the style of lament, as a response to a \"friend\" using racist language, and she should not have been harassed becauseof it. Harrumph. Also, the other prayers were lovely too. If you’re a person offaith, or almost faith, or used to be, or just curious, I highly recommend thisbook! 2. Fractured (Will Trent #3), by KarinSlaughter. ★★★★ When a tortured young woman enters the traumacenter of an Atlanta hospital, Dr. Sara Linton is thrust into a desperatepolice investigation with Special Agent Will Trent and his partner, FaithMitchell. Though guarding their own wounds and their own secrets, Sara, Will,and Faith find that they are all that stand between a madman and his nextvictim. The Bug Says: I am reallyenjoying this series. Lots of moving parts, excellent twists that I don’t seecoming, engaging characters… I’ve already finished book #4 and enjoyed it justas much. 3. Twisted Twenty-Six (Stephanie Plum #26), by JanetEvanovich. ★★★★ Grandma Mazur is a widow...again. This time hermarriage lasted a whole 45 minutes. The unlucky groom was one Jimmy Rosolli, local gangster,lothario (senior division) and heart attack waiting to happen...well, thewaiting's over. It's a sad day, but if she can't have Jimmy at leastGrandma can have all the attention she wants as the dutiful widow. But somekinds of attention are not welcomed, particularly when Jimmy's former\"business partners\" are convinced that his widow is keeping the keysto their financial success for herself. As someone who has spent anentire career finding bad guys, a set of missing keys should be no challengefor Stephanie Plum. Problem is, the facts are as twisted as a boardwalk pretzelwith mustard.The Bug Says: While I was reading this book I kept thinking, didsomeone else write this? Grandma Mazur waxed philosophical, Ranger ate ice cream (!!!), and Stephanie seemed tobe a much more deep thinker. I didn’t dislike the change, but I definitelynoticed it. I went to check out the comments on Goodreads & lots of other folksnoticed too. It will be interesting to see what the next one is like. 4. Next toLast Stand (Walt Longmire #16), by Craig Johnson. ★★★★ One of the most viewed paintings in American history,Custer's Last Fight, copied and distributed by Anheuser-Busch at a rate of overtwo million copies a year, was destroyed in a fire at the 7th CavalryHeadquarters in Fort Bliss, Texas, in 1946. Or was it? When Charley LeeStillwater dies of an apparent heart attack at the Wyoming Home for Soldiers& Sailors, Walt Longmire is called in to try and make sense of a piece of apainting and a Florsheim shoebox containing a million dollars, sending the goodsheriff on the trail of a dangerous art heist. The Bug Says: What I love most about these books is that Walt is “stillwaters run deep” personified. He spends a lot of time in his head, but there isstill plenty of action. And a bonus in this one was hearing the Native Americanview of Custer.5. Midnight at theBlackbird Café, by Heather Webber. ★★★★ Nestled inthe mountain shadows of Alabama lies the little town of Wicklow. It is herethat Anna Kate has returned to bury her beloved Granny Zee, owner of theBlackbird Café. It was supposed to be a quick trip to close the café andsettle her grandmother’s estate, but despite her best intentions to avoidforming ties or even getting to know her father’s side of the family, Anna Katefinds herself inexplicably drawn to the quirky Southern town her mother ranaway from so many years ago, and the mysterious blackbird pie everybody can’tstop talking about. As the truth about her past slowly becomes clear,Anna Kate will need to decide if this lone blackbird will finally be able totake her broken wings and fly.The Bug Says: This book is almost too syrupy sweet, but I loved it. Maybe I needed something lightafter all the murder & mayhem. There is depth to it as well. It was very satisfactoryto read!  I’ve only finished two books so far in May. I’d better get with it, or nextmonth’s reviews will be slim pickins! What good things have you read lately?"},

Some IDs are easy: the lance-shaped leaves that give uslovely yellow coreopsis, which blooms not too long after we spy orange Siberianwallflowers. Harder is remembering the difference between anise hyssop leaves(broader, duller arrowhead leaves, shorter plants) and bee balm leaves(narrower, sharper leaves, taller plants focused on world domination).

I went in there to see what all theracket was about & found him huddling by the bin on the floor and he wasADORABLE. I should have taken a picture. P.P.S. I just realized this happenedon Monday, but this is the day without a photo so the story is staying here.Thursday, May 13th    I was unstapling my gazillionth open enrollment packet& wondered how long after the invention of the stapler did someone decideto invent the staple remover. Seventyyears! That’s crazypants. (Although I have not fact checked this historynugget, so take it with a grain of salt).  Dr. M helped mow his dad’s yard, except this ditch. Heliked the look of the wildflowers.  Friday, May 14th   Our peonies finally decided to bloom – so gorgeous!Plus Peaches the knockout rose is going gangbusters.  Photos from the baseballevent. Yes, I took my knitting. Ha! And speaking of mysister-in-law, my nephew graduated summacum laude with his associate degree in mechatronics. So proud! He’s headingonto Old Dominion for his next degree.  Saturday, May 15th   After I finally woke upyesterday I sat on the deck and crocheted for a while with the bolting basil and prehistoric looking geraniums. My temperature blanketis now resembling Wild Berry Skittles.  Later on we had a visit fromRoy!  Well, the CDC and ourgovernor have now told us that we can be mask free except in certaincircumstances. So I’ve done a few maskless things, but it FEELS VERY WEIRD. I’mgoing to be playing this by ear. Will definitely still wear a mask when I gointo a store. How are things where you are – are you going to stop wearingmasks?"},

This picture isn’t the best – it’s actuallymore rectangular than it appears here.  Tuesday, May 4th  This is what I saw when Ileft the office to walk to my car. I had to basically walk around the wholeblock to get to my car – in the rain. I was not amused! Wednesday, May 5th      The Dr. Van Fleet rose atDr. M’s dad’s house – it’s always so faithful to bloom around Mother’s Day. It’sa cutting from Dr. M’s grandmother’s rose.  Thursday, May 6th    I had a headache, which is a rare enough occurrence thesedays that I decided to be a drama queen about it. I found myself sitting at mydesk with my hand pressed to my forehead & had to document it.  Seen around the house – it’s so pretty here right now! Friday, May 7th   I finished my second dishcloth!I ended up purling a few rows on this one, but I actually like the texture ofjust knitting the whole thing. I also started on my next project, using scrubbyyarn. I’m not addicted to knitting. Nope. Not me. That evening I went to aparty celebrating my cousin’s daughter – K graduated from PA school! We’re veryproud of her – she’s worked hard. She takes her boards next week (I think) andthen she’ll be ready to find a job as a physician’s assistant.  Saturday, May 8th   Weekly temperature blanketsighting. I went outside to do the photo shoot, but suddenly there was FreeRange Roy & I decided that Roy and crochet do NOT mix. I gave him sometreats & came back inside.  Wrapped a couple of morepresents. Then smooshed them into an envelope for mailing – at least theylooked cute for a few minutes. Well, I’m still half asleep,but I’ve reached the end of this post. I could wait until tomorrow to look itover and make sure I’ve made sense, but why would I do that? So I shall publishthis and then sleep like a baby that actually sleeps through the night.

I listened to it this Sunday too.  I washed The Monster (my2016 temperature blanket for those who might not remember) & prior tofolding it to put away for the summer I decided to “try it on.” Man that thingis huge! Monday, April 26th  Mycurrent temperature blanket is starting to look like an explosion of My Little Ponies. Tuesday, April 27th  Cardinals always look soANNOYED! I love the photo that Dr. M got of Papa in flight.  Wednesday, April 28th      Look ma – I’m knitting! Thisis a dishcloth, which is the perfect full circle thing for me to knit. Thewhole reason I started crochet was that the person who used togive us knitted dishcloths left the family (she was a girlfriend) so I decidedto give it a shot but I was intimidated by knitting needles & had crochetedlong ago. Will I start handing out knitted dishcloths on some distantChristmas? We shall see! Our azaleas, showing off.  Thursday, April 29th    Well, the My Little Pony phase didn’t last long –today I messed that whole vibe up with the introduction of RED.  Friday, April 30th   Phoebe babies!! Dr. M got his second jabtoday. So so grateful.  It’s Ms. Rita the Vermilliongeranium’s gotcha day! I got her at a church conference five years ago. She’sstill waking up from her winter slumber and giving off a serious bonsai tree vibe.   Saturday, May 1st   It’s May! It was GORGOUS andI spent a great deal of time crocheting and knitting on the deck. And I have awee bit of sunburn to show for it (plus a finished crochet project – photo shootafter it dries). Anyway, here is my temperature blanket through April. It’sinteresting seeing the gradual change from the cool weather colors to thewarmer ones. Just wait until we get to orangeand yellow! We had a council meetingafter church today – the first “real” one since last February (we’ve beenzooming, but it’s not really the same). We even talked about starting the choirback (the CDC says that we can if we’re vaccinated – our choir is usually only8 or 9 people). Things are starting to feel a little more normal. Yay! Butreally we’re only as safe as the rest of the world is, so I hope that India isable to come out of its crisis SOON. How are things where you are? Feeling alittle closer to normal? Or are you a “nope not ready yet” person (this iswhere I fall, but I guess I don’t have any say in the matter)."},

This is similar tohow I often have to leave the room during movies.  Monday, April 19th  Nophoto – just this screenshot. Tuesday, April 20th  First time eating in arestaurant in over a year and I got a burrito as big as my head! I only atehalf. It was REALLY good! Wednesday, April 21st      Freeze warning, so Mandy theMandevilla & Sir Basil, Duke of Pesto came inside for a couple of nights.  Thursday, April 22nd   This is apparently a problem with these Fitbit bands.This is the second one that has come loose like this. I took it to a jeweler,but since this is considered “fast fashion” it’s not something they handle. Soin addition to knitting I shall now start trying to figure out jewelry making.Fun! Friday, April 23rd  Dr. M got a new Hurricane’st-shirt. This thing is huge! I should do a photo shoot – I could wear it withleggings & be very fashionable. Or maybe not. Saturday, April 24th  Dr. M looked out the window& saw a flash of blue. We’ve been getting blue jays & bluebirds, butthis time it was an Indigo Blue Bunting! They come through around this time everyyear.  I was watching my BicraftyBootcamp video where the instructor was teaching me how to knit, but I wasbehind on my temperature blanket so I crocheted that while I was watching. That’sbicrafty, right?  Weekly blanket update –indoors because it was pouring rain all day. Things definitely took a cold turnat the end of the week – brrr! Today has been gorgeous – a nicebreak after the cold and the rain.

Why do you ask? Dr.M found us a couple of new flowers for the front, and took some photos of howpretty everything is.  I’vedecided to become bicrafty & ordered some knitting needles. But I had these(size 11 for folks who know) and thought I’d get a head start. Um.

I’m appalled at violence against Black folks and Asian folksand transgender folks. And this violence is NOT NEW. I helped my historianhusband research “outrages” against freed people in post Civil War Kentucky. Idream of a world where a traffic stop doesn’t have to be deadly. Or where aperson who doesn’t look like me can just walk home safely. Or where people canbe the people that they want to be, love who they want to love, and have thesame rights as everyone else. I also dream of a day when I can actually knit.Things are not looking good. (Thanks to @deidrariggs for encouraging me towrite this out.)  Friday, April 16th  Mammogram selfie, and a bookfrom waiting area. I had a bit of a scare because they took me back for anultrasound after reviewing my first set of images. Fortunately it was justanother cyst – and I don’t have to go back again for another year. Woot!  Oh my goodness – such excellentnews! The prayer shawl made it to its recipient! It had NOT been delivered –apparently it just went on a long journey (or fell into a crevice in the mailtruck). This was such a lovely surprise during a hard news week.  Saturday, April 17th  A ridiculous number ofphotos today. First up, my temperature blanket photo shoot has moved outdoors(that’s a pink sheet in case you’re concerned about your eyes). I had the bonusof getting to see this cutie while I was out there.   Our neighbor’s azaleas –also gorgeous. They’re practically neon. I finally took my hair downfrom the top knot I wore to bed the night before. My hair is ridiculous –although as I told someone, all that volume is 50% dry shampoo (I haven’twashed my hair since Tuesday).  I went out to the swing toread my book (the latest Walt Longmire) and ended up with a very furry visitor.He makes me laugh. He was a very good boy, so we walked up to the house so Dr.M could give him a treat. I feel like we’ve enteredthe season of Too Many Pictures.

No I will not.  Sunday, April 4th Easter! We had church inperson (outside). I thought it was going to be cold so I wore a blazer &packed a blanket, but by the time the service started it was actually reallywarm. It was a gorgeous day and a lovely service.  Meanwhile, Dr. M had anangelic visitation of another sort. Monday, April 5th  Iwas texting with my brother and he asked if I’d read the latest book in one ofthe series that we like (Craig Johnson’s Walt Longmire series) & I saidthat I didn’t know there was a new one! So I went to Goodreads to get it addedto my “to read” list & saw this. In my defense, I added it a week beforethe book was released, so I knew it would be a while before I could get it fromthe library. But really, to forget it even existed? Very sad.

{"title": "Book Reviews – the March Edition", "date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2021", "text": "Ionly read three and a half books in March (I’m counting the novella as one halfof a book).    1. The Switch, by Beth O’Leary. ★★★★★ Eileenis sick of being 79. Leena's tired of life in her twenties. Maybe it's timethey swapped places... The Bug Says: Eileenlives in a small village in Yorkshire and Leena lives in London. When theyswitch places shenanigans ensue. I enjoyed this book quite a lot – it was anice light foil to all the murder books I read.  2. The Once andFuture Witches,by Alix Harrow. ★★★★ In 1893, there's no such thing aswitches. There used to be, in the wild, dark days before the burnings began,but now witching is nothing but tidy charms and nursery rhymes. If the modernwoman wants any measure of power, she must find it at the ballot box.But when the Eastwood sisters--James Juniper, Agnes Amaranth, and BeatriceBelladonna--join the suffragists of New Salem, they begin to pursue theforgotten words and ways that might turn the women's movement into the witch'smovement. Stalked by shadows and sickness, hunted by forces who will not suffera witch to vote-and perhaps not even to live-the sisters will need to delveinto the oldest magics, draw new alliances, and heal the bond between them ifthey want to survive.There's no such thing as witches. But there will be.  The Bug Says: Oh mygoodness – what a good book! You can see in my picture above that I had a nicesatisfying cry when it was over. I really like how this author builds worldsand the characters she creates (she also wrote The Ten Thousand Doors of January). I highly recommend this one!  3. Fractured (Will Trent #2), by Karin Slaughter. ★★★★ Ansley Park is one ofAtlanta’s most upscale neighborhoods—but in one gleaming mansion, in ateenager’s lavish bedroom, a girl has been savagely murdered. And in thehallway, her mother stands amid shattered glass, having killed her daughter’sattacker with her bare hands. Detective Will Trent of the Georgia Bureau ofInvestigation is one of the first on the scene. Trent soon sees something thatthe Atlanta cops are missing, something in the trail of blood, in a matrix offorensic evidence, and in the eyes of the stunned mother. When another teenagegirl goes missing, Trent knows that this case, which started in the best ofhomes, is about to cut quick and deep through the ruins of perfect lives brokenwide-open: where human demons emerge with a vengeance. The Bug Says: You mightrecall that I read the first book in this series last month (Triptych). This one was also reallygood. I usually enjoy a good police detective book & this one did notdisappoint.  4. Normal, by Warren Ellis. ★★★ Some peoplecall it \"abyss gaze.\" Gaze into the abyss all day and the abyss willgaze into you. There are two types of people who think professionally about thefuture: foresight strategists are civil futurists who think aboutgeo-engineering and smart cities and ways to evade Our Coming Doom; strategicforecasters are spook futurists, who think about geopolitical upheaval anddrone warfare and ways to prepare clients for Our Coming Doom. The former arepaid by nonprofits and charities, the latter by global security groups andcorporate think tanks.For both types, if you're good at it, and you spendyour days and nights doing it, then it's something you can't do for long.Depression sets in. Mental illness festers. And if the \"abyss gaze\"takes hold there's only one place to recover: Normal Head, in the wilds ofOregon, within the secure perimeter of an experimental forest. The Bug Says: Someonegave this book to Dr. M to read and I decided that I might enjoy it. It sort of  has a spy novel flavor to it.The main character has a nervous breakdown and goes to Normal Head to recover,but then someone goes missing and he rouses all the patients to solve themystery. It’s really more of a novella, but even at that there is a LOT oftheoretical language from all the characters about their particular brand ofstrategy & their particular mental illness. I started skimming it because Ifrankly didn’t understand about half of what they were saying. I will say thatthe mystery was actually pretty interesting – I was surprised by whodunit.  I’malready almost finished with the 3rd Will Trent book – it’s pretty goodtoo. After that, who knows? I might have to reread some old favorites until my nextlibrary book is available. Are you reading anything good these days?"},

I’m sure things will settle down as theyear progresses.    1. The Queen'sGambit, by Walter Tevis. ★★★★★When eight-year-old Beth Harmon’sparents are killed in an automobile accident, she’s placed in an orphanage inMount Sterling, Kentucky. Plain and shy, Beth learns to play chess from thejanitor in the basement and discovers she is a prodigy. Though penniless, sheis desperate to learn more—and steals a chess magazine and enough money toenter a tournament. Beth also steals some of her foster mother’s tranquilizersto which she is becoming addicted.

But another player has entered the game: aloser ex-con who has stumbled upon the killer's trail in the most coincidentalof ways—someone who may be the key to breaking the case wide open. The Bug Says: Thatdescription up there is almost entirely incorrect – it makes me laugh so I’mleaving it. There is a serial killer and the latest victim is in Atlanta (themutilation part is correct). The book is written from three perspectives andyou slowly realize that at least one of them is not what you think. It was verywell done. I’m reading book two in the series now.  3. Faithlessin Death (In Death #52), by J.D. Robb.★★★★★ The scene in the West Village studio appears to be classiccrime-of-passion: two wine glasses by the bed, music playing, and a youngsculptor named Ariel Byrd with the back of her head bashed in. But when Dallastracks down the wealthy Upper East Side woman who called 911, the details don'tadd up. Gwen Huffman is wealthy, elegant, comforted by her handsome fiancé asshe sheds tears over the trauma of finding the body--but why did it take anhour to report it? And why is she lying about little things?As Eve and her team look into Gwen, her past, and the people around her, theyfind that the lies are about more than murder. As with sculpture, they need tochip away at the layers of deception to find the shape within--and soon they'regetting the FBI involved in a case that involves a sinister, fanatical groupand a stunning criminal conspiracy.As Eve and her team look into Gwen, her past, and the people around her, theyfind that the lies are about more than murder. As with sculpture, they need tochip away at the layers of deception to find the shape within--and soon they'regetting the FBI involved in a case that involves a sinister, fanatical groupand a stunning criminal conspiracy. The Bug Says: Anotherfabulous Eve Dallas book. They are always very satisfactory – especially whenEve gets to show some overbearing man that she’s better than he is.  4. AgathaRaisin and the Wellspring of Death (Agatha Raisin #7), by M.C.Beaton (Alias), Marion Chesney.★★★Agatha Raisin's neighbouring village of Ancombe is usually the epitome ofquiet rural charm, but the arrival of a new mineral-water company - whichintends to tap into the village spring - sends tempers flaring and divides theparish council into two stubborn camps. When Agatha, who just happens to behandling the PR for the water company, finds the council chairman murdered atthe basin of the spring, tongues start wagging. Could one of the councilmembers have polished off the chairman before he could cast the deciding vote? The Bug Says: Yes, I readanother one. The thing is that these books are almost always available when I’mwaiting on another book that’s on hold at the library. This one was slightlyless annoying than the last one. Is that a ringing endorsement or what? 5. I'm JudgingYou: The Do-Better Manual, by LuvvieAjayi Jones. ★★★★★ Comedian,activist, and hugely popular culture blogger at AwesomelyLuvvie.com, LuvvieAjayi, serves up necessary advice for the common senseless in this hilariousbook of essays. With over 500,000 readers a month at her enormously popularblog, AwesomelyLuvvie.com, Luvvie Ajayi has become a go-to source for smarttakes on pop culture. I'm Judging You is her debut book ofhumorous essays that dissects our cultural obsessions and calls out badbehavior in our increasingly digital, connected lives—from the importance of thenewest Shonda Rhimes television drama to serious discussions of race and mediarepresentation to what to do about your fool cousin sharing casket picturesfrom Grandma's wake on Facebook. With a lighthearted, razor-sharp wit and aunique perspective, I'm Judging You is the audiobook the worldneeds, doling out the hard truths and a road map for bringing some \"actright\" into our lives, social media, and popular culture.  The Bug Says: I startedfollowing Luvvie on Instagram. I think she’s hilarious, and this book is definitelyfull of her pithy commentary. But there are also some hard truths (especiallyabout racism) that made me sit up & take notice. Her second book was justpublished this last week & it’s on my list to get soon! Whatare you reading these days?"},

Therewere unflattering selfies, and there were priceless gifts. And I am GLAD THATWEEK IS OVER. Sunday, February 28th Daffies! Andmushrooms! Monday, March 1st Mytemperature blanket through February (including my “key” in case you’reinterested).  Tuesday, March 2nd  I went to bed with one ofthe worst toothaches I’ve ever had. I reapplied orajel about every 20 minutes& finally fell asleep around 2:30 a.m. I was so glad that my dentist officehad an opening that afternoon! Not quite as excited to find out I needed a rootcanal. Even LESS excited when I got my appointment notification & saw howlong the appointment is going to last (hahahaha!). I was given antibiotics, butas I’m writing this (on Sunday) my tooth still randomly hurts like bejesus.   Wednesday, March 3rd– My Birthday!    I had a meeting in theoffice in the morning & then took the rest of the day off. Got my hair done– and since it was a three hour process I’m making you live through all thestages. You’re welcome. While I was there my cousin friend stopped by todeliver birthday goodies (her daughter is my hairdresser).  I love my new hair, and Iloved having pizza and cake for my birthday dinner.  Twilight. Thursday, March 4thI started for work this morning (had a VERY IMPORTANTAPPOINTMENT I DIDN’T WANT TO MISS), heard something clunk, the battery light cameon, and I ignored all that & tried to go on my merry way. With no powersteering. That woke me up. I parked the car, rudely woke Dr. M up & stolehis car. Turns out the serpentine belt had come off, which apparently hasnegative consequences if you keep trying to drive the car. But enough aboutthat – my VERY IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT was to get the first shot of the COVID vaccine!Our group (essential workers who provide services to frontline workers) openedup this week. I was so excited & grateful that I almost didn’t mind that mytooth was still hurting like a mother (can you tell that I’m getting saltier aswe go along?). My next shot is in three weeks – the day after my root canal. Friday, March 5thThings I got for my birthday(not pictured: $$$). It was a pretty good year for birthday loot! Saturday, March 6th MY TOOTH WAS STILL BOTHERINGME, so I had birthday cake for lunch. Meanwhile, Dr. M started working onDaisy.  The pluses this week werepretty good – birthday hair & a vaccine. But the minuses were pretty minus.I sure hope the antibiotic starts doing its thing soon or it’s going to be along three weeks. On the other hand, Dr. M finished up working on the cartoday. Woo hoo! He looks like he’s been through a war, and his clothes lookworse, but the belt is on the car & it seems to be working. And fromhenceforward we are taking the car to a professional for any further repairs.Ha! Are you a handy person? I personally am not."},

Best we can figure, she left the cleaner sitting beside the back door, where she had been using it. Apparently I picked it up and put it in the rag bag where it lives? (Vague memory.) THEN, or so we would have you believe, the cleaner leapt of its own accord from the rag bag into the nearby recycling can. From there, it was unceremoniously dumped into the outside bin, where it was unearthed after an exhaustive indoor search (not to mention two less thorough looks into the big bin).(Note from The Bug: you can't see it very well, but there is a stink bug on the counter in the last picture with the cleaner. Stink bugs are like cats. You don't want them on the counter. You tell them to stay off the counter. They go where they will.)"},

Last weekend I cleaned our frontand back doors (I know – I’m amazed too!). When I was done I thought to myself,“I have sat the glass cleaner in a place where I won’t remember to put it away.”Well. Yesterday I remembered that little conversation with myself & went tofind the cleaner & put it away. I. CANNOT. FIND. IT. I told Dr. M that I wasgaslighting my own self. We have looked everywhere! All the cabinets. Thefreezer. The recycle bin. The dirty clothes hamper. Outside (we’ve both walkedaround the outside of the house.). I even looked in a couple of my yarn bags. UnlessI just threw it away for some reason it should NOT be that hard to find! Whatthe heck. If we ever figure it out I will definitely let you know.  Sunday, February 21st    Anotherof my Christmas presents was this flowering tea. I finally decided to try itout. Very cool! I didn’t like the taste much (it’s green tea – blech), but itsmelled heavenly. Can’t wait to try some of the other ones.  Monday, February 22ndNewmask alert! I had to have it. Theoretically this is my last one. Theoretically.(In case you can’t read it, the quote is the last line from Amanda Gorman’s inaugurationpoem: “There is always light if only we’re brave enough to see it. If only we’rebrave enough to be it.”) It's also reversible - I love the polka dots.  Twilight. Tuesday, February 23rdI was crocheting whilewatching a webinar for work. The subject matter was flying right over my head! Wednesday, February24th    Spring is coming! It was aglorious day! Thursday, February25thYou may recall my post about this scarf a while back.I had snagged the very first row on something sharp & it cut the yarn in away that I couldn’t figure out how to repair. So I frogged the whole thing& made QUITE a mess (including that cute little yarn heart on the floor!).Fortunately it is all sorted back out now & I’ve restarted the scarf. Friday, February 26thI told Dr. M I was in themood to try the bean soup mix we’ve had forever. Here is what he said about it:“Tonight seemed like a great night for Bob’s Red Mill black bean soup! I soakedthe beans all day and rinsed them. Base was yellow onion and fennel stalks inplace of celery. Garlic, sea salt, fresh ground pepper, basil, oregano, thyme,paprika, and diced cumin seeds seasoned the base. Could have used another boxof veggie broth, but one and extra water will have to do. Added fire-roastedtomatoes, cubed butternut squash, and whole kernel corn. Recipe found on backof soup package.” It was REALLY good ya’ll! Saturday, February27th  Weekly temperature blanketupdate. Brand new color alert! Not only did I get to use the chartreuse thisweek, but the temps were high enough to use strawberry! Very exciting! As I’m writing this Dr. M isroaming around the house hoping that he can surprise the window cleaner out ofhiding. It’s not working. Have you lost anything lately?"},

I was super annoyed because I was playing a timed game on my iPad, butI VERY UNGRACIOUSLY let a couple of coworkers in. Only to find out that I hadwon the mask decorating contest. Oh my goodness – look at this basket! I felt simultaneouslytwo inches tall and 10 feet tall. Lesson to self: be a nicer person.

These four colors cover a 20 degree spread (31 to 50 degrees) &since I’m using the average temp that seems about right for this time of year.  I tried to not get my hopesup for any kind of political miracle, so I wasn’t too surprised or disappointedby the acquittal of our former president yesterday. But I was disgusted by Mitch McConnell’scommentary afterward. He basically said that he would have voted to convict,but congress didn’t have jurisdiction since the proceeding was for a former president. Um, well, Mitch, hewasn’t former when you got theArticles of Impeachment, so you could have acted on them then. Ugh.

{"title": "Book Reviews – the January Edition", "date": "Wednesday, February 10, 2021", "text": "Ihit the ground running in January. I actually read 6 books, but I’m not listingone of them here (it was a re-read of an old Nora Roberts book because I neededsome comfort food for my brain).   1. Seventy SevenClocks (Bryant & May, the Peculiar CrimesUnit #3) by Christopher Fowler. ★★★★A mysterious stranger in outlandish Edwardian garbdefaces a painting in the National Gallery. Then a guest at the exclusive SavoyHotel is fatally bitten by what appears to be a marshland snake. An outbreak ofincreasingly bizarre crimes has hit London — and, fittingly, come to theattention of the Peculiar Crimes Unit. Art vandalism, an exploding suspect, pornography,rat poison, Gilbert and Sullivan musicals, secret societies...and not a singlesuspect in sight. The killer they're chasing has a dark history, a habit ofstaying hidden, and time itself on his side. Detectives John May and ArthurBryant may have finally met their match, and this time they're really workingagainst the clock...  The Bug Says: Bryant andMay are two very different men, which makes their partnership fun for thereader. The first book in the series takes place in “present day” when thedetectives are much older. The next two are flashbacks to former cases. Thisone takes place in 1973 & that in itself was very entertaining – I lovedreading about the fashions and attitudes. And the mystery in this one isexcellent – I would never in a million years have figured out the villain!  2. The Silent Corner (Jane Hawk #1),by Dean Koontz. ★★★★ “I very much need to be dead.” These arethe chilling words left behind by a man who had everything to live for—but tookhis own life. In the aftermath, his widow, Jane Hawk, does what all her grief,fear, and fury demand: find the truth, no matter what.  Peopleof talent and accomplishment, people admired and happy and sound of mind, havebeen committing suicide in surprising numbers. When Jane seeks to learn why,she becomes the most-wanted fugitive in America. Her powerful enemies areprotecting a secret so important—so terrifying—that they will exterminateanyone in their way. Butall their power and viciousness may not be enough to stop a woman as clever asthey are cold-blooded, as relentless as they are ruthless—and who is driven bya righteous rage they can never comprehend. Because it is born of love. The Bug Says: This was adifferent kind of Koontz book – no aliens, no supernatural situations, justpure human evil. It was excellent! I’m a little nervous about what will happenin the next book, but this one was quite satisfactory.  3. Neverwhere,by Neil Gaiman. ★★★★ Under thestreets of London there's a place most people could never even dream of. A cityof monsters and saints, murderers and angels, knights in armour and pale girlsin black velvet. This is the city of the people who have fallen between thecracks.Richard Mayhew, a young businessman, is going to find out more than enoughabout this other London. A single act of kindness catapults him out of hisworkday existence and into a world that is at once eerily familiar and utterlybizarre. And a strange destiny awaits him down here, beneath his native city:Neverwhere.  The Bug Says: I don’tknow which I enjoyed more, the book itself, or the author narrating the book. Iseem to be drawn to books where hapless men find themselves in situations wherethey need to be heroes. This is in contrast to the books about women that Iprefer – I want women to be strong protagonists. So, hapless man, strong woman,quest to right a wrong – count me in! This book was written in 1996 & there’sapparently going to be a sequel, of sorts.  4. The TranscendentKingdom, by Yaa Gyasi. ★★★★★ Yaa Gyasi's stunning follow-up toher acclaimed national best seller Homegoing is a powerful, raw, intimate, deeplylayered novel about a Ghanaian family in Alabama. Gifty is a fifth yearcandidate in neuroscience at Stanford School of Medicine studying rewardseeking behavior in mice and the neural circuits of depression and addiction.Her brother, Nana, was a gifted high school athlete who died of a heroinoverdose after an ankle injury left him hooked on OxyContin. Her suicidalmother is living in her bed. Gifty is determined to discover the scientificbasis for the suffering she sees all around her. But even as she turns to thehard sciences to unlock the mystery of her family's loss, she finds herselfhungering for her childhood faith, and grappling with the evangelical church inwhich she was raised, whose promise of salvation remains as tantalizing as itis elusive. Transcendent Kingdom is a deeply moving portrait of a family ofGhanain immigrants ravaged by depression and addiction and grief--a novel aboutfaith, science, religion, love. Exquisitely written, emotionally searing, thisis an exceptionally powerful follow-up to Gyasi's phenomenal debut. The Bug Says: This booksmoves back and forth between present day and the events that lead up to all thetragedy in Gifty’s life. Her remembrances of her evangelical church aren’t thesame as mine (they were Pentecostal), but her questions about God do remind meof my own questions. This book was so deep that I think I need to read itagain! 5. Agatha Raisinand the Terrible Tourist (Agatha Raisin #6),by M.C. Beaton. ★★★ Agatha travels to Cyprus, only to contend with her estrangedfiance, an egregious group of truly terrible tourists, and a string ofmurders... The Bug Says: This is thebook I was listening to in that picture where I was rolling my eyes last week.Agatha just needs to quit chasing after her neighbor (she followed him toCyprus for heaven’s sake, when she knew he just wanted to get away from her).The mysteries are interesting, but I do get tired of the high school drama froma woman in her 50s. Also, the narrator makes all the women (except the vicar’swife) sound like harridans. That said, I’m already reading the 7thbook in the series. Ha!  I’mcurrently reading three books – the first one in a new detective series, theaforementioned Agatha Raisin, and The Queen’s Gambit. In fact, I need to get offof this computer & get to reading. I was going to ask if you’d readanything good lately, but really I do not need to be adding any books to mylist. (But tell me anyway J)."},

I found this picture on my phone later – I apparentlytook it when I was purchasing an emotional support pretzel. I knew that my ironwas probably low because I’ve been craving ice, and apparently picadue to low iron is really a thing. Although mine isn’t that low.  On my way home I stopped byto see Daddy & Sue. They requested some printed photos of our newest bundleof joy, and Dr. M got right on that for them. He printed 14 pictures, includingthis one. So adorable! Twilight… Thursday, February4thI took the wall hanging into the office to see what Ithink. It’s probably going to go on that wall (I tested it on a couple existingnails), but I brought it back home to crochet some loops to hang it from a rod.I think it will look better that way than just putting 5 nails in the wall (myoriginal plan). Friday, February 5thGiven my low iron situationI decided to try to eat more spinach. Only you can’t even see the spinach onthis salad with a whole chopped apple on top! From Facebook: Inother news, I’ve spent the morning in my office just flat out talking tomyself. Actual conversations. Discussions of tactics for a project. Arguments.TGIF? Stopped at Daddy & Sue’sagain (to deliver the pictures), and Daddy discovered this tack in my boot. Howlong has it been there? How did it get there? Yikes! Dr. M fixed himself brusselssprouts in the air fryer. Blech. Tiny little cabbages.  Saturday, February6th  Dr. M’s dad was dangerouslylow on propane – we were pretty nervous because we had a couple of really coldnights – but thank goodness they came today to fill the tank! Made myself a giant omeletwith spinach, tomato, & cheese. Ate half.  Tried to repair my kitchengloves using electrical tape & duct tape (I had done my usual thing ofslicing holes in the fingers while washing knives). This did NOT work at all. 0out of 10 – do not recommend.  I really need to take downour Christmas decorations. Maybe not the tree – it’s not in the way, and itstill makes us smile.

The leftover pizza, while tasty, just seemed very heavy to me soI decided to zing it up with sliced apples. It was really good! Wednesday, January27th  Leftover pizza, take two. Thistime I mixed up a little salad with apples, feta, spinach, & Italian dressing,and dumped that on my pizza. While it was also tasty, logistically it wasimpossible to eat. If the crust hadn’t been so crispy I could have rolled theslices up & sort of had a pizza taco situation.  Took another stretching class.We were supposed to use a tennis ball, but in the moment this was the onlything we could find – ha! I think it’s hilarious that we have a WashingtonNationals plushie when we’re not really Nationals fans.  Thursday, January 28thTwilight… I finished my wall hanging! So glad to have had theMake Don’t Break challenge to get me in gear this month.  The moon! (Slightly past full because of pouring rain Wednesdaynight.) Friday, January 29thSince I finished my wallhanging, and since I was still waiting on a skein of yarn for my temperatureblanket, I started a new project. I was playing around with color combos &decided that using the off white worked best. This one will be a can cozy.Maybe.  Saturday, January 30th Temperature blanket update. My chartreuse yarn came! It’s either going to be hideous or a “pop of color.” I kind of likeit – looks like spring to me. Which means we shouldn’t have had thistemperature (51 degrees) in January. Of course, last year we had about 5 daysof 60+ degree temps in the middle of January, so what do I know? I spent alittle time rearranging my warm color ranges. As most of you know, the last time I made atemperature blanket I had a LOT of orange. I’m trying to avoid that this time.We’ll see how it goes. Also, down here in NC I’m thinking I won’t end up usingmy coolest colors (for average temps 30 degrees & lower). Now if I wasstill in Ohio... I’ve been feeling a littleblue this week. With my personality, when I feel blue I tend to just crawlinside myself and stuff all that blue in a corner where it can be ignored. Then eat some chocolate. This time I’ve tried to “sit with my feelings” (whatever theheck that means), and I have to say that I Am Not A Fan. I mean, I don’t evenwant to eat chocolate when I do that. Who needs that stress in their life? Howabout you – are you a feeler or a stuffer?"},

See the end of the post for a preview of what I was up to.  Sunday, January 10th Youmight remember that late last year one of the strands on my Fitbit band broke.I decided to try to repair it. I knew that the repair wouldn’t last because Iwas using thin thread, and it didn’t – but now I know what to do once I get theright materials. Monday, January 11thNophoto. Well, there was my “Make Don’t Break” photo, but it’s too similar to theone I’m using for Saturday. Tuesday, January12th  The last time I made atemperature blanket I stopped weaving in the ends around July or so. I AM NOTGOING TO DO THAT THIS TIME!  Wednesday, January13th  Twilight in the hollow. (Perpopular demand, this week features a lot of Dr. M photos.) Thursday, January 14th Took a stretching class because I am possibly theleast limber person you will meet. The moon! Friday, January 15thThemoon! (And my favorite color of sky) Saturday, January 16thI couldn’t decide what toput on my egg salad sandwich, so I had a bit of everything: potato chips,Cheetos, and chili cheese corn chips. It was very good, but the corn chips kindof overpowered the egg salad. Just in case you decide to make one of these foryourself. Twilight. Weekly update of thetemperature blanket (yes, this is now a thing). I don’t know what I think aboutthe colors, but as we all know, when April comes around there will be bigchanges that make it look completely different. Will I like it then? We shallsee! The moon! Here’s the sneak peek intowhat I was up to yesterday. Look how long his toeses are!  This week promises morecraziness. I am praying for a drama free inauguration. Do we think that canactually happen?"},
{"title": "Book Reviews – the December Edition", "date": "Wednesday, January 13, 2021", "text": "InDecember I tried to reach my (rather modest) reading goal for 2020, but Icouldn’t quite get there. I ended up reading 58 books for the year, down from76 the year before. My goal was just 60 because I knew that I wanted to listento more podcasts & that would eat into my reading time. But I didn’t dothat either. I reread some old favorites, and mostly played games on my iPad.Most of my “reading” was audiobooks, but my work commute is pretty short.Anyway, in my dash toward the end of the year I read seven books in December! I think I’ll try to shorten thedescriptions so there isn’t quite as much to get through.  1. The Turn of theKey, by Ruth Ware. ★★★ Rowan Caine lies to obtain a nannyposition at a remote house in Scotland. The book opens with her in a prisoncell; she has been arrested for murdering one of the children. In a series ofletters to an attorney, she maintains her innocence & tell the story of howshe got there. The Bug Says: There wereaspects of this book that annoyed me (the house is a “smart” house and & Iwas very impatient with her technical illiteracy), but the twist at the endended up making it worth the read.2. FallingFree: Rescued from the Life I Always Wanted, by Shannan Martin. ★★★★Shannan Martin had the perfect life: a cute farmhouse on six rambling acres, aloving husband, three adorable kids, money, friends, a close-knit church—asafe, happy existence. But when the bottom dropped out through a series ofshocking changes and ordinary inconveniences, the Martins followed God’s callto something radically different: a small house on the other side of the urbantracks, a shoestring income, a challenged public school, and the harshness of acounty jail (where her husband is now chaplain). And yet the family’s plungefrom “safety” was the best thing that could have happened to them. The Bug Says: I followShannan on Instagram & find her to be a pragmatic lovely soul who talksopenly about moving from conservative Republicanism to becoming something alittle more like Christ would like us to be (hint: that’s not necessarily ableeding heart liberal Democrat). In fact, our “Christ-likeness” doesn’tactually depend on our politics (shocker!). Anyway, this book tells thebeginning of her journey and I enjoyed it quite a lot. 3. The Wide Window (ASeries of Unfortunate Events #3), by Lemony Snicket. ★★★ Ifyou have not read anything about the Baudelaire orphans, then before you readeven one more sentence, you should know this: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny arekindhearted and quick-witted; but their lives, I am sorry to say, are filledwith bad luck and misery. All of the stories about these three children areunhappy and wretched, and this one may be the worst of them all. If you haven'tgot the stomach for a story that includes a hurricane, a signalling device,hungry leeches, cold cucumber soup, a horrible villain, and a doll named PrettyPenny, then this book will probably fill you with despair. I will continue torecord these tragic tales, for that is what I do. You, however, should decidefor yourself whether you can possibly endure this miserable story.The Bug Says: This iswhere I started trying to read short things to get me over the book finishline. I’ve read a couple of other Lemony Snicket books and this one wasn’t myfavorite, but I enjoy these because of how the author will use a word, and thengive a definition of the word that is hilarious. (Note: if it’s not apparentfrom the description, this is actually a children’s book.) 4. The Mystery ofMeerkat Hill (Precious Ramatswe’s Very FirstCase), by Alexander McCall Smith. ★★★★★Precious wants to be adetective when she grows up. She is always practicing at being a detective byasking questions and finding out about other people’s lives. There are two newstudents in her class, a girl called Teb and a boy called Pontsho. She learnsthat they are brother and sister, and—even more exciting—that Pontsho has aclever pet meerkat named Kosi. One day, Teb and Pontsho’s family’s cow disappears. Precious helps them lookfor clues to find the cow. But getting the cow back home will require somequick thinking and help from an unexpected source. The Bug Says: This was ashort story about the main character from the No. One Ladies' Detective Agencyseries. I thoroughly enjoyed it! It would be appropriate as a children’s booktoo.  5. & 6 Agatha Raisinand the Walkers of Wembley (★★★)and Agatha Raisin and the Murderous Marriage (★★★★) (AgathaRaisin #s 4 & 5), by M.C. Beaton. More Agatha Raisin silliness – she finally catches herneighbor and then loses him again, all against the backdrop of murder.  The Bug Says: AgathaRaisin amuses me – her mysteries are your typical British village mysteries,but definitely on the silly side.  7. The LimpopoAcademy of Private Detection (No. 1 Ladies’Detective Agency #13), by Alexander McCall Smith. ★★★★ PreciousRamotswe is very busy these days. The best apprentice at Tlokweng Road SpeedyMotors is in trouble with the law and stuck with the worst lawyer in Gaborone.Grace Makutsi and Phuti Radiphuti are building the house of their dreams, buttheir builder is not completely on the up and up. Most shockingly, MmaPotokwane, the orphan farm’s respected matron, has been dismissed from herpost. Mma Ramotswe is not about to rest when her friends are mistreated. Helparrives from an unexpected visitor. He is none other than the estimable Mr.Clovis Andersen, author of The Principles of Private Detection, the No. 1Ladies’ prized manual. Together, Mma Ramotswe, Mma Makutsi, and their colleaguehelp right injustices that occur even in their beloved Botswana, and in theprocess discover something new about being a good detective.  The Bug Says: There isjust something about Mma Ramatswe’s brand of wisdom that pulls me in and makesme want to stay awhile. I will say that Mma Makutsi was extra annoying in thisbook – Mma Ramatswe has a lot more patience for her than I do. And that’sanother valuable lesson for me to learn!And so another year of books has come to an end. I finished the two books thatI needed for my goal this past week - just a smidge too late to count - and I’m on to another one. We’ll see if Ican hit my goal in 2021. What good things have you been reading lately?"},
{"title": "2021 Project 365 – Week Two", "date": "Sunday, January 10, 2021", "text": "What a crazy week! I was SOHAPPY to wake up on Wednesday morning to hear about the two new Georgia senators,but then the madness at the capitol overshadowed that good news. I was afraidand outraged, and so upset about the fact that those rioters made it inside thebuilding with little to no resistance. The images were so disturbing – the confederateflag inside the capitol, the guy with the zip ties to use as handcuffs, thelone black police officer trying to hold back the crowd… It will be a whilebefore I can fully come to terms with it all, but my overwhelming feeling rightnow is a kind of righteous rage. This is not who we are as a country? It isEXACTLY who we are and always have been: a nation of people who have been toldby white men who are afraid that they might lose power that people with brownskin are inferior and undeserving of basic rights. In fact, I think that almosteverything that we’ve been told to fear is because of people who want to stayin power, because if we weren’t afraid we might think for ourselves and voteaccordingly.  ANYWAY, my week in photosdoesn’t really reflect any of that turmoil. Sunday, January 3rdMysister-in-law gave me this puzzle and it was THE MOST FUN EVER! I’ve never madea 3D puzzle before – I definitely recommend it.  Dr.M likes to take photos of twilight in our holler but I hardly ever post them. Ithought we might need it this week. Monday, January 4thIworked on my wall hanging while starting a new audiobook. I lovelistening to Neil Gaiman read his books.  Mynephew with his baby. I probably won’t spam you with baby pictures every week.But maybe I will. Tuesday, January 5th I’m not going to share everyMake Don’t Break photo, but this is the only picture for the day. I know I wasgoing to work on the wall hanging project (from Monday’s photo), but I got abug & decided to work on an even older WIP. Wednesday, January6th  Crocheting and watching history. What the heck. Thursday, January7th  Someone took one of Dr. M’s moonphotos and had it framed. We still don’t know who did it. How cool is that?  Friday, January 8thWellpeople, we knew this would happen. I know I wasn’t going to start on thetemperature blanket until after I finished the wall hanging, but my yarn came,so… Saturday, January 9thI haven’t shared one of myweird food creations in a while. Today’s omelet is egg, spinach, leftover fieldpeas, and cheese. It was GOOD. I should probably have drained the field peas(it was a bit messy), but really the juice is the best part! I got into bed late last night& checked my “mileage.” Then I looked at yesterday’s “mileage.” CueTwilight Zone music!  You know, I’m thinking thatit's just going to be crazy from now on. I mean, there will be thefallout from the attempted coup this week, plus I haven’t even talked about howCOVID is out of control even as we’re trying to get vaccinated. Do you haveanything that is keeping you calm during our current madness? I could use sometips!"},
{"title": " 2021 Project 365 – Week One", "date": "Saturday, January 2, 2021", "text": "We made it to the new year!Amazingly, it feels pretty much the same as the old year… Sunday, December 27thBefore& After. I went to church (I was the liturgist) and then came home &got right back into my Christmas jammies.  Monday, December 28thIspent a RIDICULOUS amount of time planning my new temperature blanket. I usedlast year’s temps to see what it would look like with 5 or 10 degree ranges forcolor changes (I'm going with 5 degree), and also tried to find a pattern that wouldn’t end up being amonster like the last blanket (pictured, in case you had forgotten).  Tuesday, December 29th Hair mood. The (almost) full moon! Wednesday, December30th  I told Dr. M that I was going to wear this to work. Hesaid that the jacket did match the shoes, but he was laughing, so… Thursday, December31stChickpea bok choy soup – it wasGOOD! Friday, January 1stIstayed up WAY TOO LATE on New Year’s Eve waiting on this little gentleman’sarrival. Although he wasn’t due until January 17th, Little Graysondecided to come a bit early. His mom started having contractions on Thursdaymorning. I got to bed around 1:30 am, and it turns out that he was born at 1:20am (our time – they’re in Oklahoma), but I didn’t find out until I woke up.Brandon is my nephew and had been stationed in South Korea. They made it backstateside just in time – their furniture is still on its way. It was all veryexciting – theirs was the first 2021 baby at that hospital & city.ForJanuary I’m participating in a Make Don’t Break challenge on Instagram. We're getting motivational emails each day, and theonly rule is that we have to work on making something every day. My plan is tofinish up some WIPs before I get started on my temp blanket. Here’s the firstone – my dad basically wanted a skull cap to keep the top of his head warm. Ihope this works for him. It ended up being Dallas Cowboys colors, which was NOTplanned. Saturday, January2ndMy next finished WIP – the hatthat I was making last week. It finally started actually looking like a hat. Whew!  Here is something wild. YesterdayI did a test run of the temperature blanket pattern that I’ve decided to use. Iwanted to make sure it wasn’t too worky & that the yarn I plan to use willbe ok. It was all fine. Today I went to record the temperature for yesterday (I’musing the average temp for the day), and it was in the range for the color thatI used for the test! Cue Twilight Zone music… Did you guys do anything funfor NYE? You know what I did – nervously crocheted & played games waitingon Mr. Grayson to be born. It was time well spent!P.S. This coming week is a big deal for our democracy - I'll be praying for Georgia and that the shenanigans during the electoral vote roll call aren't too disruptive!"},

I stillhave a few gifts to distribute (due to them not being here yet), but I think wehad a pretty successful holiday. It was EXTRA low key – so much so that afterSunday there aren’t very many photos. Also, I haven’t read blogs sinceWednesday, but I’ll get around to everyone today or tomorrow. Sunday, December 20thImade banana pomegranate apple bread! It was really good! Although I might leaveout the pomegranates next time – they didn’t really add to the flavor &that’s a waste of pomegranates to me.  Hereare my coworker gifts for this year – pretty cute! I had to learn Tunisiancrochet to make the little scarves. It was ok, but I definitely need to get betterat it before I would attempt anything larger. Ialso finally made us one of the ornaments that I made last year. It is a littlebit on the homely side. I really struggle with pairing colors – obviously! Thebiggest problem is that I LOVE that green, but it rarely actually looks verygood mixed with other colors.  Monday, December 21stDr.M made zucchini fries in the air fryer. They were really good! Tuesday, December 22ndThe only picture today itthis random selfie. I have no idea. Maybe I was checking that my hair wasn’tcrazy? I look a little maniacal.   Wednesday, December23rdOne of the lilies in my anniversary bouquet finallyopened up. It’s gorgeous!Thursday, December24thWe did a very brief giftexchange with Daddy & Sue. On a whim, I had made a Mickey (Minnie?) Mouseoutfit for Sue’s doll. They gave me this thermometer & could not have beenmore excited! A hypochondriac during a pandemic? DREAM PRESENT!  Friday, December 25thWetook lunch to Dr. M’s dad, rambled around the county looking at sheep, andotherwise had a lovely quiet Christmas Day.  Saturday, December26thI’m trying to make a beanie,but this looks more like a place mat. It’s not becoming the expected bowlshape. I might have to frog it & try again with a smaller hook. Stay tuned!  People, I have missed havinga big crochet project this year. I’m thinking about either doing another temperatureblanket (in some style that won’t end up being 9 feet long), or another grannysquare blanket like I’ve done in the past. Do any of you have opinions on this?Do tell! P.S. In case you missed it,I posted our annual Christmas poem on Christmas Eve. I was pretty proud of thisone."},

So here is anover-processed one for your enjoyment. Monday, December 14thOuranniversary is on the 15th, and I came home to goodies from Dr. M.He’s the best! Tuesday, December 15thAnniversary day! Thirtyyears! That just seems crazypants. I posted this photo on FB and had a coupleof folks who were happy to see the return of the hat (apparently I post thissame picture every year? Ha!). The 30th is thepearl anniversary, so Dr. M got me a couple of pearl items. The green and freshwaterpearl set is from my favorite, Feryl Designs. Back in February I hadcommissioned these portraits from someone I know just on FB. I kind of likedhis quirky style. They don’t really look much like us – I think I like thembetter if I imagine that they’re other people. Wednesday, December16thApparently Wednesday is the day that Dr. M cooks. Hereis his description on FB: Nothing for it but to make chicken soup tonight! Started with a base ofonions, white carrots, and a blend of bell and poblano peppers, added garlic,spices, and cubed yellow squash and zucchini for a summer vibe. Chicken, broth,corn, black beans, and, once all that came to a boil, a cup of orzo. Once thatcooked, I finished with chopped cilantro and the juice from a fresh lemon.Thursday, December17thFor old times’ sake I put onmy favorite lipstick – Burt’s Bees Rhubarb & then took a selfie showcasingmy ancient Santa earrings. I wiped off the lipstick the next time I put my maskback on. Friday, December 18thOurdepartment won the decorating contest & got donuts as a prize. This is nota bear claw – it’s a bigfoot claw! It had apple filling – very yummy. I alsotook a picture of my coworker’s ostrich Christmas sweater. She got shamed intotaking it off because of the unfortunate placement of the ostrich body. Therewas much hooting and hilarity. Ha! Dr.M caught the cotton candy twilight – and the moon!Saturday, December18thI have had some sort ofmalaise all during this pandemic. I don’t read, I don’t crochet – I spend allmy time scrolling Instagram and playing a game on my iPad. As a result, I haven’tmade Christmas presents like I had planned to. Here is a sneak peek at a couplethat did get completed – you’ll get to see them in all their glory next week. Are you ready for Christmas?What is it going to look like for you this year?

{"title": "Book Reviews – the November Edition", "date": "Wednesday, December 16, 2020", "text": "Amazingly, I was able to finish four books in November. I’m still notsure I’ll reach my Goodreads goal of 60 for the year (and that’s down from 75last year!). Such a weird book year.1. Ghosted, by Rosie Walsh. ★★★★ When Sarah meets Eddie, they connectinstantly and fall in love. To Sarah, it seems as though her life has finallybegun. And it's mutual: It's as though Eddie has been waiting for her, too.Sarah has never been so certain of anything. So when Eddie leaves for along-booked vacation and promises to call from the airport, she has no cause todoubt him. But he doesn't call.Sarah's friends tell her to forget about him, but she can't. She knowssomething's happened--there must be an explanation.Minutes, days, weeks go by as Sarah becomes increasingly worried. But then shediscovers she's right. There is a reason for Eddie's disappearance, and it'sthe one thing they didn't share with each other: the truth.The Bug Says: I enjoyed a lot of aspects of this book.The characters were interesting, and I was pulled along waiting to find out the“twist” that I knew was coming. For me, it did not disappoint, although theending might have been a little over the top.2. Parrot and Olivier in America,by Peter Carey. ★★★ Olivier is a youngaristocrat, one of an endangered species born in France just after theRevolution. Parrot, the son of an itinerant English printer, wanted to be anartist but has ended up in middle age as a servant. When Olivier sets sail forthe New World - ostensibly to study its prisons, but in reality to avoid yetanother revolution - Parrot is sent with him, as spy, protector, foe and foil.Through their adventures with women and money, incarceration and democracy,writing and painting, they make an unlikely pair. But where better for unlikelythings to flourish than in the glorious, brand-new experiment, America? Adazzlingly inventive reimagining of Alexis de Tocqueville's famous journey,Parrot and Olivier in America brilliantly evokes the Old World colliding withthe New. Above all, it is a wildly funny, tender portrait of two men who cometo form an almost impossible friendship, and a completely improbable work of art.The Bug Says: Someone had recommended another book bythis author, but it wasn’t available so I thought I would try this one. It gets3 stars instead of 4 because it took me a long time to get into it. I listenedto the audio version & the parts of the story from Olivier’s point of viewwere hard for me to understand at first (very strong French accent!). But thenI warmed to the characters and really enjoyed the descriptions of theirexperience in America.3. Battle Ground (The Dresden Files#17), by Jim Butcher. ★★★★ Harry has faced terrible odds before. Hehas a long history of fighting enemies above his weight class. The Red Court ofvampires. The fallen angels of the Order of the Blackened Denarius. TheOutsiders.But this time it’s different. A being more powerful and dangerous on an orderof magnitude beyond what the world has seen in a millennium is coming. Andshe’s bringing an army. The Last Titan has declared war on the city of Chicago,and has come to subjugate humanity, obliterating any who stand in her way.Harry’s mission is simple but impossible: Save the city by killing a Titan. Andthe attempt will change Harry’s life, Chicago, and the mortal world forever.The Bug Says: As the title suggests, this book was onelong battle. It took me FOREVER to read it because I just knew that someone Iliked was going to get killed. And I wasn’t wrong. But still, such a goodseries! It also feels like the “old” Harry is back – well, as back as he can bewhile still being the Winter Knight.4. The Awakening (The Dragon HeartLegacy #1), by Nora Roberts. ★★★★ When Breen Kelly was a girl, her fatherwould tell her stories of magical places. Now she’s an anxious twentysomethingmired in student debt and working a job she hates. But one day she stumblesupon a shocking discovery: her mother has been hiding an investment account inher name. It has been funded by her long-lost father—and it’s worth nearly fourmillion dollars.This newfound fortune would be life-changing for anyone. But little does Breenknow that when she uses some of the money to journey to Ireland, it will unlockmysteries she couldn’t have imagined. Here, she will begin to understand whyshe kept seeing that silver-haired, elusive man, why she imagined his voice inher head saying Come home, Breen Siobhan. It’s time you came home. Why shedreamed of dragons. And where her true destiny lies—through a portal in Galwaythat takes her to a land of faeries and mermaids, to a man named Keegan, and tothe courage in her own heart that will guide her through a powerful, dangerousdestiny…The Bug Says: I am always excited to start a new NoraRoberts trilogy. And I do enjoy when she weaves in magic and magical beings.This one was a lot of fun, but it’s just the beginning, so it left me eager toread more. I guess that’s not a bad thing.I’m currently reading aLemony Snicket book (trying to cheat and read short books to reach my goal).And I have a Dean Koontz waiting in the wings. We’ll see how it goes! Did youhave any book goals this year & how have you done?"},

I’m really not usedto having to do things – all of this stay at home business has made me soft andlazy. Okay, yes, I was always soft and lazy. ANYWAY, here are my pictures forthe week – mostly Christmas and selfies. Sunday, November 29th Wehad the nephews and their better halves over for a visit. B2 and his wife arejust back from South Korea, and B1 and his lady live in Virginia (the nerve!),so we hadn’t seen any of them in a while. Itwas the first Sunday in Advent, so I dragged out my motley crew of candles. Monday, November 30th  Itook the little tree that my mother got me to work. I can’t believe that it’s thirty two years old! It’s an antique! Meanwhile,Dr. M got the drop cord we needed so he could perfectly position our tree tomake the Christmas Tree Angel. Tuesday, December1st                                                               My brother’s birthday!

Meanwhile, Ms.Pinky & Rita are doing well. Here is what Dr. M had tosay about this meal: So tonight we’re having an Asian-American vegetarianvegetable soup, featuring a number of ingredients furnished by @misfitsmarket !The base is traditional: red onion, celery, and carrots, sautéed a bit. I addedWayne Wallace’s most excellent garlic and my favorite soup seasoning: choppedcumin seeds, along with sea salt and fresh ground pepper with a bit ofattitude. Next came soy sauce, followed by vegetable broth. Then I added chickpeas for substance. After the soup returned to a boil, I added bok choy, withthe more fibrous stem pieces going in first, then the leafy parts. Finally, Itossed in some roasted, shredded spaghetti squash!

They’refrom Dr. M’s grandmother and they’re my favorite. Thursday, December3rd         We didn’t have any otherpictures, so you get this selfie. Friday, December 4th                                                                     Feltcute.Wemade paper snowflakes at work. That was fun! Next week I should take picturesof our lobby – the ladies I work with did a FABULOUS job decorating.Dr.M got us a new seasonally appropriate ornament. Ha!Saturday, December5th                     This is how my brain works.I’ve had this little mouse for, oh, 30 years? Every year I wrestle an ornamenthook through that hole to hang it. This year I FINALLY thought to put a littlebit of yarn through there. But did I just grab a scrap from all the multitudinousyarn around me? Nope. I decided to do a bit of sewing & use the leftoverend. Yes, I stopped decorating the tree to work on a crochet project so I couldhang an ornament on the tree. The yarn doesn’t even really match. #what#welcometomybrain#christmas2020 Here’s the dinosaur hoodedblanket that I made for my nephew & his wife’s baby. I hope they like it!As predicted, it wasdifficult to get out of bed for work last week, but I survived. How about you –did you survive?"},

I’ve probablywatched The Martian, read The Martian, and listened to the audiobook of TheMartian about a blue million times now.

While there he took this picture of his dad’s (mostly feral) cats.Several of these were taken & fixed recently – hopefully the female who hadtwo litters of kittens this year was among them. Wednesday, November25th                                                          Sign from a local Hardee’s – made Dr. M laugh enoughthat he turned around just so he could snap the photo. Ha! Thursday, November26th          I couldn’t decide betweensweet or savory oatmeal this morning, so I made a small amount of each – the topone has mushrooms, a fried egg, and parm; the bottom, pomegranates and almonds.Both were delicious!Zoomsgiving! Not everyoneparticipated, but it was nice to see so many family members. Dr. M fixed us a feast! (Wegot sweet potato soufflé from my cousin.) It was all delicious! Friday, November 27th     Igot Dr. M a lava lamp for his birthday & he plugged it in today. Groovy, man! I’mworking on a surprise present for a special someone. Saturday, November28th                     Our30th anniversary is next month, and as usual we couldn’t wait untilthen to give ourselves a present. We got an air fryer/convection oven/toasteroven combo. Very excited to see what all we do with it! First, up, zucchinichips! Last week I wrote aboutbeing excited for a short workweek, and now it’s the next Saturday & I willhave to work all five days next week. It’s going to be a shock to the system.Not the actual work (I like my job); getting up early enough to get to work ontime is going to be the issue. On Thursday I woke up at 8:00, on Friday at9:02, and today at 9:16. You can see the disturbing trend. Perhaps I should aimfor 8:00 tomorrow? We shall see. Have you had a nice holiday?

{"title": "Veterans Day Remembrance Day (Almost) Wordless Wednesday", "date": "Wednesday, November 11, 2020", "text": "In a Season of Thanksgiving,We will remember youI onceagain read five books in October. Next month there will surely be fewerbecause I’ve only finished one book so far in November. I’d better get with it!1. All the Devilsare Here (Chief Inspector Armand Gamache #16), by LouisePenny. ★★★★★ On theirfirst night in Paris, the Gamaches gather as a family for a bistro dinner withArmand’s godfather, the billionaire Stephen Horowitz. Walking home togetherafter the meal, they watch in horror as Stephen is knocked down and criticallyinjured in what Gamache knows is no accident, but a deliberate attempt on theelderly man’s life.When a strange key is found in Stephen’s possession it sends Armand, his wifeReine-Marie, and his former second-in-command at the Sûreté, Jean-Guy Beauvoir,from the top of the Tour d’Eiffel, to the bowels of the Paris Archives, fromluxury hotels to odd, coded, works of art.It sends them deep into the secrets Armand’s godfather has kept for decades.The Bug Says: I just lovethis series. It was a little disappointing that this book took place in Parisinstead of Three Pines, but it was still a most excellent mystery. And it had amost satisfyingly schmaltzy ending. Highly recommend!2. Shadows in Death(In Death #51), by J.D. Robb. ★★★★★ Whena night out at the theatre is interrupted by the murder of a young woman inWashington Square Park, it seems like an ordinary case for Detective Eve Dallasand her team. But when Roarke spots a shadow from his past in the crowd, Everealises that this case is far from business as usual.Eve has two complex cases on her hands - the shocking murder of this wealthyyoung mother and tracking down the shadow before he can strike again, this timemuch closer to home. Eve is well used to being the hunter, but how will shecope when the tables are turned? As Eve and the team follow leads to Roarke'shometown in Ireland, the race is on to stop the shadow making his next move . .. The Bug Says: Anotherfavorite mystery series (obviously, since I’m on book 51!). This one included allof my favorite characters, and also had a satisfyingly schmaltzy ending.3. A Good Girl’sGuide to Murder, by Holly Jackson. ★★★★ The case is closed. Five years ago,schoolgirl Andie Bell was murdered by Sal Singh. The police know he did it.Everyone in town knows he did it.But having grown up in the same small town that was consumed by the murder,Pippa Fitz-Amobi isn't so sure. When she chooses the case as the topic for herfinal year project, she starts to uncover secrets that someone in towndesperately wants to stay hidden. And if the real killer is still out there,how far will they go to keep Pip from the truth?The Bug Says: There arelots of things to love about this book – a really bright female protagonist,her quirky family, some fun dialog, and a couple of plot twists. Also, Ilistened to the audiobook and the narrator did a really good job. 4. In Five Years,by Rebecca Serle. ★★★★ WhenType-A Manhattan lawyer Dannie Kohan is asked this question at the mostimportant interview of her career, she has a meticulously crafted answer at theready. Later, after nailing her interview and accepting her boyfriend’smarriage proposal, Dannie goes to sleep knowing she is right on track toachieve her five-year plan.But when she wakes up, she’s suddenly in a different apartment, with adifferent ring on her finger, and beside a very different man. The televisionnews is on in the background, and she can just make out the scrolling date.It’s the same night—December 15—but 2025, five years in the future.After a very intense, shocking hour, Dannie wakes again, at the brink ofmidnight, back in 2020. She can’t shake what has happened. It certainly feltmuch more than merely a dream, but she isn’t the kind of person who believes invisions. That nonsense is only charming coming from free-spirited types, likeher lifelong best friend, Bella. Determined to ignore the odd experience, shefiles it away in the back of her mind.That is, until four-and-a-half years later, when by chance Dannie meets thevery same man from her long-ago vision.The Bug Says: The premiseof this book was really interesting. It caused me to feel propelled toward adestiny that seemed inevitable, but there were some good plot twists here aswell. I zoomed through the book because I couldn’t wait to find out whathappened. It was well worth the read!5. The Ten ThousandDoors of January, by Alix E. Harrow. ★★★★ In a sprawling mansion filled withpeculiar treasures, January Scaller is a curiosity herself. As the ward of thewealthy Mr. Locke, she feels little different from the artifacts that decoratethe halls: carefully maintained, largely ignored, and utterly out of place.Then she finds a strange book. A book that carries the scent of other worlds,and tells a tale of secret doors, of love, adventure and danger. Each page turnreveals impossible truths about the world and January discovers a storyincreasingly entwined with her own. The Bug Says: Oh I lovedthis book! It was part Narnia, part A Wrinkle in Time, and part Indiana Jones, Thenarrator did a really good job, and I enjoyed every minute of it.I can’t believe I still haven’t finished the latest Harry Dresden book. Whatthe heck. I think I’m partially worried about who may or may not survive untilthe end, and also don’t want it to end. But really, I just need to buckle downand finish the thing – it’s really really good! What good things have you beenreading lately?"},

No picture – we were just hunkered down biting ournails. Friday, November 6th                                                                   Happy Election Day Part IV!I used this photo (of a painting that my friend Becci painted) to go along withsome election thoughts from Jeff Chu. You can read what he wrote here, but hereis a snippet:However this election is resolved, it’s just thebeginning, not an end. If the current administration is sent home, and it’s nomystery that this is my hope, some of us will breathe a sigh of momentaryrelief. Then the hard work will begin. So much hurt has been inflicted over thepast four years, especially on some of the most vulnerable among us. As aChinese American and as a gay man, I have felt that personally in some ways.But others have been harmed far more than I have—and one of the challenges is tobroaden my perception beyond myself. When we say “we the people,” who else hasbeen excluded? Who has gone unrecognized? Who has carried the greatest burdenof racism and white supremacy, homophobia and transphobia, the ableism and thexenophobia, the discrimination and the bigotry that continue to plague thissociety? Who has been denied the possibility of being among “us,” insteadbranded as “them”?  If I believe in a broader, more expansive, moreinclusive “we” and “us,” I also have to reckon with the reality that nearly 70million Americans voted the other way. For one reason or a dozen others, theyfelt that a continuation of this regime would be right and good, or at leastmore right and more good than the alternative. Even as I believe love compels meto prioritize listening to those to whom this administration has not listened,it also urges me to empathize with those who felt stronger and more secureunder its rule. And though it has so frequently deployed shame anddehumanization, I have to resist the temptation to do the same. Saturday, November7th                   HappyElection Day Part V! I always put toomany ingredients in my omelets. This one was bigger than my head! I ate half ofit.Iwas getting ready to go to the grocery store, but I was worried that the folksthere might think my red eyes were because I was upset about the electionresults. On the contrary, I spent much of the day in a state of happy tears. As I said above, I’m relievedand anxious. There’s so much work ahead. And so much potential for chaos.

Instead, you get this, from Dr. M: If you have ever muttered thephrase, \"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but whips and chains exciteme,\" you might be a baseball fan! October is the cruelest month, by far,and those of us who endure the long seasons year after year are masochists. Theshortness of this season only meant that there was more opportunity to make adeep run, and the Braves did! But alack, not deep enough to satisfy those of uswho have waited 21 years for such an opportunity. I am absolutely certain thata riding crop session in Mistress Elvira's dungeon would have been far lesspainful than watching the Braves lose three straight games and fall short ofthe World Series this week. My only consolation is that I have some dearDodgers fans who are elated that their team does not have to feel this painagain this season.Tomix metaphors, those of us who worship in the House of Baseball also dwell inthe depths of Sheol. There is the bliss of Cody Bellinger's October Blastcoupled with his now dislocated shoulder due to excess celebration. There isthe bliss of Dansby Swanson's homer coupled with a tumble into the Pit ofDespair that resulted from his inexplicable baserunning error. There is thebliss of the Dodgers in the Series, and the agony of Nick Markakis coming so closeonly to fall short yet again. So it goes, year after year. Thrill of victory,agony of defeat, year after year after year. The pain is over for me foranother season, but I will always wonder what might have happened had Dansbysimply stayed put on third. Perhaps two useless outs made in other ways,perhaps not.

Imight hit my (rather modest) book goal this year after all.1. No Fixed Line (KateShugak #22), by Dana Stabenow. ★★★★★ It is New Year’s Eve, nearly six weeks into an off-and-onblizzard that has locked Alaska down, effectively cutting it off from theoutside world. But now there are reports of a plane down in the Quilakmountains. With the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board — responsiblefor investigating aviation incidents) unable to reach the crash site,ex-Trooper Jim Chopin is pulled out of retirement to try to identify theaircraft, collect the corpses, and determine why no flight has been reportedmissing. But there are survivors: two children who don’t speak a word ofEnglish. Meanwhile, PI Kate Shugak receives an unexpected and unwelcomeaccusation from beyond the grave, a charge that could change the face of thePark forever.The Bug Says: Thatdescription (which I modified slightly due to some inaccuracies) is overlydramatic and flowery, but the book itself is absolutely fabulous andsatisfactory. I love this series and am always excited when a new book comesout. Kate is such a badass and that is my favorite kind of main character. Ifyou like murder mysteries, even if you don’t really care about Alaska, youshould definitely check this series out.2. How to be anAntiracist, by Ibram X. Kendi. ★★★★★ Kendi's concept of antiracism reenergizes andreshapes the conversation about racial justice in America--but even morefundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselvesand each other. In How to be an Antiracist, Kendi asks us to thinkabout what an antiracist society might look like, and how we can play an activerole in building it. In this book, Kendi weaves together an electrifyingcombination of ethics, history, law, and science, bringing it all together withan engaging personal narrative of his own awakening to antiracism. Howto Be an Antiracist is an essential work for anyone who wants to gobeyond an awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formationof a truly just and equitable society. The Bug Says: This bookblew my mind – the way he talks about what being antiracist looks like. It ismore about changing policies than the behavior of individual people (although thatwould also be a good start). I really like how the book was organized, and howhe wove the themes of his own life and his research into a cohesive narrative.Highly recommend! (Note: there are several offshoots from this book that mightalso be worth checking out. Here isa link to his Goodreads page if you want to see what else he has written.)3. TheUnhoneymooners, by Christina Lauren. ★★★★ Olive is always unlucky: in her career, inlove, in…well, everything. Her identical twin sister Ami, on the other hand, isprobably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiancé issomething out of a romantic comedy (gag) and she’s managed to finance herentire wedding by winning a series of Internet contests (double gag). Worst ofall, she’s forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who justhappens to be the best man.Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hellbefore she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entirewedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only peoplewho aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. And now there’s an all-expenses-paidhoneymoon in Hawaii up for grabs.Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a freevacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other atall costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie shetells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan nowhave to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. Butthe weird thing is that she doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, she feelskind of... lucky.The Bug Says: I was goingto say that this was pure fluff, but actually the writing was really clever andthe characters were not annoying (trust me, this is high praise, coming fromme). I enjoyed it a lot. If you need a break from real life, this one would bequite enjoyable.4. The Secret Lifeof Bees, by Sue Monk Kidd. ★★★★★ Set in South Carolina in 1964, The Secret Life ofBees tells the storyof Lily Owens, whose life has been shaped around the blurred memory of theafternoon her mother was killed. When Lily's fierce-hearted black\"stand-in mother,\" Rosaleen, insults three of the deepest racists intown, Lily decides to spring them both free. They escape to Tiburon, SouthCarolina--a town that holds the secret to her mother's past. Taken in by aneccentric trio of black beekeeping sisters, Lily is introduced to theirmesmerizing world of bees and honey, and the Black Madonna. This is aremarkable novel about divine female power, a story that women will share andpass on to their daughters for years to come.The Bug Says: I don’tknow how I missed reading this book when it first came out, but thank you to mycousin Kim who told me that I would love it. She was right! Such a good book!And it seems very timely, with its themes of racism and female power. Love loveloved it!5. The K Team (TheK Team #1), by David Rosenfelt. ★★★ In David Rosenfelt's newest series - a spinoffof the much beloved Andy Carpenter mysteries - Andy's wife forms aninvestigative team with a former detective and his German shepherd partner. Laurie, was a cop, a good one. Now she helps out on Andy'scases while also raising Ricky, their son. But she's been chafing to jump backinto investigating on her own, and when her former partner and his German shepherdK-9 partner come to her with a proposal, she's in.The Bug Says: I loveRosenfelt’s Andy Carpenter series, so I was excited to check out this new one.The story was good, and I really like the concept. But some of the themes wereannoying, and there seemed to be a lot of repetition along those lines. AndAndy is my favorite character of this crew, and since he wasn’t as prevalent inthis book I missed him. But will I read the next book? Heck yeah – I enjoyRosenfelt’s brand of self-deprecating snark.I had three books by favorite authors get published in September, so I’ve beentrying to read even more lately. I’ve finished one book (Armand Gamache), andwill finish a second one this weekend (Eve Dallas), and then I’ll be on to thethird one (Harry Dresden). It’s a happy time in Bug Book Land right now. Areyou reading anything interesting?"},

To be fair, he laboured mightily alongside his workers, braving the heat and elements despite his innate vulnerability to the local climate. Castle complete, he rested in the shade and admired its beauty. Alack, he had not counted on the Saline Horde's will to obliterate all such strongholds within its reach.

I’m sure most of you feelthe same way.Dr. M took over 300 pictures,but I used amazing restraint inselecting the photos for this post. If you’d like to check out all of hisphotos, you can find him as @ridinthestormout59 on Instagram. Also, as you already know, I did a Wordless Wednesday with beach pics (and some of the decor from our condo). Finally, I am going to do one more beach post - a Tale of Woe (those of you who follow Dr. M on FB have already seen this). Sunday, September 13th We left home at around 11:00& got to the beach around 3:15 – not a bad drive! These photos are as wewere driving over the causeway into Ocean Isle. Monday, September14th Today was a rest day. Oh whoam I kidding – they were all restdays. We barely moved all week. I did get down to the beach for a brief walk and tookthis photo of the condo where we were staying. Dr. M got photos of the dunearea beneath our balcony. It was a constant source of entertainment – crab,beach mice, a fox (you’ll see it’s picture later), and lots of birds. Tuesday, September15thScenes from our balcony. Idid venture out to get pizza for dinner.Wednesday, September16h                                                           Breakfast (oatmeal, egg,cheese, mushrooms, broccoli, zucchini, & cilantro)! Actually, that wassecond breakfast. First breakfast was part of a huge mango, a nectarine, and aslice of leftover pizza. I took another walk on thebeach & noticed that the steps on most of the boardwalks were new. And thenI noticed this one that had not been repaired. This area was hard hit by astorm in recent memory, but looks fine now. Thursday, September17th         Mydad’s birthday! I talked to him in the morning & he had received over 40cards at that time. I’ll see him tomorrow and check them all out. Hereare more photos from the balcony. If you look closely at the one with the dogin it, there is a little dot that is two tiny dogs. I saw their owner walkingthem all the day before & it was hilarious to see that giant dog with itslittle sidekicks.Friday, September18th Dr. M was up early and got these excellent photos ofthe fox! So beautiful! We drove home, and someone was really glad that hisbuddy was home. The Roy is a mess.Saturday, September19th                 HurricaneSally’s rain band meant that we arrived home to a very lush yard. It made ussmile to see all the flower activity. We were talking about how wehad packed for “before.” Dr. M packed slacks & nice shirts, and I tookthree cute outfits and didn’t even glance at them, because I didn’t go shoppingand we definitely didn’t eat in a restaurant! I brought them right back home& had to fluff them in the dryer because I got them wrinkled. The onlyreason I didn’t wear the same pair of shorts & t-shirt for the whole weekwas just simple habit. I switched them out mid-week. I’m sure Dr. M appreciatedit, but I don’t think it was necessary. It was really nice to not feel like wehad to go anywhere or do anything. I highly recommend it!

{"title": "Book Reviews – the August Edition", "date": "Wednesday, September 9, 2020", "text": "Once again, I only have three books toreview this month. I’ve been rereading a fluffy Nora Roberts series (one of herwitchy trilogies – the perfect diversion from current events). Next month will probablybe more of the same.  1. PeaceTalks (The Dresden Files #16) by Jim Butcher. ★★★★★ When the Supernatural nations of the world meetup to negotiate an end to ongoing hostilities, Harry Dresden, Chicago's onlyprofessional wizard, joins the White Council's security team to make sure thetalks stay civil. But can he succeed, when dark political manipulationsthreaten the very existence of Chicago--and all he holds dear?TheBug Says: AsI’ve mentioned elsewhere, we waited 6 years for this next book in the Dresdenseries. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It felt like a return to similar plot linesfrom some of the older books which was a lot of fun, to me. But the best (andworst) part is that it was basically a book to set up the next one, which comesout at the end of this month. Woot!2. Betweenthe World and Me, by Ta-Nehisi Coates. ★★★★★ In a profound work that pivots from the biggestquestions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of afather for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework forunderstanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built anempire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls mostheavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slaveryand segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of allproportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to livewithin it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history andfree ourselves from its burden? Betweenthe World and Me is Ta-NehisiCoates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son.Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truthabout his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, fromHoward University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago toParis, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’slives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative,reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminatesthe past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision fora way forward.TheBug Says: Thiswas such a good book – especially for someone like I am, who only has a cursoryidea of what it’s like to be a Black man in today’s world. And the premise –that it’s a letter to his son – makes it so poignant. I finished the bookwanting more than ever to do a better job of helping create anti-racistpolicies.3. TheChilbury Ladies’ Choir, by Jennifer Ryan. ★★★★★ Kent, 1940. Inthe idyllic village of Chilbury change is afoot. Hearts are breaking as sonsand husbands leave to fight, and when the Vicar decides to close the choiruntil the men return, all seems lost. But coming together in song is just whatthe women of Chilbury need in these dark hours, and they are ready to sing.With a little fighting spirit and the arrival of a new musical resident, thecharismatic Miss Primrose Trent, the choir is reborn. Some see the choir as achance to forget their troubles, others the chance to shine. Though for onevillager, the choir is the perfect cover to destroy Chilbury’s new-foundharmony.Uplifting andprofoundly moving, THE CHILBURY LADIES’ CHOIR explores how a village can endurethe onslaught of war, how monumental history affects small lives and howsurvival is as much about friendship as it is about courage.TheBug Says: Ohmy goodness what a MOST satisfactory read! It was my favorite kind of book –full of British WWII gumption, but the writing itself was a lovely surprise. Also,if you’re able to, listen to the audio version – it was great!Last month I said that would probably have finally finished Ibrim X. Kendi’sbook How to be an Antiracist, butthis is a dense book with a lot of research (and it’s long!), so I’m still onlyabout halfway through. Nevertheless I can already recommend it highly. So good,and another book that is convicting me right and left. I’ll make no promises,but really I should be done with it for my September book review."},

We’re blocking off pews,wearing masks, not singing, not hugging… I feel conflicted – a little worriedthat we’ll slip up & not be safe, but also salty that I have to leave myhouse. I’ve gotten used to staying home on Sundays! I’ll let you know how itwent.I’m going to close with someranting that I did on FB. I posted an essay from someone about systemic racism.An acquaintance started posting stories in the comments about how bad BlackLives Matter (the organization) is, and how good the police are, and how aliberal congresswoman called for unrest in the streets (like that’s a badthing). Here was my reply to her: “I'm increasingly frustrated with theresponse of 'but they did this' & 'they did that' toany discussion of systemic racism. I understand that it can be hard to graspbecause we've breathed it like air & bathed in it like water for CENTURIES.But we have to try. Because the REASON that people behave like they do isembedded in the structures that have privileged white people. Stop looking atwhat they're doing & try to figure out why. And then work to make changes.Because unrest is going to be there until we fix it.” Then she posted ANOTHERstory saying that all lives matter. So I said this, “…you continue to miss thepoint. I DON'T CARE what people are doing in this particular instance. WHAT AREWE DOING to fix the system that is causing the unrest? It's like telling yourchild to keep quiet when they try to explain what hurts, as if it will just goaway if they shut up.” That was WAY out of mycomfort zone. So basically I need to hide under a rock for a few days. I’ll seeyou guys next week!"},

Saturday, August 22nd                 Your weekly progress photo.I don’t know if I’ll be able to post another one next week – it’s taking longerto make my way around the edges now. Well, I guess I could post one even if it’sonly partway done. I’m not the boss of me! Wait…I’ve had a good weekend. Gotthe house cleaned yesterday & all the laundry done. Played on my iPad.Crocheted. The Braves won. Saw my dad & Sue briefly today (she’s havingback surgery next Friday, so good thoughts please!). How was your weekend?"},

I used theXyzal for exactly two days and decided that being alert was more important thanbeing able to talk. And frankly my voice has been mostly fine lately. I wonderwhat I’ll complain about next week? The attack on the US postal service? Thegeneral misogyny in all areas of human life? The fact that evangelicalChristians continue to bray about being persecuted and (apparently) think that  the current president will save them? (Funfact: neither of these is true.)Sunday, August 9th                                                               That’s a lot of containersof food for Monday! You’ll be relieved to know that I ate half of everything(oatmeal, fruit, salad). So then I didn’t have to pack Tuesday’s lunch. Woot!Monday, August 10th                           Our wildflower bed isbattered, but still contains some gems. Tuesday, August 11th                                                                 Pulled this back out to workon. Wednesday, August 12th                                                         Met a friend for lunch. I had already eaten by the time she said she was going to be in the area, but Iam never too full for dessert!Thursday, August 13th       I wear my glasses on top ofmy head until I get into the office & then (usually), I put them on myface. Something went awry here.Friday, August 14th                                                                     Good hair day. I posted on the socials: There’s something not quiteright here, but I can’t put my finger on it. Can one of you help?Dr. M found some rather large tomatoes!Saturday, August 15th                Progress photo on theproject, plus the introduction of a fun new color! I’m not sure what I’ll thinkabout the end result, but I’m very much enjoying the process of making it.Last week Steve Reed asked who Otis theSheepadoodle is. He’s a dog we follow on Instagram – go here if you’d like tocheck out his page. And YES Steve you should absolutely make an Olga calendar!We had a 5.1 magnitudeearthquake on Sunday morning. I was asleep, but I felt our house move and I rememberwaking up briefly & wondering what the heck Dr. M was doing that would shakethe whole house, & then I rolled over & went back to sleep.

{"title": "Book Reviews – the July Edition", "date": "Wednesday, August 12, 2020", "text": "I only have three books to review thismonth. One reason is that one of the books from my June post was actually finishedin July. Oops. The other reason is that I listened to a LOT of podcasts inJuly! Maybe I’ll do a post about those sometime (hint – Brene’ Brown, JenHatmaker, and The Evolving Faith podcast feature).1. I'mStill Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness,by Austin Channing Brown. ★★★★★ AustinChanning Brown's first encounter with a racialized America came at age 7, whenshe discovered her parents named her Austin to deceive future employers intothinking she was a white man. Growing up in majority-white schools,organizations, and churches, Austin writes, \"I had to learn what it meansto love blackness,\" a journey that led to a lifetime spent navigatingAmerica's racial divide as a writer, speaker and expert who helps organizationspractice genuine inclusion.In a time when nearly all institutions (schools, churches, universities,businesses) claim to value \"diversity\" in their missionstatements, I'm Still Here is a powerful account of how and why ouractions so often fall short of our words. Austin writes in breathtaking detailabout her journey to self-worth and the pitfalls that kill our attempts atracial justice, in stories that bear witness to the complexity of America'ssocial fabric--from Black Cleveland neighborhoods to private schools in themiddle-class suburbs, from prison walls to the boardrooms at majority-whiteorganizations.For readers who have engaged with America's legacy on race through the writingof Ta-Nehisi Coates and Michael Eric Dyson, I'm Still Here is anilluminating look at how white, middle-class, Evangelicalism has participatedin an era of rising racial hostility, inviting the reader to confront apathy,recognize God's ongoing work in the world, and discover how blackness--if welet it--can save us all.TheBug Says: Ohman, what a powerful book. There are so many ways that Black women have to playa role just to exist in corporate America (and yes, I’m including Christianorganizations in this). It must be exhausting. This book does a great job ofshowing just what that looks like and why our standard “solutions” are no solutionat all.2. TheOne-in-a-Million Boy, by Monica Wood. ★★★★★ “The story of your life never startsat the beginning. Don't they teach you anything at school?” So says104-year-old Ona to the 11-year-old boy who's been sent to help her out everySaturday morning. As he refills the bird feeders and tidies the garden shed,Ona tells him about her long life, from first love to second chances. Soonshe's confessing secrets she has kept hidden for decades.One Saturday, the boy doesn't show up. Ona starts to think he's not so specialafter all, but then his father arrives on her doorstep, determined to finishhis son's good deed. The boy's mother is not so far behind. Ona is set todiscover that the world can surprise us at any age, and that sometimes sharinga loss is the only way to find ourselves again. TheBug Says: Iloved this book! It was another bookclub book (read during the actual month that I was supposed to read it). Itengaged me from the very beginning. I was fascinated by Ona and the mystery ofthe boy. It’s a lovely story of grief and redemption. READ IT! (Or not, I’m notthe boss of you.)3. Muzzled,(Andy Carpenter #21) by David Rosenfelt. ★★★★Andy Carpenter is a lawyer who would rather notpractice law. He'd rather spend his time working with the Tara Foundation, hisdog rescue organization, and being with his family and his two dogs, Tara andSebastian. But when a friend asks him for a favor that involves both dogs andhis lawyerly expertise, he can't say no.Andy's friend Beth has found a stray that seems to havebelonged to a murder victim--in fact, the man and two of his colleagues died inan explosion a few weeks ago. But when the murdered man contacts Beth, askingfor his dog back, Andy knows there must be more to the story. The man claims hislife is in danger, and that's why he disappeared. As much as Andy doesn't wantto get involved--anything to avoid a new case--he can't help but come to therescue of a man who'd risk everything, even his life, to reunite with his dog.TheBug Says: Thisis one of my favorite books series. The main character is hilarious and themysteries are usually very engaging. I’ve only ever listened to the audiobooksfor this series (the narrator is really good), but I actually won this one in aGoodreads giveaway so I read the paperback. The story was just as fun andinteresting as always, but oh my goodness there were a lot of typos and thingsthat an editor should catch. I had no idea that the books were so sloppy – the narratordoes a great job of cleaning that stuff up. Or this was just unusual. I don’tknow – but it certainly won’t stop me from reading book #22. I finished my Harry Dresden book yesterday (no spoilers!), and I’m currently readingTa-Nehisi Coates’ book Between the Worldand Me, and Ibram X. Kendi’s book Howto be an Antiracist. I’ve been reading the Kendi book for a couple ofmonths – I bought it, but kept having library books become available so I wouldput it aside to read them. Now there’s nothing else on my shelf so I shouldhave it on my August list next month. What have you been reading lately?"},

Did youguys notice that last week I called the morning glory a petunia? I kept meaningto go back & fix it, but at this point it’s just going to stay wrong.I needed to sew something (Ihad a couple of masks that were too big, so I was sewing the ear bands closed alittle tighter), and I pulled out my ancient sewing kit. I noticed this metalgadget that I hadn’t paid attention to before & was googling it to see whatthe heck it is, but Dr. M was faster. It’s a bodkin, which you can use to pull drawstrings or elastic through clothes. I used it to hold the elastic bands together so I could sew. Does it feel like the worldis just getting crazier and crazier? I mean, we do have an awful lot going on,and now we have to worry about the post office on top of everything else. Ireally hope that we can overcome all the things, elect some decent folks in November, and thensurvive until January.

There was a LOT in there! (Yes, I’m awarethat the container I chose is probably a butter keeper or some such, but lotionis sort of like butter, right?) Monday, July 27th                           There was a meme goingaround asking how old you were before you had a Black teacher. I had both of theseladies in the 9th grade. Ms. Harshaw (left) was my Freshman Englishteacher, and Ms. Setzer (right) was my homeroom & social studies teacher. Ididn’t think about it at the time, but can you even imagine what it must havebeen like for a Black woman to teach in rural North Carolina in the late70s/early 80s? Tuesday, July 28th                                                                 I had a selfie from today(meant to show how low I had slouched in my office chair), but I thought youneeded to see this instead.

But these didn’t really showcase itvery well. Saturday, August 1st                 Our Misfits box came &instead of yellow squash we got these weird looking things that are about asbig as my head! I posted on the Interwebs and about forty eleven people told methat it is jicama. Something new for Dr. M to play with!I took the beard off of thefirst gnome I made & gave it hair instead. I think I have a Mr. & Mrs.Gnome now. (I included the beard picture in case you don’t remember how weirdit looked).Yet more new masks (and Ihave another one that I haven’tphotographed yet) – from the Atlanta Braves this time. I think we really aredone buying masks now. Maybe. In case you’re concernedabout my allergy med saga, on Wednesday I started the second of the three thatmy doctor gave me to try – Allegra. I think I’ve taken this in the past? Itdoesn’t make me as drowsy as the Zyrtec did, but it does make me a little drowsy. I’ll give it the full tendays to see what I think & then I’ll try the third one – the hilariously(to me) named Xyzal. Do you have any interesting medical news to share?"},

Tuesday, July 14th                                                                I was talking to my dad abouthow it’s been fun watching all these Braves reruns – they never show a gamewhere the Braves lose.

WhenI DO wash my hair I use the sea salt spray (smells like coconut!) to let it airdry with texture. This morning I washed my hair & then accidentally spritzedaway with the body mist instead of the sea salt spray. Used WAY MORE thanusual. Then I used the sea salt spray. That extremely long explanation is justso I can say this: I smell like an over ripe tropical fruit salad today. Iwould like to formally apologize to my coworkers.Friday, July 17th                                                                     Dr. M went to see his dadand on his way home he found a field of zinnias!I posted this on Instagram& Facebook after much soulsearching and deliberation. Not because I don’t believe every word, but becauseI didn’t want to deal with any backlash. Despite having very strong opinions, Ido NOT like conflict at all. However, I really have such lovely friends – if anyof them disagreed they kept it to themselves. Gave blood on my way home.Word to the wise: don’t give blood when you’re hungry. I did fine until I waschanging clothes after I got home – almost passed out & terrified Dr. M. Saturday, July 18th                 Experiment. Things I like:cute & quick.

{"title": "Book Reviews – the June Edition", "date": "Wednesday, July 8, 2020", "text": "I apparently spent theentire month of June with my nose in a book. I read seven books! What theheck! I was spurred a little bit because I had several library books I’d waitedon forever that became available at the same time. 1. Fierce,Free, and Full of Fire: The Guide to Being Glorious You, by JenHatmaker. ★★★★★ The author says: In this book, I break it down intofive self-reflective categories—who I am, what I need, what I want, what Ibelieve, and how I connect—and by working your way through them, you will learnto: own your space, ground, and gifts (they are YOURS, sister); be strong inyour relationships and lay down passive aggression, resentment, drama, andcompliance; say GUILT-FREE what you want and what you need; and welcomespiritual curiosity and all the fantastic change that doing so creates. You with me, beloveds? Ifwe do this work on our own selves now, not only will we discover a life trulyworth living, but we will free our daughters to rise up behind us, with spinesstraight, heads up, and coated in our strength.The Bug Says: Thatdescription reads like a typical self-help book, but it doesn’t feel like one.While the writing style is worlds away from Glennon Doyle’s book, the messageis similar and just as electrifying: you are allowed to be yourself no matterwhat boxes your world erects around you. I’ve always chafed at boxes, but Ialso REALLY dislike any kind of conflict. This gave me a little boost to see ifI can break free from some of my confining spaces. 2. Hideaway,by Nora Roberts. ★★★★Caitlyn Sullivan had come from a longline of Hollywood royalty, stretching back to her Irish immigrantgreat-grandfather. At nine, she was already a star—yet still an innocent childwho loved to play hide and seek with her cousins at the family home in Big Sur.It was during one of those games that she disappeared. Some may have consideredher a pampered princess, but Cate was in fact a smart, scrappy fighter, and shemanaged to escape her abductors. Dillon Cooper was shocked to find thebloodied, exhausted girl huddled in his house—but when the teenager and hisfamily heard her story they provided refuge, reuniting her with her loved ones.Cate’s ordeal, though, was far from over. First came the discovery of ashocking betrayal that would send someone she’d trusted to prison. Then therewere years spent away in western Ireland, peaceful and protected but withrestlessness growing in her soul. Finally, she would return to Los Angeles,gathering the courage to act again and get past the trauma that had derailedher life. What she didn’t yet know was that two seeds had been planted thatlong-ago night—one of a great love, and one of a terrible vengeance.The Bug Says:This is another fine novel by one of my favorite authors. She writes the bestdialogue, and most of her heroines aren’t stupid. I hardly ever yell at them,so you know she does a good job of writing strong women. Ha!3. Necessary as Blood, (Duncan Kincaid& Gemma James #13), by Deborah Crombie ★★★★ Once the haunt ofJack the Ripper, London's East End is a vibrant mix of history and theavant-garde, where elegant Georgian town houses exist side by side withcolorful street markets and the hippest clubs. But here races and culturesstill clash, and the trendy galleries and glamorous nightlife of Whitechapeldisguise a violent and seedy underside, where unthinkable crimes bring terrorto the innocent.On a beautiful Sunday afternoon in mid May, a young mother, Sandra Gilles,leaves her daughter with a friend at the Columbia Road Flower Market anddisappears. A few months later, her husband, a Pakistani lawyer, is killed.The Bug Says: Ilove this series (obviously, since I’m on book 13). This is no cozy Britishmystery, but even so there is something comforting about reading a ScotlandYard murder mystery. Maybe it’s because I listened to the audiobook and I love theBritish accent? (This is also true of the next book, although it’s set in theLondon of the WWII blitz instead of present day).4. TheAmerican Agent, (Maisie Dobbs #15) by Jacqueline Winspear. ★★★★ Belovedheroine Maisie Dobbs, “one of the great fictional heroines” (Parade),investigates the mysterious murder of an American war correspondent in Londonduring the Blitz in a page-turning tale of love and war, terror and survival.As the Germans unleash the full terror of their blitzkrieg upon the BritishIsles, raining death and destruction from the skies, Maisie must balance thedemands of solving this dangerous case with her need to protect Anna, the youngevacuee she has grown to love and wants to adopt. Entangled in an investigationlinked to the power of wartime propaganda and American political intrigue beingplayed out in Britain, Maisie will face losing her dearest friend—and thepossibility that she might be falling in love again.The Bug Says: Thisis another series that I love. She reminds me a bit of Sherlock Holmes becauseshe gathers all kinds of seemingly innocuous information & then uses it inthe end to find the killer (or rather, usually she’s just naming the killer whohas been there all along). This one was just as interesting as the previousones. And I really had no idea until the end whodunit! 5. TheDaughters of Erietown, by Connie Schultz. ★★★★ Hiddendesires and long-held secrets, the sacrifices people make for family and torealize their dreams, are at the heart of this powerful first novel aboutworking class people in a small town. By the popular Pulitzer Prize-winningjournalist.In the 1950s, Ellie and Brick are teenagers in love. As a basketball star,Brick has the chance to escape his abusive father and become the first personin his blue-collar family to attend college. But after Ellie learns that she ispregnant, they get married, she gives up her dream of nursing school, and Brickgets a union card instead.This riveting novel tells the story of Brick, Ellie, and their daughterSamantha, as the frustrations of unmet desire for sex, love, identity, andmeaningful work explode their lives. The evolution of women's lives overdecades of the second half of the 20th century is explored, in a story thatrichly portrays how much people know about each other and pretend not to--thesecrets at the heart of a family. The Bug Says: Iread this book because I follow Connie Schultz on Facebook. She is an awardwinning journalist who lives in Cleveland, but she’s also the wife of SenatorSherrod Brown. I was prepared to be kind while reading it, but it is actually avery good book! I don’t often willingly read novels about generations offamilies (see British mysteries, above), but this one was engaging and left me afterwordwondering how Sam was doing. I missed her & Ellie! I highly recommendpicking this one up!6. TheSilent Patient, by Alex Michaelides. ★★★ Promisingto be the debut novel of the season, The Silent Patient isa shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against herhusband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive…Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to anin-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windowsoverlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening herhusband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots himfive times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for theopportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk andunravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting pathinto his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consumehim...The Bug Says: Igot very behind on book club books. Ithink this was the book for May? It’s because I didn’t want to purchase thebook (and the next one, below), so I had to wait until they were available atthe library. This book was pretty good. The writing style sort of reminded meof somebody reading someone else’s notes from the file. Kind of dry? I don’tknow – it was hard for me to get into it in the beginning, but it did pick upmomentum, and there is a twist at the end that had me reflexively giving it 4stars. Such a great twist! But in the end I backed it down because of how hardit was for me to stay engaged until the last third of the book. HOWEVER, Istill recommend that you read it & tell me what you thought of the end.7. NoExit, by Taylor Adams. ★★★ A brilliant, edgythriller about four strangers, a blizzard, a kidnapped child, and a determinedyoung woman desperate to unmask and outwit a vicious psychopath.On her way to Utah to see her dying mother, college student Darby Thorne getscaught in a fierce blizzard in the mountains of Colorado. With the roadsimpassable, she’s forced to wait out the storm at a remote highway rest stop.Inside, are some vending machines, a coffee maker, and four complete strangers.Desperate to find a signal to call home, Darby goes back out into the storm . .. and makes a horrifying discovery. In the back of the van parked next to hercar, a little girl is locked in an animal crate.There is no cell phone reception, no telephone, and no way out. One of herfellow travelers is a kidnapper. But which one?The Bug Says: Thisis another one where I wavered between a 3 and a 4. It was a romp to read (in agory, sadistic, evil villain matching wits with an intrepid heroine sort ofway), but there were so many little things that drove me crazy (whose iPhone hoversat less than 10% power for that many hours?). Also, by the end, I was like, come on – another plot twist? However,it was fast paced and very satisfactory despite the fact that not all of thegood guys lived.  On my shelf now: TheOne-in-a-Million Boy, by Monica Wood and I'm Still Here: Black Dignity in aWorld Made for Whiteness, by Austin Channing Brown. They are bothexcellent and I already know I’m going to want to recommend them to you. Whatare you reading?"},

The spacing is weird, I have to add pictures oneat a dang time (I used to upload them all, and then just insert them where Iwanted), and I can’t just type inthe labels anymore – I have to scroll through the whole list to find the ones Iwant. I have a jillion labels. Labels might be a thing of the past (I mostlyuse the search feature when I’m trying to find a post anyway). Okay, rant over.For now. Sunday, June 28th                                                            Dr. M spent some time withhis dad & the hydrangeas that are from his mother’s funeral. I spent some time with mydad and Sue, and picked some blueberries. When I commented that the thing onthe right was NOT a blueberry, my dad yanked it up & sent it home with me(garlic – yum!).Monday, June 29th                           The moon! Tuesday, June 30th                                                                Another day, another masksituation. Our neighbor’s daylilies arelovely! Wednesday, July 1st                                                        I posted this about beingglad my new curling iron came with that warning, and then things took a bawdyturn – especially after I read the instructions. And all I can say about that isOUCH.  Thursday, July 2nd      One of my coworkers’husbands brought us patriotic donuts. Yum! That evening we had avisitation from the blissed out Roy. Friday, July 3rd                                                                    I had the day off from work –woo hoo! I finished up this project – another non-sock item made from sock yarnthat I’d had for about 5 years. I actually mostly finished it a couple of weeks ago,but I was POSITIVE I had another skein of the yarn in the house somewhere. Idid another pretty exhaustive search on this day & had no luck. It’s fine –this is supposed to be a scarf, not a shawl anyway. Photo shoot to come afterit dries. Saturday, July 4th                 We spent part of the daywith Dr. M’s dad. We had bbq & baked beans with fried okra (I don’t knowwhy the only picture I took of that was the okra). And then we had cupcakes,which I thoroughly enjoyed. Dr. M spent some time talking with his dad & Ispent some time picking blueberries. I think it’s fitting that I began andended the week with blueberries! I often have a lot ofconflicting feelings about this day, but this year it was more troubling thanusual. I’ll let Frederick Douglass explain (and my goodness, I read analternate opinion of him this week & now I’m giving him side eye!). I’ve had a lovely longweekend, but I don’t mind going back to work (at least I won’t mind once I’m upand out of the shower – pre-shower I will be a little salty about it). When I’mout of my routine I can spiral down into complete lethargy with a touch ofdepression. I did get some housework done, so I feel good about that, and Ifinished a couple of books and started on THREE more. But I’ll bet my screentime was through the roof! What did you do with your down time? (If you had some– and I don’t want to hear it from my retired people – I’m looking at youDaddy.)"},

The big wildflower bed on the other hand – not very delicateat all!I am about at my wits endtrying to figure out why people are so belligerent about wearing masks. Itmakes no sense. It reminds me of the O Brother Where Art there Quote: “It’s afool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart.” Ah well, I’lljust keep wearing my mask and waiting for a vaccine.

{"title": "Book Reviews - the May Edition", "date": "Wednesday, June 10, 2020", "text": "Last month I only had 3books to review, but I made up for it this month. I read 5 books! Once againthere was a nice mixed bag of just ok and fabulous. 1. Untamed,by Glennon Doyle. ★★★★★There is a voice oflonging inside every woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good mothers,daughters, partners, employees, citizens, and friends. We believe all thisstriving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck,overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives, relationships, and world,and wonder: Wasn’t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? Wequickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful. We hide oursimmering discontent—even from ourselves. Until we reach our boiling point.Four years ago, Glennon Doyle—bestselling Oprah-endorsed author, renownedactivist and humanitarian, wife and mother of three—was speaking at aconference when a woman (Abby Wambach) entered the room. Glennon looked at herand fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is.… Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is botha memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It offers a piercing, electrifyingexamination of the restrictive expectations women are issued from birth; showshow hustling to meet those expectations leaves women feeling dissatisfied andlost; and reveals that when we quit abandoning ourselves and instead abandonthe world’s expectations of us, we become women who can finally look atourselves and recognize: There She Is.The Bug Says: Ohman is this a GOOD book! Each chapter is a little kick to the gut (in a goodway). Some are vignettes from her life and others are discussions with us abouthow to become true to ourselves. I highly recommend it. 2. The GreatAlone, by Kristin Hannah. ★★★ Alaska, 1974. Unpredictable. Unforgiving.Untamed. For a family in crisis, the ultimate test of survival. Ernt Allbright,a former POW, comes home from the Vietnam war a changed and volatile man. Whenhe loses yet another job, he makes an impulsive decision: he will move hisfamily north, to Alaska, where they will live off the grid in America’s lasttrue frontier.At first, Alaska seems to be the answer to their prayers. But as winterapproaches and darkness descends on Alaska, Ernt’s fragile mental statedeteriorates and the family begins to fracture. Soon the perils outside pale incomparison to threats from within. In their small cabin, covered in snow,blanketed in eighteen hours of night, Leni and her mother learn the terribletruth: they are on their own. In the wild, there is no one to save them butthemselves. The Bug Says:I loved Kristin Hannah’s The Nightingale, so I was excited toread this book. But oh my goodness – it was like she thought of every possiblestereotypical thing that could happened to a family & just threw it alltogether to see what would happen. Every chapter contained something that wouldhave been the denouement in any otherbook, and yet this one just kept going. The ending was somewhat satisfactory(in an ABC Afterschool Special kind of way). 3. ReadyPlayer One, by Ernest Cline. ★★★★ IN THE YEAR 2044,reality is an ugly place. The only time teenage Wade Watts really feelsalive is when he's jacked into the virtual utopia known as the OASIS. Wade'sdevoted his life to studying the puzzles hidden within this world's digitalconfines, puzzles that are based on their creator's obsession with the popculture of decades past and that promise massive power and fortune to whoevercan unlock them.But when Wade stumbles upon the first clue, he finds himself beset by playerswilling to kill to take this ultimate prize. The race is on, and if Wade'sgoing to survive, he'll have to win—and confront the real world he's alwaysbeen so desperate to escape.The Bug Says: Thiswas a lot of fun to “read” (I listened to the audiobook, narrated by WesleyCrusher Wil Wheaton). There was a LOT of 80s trivia. And there was a verysatisfactory rebellion against a corporate giant. Apparently a movie was made(the book came out in 2011) – I haven’t looked to see if it’s any good, but Imight have to check it out.4. TheDeep, by Alma Katsu. ★★★Someone, or something, is hauntingthe ship. That is the only way to explain the series of misfortunes that haveplagued the passengers of the Titanic from the moment they set sail. While someof the guests and crew shrug off strange occurrences, several--including maidAnnie Hebbley, guest Mark Fletcher, and millionaires Madeleine Astor andBenjamin Guggenheim--are convinced there's something more sinister going on.And then disaster strikes. Years later, Annie, having survived that fateful night, has attempted to puther life back together by going to work as a nurse on the sixth sailing ofthe Britannic, newly refitted as a hospital ship to support British forcesfighting World War I. When she happens across an unconscious Mark, now asoldier, she is at first thrilled and relieved to learn that he too survivedthe tragic night four years earlier. But soon his presence awakens deep-buriedfeelings and secrets, forcing her to reckon with the demons of her past--asthey both discover that the terror may not yet be over.Featuring an ensemble cast of characters and effortlessly combining thesupernatural with the height of historical disaster, The Deep is anexploration of love and destiny, desire and innocence, and, above all, a questto understand how our choices can lead us inexorably toward our doom. The Bug Says: Thiswas a very interesting twist on the Titanic story, and I really enjoyed all thename dropping of famous passengers (I kept looking them up to see if theysurvived). But for some reason it just fell flat for me. This is a case where Iactually think this would work better as a movie. 5. AgathaRaisin and the Potted Gardener (Agatha Raisin #3), by M.C. Beaton. ★★★★ AgathaRaisin has a crush on James Lacey. In order to endear herself to him, she takesup gardening, hoping to participate with him in the prestigious CarselyHorticultural Contest. But as the contest approaches, plants are beingmysteriously uprooted, poisoned, and burned. When the prime suspect turns updead, Agatha must solve the murder mystery.The Bug Says: Iloved the first book in this series, but the second book was meh. This one wasa lot better than the second one – mostly because despite that first sentencein the description, Agatha spent most of the book not having a crush on James Lacey. (I was heartily sick of hercrush in the second book.) This is lighthearted English murder mystery fun. Just today I finished aJen Hatmaker book (5 stars), started a Nora Roberts novel, and am in the middleof a British murder mystery (the 13th in a series). Also, on my listto read: Be the Bridge:Pursuing God's Heart for Racial Reconciliation,by LaTasha Morrison, and How to Be an Antiracist, by Ibram X. Kendi. What are you reading?"},

Maybe I’m delusional. That doesn’t meanthat I don’t intend to continue to do the work to help dismantle racism (once Ifigure out what my piece of that work is).  For now, let’s see what else happened thisweek. For example, this is the week that I finished the blanket I’ve beenworking on. I was about to say that now you will have seen the end of it, but Itook pictures of it today in its new home, so you’ll see those next week.Sunday,May 31st                                                           I love this picture of Peaches the Rose – you can see allthe different stages of her flowers, from peach bud to blowsy lady.I called this the Banana Bread of Doom. I accidentally used ¾tablespoon of salt instead of ¾ teaspoon. You wouldn’t think it wouldmake that much of a difference, but reader: it does. I made some caramel saucelater in the week to see if I could trick myself into thinking I was eatingsome sort of salted caramel dessert, but it only sort of worked. THE LAST SQUARE (of this particular blanket). Monday,June 1st                          Daylily at Dr. M’s dad’s house. Tuesday,June 2nd                                                               Salad in a jar. It had leftover homemade pulled chicken bbqin it and it was GOOD. Wednesday,June 3rd                                                         I took just a few grapes to work for a snack. Heh.We have these very interesting flowers growing by thebuilding I work in. What are they?Dr. M grilled some corn so we could have Mexican street cornagain. It’s my new favorite thing.Thursday,June 4th       We haven’t really been wearing masks at work – just tryingto not be in each other’s space. But, my office is kind of small, and when Imeet with employees I have to spend time closer than 6 feet (especially if we’regoing over paperwork), so I decided that I needed to be a better citizen bywearing a mask. Friday,June 5th                                                                    Time to add all of these squares to this monster!Both geraniums are now blooming and seem to be very happyout on the deck. Saturday,June 6th                 Ta da! I really struggled to get a good picture (the blanket is almost 7.5 feet square). I’mincluding the video because I think it does a little better job. The recipients(Daddy & Sue) seemed VERY appreciative when I delivered it today. It was areally fun project, but I’m glad to get it out of our living room. Ha! People keep asking how long it took to make. It's hard to tell because the original 24 squares were done over the course of a year (a new pattern was released every two weeks). But I estimate that I spent about 3-4 hours on each of the 36 squares. The joining itself didn't take that long, but maybe add another 2-3 hours for that? So, somewhere in the (very broad) range of 100 to 150 hours?Our Mistfits box had an English cucumber in it today, so Dr.M made cucumber tomato salad. It was really yummy!I am getting ready to work on my May book review post, butexpect that I might post some more information about the Black Lives movementat some point. Dr. M has been doing some good writing on Facebook, so I mightsteal from him. Something for you guys to look forward to!"},
{"title": "They Just Want to Live", "date": "Tuesday, June 2, 2020", "text": "I was going to write a post about the George Floyd, but this video and these words from the interim pastor of my church say everything that I'm feeling. Dr. M has also been very eloquent - maybe I'll do another post later with some of his thoughts.Howard Thurman asks us a damning questionin his book “Jesus and the Disinherited: “Why is it that Christianityseems impotent to deal radically, and therefore effectively, with the issues ofdiscrimination and injustice on the basis of race, religion and nationalorigin?”  We have personalizedracism saying “I don’t have a racist bone in my body” when it is a systemicproblem far more than a personal attitude.  When Social Security wascalled for by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he bent to the will of the Southwho wanted their farm laborers and domestic help to remain exempt from theprogram so those in power (uniformly white people) could save money at theexpense of their black servants and laborers. Blacks returning from WW2 couldnot always get the same GI bill housing benefits and colleges were stillallowed to refuse admittance to African Americans so an advanced education wasagain often denied. We see the ongoing segregation in our all too unequalschools. White people havesystemically had their foot on the necks of African Americans.  When apolice officer in Minneapolis kept his knee on George Floyd’s neck for ninelong minutes as he choked to death, it is no surprise that anger and violencehas erupted. From afar, both physically and experientially, we white folkare put off by the vandalism and destruction that has followed and wonder whythe anger is so intense.Frederick Douglassoffered this explanation in 1886:“Where justice isdenied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails and where any oneclass is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, roband degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.” The black citizens ofMinneapolis (and Charlotte and Hickory and Los Angeles) have seen the failureof our policing system one more time when all four officers ignore the pleadingof a dying man and a crowd of witnesses.  They doubt the justice systemwill serve them any better. This week we celebratePentecost Sunday and read from Acts 2 which celebrates a diverse gathering ofpeople from around the world. The Spirit offers us a greater challengethan we have typically embraced. Our personal behavior alwaysmatters.  But what matters even more in the search for justice is that weoverturn the temple tables and begin to rebuild our societal and politicalstructures so that “the least of these” are no longer trampled underfoot.~ breathing in sorrow,Nancy"},

Miss Rita & Ms. Pinky are doing quite well these days! Ms. Pinky has about a bazillion buds justwaiting to pop.The Roy!Two more squares – finished the one on the right (the one I was working on on Wednesday), and then startedanother one right away. It went really fast!Along with racial upheaval, the COVID cases in our area justkeep going up.

This year we celebrated #88 with my dadand he had a great day! [Notefrom the Bug: That was some reallygood cake!]Remember how last week I said I was thinking about gettinggroceries for the first time since March? And that I would tell you all aboutit? Well, here you go: all of the staff were wearing masks, but there was only oneother customer wearing one. I got everything on my list & a bonus pint ofBen & Jerry’s as a reward. It wasn’t that bad – I think I’m getting used towearing a mask in public now. Nevertheless, I wasn’t sad when Dr. M said thathe would go to the store today. I have the day off from work tomorrow and I am very excited about it! If you’vecontinued to work, do you have the day off too?"},

{"title": "Book Reviews – the April Edition", "date": "Wednesday, May 6, 2020", "text": "Well I slowed down quite a bit in April –I only read three books (four if you count the one I reread – I neededsomething familiar). Part of my problem is that, as I’ve mentioned before, I’mnot reading as much, but also I’m losing an hour and a half of book listeningtime on Sundays since I’m not going anywhere. Ah well, I’m halfway through twobooks that will go on May’s list, so maybe I’ll have a bigger list next month. 1. TheStarless Sea, by Erin Morgenstern.  ★★★★★ Abee, a key, and a sword emblazoned on the book lead Zachary Ezra Rawlins to twopeople who will change the course of his life: Mirabel, a fierce, pink-hairedpainter, and Dorian, a handsome, barefoot man with shifting alliances. Thesestrangers guide Zachary through masquerade party dances and whispered back roomstories to the headquarters of a secret society where doorknobs hang fromribbons, and finally through a door conjured from paint to the place he hasalways yearned for. Amid twisting tunnels filled with books, gilded ballrooms,and wine-dark shores Zachary falls into an intoxicating world soaked in romanceand mystery. But a battle is raging over the fate of this place and thoughthere are those who would willingly sacrifice everything to protect it, there arejust as many intent on its destruction. As Zachary, Mirabel, and Dorian venturedeeper into the space and its histories and myths, searching for answers andeach other, a timeless love story unspools, casting a spell of pirates,painters, lovers, liars, and ships that sail upon a Starless Sea. TheBug Says: Thisis by the same author as The Night Circus,which I also loved. And it’s just as weird. Maybe weirder? I’m not even surewhat exactly I was reading – it was like some sort of gamer world centered onbooks and stories and set deep in the earth. I think it might have containedsome sort of hallucinogens as well because I was mesmerized. I have no ideawhy. You would probably hate it. But I think I might have to read it again. 2. Varina,by Charles Frazier. ★★★★ With her marriageprospects limited, teenage Varina Howell agrees to wed the much-older widowerJefferson Davis, with whom she expects a life of security as a Mississippilandowner. He instead pursues a career in politics and is eventually appointedpresident of the Confederacy, placing Varina at the white-hot center of one ofthe darkest moments in American history—culpable regardless of her intentions.The Confederacy falling, her marriage in tatters, and the country divided,Varina and her children escape Richmond and travel south on their own, nowfugitives with “bounties on their heads, an entire nation in pursuit.”Intimate in its detailed observations of one woman’s tragic life and epic inits scope and power, Varina is a novel of an American war and its aftermath.Ultimately, the book is a portrait of a woman who comes to realize thatcomplicity carries consequences. TheBug Says: Ilove Charles Frazier’s writing (ColdMountain was so beautifully written), and this book did not disappoint. Iwouldn’t have picked it up on my own, but someone recommended it to me and I’mso glad! The premise of the book is that, many years after the war is over, ablack man discovers that he was one of the fugitives who was with Varina whenshe left Richmond. He tracks her down and asks her questions about that time. Ihave no idea how historically accurate the book is, but the storytelling wasreally good.3. AlaceSweets, by MariaLisa deMora. ★★★ Atseventeen, Alace Sweets turned a corner in her life, taking the wrong shortcuthome from school. Resisting the harsh knowledge her attackers will never bemade to pay for their actions, Alace takes a stand. Justice must be served, andif fate’s scales are out of balance, she’s determined to set things right asbest she can. When the laws of men fail, the rules of Alace prevail.TheBug Says: Thiswas an Amazon freebie that I read for book club (you may recall that wesometimes choose a number & then have the read the book in that place onthe list of 100 free Amazon titles). It was surprisingly good for a freebie.Alace is basically a vigilante serial killer after having been raped at 17. Shetakes care of her attackers first, and then, using an alias that starts with anew letter of the alphabet she seeks out other people who need to be brought tojustice (she was on P when the book started). It was a bit graphic, and also hadsome pretty explicit sex, but if you like books where people who “had it coming”get it, then this one is for you.So that’s it for this month. Next month I’ll be reviewing Untamed by GlennonDoyle, and The Great Alone by Kristin Hannah. At 79% and 58% read thus far I’mat 5 stars and 4 stars. We’ll see if the remainder of the books changes thoseratings. Did you read anything interesting?"},

What good is the economy if we killeven more people? And like I read someone else saying, it feels likeinteresting timing, coming just after we heard how devastating this virus is topeople of color and the poorest among us. “Oh we don’t care about those people –we just want our money” I don’t feellike I’m articulating this very well.

{"title": "Book Reviews - the March Edition", "date": "Tuesday, April 7, 2020", "text": "It seems crazy that another monthhas ended & it’s time for my book reviews. It feels like I should begetting even more reading done these days, but as I think I mentioned inanother post I’m having trouble concentrating. Nevertheless, I have six booksto review.1. Something Read,Something Dead (LighthouseLibrary Series #5), by Eva Gates.  ★★★★ Dark deeds in the Lighthouse Library threatento send Lucy Richardson's soon-to-be-wed cousin Josie to an early'til-death-do-us-part. The Bug Says: Somehow I accidentally ended up reading the 5thbook in this series without having read any of others. It was pretty cute – a cozymystery set in a library in a lighthouse on the NC coast? Sign me up!2. The Lonely HeartsHotel, by Heather O’Neill. Did Not Finish A spellbinding story about two giftedorphans in love with each other since they can remember whose childhood talentsallow them to rewrite their future.The Lonely Hearts Hotel is a love story with the power of legend. Anunparalleled tale of charismatic pianos, invisible dance partners, radicalizedchorus girls, drug-addicted musicians, brooding clowns, and an underworld whoseeconomy hinges on the price of a kiss. In a landscape like this, it takes greatcreative gifts to thwart one's origins. It might also take true love.The Bug Says: I never don’tfinish a book. Well, let’s say I finish about 99.9% of the books I start. Butthis one was just too…. I can’t even describe it. I might have been ok with thevery dark and slightly pornographicstory line, but the style of the writing was just too weird for me. It got soannoying that I did something else I never do – found a review that told howthe story ended. Once I saw where this was headed I decided to not waste anymore time on it. Lots of other people like it though, so have at it if itsounds interesting to you.3. The Hate U Give,by Angie Thomas. ★★★★★ Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: thepoor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school sheattends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnessesthe fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a policeofficer. Khalil was unarmed.Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some arecalling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters aretaking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord tryto intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what reallywent down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend hercommunity. It could also endanger her life.The Bug Says: I didn’t think I would like this book. The subjectmatter is difficult. The main character is a teenage girl (and I am so tired ofbooks about teenage girls). But it was sogood. I’ve been sitting here for a few minutes trying to explain what wasso good (the relationships between the characters, the humor, the descriptionsof the balancing act that Starr engages in every day…). I don’t know why – itjust clicked. Also, the narrator did a great job, which always helps.  4. The Water Dancer , by Ta-Nehisi Coates. ★★★★★ Young Hiram Walker was born intobondage—and lost his mother and all memory of her when he was a child—but he isalso gifted with a mysterious power. Hiram almost drowns when he crashes acarriage into a river, but is saved from the depths by a force he doesn'tunderstand, a blue light that lifts him up and lands him a mile away. Thisstrange brush with death forces a new urgency on Hiram's private rebellion.Spurred on by his improvised plantation family, Thena, his chosen mother, awoman of few words and many secrets, and Sophia, a young woman fighting her ownwar even as she and Hiram fall in love, he becomes determined to escape theonly home he's ever known.So begins an unexpected journey into the covertwar on slavery that takes Hiram from the corrupt grandeur of Virginia's proudplantations to desperate guerrilla cells in the wilderness, from the coffin ofthe deep South to dangerously utopic movements in the North.TheBug Says: At the other end of thespectrum (or maybe at the beginning of the spectrum) from The Hate U Give isthis excellent book that gives a whole new twist to the Underground Railroad. Itis beautifully written, and the story is so fascinating. Again, not my usualfare, but I highly recommend it!5. The Giver of Stars, by Jojo Moyes. ★★★★ AliceWright marries handsome American Bennett Van Cleve hoping to escape herstifling life in England. But small-town Kentucky quickly proves equallyclaustrophobic, especially living alongside her overbearing father-in-law. Sowhen a call goes out for a team of women to deliver books as part of EleanorRoosevelt’s new traveling library, Alice signs on enthusiastically.The leader, and soon Alice’s greatestally, is Margery, a smart-talking, self-sufficient woman who’s never asked aman’s permission for anything. They will be joined by three other singularwomen who become known as the WPA Packhorse Librarians of Kentucky.The Bug Says: Set in a pre-WWII Kentucky mining town, this book hasall the themes that you might expect: misogyny, union busting, racism,anti-intellectualism… But it was a really good read – not as depressing as itsounds like it might be. 6. By Hook or By Crook (Crochet Mystery#3), by Betty Hechtman. ★★★Molly Pink's crochet group has a new mystery ontheir hands when they find a paper bag that contains a note that speaks ofremorse, a diary entry of the sorrow of parting, and a complicated piece offilet crochet that offers an obscure clue in pictures. Things get even morecomplicated when they find the talented crocheter-murdered by a box of poisonedmarzipan apples. The Bug Says: Here is another series book that I started in themiddle. I was attracted to it for obvious reasons (a crochet mystery? I’m in!),but it was just ok. The characters were a little bit annoying – but I thinkthat if I’d “met” them from the beginning I might have liked them better. But whatreally didn’t click for me was the “complicated piece of filet crochet” thatthey were using to solve the mystery. Some of the panels were just dumb. Yes,dumb. But it was a cute & fast read – I might read the next one if I comeacross it.I’m writing this out on the deck ona lovely spring Saturday afternoon. It would be the perfect time to finish mycurrent book (The Starless Sea – a verybizarre book that I’m strangely fascinated by). So I think I’ll just stopwriting now & start reading. What is holding your interest these days?"},

I felt kind of idiotic, but I left it on. It is so pretty around here! At least we have spring beautyto help see us through.

I still went to work – themain difference being that I used a LOT more hand sanitizer. And I have toadmit that I was feeling salty about it. I mean, if you ignore the reason forall this social distancing it’s an introvert’s dream!  I was reading all these tips for “what to dowith your down time” and “how to not be bored” and “10 productive things youcan do” and “you shouldn’t feel guilty for not doing anything” and thinking tomyself in my most snarky voice, whatEVER. But I have spent a day and a halfin my home, pretty much doing what I do every weekend, and I am now ready to goback to my office. Simmering underneath all of this is the very real fear thatwe are just at the beginning of something terrible and what will life look likein a month, or 6 weeks, or a year? So many people who are dying, and the oneswho get the virus and live may not return to full health. And all the economicramifications. And there’s no baseball. It is all terrible and hard.

It used to cover the bank there, butthis is the only patch that’s left. It’s where Dr. M got ours (that you can seein Monday’s picture). It has definitely grown from the tiny cutting that Dr. Mbrought home in a cup!Steve Reed uses the Waterlogue appsometimes to paintify photos. I decided to download it myself & was playingaround today. Thursday,March 19th     A cautionary tale: when you’re buying the giant container offat free Greek yogurt, make sure that it’s PLAIN and not vanilla, or you willhave a very weird dinner. I was eating a sweet potato with black beans, onions,& bbq sauce & thought I’d put a dollop of Greek yogurt on it. I justabout accused Dr. M of putting brown sugar on the potato before I figured outwhat was wrong.Friday,March 20th                                                                   Yellow-bellied Sapsucker and Red-bellied Woodpecker.

You know, it seems somehowappropriate that all of this madness is happening during the season of Lent. I’mbeing forced to slow down and reflect.

I hope that all of these preventive measures actually work -& I 100% think that they were necessary, but I also feel a littlefatalistic about it all. As in, is it too little too late? Also, if thesemeasures DO work, will there be a public outcry that they weren’t really necessary(because you can’t prove a negative)?

(Note: the bandage is overkill for the tiny cut, but Iwas trying to find something that would stay put. Do you know how hard it wasto keep a bandage on that cut during all the multitudinous handwashing that wasgoing on?) Then I had to go for mammogram #2 because they saw something on thefirst one (calcifications).

{"title": "Book Reviews - the February Edition", "date": "Wednesday, March 4, 2020", "text": "MyFebruary books were a mixed bag. I know you’ll be relieved to know that even I(the queen of the 4 star rating), can admit when I don’t love a book. 1. AGentleman in Moscow, by Amor Towles. ★★★★★ In 1922, Count Alexander Rostov isdeemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, and is sentenced tohouse arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin.Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in hislife, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuousdecades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel's doors.Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much largerworld of emotional discovery. Brimming with humor, a glittering cast ofcharacters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singularnovel casts a spell as it relates the count's endeavor to gain a deeperunderstanding of what it means to be a man of purpose. The Bug Says: Ohmy goodness, I LOVED this book! I had no idea what to expect, but it was compelling,and funny, and thoughtful, and an inside view of the Russian revolution. I’mnot really into historical fiction, but this is a story about a man and it iswonderful!2. AnnieFreeman’s Fabulous Traveling Funeral, by Kris Radish. ★★ For Katherine Givens and the fourwomen about to become her best friends, the adventure begins with a UPSpackage. Inside is a pair of red sneakers filled with ashes and a note thatwill forever change their lives. Katherine’s oldest and dearest friend, theirrepressible Annie Freeman, left one final request—a traveling funeral—and shewants the most important women in her life as “pallbearers.”The Bug Says: Ithought the premise of this book was great – the Annie Freeman wanted her womenfriends to scatter her ashes in places that meant something to her. However,every chapter contained what I would consider a book-ending narrative summingup how fabulous it all was (every. chapter.), and the “voice” of each of thewomen was exactly the same. The author was apparently unable to give all ofthese women their own personalities. There were a couple of scenes that I enjoyed,but otherwise I was skimming through as fast as I could.3. Goldenin Death (In Death, #50), by J. D. Robb. ★★★★ Pediatrician Kent Abner receivedthe package on a beautiful April morning. Inside was a cheap trinket, a goldenegg that could be opened into two halves. When he pried it apart, highly toxicairborne fumes entered his body and killed him.The Bug Says: Ican’t believe that we’re now on book 50of this series! Of course I loved it – it was like hanging out with familiarold friends. One little quibble – at the end of the book I was expecting a confrontation with one of the “bad guys,” but instead we just heardabout what happened elsewhere. 4. Belongto Me (LoveWalked In #2) , by Marisa de los Santos. ★★★★Marisa de los Santos's literary talents shine in the complex interactions shecreates between three women. She deftly explores the life-altering rollercoaster of emotions Piper faces as she cares for two households, her own andthat of her cancer-stricken best friend, Elizabeth. Skillfully, de los Santoscreates an enigmatic and beguiling character in Lake, who draws Cornelia closereven as she harbors a shocking secret. And from the first page until theexhilarating conclusion, de los Santos engages readers with Cornelia, who,while trying to adapt to her new surroundings, must remain true to herself. Astheir individual stories unfold, the women become entangled in a web of trust,betrayal, love, and loss that challenges them in ways they never imagined, andthat ultimately teaches them what it means for one human being to belong toanother.The Bug Says: Ohwhat a lovely book! I had read the first book in the series a while back andforgot that there were any sequels. I reallyhated the Piper character in the beginning (think, Nellie Oelson), but she isredeemed in the end. Although still true to her nature, so still annoying. Buteven though the description up there reads like a soap opera, it doesn’t feellike one. It feels like life. 5. TheSaturday Big Tent Wedding Party (No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency #12) ,by Alexander McCall Smith. ★★★★ At aremote cattle post south of Gaborone two cows have been killed, and PreciousRamotswe, Botswana’s No. 1 Lady Detective, is hired by fearful client, himselfa suspect. She and secretary Grace Makutsi, wooed by Phuti Radiphuti, both seeher old white van. Mr J.L.B. Matekoni’s apprentice runs away under pressure towed. Violet Sephotho runs for the Botswana Parliament.The Bug Says: Another fine installment in this series. I was kind ofsad that I couldn’t get the audio version (the narrator for this series is really good), but I enjoyed itnonetheless. However, here is one quibble: Mma. Makutsi was almost a caricatureof herself in this book (which is saying something because she’s pretty much acaricature all the time). It was still fun. 6. I’llbe Your Blue Sky (Love Walked In #3), by Marisa de losSantos. ★★★★ On the weekend of her wedding,Clare Hobbes meets an elderly woman named Edith Herron. During the course of asingle conversation, Edith gives Clare the courage to do what she should havedone months earlier: break off her engagement to her charming, yet overlypossessive, fiancé. Three weeks later, Clare learns that Edith has died—and hasgiven her another gift. Nestled in crepe myrtle and hydrangea and perched atthe marshy edge of a bay in a small seaside town in Delaware, Blue Sky Housenow belongs to Clare. Exploring the house, Clare finds two mysterious ledgershidden beneath the kitchen sink. Edith, it seems, was no ordinary woman—andBlue Sky House no ordinary place. With the help of her mother, Viviana, hersurrogate mother, Cornelia Brown, and her former boyfriend and best friend, DevTremain, Clare begins to piece together the story of Blue Sky House…The Bug Says: This one was even better than the 2nd bookin the series. It was just so very satisfactory, even though it dealt, in part,with another difficult subject (domestic violence). There’s one more book inthe series – don’t be surprised if that one shows up on March’s book review. I’msurprised that I ended up getting 6 books read in February – must have been allthat skimming in that second book up there. Well, and I do tend to devour theIn Death books. I know it’s only been a couple of weeks since I last asked, buthave you read anything interesting lately?"},

{"title": "Book Reviews - the January Edition", "date": "Friday, February 21, 2020", "text": "I’m pretty sure there’s a library about 900 miles closer to me. SteveReed is reading all of the Newbery Award winners & was talking about AWrinkle in Time, which he loved. I looked back & I gave it three stars. Isort of remember not being terribly impressed by it, but now I can’t rememberwhy. So I’m going to try to post my books once per month in my old (2016)format in the hope that my commentary will jog my memory later. Which is justvery sad if you think about, so let’s not, ok? Anyway, here are January’s booksfor your perusal & my swiss cheese memory. 1. Land of Wolves (WaltLongmire #15), by Craig Johnson. ★★★★★ Wyoming Sheriff Walt Longmire isneck deep in the investigation of what could or could not be the suicidalhanging of a shepherd. With unsettling connections to a Basque family with areputation for removing the legs of Absaroka County sheriffs, matters becomeeven more complicated with the appearance of an oversize wolf in the Big HornMountains to which Walt finds himself feeling more and more empathetic. The Bug Says:I love everything about this series. It’s smart and funny and the mystery isusually really good. The main characters are interesting and I care about themas people, and Walt Longmire himself is just the best. This addition to theseries was excellent. Highly recommend!2. The Murmur of Bees,by Sofia Segovia. ★★★★★ From the day that old Nana Reja found a babyabandoned under a bridge, the life of a small Mexican town forever changed.Disfigured and covered in a blanket of bees, little Simonopio is for somelocals the stuff of superstition, a child kissed by the devil. But he iswelcomed by landowners Francisco and Beatriz Morales, who adopt him and carefor him as if he were their own. Set against the backdrop of the MexicanRevolution and the devastating influenza of 1918, The Murmur of Bees capturesboth the fate of a country in flux and the destiny of one family that has puttheir love, faith, and future in the unbelievable. The Bug Says:You’ve already seen the picture of my emotional face when I finished this book.In the ordinary course of events I would never have picked it up – sounded melodramaticand I didn’t really want to read about the Mexican Revolution. But thecharacters pulled me in and surprised me by kindness and good humor, althoughthere is definitely tragedy. And the writing is just so beautiful. Again, Ihighly recommend this one!3. Euphoria, by LilyKing. ★★★★In 1933 three young, gifted anthropologists are thrown together inthe jungle of New Guinea. They are Nell Stone, fascinating, magnetic and famousfor her controversial work studying South Pacific tribes, her intelligent andaggressive husband Fen, and Andrew Bankson, who stumbles into the lives of thisstrange couple and becomes totally enthralled. Within months the trio areproducing their best ever work, but soon a firestorm of fierce love andjealousy begins to burn out of control, threatening their bonds, their careers,and, ultimately, their lives. The Bug Says:This is another book that I wouldn’t ordinarily have read. It’s loosely (veryloosely) based on the life of Margaret Mead. It’s well written and thecharacters are interesting, but it sort of feels like I was given some sort ofdrug which enthralled me the same as Bankson was enthralled. When I finished Ifelt like I had a hangover and dreamed about the book for a while afterward. Itwas very disturbing and I couldn’t put it down. (I feel like I have to post atrigger warning here – there’s some allusions to domestic violence which reallydisturbed me.)4. The Quiche of Death (AgathaRaisin #1) ★★★★, by M.C. Beaton. Agatha Raisin gives up her successful PRfirm, sells her London flat, and samples a taste of early retirement in thequiet village of Carsely. Bored, lonely and used to getting her way, she entersa local baking contest: Surely a blue ribbon for the best quiche will make herthe toast of the town. But her recipe for social advancement sours when JudgeCummings-Browne not only snubs her entry--but falls over dead! After herquiche's secret ingredient turns out to be poison, she must reveal the unsavorytruth…Agatha bought the quiche ready-made.  The Bug Says:I obviously went for something completely different with my next book, and itdid not disappoint. Apparently I’m late to this series (which is also atelevision show?), but I was thrilled to find it. There are thirty books! Itwas a lot of fun, even though the main character is not all that likeable atfirst. Or second. Or third. You think she’s somewhat rehabilitated and then hertrue nature shines forth again. It was a lot of fun.5. The Vicious Vet (AgathaRaisin #2) ★★★, by M.C. Beaton. Handsome vet Paul Bladen accidentallykills himself while attending Lord Pendlebury's horse. Agatha and attractiveneighbor James Lacey investigate the curious lack of sorrow shown by hisdivorced wife while a killer plans another \"accident\". The Bug Says:I didn’t enjoy this one quite as much as the first one. There was a lot of manchasing which seemed out of character, but maybe this is really what Agatha islike – we shall see! But the mystery was still pretty good.I’ve only read threebooks in February. Hopefully I’ll get another couple in before the end of themonth, or my next book post will be pretty short. I’ll give you a teaser –there’s a 5 star, a 4 star, and a very rare (for me) 2 star on the list so far. What are you reading these days?"},

I’mnot sure if you can tell, but the yarn I used at the end on the left was sobulky that I had a sort of crinoline skirt situation going on there. In the meantime, the shawl I mailed off to Germany the otherweek made it to its destination! Saturday,February 15th                Dr. M put new flowers on his mother’s grave – he chose MardiGras colors to cheer himself up.Today I frogged the crinoline skirt & decided that theshawl was just done. DONE. It’s soft and comfy and I think I have a blindfoldthat I can give with it so the recipient doesn’t have to look at it. Ha! (I don’tactually think it’s that hideous, but it definitely has a scraptastic auraabout it).I’m very pleased to announce that I’m turning my crochethook to other, lovelier, projects now. I’m sure that eases your mind. Whatcrafty things are you doing these days?"},

Thursday,February 6th     Dr. M used more veggies from our box to make me a fabulouschicken soup. YUM!Friday,February 7th                                                                 I posted this on Instagram & FB talking about how I hadsolved the problem of flipping a fried egg, but I wasn’t exactly clear. I justcrack the egg into the pan, add salt & pepper, and then put a lid on it& let it cook. Works great! I do have to be careful to not overcook it or Iwon’t have a runny yolk like I like it – I cook it on medium & check itfrequently.We wore red to work to raise awareness of heart disease. I’min the upper left of the photo, wearing jeans & a solid red shirt. .Saturday,February 8th                We had a cute little snow and I finished A Gentleman inMoscow and I LOVED it. I highly recommend it (but my feelings won’t be hurtif you don’t like it – it’s not everyone’s cup of tea). Dr. M made anotherexcellent meal with our box ingredients. That cubed stuff is celery root. Celeryroot! I had no idea that was even a thing. It sort of reminded us of eggplantin texture. We also had spaghetti squash and pasta sauce with veggie crumbles. Onthe one hand, I would love to have tomorrow off from work. On the other hand, exceptfor excursions to vacuum and go to church, my butt has been basically glued tomy recliner for two days.

I’ve spent the last few years zoningout playing games on my iPad, or crocheting, and have neglected my readingquite a bit. It doesn’t help that when we moved from Ohio my commute went from50 minutes each way to 0 minutes for one year, and then 25 minutes each way after that. I lost a lotof valuable audiobook time. Not that I’m complaining! In any case, I decided tobe more intentional this year, and I amazed myself by actually reaching my goalwith a couple of days to spare! I was especially pleased because I basicallytook the month of July off to listen to Annie F. Downs’ EnneaSummer 2019 podcasts.(I need to do an enneagram blog post sometime. Not that I know what I’m talkingabout, really – but when has that stopped me?)Anyway, I decided that instead of doing a post ofall the books I’ve read this year I would just highlight the ones that I gave 5stars to. Please realize that I am almost always delighted by books and givehigher ratings than most people do. But if I give it 5 stars then that means Ireally really loved it. (Descriptions are from Goodreads.)Fiction·        Big Sky (Jackson Brodie, #5), Kate Atkinson.

A groundbreaking workfrom a master, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rareunderstanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories toreveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out.

Beloved authorElizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction with a unique love story set in the NewYork City theater world during the 1940s. Told from the perspective of an olderwoman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostlypleasure), City of Girls explores themes of female sexuality andpromiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love.·        Dear Committee Members, Julie Schumacher. The vehicle this drolland inventive novel uses to tell that tale is a series of hilarious letters ofrecommendation that Fitger is endlessly called upon by his students andcolleagues to produce, each one of which is a small masterpiece of highdudgeon, low spirits, and passive-aggressive strategies. ·        In the Company of Cheerful Ladies, Alexander McCall Smith. In the newest addition (#6) to theuniversally beloved No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency series, the charming andever-resourceful Precious Ramotswe finds herself overly beset byproblems. As usual.·        The Feast of Love, Charles Baxter. In vignettes both comic and sexy… disparatepeople joined by the meanderings of love…come together in a tapestry thatdepicts the most irresistible arena of life. ·        Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of AgnesNutter, Witch, Neil Gaiman& Terry Pratchett.

Everything appears to be goingaccording to Divine Plan. Except a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-livingdemon—both of whom have lived amongst Earth's mortals since The Beginning andhave grown rather fond of the lifestyle—are not actually looking forward to thecoming Rapture. And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist . . .·        Olive Kitteridge, Elizabeth Strout.

In other news, I’m due for some color on my hair. I was thinking ofgoing silver. Thoughts? Prayers?” I had 5 votes for no silver & 7 forsilver (or at least to stop coloring my hair).

Kim won the ornament exchange when she gave each of us a Mars Hill Sisters ornament – so cool! I wish my hair actually looked like that (except in silver.Maybe.). Dr. M made french toast casserole & it was the bomb.This will be another weird work week with a day off in themiddle.

Sweet!The moon!Friday,December 13th                                                              My lunch was super healthy - until I added a hunk ofcornbread as big as my head. Worth it!Dr. M’s brother gave us the crocodile ornament, so it’sgetting pride of place on the tree this year in his memory.Saturday,December 14th              While I did some cleaning, crocheting, and poem writing, Dr.M decorated the tree! It’s as eclectic as we are. Tomorrow is our 29th anniversary & we are goingto see the Nutcracker in Charlotte. I’m very excited – almost as much for thecar ride with Dr. M as for the ballet. It will be fun spending time with myfavorite person. Are you doing anything fun?"},

So this might be very brief. Or, like an overtiredtoddler, I might start blathering on. Who knows? We shall see. Sunday,December 1st                                                  My cousin and her family finally joined the church that theyinvited me to almost three years ago (where I am now on church council and the chair of the GreenCommittee – apparently I’m hastier than they are). It was my brother’s birthday so my dad took us all out fordinner. That salmon was good!Monday,December 2nd                Dr. M did a bit of decorating. We have no idea who gave usthis, but we are enamored. It now lives in Dr. M’s bathroom.           Tuesday,December 3rd                                                     I took a couple of things in to decorate my office. Wednesday,December 4th                                                        Dr. M put the tree up! My dadhad found this angel at his house & decided that I needed it. The reflectionof the tree is lovely, but also confusing. One of my friends on FB said that atfirst she thought we had decorated a cactus. Ha! I said goodnight to Hilda thesheep (from our Manor Farmcalendar). Thursday,December 5th Dr. M took a last swipe aroundthe yard, mulching leaves, and then put the mower on the trailer so he couldtake it to his dad’s house for the winter (he has a shed).  Friday,December 6th                                                              Our local University (Lenoir-Rhyne – we’re poor relations) wasin a quarterfinal championship game so city employees wore red & black insolidarity. I’m in the back in the group picture, standing on the edge of thefountain & almost falling in. Fun times! Sadly, LR lost the game – but whata great year they had!Saturday,December 7th              For reasons unknown to me I signed up to manage our PrayerSister program this year & organize the annual brunch. This mostly involvedputting a note in the church bulletin & begging my cousin to basicallyfigure out the decorations. She did great! It was a pot luck, so that part waseasy. We had a lovely time. We hope to grow the group, but it was nice to beable to fit around this one table this year. My Prayer Sister liked the scarf Imade her. Whew! (I got what I consider to be the best gift of the day, but Iwill share it later. I’ll just say that it made my bag lady heart go pitterpatter). Today was a busy day: singing at the nursing home, then atchurch I did about four things during the service, then we had our annualmeeting, and then we had anemergency church council meeting because our pastor resigned. His wife got herdream job in Pittsburgh, where they’re from. They recently had twins so I’m notsurprised that they want to be closer to their parents, but we will definitely missthem!Has your weekend been nice & relaxing, or are youwishing (like I am) that you had another day off to recuperate?"},

They’re kind of weird colorsbecause these are the colors I have & I couldn’t find any others in storesaround here. If I do this again I will plan ahead & order what I want!Well, back to work tomorrow. PLUS I have a WW weigh-in andthat won’t be pretty. I would appreciate some thoughts and prayers. And whileyou’re at it, go ahead & pray for people who really need it: the homeless,the folks who are fighting addictions and disease, the ones who are affected bygun violence, the people who are marginalized in our society (because, you knowthat’s where Jesus is anyway & he might like some help)."},

This is a mason jar salad set that I got from Pampered Chef. I’mhoping it inspires me to eat more salad. Also, there is kale in that jar. I felt extra virtuous. We got our second produce box from Misfits Market & (amongother Bug approved items) there was this GIANT head of cabbage. I hate cabbage.I jokingly told Dr. M that it was too bad we hadn’t signed up to take coleslawto Thanksgiving, & he promptly looked up a Thanksgiving Coleslaw recipe. Saturday,November 23rd             The ornament exchange was today. One of my friends is incharge of decorating, and while several other ladies also decorated tables(including my dad’s wife Sue), Jenny did four of them. They were all amazing –these are just photos of a few. I had a good time - & other than an overlyfriendly encounter with pecan pie, I actually didn’t go overboard with themeal.This coming week is my favorite kind – a three day workweek.

I went to hear The Right Reverend Katharine Jefferts Schorispeak about climate change. She was the Presiding Bishop of the EpiscopalChurch of the United States (the first woman to hold that position) for about 9years while I lived in Ohio. I didn’t realize that her background is inoceanography – she has a doctorate in that field, so she is able to addressclimate change from a spiritual perspective & a scientific one. It was a great talk. She asked if we were treating our earth like the Promised Land. And I wasintroduced to the concept of solastalgia (a form of mental orexistential distress caused by environmental change. In many cases this is inreference to global climate change, but more localized events such as volcaniceruptions, drought or destructive mining techniques can cause solastalgia as well.).My favorite quote was this one, in answer to what you say to people who don’tbelieve in climate science: “Climate science is not a political issue – it’s areality issue. I don’t associate politics with reality. We can put our heads inthe sand, but we’re still going to roast our rear ends.” I’m not sure I can top that quote. There’s a blizzard inMontana, and in the 90s here, and there’s a category 5 hurricane brewing in theeastern Atlantic. Have a great week? P.S.

I actually felt bad for the executioners. They were just doing theirjobs, and that is not a snide comment. But I must say the sheer ignorance oflife as an academic on display that day was appalling. The people offering“placement assistance” so obviously had never seen the stacks of rejectionletters that are the norm for fledgling Ph.D.s, especially in Humanities, justtrying to get a full-time gig. I had gotten my chance to be THE historyprofessor, had given UU seven years of nearly year-round teaching, had earnedtenure under the old system even though I had to defer my dream of publishingmy manuscript, and had survived personal tragedy and unexpected mental andemotional struggles, all in an effort to be what UU needed.

But for heaven's sake (literally - what the heck Christians?). Idon't want my silence to imply that I approve of our president telling congressmembers to \"go back\" to where they came from. They came fromdistricts who elected & sent them forth to work for their interests.They're right where they belong. It also is clearly racist, and another strikeagainst women. That's how we're making America great? Letting a man whoobjectifies and apparently dislikes women (except for one thing) guide ourcountry? A man who clearly dislikes people of color? He is supposed to be thepresident for ALL of us. And I'm just so sad and angry that he's apparently thepresident that so many people wanted.

There was a time when flags were rarely flown and greatly respected.As a youth, I was taught NEVER to leave a flag out in the rain. In this age ofconspicuous consumption, flags have become ubiquitous and careworn. There is amoral in this. Too often our people are treated like our flags...left out torot! My grandfather, Preacher Friday, treated the people around him with thesame dignity and respect he taught me to treat the flag. Would that we as anation could relearn this lesson!I started crocheting my mandalas to hoops. There might havebeen some cursing involved. Friday,July 5th                                                        Made dinner for Dr. M. I think it’s finally time to admitthat I do actually cook, and that it’s often quite edible. I’m not the chefthat Dr. M is, but we aren’t starving while he’s incapacitated. Saturday,July 6th       My father-in-law’s hydrangea – gorgeous!These crazy things are FINALLY done. Woo hoo! They were so muchfun to make (except for the hoop business – that was a PITA). OK, the Braves won by the skin of their teeth. I think I canmove on with my life now. Have a great week everyone!"},

Because I ain’t doing it when it’s in the90s outside. In fact, I’m just going to place a moratorium on cleaning anycloth items in the house. If I have to go to work nekkid, so be it (note: thereis NO DANGER of me running out of clothes to wear before the weather cools down).Sunday,June 23rd                                         Dr. M caught a glimpse of the baby wren – apparently shortlybefore it fledged.

Here iswhat he said (if you didn’t already think he was a nut, this will convince you):Imatellyawhat, that @danabugly is gettin serious about the yard work! I changedout the air filter and spark plug in Lil Red Ridin Good (under her rain cover)to fix a hitch in her (the mower’s) giddy up, checked out the battery poweredweed eater, and serviced Benicio el Toro so she could have a trim mower (newblade, air filter, and spark plug, fresh oil and gas). Heck, I even sprayed thetool shed lock with WD 40 so she maybe can get in it now. Phew, where’s myice pack?Wednesday,June 26th                                                       Your weekly daylilies.Thursday,June 27th                                                        The only picture is this “before” shot of my little ponytail. I like to sleep with my hair pulled up so that it’s not so hot. It alsogives it some body the next day if I’m not going to wash it. There’s no “after”picture – I was going to show how goofy it looks in the morning, but nobodyneeded to see that. Whew boy!Friday,June 28th                                                        What I think my hair looks like during the day vs. what itreally looks like. Who can get any work done with all that hair in your face?Saturday,June 29th       Finished! Well, except that I need to find some mandalarings to crochet them onto. They’re going to be wall hangings for my office.Also, maybe they’re not finished because I finished the last one with purple& I like that a lot better than the red, so I might add some purple rows tothe smaller ones. We’ll see.We sang patriotic songs at church this morning. And this isthe end of pride month – I can’t imagine what it would feel like to be a gayperson in today’s climate (or a person of color either). And there are childrenliving in criminal conditions. I know I tend to be pie in the sky, but it’shard for me to be patriotic when there are so many blatant injustices –injustices that supposed “good” people rationalize away with “but they shouldn’t.”I don’t care if they should or shouldn’t – they should all be treated with dignityand basic human rights. (Although let’s face it, as a bleeding heart liberal Iusually think they should have fabulous human rights, not just the basic ones.)OK, getting off of my soapbox now. Have a great week everyone!"},

My fellow HR coworkers & I worked – taking raffletickets & handing out game tickets. It started out rainy, but ended up beingjust fine. I had some good BBQ & ice cream, but I didn’t stay for the game.I was exhausted! I skipped church againtoday because I didn’t feel well.

I wore this to work & my boss commented that it was a nice suit& she hoped I didn’t have a job interview. I said that I thought this suitwas a little casual for job interviews & that I thought of it as my MiamiVice look (and that in fact it probably went back to that era). After she &my coworker stopped laughing they decided that my new nickname is Miami. (Myold nickname was Eagle Eye because I have a really irritating habit of noticingmisspellings & such. Really.

As of this morning, my dad had gotten over 11 inches of rain inabout two days. Dr. M posted a couple of videos of water running behind ourhouse & across the street. It was pretty impressive (even if these screengrabs aren’t all that impressive). Lots of damage in our area! Fortunately thesun is currently shining, so hopefully people have been able to start gettingback to normal. All of this crazy weather is just another reminder that theeffects of climate change are not “someday” or a problem for future generationsto handle.

Although to be fair to myself, most ofthis stuff is very similar to work I’ve done in the past, so perhaps it won’ttake as long as I think to get the hang of things.   Be thinking about Dr. M tomorrow - he has his first cortisone injection. Big thanks to my dad who will be driving him there. He's pretty nervous about it (Dr. M, not my dad) - here's hoping that it goes smoothly & has a big impact for the better on how he feels!"},

I finally figured out a work-around today (open the blog inGoogle, not Bloglovin or Safari), so I’ve mostly caught up. However, for someof you I didn’t go back & comment on posts that I’d already read. I’llcatch you next time!Dr. M’s surgeon does recommend surgery - fusion from L4 toS1 to deal with the ruptured disks, etc. But for insurance reasons he will haveto go through physical therapy first. We’re hopeful that the PT will at leaststrengthen his muscles so that his recovery from surgery is quicker – but it’snot going to be a lot of fun. Now, on to the pictures, which are mostly of food andflowers – the two staples of life around here. Sunday,April 21st – Easter Sunday                                      We had a fabulous service at church, with a lot of goodmusic. But before I got there I made myself a fancy breakfast. I’ve becomeobsessed with the concept of savory oatmeal, and found this recipe online thatused a fried egg, avocado slices and cherry tomatoes – all of which I happenedto have to hand. Mine is on the left & the picture from the recipe is onthe right. I forgot the parmesan cheese, but it was really good! I sort of hadto suspend the idea that it was oatmeal, but once I did that I was good to go. Front yard flowers (or potential flowers, in the case of thewildflower bed). Monday,April 22nd                  The only picture we took today was the tree in the back yard(I’m getting ready to post a video of the transition from leafless toleaf-full). Tuesday,April 23rd                                                 Today was unexpectedly my last day at work! I had finishedtraining my replacement so she kicked me to the curb. I did NOT argue – ha!Before I left I went to the post office and parked under my favorite tree for abit. I probably won’t be in that part of town again any time soon. I took my last furniture picture. My coworkers gave me a beautiful purse made by the samecompany that supplies some of the leather for our furniture. And on the way homeI got myself some celebratory cake (this is a tiny little cake – which is goodbecause I ate most of it myself). And even though I already have too many pictures in thispost I had to share this one. I went to book club and took a photo of thisbench when I left – Benchamin Franklin – ha!Wednesday,April 24h                                                Our Knockout Rose is going to be amazing soon!Thursday,April 25th                                                    Today we went to Dr. M’s dad’s house, where I ate atreasured food from my childhood: Bologna & cheese with Duke’s mayonnaise.Yum!His azalea is winding down. That evening I FINALLY finished crocheting this project – ithas only taken me three months. I had to block it slightly (that’s two panelsthere & one was slightly shorter than the other one because of a differencein crochet tension). I’ve assembled it, but you’ll have to wait until next weekto see what it is. Friday,April 26th                                                  A blue bunting on the feeder! So gorgeous!More food – I put dill pickle flavored potato chips on mytuna salad. YUM!Saturday,April 27th     More flowers around the house – it’s such a lovely time ofyear. It was Sue’s birthday so I took her present to her. I gother a necklace from my friend Becci at Feryl Designs (she has a salegoing on for the next couple of days – check it out!). It was pretty wild thatit matched Sue’s outfit so well!I start my new job tomorrow. I’ve packed my lunch and pickedout what I’m going to wear. I’m not as nervous as I thought I would be – hope thatbodes well! It’s a REALLY busy time for my position so I’m sure I’ll have tojump in with both feet. I’ll tell you all about it next week!"},

That thing is ginormous! And a little risqué, in myopinion.Monday,April 8th                 Dr. M’s spinal issues have become quite severe in the lastfew months. He has constant burning pain up and down his right side, and thenif he stands for too long his leg goes numb. He was referred to a spinespecialist at Wake Forest Baptist Hospital and had his initial consultation& x-rays today. He is pessimistic that the surgeon will be able to help him,but I am holding out hope.

I became paranoid that I’d donesomething to my hip (interesting how similar the pain is), so I had them workme in at my surgeon’s office. They took an x-ray & the hip is fabulous –yay! However, I do have some soft tissue and bursa pain in the lower back. She recommendedice. Of course, because ice is the answer to everything. The next day I had anappointment with my regular doctor & she decided that steroids might help.ANYWAY, this picture has nothing to do with any of that. This week was HighPoint Furniture Market week & so most of our folks were there. I had tostay to lock up the office & the last thing that I did each evening waslock this gate.

On a whim last month I applied for adifferent job. Late Thursday they called to say that I was their finalcandidate and that they’d be calling my references, which meant that I had totell my boss about it. I told him today, and by the end of the day he hadsomeone scheduled to start on Monday for me to train. I still have to jumpthrough a couple of hoops so I don’t want to announce anything officially, butif all goes well I start the new position on April 29th. And now Iam totally overwhelmed with the idea of training someone. I’m a terribleteacher. And it feels like everything I do is so complicated (because I make itcomplicated, in my opinion). I try to remember that when I started I got apretty basic training & then I just learned all this as I went along. It’sall gonna be just ok, right?Saturday,April 13th     Azaleas at Dr. M’s dad’s house. They’re just out of control.I hope ours look like that someday!Just a bathroom mouthwash selfie.

I posted it on Instagram &Facebook & said “Caption this. #tbt third grade.” I have several things tosay about this. First of all, I posted this on Wednesday, not Thursday. Second,I look stoned. Third, please note the notch in my bangs. Yep – I tried to cutthem myself. The first of many times –I got better at it.Thursday,February 7th                                                 I finished this audio book today. I love this series becauseit reminds me of my time in Zambia – there is a lot of meandering to get themystery solved. Also, the narrator is really good. Friday,February 8th                                                 More furniture. Saturday,February 9th The battery on the Bugly died. Please note the veryconveniently placed sway bar right over the battery – Dr. M had to remove the fusebox to get to the screws to remove the bar so he could get the battery out.While Dr. M was working on the car I decided to do a veryprimitive repair on his favorite cotton blanket (he likes to turn himself intoa Dr. M burrito when he sleeps). I am really not very good at sewing, but I waspleased to at least stop the unraveling (for now). While I had the sewing kitout, I sewed buttons back onto two pairs of pants. I felt quite domestic! I’m just not even going to have any technology hopes forthis week. Que Sera Sera is what I say!"},

The characterin my book was describing the experience of drinking tea made in a pot thatusually had coffee in it. Blech!At the workshop we walked outside, then came in and drewpictures that depicted how we felt about it. My picture is of me looking downto see the pine sprig that I found (that’s my boot & the bottom of mydress). I was VERY impressed by the 12 year old son of the local imam who was there – so articulate.I took a picture of his drawing. It says “A WORLD TO LOSE.” I was also reallyimpressed with our vegetarian lunch (from here)– it was delicious. Here’s hoping that this week technology is my friend.

The area was still scaly, but now it was red and annoyed. I messaged my doctor & she said that I could use hydrocortisone, so I pulled out our trusty bin 'o medical stuff and found the tube therein. For some reason, I checked the expiration date. May 2009.2009And yet I very nearly used it anyway, except it was sort of yellowish. I seriously have no sense whatsoever.

They brought him a very appropriate gift, but the winner of thewhole birthday extravaganza was this card from my brother & sister-in-law. Andlo!

He said he wanted to make surethe lights work.He also wanted to assure folks that we do have some fall décortoo. Ha!You guys were no help at all in figuring out what to giveDr. M for his birthday, so he ended up getting what I get him about 80% of thetime: shirts. Poor guy. Are you guys ready for Thanksgiving?

I have to admit though, that this picture makes my eyes cross because sometimes the bobbles pop out & other times they look like dents in the square.

Itwouldn’t hold still & the camera wasn’t set up for motion – but I like theshadow effect anyway. The skipper butterfly on the other hand stayed put, sothat picture is pretty good. Here are the aforementioned flowers. And block 16 in my second colorway.Thursday,August 23rd            My crazy desk at work. I oftenhave paper everywhere, including on the keyboard. One of these days I’ll comeup with a better system. Ha!Pearl crescent butterfly. Youcan’t tell, but it’s tiny.I had to laugh at the difference in mall walking & mowing this time of year. Our grass is SO THICK andalmost always damp, so I have to mow VERY SLOWLY. It’s more of a (very loud) walkingmeditation than cardio exercise. Friday,August 24th                                  Morning glories and a surpriseazalea! We didn’t really realize it, but they are called “Encore” for a reason.Fun!Block 16 in my 3rdcolorway. You’ll have to wait until next week to see the 4th one. Iknow that makes you very sad. Ha!Saturday,August 25th                                       Dr. M’s Saturday project – putting this thing together. I’mso excited! I’ve been using a Tony Little Gazelle for YEARS. It has been greatat helping me get more steps in my day, but not so great at cardio. Now that myhip is fixed (hallelujah) I’m ready to up my fitness game. Speaking of my hip, its year anniversary was this week. Ican’t believe that a year has already passed, and I can’t believe how good Ifeel. I have my final follow-up appointment next week – which will just be alot of gushing on both sides (“You’re doing so great!” “I know! Right?”). Well,I’m off to use my new treadmill. It has built in speakers – I plan to plug myphone in & listen to the audio version of The Martian for the eleventy-seventhtime. Do you have anything fun planned for your evening?"},

There are parts of our county that remind me an awful lot of Ohio.Saturday,June 9th                                    My Facebook caption for this photo: What is it about thecrochet soul that craves a new project even when there are six WIPs withinarm’s reach? (WIPS = works in progress)Wildflowers!  Last week I talked about the blogger emailing of commentsproblem. This week I discovered that there have been comments awaitingmoderation since December. I used tosee a notification on my main blogger dashboard that there were commentsawaiting moderation, but apparently now you have to remember to click on it.So, for those of you who ended up in comment moderation timeout – so sorry!"},

Dr. M & I have been so amused by these Dr. Seussianflowers – their buds look like troll hats.Tuesday,May 29th                                                 Onto the next square pattern, 1stcolorway. So last year Dr. M brought homea rose cutting from his dad’s house & planted it in the same pot as ourpalm tree & we waited. This spring we saw a sprout & got very excited.After it had grown a bit, Dr. M put it in its own pot. And then it bloomed! Asyou can clearly see, this is not a rose. It is an impatiens. We are highlyamused. We think it got planted last spring when Dr. M would bring in impatienspoppers for me since I couldn’t go out to the flower bed. I love to pop thepoppers :)Wednesday,May 30th    Sexy Ms. Pinky.The frame shop at work is in the basement. It seems like Igo up & down these steps at least once a day (today I did it three times).Every time I do it I think about how this time last year I was having trouble goingover the door step to get out on our deck. Thursday,May 31st      Calla lily outside at work. Lovely!Friday,June 1st                              New square in the 2nd colorway.Wildflowers!Saturday,June 2nd                                   Our first daylily! Dr. M scavenged these from the roadsideearlier this year. I went to my cousin’s surprise birthday party & found myother cousin’s daughters. The baby is a cutie, but her older sister was mypartner in crime. We just wanted birthday cake. Ha!I’ll try to remember to come back here periodically to seeif there are any comments, and maybe I’ll even reply. Hey, it could happen!"},

Clockwise, from the top right: Grackles, Tufted Titmouse,Carolina Chickadee, Brown Thrasher, Mr. and Mrs. Cardinal, Eastern Phoebe, Doves,and a very rare Bunny Bird!Wednesday,May 9th   We had someone come to mow at work & he nearly fell downthis bank, so I took a picture to send to a landscaper friend (hi David!) tosee what we could do here that doesn’t involve mowing or weed eating (orround-upping). Then I forgot to send the picture to my friend. Oops. Thursday,May 10th     I did the 10 pictures on the 10thof the month thing! Except I only took 8 pictures. And I never posted them.

I went out into the plant to find the systemthat runs the buzzer telling folks when to go on breaks & then I took apicture so I could remember what brand it was; 3. I spent pretty much the rest ofthe day reconciling payments made on one particular account; 4. I finallyremembered to park under the awning so my car wouldn’t be so hot; 5. You cansee how well that worked out for me – had to dash out there at the end of theday in the pouring rain; 6. Went home & crocheted; 7. And watched baseball; 8. And gotready for bed. Very exciting day!Friday,May 11th                             I saw this in the plant & decidedthat it was just fabulous. First of all, go Casper! We shall not bother you andyour machine! And next of all – if you look closely you can see that at somepoint someone added an “s” to the “he” in the last line. Feminism in themachine shop – excellent!Saturday,May 12th                                  Today we went to a birthday party for Dr. M’s aunt, whoactually did turn 80 (unlike my aunt who is still 79).

It was Sue’s birthday on Friday, so we went over tocelebrate with her & Daddy. Daddy, Sue, & I walked out to let my brother’sdogs out for a bit. I love the golf hole my dad has created. While we were meandering around, Dr. M took pictures of mydad’s irises.

Eastern Tiger Swallowtail! We’re working hard to make ouryard butterfly friendly.

I’m quite behind on reading blogs, and my plan to get ourChristmas cards out fell by the wayside (mainly because I’m in charge of theannual poem and as you might imagine the words I’d like to write aren’t exactlyfamily friendly). However, life does continue to move along and some fun andfabulous things happened this week. Sunday,November 26th         Still at the beach. I actually got out there & walked. I thought I’d be cold & didn’t actually bring anything to wear to walk on thebeach, but it turned out that these shoes worked just fine.While I was walking, Dr. M was scoping out dolphins! Our view really was quite lovely.Monday,November 27th                       We meandered home today, stopping for a bit at the CaswellBeach Lighthouse, which was decorated for the season. Tuesday,November 28th                                        Dr. M started decorating forChristmas! (Please note, this theme continues for the rest of the week.)Wednesday,November 29th                                After I got my job news on this day I thought I might bailon cantata choir practice, but I decided that a change in work didn’t have toaffect the rest of my life (especially since the change isn’t happening untilthe end of December). I was waiting for the choir to finish their Sunday musicpractice & was photobombed by Jesus!Thursday,November 30th                             I was trying to pick out abutton for a crochet project. “Here’s a nice one. Oh, I like this one evenbetter! Or maybe this one.” Yep. Far as I can tell, these are all EXACTLYALIKE. #crochet #superobservantDr. M put a wreath on the door& added one of our deep purple bows (I love purple & red at Christmas).Friday,December 1st                    I finished a crochet project. I’m playing around with making labels – not sure this is the finaldesign. Also, after a comment on Facebook about the care instructions, I addedthe addendum. Ha!That evening I went with Daddy & Sue to see a localproduction of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. It was fabulous! One of our churchmembers was the lead character, and one of my high school friends was theBaroness (hilarious because if you’ll recall, the Baroness hates children andmy friend is a local elementary school principal). While I was out galavanting, Dr. M finished decoratingoutside.Saturday,December 2nd                        Saturday morning I went to a Prayer Sister’s brunch atchurch. The food was great & the group of ladies was great! And it wasespecially nice to spend time with my BFF. That evening, Dr. M started putting lights on the tree.First he just put the boxes on there, and then he just sat the bundles oflights on there. He’s a nut.THEN he did it correctly. We love the effect in the windows.I have applied to one job, and I know that I need to startworking harder on getting a new position, but… well, hopefully I’ll get it ingear & get my resume out there to a few other places. Or maybe I’ll get theone job I’ve already applied for. Ha! What are you trying to get done thisweek?"},

Fortunately, I have some good friends and family who are in aposition to help point me in the right direction. But I’m in a bit of shock rightnow, which is why I’m doing this post before it really sinks in & I’m notable to function. Although I am GREAT at compartmentalizing, sothat might not ever happen.Things to regret: a) that Mary Kay order; b) we live towardthe bottom of a hill, so this winter it might get interesting having to driveto work; c) I’ve gotten used to sleeping later in the mornings since I don’thave a commute. Things to be thankful for: a) We have already moved back homewhere we can get the maximum support from our families; b) I have already hadmy hip surgery and it’s mostly paid for; c) I actually have been thinkingrecently that I would be more productive in an office environment instead ofworking from home. Now, let’s look back at the Time Before (I found out I didn’t have ajob):Sunday,November 19th         A Sunday collage. Firstly, I did such a great job of parkingat the nursing home that my Aunt Mimi made me take a picture of it. I know! I’mamazed too! Secondly, a Prayer of Confession to kick you in the gut. Thirdly,my lunch as I waited for choir practice. That cookie dough stuff is Fabulous. Monday,November 20th                       I had gotten into bed & realized that I hadn’t taken apicture today, so I took an “artsy” one of my comforter. The other day I flipped it over & started displaying the geometric design, becauseflowers are for spring & summer. Tuesday,November 21st                                       That time I tried to make apresent less “Shelby’sWedding from Steel Magnolias” by putting a fancy bow in it. Things wenthorribly awry.#icantparkorwrappresentsWednesday,November 22nd                                Oh noes! I hope this isn’t an advance scout! Thursday,November 23rd                            I think you guys probably allpicked out Ryan in the picture, but just in case…We had a great meal, with allthe usual food suspects. I love that our youngest member insisted on leading randomfolks around by the finger – so cute. After the meal we had a bridalshower for my nephew & his fiancé. She was mostly hilarious, but when sheopened the personalized gift from my sister-in-law she teared up & thatmade the rest of us tear up. Welcome to the Wallaces Britt!Friday,November 24th                   We drove down to the beach today. This is the view from ourbalcony. Ahhh…Saturday,November 25th                       Things I did on my beach vacation: wove in the ends of acompleted project, chilled in the shade of a ginormous umbrella that Dr. Mrigged up on the balcony, and started a new project. Here are some random beach pictures. Other than a couple ofwalks, and going out for dinner, we mostly stayed put on the balcony and enjoyeddecompressing. I love the beach this time of year! You’ll have to wait untilnext week for more photos, but for now, you should go to Dr. M’s postwith all the dogs we saw on the beach. They all had a blast, and we lovedwatching them.I hope everyone has a great week with no unpleasant shockingnews!"},

I have never been able to figure out how to load pictures onto my blog from my iPad, but today I finally found the right website with the right information. Lo and behold - the Wallace Family Thanksgiving photo!If you look closely, you’ll see a photoshopped head in there. Because although most of the meal went off really well (shocking, since I was in charge of organizing it), I forgot to assign someone to bring any drinks other than tea. My cousin’s husband Ryan went out to grab some soft drinks and wasn’t there for the family photo. I felt really bad about it, so I grabbed his head from another family gathering (hey, he still looks the same!), and plopped it into this picture. I’m pretty pleased with myself. Except for the part where I forgot about drinks...Here is the poem I read, written in May, 2011, so many of you have already read it before. I just wanted to record it here so that next year I can remember & not read it again. I decided that it had a Thanksgiving theme to it, so it was suitable.WelcomeBeggar blind man rich man foolTeacher’s pet & satan’s toolThe watchful waiting wary tooAll are welcome at the tableThe first the last the meek & mildWeakened hearts and Thursday’s childWicked warped and undefiledAll are welcome at the tableAncient crones and newborn soulsIshmael Isaac Vishnu JoeThe undecided and in the knowAll are welcome at the tableCome in come in it’s almost timeI’ll wash your feet and you wash mineEat the bread and drink the wineJust join me at the table!"},

Monday,September 25th                    I was blocking these trianglesthat I crocheted for a scarf. I was increasingly unsure about this project, butthe final result is pretty cool (see Wednesday below).The moon!Tuesday,September 26th                                   I saw these terribly cute ghostson my short walk today. Wednesday,September 27th                              Ta-da! I think it turned outpretty well. However, that yarn has some wool in it (Caron Cake in the RedVelvet colorway), and I’m not at all sure when I’ll be wearing it down here.Perhaps at the end of winter, if it’s just been sitting in a bin, I’ll have a giveaway.That evening I went to a cousin’sdaughter’s college soccer game. Friday night lights! On a Wednesday. Withsoccer. Which is actually football, right?While I was there I took thisphoto in one of the buildings. Made me all nostalgic. Thursday,September 28th                          The moon!Friday,September 29th                Another new crochet project. It didn’twork out for what I’d intended it for, but I think it will still be useful. Pictureof the finished project later. (Do you call it vaguebooking if you’re doing iton a blog?)We sat outside for a while Fridaynight, listening to the local high school football game. I’m wearing anothercrochet project. Possibly the weirdest thing I’ve ever made. I’ll show it toyou later too. Meanwhile, Dr. M was experimentingwith the camera.Saturday,September 30th                     Dr. M spent a lot of the day on the deck, to great effect.At least I think so. That last picture? WOW.  People! My last appointment with my surgeon isn’t untilFriday, but as of tomorrow I consider myself to be restriction free! Here’s totying my own shoes! Here’s to shaving my legs! Here’s to picking up that stupidsoap that’s still in the bottom of my shower after I dropped it yesterday!Huzzah! What are you excited about this week?"},

It's pretty ingenious & I may continue to use it just for the fun of using a gadget.TwoThis was a sorry state of affairs. I was in my office & dropped my grabber. Rather than ask Dr. M to pick it up for me I went into the kitchen & got our other grabber. I guess if I'd dropped that one too I would have had to call for backup.ThreeI received this bill in the mail. On the back it said: Your insurance carrier has processed your claim. The remaining balance on the account is your responsibility. I was understandably a little bit freaked out.I had been keeping an eye on the hospital bill on my insurance website, but it had not been finalized. I called my insurance company and was told that the amount that I actually owe is a little over $600. She called the hospital to find out why they sent a bill before they heard back from insurance & was told that it wasn't really a bill. It was just a notification. We both were a little bit skeptical. What do you think? Would you think this was a bill?During my pre-op hospital visit they had me go ahead & pay the amount that they thought would be due after my insurance was processed - a little over $3,000. So they actually owe me money. They sent this not-bill 18 days after my surgery. How quickly do you think they'll process my refund?Note: The care I received and the staff at the hospital was top notch. Even the food was good. However, I'm a little disappointed in the billing department at the moment!"},

No ill effects though. And Roy’s owner fenced in herback yard so he’d have a bigger area to play in. We think she got complaintsfrom some neighbors about him roaming around. Not from us though.

And Dr. M was going, “why exactlyare we here again?” (Note: I had stopped taking my narcotic much earlier in theday so I wasn’t impaired on the road – ha!)I think the hardest part of this recovery for me is going tobe that I feel so great (yes, I’m sore, but it’s not that bad) that I’ll forgetthat I still have another three weeks of not bending over too far or crossingmy legs. I need to be extra careful now because while this surgery went verywell, it “only” has a 90% success rate. So chill Ms. Bug & don’t make Dr. Mhave to tie you to a chair!"},

Usually, if a person has wildly different views of life than I do & I don't want to see his or her posts, I'll just hide that person from my news feed. But this time I decided that I just didn't need to be Facebook friends with a person who had this particular point of view. What did she post? It was one of those memes that said, in effect, no white person alive today ever owned a slave and no black person today has ever been a slave, so basically everyone just get over yourselves.As if the effects of centuries of people owning other people can be rinsed down the drain like grime after a hard day's work. As if the very institutions that undergird our nation aren't set, by default, to favor white citizens. As if the average black child in the United States today really does have the same advantages as the average white child.I read an essay the other day where a woman was talking to a black man who couldn't swim. She said that he must not have grown up around water. But he replied that his town had a pool, but that black people weren't allowed to use it. Today that town's pool most likely doesn't discriminate. But what is the legacy of this story from our (relatively) recent past? I grew up hearing that \"black people don't swim,\" as if it was a genetic disposition instead of a lack of opportunity. And this is just one example of systemic discrimination.I used to believe that once the \"older generation\" died off, the United States would become a utopia where no one was treated differently based on the color of their skin, sexual preference, gender, or nationality. I'm not that naive anymore. We can't afford to wait for some fictional utopia. We need to actively seek the change we want in the world. What does that look like for me or you? No clue. But I'm ready."},

So glad to have him back in the statesnow!Temperature scarf update(average temp each day, from March 1, 2017 – February 28, 2018). It’s going tobe huge (well, we knew that, didn’t we?). I’m 40% done & it’s almost 3 ½ feetlong. I like the cool weather colors better than the warm ones – good thingthose will be the colors on each end of the scarf. Friday,July 21st            My lunch on Friday – strawberries,bananas, apples, blueberries, peaches. It was too hot for real food. Well, forfull disclosure I must admit that I had a tuna sandwich later as an afternoon “snack.”Update on the blanket I’m making fora gift. I sewed the four panels together & now I need to do a border. Ireally don’t like sewing; therefore, I’m not very good at it. I fear thisblanket will be rather lumpy. Maybe I’ll end up keeping it after all!Saturday,July 22nd                More flowersfrom the yard – the vinca my dad gave us is thriving. And the ancestral phloxhas decided to start blooming again. Today we’re going to a reception to celebrate Daddy &Sue’s marriage. I have written a wedding toast. It’s a (bad) poem. I know youcan’t wait, but I’m not posting it until later in the week. Ha!

Sometimes they are a necessary evil.I had my hip aspiration on Monday & it was just as exciting as it sounds. But, as I said on Facebook, like all things that are dread-full, it wasn't as bad as I had feared. First, though, big props to my dad for coming to pick me up & take me to the hospital (Dr. M had to take his dad to a doctor's appointment). Daddy knew exactly where to go, where they keep the wheelchairs, and how to maneuver me around. Thanks Dad!For the procedure, they numbed the area (the Necessary Evil Needle), and then used another needle (that I could not feel) to try to draw up some fluid for testing purposes. There was no fluid to be had, so they tried another area (another NEN - but this time I could feel the probing needle a bit - ow!). They ended up putting saline in there to draw out to send to the lab. That doesn't sound like fun, but it was a bit of good news because no fluid means a smaller (or no) infection. Now my hip is a little bit more sore, and I'm waiting to talk to my doctor next week about what they found.While I sit around on my keister, Dr. M is taking care of All The Things.

{"title": "The State of the Bug, an Update", "date": "Wednesday, June 21, 2017", "text": "(Warning! Ahead there is something rarely seen on my blog: curse words!)Well heck, I actually AM Iron Man. I got a call yesterdayfrom my surgeon’s office saying that my blood work showed high levels ofchromium & cobalt (the materials in my hip device). Therecommended maximum for those metals is 3 (3 whats, I’m not sure). Mine was 5.9& 23.9, respectively. I don’t know if I would be considered to have metallosis, but theprobably is high. However, I don’t have any extreme symptoms, other than painin my hip.Next up on my agenda is a hip aspiration on Monday. Fromwhat I understand (and, I’m a little hysterical at this point, so take what Isay with a grain of salt), they stick a GINORMOUSneedle into my hip and draw out fluid to see if there is any sign ofinfection. I presume that if there is infection that would have to be treatedbefore I have surgery. I think. Really, I shouldn’t be posting these healthupdates with such a sketchy idea of what is going on. But I overshare – that’swho I am as a person. Plus, I need some moral support by other people who wouldalso be horrified by this needle business. I have a wide variety of feelings about this wholesituation. Dr. M is angry (that might be an understatement). I feel more conflicted.Should my original surgeon have performed this type of surgery on me? Aresounding hell no. No question – I was not in the least bit the rightcandidate. And I even knew that, at the time, but I trusted his judgment. So naïve. The right candidate for hipresurfacing is a young, fit, healthy man. Not a sedentary,overweight, small boned woman. Added to that, it is recommended that hipresurfacing recipients have blood testing on a regular basis to ensure that theirchromium and cobalt numbers are in a safe range. Was that even remotelymentioned to me? Again, hell no. All good reasons to be very angry at myoriginal surgeon. But, (and Dr. M is going to be annoyed with me for writing this),I am not a snowflake carried on the winter wind wherever it wills. I am aperson with the ability to manage my own healthcare and I let my own self down.During all of these years of pain I assumed that I was the faulty one, so Ididn’t delve too deeply into what might actually be wrong. But even dipping atoe into the internet within a year of my procedure I would have found thisarticle. But (again), you know, I didtry to find out what was wrong. I went to the orthopedic office two years after my surgery (after mysurgeon had retired) & asked why I had so much pain when I bent forward 90degrees or more. And the basic response was “meh.”So, I’m conflicted. Angry. Sad. Exponentially annoyed. Andcome Monday I get a big ass needle to the hip, which seems a very poor way totreat someone with so many issues. The biggest sigh ever. Here – enjoy this picture of Roy. It cheered me right up."},

And as I am already bored with that subject,instead of doing a separate post I’m just going to recap Friday’s doctor’svisit in its proper place, the Friday slot of this post. Sunday,May 14th As already discussed last week, Mother’s Day hit me a littleharder this year. It happens every now & then & is to be expected sincethis is my first year back in NC, living 10 miles from the house I grew up in. Dr. M spend some time with his pop today, and the Mother’s Dayroses were still lovely (they called them that because they usually are inbloom around Mother’s Day). My mobility just really sucks lately, so I stayedhome. Even so, had I known that my dad & Sue were spending a quiet day at home Imight have gone to harass them. Ha!After Dr. M came home I decided that I needed to get out ofthe house after all. We took a nice drive around and then brought Chinese food home fordinner. This was my fortune. Well then! Monday,May 15th               We were undecided about whetherto put the futon in the living room at the new house, but finally went ahead& ordered a new mattress for it & rearranged the room to make it fit.It is an EXCELLENT place to take a nap when you’re feeling puny – I know becauseI already tested it out. And also we decided that it was a little inhospitableto not have seating for guests. Tuesday,May 16th                               I don’t know about you, but Ipersonally think that Miss Rita is saying, “Why don’t you come upsometime and see me?” Ha!Wednesday,May 17th                      Poor Dr. M. He put a squirrelbaffle on the bird feeder, but apparently it wasn’t very baffling to our squirrels.I’m not sure if you can tell (this is a picture through the door), but thereare two squirrels on there.Squirrels: 2, Dr. M: 0Thursday,May 18th                      Dr. M and I just sitting on thedeck enjoying the evening together. Friday,May 19th        This is the face of a man who is worried about his wife. Hewas in the waiting room while I met with the orthopedic doctor. This is what Ifound out (copied from my Facebook post – sorry if you’ve already read it): Myprior hip surgery from August 2011 (a resurfacing) failed- the cup that theyput in there is now loose & tilting in the wrong direction (the source ofmy pain). Hip resurfacing can lead metal toxicity (which is why they mostlydon't even perform them anymore), so my doctor needs for me to get an MRI &have blood work done to make sure I don't have metal floating around (I am IronMan!). I don't actually think they'll find anything, but we'll see. Then afterall that's done, he'll do the revision, which will be - he kept saying - aMAJOR surgery. He doesn't know how much damage he'll find until he gets inthere, and he can't guarantee that the surgery will be entirely successful. Hehopes (hopes!) he can make both of my legs the same length (they aren't, rightnow). The surgery will be sometime in July or August (he’s booked out thatfar).Recovery might be quick or it might be several months. But Iwork from home, so I don't even care at this point. I am SO glad we movedwhen we did! I would hate for Mike to have to go through this again without anysupport. One final thought (for now): I was afraid that the doctor would say that there was nothing wrong with me. Or that there was something so wrong it couldn't be fixed. Now that I know that something was wrong, and for who knows how long, I feel really sad for the me who tried to walk without a limp, and thought she had \"failed\" physical therapy. I didn't want to go to the doctor just to be told I was imagining things & that I needed to work harder. Next time, this wheel will squeak until she's sure that everything is working properly!After that cheerful news, I needed some comfort food. Please note thatwhile I ate every bite of the soup, most of the popcorn shrimp & fries came homewith us. Saturday,May 20th           Today Daddy& Sue came by to help Dr. M clean our house. I was SO THANKFUL! Although Ihave to say that despite my view of myself as a slothful person, I had a really hard time just sitting there& watching them work! Fortunately they were only intermittently in theliving room – ha!  I didn’t take apicture of them working, so here is a picture of my temperature scarf,completed through May 19. As with the Temperature Monster fromlast year, I like the cool weather colors better than the warm weather ones.Which is fine, because when I wrap it around my neck the cool weather colorswill be on the end. That was myweek – how was yours?"},

My hip has been bothering me for a while – getting worse and worseuntil last weekend I started using my cane again, and then, all of a sudden, Ijust couldn’t really walk unassisted. Dr. M pulled my walker out of storage andI’ve become reacquainted with what a pain in the ass it is to try to doanything while using a walker. My hip resurfacing surgery was almost 6 years ago, andshould have lasted for another number of years. However, I never really didcome all the way back from it. I had days where I was pain free, but they were punctuatedby days where I was not pain free.Now I wonder if perhaps the device was never quite right, or if I did somethingto mess things up in there. Who knows, but I do know that I always expected tohave a total hip replacement someday. Maybe not this soon. And maybe thesurgeon will not recommend surgery. We shall see.But I’m really thankful: We didn’t give the walker away all those timesthat we could have.Our new house is so much bigger than our Ohiohouse – I can maneuver through it with relative ease.We live near family and I know that if we reallyneed help we can get it.I am able to work from home & fully expectto continue to work during any recovery (except for maybe I won’t try to workwhile I’m on narcotics).I can go out on our back deck with ease, andenjoy a lovely spring day in North Carolina.And penguinsare nigh, so life is pretty good, all things considered."},

I enjoyed singing the good old Easter hymns at thenursing home & then singing some new ones at the church I’ve beenattending. Then I went to lunch at my uncle & aunt’s house.

Before we moved I had been talking about graduating to a treadmill,which would give more of a workout. But the move was hard on my hip, and Ihaven’t been walking regularly, so I’m back to basics again for a while. I’mhappy to report that I actually got more than 10,000 steps on two days. Tuesday,April 18th                              Sunday & Monday were warmerthan it has been, so it was my first opportunity to use the color for the 70stemperature range in my scarf.

Not sure I like the new color very much either, but it’s atleast a little less shocking. Wednesday,April 19th                    Dinner. (That’s Dr. M’s plate –I don’t do coleslaw.)Charlie Horse – he’s living infront of the fireplace for the summer. We had to replace his Santa hat withsomething a little more seasonable.

What the heck little dude – I don’t think youcan actually get any food out of there!I mowed the yard & had beeninside for about 10 minutes when the deluge struck. This is the season ofafternoon rainstorms – I was lucky to get the yard mowed at all!Friday,April 21st       Squee! We have baby birds! OurEastern Phoebes have hatched. Also, we have a lot of these guys hanging around –five lined skinks!We went to BurgerFi again tonight. I got the veggieburger again. I love those things. Dr. M got the Conflicted Burger – it has aveggie patty & a regular hamburger patty on it. He also ordered the Cry& Fry, which came with these huge onion rings! I only ate one of them –that was practically a meal all on its own. So, the State of the Bug – about toeat an onion ring (almost) as big as my head. Saturday,April 22nd          Flowers in theyard. During theaforementioned piano excavation, I found this! I had totally forgotten aboutit. It was a gift from Dr. M’s mom.

But I did finally invest in a yarn winder and an Amish style yarn swift. It's all the fault of this lovely couple at my church in Xenia - they gave me two giant tubs of Irish wool yarn. As soon as the swift & winder arrived on Saturday I had to play with them (well, as soon as we booted Daddy & Sue out after dinner).Let's back up a minute. As you recall, I decided to do a temperature scarf for our first year in North Carolina. I chose the colors from my stash of lovely Irish wool and went to town. After 11 rows, I had this:What a mess! Why was this different than my usual yarn? That yarn comes in skeins, like so:Ah, the temperature monster palette before I knew how much orange I would be using.This Irish wool (and most fine yarn) comes in hanks, which have to be unwound before using.A bit hard to work with! The yarn swift keeps the yarn in the correct shape & tension as you use the yarn winder to make your cake. The swift takes the place of a person who could (if you could get them to) stand there with the yarn draped over their arms while you wind it.You simply thread the yarn onto the winder & the wind the crank.And then you have a lovely mess! (Darn woolly wool.)Oh, wait, then you have a lovely yarn cake!Much easier to work with, and these fit into that really weird shelf in the hall that must have been made for VHS tapes (too shallow for books).That one giant blue one is 800 yards! I just wanted to see how big I could go. The purplish color in the upper right is also 800 yards & in much more manageable cake sizes. This project, had I not made a TOTAL MESS of three of the hanks of yarn, would have taken less than two hours. As it was, Dr. M spent about two to three hours untangling one of the biggest messes, and I spent another two hours the next night on the other one.I'm pretty excited & may go through & wind up all the yarn in the house just for fun. If you'd like to see a video of this particular set in action, go here.Tonight I got caught up with the scarf. It's kind of unruly at the moment. I made it intentionally skinny because with 365 rows, I didn't think I wanted to add much more bulk.I think I might be done buying things to support my obsession. Although, now that I think about it, I saw these on Etsy & I might need them..."},

I got 3,100 steps that day – obviously I need to figure outhow to get more active again (it will most likely involve getting to theGazelle that is boxed in right now – get it? Boxed in? Heh.). Anyway, the onlypicture I took was of a pen that fell under my desk, so instead, here is anoffering from Dr. Indiana Jones. Tuesday,March 7th                            Miss Rita – still a bloomingfool. Wednesday,March 8th                    The moon!Thursday,March 9th                    Dr. M has a new toy –self-propelled this time. Hmm – I can probably increase my activity if I stealthis from him.  My weekly trip to the post office. I do not know why I didn’t take a picture ofthe terribly cute post office building, but here are a few pictures from mytrip. Friday,March 10th     You already saw most of this day’spictures. Here’s one that didn’t make the cut – Ill Penguin watching over me asI get ready to go to sleep. Someday Ill Penguin will get stowed with theChristmas things…Saturday,March 11th       Nice cozyevening in front of a fire, crocheting on a WIP (work in progress) that I’vebeen working on a while. Was I satisfied? Nope – I was bored…So I dove intomy stash of Irish wool that someone from church gave me & figured out yarnto use for a temperature scarf for our first year in North Carolina. It’s asickness, ya’ll. Ha!Have a greatweek!"},

It's not terribly exciting - just a (new normal) workday here at Bug Central.1. Ready to work! It's just a little chilly in my office in the mornings - today I thought I'd drink some hot tea. I would love to say that I had bed head, but to be quite frank, I did actually brush my hair. I think maybe I need a trim?2. Breakfast! Cheesy grits & runny eggs - yum!3. The other day I walked into the kitchen & saw this in the window - made me smile (a lot). I had mentioned to Dr. M that I wanted to put these guys in between the double panes, but I don't really have the wing span to open the window myself. So of course Dr. M did it for me. (Note, this is a little video - we'll see if it works!)4. Went out to get the mail. Just a bit breezy!5. I took a walk down our road, then I wandered into the bit of woods off of the road. Next time I need to wear my hiking boots!6. Lunch!7. My office gets a bit warm in the afternoons - the benefit of direct sunlight in my windows. I've ordered some light blocking curtains - otherwise summer might be a bit rough!8. Dr. M put together this etagere for my bathroom - he's pretty darned handy to have around. Note: I'm pretty sure that it was my phone that was tilting - not the etagere!9. Good thing it's almost 5:00 - I'm getting so sleepy...10. We watched two of the Madagascar movies - the one with the Afro Circus (hilarious!) and then this one where John Malkovich is a giant octopus. Fun Friday night in the Bug Household!How was your day?"},

It’s a bit overwhelming. Soinstead of doing any actual work, I’m writing this post. Sunday,February 26th      While packing up my office I found all of these notepads.How many notepads does one family need?Monday,February 27th           The garage was such a blessingto us while we lived in Ohio – and we were able to fit both of our cars inthere! But at this particular moment in time, it was the bane of Dr. M’sexistence.  Tuewednesday,February 28th & March 1st                             As discussed previously, neitherof us got very much sleep during these two days. They’re both a bit of a blur,and so henceforth they shall be known as Tuewednesday! I paused briefly duringall the packing to take a couple of pictures.6:00 a.m., waiting on AAA (forthe 2nd time).You’ve already seen thispicture, but it bears repeating. Torrents of rain & wind. Tornado warnings.Apparently we were bringing the storm with us? (Literally – we were driving thepath of the storm as it headed toward NC). Thursday,March 2nd                    What a difference a day makes!Dr. M had put my recliner in the carport, so I had a nice view of him workingbefore our help arrived. My dad, Sue, and my aunt Vivian worked like troopersto help us get ALL THE THINGS into the house. Then later that night my cousinKim & her husband Nathan helped with the last few things from my car. Andbrought pizza & birthday cupcakes! We were too busy for me to take apicture, but my appreciation knows no bounds.Dr. M put the girls and friendson the deck for a while (they’re inside now because temps have been in the 20sat night). Friday,March 3rd     It was my birthday! And what do manyfolks have to do on their birthdays? Renew their licenses! Dr.  M went with me so he could go ahead & gethis NC license too. He looks like a civil war soldier in his (of course). Ilook perplexed. I’ll share the pictures once we get the real licenses in themail. After that ordeal, and lunch out at a veryfancy burger place (I had the veggie burger), we headed home for a bit& then Daddy & Sue took me out for dinner. Afterward, Daddy showed usthe proper way to eat a cupcake – ha!After I got home, Dr. M & Ienjoyed the fireplace – so nice!Someone on Facebook commented that itlooked like we had already unpacked & settled in, so I had to take thispicture of the current “junk room” – still plenty of boxes left to unpack!Saturday,March 4th       Dr. M took some pictures of thelocal bird scene. I’m sorry my wordless Wednesday post confused folks – thosewere the last shots of our old birdbath in Ohio. We need to get a new one forhere.Dr. M also assembled our oldglider & enjoyed some time sitting on the deck. It’s still a little hard for me to believe that we’re actuallyhere. Tomorrow is my first day of working from my new home office. Wish meluck! Hope everyone has a great week!"},
{"title": "The Story", "date": "Saturday, March 4, 2017", "text": "For the record, we both acknowledge that mistakes were made.Opportunities lost. Incorrect paths taken. But, given all of the things thatcould have & should have, this is what actually happened.On Saturday we got the truck in the evening. On Sunday wesaid goodbye to the refrigerator (donated to my church), and our bed (donatedto a lady in town). On Monday we started putting things on the truck. Thatnight I volunteered to sleep in the recliner, but it was too awkward for me andI got about 4 hours of sleep. On Tuesday, we worked HARD. Especially Dr. M. Up and downthe ramp, lugging and pulling and toting, rearranging, offloading &reloading. It rained, hard at times. There was a thunderstorm. I worked in thehouse stuffing our belongings into whatever container I could find. We hadplanned to stay in a hotel about an hour away, and needed to get there by 2a.m. on Wednesday (we laughed when we saw that – not a problem, we thought!). At 1 a.m. Dr. M finished loading the truck and my car &took a quick shower. I was staying behind to finish cleaning. As he got readyto leave we realized that my car battery was dead. We opened the trunk to pullout the jumper cables & just stared at all the things. We were not going tounpack the car to get to those cables. Not at 1 in the morning. I told him tojust go – I would call AAA. He headed off into the wind and rain. I headed backinto the house to call AAA and the hotel (to let them know he would be late).While I waited for AAA, I cleaned. Please keep in the forefront of your mindthat I am not a good house cleaner. And that it was after one in the morning. Atone point the vacuum cleaner stopped working, and I spent about half an hourdigging into the hose with a clothes hanger, pulling out wads of carpet fluff. AAA came & started the car. I left it running for alittle while, but needed to get back to cleaning. Does one wonder why I didn’tjust leave it running while I cleaned? In retrospect, one DOES wonder.I finally finished – or I was finished. At that point, nearly5 a.m., I was drifting into a fugue state. I put (shoved, crammed) all of theremaining items into the car, and walked back into the house to say a finalgoodbye and lock up. And saw a painting on the wall. It was one that I hadbrought back from Zambia. Quite large. I might have said some words that I don’tusually say. I took it down, found a place in the car, and then locked up thehouse. My car wouldn’t start. I called AAA. I waited in the emptyhouse, sitting on the carpet I had just vacuumed, noticing all the things thathadn’t gotten cleaned. I listened to my audio book (Hamilton: the Revolution, by Lin-Manuel Miranda). I considered justsleeping in the house. But at this point, the house was my enemy. AAA came, I drove down our street for the final time, andheaded to the leasing agent to drop the keys, and then drove to Chillicothe.Through a monsoon, apparently. Wind, pouring rain, an urgent need to pee. I hadbeen awake for over 24 hours and drove 80 miles per hour. I was reminded of thetime I drove Mom & Mamaw to Victoria Falls and was trying to outrun myfatigue. I reached the hotel shortly after 8:00 a.m., had some breakfast andthen slept for 2 ½ hours. At noon, Dr. M & I headed out to drive through moretorrential rain to our new home. I felt a little tested, you know? God, Satan,Ohio, North Carolina… For or against? Expelling us? Repelling us? Drawing ushome? I do not know. We arrived at just after 7:00 p.m., slept for 10 hours,and awoke to a beautiful new beginning. Note: Dr. M is a BEAST. So strong & strong-willed –powered through pain and rain and mental calculations. By the end he hadbruises on his bruises, and could barely use his hands. I worked harder than Iever have (being a sloth by nature), but he KILLED IT. Have mercy."},

Monday,January 30th           I just got one picture of theinterior of the truck – looking pretty typical for us. We got a bigger truck than we really needed because it was the same price as the smaller one, and came with a ramp. If we'd had about four more people helping we probably could have filled it up. Dr. M set off down the roadabout 40 minutes before I did. He took these pictures. I was a good girl anddid NOT try to take pictures. (Actually, I was so involved in my audio bookthat I barely knew I was driving. Oops!)Tuesday,January 31st                           We signed the lease on the newhouse today & I took random photos of things that I found interesting –like the radio/cassette sound system (plays in the living area & the bedroom),and this super fabulous floor lamp!Wednesday,February 1st                   We unloaded the truck today. Dr.M & my 76 year old father did most of the heavy lifting. (OK, they did ALLthe heavy lifting). My dad’s a hoss! His new fiancé, Sue, helped a lot too! I was feeling pretty pleasedabout being in NC instead of Ohio. When we were loading the truck on Sunday itwas spitting snow! This was a nice change. Thursday,February 2nd   Dr. M spent some time bird watching –female cardinal and male yellow bellied sap sucker. We LOVE this tree in ourback yard! We’re about 99% sure that it’s a white oak, but we’ll see what itsleaves tell us in the spring. I didn’t take a picture of it, but we have a nicedeck where I think Dr. M will probably just live all the time. Friday,February 3rd      We built a little fire in ourfireplace.

Thursday,January 19th  Look! See that empty space on theshelf (where the one book is flopped over)? That’s what I’ve done to preparefor our move – there were some magazines there that I put into the recycle bin.Woot! Friday,January 20th     Today I drove to Indianapolis towatch my gorgeous niece Jena in a cheer competition. See? When we got there we had to sitin line for an hour and a half before they opened the doors. So I made a hat. Iloved the sign in the hallway – since I could barely get myself down on thefloor & then back up again, I’m pretty sure they didn’t need to tell me notto tumble. Oh, they were talking about the cheerleaders? If I can get a link tothe video of the performance I’ll post it later this week. P.S. See the guy behind me inthe picture?

Ivanhoe’s has 100different types of ice cream sundaes! I had #44 (Heavenly Hash).  It was heavenly. We had a lovely visit andtried (unsuccessfully) to take selfies with the Garfield statue. While I was doing that, millions of women and men weremarching all over the world, in protest of the new administration, and insolidarity with the marginalized in our society. I had a couple of coworkerswho marched in Cincinnati, including one who took her daughter, who was wearingthe hat that I had made her.  I wasn’ttoo sure about the pussy hat business (I think maybe I’m a little too fusty forit), but I have to say that it did my heart good to see the hat I made on this littlegirl."},

I'm doing Project 365 again next year! And I just this minute realized that I haven't taken a picture yet today... So, I guess I'm done with this post & off to find a subject worthy of photography.Later!"},

But we are hoping that 2017 will (at least personally) be MUCH better. As is traditional, I'm sharing our annual Christmas poem, written by Dr. M this year. What is NOT traditional is that I included a note in our cards this year. I'm sharing most of that with you as well.This isour annual Christmas poem, from hearts broken by 2016. It is a reminder of thetravails of a certain refugee family long ago, and the fears and woes of ourworld today. It is a Christmas lament, written for anyone who feels cast out,without shelter...anyone whose refuge, whose Zion, was shattered by 2016. Peaceon Earth, good will to all is our fervent prayer.Dear Friends and Family,We sat down and weptSince wesent out last year’s poem a number of things happened which made Mike write alament for our annual poem. We lost two people in his family (Aunt Helen andUncle Barry). We lost my dad’s wife Amy. The head of my department at work diedafter a very brief fight against brain cancer. Mike’s school cut severalpositions; his was one of them. My nephew Brandon deployed to Afghanistan. Mypriest is retiring next month. And Donald Trump is the new president-elect.And remembered Zion, our refugeInresponse to all of that, it feels as if our safe place, our refuge, has beenshattered – we grieve, we wail, we post epic rants on Facebook. And, we decideto move back to North Carolina, possibly in late winter or early spring. I willkeep my same job, and Mike will spend time with his father and replenish hisemotional resources. Whatever 2017 brings, we’ll face it with feet firmlyplanted on the red clay of home. The PoemBy therivers of Babylon, there we sat down,yea, wewept, when we remembered Zion.Upon thewillows in the midst thereofwe hangedup our harps. For there theythat ledus captive required of us songs,and theythat wasted us required of us mirth,saying,‘Sing us one of the songs of Zion.’ Howshall wesing the LORD'S song in a strange land?                                    Psalm 137:1-4It is aseason of lament—Unwedmother, pregnant, stunned, shunned.Oldertradesman viewed with cynical suspicionAs hecares for the living vessel of Presence.Zionshattered, they cling to each other and God.It is aseason of great worry—Newaccounting, and, always, taxes to be paid.Difficultjourneys to be taken and retakenWith noclear vision of what the future holds.Quovadis? Where are you going? Do you know?It is aseason of homelessness—In onefell day, secure shelters can vanish.Cast off,adrift, wandering, we wonder…Many ofus feel mocked, displaced, rejected.Is thereroom for us at the tables being set?It is aseason of faith leaps—A wearycouple seeking a new life, yet again.Togetherstruggling with the real, hard now,Yet everwalking hand in hand the roadBeforethem, delicate steps, but walking still.Havefaith in this season of uncertainty—Bystrange waters we have sat down and wept,All ofus, as we have mourned unsettling loss.Ourrefuge shattered, we were unable to sing.But intime, we each fetched our harps. Amen!We SHALLovercome…Mike& Dana Christmas2016"},

We stayed in the lodge & had a lovely time. Because I'm a terrible blogger these days, my pictures are hit and miss. For example, did I get a picture of the lodge itself? Nope. Ah well - we've decided that we're going to go back next year, so maybe I'll remember then.However, before you even read another sentence here you must go check out Dr. M's latest post here. It's all about our trip from Lake Cumberland to North Carolina. Such a glorious day!When we got to the lodge I took a little walk around & found a persimmon tree! You may recall my obsession with the persimmon pudding that my Aunt Marilyn makes for Thanksgiving (and yes, I had plenty this week). I was tickled to death. I didn't try to eat any of these - if you've ever eaten an unripe persimmon you will totally understand!That evening we ate in the lodge dining room. They were decorating for Christmas, and I had to laugh at the Very Special Bauble on the Christmas tree. Ha!In the morning as we ate breakfast in the dining room we were able to see the gorgeous view!Lake Cumberland is a reservoir in Kentucky & (to me anyway) resembles a dragon of some kind.Image from hereWe spent some time that day wandering around the park, checking out the local fauna.Then we headed to Cumberland Falls. And, although I enjoyed the long twisty drive to the falls, I wasn't overly impressed. Then again, I've seen Victoria Falls, so I might have set my waterfall bar a little high. But I enjoyed spending time with Dr. M, and we crossed that destination off our list.Plus, I got to see this cool bridge reflected in the water!Kentucky really is a beautiful state. There was enough fall color remaining to make all of the hills look like a watercolor painting. I recommend checking it out if you have a chance!"},

They are not surprised by this.). But I just want to say this: I got about four hours of very restless sleep last night. And as I tossed and turned, I realized that I felt the exact same way that I did when I found out that my mother's cancer had spread.

It only took three years to get to this point. I'll take a picture & share it soon (because that's who I am as a person), but today I have bits of hair everywhere & no makeup & just look really tired. So something for you to look forward to!And why am I so tired? Because BASEBALL, that's why! The Indians are up three games to two (in case you haven't been paying attention). The Cubs are headed back to Cleveland to finish the series out so we get a break tonight.In other news, I've been given the assignment of writing a poem for my dad's family's annual Thanksgiving gathering. And you know, I'm struggling with it, a bit. I haven't written any poetry worth reading in a while now, and it's a little bit hard to find the thankful with all the things going in the world right now. But a few weeks ago we sang a song at church (Now Thank We All Our God) written by a man whose life was much worse than mine is! From Wikipedia:Martin Rinkart was a Lutheran minister who came to Eilenburg, Saxony at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War. The ...city... became the refuge for political and military fugitives, but the result was overcrowding, and deadly pestilence and famine. Armies overran it three times. The Rinkart home was a refuge for the victims, even though he was often hard-pressed to provide for his own family. During the height of a severe plague in 1637, Rinkart was the only surviving pastor in Eilenburg, conducting as many as 50 funerals in a day. He performed more than 4000 funerals in that year, including that of his wife.After the war ended Rinkart wrote the hymn for a grand celebration service. So, come on, I can surely get it into gear & write something for our celebration service!Today is Halloween. And right now Dr. M is outside giving candy to short strangers. I'm hiding in the house. So, for today, our lives are pretty darned normal for us. For that, I'm thankful."},

Most of the bad news only affects my heart & other people, but still... But then last night the CUBS won their way into the WORLD SERIES! And they're going to be playing the CLEVELAND INDIANS? Does that mean that there's still hope for the world? I say yes!Therefore, since there's still hope in the world, I will share things that I did last week. First, after reading on a blog post (hi Steve!) about how many people don't really like makeup, and having been considering that I was about tired of all of that rigmarole, I decided to do a photo shoot to see if I could tell a big difference (I actually think I've done this before, but humor me).Left - all natural Bug; Right, my full complement of makeup (which took four minutes to apply, even with photo breaks after each step). I was going to show ALL the steps along the way, but since I can barely tell any difference between the first & second photos I decided to spare you. Actually, the second picture looks like I used a filter to soften up my features (or maybe it's not in focus). Verdict: I shall use makeup on a case by case basis (yes for church & work, no for the grocery store).When I wasn't peering at my face in a mirror, I crocheted (I know - shocking).Do you see that? BLUE!!!At one point during the week I ate a salad. Actually, I eat a salad almost every weekday - I took this picture because I was laughing at all the toppings. There is actually some spinach under there...Last weekend, Dr. M & I went to the Renaissance Festival. He wore one of my favorite t-shirts :)Finally, I got a lovely surprise from Rita - cards that she colored & made her self.

Put some bling in the yard & on the Daisy-mobile. 4. Grew a pokeberry bush (actually, it's been growing all summer - I just took its picture this week). I know, I know - they are quite UN ideal to have in the yard, but look - purple! I think it's lovely. Ha!5. Voted.

Also, I don't have to think about anything new to write here. Win win!We've been married 25 years, so finding just 7 pictures was quite a challenge! This first one is one I've posted many many times before, but it might be my all time favorite picture of us, from our wedding, 12/15/90.This picture is from the year after our wedding - 1991. We were at our friends Jay & Beth's wedding. I think Dr. M looks really swell in this picture!This picture is from 1991/1992ish. We used to be camping fools. I'm not sure why I'm wearing a dress, but I AM sure that my perm is ridiculous. Ha! And isn't Dr. M the cutest thing?This picture is pretty bittersweet. It was from the day of my mother's Celebration of Life service - Easter Sunday, 2005. I was determined to not wear anything that resembled mourning attire. It was a hard day. But looking back, this is another one of my favorite pictures of the two of us. I was so grateful to have Dr. M to lean on! This is another of my very favorite pictures of Dr. M and me. We went to Hilton Head for the new year, 2006. I love the beach in the middle of winter - it's just my speed. Of course, this isn't a picture of the beach - it's a picture of us in a restaurant. Very appropriate! Ha! Here's a beach picture :)2007, this was the day that Dr. M received the hood for his Ph.D. I was SO PROUD of him! But once again, I question what was up with my hair (Note: in point of fact, my hair looks very similar today - ha!).This picture is from our 25th anniversary cruise this past December. We had so much fun - we were trying to figure out ways to just live there. These past 25 years have been wonderful, hard, joyous, desperate, hilarious, so very married.

I asked oneof our members where it was located and she said that the Republicanheadquarters is currently in that space, and that it was near the cemetery. Andbecause my filter is somewhat lacking, I said, “Oh, near the liquor store!”Everyone cracked up. There are three levels of mortification here:I don’t actually drink, and my mother would be mortifiedthat I know where the liquor store is (especially since I don’t make KentuckyBourbon Fruitcake like she did – she used to try to sneak into the store at theother end of town so she wouldn’t run into anyone she knew).It’s pretty darned funny that the Republican headquartersis near the liquor store, but is it in poor taste to mention that in church?It’s actually not at all funny, and kind of a concernthat they’re putting a homeless shelter that close to a liquor store (althoughwe’ve prayed fervently for a shelter for this winter, so I’m just going to beglad that there will be one at all!).I’m sure my church members wonder what will come out of mymouth next.

Series Books (unless it’s a new series for me, I’llskip a description)Blood Salt Water (Alex Morrow #5), by Denise Mina (3 stars)The Gambit WithPerfection (The Phantom of theEarth #2), by Raeden Zen (3 stars)Brotherhood inDeath (In Death #42), by J.D.Robb (4 stars). Reading this latest “in death” book is what made me want tostart rereading the whole series – I wanted a refresher course on all thecharacters. I’m up to book #33 - almost to the point where I can remember theplot and the bad guy (or guy-ess).Yay me!The Mezzo WoreMink, The Diva Wore Diamonds, The Organist Wore Pumps, and The Countertenor Wore Garlic (TheLiturgical Mystery, books 6-10), by Mark Schweizer (4 stars for everyone!)The Catch (Vanessa Michael Munroe #4), by Taylor Stevens (4stars) The Girl in theSpider's Web (MillenniumTrilogy #4), by David Lagercrantz, Stieg Larsson (Creator), GeorgeGoulding (Translator) (3 stars)The Hidden Child  (Fjällbacka #5), by Camilla Läckberg (4stars) Leave the GraveGreen (Duncan Kincaid &Gemma James #3), by Deborah Crombie (4 stars) The GuardiansTrilogy, books 1 & 2 (Stars of Fortune, Bay of Sighs), Nora Roberts. This is Nora’s newest trilogy,about good & evil, gods, magical beings, mortals – you know, the usual. Iliked the first one better than the second one. (4 stars, 3 stars)Open and Shut (Andy Carpenter #1), by David Rosenfelt.This series is about a defense attorney, so there’s a lot of courtroom drama.But Andy is hilarious. I thoroughly enjoyed this first book in the series. (4stars)The Rest of ThemShadow Woman, by Linda Howard. This one was an accident. Iwas looking for this book,and got the Linda Howard book instead. Her books are romances tarted up asthrillers. The plot was pretty interesting – a woman involved in a top secret missionhas her memory wiped, but then it starts coming back. But meh. It didn’t helpthat I made Dr. M listen to the book on one of our trips. You know it’s badwhen you’re cringing & apologizing for the book. Ha! (2 stars)11/22/63, by Stephen King. Oh Stephen, just shut up for aminute please! This is his ginormous novel about what would have happened ifsomeone could go back in time to stop the JFK assassination. He’s such a goodwriter, and the plot was interesting, but it needed about 400 fewer pages. (3stars) The Song Remainsthe Same, by AllisonWinn Scotch. This was a book from my 2014 book a day calendar. The plot isinteresting – a woman is one of only two survivors of a plane crash, but shehas amnesia & can’t remember anything prior to waking up in the hospital.It was just ok. (3 stars)Ashley Bell (Ashley Bell #1), by Dean Koontz. “At twenty-two, Bibi Blair’s doctors tellher that she’s dying. Two days later, she’s impossibly cured. Fierce, funny,dauntless, she becomes obsessed with the idea that she was spared because sheis meant to save someone else. Someone named Ashley Bell. ...Searching forAshley Bell, ricocheting through a southern California landscape that provesstrange and malevolent in the extreme, Bibi is plunged into a world of crimeand conspiracy....”I ordinarily like Dean Koontz a lot, but this one started getting annoyingtoward the end. I enjoyed it, and love the twist in it, the by the end I justwanted everyone to shut up. Ha! (3 stars)The Liar, by Nora Roberts. “Shelby Foxworth lost her husband. Then she lost her illusions… The man who took her fromTennessee to an exclusive Philadelphia suburb left her in crippling debt. Hewas an adulterer and a liar, and when Shelby tracks down his safe-deposit box,she finds multiple IDs. The man she loved wasn’t just dead. He never reallyexisted. Shelby takes her three-year-old daughter and heads south toseek comfort in her hometown…” Just another Nora Roberts “I’m morepowerful than I thought I was” woman book. (4 stars)The Obsession, by Nora Roberts. “Naomi Bowes lost her innocence the nightshe followed her father into the woods. In freeing the girl trapped in the rootcellar, Naomi revealed the horrible extent of her father’s crimes and made himinfamous. Now a successful photographer living under the name NaomiCarson…” This one was another Nora Roberts “I Am Woman Hear Me Roar” book. (4stars) Holding Smoke, by Elle Cosimano. I read this one for book club. Theplot was interesting – a young man is in a juvenile detention center forcommitting two murders, but he has the ability to leave his body behind &explore the outside world. It was a great read, with an interesting twist. (4stars)The Storied Lifeof A. J. Fikry, by GabrielleZevin. This was also for book club. It’s about a curmudgeonly man who owns abook store on a small island. The book spans about 18 years or so, following A.J. Fikry’s life as it turns in unexpected directions. It was totally charming –or at least I was totally charmed. (5 stars) Searching forSunday: Loving, Leaving, and Finding the Church, by Rachel Held Evans. This was one of only a fewnonfiction books I read, and the only one I’m including here because I FREAKINGLOVED THIS BOOK!! She was speaking my language throughout the whole thing –raised in an evangelical tradition, the “good girl” who finally because sodisillusioned by church that she left, who is now trying to find her way backto a life lived in a faith community. Yes, yes, and yes. (5 stars)I’msorry this is so very long, but I wanted to get everything out there. I wouldpromise to post these more often in the future, but we know how that goes. Ha!"},

You can see the teal sandwiched between the two black rows in the other square.The difference is a little more glaring in person, but I'm not sure that the recipient of the blanket will notice until I point it out (and point it out I must because that's who I am as a person).Here's another little crochet project I worked on - a dishcloth & some pot scrubbies as a housewarming gift for a coworker. I made myself a pot scrubby & it works really well!

Then I realized that I had accidentally pulled out the sapphire blue yarn (that I use for the middle blanket there). No wonder the color was off! I shall make you guess which square has the wrong yarn. I think you can tell if you click on the picture. I'll reveal the answer on my next post.Happy Monday everyone - hope you have a fabulous week!"},

We really appreciate all the kind things you guys said on my last post! And meanwhile, life continues to move along. On Saturday I got most of my hair chopped off. I'm So Glad to have all that hair off of my neck!When I first started making Hello Fresh meals I was using a 10\" x 8\" cutting board. Entirely inadequate! Then Dr. M remembered that we had a really nice cutting board that we'd been using as a base for our table-top Christmas tree. So we brought that sucker in from the garage, cleaned & oiled it, and it's just the best thing ever.The other day I was mowing and G-Man had a bit of an accident. He was supposed to be guarding the sunflowers so that I didn't accidentally mow them. As I said on Facebook, \"G-Man was valiant in his effort to protect his charges from the evil lawn mower. Although he fell, the sunflowers still stand; a testament to his bravery.\" And then two days later we had a bloom! Great job G-Man!In her last post, Nance from The Dept. thereof, was talking about how she has too many tables in her house. I mentioned that we only have one table that I think of as superfluous, but that I didn't want to part with it because it was a manicure table from my grandmother's beauty shop. Plus, my sister-in-law refinished it so that it looks great. Right now it's in our bedroom with the plant from Dr. M's office on it (he had brought it home for the summer). It's kind of in the way, but I think it might just have to live there. It's Pinky's table in the winter, and after all, you do have to make sacrifices for your children. Finally, for your viewing pleasure, some gratuitous pictures of our girl that clearly show why we call her Miss Pinky Two Tone."},

The theme for the wedding was Lord of the Rings and it was so much fun (as well as so much hot!!). About half of the guests (including Dr. M) dressed in costume, and Dr. M wrote (cribbed/borrower/adapted) the service to match the theme. As is typical these days I didn't take nearly enough pictures, but I'll share what I have here, along with some of the text from the service.The wedding was truly in the middle of nowhere.Dr. M looked great. I dressed up too, but my outfit was pretty low key. I was going to wear a bodice, but it was just too darned hot for leather.InvocationSo sing all ye joyful, nowsing all together!The wind's in the tree-top, the birds in the heather;The stars are in blossom, the moon is in flower,And bright are the windows of night in her tower.Dance all ye joyful, nowdance all together!Soft is the grass, and let foot be like feather!The river is silver, the shadows are fleeting;Merry is June, and merry our meeting. (Tolkien and Dr. M)(part of the) Meditation on MarriageAlways remember that, in marriage, one never walks alone. Though thepath may be rocky and steep, and though you may not yet know the way, you walktogether. If you cannot carry each other’s burdens, as ultimately even thefaithful Samwise could not carry Frodo’s burden into the fires of Mount Doom,in the end, you CAN carry each other, even to the ends of our Earth, evenbeyond the Black Gates. So do not fear to lean on each other, to hold fast toeach other, to dive into the water even though you know, alone, you may drown. Neitherhusband nor wife lives by Lembas bread alone. We live by love. Trust in eachother; believe in each other, and together you, in love, will find a way.Though the world be full of peril, and love be mingled with grief, we have notyet written the final chapters of our quest…hope remains!(part of the) Unity Tree CeremonyNow let the song begin! Letus sing togetherOf sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather.Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,Wind on the open hill, sheep in the heather,Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water:Old Man of the Forest and the River-daughter! For all thatis gold does not glitter,And not allthose who wander are lost;The old thatis strong does not wither,And deeproots aren’t reached by the frost. (Tolkien and Dr. M)BenedictionMay it be an evening starShines down upon youMay it be if darkness fallsYour hearts will be trueThough roads go ever onAnd take you far from homeWhen the night is overcomeMay you rise to find the sunBelieve and you will find your wayA promise lives within you now (Enya and Dr. M)Our daisies from this morning"},

I'm going to share some random beach pictures in a minute, but first, words to the wise (that's me):1. Maybe you should do Project 365 because since you don't journal you'd otherwise never remember that you went back to work the same afternoon after you had your failed root canal.2. Flip flops are not good footwear. I wore them out to lunch one afternoon in Rehoboth & had an incident where one flip flop stayed put while the rest of me moved forward...and down. Skinned my knee like a little kid. And, of course, not being a youngster anymore I was pretty creaky for a couple of days. I took a picture of my knee, but decided not to share it. You're welcome.3. Dr. M & I love going to the beach, but we don't really like getting in the water, or walking in the sand, or being out in the sun all that much. Ha! So our dream vacation is a room with a balcony over the ocean & that's what we had. We left the room to eat, and each of us took one walk on the beach, but otherwise we read (me) & took pictures (Dr. M). It was blissful!These pictures aren't probably the ones I would usually share, but I'm sending these to Dr. M's dad & decided to just post them. Maybe I'll post more later. These are mostly pictures of birds and dogs - there were plenty on the beach!Osprey & LunchBlue Grosbeak CrowAnother osprey with lunch :)A fresh water pondMy one beach walkDr. M on the bayFor more beachy pictures, go to Dr. M's blog here."},

I'm up to book 16 in the series.When I dive deeply into reading books that usually means that something is going on that I want to avoid. Books are such fabulous travel agents!

At this rate I'll be at my goal weight by... Wait a minute - telling you that would tell you how many pounds I have to lose.

Ha!) Anyway, I think it's a great clock & I've enjoyed it in all of our homes. For the past several years it's been temperamental. Every time the time changed we had to replace the battery. This year, finally, it lost its mind. I guess a 25 year old clock is allowed to become senile. Dr. M performed the battery changing ritual & set the time. Later we would notice that it had reverted back to the old time. Dr. M would set it again. Again, it would lose an hour & then just stay there.

But you're getting them anyway!The first thing I do each morning is open the blinds for Ms. Pinky (and her verbena). One more month & we can put her outside! (Maybe sooner if we're feeling brave.)I downloaded an app for my phone that's supposed to help me remember to drink more water during the day. It's called Plant Nanny, and apparently my plant will die if I don't water it regularly. We'll see how well this works.Meet Dandy the Dandelion!Almost ready for church. Seems like there might be one more thing for me to do?Oh yes - hair! I was going to see if you wanted to take a guess as to how long I managed to spend the day without using a barrette (my bangs are so close to being long enough to stay tucked behind my ear!), but I actually made it for most of the day. Good hairspray!After church we had a Vestry Meeting. As Senior Warden I try to pay close attention to everything. Just kidding - I pay close attention to my crochet. Ha!Look!! I watered Dandy & she grew! I thought it was appropriate that her sprouts looked like golf clubs since the Masters was going on.After lunch (leftover pizza), I went to the grocery store and had two terrible things happen. I forgot to get my cloth bags out of the trunk AND I forgot that my trunk was full of yarn. Oops. I would have noticed the giant bins ahead of time if I'd remember to grab my bags. Oh well, I had Ben & Jerry's Phish Food to console me after I got home.I captured a screen shot of the temperature at 7:00 - for my temperature blanket. After getting SNOW on Saturday, it was nice to be back up into the green row range :)I spent the rest of the afternoon playing on my computer, crocheting, and forgetting to take pictures. Then I actually cooked real food for dinner. I had a coupon to get a good deal on my first shipment of Hello Fresh (a meal delivery company). I decided to try their vegetarian option & had three meals for two delivered on Saturday. I made the first one - Sweet Potato & Quinoa Salad. It was really good! The only problem was that the avocado was hard as a rock. a non-novice cook would have noticed in time to put it aside to use later after it ripened. But no, I kept sawing at the thing until I realized that it was pretty much inedible. Nance will be so upset to hear about this! Ah well, lesson learned!How was your Sunday?

{"title": "Absent Minded...", "date": "Friday, April 8, 2016", "text": "I've had a rough week or so.Last weekend I got a new crockpot & decided to cook oatmeal in it, overnight. The oatmeal was fine, but it turns out that it really only needed to cook about 4 hours instead of the 8 hours I gave it. I've spent this week alternately scraping, and dousing with vinegar & baking soda. Because, oh yeah, I forgot to spray the pot with cooking spray. I think today I'll make one last assault on the baked on crud & it will finally be good as new. And VERY clean.The other day, trying to be helpful, I nuked Dr. M's breakfast sandwich. Except that I must have put it on 12 minutes instead of 1 minute 20 seconds. It didn't catch fire, exactly, but it did produce a prodigious amount of smoke. The house still reeks, just a bit. Just today I decided to nuke some cinnamon & vanilla in water, then I added some peppermint, and I think that's helped a lot.Yesterday, I did my usual routine of carrying my purse, lunch bag, & crochet bag out to my car & then coming back in for my breakfast sandwich & beverage. Only, I somehow bumped the lock on the car door. So my keys, cell phone, reading glasses, and my crochet project were locked in the car. Fortunately I wasn't locked out of the house, so I just came inside & ate my breakfast while waiting on AAA. And plotted to get a second key to my car. It's one of those \"smart\" keys & the cost just seemed prohibitive. But, really, it would have been a 30 second delay to get to work instead of an hour delay. That's worth it, right?I had my annual physical yesterday & my doctor said that I was borderline hypothyroid. And one of the symptoms is impaired memory. At first I thought, well, that explains things! But, well, I've been this way my whole life. I don't pay attention - I never have. I'm in my head & ignoring cues all around me. So I don't think my thyroid is really the problem. I think that maybe practicing mindfulness would help me a lot more! Sigh.And running along in the back of my mind, and the front of my mind, is that my father is once again watching the woman he loves waste away. Amy has been admitted to hospice because her heart is only working at about 10% capacity and she's just too weak for daddy to care for her now.

It's a murder mystery, by Mark Schweizer, and the main character is the chief of police of a small NC mountain town. He is also the organist at the local Episcopal church, a millionaire, and a wannabe whodunnit author in the style of Raymond Chandler. The book I just finished, The Mezzo Work Mink, is the 6th in the series. So funny.Today I posted the last of the seven day nature challenge pictures. Here's a collage, featuring (in no particular order): Pansies from my dad's yard, a stone garden ornament from his yard, moss from Dr. M's dad's yard, Pinky McPinkerson yearning for spring, a daylily shoot from our yard, and an actual crocus from our back yard!The other day I went into the Rite Aid & did a double take. What the heck? I looked closer and these gentlemen are solar garden lights! I am so excited - totally going to go back & pick up a couple for our yard.On Thursday I posted this Throwback Thursday picture on Facebook. I love how solemn we all look. And someone should have told me to stand up straight!Yesterday I went to meet some fellow Ohio Temperature Blanket ladies, but for a variety of reasons I was the only one to show. I stayed for a bit working on another project (a special request braided cowl - she wanted pink & white). Then I went to buy more yarn. Ha!Speaking of crochet, here is square #2 of pattern #5.

While we were here at Christmas we were so glad to have spent some time with him at the last funeral. Uncle Barry was a man who always had a quick smile & funny story. We'll miss him!Dr. M's dad has surgery next week. We'll know more about his condition after that.It wasn't until Lisa's comment last week that I realized I had never updated about my shingles. That antiviral medication was a miracle drug! I had very little pain after taking it, some itching & burning, but not much, the rash didn't spread, and it was pretty much a non-event after about a week. Amazing!Dr. M decided that our room at the hotel was designed for basketball players. The dimensions are huge and the beds are SO TALL. I measured to the top of the bed is 31\" off the floor.

Jim Butcher, the #1 New York Timesbestselling author of The Dresden Files and the Codex Alera novels, conjures upa new series set in a fantastic world of noble families, steam-poweredtechnology, and magic-wielding warriors… TheBug Says: I might not have read this because I’m not really intosteampunk scifi, but since the next Harry Dresden book doesn’t come out untilMay I decided to give it a shot. I even made Dr. M listen to it when we droveto NC for Christmas. We both thoroughly enjoyedit. And I’ll read the next one too. It’s nice when an author you like startswriting another series that you also like. I gave it 4 stars.11. Career of Evil (CormoranStrike #3), by Robert Galbraith (JK Rowling). When a mysterious package isdelivered to Robin Ellacott, she is horrified to discover that it contains awoman’s severed leg. Her boss, private detective Cormoran Strike, is lesssurprised but no less alarmed. There are four people from his past who hethinks could be responsible – and Strike knows that any one of them is capableof sustained and unspeakable brutality. With the police focusing on the onesuspect Strike is increasingly sure is not the perpetrator, he and Robin takematters into their own hands, and delve into the dark and twisted worlds of theother three men. But as more horrendous acts occur, time is running out for thetwo of them… TheBug Says: I didn’t enjoy this one as much as I did the first twobooks in the series. The mystery itself was really good, and I was nicelysurprised by the culprit, but I got a little tired of the Strike/Robin potentialromance dynamic. I really am turning into a curmudgeon! I gave it 3 stars.12. Tricky Twenty-Two (StephaniePlum #22), by Janet Evanovich. Stephanie Plum might not be the world'sgreatest bounty hunter, but she knows when she's being played. Ken Globovic(aka Gobbles), hailed as the Supreme Exalted Zookeeper of the animal houseknown as Zeta fraternity, has been arrested for beating up the dean of studentsat Kiltman College. Gobbles has missed his court date and gone into hiding.People have seen him on campus, but no one will talk. Things just aren't addingup, and Stephanie can't shake the feeling that something funny is going on atthe college - and it's not just Zeta fraternity pranks. TheBug Says: I have almost given up on this series so many times,but this time I had the best time. I don’t know why, but Lula was A+ hilariousto me, and Stephanie was pretty funny too. And there was even a new & funway for her car to get destroyed! I gave it 4 stars. 13. The Curious Incident of the Dog inthe Night-Time, by Mark Haddon. Christopher JohnFrancis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and everyprime number up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no understandingof human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. And he detests the color yellow.Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, for fifteen-year-old Christophereveryday interactions and admonishments have little meaning. He lives onpatterns, rules, and a diagram kept in his pocket. Then one day, a neighbor'sdog, Wellington, is killed and his carefully constructive universe isthreatened. Christopher sets out to solve the murder in the style of hisfavourite (logical) detective, Sherlock Holmes. What follows makes for a novelthat is funny, poignant and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whosecurse and blessing are a mind that perceives the world entirely literally. TheBug Says: This was a book club book. I feel really guilty that I didn’t enjoy this book. I sort of feellike I’m kicking a puppy, but it felt like I was reading someone’s not veryinteresting diary. Which, given all that he does & discovers & causesis not at all fair on my part. My fellow book clubbers seemed to enjoy it a lotmore than I did, so if it interests you, then have at it. :) I gave it 2 stars.14. Crimson Shore (Pendergast#15), by Douglas Preston. A secret chamber. A mysterious shipwreck. Amurder in the desolate salt marshes. A seemingly straightforward private caseturns out to be much more complicated-and sinister-than Special Agent A.X.L.Pendergast ever could have anticipated. Pendergast, together with his wardConstance Greene, travels to the quaint seaside village of Exmouth,Massachusetts, to investigate the theft of a priceless wine collection. But insidethe wine cellar, they find something considerably more disturbing: a bricked-upniche that once held a crumbling skeleton. TheBug Says: Oh Pendergast you addicting devil you – you string mealong & solve the mystery, and then leave me hanging: are you alive or areyou dead? How is it possible that your brother is still alive? Or is he? Veryannoying. I gave it 4 stars :)15. The Beautiful Bureaucrat, by HelenPhillips. In a windowless building in a remote part of town, the newly employedJosephine inputs an endless string of numbers into something known only as\"The Database.\" After a long period of joblessness, she's notinclined to question her fortune, but as the days inch by and the files stackup, Josephine feels increasingly anxious in her surroundings. The office'sscarred pinkish walls take on a living quality. The drone of keyboards echoeseerily down the long halls. When one evening her husband Joseph disappears andthen returns, offering no explanation as to his whereabouts, her creepingunease shifts decidedly to dread. As other strange events build to a crescendo,the haunting truth about Josephine's work begins to take shape in her mind,even as something powerful is gathering its own form within her. She realizesthat in order to save those she holds most dear, she must penetrate aninstitution whose tentacles seem to extend to every corner of the city andbeyond. TheBug: This is another book club book. So very bizarre! I’m still not entirelysure what I think about it. The description made it sound like a corporate espionagesort of book, but it’s not like that at all. The main character seems to spendthe whole book in a sort of fog & very strange things happen to her. It waswell written, but weird. I gave it 3 stars.16. The Song of the Jubilee (ThePhantom of the Earth #1), by Raeden Zen. In the Great Commonwealth ofBeimeni, a subterranean civilization in North America, expansion long ago gaveway to peace and prosperity in the face of the history's most devastatingplague. Immortality is the reward for service and loyalty in Beimeni, a placewhere the physical blends with the metaphysical and power consolidates in thehands of those with a genetic edge. The fissures first spread slowly, thenswiftly, until now the Great Commonwealth finds itself on the brink of economicdevastation, challenged by forces from within that know its secrets and its crimes.At the center of the conflict lie the Selendias of Piscator, founders of theresistance with an uncanny connection to the zeropoint field, and the BarãoStrike Team, three researchers tasked with finding a cure to the ReassortmentStrain, the plague that nearly wiped transhumankind from the Earth. Travelingfrom the uninhabitable but pristine surface to the habitable but inhospitableunderground, this is a story about dedication to dreams, battle for survival,discovery and connection, song and celebration, undoing past misdeeds, andsacrifice for the greater good.TheBug Says: The second book in this series is my book club Kindlefreebie for February. Of course, I couldn’t just start in the middle, so I hadto read the first one too. Again, I’m not really into this type of scifi, but I’msoldiering through very bravely. Basically, some sort of virus has wiped outalmost everyone on earth, forcing the ones that remain to live underground. Thegoal is to figure out a cure so that people can move back to the surface. Butthere are plots! Intrigues! Political machinations! I’m still trying to decideif I care. I’ll let you know after I finish the next book. I gave this one 2stars.What are you reading lately?"},

{"title": "Book Review Tuesday, Part 1", "date": "Tuesday, February 23, 2016", "text": "This is Part 1 of 2 because I've read 16 books since my last Book Review Tuesday post in November. There would have been more, but I'm rereading all the Harry Potter books again (I'm on the Order of the Phoenix - Book 5 - right now).1. The Little ParisBookshop, by Nina George, Simon Pare(translator). Monsieur Perdu calls himself a literaryapothecary. From his floating bookstore in a barge on the Seine, he prescribesnovels for the hardships of life. Using his intuitive feel for the exact book areader needs, Perdu mends broken hearts and souls. The only person he can'tseem to heal through literature is himself; he's still haunted by heartbreakafter his great love disappeared. She left him with only a letter, which he hasnever opened. After Perdu is finally tempted to read the letter, hehauls anchor and departs on a mission to the south of France, hoping to makepeace with his loss and discover the end of the story. The Bug Says: I read thisone for book club and I really thought I would like it. It was nicely quirky,and the characters were somewhat interesting. But, since I’m the person whowill wander through your house looking to see if you have anything in yourdecorative boxes, I had no patiencefor Monsieur Perdu and his 20 year old unopened letter. Sorry for yourheartache dude, but it should havehappened 20 years ago! I gave it 3 stars.2. All Shall Be Well (Duncan Kincaid & Gemma James #2), by DeborahCrombie. Perhaps it is a blessing when Jasmine Dent dies in her sleep. At longlast an end has come to the suffering of a body horribly ravaged by disease. Itmay well have been suicide; she had certainly expressed her willingness tospeed the inevitable. But small inconsistencies lead her neighbor,Superintendent Duncan Kincaid of Scotland Yard, to a startling conclusion:Jasmine Dent was murdered. But if not for mercy, why would someone destroy alife already so fragile and doomed? As Kincaid and his capable and appealingassistant Sergeant Gemma James sift through the dead woman's strange history, atroubling puzzle begins to take shape -- a bizarre amalgam of good and evil, ofcharity and crime . . . and of the blinding passions that can drive the humananimal to perform cruel and inhuman acts.  The Bug Says: I enjoyed the first book in this series &decided to continue on. I’m glad I did. The ending was very surprising! I gave it 4 stars.3. BreakingBraydon (Breakingand Taking #1), by M.K. Harkins. Playboy billionaire Braydon Deckerchanges women more often than designer ties. Scarred and humiliated as ateenager, he pledged long ago to never trust a beautiful woman again. But thenhe never imagined meeting one quite like Jain Parker. Jain, a dedicatedmedical research scientist, learned early in college that her good looks were ahindrance and she’d have to tone down her beauty to be taken seriously, thus,Plain Jain was born, and men were no longer an issue. Of course, she didn’t counton running into Braydon Decker.  The Bug Says: This wasmy book club freebie, and if it looks like your typical Harlequin romance, thenyou are exactly right. As a brown eyed brunette, I was So Annoyed (ANNOYED)that Jain disguised herself as a brown eyed brunette to make herself unattractive.Urgh. I gave it 2 stars.4. Devotedin Death (In Death #41), by J.D. Robb. Ella-Looand her boyfriend, Darryl, had been separated while Darryl was a guest of thestate of Oklahoma, and now that his sentence has been served they don’t everintend to part again. Ella-Loo’s got dreams. And Darryl believes there arebetter ways to achieve your dreams than working for them. So they hit the road,and when their car breaks down in Arkansas, they make plans to take someoneelse’s. Then things get messy and they wind up killing someone—an experiencethat stokes a fierce, wild desire in Ella-Loo. A desire for Darryl. And adesire to kill again. The Bug Says: Anothergreat Eve Dallas installment – Ella-Loo & Darryl made a big mistake whenthey brought their show to NYC! I gave it 4 stars.5. Taking Tiffany (Breakingand Taking #2), by M.K. Harkins. Young socialite, Tiffany Thompson, seemsto have it all, everything but love, that is. Guarded since her high schoolboyfriend’s betrayal, she wouldn’t recognize real love if it hit her over thehead. Unless it’s a can of paint, and successful financier Todd Jameson isbehind it. Todd fell hard and fast for Tiffany a year earlier, but,unwilling to risk his own heart after a college sweetheart shattered it, heavoids Tiffany and vows to keep his distance. Fate has other plans, however,and changes both their minds. The Bug Says: OK, I knowI just read the first book in this series, and I know that I gave it 2 stars,and I know that I was really annoyed about what the main character did to makeherself unattractive, but…book #2 was free too & I sort of liked theTiffany character. But this one was meh too, so I gave it 2 stars. 6. The Wicked Will Rise (DorothyMust Die #2), by Danielle Paige. To make Oz a free land again, Amy Gummwas given a mission: remove the Tin Woodman’s heart, steal the Scarecrow’sbrain, take the Lion’s courage, and then Dorothy must die... But Dorothy stilllives. Now the Revolutionary Order of the Wicked has vanished, and mysteriousPrincess Ozma might be Amy’s only ally. As Amy learns the truth about hermission, she realizes that she’s only just scratched the surface of Oz’spast—and that Kansas, the home she couldn't wait to leave behind, may also bein danger. In a place where the line between good and evil shifts with just astrong gust of wind, who can Amy trust—and who is really Wicked? TheBug Says: This series has so much potential! But I guess I’mpast the age where I’m entertained by teenage heroines. I’ve got middle-aged hormonesgoing on – I do not want to deal with teenage ones. Plus, I was really disappointedby who was killed in this book. I spent a lot of the book just annoyed. Youknow I’ll probably read the next one though. Sigh. I gave it 3 stars7. Faceless Killers (KurtWallander #1), by Henning Mankell. One frozen January morning at 5am,Inspector Wallander responds to what he believes is a routine call-out. When hereaches the isolated farmhouse he discovers a bloodbath. An old man has beentortured and beaten to death, his wife lies barely alive beside his shatteredbody, both victims of a violence beyond reason. The woman supplies Wallanderwith his only clue: the perpetrators may have been foreign. When this is leakedto the press, it unleashes racial hatred. Kurt Wallander's life is a shambles:his wife has left him, his daughter refuses to speak to him, and even hisageing father barely tolerates him. He works tirelessly, eats badly, and drinkshis nights away in a lonely, neglected flat. But now, with winter tighteningand his activities being monitored by a tough-minded district attorney,Wallander must forget his troubles and throw himself into a battle against timeand against mounting racial hatred. TheBug Says: Here’s another one that I wanted to like, but Wallanderalso mostly annoyed me (I’m sensing a trend – maybe I’m the problem!). I realize that the book was written in 1991,but I had trouble with his attitude toward women. But the mystery itself wasinteresting, as was the role that refugee camps played – especially with today’scurrent refugee crisis. I gave it 3 stars.8. The Scam (Foxand O'Hare #4), by Janet Evanovich. Nicolas Fox is a charming con man andmaster thief on the run. Kate O’Hare is the FBI agent who is hot on his trail.At least that’s what everyone thinks. In reality, Fox and O’Hare are secretlyworking together to bring down super-criminals the law can’t touch. Criminalslike brutal casino magnate Evan Trace. Evan Trace is running a money-launderingoperation through his casino in Macau. Some of his best customers are mobsters,dictators, and global terrorists. Nick and Kate will have to go deep undercoveras high-stakes gamblers, wagering millions of dollars—and their lives—in anattempt to topple Trace’s empire. TheBug Says: This was another fun romp through Janet Evanovich’smind. As I’ve mentioned before, unlike her Stephanie Plum character, Kate O’Hareis actually a competent FBI agent. It’s nice to see a woman who can kick butt.I gave it 4 stars.What are you reading these days?"},

It would use the same charging cables as my iPhone, & since it's basically a giant phone, I already know how to navigate it. Of course, I couldn't wait until my birthday to get it, and when it arrived I was really excited until I pulled out the charging cable. Not at all the same. Turns out that I ordered an iPad 2 instead of an iPad Air 2. I just treated myself to 5 year old technology! Woo hoo! I thought I'd gotten a really good deal. Ha! But so far I like it just fine. If I were watching a lot of videos or playing games I might wish I had something newer, but I wanted it to read books and blogs and Facebook, and it's perfect for that. Church Stuff. I agreed to run for Senior Warden at church again - another 2 year term.

Tossed & turned, just knew that I'd done something terrible to my hip (you know, the one that was mostly replaced 4 1/2 years ago), cursed myself for not losing weight... It was pretty bad. The next day I realized that I didn't have any trouble walking or standing - but whenever I sat down or tried to sleep it was pretty painful. Very weird. That gradually faded mostly away & I put it down to the cold temps. But it turns out it was the opening salvo in getting shingles. After I saw all the spots on my left leg I had my suspicions, and confirmed it with a visit to urgent care this morning. Sigh. But, you know, my hip is fine, so that's good!This is actually my second bout with shingles. I had it on one hip in high school. Peering back into the murky depths of time what I remember mostly is that I had to keep some sort of salve on it & when I went back to school it was itchy & goopy under my jeans (why did I wear jeans??? because 1980?). I don't remember the horrible pain that everyone talks about. And I don't really have horrible pain right now. Let's hope it stays that way!So, moving on to my other obsession (other than my health), here are the first squares for the two blankets I'm making this year. As usual, my pictures don't really show the true colors, so I'm including some screen shots I grabbed from the internet. I'm not too sure about my choices this year, but I pre-bought all the yarn, so let's just hope I get a better feeling later.

And Dr. M will tell you, if asked, that I am OBSESSED with it. It's called a temperature blanket. The object is to check the temperature each day & crochet (or knit) one row in the color chosen for that temperature range. Here's my color chart (using leftover yarn from last year's blankets) and first three days of crocheting.I'm checking the temp at 7:00 each evening and I was SO EXCITED about today. The low is supposed to be 11 degrees & I just knew that it would be below 22 by 7:00 so I could use a new color. Sadly, it's currently 30 degrees at 5:15 & not likely to dip below 22 in the next nearly two hours. However, you know that I will keep you posted on the situation. I'm Not Really Awake Right Now: After three weeks of mostly waking up whenever the heck I wanted to, I have been very annoyed at having to be somewhere and functional for the past two mornings. This afternoon I was staring blearily at the report I was editing and had to get up and WALK for twenty minutes. That's just sad. I think that eventually I'll start getting to bed at a reasonable hour. Maybe. This is Not a Resolution: I have two fitness/weight loss challenges at work right now. One is with my department - we're being challenged to lose 6% of our body weight by April 1. We also had to come up with a personal stretch goal. I decided that my goal will be to walk an average of 2.5 miles a day. Currently I average a little over a mile a day. This challenge is why I got up to walk when I was falling asleep at my desk, so I think it's already been a success! The other challenge is a pseudo biggest loser challenge, where we put money down & have to pay $1 per pound if we gain weight. We did it in the fall & I did a fabulous job of maintaining my weight. Ha! I'm never successful at these, but I like the little niggle in the back of my head that makes me think twice before I eat ice cream. Upcoming Events: I've been afraid to see how many books I've read since the last Book Review Tuesday. Maybe in the rush to Crochet All The Things before Christmas I didn't actually read that many. We shall see. Maybe next Tuesday. (OK, I peeked - 10 books. Ulp.)OK, that's enough - what's random in your life? (Still 30 degrees at 5:37. Sigh.)"},

This is my last Project 365 post – and it’s a long onebecause I’m going through the end of the year. After 6 years the joy has wornoff & this post has become a chore to do each week. Never fear! I plan tocontinue to blog & will definitely post interesting pictures as theyhappen.Sunday,December 20th    Themoon! Andour neighbor’s house. Monday,December 21st          I went to Walmart to findChristmas cards. When I got back in the car I realized that I was just a tad windblown. Made me laugh.Tuesday,December 22nd                         My daily walk – the Tiny Little Dog/HippieVan/Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer edition.Wednesday,December 23rd                 Today we headed to NC forChristmas. Before we left town we saw these great cars. Scenery from the road…My step-mother Amy has not beendoing well, so we stayed in a hotel.Thursday,December 24th  Today we found out that Dr. M’s auntHelen died. He headed out to be with his dad, & I spent the day with Daddy& Amy & shopping with my sister-in-law B (thanks B!). We exchangedgifts with my brother’s family and Daddy & Amy that evening, but this isthe only picture I took – from my dreadmill walk at the hotel.Friday,December 25th     Today Dr. M & I went tospend the day with his dad. Here are some things we saw:That evening Dr. M fell asleepwhile I crocheted & watched Harry Potter (yes, I was still working on oneof those blasted blankets – ha!).Saturday,December 26th       Today Dr.M spent some more time with his dad while I stayed with mine & wentshopping (again) with B. You may have noticed that the country-side between mydad’s house & Dr. M’s dad’s house is just as critter-ful as our Ohio :)The moon! It was warm, rainy, & cloudy practically the wholetime we were in NC, so this is as close as we got to seeing the full moon.Sunday,December 27th    TodayI was going to meet Daddy at the nursing home to sing with him, but he calledto let me know that he was taking Amy back to the emergency room. She’s beenhaving trouble with fluid buildup hampering her ability to breathe. She’d beenin the hospital for a couple of days the week before, but the fluid had builtup again. I met them at the hospital and sat with them until they took herback. I used one of my new handy Swiss Army crochet hooks to work on a project.(Thanks B – these will come in handy!).        Ileft the hospital to go pick up Dr. M so that we could go to his aunt’sfuneral. We got to see some family at the funeral that we otherwise would havemissed on this trip, so it was a mixed blessing. That evening, I took my dailywalk by going up & down the hallways & stairwells of our hotel. They’reobviously doing some renovations. Ha!Monday,December 28th           Monday morning we met our friendsfor our annual breakfast & then we headed home to Ohio. We’ve been doingthis since 1984 - I missed one gathering because I was in Zambia. I gave theseladies the blankets I’d been making for them. I never did get a good picture ofany of the blankets, so I asked them to take pictures for me. Two of themposted pictures on Facebook. The third one doesn’t do Facebook – she needs toget with the program! Tuesday,December 29th                         Neither of us took a picturetoday! So you get my screen shot of my daily walk.Wednesday,December 30th                  My friend J made our gifts thisyear – I love the snow couple. Maybe we’ll even have some snow for themeventually!Dr. M saw a couple of chickadeesout back. They’re so cute.Thursday,December 31st I figured out a workaround for mydiscontinued yarn issue for the blanket I’m making for Dr. M and me. I finishedthe last square & got them all labeled so that I can piece them together.Better get with it – the 2016 crochet along is starting soon & I’m makingtwo more blankets!I’ve really enjoyed doing this project for 6 years. Whoknows, maybe I’ll do it again sometime. Hope everyone has a great week!"},

I’m posting a handful of pictureshere, but Dr. M is going to do a post for each day of our trip (a travelogue –thank goodness, because I probably won’t remember everything otherwise). Hereis the post that he did for our first day: Offwe go! Danabug and Dr. M's Big Adventure. You can check his page this weekfor new posts, or wait until I post the links next week. Sunday,December 13th    Todaywas our only day at sea – a very nice antidote to our crazy travel day. Thiswas our view.Webought two of the pictures that the ship photographer took. This is from dinnerin the main dining room that evening. The food was SO GOOD (it’s the number onething that people say about cruises – it’s true!). Monday,December 14th         On Monday we took a tour ofBarbados. The bus driver was maniacal. Or maybe it was all the other drivers.It was a good thing that everything was so beautiful because otherwise I wouldhave been terrified. It was exhilarating!The moon!Tuesday,December 15th                        On Tuesday we took a tour of St.Lucia. Ditto with the maniacal driver & ditto the beauty and exhilaration.One of our stops was a shop that specializes in batik. We had a demonstration &I bought one of my two souvenirs of the trip – a batik fan (the other was a bag from the airport in San Juan - I resisted buying a bag for the whole trip & then caved at the last minute).We had our anniversary dinner inthe main dining room. Another very lovely meal. Wednesday,December 16th                On Wednesday we were at Antigua.Here is our morning view.We took a tour of the island. Dittowith the maniacal driver & ditto the beauty and exhilaration. At the end ofthe tour we had the change to swim in the Caribbean. Fabulous!Thursday,December 17th  On Thursday we were at St. Maarten.We did NOT take a tour, but we did take a boat to the main part of town,wandered around & had lunch. It was HOT, and the town was basically a largejewelry store. I enjoyed my fish sandwich, but Dr. M got food poisoning fromhis meal. I’m not saying we’d never go back, but I think we’d do somethingdifferent if we did. I had brought some yarn to keep meoccupied & made this set – I was pretty sure that I was going to need itwhen we got home on Saturday (I didn’t pack any warm clothes).Friday,December 18th     On Friday we were at St. Thomas.We decided to not leave the ship. It was a lovely relaxing day. And our viewwasn’t too shabby!On my daily walk I decided totake pictures of these bizarre busts that were on each of the 10 landings.Someone on Facebook said that they look like drag queens & I have to agree.Also, my calves were a bit sore from hiking all those stairs!That evening I finished anotherproject – this one is a fall/spring cap.Saturday,December 19th       OnSaturday we headed home. We left the boat around 8:00 a.m. & got home aftermidnight. It was a long day! This is from our walk from Terminal C to TerminalF in the Chicago airport.About anhour before our last flight I finished this project. I’ve been working on itfor quite a while, between afghan squares. Home! To acold house (it was 58 degrees in the house – 23 degrees outside), and athriving Ms. Pinky.                 Hope everyone has a great week!"},

(Sorry for the even worse than usual iPhone photo - the sun was really bright!)Our fiber/yarn group from church (Heart &Hands), met at one of our member’s homes today.

I finished the last square of the orange/magenta/yellow/red one & I couldn't wait to spread all the squares out to see what they looked like.Not content with just looking at them, I decided to go ahead & put labels on them so that I know which square attaches to which other square. I can't remember who gave me the safety pin idea (or did I come up with it myself?), but I think it's going to work fabulously.Now, I just need to finish the squares for the other three blankets & I can start piecing this one together. I'm excited - both to see this project finished & to get all of these squares OUT OF THE HOUSE! :)P.S. I wrote this post on Sunday, & scheduled it to post on Friday, but here it is Thursday night & I've already pieced these squares together.

This was psychological study. It was well written, anddid not end the way I expected it to.For one thing, I ended up totally disliking Jennifer Young. I gave it 3 stars.2.  TheGirl on the Train, by Paula Hawkins. Rachel takes the same commutertrain every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past astretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her todaily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck.

It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’senough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offerswhat she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happensnext, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm thangood?The Bug Says: Thiswas another one for book club. It was a page turner for me, but in the end itleft me slightly flat. I gave it 3 stars. 3.

On a busy Dallas street, Munroe iskidnapped by an unseen opponent and thrust into an underground world wherewomen and girls are merchandise and a shadowy figure known as The Doll Makercontrols her every move. While trusted friends race to unravel where she is andwhy she was taken, everything pivots on one simple choice: Munroe must use herunique set of skills to deliver a high-profile young woman into the samenightmare that she once endured, or condemn to torture and certain death theone person she loves above all else.The Bug Says: Ididn’t enjoy this one quite as much as I did the previous 2 books. It was stillpretty darned exciting though. I gave it 3 stars.9.  The Cut (SperoLucas #1), by George Pelecanos. Spero Lucas has a new line of work. Sincehe returned home after serving in Iraq, he has been doing specialinvestigations for a defense attorney. He's good at it, and he has carved out aniche: recovering stolen property, no questions asked. His cut is fortypercent. A high-profile crime boss who has heard of Lucas's specialtyhires him to find out who has been stealing from his operation. It's thebiggest job Lucas has ever been offered, and he quickly gets a sense of what'sgoing on. But before he can close in on what's been taken, he tangles with a worldof men whose amorality and violence leave him reeling. Is any cut worth yourfamily, your lover, your life?The Bug Says: Theprotagonist in this book is a 29 year old young man who loves his mother, goesto church sometimes, and seems to go to bed with every young woman in his path(I’m exaggerating – it was just two women). It’s an interesting look at aculture I don’t usually read about. The mystery was so-so. I gave it 3 stars.I finished TheLittle Paris Bookshop today, but you'll have to wait until next time to hear what I thought about it. What are you guys reading?"},

But I realized that I don’treally have a top that goes with it. Ugh – I really hate shopping. Wonder if Ican crochet a matching top? Ha!Themoon!Monday,October 26th     My daily walk.The moon!Tuesday,October 27th                    Ms. Pinkie is still doing justfine outside, although we’ll probably bring her in next weekend.I finished up this bag I’ve beenworking on for a while. After I was done I realized that I’d attached thestraps incorrectly (I put attached them across the bag, like a shopping bag,when what I wanted to do was put them on the same side of the bag, like apurse). I may, or may not, fix that later.Wednesday,October 28th              Dr. M was excited to see theJunkyard Buck & his harem today.And then he saw THIS – wow!!The moon…Thursday,October 29th   Sights from Dr. M’s school – from thesilly to the sublime…I made another scarf in the same styleas the one from earlier in the week. You use bulky yarn so it whips up in ahurry (only 12 rounds).Friday,October 30th     Dr. M & one of his colleagueswere nominated by their Dean for Faculty Excellence awards. We enjoyed a nicemeal at the awards banquet. From Dr. M’s facebook page: “Never fear, there were more than 60 others given the awardthis year...I was one of two from my university. Still, it is nice to berecognized by your supervisors and your peers from other colleges!

{"title": "Book Review Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday, October 27, 2015", "text": "Apparently I’mgoing to make this a quarterly thing (I really do mean to do it once a month,but I’ve been feeling rather lackadaisical). I’ve read 18 books since the last time I reported back to you guys. Additionally,I listened to The Martian two more times. Yes, I read that book four times, and now Dr. M& I have seen the movie. It was pretty darn good. So anyway, I’m going todo this in installments. Here are the first nine.1. Angelmaker,by Nick Harkaway. JoeSpork spends his days fixing antique clocks. The son of infamous Londoncriminal Mathew \"Tommy Gun\" Spork, he has turned his back on hisfamily's mobster history and aims to live a quiet life. That orderly existenceis suddenly upended when Joe activates a particularly unusual clockworkmechanism. His client, Edie Banister, is more than the kindly old lady sheappears to be--she's a retired international secret agent. And the device? It'sa 1950s doomsday machine. Having triggered it, Joe now faces the wrath of boththe British government and a diabolical South Asian dictator who is also Edie'sold arch-nemesis. On the upside, Joe's got a girl: a bold receptionist namedPolly whose smarts, savvy and sex appeal may be just what he needs. With Joe'sonce-quiet world suddenly overrun by mad monks, psychopathic serial killers,scientific geniuses, and threats to the future of conscious life in theuniverse, he realizes that the only way to survive is to muster the courage tofight, help Edie complete a mission she abandoned years ago and pick up hisfather's old gun...  The Bug Says: Iwas reading this book when I wrote my last book review post, and at that time Isaid that it was rather bizarre sort of steam punk/science fiction book set inLondon (very similar to Kraken). I quiteenjoyed following Mr. Spork around England & learning about his grandfather’ssecret life. I gave it 4 stars.2.  Full Dark House (Bryant &May #1), by Christopher Fowler. Edgy, suspenseful, and darkly comic, hereis the first novel in a riveting new mystery series starring two cranky butbrilliant old detectives whose lifelong friendship was forged solving crimesfor the London Police Department's Peculiar Crimes Unit. In Full Dark House,Christopher Fowler tells the story of both their first and last case--and howalong the way the unlikely pair of crime fighters changed the face ofdetection. A present-day bombing rips through London and claims the lifeof eighty-year-old detective Arthur Bryant. For his partner John May, it meansthe end of a partnership that lasted over half-a-century and an eerie echo backto the Blitz of World War II when they first met. Desperately searching forclues to the killer's identity, May finds his old friend's notes of their veryfirst case and becomes convinced that the past has returned...with a killingvengeance. The Bug Says: Idon’t usually like books that go back & forth between the past & thepresent, but in this case I felt like the juxtaposition really worked. The twomain characters are interesting in their own rights, and the old and new mysterieswere well told. I gave the book 4 stars, and will most likely read the nextbook in the series. 3. The Red Road (Alex Morrow #4),by Denise Mina. Police detective Alex Morrow has met plenty of unsavorycharacters in her line of work, but arms dealer Mark Lynch ranks among the mostbrutal and damaged of the criminals she's known. Morrow is serving as a witnessin Lynch's trial, where the case hinges on his fingerprints found on the gunshe sells. When the investigation leads to a privileged Scottish lawyer who'sexpecting to be assassinated after a money laundering scheme goes bad, and awoman who's spying on the people who put her in jail, Morrow has her handsfull. And that's before she even gets to her family issues. The Bug Says: AlexMorrow isn’t particularly likable, and yet I really like her anyway. This isthe 4th book in the series & I enjoyed it just as much as theother three. I gave it 4 stars. 4. Dark Places, by Gillian Flynn. Libby Day was seven whenher mother and two sisters were murdered in “The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee,Kansas.” She survived—and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother,Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, the Kill Club—a secret societyobsessed with notorious crimes—locates Libby and pumps her for details. Theyhope to discover proof that may free Ben. Libby hopes to turn a profit off hertragic history: She’ll reconnect with the players from that night and reporther findings to the club—for a fee. As Libby’s search takes her from shabbyMissouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the unimaginabletruth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started—on the runfrom a killer.The Bug Says: Weread this book for book club. I didn’t much like Libby. Or Ben. But it was aninteresting premise. I gave it 3 stars.5. Birds of aFeather (Maisie Dobbs #2), by Jacqueline Winspear. It is thespring of 1930, and Maisie has been hired to find a runaway heiress. When threeof the heiress's old friends are found dead, Maisie must race to find out whowould want to kill these seemingly respectable young women before it's toolate. As Maisie investigates, she discovers that the answers lie in theunforgettable agony of the Great War.The Bug Says: Ohman, this one was gut-wrenching! Such a sad back story… but I really enjoyedthe investigative process. I gave it 4 stars.6.  A Share inDeath (Duncan Kincaid & Gemma James #1), by Deborah Crombie. Aweek's holiday in a luxurious Yorkshire time-share is just what Scotland Yard'sSuperintendent Duncan Kincaid needs. But the discovery of a body floating inthe whirlpool bath ends Kincaid's vacation before it's begun. One of his newacquaintances at Followdale House is dead; another is a killer. Despite adistinct lack of cooperation from the local constabulary, Kincaid's keen senseof duty won't allow him to ignore the heinous crime, impelling him to send forhis enthusiastic young assistant, Sergeant Gemma James. But the stakes areraised dramatically when a second murder occurs, and Kincaid and James findthemselves in a determined hunt for a fiendish felon who enjoys homicide a bittoo much.The Bug Says: I soenjoy listening to a mystery read by a narrator with a British accent :) Themystery was pretty interesting and the main characters likable – I need totrack down the next one in the series! I gave it 4 stars.7.  One Good Turn (JacksonBrodie #2), by Kate Atkinson. Two years after the events of CaseHistories left him a retired millionaire, Jackson Brodie has followedJulia, his occasional girlfriend and former client, to Edinburgh for its famoussummer arts festival. But when he witnesses a man being brutally attacked in atraffic jam - the apparent victim of an extreme case of road rage - a chain ofevents is set in motion that will pull the wife of an unscrupulous real estatetycoon, a timid but successful crime novelist, and a hardheaded female policedetective into Jackson's orbit. Suddenly out of retirement, Jackson is onceagain in the midst of several mysteries that intersect in one giant andsinister scheme.The Bug Says: Ohthat Mr. Brodie is such a fascinating man. I’ve already read book 3 in theseries too. There’s just one left – I think I’ll wait a while so I can savorit. I gave this one 4 stars.8.  TheInquisitor, by Mark Allen Smith. Geiger has a gift: he knows a lie theinstant he hears it. And in his business—called \"informationretrieval\" by its practitioners—that gift is invaluable, because truth isthe hottest thing on the market. Geiger's clients count on him to extract thetruth from even the most reluctant subjects. Unlike most of his competitors,Geiger rarely sheds blood, but he does use a variety of techniques—somephysical, many psychological—to push his subjects to a point where pain takes abackseat to fear. Because only then will they finally stop lying. One ofGeiger's rules is that he never works with children. So when his partner,former journalist Harry Boddicker, unwittingly brings in a client who demandsthat Geiger interrogate a twelve-year-old boy, Geiger responds instinctively.He rescues the boy from his captor, removes him to the safety of his New YorkCity loft, and promises to protect him from further harm. But if Geiger andHarry cannot quickly discover why the client is so desperate to learn the boy'ssecret, they themselves will become the victims of an utterly ruthlessadversary.The Bug Says: Ididn’t really enjoy reading about Geiger’s torture methods, but I did like theway being asked to “work” on a 12 year old boy caused him to have a psychic breakdown.It was interesting to watch. I gave it 3 stars.9.  The Unseen (Kreweof Hunters #5), by Heather Graham. 1800s. San Antonio, Texas: In room 207at the Longhorn Saloon, in the long shadow of the Alamo itself, a womanrenowned for her beauty was brutally murdered. Her killer was never found. Oneyear ago: In that same historic room, another woman vanished without a trace.Her blood was everywhere...but her body was never recovered. Now: In the lastmonth, San Antonio has become a dumping ground for battered bodies. All youngwomen, many of them long missing, almost all forgotten. Until now. Texas RangerLogan Raintree cannot sit by and let his city’s most vulnerable citizens beslain. So when he is approached to lead a brand-new group of elite paranormalinvestigators working the case, he has no choice but to accept the challenge.And with it, his powerful ability to commune with the dead.The Bug Says: WhenI read book 4 of this series I promised myself that I was done with it. No more!But in a moment of weakness I had a hankering for a light, fluffy, paranormalmurder mystery, and this one delivered. I gave it 3 stars. Currently (for book club) I’m listening to The Little Paris Bookshop, by NinaGeorge, about a “literary apothecary.” It’s still early days, so we will see. Onmy Kindle, (also for book club) I’m reading Breaking Braydon, by M. K. Harkins. It’s myfreebie (remember, we like to play book roulette with the free Kindleselections, just for a hoot). It’s about a billionaire playboy who meets hismatch in a woman named Jain, who “tones down her beauty” to be taken seriously.I’m making myself read a little bit every day, like medicine. I think I reallywill need a literary apothecary when I’m finished! Ha!What are you guys reading?"},

(Yes, that’s my idea of a joke – don’t worry if you don’t getit!) OK, so what have I been up to in the last 2 months?1. The Preacher,by Camilla Läckberg (Patrik Hedström #2). In the fishing community ofFjällbacka, life is remote, peaceful, and for some, tragically short. Foul playwas always suspected in the disappearance twenty years ago of two youngcampers, but their bodies were never found. But now, a young boy out playinghas confirmed the grim truth. Their remains are discovered alongside those of afresh victim, sending the tiny town into shock. Local detective PatrikHedström, expecting a baby with his girlfriend Erica, can only imagine what itis like to lose a child. When a second young girl goes missing, Hedström'sattention focuses on the Hults, a feuding clan of misfits, religious fanaticsand criminals. The suspect list is long but time is short—which of thisfamily's dark secrets will provide the vital clue? The Bug Says: Asusual, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I had already read books 1, 3 & 4. Ilike the characters, and the backstory that Läckberg always provides – these mysteriesalmost always begin many years before the actual murder takes place. I gave it4 stars. 2.  TheHundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared, by JonasJonasson. It all starts on the one-hundredth birthday of Allan Karlsson.Sitting quietly in his room in an old people’s home, he is waiting for theparty he-never-wanted-anyway to begin. The Mayor is going to be there. Thepress is going to be there. But, as it turns out, Allan is not… Slowly butsurely Allan climbs out of his bedroom window, into the flowerbed (in hisslippers) and makes his getaway. And so begins his picaresque and unlikelyjourney involving criminals, several murders, a suitcase full of cash, and incompetentpolice. As his escapades unfold, we learn something of Allan’s earlier life inwhich – remarkably – he helped to make the atom bomb, became friends withAmerican presidents, Russian tyrants, and Chinese leaders, and was aparticipant behind the scenes in many key events of the twentieth century.The Bug Says: Ilove love loved this book! I don’t know why it captivated me so, but I made Dr.M listen to it when we drove to NC just so I could listen to it again. I highlyrecommend it for pure fun. I gave it 5 stars.3. Don'tMake Me Say Goodbye: Stories, by Mary Moon. Mary Moon explores thelandscape of long-married life—the hidden hurts and disappointments that leadwomen to consider leaving, and the tender weight of shared history that promptsthem to stay. In “Into the Light,” a wife and mother finds the idea that shemight legally choose the moment of her death comforting, but how will she balancethe finality of that choice against the little joys and inevitable tragedies ofliving? And in “Missing the Boat,” a couple on a cruise vacation share verydifferent ideas of how to spend their days, with unforeseen results. MARYMOON lives in the small village of Lloyd in North Florida with her husband. Shehas four grown children and tends a very small flock of chickens andoccasionally an even smaller flock of grandsons. She blogs about her life andanything else she feels like discussing at http://blessourhearts.net. The Bug Says: Iread Mary Moon’s blog so I was interested to see what her fiction would looklike. I really enjoyed the two stories. My only complaint is that there wereonly two! We need more from her. I gave it 4 stars.4. Where'dYou Go, Bernadette, by Maria Semple. Bernadette Fox is notorious.To her Microsoft-guru husband, she's a fearlessly opinionated partner; tofellow private-school mothers in Seattle, she's a disgrace; to design mavens,she's a revolutionary architect, and to 15-year-old Bee, she is a best friendand, simply, Mom. Then Bernadette disappears. It began when Bee aced her reportcard and claimed her promised reward: a family trip to Antarctica. ButBernadette's intensifying allergy to Seattle—and people in general—has made herso agoraphobic that a virtual assistant in India now runs her most basicerrands. A trip to the end of the earth is problematic. To find her mother, Beecompiles email messages, official documents, secret correspondence—creating acompulsively readable and touching novel about misplaced genius and a motherand daughter's role in an absurd world.The Bug Says: Weread this book for book club. It was interesting, but in the end the onlycharacter I cared about was Bee. All of the adults in her life were crazyand/or annoying. I gave it 3 stars.5. The Innocent (VanessaMichael Munroe #2), by Taylor Stevens. Eight years ago, a man tookfive-year-old Hannah from her school and spirited her over the Mexican border,taking her into a world of a cult known as The Chosen. Now, the childhoodsurvivors of The Chosen turn to Vanessa Michael Munroe for help, knowing thatshe is the only chance of stealing Hannah back.The Bug Says: What’sinteresting about these Munroe books is that she is a flawed, fragile, and fierce person. The stories arefascinating, but getting inside Michael’s head is what draws me back to theseries. This particular one tackled the question of what is really a cult, and whatis it like to be a child inside those walls. I gave it 4 stars.6. Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor (JaneAusten Mysteries #1), by StephanieBarron. Readers love her as an author, now they'll embrace her as thesleuth in Stephanie Barron's new mysteries. Not long after Jane Austen arrivesat the estate of her friend, the Countess of Scargrave, her elderly husband,the Earl, succumbs to a mysterious illness. The widow then becomes the targetof some sinister accusations. Jane attempts to get to the bottom of thiscomplex puzzle, putting herself in the gravest jeopardy as she follows a trailof clues that leads all the way to the House of Lords.The Bug Says: Unlikethe last fakeJane Austen book I read in April, this one was interesting & involvedactual detective work on Jane’s part. It took a while for me to get into it,but the chapters were short, so I made myself read one each night until Ifinally had to finish the book all in one go. I will probably read the next oneat some point. I gave it 4 stars.7.  Hush Hush (TessMonaghan #12), by Laura Lippman. The award-winning New York Times bestsellingauthor … brings back private detective Tess Monaghan, introduced in the classicBaltimore Blues, in an absorbing mystery that plunges the new parent into adisturbing case involving murder and a manipulative mother. On a searing Augustday, Melisandre Harris Dawes committed the unthinkable: she left hertwo-month-old daughter locked in a car while she sat nearby on the shores ofthe Patapsco River. Melisandre was found not guilty by reason of criminalinsanity, although there was much skepticism about her mental state. Freed, sheleft the country, her husband and her two surviving children, determined tostart over. But now Melisandre has returned Baltimore to meet with her estrangedteenage daughters and wants to film the reunion for a documentary.The Bug Says: Iloved the Tess Monaghan series & was so excited to see a new book! It bothmet my expectations and disappointed me. I still love Tess and all the peoplein her life, but I didn’t really care about the mystery. The mother in the bookjust wasn’t sympathetic to me, so I felt like too much time was spent on her (Iknow, I know – she was the main character other than Tess). I gave the book 4stars (for nostalgia, mostly).8.  TheCollected Short Stories, by Dana Stabenow. Edgar-award winningauthor Dana Stabenow is best-known for her Kate Shugak novels, but the unifyingprotagonist of almost all her writing—be it crime, fantasy, horror, or sciencefiction—is Alaska. This genre-spanning collection of 16 short stories featuresfamiliar characters like Kate and Jim, Liam and Wy, and Bill and Moses, butalso ranges farther afield than many readers will expect, leaping frommodern-day Anchorage to 22nd-century Mars to the fantasy kingdom of Mnemosynea.Remarkably disparate, but indisputably Stabenow, whose fertile imagination isanything but predictable.The Bug Says: DanaStabenow is one of those authors who could make a grocery list interesting (andslightly sinister). I love her Kate Shugak series, and I loved her LiamCampbell series (too short!), so I was very happy to come across thiscollection containing stories I hadn’t read yet. There are a few extras too(including the two set int Mnemosynea that I’d love to have more of). I gave it5 stars.I would probably have had one more book to report, but Idecided that I really needed to listen to The Martianagain (well, actually, this was the first time that I listened to it – I readthe Kindle version last time). The movie is coming out in November (with MattDamon!!) and I wanted to refresh my memory with its fabulosity. It was stillfabulous. :)Currently I’m listening to Angelmaker,by Nick Harkaway. It’s a rather bizarre sort of steam punk/science fictionbook set in London (very similar to Kraken). I’mabout halfway through and totally hooked. On my Kindle, I’m reading Full DarkHouse (Bryant & May #1), by Christopher Fowler, but I just started, so I have nothing to sayabout it. What are you guys reading?"},

And I’m not talkingabout what has happened on a national scale (but I’m pretty darned happy aboutmost of it). It’s the time of year when I start apologizing for posting toomany pictures. And the sad thing is that they’re often pictures of the samethings (lilies, daisies, moon…). That is especially true this week because I amtoo sleepy to be discriminating (and after I finish this I have to go gazellebecause we were travelling today so I didn’t walk). Sunday,June 21st  Inoticed our first daylily this morning as I was leaving for church.Dr.M captured this fabulous shot. We thought it was pretty special, but apparentlythese butterflies love our daisies, as you’ll see later in the week.Themoon!Monday,June 22nd   Lilies and Rosie… Tuesday,June 23rd             Lilies again. Love that Easterlily!Dr. M stalked some water fowl.A toad!Wednesday,June 24th     For some reason this doe and rabbitmake me think of a Disney movie.See? Lovely!Lilies (those are the last ones this week).We had Relay for Life luminariesat work. I couldn’t do one for everyone in my life, but I picked five people tohonor this year. The moon!Thursday,June 25th     Last night I finished square #4 ofpattern #12, but waited until today to take its picture.After work Dr. M & I headed up toLake Erie. I caught him mid-lecture :)When we got there I took a quick walkaround the motel.Friday,June 26th Today I finished up square #4.2of pattern #12 (I had skipped one of the patterns for this particular blanketso I made two different versions of pattern #12. Isn't it wild how the same pattern looks so different when you add another color?). We headed to one of our favoritelakeside parks to sit and crochet (me) & take pictures (Dr. M). But therewas a roadblock.I took a walk before I settledin to crochet. I noticed that it was pretty windy & the lake was verysplashy (technical term). Cue sinister music!After hanging out there for awhile we visited “our” lighthouse at Marblehead. Here are a handful of Dr. M’spictures from the day.It was a good day!And I finished square #1 ofpattern #13!Saturday,June 27th                We knewthat it was going to rain today & had planned to do some shopping &indoor activities. But there was a LOT of rain and a LOT of wind & thereended up being flooding & power outages.Wedecided to drive out to some of our favorite wetland areas since it was alreadyso wet. Of course, I went charging off down the path only to find it blocked.But it was a beautiful drive – lots of birds and dramatic skies. When wegot back to our motel we discovered that our parking lot was ankle deep inwater! Dr. M dropped me off & then parked the Bugly in a dry(ish) spot & slogged back to our room(thanks sweetie!). And we spent the night listening to the wind & beinggrateful for our 2nd floor room. (Side note: The hotel actuallycalled our home phone at 9:00 p.m. to say they were relocating folks, but wehad checked our voicemail earlier in the evening & didn’t get the messageuntil we got back home. And then when Dr. M checked out this morning, theperson at the front desk said that they’d checked us out last night. So we weresquatting! Ha! But we were warm & dry & the view of the crazy lake waswell worth the slog through the parking lot).                 To be continued...Hope everyone has a great week!"},
{"title": "So What's Pinterest All About Anyway?", "date": "Tuesday, June 23, 2015", "text": "There are two kinds of people in this world: Those who embrace the Pinterest & those who are still scratching their heads about it. I'm a modified embracer. I shall explain.Pinterest is the digital equivalent of a wishbook. Remember cutting home decor ideas out of a magazine & pasting them in a scrapbook? Or keeping a folder of household cleaning tips? Me either. (If you visited my home you would probably say that perhaps I could have benefited from such a wishbook.) Anyway, Pinterest is a place to go look for ideas and also a place to save an idea when you come across it on the world wide web. I mostly do the latter.Here is what the home page looks like when I log on:If I wanted to, I could just keep scrolling down & looking at stuff. Or I could search for something in particular. But Pinterest, like Wikipedia, is created by the masses. If you see something that interests you and you click on it, the link may or may not take you somewhere helpful. I mostly ignore this page (although isn't that baby hat adorable?).Here is MY page, with my boards (folders):As you can see, I had so many links to crochet patterns that I had to split them up. So, how do these pictures get here? I come across something of interest (let's face it, it usually involves yarn). I think to myself, \"Self, I would like to make this hat/scarf/blanket later.\" So I click on the little Pinterest symbol on my toolbar :And a window pops up asking me which board I want to put it on:Then later I go into Pinterest to my boards, and select the one I want (here is my scarves board):I scroll down until I find the one I want & click on it. That takes me to the original website which has the pattern:Back in the bad old days I had dozens of links to things I wanted to keep, saved as bookmarks on Internet Explorer (those WERE the bad old days!). Which was fine for articles or exercise tips - I could name the bookmark well enough to know what it was. But once I started collecting crochet patterns, without a picture attached, I would usually have to click on each one to find the one I wanted. I mean, really, I'm supposed to remember what the Dazzle Scarf looks like six months from now?Pinterest, as a repository for all my crochet patterns of interest, works really well for me. And saves paper too - I can access it on my phone & pull up a pattern on the fly wherever I am. And frankly, that has been the biggest selling point for me, especially with all of these granny squares I'm making. I can pull up the pattern wherever I am & see how mine compares to the original.Clear as mud? Did I convince you of its worth?"},

Also, if you’ll remember from the pictures Iposted last week I saw a fawn in the cemetery. Well, today I saw three deer. I’m enjoying my walks there,even though one of the deer stomped her foot at me. Monday,June 8th  Speaking of deer, Dr. M saw a coupleon his way to school today.

I think I got it because they can’t getrid of me. Heh.Now I’m onto something new (andno, the shawl is not done): Preemie hats! So tiny! Our local hospital uses 50 aweek (a month? Something crazy). As you might imagine, they go very quickly, soI’m going to try to do several a week.   Saturday,June13th                Icrocheted another hat while we were driving up to Dr M’s school for agraduation party (for one of his high schoolers who’ve been taking collegeclasses at his school).On ourway home we stopped for groceries & I saw these.

The swing frame is reinforced by a large rusty C-clamp (actually more of a D-clamp), the old awning frame is held together with duct tape, and the extended awning is supported by an antique tobacco stick and held in place by clothespins and a hair thingamabob. At Bedwetter Irascible Awnings, it's the little things that matter, such as our aforementioned decorative yet functional front clip,our quick-release pins for the awning extension flaps, which allow you to compensate for late-afternoon sun angles,  and our up-cycled, accented wood support for the awning extension! Note also that your safety is top priority, as evidenced in the rusty clamp (hey, you know it's steel if it rusts like that!) and the extensive use of top-quality tape to maintain your awning frame's integrity. And while you're looking at the details, note the perfectly distressed quality of our awning material! With each one literally years in the making, we think we offer the most distinct awnings in the industry!Bedwetter Awnings now come with Kewl Blu liners, with NASA approved reflective technology! The \"space blanket\" was developed in 1964 as a part of the Apollo program. This is the \"emergency blanket\" version...coated with reflective material on one side to hold in body heat in situations where hypothermia is a possibility. Inversely, it makes for a nice shelter half, is mostly waterproof, and makes for some cool shade with the reflective side up. There you have it folks - the latest in shade technology. You know you want one! But better hurry - these babies will be jumping off the shelves! Or falling..."},

{"title": "Book Review Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday, May 5, 2015", "text": "In the month since I last posted I’ve read 7 books. 1. DeathComes to Pemberley, by P.D. James. It is 1803, six yearssince Elizabeth and Darcy embarked on their life together at Pemberley, Darcy'smagnificent estate. Their peaceful, orderly world seems almost unassailable.Elizabeth has found her footing as the chatelaine of the great house. They havetwo fine sons, Fitzwilliam and Charles. Elizabeth's sister Jane and herhusband, Bingley, live nearby; her father visits often; there is optimistictalk about the prospects of marriage for Darcy's sister Georgiana. Andpreparations are under way for their much-anticipated annual autumn ball. Then,on the eve of the ball, the patrician idyll is shattered. A coach careens upthe drive carrying Lydia, Elizabeth's disgraced sister, who with her husband,the very dubious Wickham, has been banned from Pemberley. She stumbles out ofthe carriage, hysterical, shrieking that Wickham has been murdered. Withshocking suddenness, Pemberley is plunged into a frightening mystery. Inspiredby a lifelong passion for Austen, P. D. James masterfully re-creates the world of\"Pride and Prejudice,\" electrifying it with the excitement andsuspense of a brilliantly crafted crime story, as only she can write it. The Bug Says: Ireally wanted to love this book. And there were aspects that I did enjoy – itwas fun to revisit the Pride andPrejudice characters. But the mystery was REALLY lame. I guess I thought itmight be more Holmesian, but no one seemed to actually try to solve themystery. I gave it 3 stars. 2.  The ShellGame (Fox and O'Hare 0.25), by Janet Evanovich & LeeGoldberg. Con man Nick Fox is after Garson Klepper’s golden Peruvian relics.For Fox, convincing Klepper to hire him as security for the relocation of therelics to the Getty museum in L.A. was easy. Problem is, Fox wasn’t planning onKlepper also enlisting the help of the FBI. Fox also wasn’t planning on beingpaired up with rookie special agent Kate O’Hare. She’s smart, she’s tenacious,and when she’s conned, she holds a grudge. Life for Fox and O’Hare will neverbe the same again.The Bug Says: Thisis a prequel to the other Fox & O’Hare books that I’ve already read. It wasreally just a short story & was pretty cute. Janet Evanovich is the queenof the wacky woman (Stephanie Plum), but Kate O’Hare is actually competent ather job. Light & fluffy – I gave it 3 stars.3. TheComplaints (Malcolm Fox #1),by Ian Rankin. Nobody likes The Complaints - they're the cops whoinvestigate other cops. It's where Malcolm Fox works. He's just had a result,and should be feeling good about himself, but he's a man with problems: his newjob is Jamie Breck, a dirty cop but no one can prove it. As Fox takes on thejob, he learns that there's more to Breck than anyone thinks. The Bug Says: Thiswas a fine well written mystery with some interesting twists. I’m planning toread the next one when I can get to it. I gave it 4 stars. 4. The RosieEffect (Don Tillman #2), by Graeme Simsion. GREETINGS. Myname is Don Tillman. I am forty-one years old. I have been married to RosieJarman, world's most perfect woman, for ten months and ten days. Marriage addedsignificant complexity to my life. When we relocated to New York City, Rosiebrought three maximum-size suitcases. We abandoned the Standardised Meal Systemand agreed that sex should not be scheduled in advance. Then Rosie told me wehad 'something to celebrate', and I was faced with a challenge even greaterthan finding a partner. I have attempted to follow traditional protocols andhave sourced advice from all six of my friends, plus a therapist and theinternet. The result has been a web of deceit. I am now in danger ofprosecution, deportation and professional disgrace. The Bug Says: Ilove Don Tillman. You’ll recall that I read the first book in the series lastmonth for book club. We all enjoyed it so much that we made this one our Aprilbook. I found myself laughing out loud a number of times. And I listened to theaudio version, so it was really fun hearing the Australian narrator. I gave it4 stars.5. Thundersword (GuardiansInc. #2), by Julian Rosado-Machain. The search for the Book of Concord ison the brink of failure. Guardians Inc. can’t move without being followedby the Azure Guard, and the balance between Magic and Technology has begun toshift giving Magical creatures a stronger hold in our world. With newenemies arising and old alliances breaking up, the Guardians need an urgentvictory or the seven thousand year old plan will fail and a new Dark Age willengulf the world. But just as Thomas Byrne begins to discover the innerworkings of Guardians Inc. and his place as a Cypher, he also finds out thatnot everything is as he thought inside the company and that the worst enemymight be the one lurking within.The Bug Says: Iread the first book in this series as my free Kindle book for book club. It hada lot of typos, but the story was somewhat interesting, so I decided to readthe second book. Different typos, somewhat more interesting story, so unlikethe first one (which got 2 stars), I gave this one 3 stars.6. BlueLabyrinth (Pendergast #14),by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child. A long-buriedfamily secret resurfaces when one of Aloysius Pendergast’s most implacableenemies shows up on his doorstep as a murdered corpse. The mystery has all thehallmarks of the perfect murder, save for an enigmatic clue: a piece ofturquoise lodged in the stomach of the deceased. The gem leads Pendergast to anabandoned mine on the shore of California s desolate Salton Sea, which in turnpropels him on a journey of discovery deep into his family’s sinister past. ButPendergast learns there is more at work than a ghastly episode of familyhistory. He is soon being stalked by a subtle killer bent on vengeance over anancient transgression. In short order, Pendergast is caught in a wickedlyclever plot, which will leave him stricken in mind and body and may well endwith his death.The Bug Says: Withthis book we are back to more familiar Pendergast ground. I enjoyed it quite abit when I wasn’t being grossed out – don’t eat while reading these books!  I listened to the audio book & on my wayto work one morning didn’t take my own advice. I gave it 4 stars.Evidence of me not taking my own advice7.  The Four Legged Prophet, (GuardiansInc. #3), by Julian Rosado-Machain. Both Magical and Mundane worlds haverallied around Cypher Thomas Byrne and a new pact between the Faun Clans andthe Guardians gives hope that the World will be safe for everyone, human ornot, and even a truce with the Warmaster might be within reach. But, do theGuardians really want it? \"...and the Four-Legged Prophet will deliver usto darkness . . .\" With Thomas searching for his parents, the enemies ofGuardians Inc. apparently in retreat and peace seemingly within reach, the mosturgent question will be: Who is the Four Legged Prophet?The Bug Says: Soyes, I had to read the next book in the series. I liked it the best of thethree – very interesting twist at the end. The 4th book isn’t outyet & I’m not sure if I’ll read it once it’s available. We’ll see. This onehad just as many typos as the other two, so it gets 3 stars too.Currently I’m listening to The Preacher, by Camilla Läckberg, a Swedish police procedural(this is book # 2 in the series, but I’ve actually read ahead – when I finish I’llbe ready to move onto book #5). And for book club I’m reading The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out ofthe Window and Disappeared, by Jonas Jonasson, which bizarrely enoughis also set in Sweden! What are you guys reading?"},

I liked (VERY MUCH) that the lead badass characterwas a woman, and I enjoyed reading about her past & what shaped her. I gaveit 4 stars, and I have book 2 in my queue… 9. Innocentin Las Vegas (Tiffany Black Mystery #1), by A.R. Winters. Cupcake-lovingcroupier Tiffany Black is determined to leave her job at the casino for good.She's one small step away from acquiring her Private Investigator license, andhas her eye on the prize.

Absolute total Stephanie Plumknockoff. It was light & fluffy, and I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn’tbeen saying, “Oh yeah, that’s just like Stephanie,” every other page. I gave it3 stars.10. Case Histories (JacksonBrodie #1), by Kate Atkinson. Case one: A little girl goesmissing in the night. Case two: A beautiful young office worker fallsvictim to a maniac's apparently random attack. Case three: A newmother finds herself trapped in a hell of her own making - with a very needybaby and a very demanding husband - until a fit of rage creates a grisly, bloodyescape. Thirty years after the first incident, as private investigator JacksonBrodie begins investigating all three cases, startling connections anddiscoveries emerge . . .The Bug Says: Ihad read Life After Life by KateAtkinson & loved it so much that when I saw this book on my book a daycalendar I decided to give it a whirl. I really enjoyed it. She’s an excellentwriter, and this genre is right down my alley. I gave it 5 stars.11.  Maisie Dobbs (MaisieDobbs #1), by Jacqueline Winspear. Maisie Dobbs isn’t just anyyoung housemaid. Through her own natural intelligence — and the patronage ofher benevolent employers — she works her way into college at Cambridge. WhenWorld War I breaks out, Maisie goes to the front as a nurse.

I thoroughlyenjoyed it & can’t wait to read the next one! I gave it 4 stars.12. The RosieProject (Don Tillman #1), by Graeme Simsion. Narrator DonTillman 39, Melbourne genetics prof and Gregory Peck lookalike, sets a 16-pagequestionnaire The Wife Project to find a non-smoker, non-drinkerideal match. But Rosie and her Father Project supersede. The spontaneousalways-late smoker-drinker wants to find her biological father. She resets hisclock, throws off his schedule, and turns his life topsy-turvy.The Bug Says: Thiswas our “real” book for March book club. At first I was a little uncomfortablewith the subject matter, but after a bit I realized that the main character waspretty much in charge of his life in the way that he found acceptable, so Irelaxed my PC vigilance. It was a lot of fun, and we’re going to read thesecond book in the series for April. I gave it 4 stars. 13. The Escape (JohnPuller #3), by David Baldacci. John Puller’s older brother,Robert, was convicted of treason and national security crimes. His inexplicableescape from prison makes him the most wanted criminal in the country. Some inthe government believe that John Puller represents their best chance atcapturing Robert alive, and so Puller takes on the burden of bringing hisbrother in to face justice.The Bug Says: OhDavid, David, David – why can’t I just quit you? Your men are ridiculouslyhonorable and manly men (when they’re not sniveling weasly men), and yourwomen, while capable, are formulaic. I started out listening to the audioversion of the book, but oh man the narrators are terrible, so I switched tothe Kindle version. The story is actually pretty interesting, but even so Igave it 2 stars. And you know I’ll read John Puller #4 if there is one. Sigh.14. A VerySad Letter: The True Story of an American Pioneer Woman and the AbosoluteDespair She Endured - In Her Own Words, by Paul Kroeze. Read theheartbreaking true letter sent in 1876 from aunt Sara Olds to her niece MatildaAnn Hoteling describing the sacrifices she endured in trying to save her youngdaughter. Learn what Sara Olds did when another child took ill on a wagon tripfrom Colorado to Kansas. Also follow Madilda Ann Hoteling and see how she useda teaching certificate to explore and become one of the earliest teachers tosettle in the American Northwest. These were two amazing women, both set ondifferent paths who both touched on American history.The Bug Says: Thiswas my Kindle freebie for April book club. And I just noticed the typo in thetitle (yes, it does appear that way on the book cover too). The pretty much holdstrue throughout the whole (16 page) book. The author (a descendant of AuntSara) says that he added punctuation to her letter, but I couldn’t really tell.Then he rambled on a bit about the niece Matilda – who actually was a fascinating woman. The excerptsfrom her writing were the most well written parts of the book. I gave it 2 stars."},

On Saturdays I have half a brain :)In the 8 weeks since I last posted I’ve read fourteen (14!) books. Granted, some of them werepretty short, but still… I do recall some late night reading. A number of thebooks were recommended on my book a day calendar from last year – I had savedup the ones that looked interesting for times when I wanted somethingdifferent. So there’s a little more variety than usual.[Editor’s Note: I can’tinflict 14 books on you at once! I’m just going to post 7 today & the restnext Tuesday. You’re welcome.]1. The Cypher (GuardiansInc. #1), by Julian Rosado-Machain. This book is two storiesin one. A glimpse into a multinational company that is in reality the oldest ofsecret societies … guiding and protecting humanity from creatures and forcesthat most of us believe are only mythology and fairy tales. The other is thestory of Thomas Byrne, a young man thrust into secrets he shouldn't be aware ofand dangers he shouldn't face, but that he ultimately will, for he is a Cypher.The only one who can steer humanity's future. The ultimate conspiracy theory isthat Magic is real. Kept in check by technology, but every five hundred yearsthe balance can shift and, if it does, technology will fail and those creatureswe've driven into myth will come back with a vengeance.The Bug Says: Thiswas my Kindle freebie for book club for February. The story was prettyinteresting – although it was yet another case of a boy saving the world. Don’t girls ever get to be heroes too?Unfortunately, being self-published, it was full of typos & such, so I gaveit 2 stars. I’m reading the second book in the series right now. I’m going totry to power past the typos & enjoy the story. We shall see how it goes.2.  Sycamore Row (JakeBrigance #2), by John Grisham. Seth Hubbard is a wealthy man dyingof lung cancer. He trusts no one. Before he hangs himself from a sycamore tree,Hubbard leaves a new, handwritten, will. It is an act that drags his adultchildren, his black maid, and Jake into a conflict as riveting and dramatic asthe murder trial that made Brigance one of Ford County's most notoriouscitizens, just three years earlier. The second will raises far morequestions than it answers. Why would Hubbard leave nearly all of his fortune tohis maid? Had chemotherapy and painkillers affected his ability to thinkclearly? And what does it all have to do with a piece of land once known asSycamore Row?The Bug Says: Ilistened to this one on audio – I loved the southern accent of the narrator.And I really really wanted to love the book. It’s the first Grisham book I’veread in a while. The main character was in the very popular A Time to Kill (you might remember that MatthewMcConaughey & Sandra Bullock were in the movie version). But this bookwas very formulaic. I just was never really drawn in by the characters. And, Ican’t believe I’m saying this, it was just too feel-good for a Grisham book. Igave it 3 stars.3. Obsessionin Death (In Death #40), by J.D. Robb. Eve Dallas has becomethe object of one person’s obsession. Someone who finds her extraordinary, andthinks about her every hour of every day. Who believes the two of them have aspecial relationship. Who would kill for her — again and again...The Bug Says: Ican’t believe we’re 40 books into this series! A few books ago I was wonderingif the magic was fading, but the last several have been great (to me anyway). Igave it 4 stars. 4. WhatHappened to Cass McBride? by Gail Giles. Kyle Kirby has planned acruel and unusual revenge on Cass McBride, the most popular girl in school, forthe death of his brother David. He digs a hole. Drugs Cass. Kidnaps her. Putsher in a box-underground. He buries her alive. But Kyle makes a fatal error:Cass knows the power of words. She uses fear as her weapon to keep her nemesistalking - and to keep herself breathing during the most harrowing 48 hours ofher life. The Bug Says: Ifound the book interesting, although by the end of it the only character Ireally liked was David, and since he was dead… The older brother wasself-centered & slightly psychopathic, and Cass was what (I imagine) mostteenage girls are like. By the end, neither of them had much of my sympathy! Igave the book 3 stars.5. A MonsterCalls, by Patrick Ness, Jim Kay (Illustrator), Siobhan Dowd (Conception). The monster showed upafter midnight. As they do. But it isn't the monster Conor's been expecting.He's been expecting the one from his nightmare, the one he's had nearly everynight since his mother started her treatments, the one with the darkness andthe wind and the screaming... This monster is something different, though.Something ancient, something wild. And it wants the most dangerous thing of allfrom Conor.The Bug Says: Whatan interesting way to tackle a very painful subject! I won’t give away what themonster is after, but I will say that it was a really good look at all theemotions involved when a teenager goes up against something he thinks he can’thandle. I gave it 4 stars.6. Gods andBeasts: An Alex Morrow Novel (Alex Morrow #3), by Denise Mina. It’sthe week before Christmas when a lone robber bursts into a busy Glasgow postoffice carrying an AK47. An elderly man suddenly hands his younggrandson to a stranger and wordlessly helps the gunman fill bags with cash,then carries them to the door. He opens the door and bows his head; the robberfires off the AK47, tearing the grandfather in two. DS Alex Morrowarrives on the scene and finds that the alarm system had been disabled beforethe robbery. Yet upon investigation, none of the employees can be linked to thegunman. And the grandfather—a lifelong campaigner for social justice—is above reproach. As Morrow searches for the killer, shediscovers a hidden, sinister political network. Soon it is chillingly clear: nocorner of the city is safe, and her involvement will go deeper than she couldever have imagined. The Bug Says: OhI love me some Alex Morrow! So much more than a police procedural. Denise Minais one of my new favorite authors. I gave it 4 stars.7.  TheUninvited Guests, by Sadie Jones. One late spring evening in 1912,in the kitchens at Sterne, preparations begin for an elegant supper party inhonour of Emerald Torrington's twentieth birthday. But only a few miles away, adreadful accident propels a crowd of mysterious and not altogether savourysurvivors to seek shelter at the ramshackle manor - and the household is throwninto confusion and mischief. One of their number (who is most definitely not agentleman) makes it his business to join the birthday revels. Evening turns tostormy night, and a most unpleasant game threatens to blow respectability tosmithereens: Smudge Torrington, the wayward youngest daughter of the house,decides that this is the perfect moment for her Great Undertaking. The Bug Says: Ittook me a minute to figure out what the heck was happening in this verycharming book. After I finished it I decided that it was a cross between Pride & Prejudice & Rocky Horror Picture Show. A LOT of fun!I have it 4 stars."},

Heh.Dr. M got some great pictures of ablue heron in flight. Go to his blog hereto see more.Friday,March 27th  Tree, or Ent – you make thecall. Fish & Chips Friday – yum!Saturday,March 28th            I didn’thave anything I needed to do today – such a nice feeling! So I spent some timewatching spring training baseball & crocheting.Well, we did have one thing to do – we attended aplay at Dr. M’s university. It was very well done – and educational.

I think this is the first time in several years(although I guess I could share my screen shot of my daily walk on thegazelle). However, I do have a couple of pictures to share – Dr. M gave alecture at his university as part of a new installation there about the dustbowl. Good job sweetie!Wednesday,March 18thI had a busy day – work, then ameeting with our Rector, then this worship team meeting. Choir practiceafterward…While I was at the meeting Ifinished this scrubbydishcloth. I’m not sure about how effective it will be, but it was a LOT offun to make.That evening I thought this prayerfor a Wednesday in Lent was especially relevant. Thursday,March 19th   Not content with the scrubby Idecided to make a bathpouf. I’ve already used this & I would like to note that perhapswashing it first would have been a good idea – it was alarming to see theshower water run red.

Although I would also like to get another piercing inone of my ears I don’t think I’ll use his method.Friday,March 20th  Early morning on campus –were-deer!Here they are in the light ofday…I started a new afghan square.The middle of it is pretty unusual – basically you crochet all these short rows& then sew it together to get a circle. I was skeptical until I tried it.Interesting!Saturday,March 21st           Crow!!Dr. M wasin his happy place out on the swing, so I had to join him.My dailywalk – I pushed myself to go further than usual.

I wandered around his property.Then we sat around for a whilejust talking about nothing in particular. Can you see the two cats in thebottom right picture?And then we decided to take a swing that Dr. M’s dad had made a numberof years ago. I’ll be excited to sit in it this spring & summer. It’s funny– we’ve been trying to bring my car (Daisy) on long trips, but this time Dr. Mwanted to bring the Bugly. I guess now we know why!Cool sky on our way back toDaddy & Amy’s house.Thursday,March 12th   Daddy & I went to a local parkinglot to take my daily walk. This plant grows in my dad’s yard inthe winter – one or two leaves come up every year. There are never any blooms.Facebook seemed to think it’s trillium – what does blogland say?            Friday,March 13th  We headed home today and tookour usual short detour to check out the critters.We stopped at Tamarack &wandered around so I could get my daily walk. We called the sculpture “B.O. Man”– but if you read what it’s about it’s actually very powerful.Saturday,March 14th          Dr. Msprained his ankle while we were in NC (a dream battle involving the Simpsons +and a bed too near the wall = crunched ankle). Anyway, he was supposed to be taking it easy. I camehome from the grocery store to find him cutting back honeysuckle vines. Men!My daily walk – outside!!

Keep in mind that I’m making fourdifferent afghans – these squares don’t all go together. There will be 24squares per afghan. I got so many comments about my “blonde”hair when I posted Tuesday’s picture on Facebook that I decided to take anotherselfie in different light to show that my hair is NOT blonde.

Dr. M gets to see these – I have the sun at my back on my morning commute.Steve had asked what a sun pillar was – it’s just a vertical shaft of lightextending upward or downward from the sun – which is different from a “sun dog”– those sort of mini suns that appear on either side of the sun.Campus bluejay.Saturday,February 14th        I had a greatValentine’s Day! I had informed Dr. M that I didn’t want to leave the house on Saturdayso he volunteered to go out to get groceries. When he left it was doing this. It’shard to tell, but the wind was blowing reallyhard & snow was flying everywhere. Super cold too.  I was so grateful that he let me stay home(where I vacuumed & dusted & did laundry – but DID NOT HAVE TO PUT ONMAKEUP, so that was fabulous).Here aremy Valentine presents – chocolate & flowers are always a big hit aroundhere. And I had asked for one of those solar dancing critters to take to theoffice (we have a penguin here at home & it makes me laugh), so he gave mea bug.

{"title": "Book Review Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday, February 3, 2015", "text": "It’s time once again for my scintillating interestingbrief book reviews!1. The LongWay Home (Chief Inspector Armand Gamache #10), by LouisePenny. Happily retired in the village of Three Pines, Armand Gamache,former Chief Inspector of Homicide with the Sûreté du Québec, has found a peacehe'd only imagined possible. On warm summer mornings he sits on a bench holdinga small book, The Balm in Gilead, in his large hands. \"There is a balm inGilead,\" his neighbor Clara Morrow reads from the dust jacket, \"tomake the wounded whole.\" While Gamache doesn't talk about his wounds andhis balm, Clara tells him about hers. Peter, her artist husband, has failed tocome home… She wants Gamache's help to find him… The journey takes them furtherand further from Three Pines, to the very mouth of the great St. Lawrenceriver. To an area so desolate, so damned, the first mariners called it The landGod gave to Cain. And there they discover the terrible damage done by asin-sick soul.The Bug Says: Ilistened to the audio version of this book. I love the narrator, and as I saidon the last Book Review Tuesday, I could listen to Louise Penny’s characterstalk about cheese all day & be perfectly happy. Her style might not appealto everyone, but I always feel like I’m coming home when I read an InspectorGamache book. I’m thinking of re-reading all of them before the next one comesout! I gave this book five stars.2.  The IcePrincess (Fjällbacka #1), by Camilla Läckberg. Returning to herhometown after the funeral of her parents, writer Erica Falck finds a communityon the brink of tragedy. The death of her childhood friend, Alex, is just thebeginning. Her wrists slashed, her body frozen in an ice cold bath, it seems thatshe has taken her own life. Erica conceives a memoir about the beautiful butremote Alex, one that will answer questions about their lost friendship. Whileher interest grows to an obsession, local detective Patrik Hedström isfollowing his own suspicions about the case. But it is only when they startworking together that the truth begins to emerge about the small town with adeeply disturbing past.The Bug Says: Ilistened to this one on audio too – which is good because the book is set inSweden, & all the Swedish names would have been hard for me to keepstraight in print! I had read books 3 & 4 of the series & decided thatI wanted to start from the beginning. I don’t know why I enjoy them so much –they’re police procedurals wherein a small town police department has to solvemurders. I think that the characters are so well written – there’s humor and a reallygreat turn of phrase (much better than I’m able to convey, obviously – ha!). Igave it five stars too.3. StillMidnight (Alex Morrow #1), byDenise Mina. It's the case that could make DS Alex Morrow's career, it wouldmake any salivate. A home invaded in the dead of night, deep in the heart ofthe cosy suburbs; a hard working family at the heart of it and a vulnerable oldman taken hostage. It's high profile, a black-and-white case and it shouldn'tbe hard to solve ...The Bug Says: Asyou may or may not recall, I read the 2nd book in this seriesfirst & really enjoyed it. I wasn’t able to get the audio version of thisbook (I missed the Scottish narrator), and for some reason I took my own sweettime reading it. (I see from Goodreads that it took me 26 days to finish!) Butonce I got into the meat of the story I really really enjoyed it (yes, brokenrecord here). She’s another writer who has a lovely turn of phrase, often abouta grim reality. I gave it 4 stars (just because of how long it took me to getinto it).4. The Job (Foxand O'Hare #3), by Janet Evanovich & Lee Goldberg. Charming con manNicolas Fox and dedicated FBI agent Kate O'Hare secretly take down world’s most-wantedand untouchable felons. Next job: Violante, the brutal leader of a globaldrug-smuggling empire. The FBI doesn’t know what he looks like, where he is, orhow to find him, but Nick knows his tastes in gourmet chocolate.  FromNashville to Lisbon back alleys, from Istanbul rooftops to Thames, they chaseclues to lookalike thefts. Pitted against a psychopathic bodyguard holding Katehostage and a Portuguese enforcer getting advice from an ancestor's pickledhead, they again call driver Willie for the ship, actor Boyd for one-eyedCaptain Bridger, special effects carpenter Tom, her father Jake - retiredSpecial Forces, and his talent - machete-wielding Somali pirate Billy Dee. Thiscould be their biggest job - if they survive. The Bug Says: Evanovichis the author of the popular Stephanie Plum series, and this one is somewhatsimilar, except that in this seriesthe woman is competent at her job. I love the humor in these books & thefact that they don’t require a lot of thought – or time investment. I gave itthree stars.5. Serial, the Podcast. Serial is apodcast from the creators of This American Life, and is hosted bySarah Koenig. Serial tells one story - a true story - over the courseof an entire season. Each season, we'll follow a plot and characters whereverthey take us. And we won’t know what happens at the end until we get there, notlong before you get there with us. The Bug Says: OK,so it’s not really a book, per se. But I listened to it instead of listening toan audio book so I’m counting it. They’re planning to tell a different storyeach season. This season the story was about a convicted murderer, Adnon Syed,who may or may not be guilty. There are 12 episodes that you can download &listen to. I’d been told that I would LOVE this podcast by a number of people,but I stubbornly resisted until it was “assigned” for book club. And aspromised, I loved it! Which should not be a surprise since most of the books Iread have something to do with murder. I even gave it four stars on Goodreads,but apparently seeing as how it’s not actually a book, Goodreads has since removedit from their database. Ha!Currently I’m listening to SycamoreRow, by John Grisham (just love the southern accent of the narrator),and reading The Cypher(Guardians Inc. #1), by Julian Rosado-Machain. The Cypher is my Kindle freebie for book club & it’ssurprisingly good! He needs an editor (grammar typos), but the story is prettyinteresting. Of course, I’m only 34% done, so who knows how it’ll turn out. I’lllet you know in the next edition of Book Review Tuesday!"},

It actually is really interesting, but it's not what this post is about.As you might remember, I'm participating in the Moogly Afghan Crochet Along. We're onto square two, and after I finished the first one (I'm actually making four separate afghans) I realized that I needed to finally learn how to block my crochet projects. Blocking just means using one of various methods to straighten out the project so it looks neat. I decided to use the wet blocking method (basically soaking the project & then pinning it in place). I had to order some supplies to make it easier & they arrived today so I was really excited to block a couple of squares. Please note: I've been researching how to take better photos of my projects, but I haven't quite sorted that out yet, so these photos aren't all that fabulous.I ordered these interlocking mats & some pins. I had tried to use straight pins on the carpet (an option that was mentioned) on a past project with not fabulous results.Here's the first square - looking rather wrinkly.Halfway through - I wanted it to be 12\" x 12\" - looks like pinning it was definitely necessary!All done!Here's another square put on top for comparison.Now they're both pinned & just need to dry.

Now tell me why in the world an IT guy would need a mallet? I sent him an email to ask, but haven't heard back.

I have to say, I'm really enjoying Serial, but I've been hardened by reading so many murder mysteries. The narrator will say, \"this next part is pretty disturbing,\" and I'm never really disturbed. And that disturbs me.I've been crocheting up a storm, but I'm trying to do a better job of photographing my work.

He's talking about his grandfather, and great-grandfather, and the one before that, and the one before that... Very interesting!My last edition of Book Review Tuesday was a four weeks ago, and yet I've only read four books since then. I guess Christmas slowed me down...1. We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, by Karen Joy Fowler. Meet the Cooke family. Our narrator is Rosemary Cooke. As a child, she never stopped talking; as a young woman, she has wrapped herself in silence: the silence of intentional forgetting, of protective cover. Something happened, something so awful she has buried it in the recesses of her mind. Now her adored older brother is a fugitive, wanted by the FBI for domestic terrorism. And her once lively mother is a shell of her former self, her clever and imperious father now a distant, brooding man. And Fern, Rosemary’s beloved sister, her accomplice in all their childhood mischief? Fern’s is a fate the family, in all their innocence, could never have imagined. The Bug Says: This was a book club book. What a very interesting book! I listened the audio version. The narration was pretty good, other than the fact that the narrator? Liked to put questions into the middle of many sentences. But the book! I'm not going to give away the big reveal (which comes about a third of the way into the book, & probably I'm the only person in the world who didn't already know), but I was fascinated by the whole concept. And very very very (very!) sad about it too. Wow. I gave it four stars.2.  The Edge of Light (At Home in Beldon Grove #1), by Ann Shorey. It is the summer of 1838 in St. Lawrenceville, Missouri, and Molly McGarvie's life is about to change forever. When her beloved Samuel succumbs to cholera, Molly is heartbroken but determined to take care of herself and her children. But when Samuel's unscrupulous brother takes over the family business and leaves Molly to fend for herself, she knows she must head out on her own. It is a dangerous journey and Molly has to leave her old life behind. Somehow she must find a way to make a living, keep her family together, and fend off some over-eager suitors.The Bug Says: This was my Kindle freebie for book club. I enjoyed this story about a woman trying to care for herself and her children on the frontier. She even comes up with a way to earn money or barter for goods. And there's a side story about her best friend who is a slave. But I gave it three stars because the writing style was choppy. There might be an unpleasant event about to happen, and the book would skip it entirely & just refer to it in the past. On the other hand it was a very quick read!  3. White Fire (Pendergast #13), by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child. Special Agent Pendergast arrives at an exclusive Colorado ski resort to rescue his protégée, Corrie Swanson, from serious trouble with the law. His sudden appearance coincides with the first attack of a murderous arsonist who--with brutal precision--begins burning down multimillion-dollar mansions with the families locked inside. After springing Corrie from jail, Pendergast learns she made a discovery while examining the bones of several miners who were killed 150 years earlier by a rogue grizzly bear. Her finding is so astonishing that it, even more than the arsonist, threatens the resort's very existence. Drawn deeper into the investigation, Pendergast uncovers a mysterious connection between the dead miners and a fabled, long-lost Sherlock Holmes story--one that might just offer the key to the modern day killings as well. Now, with the ski resort snowed in and under savage attack--and Corrie's life suddenly in grave danger--Pendergast must solve the enigma of the past before the town of the present goes up in flames.The Bug Says: You know, I was about to say that I don't know why I keep reading these Pendergast novels because they've just jumped the shark too many times. But really, this whole series, from beginning to end, is just outrageous & unbelievable. And frankly I eat it up. In this one the Corrie character repeatedly did really dumb things, and that was frustrating to me because I think of her as smarter than that. But as I recall, she was equally foolhardy in all the other books, so I suppose she stayed in character. This book was interesting because of the Sherlock Holmes connection, but I just gave it 3 stars because it wasn't quite as good as other Pendergast books I've read.4. Festive in Death (In Death #39), by J.D. Robb. Eve Dallas deals with a homicide—and the holiday season—in the latest from the #1 New York Times bestselling author. Personal trainer Trey Ziegler was in peak physical condition. If you didn't count the kitchen knife in his well-toned chest. Lieutenant Eve Dallas soon discovers a lineup of women who'd been loved and left by the narcissistic gym rat. While Dallas sorts through the list of Ziegler's enemies, she's also dealing with her Christmas shopping list—plus the guest list for her and her billionaire husband's upcoming holiday bash. Feeling less than festive, Dallas tries to put aside her distaste for the victim and solve the mystery of his death. There are just a few investigating days left before Christmas, and as New Year's 2061 approaches, this homicide cop is resolved to stop a cold-blooded killer.The Bug Says: Oh I just love Eve Dallas and her sidekick Peabody. These books are a special treat for me. I like some of them better than others, & this is one of the good ones. I gave it four stars.Currently, I'm reading Still Midnight, by Denise Mina (a Scottish police procedural), and A Long Way Home, by Louise Penny (an Inspector Gamache mystery). Frankly I could listen to Louise Penny's characters just talk about cheese all day - a mystery is icing on the cake!What are you reading?"},

I love the foggy pictures… Christmas with my brother andhis family. Fun!Thursday,December 25th Christmas breakfast – leftoverChinese food plus candy that my nephew brought me from Japan. Most excellent!On our way to Dr. M’s dad’s house wesaw some of the usual suspects.My daily walk – down to the churchcemetery where Dr. M’s mother and grandparents rest.When we went by to pick up his AuntJudy these guys came by to greet us. Ha!Christmas with Dr. M’s family –always a great time.The moon!Friday,December 26th  My daily walk. Daddy took meover to my Aunt Mimi’s property so I could walk around. My cousins & someof their kids were there (score!) and some of us walked down to the river.While I was doing that, Dr. Mwas doing his thing. Saturday,December 26th    Spent theday with friends from college (well, one of them is my first cousin so I’veknown her a little longer). This isthe group of ladies that’s been getting together since around 1984 or so. Acouple of the next generation girls joined us (they’re the ones that look likemodels). We had a great time – lunch first, & then shopping in Blowing Rockand Boone. I totally counted that as my daily walk! By the way – I had to laughat the barrel of “candy sticks” at the general store. They sure still look likecandy cigarettes to me!Dr. Mtook a last drive around to check out his flocks. Whew! Hope everyone has a great week!"},

Monday,December 15th Happy Anniversary! It was our anniversary, but Dr.M was grading all day & I had to work, so we waited until Tuesday to celebrate.I decided that I needed to block the little hat I had made. I dampened the brim& found just the thing to use as a hat form so it could dry straightenedout somewhat.That evening I decided to make ahat that might actually fit an infant. My daily walk – the first of theChristmas jammies. Plus, snowman earrings!Tuesday,December 16th      I thought a hat comparison wasin order. Ha!Dr. M found some Christmasdecorations – imagine that!We went out to our favoriteMexican restaurant for our anniversary. We took pictures of the food, but youknow, Mexican food isn’t really all that attractive. Heh.My daily walk – Chilly WillyChristmas jammies. Wednesday,December 17thOur Christmas tree.

Yes, we are insane. I had choir practice &decided to get a picture of the altar. Waiting…My daily walk, this time not in jammies – just a Christmas vest.Thursday,December 18th Hard at work on another crochetproject I happened to glance down & was highly amused. From Facebook: I just told Dr.M that I didn't know how he's been able handle how sexy I'velooked all day. What? You don't think Chilly Willy jammies, plaid shirt, purplesocks, & slippers are sexy? My daily walk. Sock Monkey-ishGingerbread Man jammies.Friday,December 19th  Finished! Whew! This is for aPenn State fan.This is for Bella Rum at Cul-de-Sac Chronicles – it’smy handy dandy needle threader – designed for yarn. I noticed when I took thepicture that the small wire part meant for regular needles & thread isbroken. We decided to have date night atRural King and drove around looking at lights afterward. This place wasimpressive – they had music, and one of the trains had a camera on it, whichfed to the TV screen.My daily walk – boring jeans anda pajama top. But look! I noticed this tiny little pocket on the sleeve whichwas perfect for my MP3 player :)Saturday,December 20th    Got thebright idea to make booties to go with the little hat. Um, a little large, yes?Ha!My dailywalk. OK, this was really cheating, but I did actually walk for 20 minutes – upand down the hallway, so I could watch Forrest Gump.

Dr. M took this picture inthe wee hours of Thursday morning (he often wakes up in the middle of the night).I worked feverishly all evening onthis alluring ugly hat. It’s a lovely chartreuse color that doesn’t showup correctly in these pictures. But it’s reflective, so hopefully people cansee me when I’m out at night. I took it for a spin on my daily walk. The moon! It’s a two-fer! Isn’t itinteresting how much it changed in the roughly 21 hours between pictures?Friday,December 12th  Got some good news in the mailtoday. This is from Dr. M’s facebook page.My daily walk. I just wasn’t inthe mood to go outside, even though it was warm(ish). You may or may not be able to tell, but those are Mickey Mouse pajama pants. And you may or may not be interested to know that I wore those same pants for my walk the next day. Around the neighborhood. In the daylight. I am nothing if not fashionable.Saturday,December 13th    My dailywalk – love the rust colored plants! Yarrow of some kind?Wedecorated our tree!!Today Iworked feverishly on a hat for someone’s baby.

{"title": "Book Review Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday, December 9, 2014", "text": "Here we go again, another edition of Book Review Tuesday. In the six weeks since I last posted I've read six books. Well, actually I only finished four of them - which is just bizarre for me because I don't care how bad it is, I usually just complain a lot & keep reading. Oh, yes, there was another book that I'm not even listing here because it was so bad that I only read about four pages (it was the Kindle freebie for my book club - fortunately the \"real\" book is much better, but I'm still reading it so you'll hear about it next time). 1. Blood Magick (TheCousins O'Dwyer Trilogy #3), by Nora Roberts. County Mayo is rich in the traditions of Ireland, legends that BrannaO’Dwyer fully embraces in her life and in her work as the proprietor of TheDark Witch shop, which carries soaps, lotions, and candles for tourists, madewith Branna’s special touch. Branna’s strengthand selflessness hold together a close circle of friends and family—along withtheir horses and hawks and her beloved hound. But there’s a single missing linkin the chain of her life: love… The Bug Says: Well that description doesn't come close to talking about what this trilogy is about - three witches who are slaying ancient evil. In general I enjoy Nora's witchy stuff. She has a number of magical trilogies. This one was just ok. I liked the first book in the series best, and this one least. I gave it 3 stars.2. The Lucky Dog Matchmaking Service, by Beth Kendrick. Lara Madigan has a gift. She can help you find your soulmate—your canine soulmate, that is. As a dog trainer with a soft spot for strays, she’s found perfect homes for sulky Shih Tzus, broken-down Border collies, and diabolical Dalmatians. But while she’ll always make room for one more rescue mutt, she’s not sure she’s ready to commit to another human being. Especially after her live-in boyfriend drops the bomb: He’s not a dog person.The Bug Says: As far as I can recall, I got the idea of reading this book from my book a day calendar. I thought that maybe since they recommended it, it would have a little more substance than that description might lead you to believe it has. Um, no. Don't get me wrong - it's a fun romp, & I enjoyed the twist at the end, but it's exactly the kind of book it sounds like, with the addition of a LOT of dogs. I gave it 3 stars.3. Deadly Housewives, edited by Christine Matthews. Wisteria Lane has nothing on the grandes dames of mystery. . . .In the expert hands of fourteen unsurpassed storytellers, being a housewife takes on a whole new meaning. Get ready for a lethal mix of meddling mothers-in-law, creepy neighbors, cheating husbands, fickle female friends, careers left behind, out-of-control kids, steamy sex, and much, much more in this thrilling collection of never-before-published stories! Go behind the lace curtains and PTA smiles to explore the often mind-numbing reality of being a housewife. You'll laugh, you'll scream, you'll recognize yourself or your best friend in each of these deadly situations.Join Nevada Barr, Barbara Collins, Carole Nelson Douglas, Eileen Dreyer, Vicki Hendricks, Suzann Ledbetter, Elizabeth Massie, Christine Matthews, Denise Mina, Marcia Muller, Sara Paretsky, Nancy Pickard, S. J. Rozan, and Julie Smith on a riotous ride through the dark but often hilarious corners of the housewife psyche. In Deadly Housewives, the murders and mysteries on Wisteria Lane will look like an elementary-school bake sale compared to the thrills and suspense that these masters cook up! The Bug Says: Oh man I really wanted to enjoy this, but after a couple of stories I just gave up. I don't know if it was the uneven writing or the succession of women who weren't very nice, but it just turned me off. I didn't even like the Nevada Barr story and I love Nevada Barr. Sigh. I gave it 2 stars.4. Cold Days (The Dresden Files #14), by Jim Butcher. HARRY DRESDEN LIVES!!! After being murdered by a mystery assailant, navigating his way through the realm between life and death, and being brought back to the mortal world, Harry realizes that maybe death wasn’t all that bad. Because he is no longer Harry Dresden, Chicago’s only professional wizard.He is now Harry Dresden, Winter Knight to Mab, the Queen of Air and Darkness. After Harry had no choice but to swear his fealty, Mab wasn’t about to let something as petty as death steal away the prize she had sought for so long. And now, her word is his command, no matter what she wants him to do, no matter where she wants him to go, and no matter who she wants him to kill...The Bug Says: Woo hoo! After the not fabulous Ghost Story, this Harry Dresden was a relief. I enjoyed the romp through the magical world quite a bit. I think it's because I enjoy Harry himself so much - as long as he's not being a ghost I enjoy following him around & watching him wreak havoc. I gave it 4 stars.5. Dangerous Women, edited by George R.R. Martin. All new and original to this volume, the 21 stories in Dangerous Women include work by twelve New York Times bestsellers, and seven stories set in the authors’ bestselling continuities—including a new “Outlander” story by Diana Gabaldon, a  tale of Harry Dresden’s world by Jim Butcher, a story from Lev Grossman set in the world of The Magicians, and a 35,000-word novella by George R. R. Martin about the Dance of the Dragons, the vast civil war that tore Westeros apart nearly two centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones.Also included are original stories of dangerous women--heroines and villains alike--by Brandon Sanderson, Joe Abercrombie, Sherilynn Kenyon, Lawrence Block, Carrie Vaughn,  S. M. Stirling, Sharon Kay Penman, and many others.The Bug Says: Maybe I just don't enjoy short stories? Not that I didn't enjoy some of the stories. The Jim Butcher one was excellent (of course), & I enjoyed the Diana Gabaldon one. And there were some others that I liked pretty well. I listened 20 of the 21, and the biggest problem I had was that in a number of them the story wasn't about the so-called dangerous woman, but really about a man who had a problem with a woman. Urgh. The one story I didn't even listen to? The last one - by Mr. Game of Thrones himself. I was already bored with it when the book expired (I downloaded it from the library), so I just didn't renew it. I gave the collection 3 stars.6.  Skin Game (The Dresden Files #15), by Jim Butcher. Harry Dresden, Chicago's only professional wizard, is about to have a very bad day… Because as Winter Knight to the Queen of Air and Darkness, Harry never knows what the scheming Mab might want him to do. Usually, it’s something awful. He doesn’t know the half of it…Mab has just traded Harry’s skills to pay off one of her debts. And now he must help a group of supernatural villains—led by one of Harry’s most dreaded and despised enemies, Nicodemus Archleone—to break into the highest-security vault in town, so that they can then access the highest-security vault in the Nevernever. It's a smash and grab job to recover the literal Holy Grail from the vaults of the greatest treasure hoard in the supernatural world—which belongs to the one and only Hades, Lord of the freaking Underworld and generally unpleasant character. Worse, Dresden suspects that there is another game afoot that no one is talking about. And he's dead certain that Nicodemus has no intention of allowing any of his crew to survive the experience. Especially Harry.Dresden's always been tricky, but he's going to have to up his backstabbing game to survive this mess—assuming his own allies don’t end up killing him before his enemies get the chance… The Bug Says: Of course, as soon as I finished the last book I went right to the library & downloaded this one. I gobbled it down like candy - it was great fun!  Now, sadly, I'm all caught up on the series, so I have to wait until next year to see what happens next. I gave it 5 stars.Right now I'm listening to We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, and getting ready to read my Kindle freebie for book club (The Edge of Light, At Home in Beldon Grove #1). I know you can't wait to see what I think about them!"},

My mom’s side has even more people, but we don’t get togetheranymore (insert sad face here).·         A couple of weeks ago Stephen Hayes asked, “Do you feel colder this winter without your long hair?” The answer is, sometimes, but mostly not. Sometimes I feel like I need to wear a scarf in the house because my neck gets cold. Outside I either AM wearing a scarf or my coat is sufficient. But one of the reasons I got my hair cut was “the menopause,” and frankly I think I did the wrong thing. Because I still have a LOT of hair, only I can’t pull it away from my head like before. Some nights I’m tempted to just chop it down even further… But I’m going to resist & let it grow back out again :)·         Speaking of hair, Rita – thatlong hair look in the family Thanksgiving photo is just the ruffles on my shrug (I forgot to point out thatI wore the shrug I made).·        OK, about that persimmonpudding, my aunt didn’t make it this year!

Justsomething to show that you’ve wandered around outside somewhere. If you don’twant to email a picture to me, you can post it on your blog instead. Pleasekeep the picture family friendly because I’m gonna post it on my blog (you knewI would, right?). Go check out Elizabeth’s Lilla Rose site here and see all the differentstyles available. She’ll give away a style/size that she has in stock (excludingthe clip of the month).

I could walk during lunch, but that would mean actually taking a lunch hour.There probably won't be a \"Book Review Tuesday\" tomorrow because I'm only on part 4 of 26 in the  audio book of short stories (Dangerous Women), and only 7 % done with Ramona and 19% done with Blood Magick.

A lot of the time was spent being contemplative. It's nice to not have anything you have to do. And our particular group is a lot of fun - there was MUCH laughter when we weren't having to be silent (& some during the silence too - ha!).

{"title": "Book Review Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday, October 28, 2014", "text": "This might become a thing, but I don't know - I go in spurts as to how much reading I get done. For example, the Goldfinch took approximately 8 years to finish reading (it didn't really take 8 years). But I like it when Ellen does her quarterly book list, so I thought I'd try something similar - except I have to do it weekly because if any more time goes by I won't remember whether I liked it or what it was about. So here goes.The first thing you need to know is that I am NOT a picky reader. 95% of the books I've read have gotten three or more stars. So take my reviews with a grain of salt. In the last week I've finished four books. That seems a bit excessive.1. Ghost Story (the Dresden Files series, #13),  by Jim Butcher. When an unknown someone shoots him and leaves him to die, Harry Dresden hopes he might be heading to a better place. Unfortunately, being dead doesn’t make Harry’s life any easier.   Trapped between life and death, he learns that his friends are in serious trouble. Only by finding his murderer can he save his friends and move on—a feat which would be a lot easier if he had a body and access to his powers. Worse still are the malevolent shadows that roam Chicago, controlled by a dark entity that wants Harry to suffer even in death.   Now, the late Harry Dresden will have to pull off the ultimate trick without using any magic—or face an eternity as just another lost soul… (Description from Amazon)The Bug Says:  I read the Kindle version. I liked this book fairly well, but not as much as prior books. Too much talking & not enough of Harry setting things on fire. This didn't keep me from plowing right through the thing to find out what happened. I gave it 3 stars.2. The Giver, by Lois Lowry. The Giver, the 1994 Newbery Medal winner, has become one of the most influential novels of our time. The haunting story centers on twelve-year-old Jonas, who lives in a seemingly ideal, if colorless, world of conformity and contentment. Not until he is given his life assignment as the Receiver of Memory does he begin to understand the dark, complex secrets behind his fragile community. (Description from Goodreads)The Bug Says: I read the Kindle version. I read this book for my book club. It's a pretty short book  - yet another take on a young person trapped in a strange land. At first I wasn't very excited about that, but I like Jonas, and I was interested to see what would happen. I gave it 4 stars.3. The End of the Wasp Season, (Alex Morrow #2), by Denise Mina. When a notorious millionaire banker hangs himself, his death attracts no sympathy. The terrible legacy of a lifetime of selfishness is widespread but most acute among those he ought to be protecting: his family. Meanwhile, in a wealthy suburb of Glasgow, a young woman is found savagely murdered, leaving the community stunned. When Detective Inspector Alex Morrow, heavily pregnant with twins, is called in to investigate, she soon discovers that a tangled web of lies lurks behind the murder. It’s a web that will spiral through Alex’s own home, the local community, and ultimately right back to a swinging rope, hundreds of miles away.  (Description from Goodreads)The Bug Says: I listened to the audio version (Scottish narrator - swoon). I got this book from my page a day book calendar. It's a police procedural & I found it very interesting. I might go back & read the first one in the series. There's a great twist at the end that I wasn't expecting at all. I gave it 4 stars.4. The Book of Life (All Souls Trilogy #3), by Deborah Harkness. After traveling through time in Shadow of Night, the second book in Deborah Harkness’s enchanting series, historian and witch Diana Bishop and vampire scientist Matthew Clairmont return to the present to face new crises and old enemies. At Matthew’s ancestral home at Sept-Tours, they reunite with the cast of characters from A Discovery of Witches—with one significant exception. But the real threat to their future has yet to be revealed, and when it is, the search for Ashmole 782 and its missing pages takes on even more urgency. In the trilogy’s final volume, Harkness deepens her themes of power and passion, family and caring, past deeds and their present consequences. In ancestral homes and university laboratories, using ancient knowledge and modern science, from the hills of the Auvergne to the palaces of Venice and beyond, the couple at last learn what the witches discovered so many centuries ago.  (Description from Goodreads)The Bug Says: I read the Kindle version. I really really resisted reading the first book in this series (A Discovery of Witches) & only finally read it because it became available from my library right as I finished reading another book. And it lived down to my expectations. Oh, another witch/vampire/daemon book. Yay. But, as so often happens, despite the fact that I really didn't want to read the 2nd book (Shadow of Night), I had to because, hello, series, and I absolutely loved it. I didn't love this final book in the trilogy quite as much as book 2, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. Just finished it at lunch at work today. I gave it 4 stars.Whew! Well I can already tell that I won't have that many books next week - the audio book I'm listening to right now (Dangerous Women), is a collection of 21 short stories. That surely will take a while, right?"},

Well, I'll just do the random that I would have done yesterday if Mr. Dresden hadn't been so needy.Speaking of Dresden - I finished the book about an hour ago (I am NOT a slow reader, but I actually had to work today). It was pretty good, but it gets three stars instead of the usual four I give to Dresden books. It was kind of talky and not as action-y as I like. I read Charles Frazier books for introspection - Harry Dresden is for things getting set on fire & saving people in distress. Now I'm making myself wait before I start the next one in the series (#14).I think I've mentioned before that, in addition to horrible free Kindle downloads, my book club mostly reads young adult fiction. This month's selection is The Giver by Lois Lowry. Looks like it will be pretty good. I'll let you know what I think!I'm watching Game 1 of the World Series right now. It's the first inning & Hunter Pence - that wild & crazy Matthew McConaughey look alike - just hit a home run. I can't decide who I'm pulling for. I have a lot of friends pulling for Kansas, so maybe to do them a favor I'll pull for San Francisco. Direct TV seems to be single-handedly paying for post season baseball. And I have to say that I don't find non-creepy Rob Lowe to be any less creepy than creepy Rob Lowe. Dr. M does NOT have to worry about me fantasizing about either of them!I'm back to eating real food now. Thank goodness! I was having trouble figuring out how to get my veggies in. I did have soup, but all that sodium... OK, I'm behind again on reading blogs, so I'm heading over to Bloglovin now. What are you guys reading or watching or eating these days?"},

See, even though we’re not there,we’re participating!After dropping Dr. M off at theschool, I went thrift store shopping (for a Hawaiian shirt – more on that nextweek). Then spent some quality time crocheting a new project & listening tothis most excellent book by the author of ColdMountain. He’s SUCH a good writer!I headed back to campus a littleearly so I could take my daily walk before Dr. M was finished.Saturday,October 18th    Somerandom pictures from Clarksville. Dr. M did more conferencing in the morning& then we went downtown to check out a pub that had been recommended. Asmentioned in yesterday’s post I had French toast. Dr. M got the shrimp &grits.

Then Dr. came back & we checked out & went to a pub where I ate...After all of that you might wonder what I had for dinner. Well, I'll tell you. After we had brunch we drove like fiends for about 6 hours (listening to Charles Frazier's Thirteen Moons - fabulous!) & now I'm sipping on some black bean soup.

And now that it's all set up I probably won't actually use it for work for several weeks. I was reviewing my calendar & realized that I'm going to be away from home for the next three weekends! Land sakes! I'm not cut out for all this gallivanting (I got new boots last week, which explains my turns of phrase here). Next weekend we're headed to a conference in Tennessee. The weekend after we'll be in Louisville. And the weekend after THAT I'll be at a Vestry retreat. November doesn't look any less crazy. Eep.Today was \"wear purple\" day at work. I admit that I went onto the interwebs last night to figure out an interesting way to wear my scarf. Fun & easy! (My hair is a bit wild - lots of running my fingers through it while I figured out a problem at work.)However, Dr. M wins the day.

Sheesh.Here I am, hard at work even before breakfast!Mushroom, pepper & cheese omelet & grits - this is a definite advantage to working from home.Took a break & started a new book. This is from the forward. I can't remember if I've told you guys that along with a \"real\" book, my book club has started assigning the free Kindle book associated with our birth month. What a hoot! Not to say that all free Kindle books aren't real, but they are usually pretty uneven in quality. And many of them are stealth Christian books. This one, however, is letting us know right up front what the agenda is - refreshing! I used to read a lot of light Christian romance & I enjoyed it. I'm more into mysteries lately, but this will be nice change. Unlike my free Kindle book from two months ago which was basically porn with a plot!Lunch! Mixed greens, home grown tomatoes, peppers, almonds & feta.After work I roamed around taking pictures. I had to laugh at how I had apparently grabbed my lunch tomatoes from the middle of the pack. Bottom left is a weed that we kind of liked & let grow all summer - now it's blooming. And bottom right is our little watermelon that we decided to go ahead & pick since it was probably not going to get any bigger with the cold weather. New crochet project. It's supposed to be a shrug, but I'm thinking I'll have to modify it if it's going to fit me - the model in their picture is about the size of Twiggy.From my daily walk. This week there's a theme of abandoned children's \"vehicles\" on the sidewalks. Spent some time catching up on blogs. This is Stuff from Ellen's Head - you should check it out!I was having more & more trouble pulling the yarn from my skein so I finally decided to see what the problem was. Apparently these two decided to become as one. The picture is blurry because I when I picked them up they started spinning together. Needless to say that once I got them disentangled I separated them in the basket :)Of course we watched baseball - although we didn't stay up for the end.

I've tried the Flylady system. And the Clean Team. And putting reminders on my computer (yes, there's a reminder on there to clean the toilet). And nothing ever works. Because I don't work - I would much rather read blogs than dust or clean the bathroom. Heaven help ever cleaning out the fridge or the microwave (which just needs wiped down for heaven's sake).

To get affirmation or commiseration? Nope. This is just a warning that if you should stop by my house for some reason, you need to give me 15 minutes to toss the joint before you can even get in the door. And don't even THINK about looking at my baseboards!P.S. Our water leaves behind a yellowish residue that hardens to concrete. What the heck is that?

The other evening I tried Sparkling Ice Orange Mango Naturally Flavored Sparkling Mountain Spring Water (yes, it has the word \"sparkling\" twice in its name). It has 50 mg of green tea in it, and I looked it up, and they say there's no caffeine, but when I went to bed I tossed and I turned and turned and tossed. Urgh. Of course it could have been because of this next point...2. Oh the feet, they are HOT! I do not know what to do about this - I've always had such cold feet. Now I remember fondly the days of cold feet - running an inch deep bath to warm them up before bed - turning on my electric blanket & piling on an extra blanket or three plus a stuffed dog... Sigh. Anyway, my hot feet are keeping me awake at night. What to do? Ice packs?3. Dr. M & I decided to upgrade my computer hallelujah and amen. I had an older desktop and a not quite as old cheap laptop, and neither of one of them were working very well. It was taking me three hours or more just to get my Project 365 post completed. I got a discount through work on a new Dell laptop and so far I am VERY happy with it. Speedy, reliable, replaces my desktop & other laptop... It's nice to have everything in one (portable) place. Reminds me of one of the reasons I was so excited to get married - I could finally move all my stuff in with Dr. M instead of basically living in two places :)4. I have some sort of mange or some such on my face. A rash that reminds me of the acne rosacea I had years ago. I don't know - it's unattractive. BUT now I'm finally checking off one of those things on that list of 50 that I didn't quite get done last year. I'm going to a dermatologist & having a full skin scan done. I expect to either find out that none of my suspicious moles are suspicious or that I should have 10 removed. Oh, & hopefully she can take care of this mange thing.5. I can't think of a 5th thing, and it's almost bedtime and I still have to finish this chapter of the Harry Dresden book I'm reading. Harry is in dire straits. Will he get out of the current pickle?

I’m listening to the audio version(deadpan delivery, monotonous rendering) & I’m about 78% done. I don’treally care what happens to Theo or the painting. I am astounded that he’s ableto accomplish anything in life because at every important point in the book hejust seems dumbfounded by it all (mouth agape, awkward silences). And note allthese parentheticals I’m adding – there must be hundreds of thousands in thebook! Which is sort of ok in the descriptive sections, but many characters seemto have adopted the habit – they use them in conversation too. I find myselfdistracted , listening for the next description instead of paying attention tothe story.But here’s my problem. I profess to not caring about Theo orThe Goldfinch, but I have to know what happens. It’s a compulsion I have – I mightyell and curse and drive Dr. M crazy with my whining, but I never give up on abook. I'd like to check out the actual physical book from the library so I canscan it & skim over all the annoying bits (I’d be finished in an hour,tops!), but it’s so inexplicably popular that I would be #36 in line to readit. By the time it’s available I should be finished with the audio version.Let’s see. There are 32 parts. And I’m almost done with part25. Each part is about an hour long. That’s another seven hours of listeningpleasure. So I should be done sometime on Wednesday or Thursday. Oh joy. I’mgonna need to listen to a Jack Reacher book next just to cleanse my palate. Ha!"},

King Richard's tower was to our left, with the valiant king out front, scouting for a smooth path over the rough plain.As we commenced fire, we wondered what manner of beast that might be atop King Phillip's tower!  Alas, it was as if it possessed some power to ward off shots that appeared to be destined to unseat it!How can this shot have missed? How, but for some great magic spewed forth by yon beast! By this time, we had exhausted all but a few pink stones (pink tennis balls), imbued though they were with the magic of \"Hope\"  It was then that our fortunes turned! The pink stone smote the very top of Richard's tower, breaking it's canopy asunder and toppling the cursed war machine itself!As a haze settled over the field, Richard and Phillip withdrew, along with their remaining tower and its fell beast. The sun sets, and our banner yet flies over Acre!And now just for fun - a video where we laugh maniacally."},

I had a crazy busy day, Dr. M didn’t get home from school until 8:30 orso, AND I got two huge zits on my chin, so my actual birthday wasn’t really allthat fabulous. Except for the cake & balloon & lamb my coworkers gaveme, and eleventy-billion birthday wishes on Facebook, and all the cards I gotin the mail. Hmm – come to think about it, except for the zits & a minorskirmish with the IT department at work I had a great day! Ha!Anyway, 15 months ago Icame up with this list. I have notdone everything I’d hoped I would, but the list definitely pushed me to do somethings that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. And I’m going to come up with anew list to try to accomplish while I’m 50. We’ll see how that goes. If you’reinterested you can read on to see how I did. The ones in red font are the onesI accomplished – 28 out of 50. 1.       Review this list everySunday & plan which items I can do that week. Yeah, I didn’t do this. Seriously – the easiest thing on thelist – ha!2.       Go see the Dead SeaScrolls exhibit at the Cincinnati MuseumCenter.3.        Visit the Leo Petroglyph.4.       Go to an exhibit at thelocal historical societymuseum.5.       Check out the SerpentMound again.6.       Make exercise as much ofa habit as brushing & flossing my teeth! (I have come up with some minigoals to make this happen). I am working onthis one – my new bicycle is already motivating me! (Further update, Ihibernated this winter – can’t wait to get back on my bike once the snowmelts!)7.       Corral my sweet tooth.Your guess is as good as mine as to how I do it, but I’m going to start bywriting down everything I eat – especially since most people who lost weight& kept it off used a food journal. I’ll reevaluate this goal in June 2013to see how things are going. I never did figureout how to do this. And talking about it the day after my birthday is no timeto be talking about it!8.       Stay in a cabin in Hocking Hills.9.       Work a jigsaw puzzle inmy own home (this will require sacrificial use of the kitchen table). I have the puzzle, I just never have worked it. I think I’mgoing to take it to work to do during lunch.10.     Watch the rest of the Thin Man movies.11.    Go see Les Misérables inthe theater.12.    Go to a Cincinnati Redsbaseball game.13.    Reduce our debt by$10,000 (more would be better!). We hadto get a new car. We reduced the other debt by over $12,000, but the net resultof course is an increase. Sigh.14.    Eat fast food no more thantwice per week. 15.    Reduce my use of frozendinners for lunch – no more than two per week (less would be better!). My new lunchbox has helped so much with this!16.    Turn the computer off& crochet more in the evenings (I’ll need an action plan for this one –perhaps a buzzer that goes off at 8:00 so I have to get off of Facebook?). Wow I have NOT been doing this at all! Maybe I’ll try to do itduring Lent. 17.    Drink 36 ounces of actualwater a day (more would be better!). 18.    Do the jar of notes about goodthings for 2013 (Note: Find a jar for the notes). I’m going to do a post about the notes at some point soon.19.    Organize the spare room (Imight have to do this in stages).20.    Get my hair trimmed at leasttwice! 21.    Finally go see my AuntMimi’s house & property.22.    Visit the site of HenryRiver Mill Village.23.    Visit my cousin Scottie& her husband John.24.    Find a pair of shortblack boots suitable for work and snow. Darn it– I could have used these this winter!25.    Text my brother once perweek Um, I quit doing this a while back. We connect on Facebook nowsometimes. Does that count?26.    Visit Carillon Historical Park27.    Visit HuffmanPrairie Flying Field28.    Try to crochet a garmentfor myself (not a hat or scarf. Maybe this.)29.    Get rid of my stamping &scrapbooking things (to make room for yarn – ha!)30.    Try to grow lettuce.31.    Finally visit Rita &Mike. 32.    Meet K, J & S in themountains like we’ve planned for two years now. 33.    Stop drinking diet drinks. I go in spurts on this – I mainly just drink tea, butoccasionally get a craving & have a diet drink.34.    Finally clean up all the clutter at the office (I know my boss would bethrilled about this one). 35.    Make an appointment tosee a dermatologist just because.36.    Finish reading the Mary Russell books. 37.    Cook something new once per month (yeah – I’m not aiming for themoon here – ha!). I’m doing Weight Watchers again & I’ve actually been cookingmore because of that, but I won’t call this one accomplished yet.38.    Go through my closet with a fierce and brutal eye.39.    See Anne & Ken face to face again.40.    Write my 1000th blog post. 41.    Take Dr. M to Trader Joe’s.42.     Write down all the movieswe watch (so I can remember if I’ve watched the movie – sheesh!). Yeah –totally forgot about this one!43.    Go see Spam-A-Lot44.    Go to a performance at the Schuster center.45.    Visit Siebenthaler Fen once per season 46.    Go to the NC Outer Banks47.    Write & post 40 poems no matter how bad they are.

{"title": "Wordy Almost Wednesday - The Children of the Corn Edition", "date": "Tuesday, December 3, 2013", "text": "I've been having such a crazy fall. Super busy work. Church duties. Failed root canals... There hasn't been room in my brain for being very creative. Or attentive to other people's blogs (sorry!).And it doesn't really look like winter will be any better. My boss is leaving the company (his last day is this Friday) & my job will change in ways that I can't really imagine. We're getting a new roof put on the church, and replacing a vanity in the basement bathroom. And on Thanksgiving day I found a lump in one of my breasts that is probably just a cyst, but will need some kind of attention (I had a mammogram yesterday & the technician agreed with my assessment - but of course I'll need to hear the official word from the radiologist). And now it's Advent. We sit in darkness waiting for the great light. If you're Episcopalian like I am you try to tune out the Christmas music and settle in for the wait. Christmas Day is coming, but it's not here yet. So I'll add in some extra waiting to the season. The \"what the heck will my job look like\" waiting can mingle with the \"what the heck am I going to do with the grape in my breast\" waiting. I imagine myself, sitting in a darkened sacred space. One worry is in my left hand. The other clings to my hip like a small child. And we wait in peace for the light."},

I finally feel like life has calmed down a bit (just in time for the holidays!).If you're my Facebook friend don't get too excited - I posted this same thing a couple of weeks ago in response to one of those number memes. My sister-in-law gave me the #8 & I was supposed to tell 8 things about myself that people might not know. It's hard to imagine that everyone doesn't know everything about my life because I'm such an open book, but I know it's hard to remember everything, so here's a refresher for you:1. I used to be so needle-phobic that I once told a dentistto give me a filling WITHOUT Novocain. I don’t know if that’s the dumbest thingI ever did, but it’s close.2. When I was in the 3rd grade I tried to go by my middle name, Marie, becauseI thought Dana was such a weird name.3. When I was in Zambia I read just about every book by Alistair MacLean.4. Speaking of books, I’m a huge Dick Francis fan. So sad that he & hiswife are gone now…5. One of my summer jobs while I was in college was in a laundry. (This laundry, in fact.)I had one task – to arrange clean wet sheets in a bin so that they could be fedinto a huge rolling dryer. I took one end of the sheet & my partner tookthe other & we loosely folded them longwise into thirds. My partner hadbeen working in the laundry for over 20 years & this is all she did everyday. She always had to stand the same way, so that the motion of her armsalways went the same direction. After a week of doing this a muscle in my neckstarted aching, & for many years after I last worked there that ache wouldshow up when I was tired. This job was a HUGE incentive for me to finishcollege!6. I have had the most ginormous zit in the history of ginormous zits onmy face right now then. What the heck! I’m almost 50!7. I volunteered to lead an African (or Lambeth) BibleStudy at my church during Advent. I kind of hope it turns into a regularfeature – maybe not every week, but definitely during important seasons of thechurch year.8. After all these years I’m still amazed at how perfectly suited Dr. M andI are together. We aren’t perfect, but our imperfections seem to work for us.Happy Monday!"},

And the doctor was really really nice and verygentle, and except for him having to numb me a few extra times (and feeling a littleclaustrophobic with his hands in my mouth & by my nose) it wasn’t that bad.In fact, I spent part of the time grinning to myself becauseI was chanting a mantra during the claustrophobic  times and the only thing that came to mind wasmy Episcopal rosary prayers – “Jesus, Lamb of God…” and the doctor is Jewish.Ha! And I was really mad that I didn’t get my camera out to document the event.Do you think he would have minded if I had taken a few selfies while he wasdigging out my old filling? Unfortunately he wasn’t able to complete the root canalbecause he examined the tooth & apparently it has two rather significantcracks in it. So it needs to be pulled. It’s my next to last molar on thebottom left. Sigh. Ironically, the last time I had that tooth filled severalyears ago I told the dentist that I’d prefer if he just pulled it.In other news, apparently I have experienced Exploding HeadSyndrome! One night last week as I was just about to doze off, I heard a loudcrash in the ear that was on the pillow. I startled up, but realized thatnothing had made the noise – it was all in my head. At the time I meant toGoogle \"loud crashy noises in your head\" but forgot all about it untilI read SouthLakesMom’s post today.So I immediately went to the Google & what do you know! It’s actually athing! From Wikipedia:Exploding HeadSyndrome is a form of hypnagogic auditory hallucination andis a rare and relatively undocumented parasomnia event in which the subjectexperiences a loud bang in their head similar to a bomb exploding, a gun goingoff, a clash of cymbals, ringing, or any other form of loud, indecipherablenoise that seems to originate from inside the head.Who knew such a thing even existed!

{"title": "Last Night", "date": "Friday, August 23, 2013", "text": "Last night I had one of my very few bouts of insomnia. Yes, I tossed and turned from around 2:45 to 3:30. It was brutal! I kept obsessing over a problem from work, and then I moved on to another work problem and then to an issue with a delivery we got yesterday and finally I was freaking out about something that happened a month ago. My usual coping mechanism (imagining winning the lottery) failed me utterly (usually I’m asleep before I verify the last number on the lottery ticket).I finally fell asleep only to wake at 5:00 from a dream where I was running around a mall with no clothes on. If you must know, I realized that something was wrong, so I was looking for the lingerie department. All righty then!While I was brushing my teeth this morning I pondered all the anxiety from the night before. None of that stuff was freak-out-able. Really! It’s as if I thought, “I have nothing to blog about so create some drama.” Which, actually, is pretty much what I usually do around here anyway. But next time let’s do it without losing any of my (very) precious beauty sleep! Okay?So, how was your night?"},

In anticipation of the event, Dr. M had set up a citronella candle and a chair in the middle of the yard. There is a LOT of ambient light in our neighborhood so I didn’t think I would be able to see much. So, it’s 1:45 a.m. and I trundle outside in my pajamas and sit in the damp chair (ooh – that helped calm down the hot flash!). Dr. M said that it takes 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to darkness so I was hoping to be out there for at least 30 minutes – even though it wasn’t actually all that dark. But then the neighbors came home (loudly), and I sneezed, and I kept getting distracted by the lights around me, so I lasted 15 minutes. Go me! Ha.But oh the stars! Even though it wasn’t all that dark around me, the sky was completely clear & the more I looked, the more stars I could see. I was wishing I was awake enough to go drive out into the country because then I just know I would have been able to see ALL THE STARS.

Suffice it to say that they are both numerous & petty and not worth a square inch of your time. I have to say that when I look at my problems out of the corner of my eye, like a stranger would, I am annoyed that they’re so very small. Like a reverse microscope. It gripes me! (Let’s add that to the list.)And, really, here is the crux of the issue: I am pretty sure that oh, about 100% of the things that I’m complaining about are things for which I (usually prayerfully) VOLUNTEERED. (Except for vacuuming – who volunteers for that?) What do I have to say about that? Well?That’s what I thought – not much is what you have to say about that. So just do it!

{"title": "Riches Such as These", "date": "Friday, August 2, 2013", "text": "Last night Dr. M posted pictures from our back yard. As I was scrolling through them (go here to see for yourself) I kept thinking about how very fortunate we are to have this little house in our small town directly in the middle of our two jobs (40 miles south for me, 35 miles north for Dr. M). Yes, we spend too much on gas (maybe someone could give me a Prius for Christmas?), and our car insurance rate is higher because of the number of miles we put on the car, but being able to do work we enjoy and still be able to pay our bills makes it worth it. I’ve been reading The Great Emergence (how Christianity is changing and why), by Phyllis Tickle. I’m only about 33% done (according to my Kindle), but I’m fascinated by all the things (& people!) in history that have been (literally) world changing: the printing press, Galileo, the automobile, Freud, Einstein, Marx – just to name a few. Each of those people rocked the core of what people believed about themselves, God, and society. It’s really interesting to me to consider that impact, sitting in my 2013 back yard hundreds of miles from where I grew up. It makes the idea of returning to some mythical golden days seem nonsensical to me. Would those be the days just before or just after Luther nailed his theses to the door? Yesterday was the first day that I seriously thought about trying to figure out how to get my bike to the bike path for a ride. A couple of things are stopping me – we haven’t put the bike rack on the car yet, and I’m averaging less than 2 miles a day so far. Not really worth the bother to drive over there when riding in the neighborhood is fine for now. And also, there’s the delay factor: what seems like an excellent idea at 3:00 dims considerably after two more hours of work and an hour drive home. Ha!I’m rambling around because I wanted to write a poem today. I’m letting my mind drift in the hope that it will get snagged on a creative branch & stick long enough to put some non-prosical words here (ooh – maybe it’s working – I just made up a word!). Hmmm…Bees flowers birdsTomatoes on the vineA bicycle in blueYour hand in mineWho needs the seven seasWith riches such as these?"},

No! It was actually The Bug taking pictures - which is why they aren't quite in focus.If the paparazzi can't be bothered to use their best photographer then we aren't going to be bothered to hang around!2.

It seems to me that many people turn into hybrids on their bikes - part car, part pedestrian. And I might do that do once I start trying to ride around town. Who knows? One thing I do know: it is very weird to not come to a complete stop at a stop sign - I just roll & go & feel really daring. Flaunting the law! Multiple times on my ride! oooo... I do this because I'm still pretty awkward getting started pedaling. Nobody needs to see that! So I do anything I can to keep from coming to a complete stop.Every day when I walk around the parking lot at work I pass at least one car that is idling. The driver is just sitting in there listening to music, playing on their phone, taking a nap. Obviously taking their lunch break in their car. It's all I can do to keep from screaming at them, \"Why do you hate the earth so much!\" Ugh.(I am having to forcibly restrain my self from going back & changing all those \"theirs\" and \"thems\" to his/her and him/her.)I am really struggling trying to figure out what to do with the church landscaping. It's a lush jungle out there & I'd just as soon leave it alone, but I know that's not a good plan. We don't have anyone willing to work on it & can't afford professional help. And while I'm marginally willing, I'm not competent. Can I futz around until fall when everything will die back? It might happen!(I might apply the same tactic that I used way (way) back in the day in my home church. The organist got annoyed about something & quit & so they had me fill in. I had been taking organ lessons, but I pretty much had no idea what I was doing. The organist couldn't stand to have me messing around with his baby so he forgave everyone & came back to church. I figure if I whack enough things in the yard that I shouldn't, then people who didn't think they cared will suddenly start working in the yard too.)Tomorrow will be Day Seven of no soft drinks or caffeine. I will say that I have had a few days where I just wanted to crawl back into bed (but that could have been the heat). Otherwise - no ill effects. And no real desire to cheat. This goal has felt mostly unconquerable in the past and yet it was as easy as not buying any drinks last week when I went to the grocery store. This and my daily (short) bike rides give me hope for the future of my other health goals. Next up - yoga!Okay, I'm done rambling now. Enjoy the rest of your Monday!"},

So, in the interest of trying to figure out what they heck I’m doing, here is the whole list, with some commentary. Completed items are in red (I've done 15!). Feel free to just skim or totally skip – I wanted to have a post with all 50 items on it.1.       Review this list every Sunday & plan which items I can do that week. I am seriously going to start doing this again!2.        Go see the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit at the Cincinnati Museum Center.3.        Visit the Leo Petroglyph.4.        Go to an exhibit at the local historical society museum.5.        Check out the Serpent Mound again.6.        Make exercise as much of a habit as brushing & flossing my teeth! (I have come up with some mini goals to make this happen). I am working on this one – my new bicycle is already motivating me!7.       Corral my sweet tooth. Your guess is as good as mine as to how I do it, but I’m going to start by writing down everything I eat – especially since most people who lost weight & kept it off used a food journal. I’ll reevaluate this goal in June 2013 to see how things are going. I am off the rails on this one, but I’m trying again. This time it’s “no sweets during the week.” We’ll see how that goes.8.        Stay in a cabin in Hocking Hills.9.       Work a jigsaw puzzle in my own home (this will require sacrificial use of the kitchen table). I have the puzzle – now I’m just waiting for winter because why would I sit inside & work a puzzle when I have a back yard to enjoy & bicycling to do?10.      Watch the rest of the Thin Man movies.11.     Go see Les Misérables in the theater.12.      Go to a Cincinnati Reds baseball game.13.     Reduce our debt by $10,000 (more would be better!).14.     Eat fast food no more than twice per week. This has possibly happened on some weeks, but I haven’t really been keeping track15.      Reduce my use of frozen dinners for lunch – no more than two per week (less would be better!). This is also a work in progress – I’m trying to take more leftovers for lunch, or eat sandwiches. 16.      Turn the computer off & crochet more in the evenings (I’ll need an action plan for this one – perhaps a buzzer that goes off at 8:00 so I have to get off of Facebook?). I did ok with this until spring – but now for some reason I’m back to my bad ways. 17.      Drink 36 ounces of actual water a day (more would be better!). I recently switched to a 25 oz. cup at work, so this is actually happening now. 18.      Do the jar of notes about good things for 2013 (Note: Find a jar for the notes). I love this! It’s so much fun to sit down at the end of the day & write something to put in the jar. Can you guess what the last one was? (Actually, getting my bicycle was the next to last – the last one was finishing a book that really touched my heart.)19.      Organize the spare room (I might have to do this in stages).20.      Get my hair trimmed at least twice! Trim #2 is scheduled for next tomorrow!21.      Finally go see my Aunt Mimi’s house & property.22.      Visit the site of Henry River Mill Village.23.      <!Visit my cousin Scottie & her husband John.24.      Find a pair of short black boots suitable for work and snow. I don’t EVEN care about this right now!25.      Text my brother once per week26.      Visit Carillon Historical Park27.      Visit Huffman Prairie Flying Field28.      Try to crochet a garment for myself (not a hat or scarf. Maybe this.)29.      Get rid of my stamping & scrapbooking things (to make room for yarn – ha!)30.     Try to grow lettuce.31.      Finally visit Rita & Mike. This is scheduled for next month – woot!32.      Meet K, J & S in the mountains like we’ve planned for two years now. 33.      Stop drinking diet drinks. This means giving up caffeine because I know I won't drink enough tea to make a difference.34.      Finally clean up all the clutter at the office (I know my boss would be thrilled about this one). Well this is definitely going to happen by December because our office is moving!35.      Make an appointment to see a dermatologist just because.36.     Finish reading the Mary Russell books. I’ve read one more – I think I have three left (of the ones I was given).37.      Cook something new once per month (yeah – I’m not aiming for the moon here – ha!). As I’ve already mentioned I totally forgot this goal. I did make something new in April. And in May Dr. M made something that I was planning to make – does that count?38.      Go through my closet with a fierce and brutal eye.39.      See Anne & Ken face to face again.40.      Write my 1000th blog post. Only 31 to go!41.      Take Dr. M to Trader Joe’s.42.      Write down all the movies we watch (so I can remember if I’ve watched the movie – sheesh!). Oops – another forgotten goal. Although we haven’t really watched very many movies since I started the list…43.      Go see Spam-A-Lot44.     Go to a performance at the Schuster center.45.      Visit Siebenthaler Fen once per season (Spring is done) 46.      Go to the NC Outer Banks47.     Write & post 40 poems no matter how bad they are.

It was just reflecting my red camera :)We have new phones at work. For some reason I like how the number 3 shows up on the screen. Yes, I waited until 3:33 so I could take a picture. Is that weird? I think that's weird :)Afternoon thunderstorm - glad I took my walk earlier!My view for most of my commute home. Sigh.When I got home Dr. M had assembled my new bicycle!

We took a short trip up to Lake Erie for the 4thand naturally took a bluemillion pictures (except that my camera died Thursdaynight – the horror! – so there aren’t as many pictures as there could have been- & only one of Dr. M). We saw a lot of different birdson our trip – barn swallows, red winged black birds, egrets, herons, ducks,geese, swans… If you want to see those pictures go to Dr.M’s post. Sunday,June 30th Dr. M & I enjoyed our annual church picnic. It’s held at the lake-sidehome of two church members. Nice!Monday,July 1st  Daylily – I wonder if thenovelty of having our very own lilies will ever wear off?I went to flip my calendar toJuly & saw something very strange.Can you see it now?

On the way welistened to Jimi Hendrix & I worked on a new shawl. The condos next to our motel hadthe prettiest flowers along the fence.We stayed at the Travelodge – very economical. The room was huge, andI loved that we were able to park right outside the door. It’s not a Four Starjoint by any stretch, but suited us to a T.Plus, this was our view!Thursday,July 4th    We drove out to Fort Meigs today. It's the site of a War of 1812 battle. Every year they reenact the July 4, 1813 celebration. They have an 18 gun salute (for the then 18 states) and 18toasts. We wanted to be there for the 200th anniversary & werethrilled that it did NOT rain while we were there – score!This was one of the threetoastmasters. That’s tea in his glass – not sherry – so he gets a minus pointfor historical accuracy. Ha! But doesn’t he look dapper? Here’s an example ofone of the toasts: “To the Day of our Freedom – Its blessings to all the world.It should admonish our ancient and inveterate enemy, Great Britain, that whatwas purchased by the blood of our fathers their sons will be ever ready tomaintain.” No offense to my British readers :)Dr. M enjoyed all the cannonfire.I also “enjoyed” it. Heh.As we were leaving Dr. M tookpictures of some of the flowers near the visitor’s center – lovely!That evening we ate perchdinners at a local tavern & then I had the strawberry shortcake –delicious! Friday,July 5th   Today we took the ferry out to Kelley’s Island. We watched one of our favorite mainland lighthouses on ourway out – Marblehead Lighthouse.The island is the site of some glacial grooves which arepretty interesting. If you look closely in this picture you can see the shorts Iwas wearing – I got quite a number of looks with these babies on. They’reactually Dr. M’s swim trunks. When we were packing I realized that I only hadone pair of shorts to take on the trip & I was NOT going to go shopping atthat late date. I really have reached the age where I just don’t care whatother people think – ha! (Although I did take the trouble to find a shirt thatmatched.)We drove around the island quite a bit – passed this houseseveral times. I think the flowers are gorgeous! Kelley’s Island always has alot of nice flowers.One of the things we did was to rent bicycles! It’s on my 50x50list (I promise to update you on that soon!) – glad to check that off. I had ablast. Unfortunately there aren’t any pictures because my camera battery had diedthe night before – and we weren’t going to lug the big one along on a bikeride! So instead, here’s this picture of me on the ferry as we’re headed backto Port Clinton. I was one sweaty chick!Sunset on our last night there.Saturday,July 6th     On our way home we stopped for dinner. I nearly fell asleep beforethe food arrived!

{"title": "Brain Dump", "date": "Tuesday, June 25, 2013", "text": "·        I’m reading this series of books about a womanwho is a forensic sculptor. She is no Kay Scarpetta (I know – not the same lineof work, but that’s what I thought she might be like). And the author iscertainly no Patricia Cornwell. This is one of those “used to be a romancenovelist wanna be a thriller” kind of deals. And they’re light & fluffy &filled mostly with women who won’t do what they’re told (the best kind of womanIMHO). BUT. Almost every other book in the series involves going to Colombia tothwart some evil drug lord. Or has a prominent character who used to fight withthe rebels. Or was a Navy Seal. I’m getting a little bored with the formula.Not only that, but the strongest epithet anyone uses is, “Son of a bitch!” Allthose Navy Seals/Mercenaries & not a single F-Bomb? Not that I like cursingin my books – it just seems odd. Of course, since I’m on book 11 of a 20 bookseries you know I’ll just keep chugging along. I’ll try to keep the whining toa minimum.·        Does anyone know the significance of this? I hadjust done dishes & was sitting outside crocheting. Dr. M went back into thehouse & found this.I didn’t put it there. He didn’t put it there. There’s notanyone else (I don’t think). Hmmm.·        I felt slightly light-headed* today heading backto the office after some lunch-time shopping. So what did I do? I drove faster.Because by jiminy if I was going to pass out it was going to be in my workparking lot, not on the street! Does anyone else do this? Does it make even theleast bit of sense? It reminds me of the time in Zambia when I was driving mymom & grandmother to Victoria Falls from Lusaka – I got REALLY sleepy so Istarted driving faster so we’d get there quicker. Aren’t we all glad I don’tdrink?·        This being Junior Warden is for the birds. We’vegot: a kitchen sink that drains into the floor, a ceiling coming down becauseof air conditioner condensation, a door that won’t shut properly unless it’sslammed, a ceiling fan that won’t work, an older congregation who can’t reallymaintain the landscaping (& no budget), and BEES. And the bees are probablyhoneybees so I’m not gonna be spraying those suckers – I’ll have to see ifsomeone will come & get them. My initial research tells me the chances areslim & we’ll just need to coexist with them – even if honey DOES drip downthe walls.OK. All done now. So, how’s your day been?*I’m fine now – this just happens occasionally."},

You can see his post about it here.Our hanging basket did very well under our neighbor’s carewhile we were gone!  Wednesday,May 29th   This little downy was enjoyingour neighbor’s feeder.Thursday,May 30th    Goldfinches! I’m so glad Dr. Mfigured out how to lure them back to our yard (got a new feeder & moved itcloser to the trees).We had a nocturnal visitor. Idon’t mind her visiting – but I hope she doesn’t get mad while she’s in ouryard!My cold is pretty much gone, butnow I’m being plagued by seasonal allergies – mostly with a dry annoying cough.Here’s what I had to say about this on Facebook: BerryBurst Flavor my considerable derriere! Sure it SMELLS like Kool-aid, but blech!Friday,May 31st  Dr. M got up early & took thismoon shot.When I got home from work Dr. Mhad surprised me by cleaning out the raised beds & planting some flowers - zinnias & marigolds! Earlierin the week he’d planted a couple of tomato plants (along with a couple ofheirloom tomatoes that were volunteers). I was so tickled! I’ve wanted to dothis for a couple of years but just never really got around to it. Thanks Dr.M! Please note the bug in the garden and a very special visitor!He also spent some time thisweek working on our cairn. You can see my post about it here.Saturday,June 1st    Thismorning Dr. M surprised me by going to get a few purple flowers to add to theflower bed. Hereare the beds – can’t wait to see them all filled out.Dr.M had also surprised me with some impatiens. And he moved one of the maple treevolunteers to the yard. And he fenced in the yarrow… A different kind of bug in the garden! Thecypress vine looking all innocent. Hardto believe that by August it will look like this!Go to Mamma Fran’s blog hereto see the blogs of all the other Project 365 participants. Have a great week! Most of our photos are taken with a 12megapixel Nikon D5000 DSLR, using a 55-200mm zoom lens. This is the camera thatDr. M takes with him most days. He also takes pictures with our old reliable 7megapixel Canon Powershot A710.  The Bug uses our new Nikon Coolpix S6200 most of thetime.

I’m sitting at my dad’s house composing this post, knowing thattomorrow we head back to Ohio & our regular lives. Which I do enjoy,usually, but compared to vacation time it will seem a little lackluster atfirst. And I’ll be spending the first week getting caught up on blogs – I’mpretty sure that I didn’t read a single post by a single person all week!Dr. M did a great job ofdocumenting each day, so I’m just going to share a select few (ha!) pictures& then let you head over to his blog to check out theothers. You’ll especially want to see his bird & lighthouse pictures I’msure. (I’m linking to individual posts below, but it might be easier just tostart here& then go forward).Saturday,May 18th    Travelday. I was hopped up on Benedryl so Dr. M drove the 660 miles by himself.

This is the view from our hotel room in KillDevil Hills – bliss!Sunday,May 19th    Today we just stayed around our hotel so Dr. M could recuperate.He took about a gazillion pictures of pelicans & other birds, which you cansee hereand here.Morning beach…Lifeguard boot camp – now THAT was entertaining to watch all week!The moon!Monday,May 20thToday we drove down to CapeHatteras, passing Bodie lighthouse on the way. We took Carolina Cow along forthe journey :) To see more lighthouse pictures & pictures from our stop atPea Island Nature Preserve (including a battle between a goose & an egret –ha!), go to Dr. M’s post here.This is why I didn’t climb anyof the lighthouses. Doesn’t sound like much fun does it?Tuesday,May 21st           On this day we drove over toRoanoke Island to check out the park there dedicated to the Lost Colony. Wewere a week too early to see the outdoor drama that they have (although wecould hear the choir rehearsing while we were there). Dr. M has a post hereand hereabout the trip, but here are a couple of pictures. I had to laugh at the descriptionof persimmons. We also visited the ElizabethanGardens. It was pouring rain for part of our visit, but still quite lovely.Sunset over the Wright Brothers NationalMonument.Wednesday,May 22nd   Sunrise – glorious! (Um, yeah,Dr. M took these – I didn’t get up early enough).We visited the Wright monumenttoday. Dr. M did a great post aboutit – you can find it here.This is my determined face before climbing up. Partway to the top.I made it! The State of the Bug –astounded!The monument.I’m so glad Dr. M suggested thatI change out of my cute sandals – these babies were much more appropriate forthat hike.Dr. M doing what he does :) The moon!Thursday,May 23rd     We drove west today, to spendsome time with our folks before heading back home. Once again Dr. M drove thewhole way himself (400 miles this time). I had to laugh when I noticed how oldour NC map is – ha! And we didn’t even move to Ohio until 1997, so this was outof date even by then. Sheesh.On our way we stopped at Edenton(go hereto see what Dr. M has to say about that). Friday,May 24th  We spent today just hanging outat my dad’s house. I took a bunch of pictures of the yard.The moon!Saturday,May 25th    Todaywe spent some time with Dr. M’s dad. I found a mulberry tree in the back yard.Dr.M’s great grandmother brought this rose bush to Lincoln County when they movedthere in the 19th century. Who knows how old it was when she movedit. Quite a family heirloom!Dr.M’s dad told us stories of working for the mill owners when he was a small boy –doing small tasks around their house so he could avoid the “real” work hisgrandmothers would have had him do. Onour way back to my dad’s house we saw these lovely wildflowers.Whew!OK, so I still have a lot of pictures on here – ha!Go to Mamma Fran’s blog hereto see the blogs of all the other Project 365 participants.

{"title": "Bittersweet Day", "date": "Monday, May 13, 2013", "text": "I joined the Cult of Creative Memories in the early 90s. Would you like to see my photo albums? No? After we moved to Ohio in the early aughts I joined the Cult of Stampin' Up (they're not the least bit incompatible, & in fact each cult encourages the other). I made cards for friends and family for about five years. Here's one of my favorites, sent to a friend who was getting ready to have breast reconstruction surgery:I stopped making photo albums when my mom died. I think I did a few more pages & then just quit. Apparently I was making the albums for her. (Well, getting a good digital camera also contributed to my lack of print picture interest).And then about five years ago I lost interest in making cards. When we moved I thought that maybe a change of scenery would pique my interest. Not so much. And so I've had all this STUFF sitting around collecting dust for all that time. I finally decided that it was time for me to get rid of the vestiges of these two cults. I am giving it all away to some folks who I know will appreciate it.I had some fun testing all the ink pads to make sure they still work. Although there was a twinge - I used to stamp the penguin on the backs of the cards I made & then write \"Danamade\" in its belly. Feels weird to know I won't be doing that anymore.And then I came to this box:It was a silly extra thing that I just had to have - it came with plastic pages where you could arrange all the pictures you wanted to put in an album & then store your layouts in the box until you were ready to put the pages together. I opened up the box to see September 2004 - the trip that we took to Lake Erie six months before Mom died.And wow it was hard to take those pictures out of that box, knowing that I'd never put that album together. Fortunately, Dr. M knew this would be a tough process, so he brought in a cow to stare at me :)Really, I'm glad to give all of this stuff to someone who will use it. And it removes that feeling I've had over the years of something left undone. And as we all know, I have a new obsession now. All that yarn has to go somewhere!"},

Wait, what? Apparently I got a little confused when I was loading the MP3 player. Made me laugh – which was a good thing on a rainy Monday morning. After Silent Night a Kevin Welch song came on and that made me think of Kieran Kane and that reminded me of this song:I got a little crush on Kieran when I first saw the video (on MTV or CMT back when they did videos?) and I remember trying to find his CD every time we went to the record store. I never did find it. What a different world that was! We had to just really enjoy the heck out of whatever we were listening to because we couldn’t just go to Amazon & download the single, or go to Youtube & watch the video over & over. I’m sure there’s some “Good Old Days” moral in there somewhere, but frankly I’m more of an instant gratification type of a person.I think I’m going to go click “play” on that video again.

Thank goodness it has cruise control!The color is a little too sedate for my tastes (someday I will own a brightyellow car – I will! Or is it I shall? Hmmm), but I’m enjoying it anyway.- It was a beautiful day today. I met myboss coming back from lunch as I was heading out & he made me promise tocome back to work. It was tempting tojust drive down to the Ohio River & hang out. I don’t know why the companycan’t issue iPads & let us all head out to the park…- With the imminent demise ofGoogle Reader I’ve started using Bloglovin’. It has some good things going forit, and some negative things, but mostly it’s working out for me. HOWEVER,there are some posts that just never show up on there. So if I usually commenton your blog & you haven’t seen me in a while, let me know.  - Here is something fascinating (Iknow, you’ve been waiting all post to read something fascinating): thatbusiness of concentrated blackcherry juice concentrate being an anti-inflammatory is TRUE! As I hadmentioned here,my doctor was concerned about my kidneys & told me to stop taking NSAIDS. SoI did.

By the time I got up there at around 6:45 Dr. M had already been at the event for over 4 hours (on campus since 7:30 or so). We grilled some hotdogs, walked the loop, waited out the cold in the tent, walked the loop, crocheted (well, that was just me), walked the loop. There was music most of the night & they had some raffle drawings. It was a pretty small event – no doubt because of the cold weather. When I wasn’t practically trotting I remembered my plan to walk mindfully. I slowed down and considered the path before me, and thought of the people I was there honoring. I’m a stomper (just ask our former downstairs neighbors – oy!), but I tried to tread lightly. Frankly, the loud music & cold wind weren’t really conducive to meditating. I’m going to try again the next time we go to our local fen. By the end of the evening I was using a cane to walk. The event was supposed to end at midnight, but other folks were packing up at 10:30, so we decided to pack up too & left a little before 11:00. Dr. M was so tired and I was pretty sure that I couldn’t feel my thighs anymore. It took about 2 hours under an electric blanket for me to thaw out. Yeesh.Then I spent the next two days in quite a bit of pain (unrelated? Not sure, really – lower back/butt/thigh pain). But today I’m feeling a lot better. I’m pretty sure I’ll survive – although at one point in the night I was not the least bit sure. So, would I participate again? Absolutely! But next time I’m going to remember my long johns…"},

We had a great 20-30 minute talk. After it was over I noticed that I had phone ear – and it reminded me of all the times my mom would get off the phone with her best friend Sue, red ear blazing. Made me smile.Saturday, April 6th    On Saturday Dr. M & I went to see the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit at the Cincinnati Museum Center. It was pretty fascinating (if CROWDED!!). I enjoyed seeing all the artifacts – it’s amazing to think of putting those broken jars together with the shards they found. We weren’t allowed to take pictures of the actual scroll fragments, but my main thought about them is I didn’t realize how small they are. All that tiny writing – makes my head hurt to imagine trying to make sense of them!As we left the exhibit we saw this artifact – ha! It was in an exhibit about the role played by Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati with regards to recovering the scrolls, etc. This is the desk of Martin Abegg. The computer is the one on which he assembled the \"bootleg\" copy of the scrolls that broke the long monopoly on full access to them.After we finished the exhibit we impulsively decided to watch the IMAX movie about the Flight of the Butterfly. VERY interesting tale about the migration of the monarch butterfly – I highly recommend it. Go to Mamma Fran’s blog here to see the blogs of all the other Project 365 participants.

I’ll have a review of how I’m doing sometime next week. - So far I’ve had to do two Junior Warden type things: purchase trash bags & tin foil, and get Dr. M to replace a hasp & lock on a door. So I think I’ve got this gig down pat now. -My doctor is concerned about my kidney function and has forbidden me to take any more NSAIDs. She’s right to be concerned - I’ve been taking ibuprofen pretty regularly for around seven years now (since my hip arthritis diagnosis). So I’m going to try some other things – including not taking anything at all. I might finally give up diet soda since aspartame has been linked to joint pain. During this process I’m going to try Very Diligently to not whine. (But I’d like to note for the record, that it’s now spring allergy season & I have a sinus headache. Ha!).-I’m realizing just how much I don’t like it when I don’t get my own way. I was practically in tears in the doctor’s office (prompting her to prescribe something that I probably won’t be taking). As I was driving home I gave myself a stern talking to. “Suck it up Ms. Bug! You just need to roll with the punches & quit being such a wuss!” -I am empty of poetry. I just don’t see the world that way anymore. For now anyway. Kind of makes me sad. Although maybe now I’ll write somber verses about pain. Something for you to look forward to!-The Braves & Reds have both won two of their first three games, which is a good thing since my NCAA bracket is totally busted. I have one team left (Louisville). All my other picks bit the dust. Next year I’m going to make my choices based on team colors & mascots. Ha!﻿ Here's a likely candidate - the Wichita State Shockers. And they're in the Final Four this year! According to this site, Wichita State got its name due to its early days, when students earned money by shocking, or harvesting in wheat fields near the university. I think they're my new favorite!﻿"},

Favorite smells?Cut grass, baking bread, cinnamon17. Why do you blog?So that I won’t bug all the people around me with all these words – they have to go somewhere!18. What song do you want played at your funeral?I don’t really want a funeral, but I figure that they’re for the people I’ve left behind - so they can do whatever they want. 19. What is your least favorite thing about yourself?My inability to let chocolate sit uneaten.20. Favorite hobby?Puzzles, crochet21.

Heckyeah I’m unhappy with my maid service!Friday,March 15th  Birds in the ‘hood.Dr. M doing one of his favorite things – maybe it willactually be warm enough to sit out there soon!Saturday,March 16th      Dr.M had to go to school today for a meet & greet. On this way home he saw ared winged blackbird singing its heart out. Love these guys.Andthe flowers that we saw last week have opened up.Whilehe was gone I made soda bread for a benefit we were having at church thatafternoon. It’s been a long time since I had to cut in butter – it takes moreenergy than I remembered!Wehad a good turnout – good food (corned beef, cabbage, potatoes, green beans,things with green icing), & good music. I helped serve & was there forabout five hours. The look on my face is “uh oh, that third cupcake was NOT agood idea!” I came home & went to bed at 9:30 & didn’t wake up until9:00 (which means I was late for church – oops!).WhileI was gone Dr. M was making our own St. Patrick’s Day soda bread. It’s verytasty. And huge! We put some in the freezer for future soda bread emergencies. Go to Mamma Fran’s blog hereto see the blogs of all the other Project 365 participants.

It’s going to be a Rude Awakening tomorrow when I have to get up for church an hour early. Sunday, March 3rd    After church Dr. M took me out to eat for my birthday. Of course, we had to meander for a bit on the way home. We saw snowdrops and buttercups (eranthis) – lovely signs of spring.Lambs were everywhere!We saw two red-tailed hawks.I didn’t get a birthday cake this year – there were too many other sweets around. This is a chocolate peanut butter cupcake from church, with fudge ice cream & French vanilla cool whip – yum!Monday, March 4th    On Monday I went to get my license renewed. When I got back I took this State of the Bug picture – surely I don’t look as bad as my driver’s license picture!Here are my last three licenses – I was amused to see my hair changes. This year’s is my least favorite.Dr. M stalked took pictures of a chickadee.And this terribly cute sparrow.Tuesday, March 5th           It started snowing Tuesday night.Wednesday, March 6th   We woke up to a winter wonderland!I shoveled the driveway (it was a wet heavy snow, but relatively easy to shovel). While I was shoveling I noticed this robin looking lost. Dr. M took his picture as he (the robin, not Dr. M) surveyed the world around him in confusion.Thursday, March 7th    We have a whole host (or quarrel) of sparrows who live in the shrubbery in front of our house.

He has been doing really well. But about 80% of the time, when I take the cap off the marker to mark the calendar, I get a dot of red on my hand.

I think Dr. M did a fabulous job getting hispicture. On Facebook someone asked why it’s called “red-bellied” instead of “red-headed.”Here is the answer: Cornell Lab explainsas follows: \"Red-bellied Woodpeckers are pale, medium-sized woodpeckerscommon in forests of the East. Their strikingly barred backs and gleaming redcaps make them an unforgettable sight – just resist the temptation to call themRed-headed Woodpeckers, a somewhat rarer species that's mostly black on theback with big white wing patches.\" Females tend to have reddish bellies,hence the name.Sunday,February 10th   The doves are back!

To give her credit, the other kids were taking a test & Ihad burst into the room all chatty-like – she was just trying to shush me. Butmy little ego was devastated. I’m sure I was told to hush countless other timesin my life, but this is the one time that I remember with clarity. Or maybewhat I remember is that clutch in my stomach, that rush of heat to my face,that blurry vision that had nothing to do with new glasses that weren’t ready.And to add insult to injury I had to take a test!Since thenI’ve spent a lot of time analyzing other people’s body language. Is that smilebecoming strained? Is she shifting restlessly in her seat? Is he screaming inhis head, “just shut up already!”? Frankly, it’s exhausting – and I’ve foundmyself more than once wishing for a mouth sized strip of duct tape.And yet Istill prattled on, about my dream last night or the way my hair is driving mecrazy or that hilarious blog post I just read, or the fact that cardinals (thebirds, not the ball players) always look like they’re in a bad mood.Just latelyI’ve been wishing that I would just shut up & let all the voices in my headhave their way for a while. That maybe if I stop talking over the top of themthey’ll get everything off of their chests & leave me alone.

It’s all very complicated, and always involves finding a file from 2007 that I can only hope will now fit in its box in the basement. Perhaps I should just create a new box called “Found 2007.” All of this hard manual labor (hey – it’s hard manual labor to me!) is reminding me that last year sometime I promised myself that I would do some sort of weight training for my arms. I think that lasted about 2 weeks. And it is now evident that it might have behooved me to keep up with that stuff. Or alternatively, to take care of this file project in a more timely manner. I’m a little concerned that I won’t be able to lift my arms to crochet anything tomorrow. Or drive. Can I file a Worker’s Comp claim if I can’t drive to work?--Dr. M wrote an excellent post about the President’s proposed gun reforms. Read it here if you’re interested. --My friend Joanne (she is our former choir director & I eat dinner with her every Tuesday) has been steadily declining over the last year and she has now been moved to a nursing home and is unresponsive. We've been told to visit & talk to her, so I'm meeting a fellow choir member there tonight - Tanya is bringing her guitar. Joanne has been near death before & rebounded & was able to move back home. So I'm not counting her out. But it also might just be time. Prayer, good thoughts, letters to Buddha - all would be appreciated. Spring 2012[Note: Joanne passed away about 45 minutes before I got to the nursing home. Her family let me go in to say goodbye.]*I had to look up the term “biyearly” to make sure I was using it correctly (I wanted to say “every two years” not “twice a year”) & I found this way to remember which will now be forever burned into my brain: “…bisexual isn't someone who's attracted to half a gender, its someone who's attracted to two genders.”"},

And now I'm adding some more - here are 26 - 35:26. Visit CarillonHistorical Park27.  Visit Huffman PrairieFlying Field28.  Try to crochet agarment for myself (not a hat or scarf. Maybe this.)29. Get rid of my stamping & scrapbooking things (tomake room for yarn – ha!)30. Try to grow lettuce.31. Finally visit Rita& Mike.32. Meet K, J & S in the mountains like we’ve plannedfor two years now.33.

And I was born in 1964. Coincidence? I think not!I’m trying to decide whether to start a war, or take some action from which there is no turning back. I’m not as adventurous as I was in my youth, so I probably won’t be volunteering to be yearbook editor (with no experience whatsoever), signing up to go to Africa, or getting married (although that might have more to do with the fact that I’m already married). What to do, what to do… Maybe I’ll cut my hair! Or, rather, let some professional person cut my hair. That’s not exactly crossing the Rubicon though, is it? If I were one of those people who write thoughtful, contemplative posts I might talk here about some personal river that’s blocking my path, and perhaps give examples of how I might ford that river (or just walk along beside it). But I’m not one of those people. Or I could write a humor piece called “Don’t Try This At Home” about my attempts to get to the other side of that river.Or I could ask you guys to talk about your own personal Rubicons & what you plan to do about them (actually, that’s a pretty good idea – so feel free to respond in the comments).Instead I’ll share a poem about a river which I posted 2 1/2 years ago (having sat here for 30 minutes trying to write a new one – argh!). The Mad River flows away from my heart's desire.The thrum of possibilitymuted under rushing water. I stand on the bankand think twice aboutwhat that means – heart's desire – and what I need.I need ice creamand contentment.I need to know thatyou want ice cream too.Or maybe not ice cream.Maybe I need whatis just down river – a sound on the edge of my ear.Caught, I stand on the bankand think thrice aboutmy heart's desire and what do I need…To plunge into that mad water,or bide on the bank,or turn and head back hometo you?"},

I sat down today & made a good start to my list. Here are the first 25.1.     Review this list every Sunday &plan which items I can do that week.2.     Go see the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibitat the Cincinnati Museum Center.3.     Visit the Leo Petroglyph.4.     Go to an exhibit at the local historical society museum.5.     Check out the SerpentMound again.6.     Make exercise as much of a habit asbrushing & flossing my teeth! (I have come up with some mini goals to make this happen)7.     Corral my sweet tooth. Your guess isas good as mine as to how I do it, but I’m going to start by writing downeverything I eat – especially since most people who lost weight & kept itoff used a food journal. I’ll reevaluate this goal in June 2013 to see howthings are going.8.     Stay in a cabin in Hocking Hills.9.     Work a jigsaw puzzle in my own home(this will require sacrificial use of the kitchen table).10.   Watchthe rest of the Thin Manmovies.11.   Go see Les Misérables in the theater.12.   Goto a Cincinnati Reds baseball game.13.   Reduce our debt by $10,000 (more would bebetter!).14.    Eat fast food no more than twice per week.15. Reduce my use of frozen dinners for lunch – nomore than two per week (less would be better!).16.  Turn the computer off & crochet more inthe evenings (I’ll need an action plan for this one – perhaps a buzzer thatgoes off at 8:00 so I have to get off of Facebook?).17.  Drink 36 ounces of actual water a day (morewould be better!).18.  Do the jar of notes about good things for 2013(Note: Find a jar for the notes).19.  Organize the spare room (I might have to dothis in stages).20. Get my hair trimmed at least twice!21. Finally go see my Aunt Mimi’s house &property.22. Visit the site of Henry River MillVillage.23.  Visit my cousin Scottie & her husband John.24.   Find a pair of short black boots suitable forwork and snow.25. Text my brother once per week.Some of these are a little more amorphous than others.

I have to say that this placement was QUITE nerve wracking because the grocery store was INSANE today! I guess the double-whammy of snow & New Year's Eve was enough to make everyone come to the store. I was amused because our store was remodeled a couple of months ago & they moved everything around. And obviously all these extra shoppers hadn't been in since the remodeling - they all just moved around in circles with confused looks on their faces. I should have been taking pictures of them. Instead, I placed my poem (after I got my two cans of peas), took my picture & skedaddled to the next aisle. Whew! Now I can relax back into my life of obscurity.Note: Hoppin John is eaten on New Year's Day for luck. Go here to read more about it.And here's the recipe I'm making tomorrow:Hoppin' John SoupServes 6 1 large onion - chopped1 tablespoon olive oil1/2 pound kielbasa -- chopped2 cans black-eyed peas -- drained1 can navy beans -- drained1 cup brown rice, cooked1 teaspoon garlic powder1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper -- optional1/2 teaspoon thymesalt and pepper -- to taste2 cans chicken brothIn a soup pot, heat oil over medium high heat. Add onion and cook till translucent.Add kielbasa, peas and beans, rice, broth and seasoning. Stir well to blend andheat. Mash beans slightly to help thicken soup (use the back of your spoon or apotato masher). Serve when hot.

We spent the whole week in NC with family – nice! [Note: I had considered not continuing with P365 next year, but I’vedecided that I will. But I might not work so hard (or, um, make Dr. M work so hard) to have a picture for every day.]Saturday,December 22nd I finished the hat I was makingfor my dad for Christmas. It’s appropriately a little large on me. We drove through some snow inWest Virginia. It was beautiful – especially since the roads were perfectlyclear. Dr. M had me taking the pictures with the window down. You know yourphoto taking is out of control when you’re taking pictures with the window downin winter while driving at 70 mph. (Um, to be clear – he was driving, I wastaking the pictures).  Sunday,December 23rd My dad’s house is a veritable cornucopiaof birds.

Monday,December 24th     Dr. M went to visit his dad& took a couple of photos. I love this giant penguin inflatable – with itshatching egg. And these geese are just toomuch – ha!I finished yet another hat –this time for my cousin’s one year old daughter. Rather than try it on my own headI used a head of cabbage for the model.We had dinner at my brother’shouse & exchanged gifts. One of my favorites is here(still makes me snicker). My sister-in-law has quite a nutcracker collection.Here are just a few.My dad, brother & Dr. Mmodeling hats that I made them.Tuesday,December 25th – Christmas DayTo read our annual Christmaspoem go here.Last month while looking at one of Dr. M’s moon pictures I was struck by the factthat Mary & I had gazed up at the very same thing. It’s prettyawe-inspiring & humbling. We spent the afternoon with Dr.M’s family. After lunch, Dr. M read the Christmas story from Luke and we sangcarols. It was a really nice time. Made sweeter by the fact that his uncle whowas at death’s door a month ago was there and doing pretty well, and the factthat Dr. M’s father came with us (he doesn’t always).

You know, there are people out there who probably had higher expectations of what I would do with my life. I was a bit of a bookish girl & enjoyed doing well in school. But my overall dislike of hard work overrode any niggling desire to Be Someone. And now is when that philosophy pays off – as a peon I don’t have to do any work when I’m not at work. Additionally, I don’t even have to think about work when I’m not at work. And my boss is off during the same timeframe, removing the remote possibility that he might contact me if he can’t find something. We’ll be travelling over the holidays so my posting and reading of blogs might be spotty. Or it might not – I never really know. I was going to just take a blog break for the rest of December, but I fully intend to put poems in shops & post about them. And then there’s my P365 post. And I’ll probably want to post about something crazy my dad does. And then our annual Christmas poem needs to be shared. So really, I’ll probably have MORE posts instead of fewer. Isn’t THAT exciting!I’ve been telling people that I’m mostly done shopping for Christmas. But that the list is in my head & I’m not entirely sure that I’ve remembered to get something for everyone. I don’t know why the list is in my head. It’s like I’m being disorganized on purpose so I can feel closer to my mom, who had a habit of hiding gifts where she couldn’t find them, or, one year, not putting names on the gifts, so sure she would remember whose was whose & then of course NOT remembering (boy was THAT a fun Christmas – my brother & I just dived in, unwrapping as fast as we could & throwing presents at each other).Speaking of diving in, there’s a meme going around where a cat is blaming the creepy Elf on a Shelf for the Christmas tree being knocked over. Sometimes it’s not a cat or a creepy elf – sometimes it’s an eager girl who just wanted to see if that package in the back had her name on it…"},

What I want to know, is how do they decidewho gets to stand on top?And now I’ll insert a mini-rant(please feel free to ignore). Twenty-six people died in a Connecticut school yesterday.Immediately people from both sides of the gun control issue started shoutingabout how this proved their side to be right. Also, some people started talkingabout this happening because we “took God out of our schools” (and I have tosay that if this is true then I don’t really want to have anything at all to dowith that God thank you very much). I’m on the side of gun control because Ibelieve the argument “guns don’t kill people, people kill people” is a bunch ofpoppycock. But I’m not going to get into an argument about that – people believewhat they believe & shouting at them doesn’t change things. I’ll just leaveyou with this prayer from Mother Barbara at The Geranium Farm: Even when we fail, when words fail, when tears fail, You willnot fail us. We turn to one another, we turn inward and in humility we turn toYou. Assist us with your grace to change our world, our nation, ourcommunities, our lives and our minds to the ways of peace and love. And when wefall short, lift us with Divine arms and hold us close until we can try onceagain.Go to Sara’s blog here to see the blogs ofall the other Project 365 participants.

{"title": "An Old Letter to My Grandmother", "date": "Wednesday, December 12, 2012", "text": "Recently I agreed to put my hat in the ring (what does that even mean?) to be on the Vestry at my church (meaning I've agreed to be nominated - the vote is in January or February). My rector asked me to write a little blurb about my Episcopal journey and what I might have to offer as a Vestry member.That request reminded me of the letter I wrote to my grandmother back in 1998 when I decided to join the Episcopal church. My grandmother was a pillar of the Southern Baptist church I grew up in. She pretty much did everything but preach there, and I was really concerned about her reaction to my decision. Why, Episcopals were one step removed from those odd Catholics! So I very nervously put in words what I was feeling...November 7, 1998Dear Mamaw:I am writing this letter to you the daybefore I’m to be confirmed in the Episcopal Church. I suppose Mom & Dadhave told you of my decision. I just wanted you to know that you have onlyyourself to blame! All of my life you have shown me how to be a woman of faith(and I must say you are a hard act to follow!). I have watched you work in thechurch, you and all the other strong women I grew up with--Lil Stepp, LillianHolsclaw, Brenda Fox, my mother, just to name a few. And I have watched thatsame wonderful welcoming church slam its doors in the face of my generation,just because we wanted to follow God all the way to the altar and beyond. Atthe time I thought, “Fine, I don’t think I can ever be other than Baptist, so I’lljust put church on the back burner of my life. I don’t really feel welcomethere with all I have to offer.” And I did put church on the back burner. For a while I attended and even joinedthe First Baptist Church of Asheville, a nice middle-of-the-road Baptistchurch. But then the minister let me down (ala Bill Clinton). So I stoppedgoing there. And a precious part of my life was missing.When we moved up here I visited theChurch of Our Saviour because I knew one of the members (the sister of one ofmy seminary friends). I went sporadically last year, enjoying the warm,friendly atmosphere, enjoying the new type of service, finding peace in thewords of the ancient church. Then I started going more regularly, thirsty forwhat I had missed during those years away from the church. Then I was asked tosupervise Sunday afternoon coffee hour goodies and cleanup. Then I was asked tobe the treasurer on the vestry. All the time I was never asked to become anEpiscopalian or join the church, just that I be there! And so I asked myself why it was that I wasthere so often, when never before have I willingly gone to church “eight days aweek & twice on Sundays.” I realized that our priest, Mother Paula, whilebeing thoroughly traditional in many ways, had a broad interpretation ofChrist’s welcome table. Everyone is welcome. Everyone.White, black, man, woman, gay, straight, alcoholic, tee-totaler, everyone.We are all affirmed and prayed for, by the congregation as a whole. And it’snot just welcoming words from the priest--everyone at church welcomes everyoneelse. During the service we “pass the peace of Christ” and we all go and hug ortouch everyone in the sanctuary as if we mean it. And we do! I feel Christ’slove in that sanctuary, in a way I never have since I was a teenager in achurch that hadn’t told me yet that I wasn’t welcome behind the altar.Because of that I have decided to jointhe church. I know it isn’t necessary. I know that I am giving up my heritage,a heritage that, while it rejected me, also brought me to Christ. But I wouldrather start a new heritage in church, than contemplate my old heritage sittingin my living room on Sunday mornings. I am so glad to have found my way again. Theleast I can do is join the people who held the light before me.I love you Mamaw, and I hope that you arehappy for me. I’ll be thinking of you tomorrow, and of all those strong women(and men!) on both sides of my family. I’m doing this because of you all.Love, DanaMamaw outside church in 1986My grandmother never really said anything to me about my letter to her. In the end I think the fact that I felt passionate about church was good enough for her."},

The time when all good poets (and I) venture forth to place poems in shops, because as you know the masses need poetry in their lives during the crazy days of Christmas preparations. And as you'll see below I'm sure my little verses warmed the cockles of their hearts (or at least made them hold their heads to one side & go, \"hmm.\").Today I went to two places. First, I was on an urgent mission to get dental floss, so I decided to share a few words of wisdom with other like-minded individuals.In case you can't read it, the poem says:Smile at the next Person you seeAnd if they tell youThat you have something               Just thereBetween your teethUse this floss.Next I went looking for some yarn for a Christmas present.Here's the poem:A needle (or two –if you are a knitter).An hour or ten – you aren’t a quitter!A scarf, a hat,a loverly shawl,mittens & sweaters –imagine them allIn front of the TV.On your lunch break at work.While your children are sleeping.Till you come to with a jerk.Everyone you know is covered head to toe.Sigh.Maybe…Your nephew’s girlfriend’s mothercould use a scarf.I do believe this puts the U.S. well in the lead in the not-competition.

I do most of my blogging at work. In between my actual, you know, work related tasks. I’m a good employee. Really!::What books were your childhood favorites? Well, obviously, Old Black Witch, because of the pancakes. And Nancy Drew & Encyclopedia Brown because oh MAN HOW COOL WOULD IT BE TO BE THEM! But really, the one that tugged on my heartstrings every time I read it was Heidi, (et al.) Sigh. :: Who is your favorite fictional character? I’ve thought long & hard about this & I’ve decided that it’s a type, not a particular person. And, despite my desire to appear to be Woman Hear Me Roar, this type reveals a deep seated fantasy that I’ve always had: I like a guy who is really nice, seems normal (& is probably a wine seller or a history professor), but knows How to Get the Job Done no matter what, even if the IRA is involved. You can find this guy in Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, or the hero of any Dick Francis novel. Yes, I want someone who can take care of me & get the bad guys. Dr. M does pretty well at the first part – time will tell about the second part! ::What is your favorite time of day and why? Wow I have no idea! I’m not a morning person, but because I have to be at work at 8:30 a.m. I can’t be much of a night person either. I kind of like my morning & evening commutes because I can listen to my audio books, but I also like dinner time because I can catch up with Dr. M about his day. But my very favorite time is on Saturday morning around 5:00 a.m. when I wake up & need to go to the bathroom – I know I can go back to bed and sleep for 3 or 4 more hours!::Have you ever Googled yourself and been surprised at what you’ve found? Yes I have. And no I haven’t. It’s all the usual stuff – LinkedIn, Facebook, Blogger…::Who would play you in a movie of your life? Janeane Garofalo. Except she’d probably have to dumb it down a little bit lot.OK, who would I like to see answer these questions? Hmm. Well, it would be cool if all of you would.

{"title": "His Name was John", "date": "Monday, November 12, 2012", "text": "All day today I’ve been trying really hard to write a Veteran’s Day poem, but really, what do I know about war and coming home from war? I know jack squat, that’s what! So I give up. Instead, I’m reposting this from 2010. ---------﻿Daddy's wife Amy wrote this essay about her first husband for the Literary Arts section of the local Senior Games this year – she won the gold medal for her effort. I know I was impressed! HIS NAME WAS JOHNArmy Serial # 14196510A True Experience of an American Prisoner of War in Germany World War IIHe walked, slowly and painfully, shuffling his tired, sore feet over the dusty ground, head bowed, eyes unseeing, just moving forward, always moving. His body was emaciated, covered with dirt and vermin, his clothes in rags, and boots worn thin. He was tired, so tired. It was tempting just to lie down and sleep for a time, but he knew he would be left to die. Some of his fellow prisoners had already fallen, too weak from hunger to go on. Hadn't his best friend dropped to the ground a few days earlier? Ignoring the guards order to move on, John turned back for his friend, carrying the limp body on his own tired shoulder until the soldier could walk again. How long had they walked? He couldn't remember, and there was no strength to dwell on anything but survival. Having endured months of interrogation, torture, cold, hunger, and fear, he would not allow the enemy to win now. After all, he was an American soldier, trained to survive in any situation, even as a dreaded prisoner of war. His shoulders straightened slightly and he moved forward with new resolve. He would survive!He was so hungry. He'd had nothing to eat for days. There was no food for anyone. His thoughts went back to the camp they'd left at Nuremburg, before their long walk into the German countryside. They'd had a little food then, a bit of moldy cheese, a raw turnip, and an occasional bowl of thin cabbage soup. How he hated cabbage! Once free, he vowed never to eat that vile tasting vegetable again. He took comfort from that decision. Glancing at the guards walking beside him, he realized that they were tired and hungry too. They were old men, too old to fight in combat, but they had guns and orders to keep the prisoners ahead of the American forces at any cost; thus the hurried movement with little sleep and less food. To help pass the time, John willed his mind to focus on earlier days in his life, before this war began. The images were vivid now. He could almost smell his mom's cooking, feel his warm bed, and see the farm with its vast corn fields, the earth warm beneath his bare feet. When he was older, he played on a semi-professional baseball team. He had a good pitching arm. There was an old car, friends, and enough money to enjoy life. The happiness he had known then surrounded him now like a warm blanket. Was it just three years ago? What had happened? Pearl Harbor! His country had been invaded by the enemy. Soon he volunteered for service, choosing the Army Air Corps. He'd always been fascinated by planes. His mind went back to the day he left for basic training, his mother's sad, tear-filled eyes and his father's rough face filled with pride as they said goodbye. He'd promised them he would return.For basic training, he was sent to Fort Bragg. Then came the rigorous routine – the skills needed for combat and survival, instilled with the mindset of a soldier, and then assignment to the elite crew of a B-24 heavy bomber. The crew was stationed in England, becoming part of the European Theatre of Operation. They worked as a close-knit team. Their mission – provide cover for allied ground troops and destroy enemy strongholds. As nose turret gunner, he was highly skilled and took pride in his abilities and in his B-24 bomber, which they had nicknamed \"Jest for Laughs.\" He remembered how they would fly out over the English Channel in the early morning fog, complete their assigned mission and fly back to base under the cover of darkness, often with just enough fuel to set down safely. They were aware of the danger involved, but nothing would happen to them. They were indestructible. Seeming to lead a charmed life, the \"Jest for Laughs\" and its crew had completed twenty six successful missions. Four more assignments and he would go home for a long furlough. It would be nice to be back on American soil in the safety of home and family for a change. Air raids, enemy fire, and exploding bombs were increasingly stressful. One day, his crew received orders for their next assignment. The briefing was detailed. If the mission went as planned, it could change the course of the war. The bombers would help clear the way for allied ground assaults, a massive invasion of strategic enemy strongholds. He knew the Germans were fierce and relentless opponents, but there was no doubt that the Americans would be successful. He was confident and ready.On Tuesday, June 20, 1944, in early morning, the crew left its base. They were all in place, John with his long frame folded into the nose turret. He could feel their strength and determination. They were a team with a single purpose. All was well.As the crew flew low over Politz, Germany their first bomb drop, he saw anti-aircraft fire. The sky around him was filled with a deafening sound. He felt a jolt as the big plane lurched to its side, then straightened slightly. One engine on fire, the bomber started a slow descent. At that time, the pilot gave the order to bail out. John's trap door was jammed. Pushing with all his strength, his head and shoulders emerged into the cockpit. Near the hatch lay the lifeless body of his co-pilot. There was no time! He was told again to jump. The pilot would go last. As the parachute opened, he looked below and saw German soldiers, their guns raised, following him down. He was scared, very scared. He saw his beloved \"Jest for Laughs\" in the distance as it exploded into flames. He knew the procedure. He would not divulge any information that would endanger even one fellow American soldier. He would only give his Army serial number. As his body hit the ground, he felt a searing pain in his leg. Looking down, he saw his pants leg soaked with blood. He had been wounded by flack.Next came the rough treatment, interrogation in a language he could not comprehend, punishment when he could not or would not answer, threat of imminent death, torture, and lies, lies, lies. Put in isolation, with little food or sleep, he was interrogated and punished daily. He was told repeatedly that the Americans would never look for him. He was presumed dead. He did not even have a name, only a number. Later, he and a dozen other prisoners were moved to a camp at Nuremburg and assigned to one small room. As staff sergeant, he was responsible for the group. Each day was recorded by a scratch on his wall, but these days were also etched in his mind. Had it really been ten months?One day, as he worked in the fields, John overheard a guard giving orders for the camp to move out quickly. The Americans were advancing ever closer. The war in Germany was coming to an end. German officers, however, were determined to keep the prisoners, as perhaps a bargaining tool. Very little time was needed for him to break camp. There were only the tattered filthy clothes on his back and a worn blanket which also served as his bed. He had no identification or any personal belongings. One thing he did have, however, was his determination to survive. The Germans could not take that from him. Just the fact that they were on the move was encouraging. He liked being out of that camp. Also, after months of infection in his leg, the flack wound had finally healed. He would never forget the kind German farmer who had wrapped the open sore in plantain, a leafy wild herb. The wound had healed quickly then. Walking was easier now. His body felt stronger and he had renewed purpose to stay alive until rescue came. He looked around at the sad, pathetic men who were left from his camp. They were so young, some only eighteen. He willed them to be strong and have courage.    A nearby noise got his attention. He turned to see that an old German guard had fallen, his rifle clattering on the ground. Without hesitation, John helped him stand again, picked up the rifle, took the man's arm and continued to walk. The other guards did not attempt to take the rifle from him. They were too tired to care.Planes were circling overhead – American planes. The prisoners waved in anticipation. Leaflets were dropped with the message that liberation was near. In minutes, John heard a loud rumble. He couldn't believe what he saw. Moving toward his pitiful group was a convoy of Army trucks. He was amazed as the trucks stopped in a cloud of dust. The 3rd Army had arrived. A few prisoners had been picked up from other camps and were already on board. He spotted the pilot and bombardier from his old crew. He felt his heart would explode with gratitude and relief.American soldiers jumped from the trucks to assist the prisoners, some of whom lay on the ground, too weak to move. Others crawled, walked, or ran toward the trucks. There was much laughter and tears. John stood, stunned, as the legendary General George Patton himself stepped down from the lead truck and walked toward him. Staff Sergeant John Sides, Army Air Corps, pulled himself erect and stood at attention to salute. Eyes moist with tears, General Patton said, \"At ease, soldier. What's your name and in what camp were you detained?\" John replied, \"Serial # 14196510, Sir!\" General Patton, grinning broadly, responded, \"I'm proud of you soldier, and I should be saluting you. Thank you! Now let's go home.\"John was overcome with emotion. He was safe now. It was over. He had fulfilled his duty as an American soldier. He had survived. The date was May 8, 1945. He was not yet twenty one years of age."},

As is the case with many Americans, I have some veterans in the family - my uncle John was in the Army, and my nephew Brandon is planning to be a veteran at some point (I know, he just started his training - it will be a while yet). And I was going to write a little bit about that, but I was looking for some other pictures and found this one, taken I'm assuming at my aunt Marilyn's graduation (or whatever you call it) at Quantico. Look at the pride on my grandparents' faces! (And look at Mamaw's handbag - I have lust in my heart for that bag).This was stamped on the back - I think that the picture was from 1961.I always thought it was just about the coolest thing that I had an aunt in the Marines. I mean, she had been in Japan - ooohhh... And yet she always seemed like a normal person to me. Normal people, signing up to do extraordinary things. I'm not sure we can ever thank them enough!"},

When we were first married & I would snuggle up tohim with blocks of ice on my feet, he was startled, but gallant about it. Ithink after almost 22 years of marriage he wouldn't be quite so polite if hefelt those chilly toeses!November 4: Brace yourself - this is going to be a long one: Today I'mthankful that our anthem (a blending of the Hallelujah Chorus & When theSaints go Marching In) went well & that I didn't start giggling until afterwe were done - so much fun! I'm also thankful that since it was All SaintsSunday I got to sing the hymn about queens in the church, which reminds me ofmy Episcopal spiritual home, Church of Our Saviour in Cincinnati, and the safehaven that it has always been for gays, lesbians & transgenderedindividuals. And lastly, I'm thankful that we put on such a good feast for theBishop's visit.November 5: Today I'm thankful for friends who are sending my niece postcards for hergeography project. And if YOU'D like to send her one just let me know.November 6: Today I'm thankful to be going to dinner with my friendJoanne so I can be distracted from the election for a few hours. I think thatit's ok to have ice cream on election day, right? To calm my nerves? No?This is from last spring - but the overwhelming Facebook response was YES to ice cream, so we had milkshakes - she had chocolate & I had banana pudding - yum!November 7: Today I'm so thankful that the election is over, and yes,most of my people won. And I voted my conscience according to my religiousbeliefs.P.S. In all the excitement Tuesday night I went to bed without washing my face, brushing my teeth OR FLOSSING! Gah!"},

It’s kind of scary, and contrary to my personality, but I’m just going to let go of “right” and move the heck on. Both of these situations involve work issues, and especially there I want Everyone to know that I Was Right. If this quality about myself annoys me, you can imagine how my coworkers feel. So I’m letting go and Making Changes. I will adjust daggonit if it kills me! [Note: It won’t kill me.]Our 17 year old washer is having “issues.” The agitator isn’t working (I think it transferred its powers to me!). So we’re considering what we’ll do about replacing it. Since this one lasted 17 years I don’t really want to “make do” with something that’s not really what we want. I am kind of excited about getting a front loading one because the washer is in the kitchen & who doesn’t need more counter space in the kitchen? I think we can limp along with our current one (washing small loads) for a bit, so maybe a new washer will be our Christmas present to each other. I’m feeling more melancholy than usual today. Some of it has to do with the first paragraph up there, because one of the issues I’m letting go felt like a personal slap in the face (I am Letting. It. Go.). Some of it is because Dr. M's uncle is not doing very well and it's worrisome. But I think that mainly it’s because yesterday was All Saints Sunday, and while I got to sing one of my favorite hymns (about queens – I know I’m not right, but it tickles me to feel like I’m acknowledging my liberal gay rights side in church), we also read aloud a list of those who have passed on before us. This year I had put my mom’s name on the list. Sometimes missing her is just so sneaky & fierce. -------------Here's the thanks: Many thanks to those of you who volunteered to send my niece postcards. It’s for a geography project & she’d really like to get one from every state, so she’s thrilled with the response.

Actually, the image I have in my head is when that awful Lord Beckett is walking down the stairs as his ship disintegrates around him in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest. Hmm – maybe since I have the image of a sinking ship in my head I’m not as calm as I think I am. I wonder how people write whole posts about one subject? I’ve always known that I wouldn’t do well writing a novel, but this is ridiculous! Not that I’m feeling very “writey” anyway – yesterday I tried to write a poem about the time I stole a grape & my mom made me go back & pay the nice lady at the fruit stand a penny for it. I know it would have been a Fabulous Poem if only I could have found the right words."},

Not only that, my coworkers were kind of laughing at my distress (which is no more than I should expect given my Drama Queen Status). #ihavefoodtoeatDid I mention that it was dark when I left the house this morning at 7:15?

I have a special touch. The new work one has been in my clutches for several days now however & still seems to be very fast. Maybe they’re making them impervious to my obstreperous magic.Dr. M posted a fabulous rant on Facebook about how the Yankees seem to be the only team in baseball that will postpone a game under the threat of rain. It does seem somewhat ridiculous to me – it still wasn’t raining two hours after the game should have started. Where’s the John Madden of baseball when you need him? A little mud never hurt anyone. I’ve been running walking very fast hither & thither lately – up and down the stairs at work, around the house (almost running down Dr. M who might be innocently hanging out in the hallway), down the street from the parking lot to church for choir practice…And I thought to myself yesterday – why, this is just how my mother always walked! Full speed ahead, short legs making short work of any distance she needed to travel. I was always jogging to keep up with her, even though my legs are a bit longer. What a tee-total blessing to be able to motor like that now. I should use this new super power to power walk…The bangs almost met their doom yesterday. Poking me in the eye – grr! Today I’m wearing a headband. Can I wear a headband for the next six months? We’ll see. I’m turning into one of those women – the ones who sit in the choir & fan themselves furiously. Whoo-ee!

Although, as is usual with me, some most of my thankfulness is a bit tongue in cheek.For example, I just took another hair-related State of the Bug picture. And I’m thankful that despite the fact that I still seem to be shedding about a cup of hair a day (really!), and despite the fact that sometimes the top of my head feels tingly & chilled for no good reason, I can find NO evidence that my hair is thinning. I know I’ve mentioned this before & promised to quit talking about it, but I’m amazed at how big a deal this is for me. Frankly I’m about ready to just chop it all off so I can quit obsessing (not really). I’m ever so thankful that something Dr. M said last night replaced the Dreidel Song in my head with Wham’s Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go. If you’re unfamiliar with either of these songs I’m not going to enlighten you. You’re welcome. But, really, of the two, the Wham song is a much better ear worm (especially because George Michael’s voice is infinitely preferable to Cartman’s!). I’m so thankful that we bought our futon, what – 15 years ago? It’s been a great place for naps, and for surgical recovery nests, and last night it was a respite for me when I couldn’t get settled in bed. Rather than continue to thrash around & wake up Dr. M, I headed out to the living room and nestled into the space where the seat meets the back & stretched my twitchy legs out as far as they would go and fell asleep within minutes. It’s better than a sleeping pill. I’m thankful that our choir director doesn’t throw things at us, he’s patient and good at figuring out how to help us sing better, and that the whole point of a choir is that it’s ok if your voice isn’t fabulous as long as you’re on the right note at the right time (sinus issues are clogging up my voice these days). I love that we’re singing John Rutter’s arrangement of For the Beauty of the Earth because it reminds me that we’re stewards of God’s creation & would it kill me to quit buying so many packaged things?What are you thankful for today?"},

Like Robin, I’m unsure what in the world is left to share. I have an “I have no shame” label for some blog posts for heaven’s sake. However, there is always something out there if I just think long and hard enough. So here goes:1. Sometimes, when I’ve stared at the blank piece of paper on my computer screen so long that I think I can count the individual pixels, I will fall into a meditative trance, and in that slightly foggy (yet warm and safe) place I wonder what it means to be so very ordinary and yet unlike any other person I know. There’s no one in the world who really knows what’s going on inside my head – including me. I am as baffled by my preferences & “logic” as the next person. 2. Take today, for example. It’s Blood Drive Day at work! I signed up last week, and today I went along at my appointed time [side note: I tried to go yesterday because I thought it was Thursday already. I was Shocked and Dismayed by yesterday’s Wednesdayness. Sigh.]. I sat on the bus getting my finger pricked & my blood pressure & temperature took and said my Blood Drive Mantra: “Please let my iron be low. Please let my iron be low.” Alas, my iron was NOT low and I proceeded to the Chair Where They STICK A NEEDLE IN YOUR ARM BECAUSE YOU TOLD THEM TO. And it was practically pain free & a total nonevent. My question is this: WHY do I sign up if I don’t really want to give? I’m going to blame my grandmother & my mother for this. Mamaw ate liver for years to boost her iron content so she could give blood. And my mother gave blood even though finding a vein in her arm was like finding a lost contact lens in a gravel parking lot. At night (I speak from experience). These women made sacrifices to give blood, so who am I to let a little needle phobia get in the way of doing A Good Thing. Oh, and I’m going to remember to vote too.3. It will come as no surprise that I’m a Democrat. I just want to say right here that I actually feel bad for my Republican friends because it’s got to be tough to feel strongly about your political viewpoint and yet they keep giving you these (unkind thought) people to vote for. I know how you feel because I remember some years where I held my nose & voted my convictions instead of the person. Of course, I’d rather you just come over to my side of the aisle instead of holding your nose… Heh.4. Apathy, lethargy, ennui, droopiness… These are all Close Associates these days. I’ll see 10:00 p.m. approaching and wonder WHERETHEHECKDIDTHELASTFOURHOURSGO? I am seriously considering setting alarms around the house to remind me to do something other than play Words With Friends. 5. I’m pretty sure that I think that kale is just about the nastiest thing I’ve put in my mouth in the last year. However, since I was the one fixing it, I will reserve total judgment. We do have to consider the (non)cook in this instance.6. The other day I wondered if having a nephew who just graduated from Army basic training means that I can consider myself a part of a Military Family.7. Periodically I consider not wearing makeup. I’m not sure that anyone else would notice, but boy howdy would I notice! Do I want to scar myself psychologically just because I don’t want to take 5 minutes to slap on some foundation & eye makeup? At this point, the answer is no.This is the point where I’m supposed to give the award to other people, but I never do. My blog is where awards go to die. On the other hand, I love learning random new things about people, so I challenge each of you to do a post sharing the same kind of riveting details that I just shared with you. No, really, your readership will be thrilled!Housekeeping Note: Did you know that “casualty” doesn’t mean “killed?” I sure didn’t. So my discussion of Antietam on Monday was slightly skewed – there were 23,000 casualties, which means killed, wounded or captured. Still horrific, though."},

As per usual, even though I have his birthday marked on several calendars, yesterday I was all surprised that the date was already here. So his card will be late. I did wish him a happy birthday on the phone yesterday, and I might call him tonight to sing atrociously (if he’s lucky he won’t be home so he can just delete the message quickly).I saw on my Today in History widget that today is the day that Joshua A. Norton declared himself Emperor Norton I of the United States in 1859. I spent some time browsing his Wikipedia page – fascinating man! I might have to write a poem about him. This is also the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Antietam. 23,000 soldiers died that day. That’s a number that’s pretty hard to grasp – but just for example, the town I live in has around 25,000 people in it. I’ve been through the battlefield – today it’s peaceful and green. Hard to imagine that long ago day when the fields were red with the blood of the fallen. And in fact, I actually try to NOT imagine it. Dr. M posted some nice photos of our Ohio. Some are repeats from my Saturday post, but there are new things too. Reading his post would be a nice antidote to considering Antietam.I have felt a few murmurings of creative thought. Maybe summer with all its somnolent ways is finally gone. Maybe."},

{"title": "Where I Was", "date": "Tuesday, September 11, 2012", "text": "This is a repost from last year...On Monday September 10th, 2001 I was knee deep in red tape. The real red tape that was wrapped around letters from Freedman’s Bureau agents in Kentucky to their superiors. I was helping Dr. M with his dissertation research in the National Archives in Washington, DC. Our strategy was to flag all of the interesting documents and then come back the next day to make copies. The stories I read made me want to weep – these agents used the word “outrages” to describe what was happening to former slaves in post Civil War Kentucky. These stories became the backbone of what I consider to be a pretty powerful work about the plight of freed people in Kentucky.Tuesday morning, September 11th, as we prepared to leave our Maryland extended stay to spend the day making copies, we didn’t turn on the television. In the car on the way to the nearest Red Line metro station we listened to a music CD. And as we grew ever more frustrated with traffic and full metro parking lots, we just thought it was a part of the mania of Washington DC at rush hour. Finally, we gave up trying to get on the Red Line and decided just to drive down the Potomac and maybe stop at the Iwo Jima Memorial to take in the view. After that, we hoped to get parked at a Virginia metro station. We weren’t in a particular hurry, as the Archives stays open late on Tuesdays. However, I was feeling rather desperate to go, so we pulled off into a park where I could use the facilities.I sprinted off & did my thing. Walking back to the car I saw a curious sight. Dr. M was sitting in one of our folding chairs watching one of the park rangers go through our car trunk. Let me just be a little politically incorrect here: as a college educated white couple with ordinary hair, no visible tattoos or strange piercings and respectable (if off the rack) clothing, we were not generally a target for random searches. This was a thorough search. I asked Dr. M what was going on & he just shrugged. I asked the park ranger & he said that he couldn’t really tell me but that I should listen to the radio. “Listen to the radio!!” So after he finished with the trunk, and while Dr. M had his turn with the facilities, I got in the car and turned on the radio. And listened.We didn’t go back to the National Archives that day. We checked out of our hotel and headed home. Not home to Ohio, but home to North Carolina to be with our families. I think we may have been in shock, a bit, but we were aware enough to notice the eerie silent skies above us. In the last ten years I’ve run the gamut of emotions: patriotic fervor, worry & dread, horror at how innocent people were treated. I applauded war and abhorred war. I wanted retribution and I cringed from the actions of retribution. Deep down at my core I just want everyone to get along. Can’t we all just get along? Sigh. I guess not, and that makes me sad. I know, it’s not that simple, but that doesn’t keep me from wishing it was.So in the end I’m left with feeling sad as I hold my little flag and listen to God Bless America during one more 7th inning stretch. How about, God bless us, every one? No?If you'd like to read the Christmas poem that Dr. M wrote that year, click here."},

There will be one more post after this one – although I might randomly post some other things as I think about them. When I first arrived in Lusaka I stayed at the Baptist Complex, which had 8 flats for missionaries as well as the guest house for visitors. I lived there for a while, and then moved out to the Baptist Seminary. I lived in the last little house on the road by myself for a while, and then with a roommate who worked with the communications ministry. Once again I'm dismayed at the pictures I don't have, but here are a few of the ones I do have. My little house and my truck I inherited Amber the Wonderdog from the previous journeymen. Under my care she got mange! I had to wrestle her to the vet a few times, but she ultimately recovered just fine. I ended up giving her away before I left to a family who really wanted a dog. My room. Note the contact lens boiler on the bed (my second one since I fried my first one).The stuffed dog was a gift from my brother my freshman year in college. I took him to have a bit of home with me – and I still have him now! Samuel the Spaniel is a well-traveled stuffed animal! My roommate Stacy is cooking something (thank heavens she arrived – she could COOK!) and the other Dana (a teacher at the American Embassy School) is laughing with her. Quite possibly at me. That would not have been unusual. Look – I made a lemon meringue pie!!! With actual lemons from my actual lemon tree! I was so pleased with myself… This is the road to the seminary. Unfortunately the camera flattened out the ruts so you can't really appreciate just how bad this road was! The state of the road didn't stop me from flying down it & raising a cloud of dust. I have no sense. But, you know, you figure out the best route around the worst of the ruts & it's kind of like a game to see how fast…. Um, I'm just making it worse aren't I? Next week I'll have a handful of pictures of the people who worked where I did. And I'll say goodbye to Zambia for another while."},

That's who!﻿Yesterday was the one year anniversary of my hip surgery. One year! I had planned to have cake, but I forgot. Fortunately I went out to dinner with my friend Joanne & had ice cream, so that was good. I still walk kind of sideways when I get tired, but otherwise I'm so pleased with my new hip. I'm walking for exercise every day and the only thing slowing me down is my natural sloth. Feeling kind of nostalgic, I looked back at some posts from last year. Here is some commentary from a post from August 31:\"...I didn’t really know when I walked into the Evendale Medical Center and sat up on the bed in pre-op that I would never feel that peculiar burning, throbbing pain again. I climbed awkwardly upon that bed, swung my legs up onto it, and that’s the last time my hip hurt in that way.Not that I’m pain free now. The eight & a half inch scar apparently will take some time to heal. And I’m doing all these exercises which, you know, can make you sore if you haven’t been working out (hint: I haven’t been working out). So my entire body aches at various points during the day.But not that one searing, jabbing, can-I-just-sit-down-now pain. That one’s gone.Can I have an amen?\"The scar is healed. My hip is great. And that's pretty darn thank-making on this Thursday."},

I picked a simple pattern, although that ended up not mattering at all. After picking the pattern I had to figure out what we would be using for fabric. I decided that mealy meal bags were just the ticket! I cut them into squares & put tape around the edges.Please note two things about this picture: The roll of pink toilet paper beside me on the floor. I had a bad cold and this was my \"Kleenex.\" Also, the picture on the table behind me is of my parents, my brother, Mom's dog, and me. This picture has traveled with me from office to office. My current office only has room for one picture so I don't have it there – but if I ever have more room it's going back to the office with me.The rest of the pictures are of me explaining and of the women sewing. I thought I did an ok job. However, the next morning some of the women brought their work to me to review. It was some of the most beautiful embroidery I had ever seen. Embroidery is not cross-stitch. Hmm. I think my career choice as NOT A TEACHER was the correct one LOL. Sadly, I didn't take any picture of the embroidery. Just look at those ginormous glasses! I usually wore them when I traveled if I wasn't sure about electricity (I had to boil my contacts each night in a special contraption. No, I didn't even consider going a night without boiling them.

I know, I know – why? I promise – there will be some more next week. But this week I want to talk about some of the documents I required to live in Zambia – besides the obvious passport and work permit.First of all, I had to have an Aliens Registration Card. At the time I had not ever heard of a non-citizen of a country being referred to as an alien so I thought that was hilarious. I was an alien. Heh.  Before I came to Zambia I was issued an International Driving Permit.However, not too long after arriving I had to apply for a Zambian driver's license. Boy that was a process! Forms and going to multiple offices, and then at the end, an oral exam along with the other missionaries who were applying for a license. I was asked what emotions might cause a person to drive carelessly. I said rage or anger or sadness. Nope, none of those was the right answer. The right answer was joy! The examiner said that a very happy person doesn't pay attention to the road. At the time I thought that was a very funny answer, but later I learned better. My only speeding ticket was a few weeks before my wedding 21 years ago. I was barreling down the road singing to Amy Grant at the top of my lungs. I was going 82 mph. In a 55 zone (it had just changed from 65, but still!). Thankfully I didn't lose my license. Anyway, I managed to pass the driving exam & received my Zambian license!A couple of other ladies and I decided to get memberships to the Intercontinental Hotel pool. We decided to say that we were a family so that it would be cheaper. Yes, I see the irony that two missionaries and a teacher at the American Embassy School (whose name was also Dana!) were cheating. I even feel somewhat ashamed about it now. In any case, we got our membership. I always laugh when I see the name – Mr. & Mrs. Damawallace. My name was Dana Wallace. Apparently I was taking the fall in this caper.The last document is my membership card to the Bulldog Den at the local marine base (? I have no idea what it was called – these were the marines assigned to the embassy). We would go to watch movies, eat popcorn and flirt with marines. I saw The Princess Bride there for the first time – one of my favorite movies of all time (next to Joe vs. the Volcano). And I got a date to the Marine Ball with one of the marines from Michigan. We also played softball with the marines (I use the word \"play\" loosely – I am no athlete). One of the guys was from eastern NC and I loved hearing that voice from home. His accent was so thick that the other marines couldn't understand him over the radio. Made me homesick, a bit.Come back next week when I talk about my attempt to teach cross-stitch at the Women's Missionary Union conference. Not a pretty picture!"},

I was awed today by God's creation: The grace and beauty of giraffe, the cumbersome dignity of elephants, the absolute elegance of zebra.Tonight while we rode into what seemed like darkest Africa I could feel the vibration of a million living things. Every tree we passed was pregnant with life; the rustling grass hid lions & tigers & bears – oh my! Once we passed a baobob tree and the sound of the landrover echoed against it – it sounded like a waterfall was trapped inside the tree.I tried to be very blasé, as if game viewing was something I did every day, but the sight of my first giraffe and a baby elephant and a zebra shining in the African sun and the baby hippo climbing out of the water with its mother – ah, how could I not be moved!I very much enjoyed being a tourist – even though we had to get up VERY early to explore. Here I am in all of my 6 am glory.I was quite fascinated with the \"sausage\" tree.Here are a couple of pictures where you may or may not be able to see animals. Apparently my camera's zoom feature left a bit to be desired LOL.The elephants were funny - & slightly terrifying. One of them was very interested in the landrover. Thank goodness it ultimately decided that we weren't really all that interesting!Looking back at my documentation of this trip is when I really wish I'd had a good digital camera (something that probably didn't exist in 1987 – or if it did was prohibitively expensive). Or, you know, a good regular camera* that I knew how to operate. Who knew? I was going to do mission work, not take pictures. Sigh.*Please note that the camera I took to Africa was a really good point & shoot camera of its type given to me by my church. I was thrilled with it - & it took great basic pictures.

So mostly there are pictures of bush & trees where there may or may not be animals – except for the elephants – they showed up quite well!Anyway, on our way to the park we stopped in a village near Chipata. This is the kind of Africa that all my friends were expecting. I kept telling them \"I live in a city!\" but this is what they wanted to see. Huts, dirt…People carrying things on their heads…What I saw were smiles. And lots of hard work. See the little girl pounding the grain? Hard work.They let me try. It wasn't pretty. At all. Embarrassing, really. I should never, ever complain about typing a letter at work. Or cooking a meal. Or shopping for groceries. At least I gave them something to laugh at."},

{"title": "A Day in Pompeii", "date": "Friday, July 6, 2012", "text": "Yesterday Dr. M & I decided to head down to Cincinnatito check out the newest exhibit at the Museum Center.As most of you are aware, Pompeii was destroyed by a volcano back in the olden days (79 A.D.).I enjoyed exploring the exhibits & checking out the artwork that has been excavated from the scene.And I enjoyed hearing about the lives of the people who lived there - it was a city of about 20,000 people!They ate out a lot because many of them lived in apartments without kitchensPlumbing items!The little spoon was used to mix cosmetics - all of the items in this case were related to that. Burial itemsBut the further we went into the exhibit the more disturbed I got. The story stopped being about an ancient city's destruction, & became more about the lives of actual people who were destroyed in just a few hours. Carbonized loaf of breadThe person who baked it never ate that beautiful loaf of bread. The people who died were never buried with their tokens. There is a short film reenacting what happened the day that Mt. Vesuvius blew. I don't think there was anything left alive to witness that final scene of destruction. Over 13 FEET of ash covered the city.The next room showed body casts of people who had not fled the city. It was heart wrenching. I couldn't bring myself to take any pictures of them.But because I am the Bug, I was able to recover myself once we hit the gift shop. Am I ready for my world to go up in flames (it's sure been hot enough!)? I think so![Note - low light, no flash photograph = less than stellar pictures!]"},

We roasted marshmallows! We each ate three & felt slightly illafterward. Next time we’ll just go with one or two each.  I look stoned in this picture, but I promise it was just the sweetness of the mallow getting to me. Heh.I’msix pounds down in my weight loss journey so far. That’s right – it has onlytaken me 5 weeks to lose 6 pounds. Actually, I guess that’s right in line withthe recommended rate of weight loss. But it sure seems a lot of work for alittle bit of return. On the other hand, I can now check “moves at least 30minutes per day” on the intake form at my doctor’s office instead of“inactive.”Ithought this was a good idea at the time; however, in practice it mostly makesme crave split pea soup. That can’t be good, can it? I’m taking the bottle to acoworker tomorrow – her 4 year old daughter will love this shade.

Anyway, on this particular occasion we were having a going away party for one of the missionaries and a volunteer. We had a great time with a meal and a program. I was innocently enjoying all the fellowship. Then I was told to go outside to look at my truck (a Toyota double-cab). This is what I saw:Yes, that is newspaper filling the double-cab truck.I had some help with the cleanup. The whole mission had been saving up newspapers for weeks.I got distracted. What?

{"title": "Sundays in Zambia - Visit from Home", "date": "Sunday, June 24, 2012", "text": "This post originally appeared in December 2009.I think I mentioned before that I would probably skip around some with these posts. I always think of my mother a LOT at Christmas, so I decided to skip to the visit that she & Mamaw (my dad's mother) made to Zambia while I was there. Most of the text of this post was written for the photo album - I'm just cutting & pasting. Although I'm going to add a couple of bits that I left out the first go round.Mom and Mamaw came to visit for two weeks in January 1988. We had a wonderful time—even though finding food for them to eat was a challenge (well, it was a challenge when the missionaries didn’t feed us). I took them to Kitwe to meet a missionary couple from NC. I also took them to Victoria Falls. We had great adventures on that trip:Let’s see, first on the way there I had to give a soldier from one of the checkpoints a lift…I sang the national anthem while I was driving: “Stand & sing of Zambia, proud & free.” I think he thought I was a little strange. Hoof and Mouth disease was prevalent in the country at that time, so along the way we had to stop to place our naked feet into a tub of grimy looking water that supposedly had disinfectant in it. Eww!Then when we were almost there I started feeling really sleepy. This made me want to drive very fast (reportedly 170 kpm, but that can’t be right!) to get there quicker. I thought Mom & Mamaw exercised great restraint when all they did was ask if I wanted to stop & rest awhile. Oh yes, I wanted to stop on a deserted road in Africa when night was approaching…  Note: Mom wrote this on a postcard to Daddy: Can't believe it, not one fuss - even about her driving. I close my eyes a lot...Then we went through a little drive-through game park where there were reportedly lions lurking. We didn’t see any--& it was a good thing since we got stuck in the mud. We had to get out & put rocks under the tires to make the Kombi budge… Then when I took them to the market in Victoria Falls Mom pulled out U.S. $ & the little ladies there went crazy—“Come here amai—I have some beautiful goods here!” I told Mom that it was illegal to spend American money here & the ladies just laughed and laughed. They enjoyed seeing me scold my mother. We stayed in a nice cottage while we were at Vic Falls. Mom & I sat on the porch and talked late into the night. The next morning I counted 30 mosquito bites on one leg! I stopped counting at that point. The infamous \"mosquito porch\"  The top of the smoke that thunders - with the ever present rainbow...  Mom & Mamaw climbing to the platform on the Lookout Tree - you could see the falls from there  Pretty impressive!  Me! Back in Lusaka, we went to a local zoo (a very sad speciman of a zoo) and I took a couple of pictures.Mom at the zooMamaw watching one of the missionary kids pet a deer.One of the missionaries took us all to a local church & then on a tour of the city. She found a place where Mom could (illegally - cameras were NOT allowed downtown!) take a picture of the skyline. After church - Mamaw, my housemate & me to the right of the pictureI loved having them there--& not just because they cleaned the oven & refrigerator while they visited. I was glad to have someone back home who had seen and would understand…Mom writing postcards with my housemate's cat Mpingo."},

We played a string game where we worked in pairs trying to extricate ourselves from each other. That was hilarious. We went on a boat ride.

AND he bought me new gardening tools the other day – I’m planning on planting some more flowers. That way I’m adding an upper body workout to my regimen. I am bereft of poetry lately. Every time I try to write something the words are just not there. I think that I’ll enjoy the quietness in my head & watch the world in our back yard for a while."},

We got our menus...Isn't he cute & innocent looking?I opened mine & this is the first thing I saw:Not cool Big Boy. Not cool at all. Oh hot fudge cake how I love you so! You'll be glad to know that I resisted temptation - I had the soup & salad bar. And it was good people.

Suffice it to say that there were canceled flights, icy airports, lost luggage, coin operated showers, and sleeping on top of carry-on bags involved. I thought that perhaps you might be wondering when is she ever going to post some pictures of Zambia? Is this, or is this not, supposed to be a Sunday in Zambia? Okay, okay, here you go!One of the first things I had to do once I arrived (other than learn my actual job & borrow clothes from my house-mate Rebecca until my luggage arrived) was to find a church. I know! I was amazed that I wouldn’t be able to sleep in on Sundays too! I visited a lot of different churches, or maybe two. There was the bigger congregation where the pastor was one of the missionaries. It had a lot of diversity – missionary families and Zambians. But it reminded me too much of the churches back home. I wanted something different. And there was the church where Rebecca taught Sunday School – a tiny concrete block with a dirt floor. There was a lot of joy in that church, but they didn’t really need me. I ended up going to the small informal Bible study that the campus ministry missionary had for the University of Zambia students. They wanted me to play piano. I was adequate not too bad TERRIBLE. And I wasn’t very good at teaching or leading Bible studies either. Really, what I was good at, was my job. Witnessing & what one would consider to be traditional mission work? Not so much. I’ve always wondered what strange magic made the Foreign Mission Board pick me for this work. Perhaps that magic was God.I didn’t take any pictures at the student center (what the heck!), so here are some pictures from the church where Rebecca taught."},

Here I am waiting for Dr. M outsidethe fort – doing my traditional thing of trying to avoid the cannondemonstration. Then we went to BonaventureCemetery. It looked appropriately southern cemetery-ish. This bench was at Johnny Mercer’sgrave.

He’s leaving for basic training in July – which makes mesad and proud.Saturday,May 26th   I spent some time with my brother this morning. He got my sisterin law this tiny Yorkie puppy for her birthday in April. She is so cute! (OK J,you’re cute too, but I’m sorry, the puppy wins).Dr. M drove me by so I could see the sheep in person :)Then we headed over to see Dr. M’s dad again.

All the pictures are being scanned from my scrapbook pages - just in case you wonder about the odd shapes, or captions.Although I don’t plan to necessarily go in chronological order, I decided that I would start near the beginning for this week’s post. My fellow journey-folk & I had 6 weeks of boot camp, er training, in Virginia in the summer of 1986, then were sent home to get ready to head to our respective countries. I was in awe of the folks headed to China & West Africa – those destinations seemed a lot scarier than mine. I was assigned to work in Harare, Zimbabwe – I wasn’t even going to be in the bush! Zimbabwe denied my work permit – rightly saying that they didn’t see why a Zimbabwean couldn’t do the work of secretary-bookkeeper. I waited for four months before the Foreign Mission Board was able to find me a new assignment – Lusaka, Zambia. I found out in November – and after sending all of my paperwork to the Lusaka Baptist Mission twice (they obviously needed my services LOL), I set out on my grand adventure on a plane flying out of the Charlotte, North Carolina airport. Here is what I wrote in my journal that day:Tuesday, January 13, 1987I feel very alone now. God, are you there? Give me strength. Strength to face my impracticalities and do something about them. My carry-on bag will not fit – so I must check it in Atlanta. Why does that bother me so much? Because it makes me feel foolish and I don’t like feeling foolish.Saying goodbye is so hard. I can see Mom & Dad standing at the window and that’s when I start to cry. I’m not supposed to cry – this is my adventure. A year and a half isn’t so very long. It’s time for me to grow up.Sometimes I wonder if I set things in motion just because I know I won’t stop it – and I know it’s good for me. Is this really God’s will for my life? Can I really know the answer?I ended up being able to carry my bag onto the plane in Atlanta – the stewardess was VERY helpful. And this was a good thing, because the airline lost my luggage. But that’s a story for another day…"},

{"title": "Sunday's in Zambia - The Beginning", "date": "Sunday, May 20, 2012", "text": "Two and a half years ago I started a regular Sunday feature regarding my adventures in Zambia. I decided that I would resurrect the series this year. There are 15 segments. Who knows, I might even add something new this year. If you'd like to read ahead, just click on the \"Zambia\" label on my sidebar.I went to Zambia as part of the Journeyman program of the Southern Baptist Church. It was a program designed to use recent college graduates to fill temporary support positions in the foreign mission field. I was the secretary-bookkeeper for the Baptist Mission of Zambia from January 1987 until July 1988. Later I’ll provide more detailed info about what I did & experienced while I was there, but first I want to talk about who I was.Based on what I remember (or don’t) from that time I have to conclude that I was a shallow, unobservant silly girl. I was pretty good at my actual job, but I didn’t have a lot of life experience and I didn’t know how to be really present in the experiences I was having. I was a flibbertigibbet & wasn’t as mindful as I could have been. I had discovered boys while I was in college (late bloomer here!) & I wasn’t done with them yet. I was 22 going on 16. Get the picture?Over 10 years after I returned from Zambia I created a scrapbook (actually two rather large volumes) trying to recreate my experience there. The following is a poem I wrote when I completed the albums. I decided to use it in my first “Zambia Post” as my disclaimer.Who was that girl?Superficial… Boy crazy…with an occasionalflash of insight.I hardly rememberheror what she didthat long agotime in Africa.These are theimages she broughthome with her.These are her stories –remembered as in a dream edited by timereconstructed to suit myself.This is her bookand mine tooWhoever we are!Dana Wallace RhyneMay 17, 1999"},

We did have tomatoes growing in that bed last year, so this must be from one that fell off the vine. I can’t wait to see how it does!We saw our new nocturnal visitor again last night. She’s awfully cute in an “I’m-not-going-anywhere-near-her kind of way.” We’ve named her Skunky, and we hope she’s just chunky & not “with kit.” (Yes, I did go to the google to find out what you call a baby skunk).I started a new crochet project over the weekend. Oh my head! I must have unraveled the thing about five times (I lost count). I think I might be on the right track now, but we’ll see how it looks when I’m done. It’s supposed to be a hat. Supposed to be.I had a revelation about myself yesterday. Although I hate to get out of bed in the mornings, once I’m up, I’m wide awake & ready for action. Drives Dr. M crazy (he’s of the don’t talk to me until I’ve had a pot of coffee ilk). I’ve often wondered why I’m so chatty at home. I’m supposed to be an introvert for heaven’s sake. Yesterday I realized that I’m talking to myself – Dr. M is just there to keep me from looking crazy. When he reads this he’s going to think that everything is clear now. I don’t think he’ll be any less annoyed though.I’ve at long last reached the conclusion that my hair is not straight. I’ve said it was straight for years, but it’s time for it to come out of the closet. It’s not wavy either. It’s really just bendy (and yes, that analogy is making me uncomfortable too, so forget I mentioned any closet). What I want to know is, where are the hair products for bendy hair? They probably already exist and I just don’t know about them. I already use this and it’s amazing (thanks Nurse Rudee), but my hair still looks straggly by the end of the day.

Very nice (you should go check it out). And that got me to thinking about how I’ve read that “so & so’s version is ok, but nothing matches Jeff Buckley.” Since I’d never heard his version I decided to check it out. Hmmm. Not so much. I like those young ladies in the version above. And I like these guys’ version pretty well. And of course, k.d. lang sings the version as far as I’m concerned. But Mr. Buckley’s version doesn’t knock my socks off. I know you’ve been waiting on pins & needles for my opinion. Thank goodness you can stop worrying about it now.I just reread the first paragraph & the word “version” stands out as being a tad overused. Version version version. It’s actually kind of fun to say. Go ahead – say it. Use the Mr. Burns (The Simpsons) voice. Version. I feel like I’ve got short-timer’s disease. You know – someone’s about to retire or change jobs & they just go ahead & check out early? We’ll be heading to the beach in 11 days. But who’s counting?  Then we’ll spend some time at the Daddy & Amy B&B. I’m kind of excited about the whole thing. We had our first choir anthem with our new director this past Sunday. We weren’t perfect, but we killed the last verse so everyone thought we were awesome. Same choir members, but a whole new sound. Turns out that it is better to have an actual person leading the choir. I don’t think I realized just how much we missed our old director, who retired after Easter last year. I wonder if the new guy will have us singing Hallelujah? Actually, I don’t consider Hallelujah to be a religious song at all, so I’m thinking not! Here – I’ll let you decide for yourself."},

And there’scertainly no brain left to write anything for this space. Of course it’s notkeeping me from writing whatever this will end up being. The other morning I fell asleep after Dr. M’s alarm went off(I get to sleep a half hour more). During that brief time I dreamed that myfather-in-law was really worried that I would be late for work. And of coursein the dream I couldn’t find the shower – and when I did find it, it was filledwith other people. This is pretty typical – except for the presence of myfather-in-law, which was quite odd because he doesn’t usually find his wayinside my dreams. However, his worrying about me getting to work is typical – he’s a worrier. I helped Dr. M mow the yard yesterday. Here’s his Facebookstatus afterward: “Giving a shout-out to my wonderful wife who helped me mow thelawn! A year ago, she was struggling to walk. Now, baby's got a brand new hip!Going to take that thang for a spin, soon, sinking our toes into some beachsand ♥” I used to mow a lot when I was a kid – and atour first home after we were married – but it’s been a while since it was aregular part of my life. I plan on using it for exercise purposes this summer –ha!We’ve planned a trip to the beach at the end of the month.Then we’re heading to NC to celebrate my father-in-law’s birthday. Hey – maybe that’s why I dreamed about him. I wonderif my head will still be attached to my shoulders then?

And I have a good life! But this morning, as I was fighting the alarm for the umpteenth time (I am not a morning person!) I started wondering – how long have I been living counter to my body clock? I’ve been working a 9ish to 5ish job on a regular basis since January 1991. I’d of course had jobs before then, but either they were in Africa (that wasn’t a job – it was an adventure!), or worked around my school schedule. So 1991 was my first real job. Of course, I had to do the math. That’s 1111 weeks of working (not counting holidays & vacations). I’m thinking of the “good old days” when a person (usually a man) put in his 30 & retired. I’ve got 9 more years to go for my 30 – but I won’t be retiring. For one thing, I haven’t been at the same place for all those years. I just had my 10th anniversary at my current company – that’s the longest I’ve ever worked anywhere. Oh it all just makes me too tired to think. Last night I thought – I don’t really want to win the lottery this week – it would just be too much to mess with. Maybe next week. Now that’s tired.So I’m thinking that, since my job & my life are actually pretty swell & stress free, perhaps it’s those ole’ devil hormones talking. Can somebody tell me again when I get to be done with that?I’m too tired to be the Drama Queen. Can I be the Drama Dowager* instead?*the non-widow variety!"},

Frankly, I hope it's not me - I need some rest!   I've been looking forward to baseball season FOREVER (as you may or may not have noticed). But it's dawning on me that unless something changes, the Braves won't be all that this year. I mean, I'm still singing, \"...and the home of the Braves...\" in my car in the mornings, but there's more of a question mark at the end now (\"...and the home of the Braves?\"). On the other hand, my adopted team, the Reds, seem poised to have a most excellent year. They just signed that surly cutie Joey Votto to a long term deal (he even has his own cereal now!) & they still have that ebullient cutie Brandon Phillips. So there should be some baseball enjoyment this year.   To totally flip this post on its head, I'd like to mention that it's Easter weekend. I've already been to a Maundy Thursday service (foot washing!) and tonight is Good Friday. Both of these services are somber as we consider the events of the last days of Jesus' life. And I find it so ironic to be focused on this, the greatest advocate of the poor and sick in human history (where do you think Mother Theresa learned her stuff?) during a time when the poor and sick are being swept away by what some people consider righteousness. Can we really celebrate resurrection on Easter morning while \"the least of these\" are still dismissed as inconveniences? What Would Jesus Do? Really - what would Jesus do?"},

{"title": "Mawkish", "date": "Tuesday, March 27, 2012", "text": "I feel beat down and sad. Consumed by lethargy. Annoyed with myself, God, and any number of other people (the cast list changes on an hourly basis). Um, I mean the “other people” cast list changes. God & I pretty much stay the same. I’m pretty sure that these feelings are 75% hormonal and 25% disappointment in my own self. I don’t want to go into what’s wrong because I want to wallow & if I tell you guys then you’ll just be all, “it’s ok” and “buck up” & stuff. On the other hand I HATE it when bloggers talk about their feelings but don’t tell what’s going on. Because I’m extremely nosy that way. So, I will whine for just a few minutes & hope that I get it out of my system. And you can be all supportive, but I think I’ll ignore you for a few more days & then come back & read the comments when I’m ready to start feeling better. Ha!I’ve been singing this hymn every morning in the car for about a year now. I finally worked up the nerve to sing it as a solo at church this past Sunday. I thought it sounded decent during choir practice. But when my big moment came I could barely get a squeak out. Was I nervous? Not really. What happened is that I requested that I sing the solo during communion so people wouldn’t just be sitting in the pews staring at me. So I had communion first & then went to stand by the organ to sing. And the bread was kind of stuck in my throat. I really needed a big sip of water, but there wasn’t any, & I had already started to sing before I realized that I needed to clear my throat. I was SO disappointed! My Baptist roots are telling me that’s what you get for being prideful. But I don’t think I’m all that prideful about my voice – it’s just really kind of pleasant & I thought the song suited the moment. So I’m having a bit of a theological war inside my head & truth to tell I’m mostly angry at God. What about “open my lips & my mouth shall proclaim your praise” didn’t God get? Hmm?Obviously, if there’s a next time, I’ll sing during the offering instead of after communion. But I’ve got to get over being mad & humiliated first. P.S. I always work the The Free Dictionary word match puzzle every morning. In the list of words today was lugubrious, which matched with mawkish. LOL! That’s it! I’m feeling rather mawkish. I’ll let you know when I get over it."},

{"title": "I Got Tagged!", "date": "Thursday, March 22, 2012", "text": "FOREVER ago a couple of bloggers tagged me and I completely forgot that I meant to respond. The first person who tagged me was That One Girl from Life Along the Way. I was supposed to tell you 11 things about myself, then answer 11 questions, & then tag other folks. Then later Bruce from Oddball Observations gave me the Versatile Blogger award. In that one I’m supposed to list 7 things about myself & then tag other people. Well, I’m not going to tag other people. Instead I’m going to insist that you go visit That One Girl (either here or at her gardening blog) and Bruce, here. Thanks guys!OK, first 11 things about myself (or, as a versatile blogger, 7 things PLUS 4):1.       I recently taught myself to crochet (using youtube videos mostly) and now yarn bag is out of control. It’s getting heavy!2.      I’m pretty worried about what the summer will be like since spring started so early.3.      I’ve mentioned this on here before, but since I have some newer readers, I’ll mention it again. When I was a little girl & didn’t like boys, all my Barbies had illegitimate babies because I’d heard that that meant they didn’t have fathers. So my Barbies didn’t have to mess around with boys. Oops.4.      I had tubes in my ears as a child & never learned to swim properly.5.      I had a crush on Encyclopedia Brown and the Colin kid from The Secret Seven books (I think – I just spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to find a children’s mystery book series with a character named Colin in it – but this is a British author & I don’t remember knowing that the kids were in England. Would these books have been in my North Carolina library in the 70s?).6.      I’m afraid of dogs.7.      In my head I’m a no nonsense plain jane, but in reality I’m kinda girly.8.     I’m having trouble coming up with more stuff to say.9.      I’m really sad that I’m almost at the end of the Barbara Holloway book series, & I’m pretty sure that there won’t be anymore.10.  La la la la…11.   Oh! I used to be a decent ping pong player. I haven’t played in years though. Whew! OK, now to answer the 11 questions:1. If you could go back and do something in your life over, would you? Sure there are things that I might wish I had done differently, but I like where I am & would I be here if I’d majored in English instead of Accounting? Here’s something that probably wouldn’t have changed the course of my life: If I’d known better I would have asked the caterers at my wedding to pack TWO baskets of food since sleepy little Lake Lure was already in bed by the time we got there for our honeymoon & there wasn’t anywhere to get dinner. 2. What is your hidden talent? I’m a blogger - do you honestly think that I would still have a hidden talent? Ha! Well, ok, I can make origami cranes – the kind where you pull the tail & the wings move. 3. If you could change your name, would you? If so, what would you change it to? When I was in the 2nd grade I asked to go by my middle name – Marie. But I’m ok with Dana now. 4. What is your favorite childhood memory? Wow this is a hard question! Hmm – that Christmas that Mom didn’t write any names on the presents & Joe & I had a free-for-all – that was fun :)5. What is your favorite adult memory? My wedding day.6. Do you have any pets? Dr. M! (I know, I say this every time – but it never gets old to me- ha!). 7. What size shoe do you wear? 6 ½ US Women’s8. If you could meet one person, past, present, or future, who would it be? The historical Jesus. 9. What is your biggest fear? Not having enough money to pay our bills.10. What is your favorite meal? This is totally not fair! It depends on what mood I’m in. Maybe it’s pizza, or Mexican, or livermush & eggs. You just never know.11. Which is better? Chocolate, Vanilla or Neapolitan ice cream? YesOK, go visit my friends. Heck – check out all the blogs I follow :)"},

I got my sack ‘o Girl Scout Cookies & didn’teven open it (I know even I’m shocked bythat). And I added sliced almonds to my dish of chopped apple & banana& my goodness I thought I was already breaking the rules – so yummy!·        Byfar the easiest of the three practices is the rosary – both because I wasalready doing it about 50% of the time, and because it’s a nice peaceful way toend the day. No issues there.·        I’msinging one solo verse (a cappella for heaven’s sake!) on Sunday morning &I’m a wee bit freaked about it. Especially because it’s the opening music – thechoir is going to process down the aisle to my hopefully not flat dulcettones. Gah!·        Ilast washed my hair on Tuesday. Today I pulled it back with a barrette tominimize disgust. And I’m wondering if I can go another day. This is one thingthat doesn’t suck about getting older – I’ll bet another few years & I’llbe down to washing my hair once a week.·        Knowingthat the Braves’ pitchers & catchers reported on Monday is like back whenwe lived in Fairfield & we were driving back from NC & saw the“Cincinnati 75 miles” sign on the interstate. Home is so close we can taste itbut there’s still another 2 hours to go. Sigh.

{"title": "Just Because...", "date": "Thursday, February 2, 2012", "text": "Bev, 2011Speaking of being controversial, here’s a guest post from my friend Bev. Actually, I read it on her facebook page this morning & asked if I could steal it. I thought that it would be appropriate in light of the decision that the Susan G. Komen Foundation made to defund Planned Parenthood.Bev & I went to high school together & when we reconnected on facebook I learned that she is a breast cancer survivor. She’s a fabulous feisty friend, who wants to save the world and her own life. She’s also a fabulous artist – go here to check out her work. And buy something! Her current job status is “Environmental Activist at Indentured to Breast Cancer”She wrote this for her running community in 2009. (The emphasis added is mine)I see it everywhere I go. It’s a race for something….In 1996, shortly after my 2nd child was born, I realized there was a time-bomb in me. At 33, it didn’t have a name yet, but it got me running. It started with entering a local road race. I had so much fun that I wanted more. I lived in a small town and road races were few and far between. So, I found myself driving an hour to Charlotte, NC for the chance to run more races.I didn’t care what for. I wanted that coveted prize – the T-shirt! Okay, when I got edged out on an age group award, I became obsessed. But admit it! We all do. We all stand around with our buds to the end to see if we got it. We have all checked with race chairs to make sure our times were right. But that’s what we do! We run in the rain, hot sun and slushy snow for a chance at the 3rd place medal. I couldn’t wait to be a master runner because there’re more chances to go home with something!I found myself running for everything imaginable. But I never imagined any of it would ever affect me.Then it happened. I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 35. One of my running buddies said, “You’ll have to run one of those races now where they hand out pink hats.”What? A pink hat? I need to get me one of those! So, with the power of the Internet, I found one! A race that vowed to find a cure for breast cancer. And I would get a pink cap! Sign me up! Six weeks after a mastectomy, I drove the kids and myself to Raleigh to run in my first Race for the Cure. I stayed overnight with cousin Joel and the adventure began. The next day, my world changed forever. I won! I won 1st place breast cancer survivor!You know I was hooked! I have two containers of T-shirts from everywhere to prove it!That was 10 years ago, and though I must say, there have been some advances, changes in theories, enlightenments that have lead to pink ribbons on everything you can imagine, and scores of runners, walkers, fundraiser and even MEN, yes, MEN, adorned in pink, not much has changed. I am a runner who had t-shirt envy. Now that I’ve run out of storage for my t-shirts, and I have a few medals strung with pink rather than red, white and blue, I need another motive to run through slushy, cold water running down the curb. You know. The kind that soaks your entire shoe and makes the rest of your run miserable.Don’t get me wrong. We all owe a lot to everyone who pinned a bib onto that t-shirt. But advances in treatment and detection of this ailment are not doing what we first embarked to do – find a cure! I have since learned that the pink ribbon and Breast Cancer Awareness Month are both ingenious marketing ideas by companies wanting to further their cause. Although today it stands as a symbol of the stalwart and gallant women, and men, affected by this disease, full of stories that tug at your heart, it is a well designed strategy invented by companies looking for product promotion, better known as cause related marketing. The goal of finding a cure is somehow masked by this flurry of pink.I live in the real world. It is a hard blow to someone who is looking with child-like wonder at the pomp and circumstance, delighting in the participation. But after the last water bottle is picked up and the volunteers are gathered from the intersections, we still have a disease that is life-threatening. We are still burdened with a long-term illness that we’ll have to continue to provide for in terms of medical care and costs. That’s a lot of t-shirts on the shelf. They just remind me, day in and day out, that the game of Russian roulette with insurance, medical bills and rogue cancer cells is still on. Which one will get me first?This tends to get me thinking along the lines of prevention. It is time we dug out that relict saying, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” Wow. How much have we given to that cure?Is it not time we got back to basics and started looking for the prevention? I feel like we, as runners, the leaders of the pack in this evolution of marketing, can help round the corner on redirecting efforts, and not just for breast cancer, but for autism, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, birth defects, and let me go through the closest and all my t-shirts for more reasons.We can start simply by becoming aware of our environment? What is in our drinking water? What are we doing to our lawns and homes that affect our water sources? What chemicals have we become dependent on that are more for convenience? What are we exposing our children to for the perfect lawn? The perfect apple? The perfect home?Is it worth all this to prevent a weed? To prevent a bug? To prevent a germ?Hey, we as runners should say we want to prevent (insert disease or condition of your choice), and until you start to seriously consider this, we don’t want your t-shirt.After all, would it not be nice to pass me on a trail wearing a t-shirt that says, “Fun Run Just Because”?"},

Thank goodness for my alarm clock which shocks some sense into me. I wonder what it’s like to just wake up wanting to get out of bed? The rain had stopped by the time I left for work, so my commute was issue free. And frankly there’s a portion of my drive that I don’t remember at all. I was listening to my Mr. Pettigrew’s Last Stand & apparently I was quite caught up in it. Right now I’m watching the clouds fly by my window & remembering the scene from the second Mummy movie.

We spent the dayjust hanging out. Dr. M took a picture of a squirrel – I know! He never takespictures of squirrels…I finally unpacked a box ofbooks sent to me by The Cyber Hermit– woot! It’s her collection of Laurie R. King books about Sherlock Holmes &his wife Mary Russell. I’m VERY excited to get started on this series. Monday,January 16th – Martin Luther King Jr. Day I didn’t do a special post onthis day, but I’ll just repost what I said last year: …[we] celebratedthe life of a man who was a force for change in the world. A complicated man,and a dynamic one. He could have used that charisma for other pursuits, onesthat would most likely have not gotten him killed. But instead he took that burdenand raised it over his head & flung it out into the world to shatter at thefeet of complacent America. …whenwe allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and everyhamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that daywhen all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles,Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words ofthe old Negro spiritual, \"Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty,we are free at last!\" Martin Luther King, Jr.We decided to take a rambletoday. Is this a pony & a ram, or a pony & a footstool? A swan at a park in Springfield,looking at us kind of sideways.The secret purpose to our outingwas to use a gift card that Dr. M got for Christmas to get me a new point &shoot camera! As you can see, my old one (which I had had for quite some time)was having some issues. Although I think the purple rubber band adds somethingto its “look.” Here’s my new baby – it weighsabout 4 ounces less than the old one & will be living in my purse for allthose random State of the Bug pictures I like to take. Dr. M snuck Nutella into ourshopping cart on Saturday, so today I decided to try it for the first time ever. Well! Where have you been all my life? Tuesday,January 17thI was playing with my new cameraat work (since it was already in my purse & all). It’s the State of the Bug– sheepish! Not content to annoy my own selfwith my camera, I took it to my coworker’s office & bothered her. She was apretty good sport about it though. Heh.While I was playing around atwork Dr. M took a picture of a swollen Mad River – we’ve had lots of rainlately.Wednesday,January 18thDonkeys! They’re so cute &little.Yes, sheep on a hay roll. Thursday,January 19th We do our part to make sure that the squirrels in ourneighborhood are fat & sassy.Who’s that slipping over the fence? Friday,January 20th  Dr. M took this picture of deercrossing the railroad tracks – they love this area.The bird diner was in full swingtoday – all the tables were full & some patrons had to hover for a bitto find a seat.Mr. Cardinal looking haughty, asusual.Dr. M made a fabulous soup fordinner. Yes, that’s okra in there, as well as corn, peppers, onions, tomatoes, chicken sausage, and leftover green beans that alsohad some pecans in them. If you look closely you can see a pecan floating ontop! It made for an “interesting” contrast. Actually, I liked it a lot, but I’mnutty that way.Dr. M was fooling around withthe new camera.

This morning Dr. M & I went with Daddy & Amy to his nursing home ministry (leading hymns before Sunday School). Dr. M played some pre-singing dulcimer tunes, then I (sort of) played the piano while we all sang (including my aunt Mimi- loved hearing her & Amy sing alto). Then Dr. M & I headed back home for a bit before heading to his dad's house. We exchanged our gifts - I got a Radio Flyer wagon filled with Burt's Bees stuff! Dr. M, of course, got sheep & cow stuff :)I wish you all a fabulous Christmas!Go to Sara’s blog here to see the blogs of all the other Project365 participants.Most of our photos are taken with a 12 megapixel Nikon D5000 DSLR, usinga 55-200mm zoom lens.

I should have known I was in trouble when I noted that the store has giant tilted mirrors along the back wall so that the employees can keep an eye on customers. Nevertheless I was pleased no one was in my aisle, so I quickly placed the poem & took the pictures. Then I nonchalantly rounded the corner & two men in suits were heading toward me. “Can we help you find anything ma’am?” “No, I’m fine.” “Well, we like your hat.” The nerve!

Did that series use up all my words? Well, maybe, but that won’t stop me from using some now. Here are some bullet points:• Last night Dr. M & I looked out the door & saw snow! As my Facebook status said, these were my first flakes of the season (not counting my family from last week). Hardy har. I still get excited when I see snow – this emotion is left over from when I was a kid in North Carolina and snow seemed very rare. As long time readers of this blog know, I don’t actually like cold weather very much, and by February the excitement will have dimmed quite a bit. However, I have a new penguin toboggan that I can’t wait to wear (that’s what we call it where I’m from - do you call a knitted cap a toboggan?)• Speaking of regional differences, do you say that you are ON line at the grocery store or IN line? I say that I’m in line & I think it sounds really weird to say on line. But as I examine what the words mean I don’t really know that my way is better or worse – it’s just what I’m used to.• This year when my doctor called to say that they needed to take further pictures because they saw something on my mammogram I decided to not freak out like last year. I didn’t announce it on Facebook or my blog, telling only a handful of folks about it. And I really did seriously feel very calm. I went for the additional mammogram on Monday & they didn’t see anything at all. Apparently when they squinched me the first time it caused some sort of false lump. This time with the extra squinching (ow! ow! ow!) there was nothing there. That was a nice reward for my feeling of serenity.• I just saw someone walk by with three inch heels on. I looked down at them because she was walking kind of funny so I wanted to see her shoes. You know, it’s not sexy when you have to walk sort of pigeon toed because your shoes are too tall. Of course, I’m a fine one to talk – if I were to try to wear something like that I’d fall over, which I assure you is even more not sexy. Ha!Well, I’m going to just throw this on out there. You’ll probably see more drivel like this as I feel my way back toward blogging. P.S. If you look at my sidebar you can see what I’m reading.

I think youdid.In1980 I was in high school, and I was one of those unkissed boy crazy girls whogoes to the prom with a girlfriend. I was making plans for my life based on myexpected spinsterhood, and tormenting my mother with my superior knowledge oflanguage. I was churchy and bookish and a mostly A student who didn’t reallyapply herself very much. And while I thought Sandy was cute and all, I secretlywanted to be Rizzo.

You make the call!Anyway,I was your typical conflicted teenage nerd in 1980 with no idea what my lifewould look like in the future. I probably thought the idea of Xanadu wasmagical, sort of a forbidden heathen heaven. A nice place to escape. And whatteenager doesn’t want to escape a little bit?Whydoes Xanadu make me thankful? I look back at that girl and, while I’m gratefulfor her, I’m so thankful to not beher anymore! She envisioned a different life than the one I have now. Her ideaof heaven wasn’t the same as mine. I wonder what she would have thought if shehad looked down that long road and seen me at the end of it? She might havebeen horrified, but I know Xanadu when I see it."},

I’m only sharing a few here including this teaser:Go to his blog to get the rest.Really – you don’t want to miss all the sheep pictures.

{"title": "Vend", "date": "Thursday, November 17, 2011", "text": "Well, what do you know – another word on my ABCs of Gratitude list that makes no sense. I’m pretty sure that I was just writing down words that began with the appropriate letter instead of considering what they really meant. However, I will work with what my brain spewed out instead of cheating & choosing a nice word like “Vast” or “Vicissitude.” Let’s see how I do.One of the definitions of Vend is: To offer (an idea, for example) for public consideration. Well now, I can work with that! For what is this blog, but a place to offer my fabulous mediocre interesting ideas to you, the public?I started the blog because I was reading & commenting on other blogs & felt like I should offer those folks a place to say hello back. I had an additional goal of working on my writing skills and perhaps beginning to write poetry more regularly again. And I wanted to entertain, in a forum that felt safer to me than face to face interaction. I think I’ve met those goals pretty well over the couple of years I’ve been writing here. I was going to be all self deprecating, but I’ll just say that I enjoy writing here & I feel like I’ve written some good poetry (sometimes – other times I hold my nose while reading it). But what I didn’t expect was the feeling of family. You come here to read & I go to your place to read & we get to know each other so that I almost feel like I could go & stay at your house if I were in your neck of the woods. (For the record, I like a nice fat pillow & lots of blankets). People who don’t have cyber friends don’t really get it – but at least in the places where we intersect here on the interwebs, I feel like we’re family. I want to know how your day is going and whether you got the job/award/new shoes. And you guys do a good job of acting like you want to know about my life too. It’s all very affirming. And I’m grateful for the opportunity to vend my mental wares and browse through yours. Hmm – that sounded dirtier than I meant it!"},

{"title": "Try", "date": "Tuesday, November 15, 2011", "text": "Today’s gratitude word is “try.” And when I wrote the word down in September I’m sure I had some noble purpose in mind (not really). But I’m going to do something slightly different today because I am bursting with miscellanea that has nowhere to go but right here. So instead of the noble idea (that doesn't really exist), I’m going to share recent things I’ve witnessed that illustrate the power of working hard for your goal.·         There’s this one. I admit I was a little grossed out by the idea of piecing together partially digested money. But what an intrepid couple! And they’ve learned a valuable lesson about leaving things where their dog might get them.·         On Monday as I was driving to work I glanced at the car in front of me & saw a MOUSE running along its back bumper! The car started moving & the mouse went back into the trunk. Later, as I was trying to figure out how to tell the lady she had a mouse in her car (& whether that would even be a good idea in morning rush hour traffic), I saw the mouse on the bumper again, poised to jump off the car as it stopped. I didn’t get to see the leap, but I choose to believe that the mouse made it safely into the grass by the side of the road. Can you imagine how it was feeling? It was so cute & brave… OK, I know it probably wasn’t really brave, but I choose to believe that it was.·         The other day I was trying to sing in the car. I came to a sad realization. Listen to this “playlist” – I sang: Come Ye Sinners, Amazing Grace, America the Beautiful, the Star Spangled Banner (badly – it’s kind of hard to sing that one sitting down), and Be Thou My Vision. Do I have anything other than religious or patriotic songs in my repertoire? Well, I do have ONE other song that I can sing from memory, but the chorus goes, “Hey mister, take a chance, it only costs you a dime a dance, and if you’re looking for romance, I’ll be nice to you. Hey mister, it's so cold when you don't have anyone to hold - I'll do anything I'm told to do... Baby, I want you.” I’ve mentioned it on the blog before – it was on the flip side of Vicki Lawrence’s The Night the Lights Went out in Georgia. I was nine when it came out & I used to sing Dime a Dance all the time. Thank goodness there were no “Misters” out there taking me up on my offer. Anyway, the point here is that I’m trying to sing some every day. Reya says it’s good for you – it makes your voice stronger, and it’s fun. I just need to learn some new tunes.·         One last thing. I’m trying a really simple version of yoga these days. Our rector’s husband is an instructor so he’s offered to give classes once a week. I remember back in the day I could sit on the floor & cross my legs with no problem (criss-cross applesauce). It’s been such a long time since I even tried – it feels good to realize my limitations and try to push past them a little bit each week.So, what new thing are you trying to do lately? Saving money (literally), taking a leap of faith, learning new things, stretching? Do tell!"},
{"title": "Storm", "date": "Monday, November 14, 2011", "text": "As I think about what “storm” means I keep hearing Stevie Nicks in my head. “I have always been a storm,” she says. And I do believe that she was speaking truth in that song – she has always been a storm. Well, as I once said about myself in a poem, “I am not a storm or an ocean or even a calm sky. I am a catfish pond, murky and sustaining. And that’s all you really need to know.”What does that even mean? And what does it have to do with gratitude? Here’s what I think.While I’m predisposed to be dramatic in the telling of events, my life really isn’t all that dramatic. And I like it that way – only stirring gentle winds every now & then to keep things interesting. (From Dr. M’s perspective these winds might not actually be that gentle, but that’s his tale to tell). But that doesn’t mean that storms haven’t come our way. We’ve had the heartbreak of losing our mothers. The disappointment of jobs that fell through. The real life storm that blew the roof off of our townhouse in 1997.Common wisdom states that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Well, I don’t really know how true that is. It certainly rips off those rose colored glasses that we try to cling to. But I do know this: going through a storm is one of the best ways to know how strong your community is. God, friends, family – all right there with the wind and the rain. It’s pretty powerful.I’m not really thankful for the storm. But I am for the hands that held mine and kept me from being swept away in it."},
{"title": "Rust", "date": "Sunday, November 13, 2011", "text": "Tess at Willow Manor likes to talk about patina. It is defined thusly:1. A thin greenish layer, usually basic copper sulfate, that forms on copper or copper alloys, such as bronze, as a result of corrosion. 2. The sheen on any surface, produced by age and use. 3. A change in appearance produced by long-standing behavior, practice, or use: a face etched with a patina of fine lines and tiny wrinkles. I suppose that, in the normal scheme of things, patina is to be preferred over rust. But rust is the word I chose for the letter R in my ABCs of gratitude and now I have to figure out why that is. I could have meant the color of the leaves on the trees I can see outside my window. Or perhaps a soft skirt I once owned in that same color. But I think I was feeling thankful for the absence of rust. Specifically that rasping that accompanied the movement of my left hip. It’s gone now. I’m still in terrible shape – I don’t exercise enough & the area around that hip needs strengthening, but I can crawl around on the floor if I want to. And I can stand for hours and minutes at a time without hip pain. And I can sleep on that side when I go to bed.So instead of feeling rusty and ready for the nursing home, I consider myself to have a fine patina, a sheen well suited to my age.You probably didn't know this, but I really like my husband a lot. Heh. Seems like a lot of the poetry I write is been about him. He's not perfect, but my goodness neither am I! I think we do pretty darn well with our imperfections.So,to my favorite historian. Love you, dear heart."},

{"title": "Quiet", "date": "Thursday, November 10, 2011", "text": "I’ve been getting off track a bit in the last spate of posts. This is supposed to be ABCs of GRATITUDE after all. What was I thankful for about “Plan” – could you tell? I’m not sure what my point was. I guess I’m grateful that I’m able to choose to plan or not. Heh.Anyway, it’s easy to be thankful for “quiet.” I do listen to audio books in the car, but otherwise, left to my own devices, my world is really quiet. When Dr. M isn’t home I don’t turn on the TV or music (unless it’s baseball season). At work my office is remarkably quiet – people comment on it as if it’s a bad thing. But I have all these words in my head (Not voices! Really. Really!) and as Dr. M can tell you I’m easily distracted. It’s so nice to just be able to focus on my work or writing or what I’m reading. Especially at work, because that leaves me a little more able to interact with Dr. M when I get home. So, today I’m thankful for my quiet office and the opportunity to work without distraction.P.S. The best part about doing this series is picking out a different font for each letter. I love doing that!

I’d love to believe in karma – that the bad things people do will come back to bite them & that the good things people do will be rewarded. And I do believe that our actions have consequences. But bad things happen to good people. It’s not just a saying – it’s the truth. I don’t believe that their behavior in past lives is giving them grief now, and I don’t believe that God is punishing them in some way. Things happen. It’s up to us to live up to our own ideals (for me those would be the WWJD* ideals) and forge a path through life that leads to as few regrets as possible. When I put karma on the gratitude list I think what I had in mind is that I’m really grateful for the life that I lead. I was given the opportunity to go to college. I’ve never had to go hungry (quite the opposite, in fact!). I’ve always had access to clean water and good health care. I married my soul mate (almost 21 years ago!). I am deeply aware of how blessed I am. And I know that things could change at any moment. For today, let’s just savor what’s good in our lives.

Seriously, I was truly in some sort of trance when I wrote these words down. What could insulation possibly have to do with gratitude? Well, considering my substantial back side perhaps my subconscious was referring to my natural insulation. Or maybe it was thinking of the way that I can turn off the world when I’m reading a good book. Or…I have a terrible memory. If you’ve offended me I’m not likely to remember why for very long & I’ll even forget that I’m supposed to be mad at you after a while. In fact, I feel certain that I’ve already shared this trait (more than once), but I don’t remember. And isn’t it nice to live in this nice cushioned room with unremembered grievances? I’m shielded from the distress of being hurt whenever I think about them. Because I don’t think about them.Now this isn’t to say that I don’t have a list of things that go in Dr. M’s minus column*, but they’re amorphous. If I were asked to give a concrete example of an offense I would probably not be able to be that specific. In fact, I’m sitting here trying to even come up with a category (snoring? Falling asleep during a documentary now that I’m hooked on it so I have to stay up to watch it?) – I don’t really have anything. I’m not very good at keeping score. And that’s where this turns into gratitude. Who needs to keep score anyway? Why can’t every day be a fresh start with a person, full of the possibility of lovingkindness? Forget yesterday – I certainly do. And I’ll just go ahead & issue a blanket apology right now to folks I may have offended – because you know I’m not going to remember doing it anyway!*Dr. M’s pluses so vastly outweigh the minuses that I’m even embarrassed to use him as an example.

Why, just today I had two separate rants about the downfall of the written word. You know, I am not perfect. I make typos and errors in grammar & word usage all the time. I reread things I’ve written & just scratch my head. But…One of my favorite comic strips used this phrase: “You complain…more often THEN anyone I have ever known.” [emphasis added] Gah!And then I saw this gem from the (self-published) book I’m currently reading: “The shirt was almost completely soaked with blood. He crawled into the front and leaned over the back of the seat to work on her leg. He untied it and tossed it outside on the ground.”Gah again! Really? Why is he flinging her leg around? I’m enjoying the plot and the characters, but the book is filled with little gems like this (as well as misplaced or missing commas and the incorrect forms of words). The author needed a much better editor.And how could we forget this? Sigh.As I wrote the previous paragraphs I began to grasp why “editor” is something that makes me happy. I love it! I love finding typos and correcting things in my head. It’s like working a puzzle of some kind. Sure I enjoy reading books that don’t require my nit-picky brain, but I like the so-so ones where I can indulge my inner Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis too. I think I need to wear a little pillbox hat when I read those books. Ha![Edited because I put \"wear those books\" at the end instead of \"read\" - that made me laugh given the subject matter. Head.

They inspired me to get up earlier – until the next morning. Just five more minutes please…But it’s there, you know? The dawn, I mean. Every morning I know that dawn has arrived whether I greeted it or not. Sometimes I am humbled and amazed at this world of ours. On those days I make sure to use a real spoon for my yogurt instead of a plastic one. Because one less plastic spoon might someday make a difference in the dawn."},

Mostly because I either a) speak before I think, or b) can’t figure out why what I say shouldn’t be (brutally) truthful. Not surprisingly, this has led people to shake their heads or fists at me on a regular basis. Actually, I should qualify that by saying that I’m candid when I feel comfortable in a situation. So if I’m speaking my mind – congratulations! You have set me at ease. Next time you’ll be more standoffish won’t you?I’m sitting here trying to figure out why I put this word on a gratitude list – what about “candid” makes me thankful? Especially because being candid can be hurtful if I’m not careful.I think that being candid frees me to not try to figure out who I’m going to be.

{"title": "Antidisestablishmentarianism", "date": "Wednesday, October 19, 2011", "text": "So I’m going to try to do the ABC’s of gratitude this year.I sat down sometime in September and wrote 26 words to use. They just poppedinto my head & I typed them on the page. Perhaps someone will want to usethese words as a psychology project to study the inside of my head. Butprobably not. They’re so random I’m pretty sure there’s no deep meaning. It’sgoing to be fun to come up with a coherent thought about what the word has todo with thanksgiving. Without further ado, here’s the first one.AntidisestablishmentarianismWhen I was a child I was pretty shy. I didn’t like talking to strangers orbeing in new situations. However, with my family it was a whole ‘nother matter.If a situation didn’t have two sides to it I made one up just so I could arguethe opposite side. My freshman (or was it sophomore?) year in high school Isigned up for journalism as my elective. But my uncle Johnny, who taughtEnglish in my school, convinced me to switch to the debate class because Iseemed so well-suited to it. Heh. So I did. And while I decided that my mind wasn’tquick and flexible enough to debate I learned to write and give speeches. Instrange places. In front of strange people. I wasn’t super duper fabulous, butin the same way that piano lessons taught me the valuable life skill of readingmusic, original oratory taught me how to walk into a room and not feel likeshrinking up against the wall. I might go so far as to say that taking thatclass taught me how to go to college by myself with no friends, and to go to Zambia bymyself (that’s kind of a long plane ride from NC, in case you wondered). And I learned to sayantidisestablishmentarianism really fast. Saying tongue twisters was the bestpart of the class. Really!So my first ABC of gratitude is a big Thank You to my UncleJohnny for getting me prepared to live in the world with other human beings andactually talk to them."},

I’m self-diagnosing here, but I’m pretty sure that’s what’s going on. And let me tell you that sucker hurts! And do you have any idea how often even a computer potato like me uses that muscle? I’m on a strict regimen of ice & heat & slacktitude. I’ll report on Thursday about whether or not it’s working. What I really need are some drugs, but I don’t think I’ve ever even taken a muscle relaxer & I definitely don’t have any in our medicine cabinet.• Baseball is now dead to me. At least until March when pitchers & catchers report. I know people who are pulling for the Cardinals and people who are pulling for the Rangers. And I wish them all well.

{"title": "If You Tarry...", "date": "Tuesday, October 4, 2011", "text": "I really really need to get some new clothes for fall. My sweaters are pilled and everything looks like it’s been washed a thousand times. There are two reasons I haven’t wanted to mess with it. The first reason is that I hate loathe despise dislike shopping. But the second reason might be even more of a factor. I don’t want to buy new things until my body is in better shape. Why waste money on clothes that I might only wear for a little while?There are a couple of problems with that logic. First of all, on my body it takes about 20 pounds before I go down a size. Do we realistically think I’ll lose 20 pounds this fall? My magic eightball says: Very Doubtful.The second problem is illustrated in this way. Last night I got up to go to the bathroom as per usual. When I came back to bed I realized that I had a hymn playing in my head. My favorite verse of that hymn is: Come ye weary, heavy laden, lost and ruined by the fall – if you tarry till you’re better, you will never come at all.It’s talking about not waiting to come to Jesus until you’re perfect & have fixed all your problems. But I think it applies to other things as well. Don’t wait to live your life until you’ve lost the weight/got the job/read the manual/washed the car. Go ahead & live it now. And maybe while you’re at it buy a new blouse for heaven’s sake. Or not, because that first reason for not buying new clothes (I hate loathe despise dislike shopping) still applies."},

I love it whensomeone comments on a comment I make on their post. I don’t expect it, always,but I think it’s fun when there’s a conversation going on in the comments. So,I’m going to experiment with inserting my thoughts in the comments from time totime. I’m letting you know because if you’re like me you don’t always go backto read other people’s comments if you know there won’t be a conversation. Whohas the time? We’ll see how it goes.Also, we often get questionsabout what type of camera we have. We use two. I’m going to put the specs onthose two cameras at the bottom of each P365 post so you’ll be able to findthem if you’re interested.Sunday,September 18th   The geraniums are still goingstrong. Love this shot that Dr. M took of a bee. Squirrel in motion! Dr. M wastaking a picture of the squirrel at the bottom of the picture (burrowing hisnose into the ground) & got a bonus leaping squirrel. Fun!Monday,September 19thWe’re going to have to move thisfeeder somewhere else. The squirrels just ate practically the whole block inone day. But watching their acrobatics is pretty darn entertaining.Tomato Ripening Station in therain. We’re hoping we get enough sun to ripen these outside. Otherwise it’swrapped in newspaper & put into a dark box for these guys.Tuesday,September 20th  I snuck & took this pictureof Dr. M & our neighbor K talking over the fence. Wednesday,September 21stDr. M took some pictures on hisway home from school. Here are some cows.I never get tired of the goldensoybean fields.Horses. You notice how theanimals all stare at Dr. M? “It’s that man with a camera again. Is he a spy?”Thursday,September 22nd        Happy birthday Amy! Hope Daddy took you out somewherespecial today. Meanwhile, I tried to do this.But my iron was one point too low. The State of the Bug - iron deficient (just a little bit).

I think I will probably dust at some point, but otherwise it’s beennice to just hang out & get more familiar with the new Facebook changes.This is one of the things we’re doing - watching baseball. Our Braves are really killing us – so closeto clinching the wild card & yet they keep losing games. I love that we canhook Dr. M’s computer up to the TV & watch the games (sadly, Ohio is notconsidered the south so we can’t get the games on Fox Sports South – imaginethat!) – MLB TV has totally been worth the expense for us this year!Go to Sara’s blog here to see the blogs ofall the other Project 365 participants. Have a great week!Most of our photos are taken with a 12megapixel Nikon D5000 DSLR, using a 55-200mm zoom lens. This is the camera thatDr. M takes with him most days. We also take pictures with our old reliable 7megapixel Canon Powershot A710. This is the camera that the Bug uses most of thetime.

I’m pretty thankful for her & her presence in my dad’s life. Happy Birthday Amy!I’m so thankful for all the responses to my post about grief. You guys had some great stuff to say – thanks!I took a walk around the block last night! I was really wiped out afterward, but I didn’t have any trouble doing it. I even walked for a few yards without my cane. I’m pretty excited. I hope to do this every evening I can. Of course, in the not too distant future it will be dark before I get home, but hey I could take a flashlight! And since we’re planning a trip to Chicago in January (history conference – woot!) & will be doing a lot of walking there, I want to do some winter weather walking anyway to get myself ready. Snow sprints here I come! Maybe not – that might create a “knotted plow line” scenario with Dr. M.This one is a mixed thanksgiving. I tried to give blood today but was refused because my iron isn’t high enough – by one measly point. I wasn’t totally surprised because I’ve been eating a lot of ice lately, but one point low isn’t too bad. So I’m thankful that my iron isn’t so low that I’ll fall over any time soon (except for my general klutziness – I’ll fall over from that I’m sure), but sad that I couldn’t give blood. I took my camera after all so I could get a State of the Bug picture. Now we’ll have a whole different kind of State of the Bug. I’m taking the day off tomorrow just because. Though I’ve already scheduled a full day’s worth of work to do at home. My goal is to have no chores remaining for Saturday or Sunday. So, what are you thankful for today?"},
{"title": "Diamonds Outweigh the Grief", "date": "Tuesday, September 20, 2011", "text": "I had trouble falling asleep last night. It took as many as twenty minutes for me to reach oblivion. A long time for me. I had an image that kept flashing through my head. I tried brushing it aside with visions of sugarplums, but it was a persistent bugger. It was that time in the hospital when we had decided to take Mom off the cancer study (because it seemed to be killing her faster than the cancer) and we had Hospice come in to talk her about using their services at home. I was the only family member in the room and she turned to me in a panic. “That sounds like you think I’m dying! Do you think I’m dying?” Only every time I look at you mom.That’s not what I said. I didn’t answer her question – I just said that we thought she’d be a lot more comfortable at home and that Hospice could help with that. And she was a lot more comfortable for the next three months. I’ve replayed that scene in my head a million times since then. I think I gave the right answer. She didn’t want to think about death. She never did. When she gave me her diamond earrings the last time I saw her she said, “it’s just that they’re too big for my head now.” It’s been 6 years, 183 days since she breathed her last. I would have thought that the random huge grief would lessen with time. I guess not yet. Not yet.And I have to admit that losing a mother is just about the most enormous thing a person faces – bigger even than diamond earrings.I’m thinking today of people who’ve lost their mothers recently, especially Dr. M, Chris, Rachel and Rebecca. Hoping the diamonds outweigh the grief most of the time."},

The Castles are participating in the events being held aspart of Ohio’s Civil War 150 commemoration. Today there were talks about medicine in theCivil War (I skipped that one), Ohio women in the Civil War (excellent), and apoet connected with the Castles who lived during the Civil War (Sarah Piatt –again an excellent talk).

Actually though, I’m having a pretty good Monday. I just have the song in my head & thought I would share. You’re welcome. So, on to the miscellany!It feels like I’m posting a LOT these days. Does it seem that way to you? Do you look at your blog reader & think, “Will she ever just SHUT UP?” Humph. Well maybe I’ll take tomorrow off. We’ll see.I was commenting on another blog last week about how I don’t care if the toothpaste tube is squeezed from the middle or bottom, just as long as we squeeze every last drop out of it. But I remember a day in the distant past when it was very important to me that the toothpaste be squeezed from the bottom. Huge deal. Although I didn’t care what Dr. M did – I just spent extra time every evening making sure it was the way I liked it. I was trying to remember when I stopped caring & I think it was when I started flossing regularly. Who has time to police the toothpaste when you have to spend all these extra minutes or seconds flossing? I kept losing my cane this weekend. I would be in the bedroom looking around & realize I’d left it in the bathroom. I don’t want to totally abandon it just yet because I kind of walk like a duck without it & I don’t want to learn any bad walking habits. But soon. Soon.And speaking of my recent surgery (I know, I think I promised last week to quit yapping about it), I’ve lost my most reliable excuse for getting out of work. “You know, I would help with the pancake breakfast, but I’m just not able to be on my feet that long.” “I would vacuum out my car, but it’s just impossible, what with the hip pain.” “I would take a walk around the neighborhood, but I’m just afraid I couldn’t make it around the block.” Well, little missy, what are you going to say now? Admit your abiding laziness, or just woman up & do things? Hmmm?I went to the café at work this morning fully intending to get a 1000 calorie muffin, or some chocolate covered almonds. Or maybe a honey bun. I walked out with a banana and fat free yogurt. Wha??? I would just like to say welcome to the alien in my head, can you stay awhile please?Okay. Done now."},
{"title": "Poetry Jam - the One about the Drugs...", "date": "Sunday, September 11, 2011", "text": "Lilu over at Poetry Jam has challenged us to write about prescription drugs. I've written perhaps the worst poem I've ever written - no really, it's fairly horrid. I wish I could blame some prescription drugs, but as you can see at the end that isn't the case. Go here to read what will probably be some excellent poetry on the subject.I'd like to apologize for the poem on another level. I know that there are a lot of people for whom prescription drugs are a real problem. And I always assumed that if I was ever given access to the right narcotic it would be a problem for me too.Farewell Little PillI don’t drink or smoke dopein case that would be the ropeto hang myself in addiction.But my recent hospital stayfound me eager to sayplease wipe away this affliction.I welcomed the narcotic.Its effects were quite cathartic.My pain was drowned in sweet relief.But I was fairly bemusedand (when awake) was confusedby the appeal of this stuff on the street.It eased the pain in my hipand when the pain was gone I quit.The End.In an oxycontin haze...OnMonday September 10th, 2001 I was knee deep in red tape. The real red tape that was wrapped aroundletters from Freedman’s Bureau agents in Kentucky to their superiors. I washelping Dr. M with his dissertation research in the National Archives inWashington, DC. Our strategy was to flag all of the interesting documents andthen come back the next day to make copies. The stories I read made me want toweep – these agents used the word “outrages” to describe what was happening toformer slaves in post Civil War Kentucky. These stories became the backbone of whatI consider to be a pretty powerful work about the plight of freed people inKentucky.Tuesdaymorning, September 11th, as we prepared to leave our Maryland extended stay to spend the daymaking copies, we didn’t turn on the television. In the car on the way to thenearest Red Line metro station we listened to a music CD. And as we grew evermore frustrated with traffic and full metro parking lots, we just thought itwas a part of the mania of Washington DC at rush hour. Finally, we gave uptrying to get on the Red Line and decided just to drive down the Potomac andmaybe stop at the Iwo Jima Memorial to take in the view. After that, we hoped to get parked at aVirginia metro station. We weren’t in aparticular hurry, as the Archives stays open late on Tuesdays. However, I was feeling rather desperate to go, so we pulled off into a park where Icould use the facilities.Isprinted off & did my thing. Walking back to the car I saw a curious sight.Dr. M was sitting in one of our folding chairs watching one of the park rangersgo through our car trunk. Let me just be a little politically incorrect here:as a college educated white couple with ordinary hair, no visible tattoos orstrange piercings and respectable (if off the rack) clothing, we were notgenerally a target for random searches. This was a thorough search. Iasked Dr. M what was going on & he just shrugged. I asked the park ranger& he said that he couldn’t really tell me but that I should listen to theradio. “Listen to the radio!!” So after he finished with the trunk, and whileDr. M had his turn with the facilities, I got in the car and turned on theradio. And listened.Wedidn’t go back to the National Archives that day. We checked out of our hoteland headed home. Not home to Ohio, but home to North Carolina to be with ourfamilies. I think we may have been in shock, a bit, but we were aware enough tonotice the eerie silent skies above us. Inthe last ten years I’ve run the gamut of emotions: patriotic fervor, worry& dread, horror at how innocent people were treated. I applauded war andabhorred war. I wanted retribution and I cringed from the actions ofretribution. Deep down at my core I just want everyone to get along. Can’t weall just get along? Sigh. I guess not, and that makes me sad. I know, it’s notthat simple, but that doesn’t keep me from wishing it was.Soin the end I’m left with feeling sad as I hold my little flag and listen to GodBless America during one more 7th inning stretch. How about, Godbless us, every one? No?This past week Dr. M met with theparents of Alicia Nicole Titus, who was a flight attendant on the jet that wasflown into the South Tower. They have established a fund in her name whichhonors her life by promoting a culture of peace.

You’ve been warned!First of all, however, is something that’s totally heartfelt & not a whine. Do you believe in the power of prayer? I’ve often felt impotent as I prayed, although I just as often felt a deep sense of peace afterward. But I haven’t really thought of myself as an object of prayer & in fact the portion of my evening prayers where I ask God to help me is the most brief. It just feels wrong somehow. But I believe that my peace of mind going into surgery, the success of that surgery & the ease (so far) of my recovery are totally due to all the prayers that friends & family, and even some of you, offered up on my behalf. So thank you. And thank God!Speaking of that recovery, I went online to determine when it might be ok to ditch the cane and read where one surgeon was excited that his patients were cane-free after four months. Four months! Today marks the one month anniversary of my surgery & I was thinking about ditching my cane next week! So, here’s my backhanded thankfulness: I’m glad that I have permission to not rush my recovery. Maybe I’ll dial it down a notch. And speaking of canes, I’m thankful that today walking into work it was only misty & not raining. I can’t figure out how to manage a cane & an umbrella, so yesterday I got soaked walking out to my car in the steady rain. Also, free tip: don’t put lotion on your hands & then walk in the rain with a cane. It was kind of slippery. And to end on a truly thankful note, I’m thankful that the 2nd ultrasound (which I had before my surgery) only turned up something small & not worth messing with & that otherwise everything is just fine in there. So, no kidney or uterus problems for me. I plan to not have any other tests or issues for at least another year. It’s Dr. M’s turn to give our health insurance a run for its money!OK, that’s enough for now. What are you thankful for today?P.S. Maybe next week I’ll talk about something other than my health!"},

As usual, we came home with dozens of pictures of birds.They make us laugh & then just astound us with their beauty. I know thatsome folks don’t like seagulls, but since I don’t live around them I’ll justadmire how pretty they are.An egret...Of course it wouldn't be a lake trip without pictures of black ducks.There are always a few dogs. This one was really eager to get to the water for a drink.And this one played fetch forever - bounding out for the ball & then practically just floating back with it.On the first day we were there it was fairly warm (I only got a little chilled). We saw flowers & butterflies.But Monday a cold front moved through & it was really really windy and quite chilly. Thank goodness Dr. M packed a long sleeved shirt for me (he always does). And even though it was cold & blustery I really loved the atmospheric sky.We had such a nice time.

We had a great time & I’m gonna tell you all about it. You have tolook at my vacation pictures! Well, I guess technically you don’t have to, butI’m posting them anyway. And I’m going to do it two installments because it wasjust that much fun. Ha!So the first thing that happened was that we drove throughYellow Springs, OH (because you kind of have to) & witnessed their weekly “MakePeace Not War” demonstration. There were a few more people than this, but Ilike the flag.We decided to stay in a bargain hotel for a change andactually enjoyed it – even though I missed some of the perks of a Comfort Innlevel chain. Like a clock in the room and a little lotion in the bathroom. Butthe beds were pretty comfortable and the rates were reasonable. I loved thissign on the door to the laundry room. And then there was this. Here’s the view outside one of our windows.And this is what was happening under that tent. Yes, we stumbled onto The Perch, Peach, Pierogi & Polka festival. The good news is thatwe didn’t have to pay to get in to hear the band. The bad news is that we heard“Roll out the Barrel” at least four times. The other good news is that I cantestify that the pierogies & peach cobbler were fantastic. Here’s the backdeck of our hotel where we ate our bounty last night.The other bad news is that they played until 10:00 eachnight. On the other hand it wasn’t all old polka standards. Last night I heardthose great new polka songs, “The Electric Slide” and “Play that Funky MusicWhite Boy.” If you think we were annoyed, think again. We were highly amused and mostly enjoyed themusic. And watching all the folks (most of them with snow white hair) dancing aroundthe dance floor. My one regret is that I didn't get a picture of Dr. M dancing around the hotel room. Although he might have been doing a waltz instead of a polka. Heh.Tomorrow I’ll write about our actual lake experience.Warning: there will be a lot of pictures in that post!"},

While I’ve\rbeen mired in my own recovery & sussing out each individual pain to\rdetermine if it’s “normal” or not (according to the interwebs, it is normal), Dr. M has been suffering\rwith the northeast as they reel from Hurricane Irene.

It's like Christmas! Heh. I wonder if I'll think it's like Christmas at 6:00 a.m. when the alarm goes off? Ah well, I decided to go ahead & write my Monday Miscellany post instead of reading (I'm currently reading another serial killer novel - NOT good middle-of-the-night fare).\r\r\rThe other night I dreamed that I was covering for a librarian on her lunch break. While she was gone my main responsibility was to find a quiet place for a young lady to work out a math theorem as part of an entrance exam for school. We looked everywhere & that was one loud & busy library! Music, dancing, talking, everywhere. After I finally found a good spot for her I asked what the theorem was (like I would even understand it). It was to solve this equation: 1,000,000 pine trees divided by 100 squirrels = X. Really? I know I'm taking pain meds, but that is a pretty bizarre equation. I blame Over the Hedge. \rThis is going to be TMI (sorry Dr. M) but I find myself thanking God (really!) for a bodily function that used to be pretty regular before my surgery. Now it's kind of hit or miss, and I am very appreciative when things work correctly.  \rSpeaking of prayer, the neighbor boy next door told Dr. M tonight that he's having an biopsy of his liver tomorrow. Please keep Austin &  his family in your prayers because that sounds pretty scary to us.\rTonight as I lay in bed trying to fall asleep I was filled with this immense feeling of well-being, of all being right in the world, that I am being watched over, and that life is great. I'm so very thankful for that feeling, even if it might be what's causing me to stay awake!\r\r\r\r\rWell, I'm going to get off of here & try to get some sleep.

{"title": "Thankful Thursday", "date": "Thursday, August 25, 2011", "text": "Obviously, I have a lot to be thankful for today. And I'm going to get to that in a minute. But first I'm going to whine just a wee bit (you have to admit I've hardly whined at all in weeks, so I'm due!). Yesterday I had a great day with Daddy & Amy, which I will describe below. But during to a visit to a restroom I finally realized the importance of paying attention to those yellow \"caution the floor is wet\" dealios. Did you know that the rubber bottom of a cane just slides right along on a wet tile floor? It was almost an oopsie-daisy situation, but I caught myself in time. BUT this morning my right shoulder hurts a LOT. Ouch ouch ouch! On the other hand my hip is just fine. So my maneuver to save it worked yesterday. [Note: for those of you concerned about the fact that this is the shoulder I had surgery on two years ago, do not fear - the sore part is in the (supposed) muscle, not in the joint. I say supposed, because, really, I guess it's technically a muscle, but have you seen my arms?]\r\rOK, now, let's be thankful. I'm so glad that Daddy & Amy came up to visit. We've had a nice time together, and really that's what this post is going to be all about. Tuesday night we went out for Mexican food. Aren't they cute?\r\r\r\r\rYesterday, I took them on a mini tour of the area. First of all we went to Dr. M's campus. We saw the Bugly, but decided not to bother him since he was working. Instead we went to a museum on the campus. It was fun showing them around up there.\r\rThen we stopped at Young's Jersey Dairy for lunch & ice cream. There was a meeting of the Red Hat Society there!\r\r\r\r\rI love their TV setup.\r\r\r\r\rWe ate lunch inside, but decided to head outside to eat our ice cream. I love how the goats jump up on things to get people's attention. These are the most spoiled goats ever - they get lots of attention.\r\r\r\r\rHere I am in a post ice cream stupor. And I was sensible - I just had one scoop. Amy ate an entire sundae all on her own - even though Daddy eyed it a couple of times.\r\r\r\r\rDaddy & Amy had to explore the barn to check out all the Jersey girls. Here they are on the way back.\r\r\r\r\rAfter Young's we decided to check out Clifton Mill. I sat on a bench while Daddy & Amy explored the water wheel and covered bridge. Here I am all pleased with myself for doing my sitting physical therapy exercises while I waited on them.\r\r\r\rHas my face shrunk, or are these sunglasses extra huge today?\r\rHere they are on the way back - I love how they're always holding hands.\r\r\r\r\rThen we all came home and took a nap, after which we had a nice dinner. I fixed asparagus & potatoes, and Dr. M heated up the meatloaf we were given. And chopped a tomato. And cleaned off & set the table. And got our drinks. Hmm. I think my part of the meal was pretty puny in retrospect.\r\rSo, I'm thankful for a great day. For family and friends. For Dr. M (a thousandfold). For healing. And for all of you guys who read this stuff!\r\rWhat are you thankful for?"},

I'll have home health care come in for two weeks to do blood draws (because I'm on coumadin to thin my blood) & help with physical therapy. The PT in the hospital wasn't bad at all - I think I'll ace this recuperation. As I said to Dr. M today, I don't know why I couldn't just go ahead & go back to work now. There's the little issue of not being cleared to drive yet, but otherwise I think it would be a breeze to go back to work. Heh. Daddy & Amy are coming to visit & help out on the 22nd so I'll be taking my full three weeks off no matter what I think about the situation.\r\rDr. M has just been the BEST. He worked hard to get the house ready for me & a walker. We were a little concerned about me and this potential weapon, but he did such a good job so no worries here. While he was out getting my prescriptions filled I snuck* and took a couple of pictures. The first one is showing how he fixed the kitchen so I could actually go between the table & the refrigerator. The second one is me at the wheel, so to speak - aren't I always taking pictures while I'm on the go? As you can see, life is good right now.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rSo, what are you thankful for today?\r\r* I don't think I knew until just now that snuck wasn't a real word.

Should I risk going now, or wait?Man, my nails are a mess.I wish I had brought a book to read. There aren't even any interesting disease pamphlets in here.I wonder if I would get in trouble if I tried the reflex hammer on myself?

So I’m going to enthrall you with my medical issues. You should probably stop reading this right now & save it for some night when you can’t get to sleep.Because of my doctor’s concerns with my recent blood tests I had to provide a 24 hour urine sample to the lab this morning. Do you know what that is? I didn’t. Now I know that it’s a plot to make you become very familiar with your own output. I suppose mothers might not be fazed, but it was a duty that I bore quite grimly. Toting my little jug to the bathroom at work yesterday, storing the contents in the refrigerator, doing the same routine at home & during my two nocturnal bathroom visits – I do NOT want to have to do that again. I’ve always maintained that I have to go to the bathroom so often because my bladder is the size of a pea (heh), but based on how heavy that jug was this morning I must just produce a lot. Today, I have the pleasure of drinking 20 oz of water between 11:00 and 12:00 & then going for an ultrasound at 1:00. And not going to the bathroom during that time. I don’t know how long the ultrasound takes, but that’s going to be a long two hours for me. Aren’t you glad you came to my blog today to hear about my bathroom habits? P.S.

Being a drama queen I didn’t go to church just in case Iwas too pitiful. But really it wasn’t that bad. I wouldn’t want to have to walktoo far, but I think I could have occupied a pew. ·        This week I’ll have some testing done to explain a fewunexpected results on my blood test – checking out my kidneys. Of course I ranstraight to the internet for a diagnosis & decided that my prolonged use ofibuprofen has caused me to have Stage 1 kidney disease. [Note prior mention of “drama queen.”] Of course I’ll keep you guysposted.·        We had dinner last night with one of Dr. M’s colleagues &his wife. They have a beautiful home – a farm about an hour and a half north ofus. We had a great time – talked about everything under the sun. I spent a littlebit of time being obsessed with their stereogram collection – even if I was alittle bit cross-eyed at the end. Go here to read aboutstereograms. (Hint – it’s the 1800s version of Magic Eye.)·        I’m in the middle of reading StillLife with Crows by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child. It’s the fourthbook in the Special Agent Pendergast series, about a serial killer in a smallKansas town. It’s pretty graphic (think: the surgery channel), but I’m justfascinated by the way Pendergast’s mind works.OK, I’m hijacking my own post to include a couple of Wordzzles.I was supposed to post them yesterday, but I ended up posting my P365 late so Idecided to just sneak them in here. In case you’re wondering, a Wordzzle is astory using the words that Raven at Viewsfrom Raven’s Nest gives us each week. After you’ve read mine you should check hersout here.Words for the mini: fingers,flashlight, fanciful, daughter, musicAs soon as the music started, the flashlightslipped through Alex’s fingers. Thiswas not unusual – she was easily startled and dropped things all the time. Butthe music was unexpected. “Love MeDo” blasted from a supposedly empty house in the middle of the night.  What in the world was going on here? ImpromptuBeatles fan club meeting? Ooh – maybe it was a Beatles ghost fan club! Now that was the kind of fanciful thing her mother would dream up. Like mother, like daughter. Then Alex looked down at herfeet in suspicion. Yep, it was a Beatle’s welcome mat. She’d stood on it solong that it was segueing into “Hard Day’s Night.” She had a feeling that herbrother had sent her to his house on an “urgent” errand just to play thislittle joke. Ah well, she could probably come up with some sort of wickedpayback, just as soon as she got the silly mat to shut up.Words for the 10-word challenge: Sunday,think the rain'll hurt the rhubarb?, sleeveless shirt, house for sale, out andabout, spark, Oh, to be in England, angry, forgetfulness, in-coming“Incoming!”Mark was bellowing again. Sheila decided then & there to put a “House for Sale” sign in the front yard.She was tired of all the golf balls littering her yard every Saturday and Sunday. For some reason those were thedays that the worst duffers were out andabout. She was mostly kidding. She would hateto leave her garden. Or, rather, Mark’s garden. She asked him, “do you think the rain’ll hurt the rhubarb? I’mlooking forward to putting up some strawberry-rhubarb preserves.” Mark lookedup, an unaccustomed spark in hiseyes. Why, he was angry! He wasnever angry. His sleeveless shirtwas drenched with sweat. “Sheila,” he said, “I am losing patience with your forgetfulness! We decided to not plantrhubarb this year, remember? You wanted zucchini instead.” Mortified and confused, Sheila justlooked at him for a few minutes. She hadn’t remembered. There seemed to a greatdeal of forgetting these days. Sighing, she started reciting “Oh,to be in England” which she hadmemorized as a child, finding comfort in one thing remembered. She didn’tnotice Mark’s look of sadness as she turned away."},

I have a real problem with a theology that indicates that if you’re pooryou’re not being faithful to God. I’m pretty sure that’s not what Jesus was allabout. Of course, this could just be sour grapes on my part because I don’tknow a thing about the person driving the car. I just made up a whole storyabout them based on their license plate! And of course I don't want to imply that if you're successful you're not a good Christian. I'm shutting up now :)Thursday,July 21st      This is a popular vacation destination in our neck of thewoods. Filled up twice a day (or more) this week by Dr. M and his faithfulsidekick The Bug. Well, I filled it up once. I don't know why I find the cowbird to be so lovely - that sleek brown head just draws me in.Friday,July 22ndThis was supposed to be the Tax Time Pig, but someone was coming up behind me so I just stuck the camera out ofthe window & clicked. Unsuccessfully as you can see. So just imagine aconcrete pig with a ginormous Winnie-the-Pooh on its back.Dr. M was more successfulgetting pictures of the suet feeder – this is the guy we were trying to attractwith the food. And here's a pompous cardinal. I don't know why, but I just think that they look like they think they're better than everyone else. And why not? Pretty bird!Saturday,July 23rd We might wish for a woodpecker,but these guys are vastlyentertaining – the feeder just goes around and around while they take off &land on it.

It’s probably my cholesterol. Damn cookies. Heh.Periodically I have bouts of feeling extremely incompetent. This is one of those times. I know that it’s an illusion, because if I look at everything logically I’m no more incompetent than usual (which actually means that I’m fairly competent). But logic is just not on my agenda right this minute. Next week will be better.I was a shoplifter yesterday & didn’t know it. I purchased some items at Staples (I know you’re dying to know: ink cartridges, wrist rests for my keyboard & mouse, and a new lap desk for my mini laptop). When I got home & looked at the receipt I realized that the lap desk wasn’t on there. The cashier didn’t ring it up. Oops. So now I have to deal with that. I briefly entertained the notion of pretending that I didn’t catch the error, but I’m such a darn goody two shoes. Sigh.Well, I feel a little better having written all this down.

It’s a quick sort of pause & flee maneuver – I don’t linger, although he has a bowl of fun size Snicker bars on his credenza. I think, “Wow, the perfect use for a credenza!” As I head back down the hallway I ponder the total lack of sexual tension in the encounter. Not saying that I wanted any – even if I weren’t about 20 years older than this guy he is not my type. For one thing, he’s probably a republican! But back in the day, regardless of whether or not either one of us was interested, there would have been at least a smidge of tension there. Probably my weight (and the fact that I walk with a limp these days) is off putting. But I realize that I just don’t care anymore & I know that I broadcast my disinterest in tones too loud to be ignored. When I was younger and cuter (come on, don’t be all nice – you know I was cuter back then!) I practically vibrated with the desire to be noticed. And I think that I probably was noticed somewhat. I enjoyed all that byplay & double entendre & your place or mine (I just added that last part to make it interesting). But now? Don’t even go there buster! I’m happy with my marriage. I don’t want drama. And frankly, I just can’t muster the energy to pretend to flirt. I’m pretty sure I should be sad that I don’t care about sex appeal anymore. But meh.All these fleeting thoughts get me as far as the elevator when I have an aha! moment: This is probably why I’m overweight! Isn’t life so much simpler if people don’t really look at you? What’s sad about that little bit of insight is that I never really did have to beat people off during those supposed halcyon days. But apparently I subconsciously believe that if I get too cute I’ll be propositioned all the time. You know it’s not just the weight – it’s the attitude – the one with the disinterested broadcast. The weight is a symptom of the attitude. And now I’m exiting the elevator on the ground floor considering this revelation. What do I think about it? It's a lot to process. I go into the café next door to get some cookies to help me think better. That's called irony folks. Back in the cute & complicated days..."},

And, if so, would the tiny little person like a snack, or is she a health nut who would consider cheese cake to be pollution of the space ship? All of my philosophical ponderings include food.

In fact, he found perverse pleasure in the execution of his good name. What did a good name get you anyway, but more work? His nickname reflected his feelings on the subject precisely – he had spent more of his 80 years charging people for the bull he spouted than doing actual work. On this particular day he was heading through the park getting ready to set up his magic show on a tree stump near the rotunda. His eyes roamed over the landscape trying to assess the number of marks who might actually pay to see his show. He looked left, then right, then left again, startled into stopping in his tracks. Triplets. On a park bench. With ample bosoms encased in silly pink polka-dots. At least 80 years old. It was a sight designed to give a man’s heart whiplash. Unable to stop himself he headed over for a chat. Maybe these lovely octogenarians were in the mood for a little magic today."},

I got groceries. Washed dishes once. Wandered around the yard looking at things. Took a two hour nap yesterday. Nevertheless, I do have a few miscellaneous things to mention.Saturday night Dr. M & I went up to the Piatt Castles to hear a talk given by a man who has written a biography of Donn Piatt – one of the brothers who built one of the castles. Donn was apparently a piece of work and not afraid to speak his considerable mind. And he fought in the civil war, having had to enlist as a private because he annoyed Mr. Lincoln too much to be appointed a general. Afterward I heard him compared to Rush Limbaugh, but I still plan to read the biography once it’s published. On our way home from the Castles we saw thousands of lightning bugs. Well maybe not thousands, but it sure looked like thousands. And then we passed by an airfield & they were having a balloon glow. It was kind of a magical ride home (possibly less magical for Dr. M, who was driving).I’m pretty sure the Reds need a new closer. Not that I’m an expert or anything, but 3 blown saves out of 4 games might be a sign. Just saying.Upon the advice of my former boss I’ve been using baby wipes to wash my face at night (I may have mentioned this before). Wow, they are a lot cheaper than my Olay Facials. And they come in all these delicious flavors (I got cucumber aloe or some such yesterday). I had no idea, having avoided the baby aisle for lo these many years.My surgery is four weeks from today. Yikes! I had another round of “I’m not decrepit enough to need surgery. I’m getting around just fine. I don’t wanna!” And then I remembered that I take 2400 mg of ibuprofen and one vicodin every day and that maybe that’s not really good for me, long term. And also, vacuuming did me in for two days afterward. I know, I know, I’ve gone through this before but I’m sure this will not be the last you hear of the subject before August 8th. If the surgery weren’t so early I’d probably get up & post the same refrain that very morning!OK, that’s enough miscellany for today. What are you guys up to?P.S.

Frances’ father was a minister named Ernest & partof the lyrics talked about “my earnest prayer.” I had to smile – I guess I’mstrange like that.·        Iwas thrilled to have some of my family represented at the funeral – three aunts,daddy & Amy, and a cousin.·        I’mnot always about the food (ok, maybe I am always about the food), but I’m so thankful to whoever made the chicken& dumplings for the meal after the service. And that chocolate cake withthe Hershey bars.·        Dr.M & I really enjoyed the Daddy & Amy B&B – the beds are comfy,there’s free wifi, and the food is great!·        Onour way home yesterday we took a detour to Roan Mountain. Love those blowsy, fluffy,over the top rhododendrons!So,what are you thankful for today?Endeavor, Lino Tagliapietra, Columbus Museum of Art﻿A Different Kind of MusicI was listening to the Sultans of Swingbopping my head to the beat of the music(mostly to the beat anyway).They were deep in conversation,ignoring the fairly excellent musical stylings of the Dire Straits.Their eyes were intent on each flying finger.I wanted to eavesdrop, but all I heardwere explosions of color flung from their silent finger ballet.We so easily sling verbal arrows at one another.And I’m sure they could have been shoutingat each other with those fingers,but from my table? It was all a rainbow.Daddy's wife Amy (which makes her my step-mother & the only mother I have now unless you count various mother-aunts) got her master's degree after her children were grown and then taught at the NC School for the Deaf for many years before she retired. We were out eating pizza when she & Daddy saw a couple of folks signing to each other. I wasn't rude & didn't turn aroud to look, but I could imagine the scene... Then Daddy started singing along with the Dire Straits & that distracted me. Wouldn't it distract you too?   This is a Magpie Tale and a One Shot Wednesday.

{"title": "Grace Filled Jam", "date": "Sunday, June 26, 2011", "text": "Brian Miller is stirring the jam this week & has instructed us to write a poem based on our favorite song. I like music, but often sit in silence rather than listen to it. And in my car I listen to books (music just makes me want to ram people with my car). So in thinking about what song to consider for the poetry jam I kept thinking about Amazing Grace since church music is one pretty consistent thing in my life. But I decided to wait to see what kind of music they had at my mother-in-law’s funeral first. Of course one of the hymns we sang was Amazing Grace. Did you expect anything else?GraceWhat is gracebut the thing thatmakes a family?Your father’s eyesfill and overspillas he gazes upon his love,that final caressof eyes and heart.And I witness thismoment becausemy blind eyeswere openedthat long ago nightand I accepted thegift of unmistakablemiraculous grace -the gift of you.I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers …Philemon 1:4Go check out the other jammers here - I think it should be pretty interesting this week!Thanks to everyone for your condolences. We’ve been doing pretty well, considering. This week is all about flowers – as you might imagine since it’s June & we’ve spent part of the week in North Carolina.Sunday, June 19thWe got Father’s Day carnations at church today. I was glad to think of my father while I carried it around (um, not that I stopped thinking about him when I sat it down. Although of course I don’t think about him all the time. I’m shutting up now.)The daisies are blooming pretty well now. They make me smile.Monday, June 20thWe still think it’s hilarious that we have a red-wing blackbird that visits our yard.And the woodpecker feeder attracts more than just woodpeckers.  The Tax Time Pig is honoring fathers this week.These flowers are at the Tax Time Pig’s house – gorgeous!Tuesday, June 21st   Dr. M has been laughing at this sign that went up shortly after our really bad hailstorm in May. Clever marketing, I think.He passes this yard every now & then. It’s like that old poem, “back to back they faced each other, drew their swords & shot one another!” Or is that just me?Lovely!Wednesday, June 22ndThe weekly squirrel was kind of keeping it on the down low this week.Dr. M took this picture on his way to class. Love the yellow. Campus deer. Thursday, June 23rd     Wednesday evening Dr. M received the call we’d been expecting that his mother had passed away. Thursday morning when I went out to my car I saw that one of our lilies had finally bloomed. It was such a sign of hope & life that it brought both of us to tears. And like the proud parents we are, we each took a ton of pictures of it.The next morning this guy had bloomed too, but since it was 5:30 in the morning we didn’t get a picture.Daisy explosion!Here is the State of the Bug – frazzled from trying on 5 different dresses to wear to the funeral.Friday, June 24thWe made it to NC in time to go to the family viewing at the funeral home. There were some, um, interesting, family moments, but it was good to be with all of them for the most part. When we got back to my dad’s house I wandered around the yard taking pictures (yes, this is what I usually do down here).Saturday, June 11thThe funeral was in the morning, and although we weren’t sure it would, everything went smoothly. The service was nice, with just a hint of honky tonk gospel (Dr. M’s mom was a southern gospel groupie). I think that Dr. M enjoyed talking to people he hadn’t seen in years. And we laid his mother to rest in the same cemetery that holds her parents. When we got home Dr. M was reminded that life just continues on no matter what. I’m glad I’m not trying to feed these guys!Go to Sara’s blog here to see the blogs of all the other Project 365 participants."},

Not to mention look at vacation photos (he went to the Grand Canyon & is a pretty good photographer so I won't be suffering too much). Anyway, Dr. M & I took a journey to Chili's & one of the local Meijers stores today & there was a whole world of miscellany in just that one trip!Example #1: Before we even got out of the car at the restaurant, Dr. M's phone signaled a text: \"Happy baby daddy's day LOL.\" Is there something I need to know? Hmm? He often gets random strange texts from unknown persons - at least this is his story & he's sticking to it.Example #2: Everyone in the Meijer's was just roaming around ceaselessly in a daze. None of us could find anything & we were all looking up toward the aisle signs hanging from the ceiling. Why wasn't the kleenex with the other paper products? Where did they keep bathroom scales? Where are the granola bars? After I passed one lady twice I asked her if she thought she was in an episode of The Twilight Zone.Example #3: Look what I bought! A year's worth of dusting in one box! You think I'm kidding, don't you?Example #4: Dr. M brought this lamp to our marriage.In fact, he believes he's had it since 1979. It's been on all my desks for probably the last 15 years or so. And, finally, we decided it was time to get a new one. We decided to just throw caution to the wind & get something completely different:Well, the shade part is different anyway. Heh.On a more somber note, Dr. M got a call last night saying that he should plan to go visit his mother pretty soon. His family thinks that she is in her final decline. We're still not sure of the time frame, but he's going to get down there sometime next week. I wrote a poem about this waiting in tension earlier this month (here).I hope all you fathers out there have a great day! Moms too! And people who are not parents! Heck, everyone should have a great day - I insist!Specifically, however, I hope that this particular father gets to spend a lot of time doing this:Happy Father's Day Daddy!"},

I think that’s pretty self explanatory.• Dr. M did a post about the waterfall & covered bridge we saw on Saturday. Go here to look at it. Yesterday we went out after church & found two more covered bridges, including the one we were looking for on Saturday. You’ll get to see pictures of those next Saturday. • I had many separate issues going on which made me post this on Thursday, but here is one of the issues that repeatedly beats me down & yet I never seem to “get” it: When I have an unpleasant task ahead of me I stew, push it to the back of my mind where it stews some more, growing larger & larger until I can barely lift my head for all the stew. For example, I received my surgery packet a few weeks ago. It sat unopened on my desk at home for a couple of weeks. Then it sat for a few days on my desk at work. Friday morning I finally opened the thing, read through it, made a list of things I needed to do, & voila! I was about 20 pounds lighter. I worked like a maniac, bounced around, & then generally made a nuisance of myself with Dr. M later that night with being so ebullient. So, perhaps next time I have an unpleasant task ahead I should just do it. Like eating your peas first (except I like peas, so bad example).OK, I think that’s enough to get you through the day.

It also has some nice exhibits showing a store and tavern - and lots of hands on things for children.The house was built in 1807 and is pretty fascinating - mostly because of the garish color schemes that were popular at that time. Made my head spin just a little bit! Here are a few examples:It was also interesting to me because this family was quite wealthy, so the furnishings and their lifestyle was different from a lot of the historic homes I've visited. One feature that I especially loved was this serving cabinet - the servants could put food on it and then spin it around into the room. There was one in the drawing room & in the dining room. Sorry for the fuzziness - a result of low-light no-flash photography:While I enjoyed the house a lot, I loved ﻿the gardens. I went a little overboard on the pictures.﻿We visited some of the outbuildings - there was a field hands house that is apparently used for school children's visits. Here I am trying out one of the games. I think I could have mastered it after about 500 more tries. {Please note the extremely white legs - no, I am not wearing white stockings!}It seems like everywhere we go there are sheep. I'm not sure how this happens, but I think Dr. M is a sheep magnet.

Really, don't do it. You will thank me. It is, however, a great book so far. The boy next door just might send Dr. M and me over that mythical edge any day now.

After reviewing all the information (I have to hire home health care, really?) I decided that my hip just really doesn't hurt all that much & perhaps Dr. M should have surgery instead. I promise to be a good nurse. Once I finish my little freak-out I'll review the info more calmly & then call my doctor's office with all my questions. Or cancel the surgery.

So here’s some of my usual Monday drivel:·        Dr. M rousted me out of the house at the crazyhour of 10:00 (yes, I know that’s not really early. Yes, I know an hour earlierwould have been cooler. Your point?) to go to the Siebenthaler Fen for our Mayvisit. Since it’s the last week of May. It was pretty warm, but there was anice breeze and I enjoyed our ramble very much. I plan on making Dr. M do awhole post on our visit with all the pictures, so I’ll just share a couple few okay several hereby way of teaser. I’ll post the link to his blog once his post is complete.·        In a related note I wore shorts in public forthe first time this season & was afraid that I’d frighten small children,but in fact the one small child we saw on our journey just said, “hey,” &didn’t seem afraid at all. So that’s good.·        My tomato seedlings don’t look all that strongso we bought some plants at the Kroger yesterday. We’ll try to work with theseedlings too, but we wanted some healthier looking ones just in case.·        I keep falling asleep on the futon in theevenings. That’s usually Dr. M’s job. I reckon I’m still fighting off thiscough. The good news is that Mucinex totally takes away my appetite. In fact,unless someone points out an obvious flaw in the plan, I might just keep takingit until I get to my goal weight. Heh.·        I struggled mightily this past weekend since theBraves were playing the Reds. Dr. M has no divided loyalties, so he was happythat the Braves took 2 out of 3. But Bronson’s so cute! Don’t worry if you don’tunderstand any of this – I know I’m strange.OK, that’s enough of that. Hope you’re enjoying the holiday(if it is one for you)."},

I met my aunt's boyfriend when I was very small. And here's what happened.Ode to DougI hid behind her legs,afraid of this tall stranger.Did I look you in the eye?Did I say, “hey?”Or did I press my face against her knee?I don’t remember.I don’t rememberyou leavingor how you diedin that foreign land.I don’t rememberher griefor how she held youto her heart.But Iremember you nowand echo thesong“War, whatis it good for?Absolutelynothing.”Tomorrow we honor those fallen in war.

Well, actually I did think about it, but Ihadn’t polished my toenails.  Saturday,May 28thI’ve been knocked for a loopwith all my coughing lately so I slept really late – and then took anothersnooze after breakfast.

I feel relief that he is gone, but I grieve for hisdeath. Maybe not the end of his particular life as he choseto live it, but the one that he might have lived if he had been a better man,the one that all of us might live: a life of goodness, kindness, and peace. Her post also challenges me to try to be a better person –to remember that justice isn’t just something appropriate for other people. Asshe says, I’ve often behaved as though allalong, what I’ve really been pledging is liberty and justice for me.

It was not God'sintention for him to become a dealer in horror and death…And she said: Those of us whose heartsstill skip a beat when we see a low-flying plane -- we are a little quiet.

We discussed the two surgicaloptions available to me: hipresurfacing or total hip replacement. You may click the link to read abouthip resurfacing, but the picture above shows the difference between the too. Basically it’s a way to preserve bone & uses lesshardware. It is used on younger more active people because you are able to bemore active after that type of hip surgery rather than with total replacement.I’m not particularly active; however, the idea of losing less bone sounds likea good idea. And who knows – after this surgery I might become more active. Isure hope so!Although I got a number of recommendations, I will probablyuse the surgeon I saw today. However, I can’t have surgery until August, so I havetime to change my mind. He’s just so convenient to my office. I know – that shouldbe the least of my considerations, but there you go.Between now & August I plan to work very hard to losesome weight.

And you know, I'm actually thankful about that - he probably will be very interested in my hip. I hope. I'm thankful I have an appointment with him tomorrow. ·         I'm thankful for the internet so I can look up the numbers of mysterious callers to see who they are. The one this evening was not a bill collector (not that we're past due on anything, but since I work for a collection agency that's the first thing I think). It was Discover card wanted to sell Dr. M something. No thanks Discover!·        Today was mostly gorgeous - in the 60s, sunny. When I got home I almost pulled out our swing, but since I'm having trouble even walking [slight exaggeration - it's just pretty painful right now] I decided that trying to woman-handle that thing wasn't the best idea. ·         The Reds are undefeated! Of course, the pitcher has walked the three batters & given up four runs in the first inning this evening so that record might not make it until the end of the season.It’s your turn! What are you thankful for today?"},

I was fascinated by the dance and had a number of friends on the team, but since I have absolutely no rhythm whatsoever there was no question that I’d actually participate. I just tagged along so I could drool over those flying feet (and I probably had a crush on one or more of the guys - I don't exactly remember, but it was probably a lanky blonde named Pony. Sigh). But apparently, one rainy night I was having a little trouble finding the love, so I sat in the balcony & wrote this.

I think I’m seeing a pattern here. Groggy from my out of control weekend of grocery shopping, fen hopping, and churchery, I am in no condition to be coherent. My poor boss. I know, I lead such a glamorous life. Nevertheless, I am providing a list of items for your perusal.• Baseball season has officially started! Dr. M & I thought we were quite the stuff yesterday as we had the Reds on the TV & the Braves on my computer & we were able to keep up with both games despite the fact of all the red uniforms. My idea of bliss. • I have a routine doctor’s appointment today, however, I plan to shake it up a bit by asking the doctor WHAT THE HECK CAN I DO FOR ALL THIS EXTRA HIP PAIN THESE DAYS!! Yes, all caps is exactly how I feel about the situation. How can I lose the necessary weight if I can’t even walk properly? (I realize that not eating so much would help tremendously). • Dr. M has had another couple of good posts lately. Click here to see all the birds we’ve been encountering lately. And click here to see some of our pottery and lucky buckeyes. • I’ve been dreaming about babies again. And as you might expect, since I’ve never had a child, my dreams often involve trying to figure out what all stuff I need for a new baby. Apparently, in my dreams I don’t prepare for the babies at all. They just show up somehow & expect me to be competent. So, since I believe that dreaming of babies signals change & not some untapped maternal urge, I am anticipating a heck of a change in the next few weeks. I just hope it’s a good one!All right, that’s all I can manage for today. Tune in tomorrow night when I may or may not post a poem about clogging!"},

Don’t get me wrong, Istill think it’s quite a saga, if only of interest to me. So why am Icasting these personal pearls before you? Perhaps in the vain hope thatsharing my misery will lessen its sting.In1964 I was working on my father’s dairy farm. My young bride was about to givebirth to our first child. I had been up since dawn being a dairyman and now Iwas expecting to deliver this child.

I’ll try youon for size! WW, I am not too sure about this at all. I know you think you’resharp as a tack, but begging your pardon, I haven’t really known youall that long. Have you ever delivered anything other than a calf?”“NowCJ,” I admonished, “I’ve got the pot ready for boiling water, the papertowels to clean up the mess, and the sage to put under your pillowto keep you grounded.” I could understand her concern, but she didn’t know howthe thought of delivering my own child made me salivate. My plan had eightpoints, an octagon of a plan, if you will. But I never had the chance toimplement even one of the points. While I was gathering my supplies, CJ wascalling the ambulance.Inthe hospital several hours later, my dream flat as a pancake, I fellasleep in the waiting room.A fewyears ago I talked to CJ about that day. She remembered me falling asleep, butnot that I wanted to deliver the baby at home. I wonder now, was this dreamdeferred really just a dream I had napping in the hospital?

Dr. M has worked late most nights & only took two of the pictures below (I know! It’s usually the other way around).

My hair sure clashes with all that red something FIERCE. {Shudder}Wednesday, March 23rdIt was a Simpson’s sky on Wednesday – gorgeous!I finally remembered to start my tomato seeds. First of all, Dr. M had gotten me this starter kit.Then I totally drowned it in water & the little pod things got really unruly.Here they are after I corralled them & planted the seeds. Mostly tomatoes & a little basil. Um – last year we ended up with four really healthy tomato plants & had almost more tomatoes than we could manage. I think that perhaps I didn’t really need to plant seeds in ALL the pods. Oh well, with any luck I can run a little tomato stand in the front yard come June or July.Thursday, March 24th      We got the car back on Tuesday, but I was still driving the rental (we got a cheaper rate for a week).

Especially, if you click on the picture to make it larger, you can see a jet tail in there – makes me think of a missile or something.Friday, March 25thI stopped to check out the sheep & donkeys on my way home. I love this picture best for some reason.Dr. M had a late gig at school, for the third night in a row, and I decided that I’d had enough fast food. So I actually prepared a meal for myself – teriyaki chicken, pierogies & my dad’s green beans. I know that looks like a lot of pierogies for one person – but that’s all I really wanted to eat – the chicken & green beans are just the beard* to make it look like a real meal. Except I ate them too. Glutton!Saturday, March 26th Today I went to Columbus to have lunch with a friend & then check out the Ohio Craft Museum because it’s the last weekend of the Texas Chair Project – which contains a chair made by Ellen Abbott & her husband Marc Leva. The whole exhibit was really cool & Ellen & Marc’s chair is pretty fabulous. I took a picture with it to prove I was there, but my arm isn’t really long enough to get a good picture with our Nikon. I’m posting it anyway! Here are a couple of the other little chairs.And here are a couple of the Artful Chairs – the larger ones made by mostly Ohio artists.I enjoyed my visit to the museum – and I must say that this Saturday has been much better than the last one!

He’s apparently my brother inself-deprecation, so I like him especially. Of course, unlike me, he isactually a very good writer. Justkidding! About the “unlike me” part, I mean, not about his writing. No yelling!Okay moving on. He gave us achoice of three prompts. One was to write a poem about pancakes (in honor ofShrove Tuesday) in the voice of your favorite poet, & I was going to writelike Dr. Seuss, but it’s Friday and apparently there’s no rhyming in my head onFriday. Another prompt was to write a poem in the style of a French rondeau,but again with the rhyming. Maybe later. So, I’m left with the third option,which was to write about Stupid Things Done When Drunk. Now, onthe surface, since I don’t drink, you might think this one would be impossiblefor me. But I do recall one instanceabout 22 years ago. If you’ll notice, the first lines might indicate that I wasplanning to rhyme this thing, but in the spirit of being foggy in the head thatnotion just devolved into the effort below.Fuzzy Navel*I never was a drinker – in fact I never am.Could I hold my liquor?Your guess is as good as mine.I thought to tie one onabout a score agowith a drink made from fruit – that should be easy enough.Two hours later (making that awful awful pucker face)I took my last tiny sipfrom my one drink,imagined that my lips tingledand worried aboutdriving myself home.Wander on over to Peter’splace to read some other great poems. But beware, once you’re finished youmight have a powerful hankering forsome pancakes. *A fuzzynavel is a mixed drink made from peach schnapps and orange juice. Generally an equal amount of each component is usedto concoct it, although quantities may vary. It can also be made with lemonade or asplash of vodka depending on the drinker's taste. By adding 1 or 1½ oz of vodka tothe fuzzy navel you have what is called a hairy navel, the more\"hair\" referring to the increased strength of alcohol in the drink.From Wikipedia"},

{"title": "Self-Deprecation", "date": "Monday, February 28, 2011", "text": "Recently, a woman I respect told me to stop insultingmyself. It actually made me cry, a little, because she’s so very right, but Idon’t know how to stop. Self-deprecation is a way of life for me and mostly, itworks. But if it’s annoying to other people – well I don’t want to be annoying.Here is how it started.When I was young it felt like people had these vast expectations. I was going to growto be 6 feet tall & play basketball! I was going to be schoolValedictorian! I was going to be a concert pianist! I was going to bebeautiful. Now, notice that I said it feltlike people thought these things about me. I don’t really have any evidence tosupport that, but it’s what clenched my gut. So in defense I started being “lessthan” so that people would be pleasantly surprised when I had a success. And Ireally liked their pleased surprise – much more than I liked their supposedexpectation. Playing myself down became an important strategy so that I couldplease people in a way that felt comfortable to me. And playing myself downhelped me support my habit of not wanting to work too hard. I could just get byon minimum effort and then “zing!” I’d do something special.Now see how I slipped that self-deprecation in there soslickly? “…my habit of not wanting to work too hard…” If I spoke truth I wouldsay that what really happened is thatI worked faster & better than other people, so I was done sooner, so I couldgo read my book or whatever I really wanted to do. And that behavior has justbeen reinforced in the work world – my boss desperately gives me tasks to keepme busy & I still finish in plenty of time to feed my blog habit.I’m getting sidetracked. That’s how it started, this habitof putting myself down. But then I thought it was kind of funny. I don’t likehumor that puts down someone else – it makes me uncomfortable. But it seemslike there has to be a victim in humor, so I prefer it to be me.The sad part, the part that made me cry when I read the “stopinsulting yourself” comment, is that for the most part I believe this stuff I say about myself. I am clumsy. I am adingbat. I am overweight and out ofshape. I am a shallow person who can’tcontribute anything of substance to the conversation so let’s just say thisfunny thing instead.I really am. And if I can’t find humor in that, then wherecan I go? I don’t want to read my blog anymore if I can’t find humor. But Ialso don’t want people to think I hate myself. I don’t! I think I’m flawed, butI still care very much for that kid who was afraid she was going to be 6 feettall, and I care for the 5’4” adult that I am now.Maybe I’m not as shallow as I think I am. I write prettydamn fine poetry. There! I said it! Now let’s get to the believing part…"},

Words for the mini:foster children, window washer,chipmunks, chip, pillage“Watchyour steps dearies,” Druscilla said to the fosterchildren from next door, carefully wending her way through the spoils ofher recent antiquing venture. She had to admit that the pillage was out of control, and she once again felt a twinge ofguilt at getting the goods so cheaply. Fortunately the twinge was short lived.It didn’t do to have too much of a conscience in this business. The childrenwere chattering like chipmunks (orat least like Chip & Dale),never having seen so much old stuff in one place before. “Ok, I have jobs for bothof you. Who wants to be the windowwasher and who wants to dust?”Nextdoor, Cecilia luxuriated in her scented bath.

Why, my pulse is stillcrazy just thinking about it. Let me startfrom scratch with my story. It will astound you as well, I’m sure.Iwanted farm grown tomatoes. A simpledesire, and I decided to go to an actual farm to get them. March Hare Farm is just down in the next county, so I headed thereone fine summer afternoon. I had parked in the farm yard and proceeded to thedoor of the house, when I felt a missile strike me on my left shoulder.Perplexed, I looked around for its source. And felt another blow to my back. Iwhirled around (getting annoyed at this point) and looked up. Upon the parapet on the roof (for that is whatit resembled) was a goose! And itwas flinging what appeared to be icecubes in my direction! Ice cubes! Well,I hied myself under the safety of the porch roof and pounded on the door. Tothe fetid hag who answered the doorI shouted, “Goose! Ice Cubes! Parapet!” while trying to not breathe the airaround her (I’m fairly certain she had not bathed in many days). She stared at me uncomprehendingly for about 30 secondsbefore she said, very slowly, in a loud, stern voice, “Harold, you are to getdown off the roof now, take off thatblasted goose costume, and apologize to this lady!” Then with what I supposedshe thought was a kindly smile, she asked, “Now, ma’am, how can I help you?” At that point I was quite sure that I didn’t want anything from thisinsane asylum, so I just told her I had changed my mind and raced for my car. Canyou believe that? I took pictures of the bruises in case I ever needed totestify in court. You know, because folks like that will surely be arrested for something someday. Why, I can’t help butwonder how many bodies are buried under those tomato plants even now. Wait– I heard that. I am not “melodramatic much!” I’m not!"},

That picture reminded me of this one – do you reckon Ididn’t want to have my picture made?Thursday,February 24th     Thursday night we realized that neither of us had taken apicture. So I ran back to the bathroom & took a picture of some penguinsilly bandz my niece had given me for Christmas. I keep the package on my desk& some evenings when my hair bugs me I pull it back with a band - &then just hang the band in the bathroom when I’m getting ready for bed. I don’tknow why the two I have here are black – there are lots of other colors.After I took that picture I got intrigued by all the lovelycolors of the weather pattern that was bringing more snow to our area.

{"title": "The Poetry Bus Gets Fleeced!", "date": "Friday, February 25, 2011", "text": "TFE isdriving the bus! He gave us some really intriguing pictures, with thestipulation that our poem had to be 14 lines long, and I thought I was writinga poem for the second picture. But when I came up for air my effort had nothingwhatsoever to do with a couple of boys, a donkey and a dog. So I decided thatit matched, vaguely, the prompt regarding the Van Morrison song. Here are ourinstructions:“Plan B, Van Morrison has a song,'You Don't Pull No Punches But You Don't Push The River' [go hereto hear the song – it’s worth your while in my opinion].

At least they’re clean, & I’d like to say that I was extra careful driving in today (to save the paramedics), but in truth I just drove as I usually did.I’m thankful that in my dream last night my mother seemed to be handling her incarceration in the federal pen rather well. My uncle Bill was there too. I don’t know what they did – but I suspect it has something to do with the Brookford Mafia (this is an inside joke) and I want to know where my share of the dirty money is!I’m thankful that work has been busier than usual, but not overwhelmingly so. Contrary to popular opinion I like to be busy. So there.I’m thankful that despite the fact that I was burning up this morning I did actually put at least a light raincoat on before leaving for work. I’ll probably appreciate it when I leave work this evening. It’s such a struggle for me to visualize being cold later when I’m hot now. I’m thankful for Greg at Greg’s General Store for hosting the Thankful Thursday posts. He’s moving on from the blogging world (he wants to have a REAL life – imagine that!). We’ll miss him, but I understand the need to disconnect from this electronic age. Not that I plan to do it myself anytime soon :)That’s it for today – what are YOU thankful for?P.S.

Should I be concerned? I’m eating it anyway.Like how I wish I had brought my camera into the office so I could take a picture of the giant mountain of peas on top of the ravioli – I’m not very good at eyeballing portion sizes so I just dumped the whole thing on there. Eh – we all need extra peas every now & then, right? We won’t discuss how the container they were in had measurement markings on the side so I should have known how many peas I had.Like how Annie Parsons is going to Haiti & you can download some of her songs to help pay her way (she leaves Friday, so hurry!). She is such a good singer/songwriter.Like how I got to wondering about the fact that my gynecologist told me a couple of years ago that I would need to stop taking birth control for a period of time so they could do some blood test for menopause. But if I don’t have any symptoms because the birth control masks it why would I want to stop just to see? Does that make sense? And why am I thinking about it now?Like how last night when I went to turn my computer off I started looking for the timesheet program so I could clock out. Clock out from the weekend. I guess that’s about right!Like how I was complaining about our rain (I know – I’m such a whiner!) until I read Karie’s blog post about how we need rain for spring.

Well, yesterday we finally returned. I guess we missed out on the every month thing, didn't we? Yesterday was sunny and sort of approaching warmth, but once we got on the trail it was really breezy & I discovered that 43 degrees in the shade feels very different that 43 degrees in the sun. But it was nice to do a little bit of outdoor walking. Would you like to join us?The entrance looks very inviting, doesn't it?As we approached the walk I decided to read the signs.Hmm - this seems somewhat ominous. But we press on.OK, yes, there is some flooding. But it only went over the top of my boots, so we decided to persevere. And quickly saw evidence of the beavers' handiwork.Ah, here is where we believe the culprits live!But I found the watery milieu beautiful in its on way.But then we encountered an obstacle that could have perhaps been overcome by hip waders (or excellent balance on slippery boards).So we turned back and paid attention to the ice that was still a thin layer on the water. Dr. M said it felt like being inside a chilled margarita glass. Hmm - I wonder how he knows what the inside of a margarita glass feels like?As we left we decided that this year we really will go back again every month. Really! So keep your eye out for a March post.*Fen: n. A fen is a type of wetland fed by surface water, or groundwater, or both. Fens are characterised by their water chemistry, which is neutral or alkaline. Fens are different from bogs, which are acidic, fed primarily by rainwater (ombrotrophic) and often dominated by Sphagnum mosses.[1] [From Wikipedia]"},

My dad then informed me that carrots do well in raised beds, which is what we have. I did NOT need to know that. • Yesterday I went to get groceries just wearing the blazer I had worn to church! No coat! No hat! No gloves! Today is extra breezy, but still relatively warm (in the 40s).• I guess I sort of knew that the Grammys were on last night, but we were watching a show about American Indian removal instead. Such is the life in a historian’s home :) It was a pretty good show.• This morning I went to the dentist. They think my teeth are great – no problems today. It’s because I finally started flossing regularly in my 30s – otherwise I’m quite cavity prone. I still get them, but not nearly as often. So, the PSA of today is FLOSS!• Because it’s so breezy I sometimes had to actually use two hands while driving in to work.

I think Kim is a beautiful woman (inside & out, actually) and I just really don’t understand why a person with her coloring would ever not be considered beautiful.

A caustic remark on the tip of her tongue, she glared at the young man talking loudly on his cell phone. Young people today were so rude. And he wasn’t the only one – casting covert glances around the bus Bella saw that almost everyone was on a device of some sort. Listening to God Knows What with those little ear phones. Typing frantically with their thumbs. Reading those books that aren’t books on those rectangular gadgets. Living in today’s world was a delicate dance between all that she knew & loved and what she needed to learn to survive. And she had never danced very well. Except for that brief moment when she was a young girl. Love was a ballet in her memory and she the prima ballerina. She wondered what had become of her young man – and that young girl, for that matter. Sigh.

Ordinarily recipes might as well be runes to her, so, flushed from her efforts (or the heating vent she’d forgotten to shut off) the Bug was very pleased to present Dr. M with the fruits of her labor that evening – a romantic Valentine’s Day meal. There was a candle in their one Poppies on Blue candle holder & she’d actually dug out their tablecloth. She’d made baked chicken, green beans, & mashed potatoes & gravy. The gravy was from an envelope, but it wasn’t too lumpy – unlike the mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes are just stubborn in her opinion. For dessert there were from scratch sugar cookies with red sprinkles. She presented them to him with much drama. After taking a bite, he said slowly, “These are…interesting.” “Just interesting?” the Bug asked, warning chimes going off in her head. “Yes, interesting,” he affirmed.Cautiously, she took a bite. Hmm – interesting. “These aren’t red sprinkles, are they?” she asked. “No, they’re not,” he said. “it’s paprika, isn’t it?” she asked. Muscles quivering as he tried to hold in his laughter, Dr. M replied that he did believe that’s what was on the cookies. She inquired about whether they would taste better if she renamed them Sweet & Spicy Cookies and he determined that a new name would definitely help in marketing them – to other people."},

But this is the day I tell you about it. Aren’t you excited?I’m thankful that we never lost power during the recent storm, and that we didn’t even get inconvenienced that much. Although Dr. M was prepared for practically any eventuality. This is why I keep him around :)I’m thankful that my strategy of designating an audio book as an “exercise-only” book is really working. I look forward to hopping on my Gazelle each evening to see what Anita Blake is up to. I’m hoping to increase my workout times to make the book go faster – see, I’m motivated!I’m thankful that I can already tell a tiny difference in my stamina after working out for about a week. I’ve been taking the stairs more at work & I’m breathing a lot easier at the top than I used to. Now, my hip hurting is another matter, but I know that exercise ultimately helps arthritis so I plan to not be discouraged by any extra pain.I’m thankful that Dr. M & I have discovered a way to save a good bit of money each year on our cell phone plans. I’m not getting a smart phone, but I like my little flip phone just fine. I’m thankful for stock options to help cover unexpected expenses (ooh – didn’t that sound all Captain of Industry! Trust me, this is small potatoes.)I’m thankful for a new spirituality which Dr. M introduced to our household (more on this later).Okay! That’s enough thankfulness from me today. What are you thankful for? Or, for what are you thankful. Whichever. Please go check out Greg's blog to see other thanksgivings. (Although he's crazy today talking about it's almost spring when it was 11 degrees when I left my house this morning. Heh. Oops - that didn't sound very thankful!)"},

And tomorrowwe’re going to have ice and/or snow and/or rain. They’re not really sure. Youknow I’ll report back to you about it. This morning I emailed Dr. M that I thought itwas RUDE that it was 14 degrees when I left the house. I guess I wasn’texpecting it to be that cold. (A little voice inside my head is going, “hellooosilly girl - January in Ohio!”) Dr. M said that it was rude up at school too. I can’t remember if I’ve mentioned this on here,but I downloaded an audio book that I can only listen to while I’m exercising.So far it’s working – I’ve Gazelled four days in a row. It’s Guilty Pleasures - a vampire mysterybook (the first one of the Anita Blake series). I find that listening to a bookabout vampires really encourages me to work out harder. Do I think I’m runningaway? Whatever works! In my car I’m listening to The Girl with theDragon Tattoo. I’m fascinated by the mystery in the book. I don’t know why Iassumed it was an entirely different kind of book, but it’s right down myalley. I realized yesterday after I recorded thevideo that I actually don’t say, “remote” – I say “clicker.” I felt thatwas a vital item to clear up. I feel better now. I’ve been sitting here for 5 minutes & Ihave nothing else to say so I’m shutting up now.Are you in the storm’spath? Inquiring minds want to know!"},

I remember when I was a childvisiting my aunt & uncle in West Virginia (this was the trip where Ilearned that North Carolina fought for the south – devastating to me! Why werewe call North Carolina if we wererebels?) the local kids loved to ask me to say things like “rice” and “pocketbook.” Apparently I sounded pretty southern then. Perhaps I lost my accentwhile giving speeches in high school. Or maybe it was in Zambia where I wastrying especially hard to articulate.

I’ve been muttering at my computer so much (aren’t thereany cheap cell phone plans?)that Dr. M is threatening to get out the Bug Spray. Or charter aboat to escape the madness. I might not have a lot of ambition, but atleast having a job keeps me out of his hair for five days a week and just mightsave our marriage!Words for the 10 worder: kissing cousins,macaroni and cheese, chasm, orange glow, bucket list, eucalyptus, charged,handy, superior, eagerly   Yvonne was pretty sure that sneakinginto an empty building in the middle of the night was not on her bucket list. Learning to water ski on Lake Superior,yes. Not-so-eagerly running across the chasm of the parking lot,no. Empty buildings were kissing cousins of haunted houses in heropinion, and to be avoided at all costs. Entering the lobby she noticed afamiliar scent in the air – was that eucalyptus incense? And under heroffice door there was an orange glow reminiscent of cheap macaroniand cheese (an analogy that made Yvonne realize she’d missed dinner). Wasit on fire? And wouldn’t that just be handy? She returns to the officeto get her forgotten cell phone (charged by this time) and it’s on fire.Opening the door she saw the candles first, then the incense burners, and thenthe tangle of arms & legs on her desk. The security guard was using heroffice for a tryst – eww! Grabbing her phone, Yvonne ran out of the officemaking a note to call maintenance in the morning – she needed a new deskpronto. And they should fumigate the office while they’re at it! The theme this week is, “how long oh Lord?” Cold, gray, snow covered days. Thank goodness for the occasional cardinal and for neighbors who still want to bring light to this monotone land.Sunday, January 23rdSpeaking of cardinals… I wonder what the grass is going to look like under the feeder? If the snow ever melts I guess we’ll find out! I was amused that my new gloves matched my dish cloth. Did you know that the gloves work much better when they don’t have a hole in them? It’s true! Monday, January 24th Dr. M took this picture on his way to school. Sigh. Tuesday, January 25th This is the State of the Bug picture for the week. On Monday I saw a wrench light on my dashboard so Dr. M drove the Saturn to see if he could tell what might be wrong (nothing, thank goodness!). So here I am getting to drive the Bugly to work! (Click here to read about the Bugly.) I actually prefer to drive my Saturn, but the Bugly was a fun switch for a day. Many of our neighbors in town still have Christmas lights up. It’s just so dreary that we are most grateful for the chance to smile as we drive by. And, appropriately, one house has left its Abominable Snowman in the yard. Thanks Dr. M for capturing the silliness! Wednesday, January 26th The practice field at Dr. M’s university. Let’s just sigh again :)Thursday, January 27th Woo hoo! I got to go to lunch with a friend! We went to an Indian buffet – very reasonable & yummy. S didn’t even mind me taking her picture – perhaps she just decided that it was inevitable & that she should just get it over with. When she used to work with me people would ask if she was my daughter. Which I think technically could have happened, but it would have been a scandal. Friday, January 28th Lots of pictures today – most of them taken by Dr. M. And here is one he took to prove that not all of our roads are snowy! On my way home from work I saw a patch of blue sky!! Saturday, January 29th When I got home yesterday this was on my computer desk – Dr. M bought bugs for his Bug :) I’ll leave you with another cardinal picture.

The only lingering symptom is that my voice wants to go away too. Dr. M might consider that a blessing except that its absence hasn’t made me stop talking, so I’m even more annoying. I exaggerate – my voice isn’t really all the way gone, just trying to head that way.I took a three hour nap yesterday. Three Hours! And had no trouble at all getting to sleep last night. So of course I’m concerned that I have some kind of disease where I sleep all the time. And I do have such a disease. It’s called WINTER. Sigh.This morning as I was walking into the building I tripped on a rug and did a face plant. Well, actually, my face didn’t hit the ground, but most of the rest of me did. I was just grateful that I didn’t land on my tail bone since it’s finally almost healed from my April 2009 injury. So now I have all of these extra aches & pains. And the humiliation. Because of course there were witnesses. I can’t believe they didn’t laugh – I usually laugh (even though I feel terrible about it). They were nicer than I am. Thank goodness. But I wish there’d been a video – I think it would have been fairly entertaining to post it here.I’m not feeling very creative these days. I don’t want to write. I don’t want to read. Mostly I just want to play solitaire on the computer and sleep. But I don’t think that’s an ok action plan for the next few months until spring, so tonight I’m going home & doing some form of exercise. That should help with the energy level.

In addition to a dramatic increase in my usual workload, my old boss in HR is between admins so I've been helping her, and the admin for our president quit unexpectedly, so I've been helping him.

Well, that's actually probably not that different, is it?I'm also thankful for my Bible Study group. We're small, but mighty.

I slept pretty well last night but then apparently needed a two hour nap this morning too. I am just now starting to feel human again, just in time for the nighttime coughing to start. But tonight I will. Not. Give. In. No meds other than cough drops or it will be dangerous for me to drive to work.  And lord knows we don't need any negative factors other than my own insanity to affect my driving.Dr. M was awesome today. I sat groggily up on the futon this morning & announced that I needed to do some laundry (this is true – all my work pants were dirty – it's like after three days off I decided I would never have to go to work again). He told me to go back to sleep & then he did my laundry. And then later in the day when I still looked fairly confused about life he went to get groceries. I did bestir myself to vacuum & mop while he was gone.I just realized that I haven't taken a picture today – excuse me while I grab the camera…There – I took a picture of our Christmas tree. I may have mentioned before that I suggested that we leave it up until March. It's not in the way. It makes me smile. So there!I'm in the midst of reading another free book on my kindle. It's a mystery/romance. And one of the characters is supposed to be speaking in a Texas dialect. It's VERY distracting, but mostly because she keeps saying \"ya'll\" to the main character. I'm sure I've ranted on here before about this, but in my world \"ya'll\" is a contraction of \"you all\" and is not used to address just one person – unless you know that they have multiple personalities. I know that in other areas of the country \"ya'll\" is used differently. But oh my heavens I can hardly stand to read it that way. (I'm taking deep breaths to calm myself down again). I know I'll finish the book because I want to know what the mystery is, but it's slow going.While I battled the effects of cold meds today, other people celebrated the life of a man who was a force for change in the world. A complicated man, and a dynamic one. He could have used that charisma for other pursuits, ones that would most likely have not gotten him killed. But instead he took that burden and raised it over his head & flung it out into the world to shatter at the feet of complacent America. …when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, \"Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\" Martin Luther King, Jr."},

Where in the world was its mate? Under the bed? No, although there was a pile of overdue library books (oops!) and one empty plate. After checking in the closet (no luck) she carried the plate to the kitchen. Just for fun she checked the freezer (nope!), but she did see tonight's chicken in there beside a box of popsicles and, mysteriously, a pack of chewing gum. Putting the gum on top of the fridge and the chicken in the fridge to thaw, (she checked twice to make sure of the order), she meandered to the living room.

I'm not terribly sick, but I decided to keep my coughing self home out of the snow. Speaking of snow, all the way home last night I was composing this incredibly witty piece about driving in the dark with the snow blowing all over the interstate so that you're unable to see the lanes. And yet, somehow, still driving 60 mph. But I decided that might be too hair-raising. Not to mention that I don't really remember what was so witty about it. The fact that I'm warning you from ever driving anywhere near me?So instead of that fascinating topic I'm going to do my little Kindle review. I've read one and a half books & now consider myself an expert (this is so not true – I haven't even tried most of its extra features). But nevertheless, here is a list for your consideration.*The Kindle by itself is very lightweight, easy to carry around, read in bed, in the tub (unless you think you might drop it in, but I've only ever dropped one book in so I think the odds are in my favor).*The screen is not backlit. In fact it's a lot like reading a regular book in the way that it looks. Apparently it's supposed to be easier on the eyes this way (and easier to read out in the sun). However, this does mean that you need a book light if you're reading in a dim room. I bought a cover for mine that has a slot for a book light and that works very well for me. The cover does add to the total weight, but it's still only about as heavy as a paperback.*I chose my particular cover for its function – you can prop the Kindle up and read during lunch! Which is exactly what I did today.*I find that going back to look at previously read pages is a pain in the patootie. Partly this is because I'm a non-texter, so the little keyboard is hard for me to navigate (such tiny buttons!). I think if you're a little more competent you might have an easier time of it. There is a highlight & a bookmark feature which might help, should you know which portions you might want to look at again. Since I'm always thinking things like, \"now what state is this book set in?\" bookmarking might not be as useful for that purpose.*If you'd like to hear your Garmin read to you, then there is a text to voice feature. It's not quite the same as listening to an audio book. Heh.*When you leave it idle, or turn it off, a cool screensaver comes on. The screensaver is usually a portrait of a writer – who knew Alexander Dumas looked like that?*There are convenient buttons on both sides to turn the pages backwards or forwards – but it does make handling it a bit tricky when you're moving around (I like to walk around the house & read) – I'm always turning pages inadvertently just from picking it up.*Hands down, my favorite feature is that you can increase the text size. No more reading glasses! Except for those pesky buttons…*I am intrigued by the fact that the two free random mysteries I downloaded are both by Christian writers. I didn't set out to select those types of books, but that's what I got. In any case, I really enjoyed the first one I finished (sort of like a Baptist Mrs. Pollifax).In conclusion, I'm inconclusive. I don't know yet whether the pluses (light weight! Big letters!) outweigh the minuses (flipping through pages). Hmm – if being able to flip through pages is the only con perhaps I've just convinced myself. I will say that I'm allergic to book mold so that wonderful aesthetic of being able to enjoy a great find at a used book store is fraught with peril for me. The Kindle is probably hypoallergenic LOL.Ok, I'm going to stop talking now – back to my book!"},

My stories today are pretty mundane, but I'm just getting back into the swing of things. Cut me some slack! Oh, yes, that last was directed at my own self.Go to Raven's blog to check out the other participants. I promise you'll enjoy it!The mini (research, insane, clarity, toy mouse, lottery)Glancing down at the cheeseburger, I grimaced, and then indulged in one of my favorite fantasies about a toy mouse coming to life & eating the cheese & then biting the ankles of the waitress who forgot to tell the kitchen to leave it off. Don’t get me wrong – I love cheese (I’m not insane) – but it’s always the first thing to go when I’m trying to cut calories. Sigh. I’m not sure why I care – I had done a lot of research this morning into different methods of losing weight and compared them to my habits and strengths and weaknesses. My conclusion was that I had a better chance of winning the lottery than losing weight on any of these. After wolfing down the cheeseburger, I headed back to the office where I had a moment of clarity and went to www.weightwatchers.com. Not a diet, they say. A lifestyle change. Well, we’ll see, won’t we? Just in case though, I’m buying a lottery ticket too. The 10-worder (celebrate, doctor, shipping, choice, stake, time flies when you're having fun, secrets, disaster, back down, clouds)I walked down the hallway to my doctor’s office. It looked to me like all of the doors were hiding secrets – secrets of pain and uncertainty. Or maybe that was just me. I waited forever for my examination. Grimly, I kept thinking, “time flies when you’re having fun.” Yeah right – this experience was the opposite of fun for me. When they finally called my name I glumly headed back to the inner sanctum.An hour and a half later I skipped back down that hallway, ready to celebrate. No more dark clouds. No more wondering if I would have to make a choice between different treatment plans. I know I was grinning like a loon, but given what had been at stake and the positive news I’d just received, I just couldn’t help it. Disaster averted. When I got home I busied myself shipping off my good news to the world wide web and then just let myself briefly travel back down the path of despair so I could fully appreciate my good fortune. And then I offered up a prayer of thanksgiving, and a prayer of hope for the ones who weren’t as lucky."},

I did some reading of a library book I downloaded onto my netbook.I'm sorry this picture isn't very clear – it was taken through the kitchen door which kept fogging up. But I really wanted to include a picture of Kung Fu Squirrel this week. Hi-Ya!Sunday, January 2nd We went on a ramble to see what was going on in the world. We tried to take pictures of some frozen ponds.Dr. M had to say a sad farewell to a bag of shredding that had been in his car for a month or more.While we were out we had this conversation. When we got home I decided to go for it & made my peanut butter, jelly, banana, ham & cheese sandwich. Wow it was good!Monday, January 3rdThe Tax Time Pig dressed for the new year.Dr. M took pictures of these geese flying. I could not decide which picture to use, so you get them all. I like the geometry of the pictures.Tuesday, January 4th As you can see, our bird feeder attracts an eclectic group.Every night when I get home, this sight greets me. He's sitting on our swing that we're storing in the garage for winter. He gives me the evil eye as I pull in. Today Dr. M had plugged him in so I laughed when I saw him.Here's a better picture that's not taken through my windshield.Wednesday, January 5thAnother squirrel picture – I just think they're so cute.It started snowing while I was at work. This is supposed to be a picture of me with snow in my hair. However, it just looks like I'm in a bad mood.Here's my car before I cleared the snow off - just a dusting.Thursday, January 6thOur bird bath cracked. Which is sad, but I love this icicle that formed from the crack.There are three birds in this picture, but only the cardinal isn't camouflaged.Friday, January 7thMore snow on Friday – Dr. M took this on his way home from school.Saturday, January 8thMore snow (more opportunities to grow!). Here are some indignant penguins – I have to cater to their wide internet following. Heh.Our neighbor loaned us his snow blower and Dr. M spent a while clearing our driveway, the neighbor's driveway, the sidewalk down the block & around the corner, and the sidewalk down the other direction from our house. He's such a good Samaritan.I had mentioned in an earlier post that I broke down & got a Kindle. So far my favorite feature is that you can increase the print size – don't need to wear my reading glasses to read it! I'll be doing a separate post later with my \"official review.\"As I am posting this at nearly 4:00 it's snowing again.

All I know is that it wasn’t white). I stood stock still and we eyed each other for a minute. Then it looked like he thought, “meh,” and turned to go away. That’s when I whipped out my camera to take a picture of him for my Project 365. All righty then – is this getting out of control?I had gotten some money for Christmas & I finally decided to get a Kindle. It came last night and I’ve already downloaded four (free) books. I think I’ll still enjoy reading real books more, but there are some situations that call for a Kindle. Like when you’re trying to eat your lunch & the fat paperback won’t stay propped open on the right page. Or when you’re going on vacation & you don’t want to lug four books with you. Or when you’re reading in bed at night & it’s easier to not have to flip pages (this is really the scenario that sold me). Anyway, the four books I downloaded are:Letters of Catherine Benincasa by Saint of Siena CatherineAgainst All Odds (Heroes of Quantico Series, Book 1) by Irene HannonInvisible (Ivy Malone Mystery Series #1) by Lorena McCourtneyThe Holy Bible English Standard Version (ESV) by a bunch of people and GodAs you can see, a bit of a variety. Keep in mind these were free – I’m going to try very hard to not just buy random books because it’s so easy. We’ll see how long I hold out. Yesterday I had the opportunity to practice my new attitude toward snow. It started snowing sometime around 4:00 & was coming down thick & heavy for a while. I left work a little early & started my trek home. And, really, the snow was not a problem. If I cursed at all, it was toward the other drivers who seemed inordinately cautious. Even then I told myself to calm down because their cars probably didn’t handle these conditions as well as my excellent car does. Talking to myself helped somewhat, but I’m glad no one was trying to take my blood pressure at the end of the drive. I am considering a poetry break. Some of you of you are saying, “Oh no!” Some of you are saying, “Thank God!” And some of you are saying, “She writes poetry?” But it’s just for a week or so. The Christmas season seemed to be packed with poetry, which was nice, but the brain needs replenishing. With the Heroes of Quantico and elderly ladies solving mysteries, apparently. However, if I can somehow match my epic poem, “Sally Jo’s Curtains,” (circa 1974) to a meme I will certainly post it. Oh, and Wordzzle’s are back – woo hoo!OK, enough rambling. You may now resume going about your business."},

It’s a good thing she learned to type all those years ago – she can do it with her eyes closed.

I need to remember that I am spoiled by the good life and that eating a soft pretzel with cheese is not the end of the known world. So, here are the things that I’m thankful for this week:Despite the fact that I should exercise some control, I do have a wide variety of food options available to me. I can afford them. They are safe to eat. And I have clean drinking water with which to wash them down.Dr. M, even when he makes me mad – I can’t even imagine life without him. He really bends over backward to make sure I have an easy life – who else would want to take on that job? Certainly not me!My friends and family and their generosity at Christmas. I should do actual thank you cards, but who knows if that will happen. So, Daddy & Amy, Joe & Bren & the kids, Kim, Jenny, Sherri, Barry & Sharon, Judy, the other Joe, Dr. M – thank you thank you thank you! I love all of you way more than a gift can show.I’m not a morning person, but even though I grumble a bit and whine, I have somewhere to go every day. I have a great job, and I get money for what I do. It’s great that it works out like that. Snow. Work with me here. I read this post by Lisa at Blessed yesterday & realized that the whining really should cease. I might need to work extra hard to be grateful for winter – but I know for sure that, when it comes, spring will not go unnoticed. So, go snow for making me appreciate the blessing of spring even more.That’s it, for today. I just put some drops in my eyes so maybe I can remove the toothpicks now.

As promised, I'm starting this week on Saturday, Christmas Day (although Dr. M snuck on here & posted a picture on Saturday last week). And I'm ending on Friday again – I want to start the new year fresh next week. Then I'll get back on track. Saturday, December 25th – Christmas Day!It started snowing Christmas morning, and by the time we left the nursing home after spending lunch with Dr. M's mom (who was thrilled to see him) this was what it looked like.That evening Daddy wanted me to take a picture of the mini pecan they found. They get these periodically & apparently they're perfectly formed & very tasty. And cute!Sunday, December 26thSo it just kept on snowing. No church for us today! I have a post showing some of the lovely snowy scenery here, but here are a couple of bird pictures. Daddy & Amy have a wealth of cardinals – it is the state bird of NC after all.And here is a blue jay who apparently has a taste for Old Roy dog food.Monday, December 27thLots of pictures today. We pass these flags when we go to the nursing home. I'd like to say that it's because the local high school mascot is the Rebels, but I'm sure we all know what they really mean. Sigh.Of course we have pictures of sheep – this time they're Lincoln County, NC sheep. I think they're well insulated from the snow!That evening we went to Dr. M's aunt & uncle's house for soup & sandwiches. Afterward Dr. M enjoyed her new recliner – it has a built-in massager.   Tuesday, December 28thDr. M took a picture of the sunrise on Tuesday.I went to lunch at Atlanta Bread Company with my cousin KJ. She didn't really want me to take her picture, but we Project 365ers are ruthless. Heh. We had a great time - & didn't nearly get done talking.I wanted evidence that I did eat something besides cake while we were in NC.   Wednesday, December 29thWe headed home on Wednesday. I had lost my sunglasses so we got new ones at a truck stop. I think I'm the stuff LOL.Here's part of our journey. We were joking that we weren't sure we'd make it up that snow covered road in the distance (click on the picture to make it larger). Don't worry – there's a tunnel. And we know that's not really a road :)Thursday, December 30thLaid back day of doing not much but laundry & putting away Christmas presents. I got Dr. M this sock monkey wine cover.Friday, December 31st – New Year's Eve! Today we went to Yellow Springs to eat lunch and wander around the shops. It's a nice little new age-ish kind of place. There's a clothing shop I told Dr. M he has to bring me back to when I lose 20 pounds. After that we went to the mall in Springfield to go to the Christopher & Banks (sweater sale!) and to get some calendars. No pictures of any of that. However, here is a clue to where we went next. What treat do you imagine we had?On our way out we saw this bush with a very content fluffed out bird ensconced. What a cutie.We will likely not stay up until midnight tonight – but we'll see. I have a book to read. Anything could happen! So once again I'll wish everyone a Happy New Year! I'll be documenting it again – can't wait to see what pictures we end up with!Go here to see the blogs of all the other Project 365 participants.Jeanne Iris is driving the bus this week & gave us three prompts.

I'm pretty sure my scale is insane – but it makes me happy anyway.After spending a week at my dad's house we are realizing just how small our place is. This is a blessing and a curse. I like that I don't have to walk very far from the washing machine to the closet. But there's nowhere for Dr. M to hide from me. Bwahahaha! I sat at my computer muttering to myself all morning (catching up on Quicken & bill paying does that to me) & he just had to sit there & take it. Wait - could this be the reason he's the Watering Man in the summer?I have turned into one of Those People. After all of my high finance, I needed to go to the bank and the post office. I bathed this morning, but to leave the house I just brushed my hair & headed out in my sweat pants. No makeup. No structured pants (really, it's not polite of me to go running around in sweat pants). I didn't go to Walmart, but I'm sure I would have had my picture taken for that website if I had. You know the one – where unsuspecting fashion morons are highlighted for all the world to see. I am a fashion moron. And you know? It's not really that I don't know what I look like. I just don't care. Wow – maybe I should make more of an effort just for Dr. M.

After 18 years of poems I guess it can be difficult to approach the subject in a new way. I'm still not sure what I think about it as a Christmas poem, but it's what came & it's what went out in our cards this year.  If you're feeling brave you can read the other 18 poems here. Dr. M wrote the ones where his name is listed first and I wrote the ones where mine is. Rebecca Jo at Knit By God's Hand gave me the idea for this poem in this post. It went in a different direction from what I thought when I started, but she got me started down this road. Stretch Out Your Hand Every day my head snaps backin surprise at evil.Like a child, wide-eyed and amazed,every time. Upheaval.I try to be cynical,to harden my heart.Jaundiced and jaded,impervious, apart.But, like a child, my head snaps backagain and againand again and I'm gasping for breathcalling your name.Lord God Jehovah.God of this morass.God of my tender heart.God of first and last.Hear my cry as my head snaps backfor the wounded worldand for the sometimes wounded meand sometimes hope tightly furled.Jesus said, \"Stretch out your hand.\"That withered hand made whole.Is that the answer then?Unfurl the hope and free the soul.And one more time my head snaps backas I realize the meaning -that I am not a mute observerwhile the world awaits its healing.Sing noel for Jesus has come!His outstretched hand touches mineand anoints my head and heart togo forth go forth this Christmastide!Dana and Mike RhyneChristmas 2010This poem is being posted as part of the early edition of One Shot Wednesday.

Additionally I seem to have some sort of sinus thing going on that makes me feel extra spacey (note the word “extra” – there’s usually some amount of spacey-ness in my head at all times). My poetry is vacuous (except for my Christmas poem, which is a sledge-hammer – just what everyone wants for Christmas) and my comments on posts are bleh and I should just quit writing altogether. Ha – you should be so lucky!I’m not writing this to garner compliments or sympathy – I would not believe you if you wrote them. I just need to write out the feeling in case that helps make it go away. Maybe in April – because if it’s the sinus thing I think that feeling is here to stay until they stop salting the roads up here. Here’s another very important issue going on right now: since I had my hair cut it doesn’t know where it lives anymore. On the right side of my head? On the left side? Mostly on one side or the other with some outliers straggling into my face? And what is the deal with these bangs?

The first one was to watch a piece of performance art that was pretty incredible. I recommend going to her site to watch it if you have time – it's about 10 minutes long. The second prompt was this picture of an Essence Vessel. An Essence Vessel is hollow, with a cork in the back. You are to put things inside it that contain your essence – \"a lock of hair, a song, or soil from where you were born.\" This second prompt is the one that inspired me. And when I was done, I read the thing & said, \"Hello College Dana!\" I think if we check carefully you'll see that she wrote this about 25 years ago & had it messengered to me here in the future.

Therefore I’ve been eating more than usual. Still not a ton, but I’m trying to eat an apple, a banana & a tangerine every day. At this rate I might actually get my USDA required gazillion servings of fruits & veggies a day! Why those sneaky WW people – getting me to eat healthy. Seven years ago when I was working the plan & hitting my goal I did it by eating a lot of salad & cookies. Now apparently I’m required to learn to eat like normal skinny people. What a concept! And why can’t I do that without paying someone money? I just can’t. Stop making me psychoanalyze myself people – sheesh! I’m not Reya (although I wish I could be just a tiny bit like her).Speaking of psychoanalyzing, I was going to write a poem today about how I miss my mom a lot at Christmas. As I wrote on Ruth’s blog this morning: If your mother was a Christmas lullaby then mine was the raucous spitting image of Christmas Present from the Scrooge tale - my goodness did she love to celebrate Christmas WIDE OPEN and with an embarrassment of gifts under the tree (I never minded). And the food! Christmas has never been the same since she left us - a little more contemplative maybe, but less outrageously joyous. But I don’t think I want to go there today. There are seeds of something to write – perhaps about how contemplative is better now that I’m older. I’ll admit – my mother’s Christmases were exhausting! Sunday night I realized that I had created a tag called “complaining” but I don’t remember creating it. So now I have to go back through my posts & tag all the ones where I’m complaining. That could take a while, don’t you think? But note: I’m not really complaining in this post, am I. I’m being thoughtful & rejoicing over fruit. Go me!"},

That Tanya Tucker sings a whale of an Away in the Manger by the way. And I don’t know why, but EVERY TIME I hear the Amy Grant Emmanuel/Little Town/Christmas Hymn suite I just want to bawl. It’s just so beautiful to me. • I love how Dr. M’s mother is always so thrilled to see him. You can tell she thinks he’s the bees knees. • I humiliated myself at the family Thanksgiving dinner and it’s Amy’s fault. She made me sing the Barbara Streisand version of the Lord’s Prayer (I was joking & said that we should sing that before the meal instead of having another prayer). Daddy helped, but it was NOT pretty. Oh well, I’m sure that will be the end of requests like that. On the other hand, the poem was well-received. Stick with what you’re good at Bug!• Speaking of poems, one or the other of us (speaking to Dr. M here) needs to write our annual Christmas poem. We’re even (9 each), so it doesn’t matter which of us does the deed. We’ll see if the muse strikes sometime in the next couple of weeks.• I’ve just been given a mission to find film for a Polaroid camera. The chickie (seriously – she’s probably 18) at the local Walgreens had NO IDEA what I was talking about. Then she pretended to go check & came back & said she was sorry she didn’t have anything that old. Ouch!• Well, lunch is almost over – better get this posted.

I'll still monitor things while I'm gone, but I wanted to get this post out there] As this is my first time driving the Poetry Bus I have to warn you that some of my friends consider me to be an unsafe driver. I disagree. I don't believe that trying to determine the exact moment when it's best to accelerate in a curve is unsafe. Exactly. In any case I will take extra care with TFE's fabulous bus. I won't go over 70 mph (128 km/h). Honest. One of the reasons I haven't driven before now is that coming up with prompts is hard. And in fact, as I give you these three choices I'm not even sure that I'll be able to come up with a poem for any of them. But most of you have been at this Poetry Bus thing a lot longer than me, so I'm sure you'll have no trouble at all. So, pick one of the prompts below & have at it!In the first chapter of Isaiah God is having a fit. Quit giving me burnt offerings! Stop trampling my courts! Why do you even think I want that stuff? I am weary of bearing them… Wash yourselves! And then in verse 18 God says, \"Come now, let us argue it out…\" (NRSV) Now, you might not be a religious person, but I'm sure that even so you have wanted to argue with God (or Allah or the sun or your own super ego) in some manner. If you choose this prompt I'd like you to tell us about that argument.In the movie, The Hunt for Red October, Sam Neill (swoon) plays a defecting submarine officer. During a quiet moment in the film he tells Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin) that he has always dreamed of living in Montana. SPOILER ALERT FOR A TWENTY YEAR OLD FILM!

Really!Words for the mini: thank, teacher, movies, unleash, lamp shadeThere's a lamp shade in the middle of the floor. Why? I almost trip over it in my haste to get to the movies on time. As I carefully walk around it (why should I bother to put it back on the lamp?) I remember – oh! It's to remind me to write that thank you note to my teacher! I ignore lists, and to keep from unleashing the wrath of my grandmother's spirit I've resorted to drastic measures to help me remember basic courtesies. Sitting down at my desk, I take out a pen and a notecard. I'll be late for the movie, but I'll be able to put the lamp shade back on the lamp & that will be much safer for when I return in the dark!Words for this week's 10-word challenge:  career, incense, prosperity, chloroform, cane, electrical outlet, preponderance, salivate, chopped liver, pillows  I was propped up on about five pillows and gazing at the tray my \"host\" (Mr. Evil Kidnapping Man) had brought for my dinner. The sight of the chopped liver caused me to salivate. Which must have been a side effect of the chloroform because I hate liver. Blech. Although I had no idea how long I had been unconscious, so I was probably fairly hungry. I guess it's true that you will eat anything if you're hungry enough. After EKM had taken the tray away I assessed my situation. I remembered leaning over to pick up the walking cane that had fallen into the pathway, and as I handed it back to EKM he put out his hand and my world went dark. I awoke in this bare room with a preponderance of totally empty walls. There wasn't even an electrical outlet. I caught the faint odor of ancient incense and wondered if I had been taken to the old monastery. My recent career change had brought new prosperity to my life. Apparently I was either being admonished that I should live more simply, or I was going to pay out some of that new prosperity so that EKM could live less simply. Time would tell."},

The problem wasn’t the stuffy atmosphere – it was the overt virility of her dinner companion. That, plus the restaurant’s name was so obvious. The tension was just about more than she could handle. Her martini hadn’t slowed her galloping imagination one iota. Staring out the window she could see the roiling ocean echoing her agitation. Finally, she could stand it no more and burst out laughing. Jack tried to look offended but manly, and that made her laugh even harder. “I’m sorry Jack,” she choked out, preparing to bolt from the room, “I just don’t think this is going to work.” Well, at least maybe this fiasco would stop her mother from setting her up again.

I’m not very good at lists – I get all annoyed that someone (me!) is telling me what to do & I ignore it.2. If so, what is at the top? If I had a list I think that travelling “out west” somewhere might be on top. Mount Rushmore, Grand Canyon, the Redwood forest…3. What news story stood out from those you heard today? The story that grabbed me was the one in our local paper about how the Board of Elections was staying open later for early voting. I’m going tonight! I’m really thankful that our local republican committee sent a postcard listing all their candidates. I can take it with me & then vote for the other people. Heh.4. What are you most thankful for this year? That Dr. M & I have jobs. That we’re (relatively) healthy.5. What small thing always makes you happy? Using our back scratcher when I have an itch on my back. Ahhhh…6. What is your favorite old movie? This is tough! But right now, with mid-term elections next week, I’m going with Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.7. Was there a surprise in your day? I tackled a dreaded task & not only did I complete it, it ended up not being as hard as I thought it would be. I was taking a complicated spreadsheet of information and making a streamlined powerpoint presentation from the data. Blech. But I think it turned out just fine.Now I am supposed to come up with seven different questions and tag seven people, which I always hate doing. And you are not obligated to participate - & if you want to just answer the questions & not pass it along that’s fine too. And if I don't tag you, you can grab the questions and play along, or answer them in the comments! [Note: I mostly copied this straight from Rita’s blog because she said what I thought!]OK, here are my questions for you:1. What do you consider your hometown to be?2. What’s the hardest part of your average day?3. The easiest? Why?4. What beverage do you reach for to quench your thirst?5. What is one not-so-secret goal you have for your life? I’ll let you keep your secret ones to yourself.6. What physical pain do you fear most? For example, I’m trying to decide how bad my jaw pain needs to get before I risk a potential needle from my dentist. So, for me, throbbing is preferable to jabbing.7. Where do you find solace?I’m tagging the following folks:Kim at Prayers for the Oft Traveled RoadKaty at What a Great Place to be a CowAnne at reverent irreverenceCarolina Linthead at Child of a Frosty MorningBekah at Reflections…on Living CreativelyJayne at Journey Through GraceBella Rum at Cul-de-sac Chronicles"},
{"title": "Brought Up Short", "date": "Tuesday, October 26, 2010", "text": "On Facebook today I laughed at some commentary about a picture of a local candidate who looked pretty scary in a TV debate. It was easy to do because I am her polar political opposite and would love to see her defeated at the polls because of her policies. But someone chimed in and commented that here we go again talking first about how a woman looks and then about her politics. Someone else made a crack about how John Boehner is pretty scary looking too. However, the comment made me uncomfortable. Isn't it lovely & delicious to see our adversary looking bad? Doesn't it seem fitting, & isn't it the most natural thing to ridicule her in that moment? Wow – that thought totally brought me up short. And made me glad that I don't have thousands of people tracking my every good and bad hair day. And it made me wish that we never even got to see what our political candidates look like. Why should that matter at all when I go to the polls? For me it doesn't matter – I vote my conscience. But I'm sure there are people who, perhaps even subconsciously, vote for the pretty person. And it was one of the reasons I was so sad to find out that John Edwards wasn't who he appeared to be.I was going to grab that picture from Facebook to add to my post. But the thread isn't there anymore. I guess the person who posted it was just as uncomfortable as I was, in the end. Thank goodness."},

Although she knew what it was, Lisa dreamed of a long distance lover writing to say he was going to parachute in to save her sanity. For a moment the sheer hunger to escape immobilized her. Lisa opened the envelope, which her mother had already used as a scratch pad – grocery list, apparently: bananas, apples, cereal… There was one sheet of paper inside. Dear Ms. Jessamine, Your submission was lovely. We especially liked the verse about the red-headed woman speaking into a microphone about sandhill cranes. However, we received over 900 entries. The judges had a difficult time choosing the winner from so many lovely poems. I regret to say that your entry was not selected…Well, at least she got a letter this time. Lisa wondered if she would have won if the poem had been about a whooping crane instead.Words for the mini: popular, pregnant, turtle, basket, presentTurtle Bay was the most popular restaurant in town. Alma was beside herself with glee as the waiter (his name was Lorenzo – Alma always made a point of asking) placed the bread basket on the table. This was going to be the best birthday present ever. At least she assumed it was a birthday present. Ted hadn’t mentioned her birthday yet. Maybe he’d give her a ring & wouldn’t that be the best birthday present ever! Alma wiggled anticipatorily in her seat. Ted thought Alma seemed extra bouncy tonight. He wished she were more subdued – he always wished she were more subdued. He had no idea what had her so excited. Maybe it was something to do with work. In any case, it was going to make his job a little more difficult. Not that telling your girlfriend you were breaking up because you’d gotten the new love of your life pregnant was ever a walk in the park.Lorenzo watched the couple at table 8. Reading the signs as he always did, he wondered if the woman would scream & dump the wine on the twit who was dumping her, or if she would dissolve in tears. Or maybe she’d be civilized about it. He was about to start the betting pool when he heard the first shriek & crash. Ah – his favorite response! She might need some consoling – the Lorenzo treatment – after the theatrics were over.Go to Raven’s blog to read the other entries. And join in - it's a lot of fun, really!"},

I'm always in too big a hurry to stop to take pictures. Oh, and WARNING WILL ROBINSON – there are a lot of pictures this week. It's just too gorgeous around here & I had a hard time picking!If that sounds familiar it's because it's exactly what I said last week – except that this week I actually stopped to take a few pictures.Sunday, October 17thDr. M took a picture of this robin that sat very properly on the birdbath for a while.And then he went to town – splish splash he was takin' a bath!Later that afternoon we played bocce for a while. Our yard is a bit on the uneven & concrete-ish side, so instead of a game of skill it was a game of chance. The boy from next door decided that he wanted to try.That is until the ice cream truck came by. It was funny – I was just trying to get a picture of the truck & here comes A barreling down the driveway to get his popsicle. Monday, October 18thThese days it's dark when Dr. M gets to school, so he often catches the campus herd in action.On his way home he took a picture of one of my favorite houses in Yellow Springs – fall is when it shines the most – fits right in with all the foliage.Tuesday, October 19thI love this picture of a squirrel on Dr. M's campus! It's just doing what squirrels are supposed to do this time of year.Dr. M also took some pictures of seasonal decorations – and some really lovely flowers.These trees are on the street behind our house.Wednesday, October 20thLook! I took some pictures! Here is the Tax Time Pig – no longer a red devil. I think he's a ninja pumpkin this week. If you look in the background you can see that they've dressed their goose up for Halloween too.When I left for lunch a medical helicopter was taking off from the lawn in front of my building – they use it because it's so wide & flat (remind me to take a picture of the lawn sometime!). In my effort to capture the helicopter (it's just in the top of the tree at the bottom of the picture) I got this great sun shot. Now this is the type of accidental photo I like!Dr. M took a ton of pictures of the fall foliage this week – it was so hard for me to pick just a few! To see a couple of others check out yesterday's post.Thursday, October 21stDr. M was finally able to get a good picture of the ducks at this dam – the traffic is usually too bad for him to be able to stop there.Here are a couple of pictures just to remind everyone of where we live.Seasonal decorations – love how the pumpkins look with the wagon.Friday, October 22ndDr. M was drawn to the moon on Friday – here it is on his way to school. Love the low lying fog & how the frost makes it look like there's snow on the ground.On his way home he took a picture of the river he crosses.And here is the evening moon, taken from our yard.Saturday, October 23rdDr. M got up at a ridiculous hour of the morning, as usual, and took yet another moon picture – I thought this one was really Halloweeny through the trees.Here are our window decorations. We have two neighbors who take this holiday seriously, so we try to keep up appearances at our house in our own understated way. Yes, this is understated.When I finally rousted myself out of bed I took a picture of our door decoration (I’m sitting on the floor, which is why he seems to be looming over me). We've just named him frankencrow because last year's hot sun caused him to start falling apart (the disadvantage of glue, I guess), so he's pinned together using various implements.

I must admit, ahem, that I'm a little more tender hearted than usual this week. But. Goodness! I had to redo my makeup at the stoplights like those women who put on their faces on the way to work every day. How do they DO that?I'm listening to The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins. It's the first book in a series of three. I've been warned that book two contains even more crying. I don't usually pick books for their ability to wring out my emotions – I'm more into the escape thing – and I might not have started reading this one had I known. But it's really really good. I'm not done yet, so if you've read it I don't want to hear any details – la la la la I can't hear you!It's not just been this book that has opened my floodgates. I couldn't even think about the Chilean miners without crying. And this story about the teenager with Down Syndrome who got a touchdown in his high school football game (I read about it on JennyMac's blog). I'm just a regular fountain these days. My boss thinks my allergies are really bad.I'm not a person who typically cries a lot. But I will let go when I read something touching or watch a tender vittles moment in a movie (or a Hallmark commercial). I've often thought it was my way of letting it all out in a safe way – where I don't have to examine my feelings too closely. So what's going on inside my heart these days? Lots of stuff I of course don't want to confront – but the biggest thing & the one that makes it harder to take the other stuff is that despite its beauty, fall makes me very sad. Winter's a comin'.

I spent the weekend in a veritable writing frenzy – producing three stellar pieces of word art (four, if you count the limerick). And here I go again with the writing. I do believe this blogging business really is an addiction. But I can quit any time. Really.Anyway, when I wasn’t writing yesterday I was studying the passage I’m responsible for at our Bible study tomorrow night, Joel 2:23-31. This section has one of my favorite passages in the Bible, but first I’d like to point out the irony of verse 23:Be glad, O people of Zion, rejoice in the LORD your God, for he has given you the autumn rains in righteousness. [e] He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains…Hmm – I was all prepared to talk about how parched we’ve been, but weather.com indicates that in September we had just under the average rainfall (although my dad’s area in NC had about half of its average rainfall). So maybe we’re always draughtish in fall. But, with the exception of a couple of good rains, we have seen no abundant showers here in middle Ohio. I know, I know – every year is different & blah blah this & that. I was just amused to read about all this abundance last night after we’d tried playing bocce on the concrete slab disguised as our lawn.OK, enough about the non-irony. Here’s the passage I love, verse 28:I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.So, Spirit for all! Sons & daughters even! Why, I do believe that daughters are women – are you listening Southern Baptist Church? Hmm? It goes on to say, “Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days.” Oh for heaven’s sake – I’m sure that there’s no one reading my blog (among those who believe that there is a God) who would disagree that women can’t have God’s spirit. There’s just this debate about what they’re allowed to do with it.I really did not plan to go down this path today – mostly because as far as I can tell it’s more of a meander full of those cocklebur things that stick to your pants & then you spend a half an hour afterward pulling them off. This is what happens when you leave your mind to its own devices. Isn’t there a meme I can do tomorrow – just to keep me on more manicured paths?"},

The Magpie prompt, as usual, is a picture (see below). The bus prompt, given by the science lady herself, NanU, is thus: For this week's Bus ride, instead of suggesting a topic to write about, I'd like us to change the poem-writing environment. Write your poem in a place and time and circumstances that break with your usual thing. I didn't see any reason why that wasn't doable. However. The attempt with an actual pen and actual paper in the bedroom on Friday night was a bust. And just now (sadly, not a different time at all), in the yard with my netbook was not much better. In fact, this is my first attempt – which had nothing to do with the Magpie:I sat in the yard on a SundayNo it could not wait until MondayI thought and I thoughtAnd it all came to naughtMy poem for the bus still a \"someday.\"But I persevered. I sat and stared at clouds. And birds. And bees (which did not produce any verses about safe sex). I talked with the neighbors and watched Dr. M put away the bocce set.

The words for the mini: ink, cool whip, every cloud has a silver lining, static, platform  Jayne was trying to decide whether to get some new ink. She really liked her other tattoo – a broken heart symbol. It was a perverse comfort to her when Jacob left her. Every time she caught a glimpse of it in the mirror it reminded her to watch her step. She was watching her step now – strolling along in her platform wedges she felt cool as Cool Whip. But she remembered what it felt like to fall. The problem was, tattoos were such a static art form. You couldn't exactly redecorate when you were bored with them. But, still, she was very tempted to add a new one to commemorate her new love & her new motto: every cloud has a silver lining. Words for this week's 10-word challenge: chilled to the bone, market, back to work, floating, lynx, glutted, shelter, garage sale, honey, marginal   I know I should be glad to be back to work. Even if it's a floating shift. In a department with marginal bonus potential. In an industry that has already glutted the market. The negative self talk is not helping here. Glad glad glad glad – if I say it often enough will I really mean it? Did I want to lose my home & have to live in a shelter? Did I want to sell all my worldly possessions for $1 each at a garage sale? I should be chilled to the bone just contemplating how close I came to utter disaster.

It was so hot on Sunday. Here's one of the shows they watched.And a picture of Dr. M as they were leaving. They were late getting to the Mudde Show & had to sit too close to the front. I was highly amused when he got home & had mud all over his costume. Monday, October 11thOn Monday I had the day off from work & did laundry. Our washer will hold two loads of towels, but not the dryer. So while one set dried inside, the other set dried outside. It was so warm again that they dried in about 2 hours.Dr. M still had to go to school & took these gorgeous pictures on his way.Here is a tree on his campus.I took this picture of the tree over the fence in our back yard.And, lastly, that evening I took a picture of one of our banana pepper plants – still going strong.Tuesday, October 12thJust one picture from Tuesday, taken by Dr. M – another beautiful tree.Wednesday, October 13thOn Wednesday I did some drive by shooting. Inexplicably, the sheep farm I pass now has a ginormous bull in their front yard. I'm not sure what it means, but I knew I had to take a picture of it.This is just a random shot of some of the trees on my way home. I like the understated color of the trees & the sky above them.Dr. M had took this picture of a field of flowers – such a nice contrast with the rest of the fall landscape.Speaking of – another fabulous tree!Thursday, October 14thMore gorgeous fall pictures from Dr. M – and another shot of our town (apparently it's the new thing to do on Thursdays – we had almost the same picture last Thursday)Friday, October 15thThis made me laugh so I had to post it. I could never get myself to work early enough this week so I couldn't get a picture of the Tax Time Pig. And I didn't get one this day either LOL. So much for point & shoot. It's dressed as a red devil this week. (Click on the picture to enlarge it & read my little message).Dr. M got some actual pictures – we've been fascinated by the corn for some reason. I love this picture of the flower & the ear of corn.I wonder where this corn will go? Saturday, October 16thWell, it's not summer any more. We had our first frost, & are now afraid for our tomatoes. Although, you know, it is October, so I think we should be able to let them go. This is ice in the bird bath. So we started the week sweltering & ended it with frost.

I’d like to blame lack of sleep, but actually 7 ½ hours should be enough, don’t you think? I would have gone to bed earlier but I’m taking an antibiotic for a potential abscessed tooth & I have to stay up until 10:30 to take the 3rd dose of the day. Now that both of my teams are out of the playoffs I’m ready to start going to bed at 9:00 each night.Speaking of baseball, I read that when the Texas Ranger’s won their division series, Josh Hamilton’s teammates doused him with ginger ale instead of champagne. He’s a recovering addict & I love that they wanted him to participate. He sat out the last celebration so he wouldn’t be tempted – left, in fact, to go talk to a church group. But this time they wanted to include him so they broke out the Ginger Ale - & waited until he left to start the usual champagne & beer-fest. Very cool. Here’s another baseball gem. I have a problem with praying for victory in sports events – or with attributing victory to God. What does that say about the other team? Are they Godless? Does God hate them? Or our team if we lose? Apparently, Bobby Knight, appearing at a luncheon at Southern Methodist University, agrees – and if you think I lightly mention that Bobby Knight & I agree on something you are surely mistaken. He’s the kind of basketball coach I love to hate. Anyway, here is the info from Big League Stew (where I get all of my baseball news), quoting the Dallas Morning News: Knight jumped in before his speech officially started — heck, before lunch was even served — after the Rangers' series win over Tampa Bay was mentioned in the benediction.\"I think Cliff Lee had a hell of a lot more to do with it than the Almighty,\" Knight said, after grabbing the microphone at the podium unexpectedly. \"If in fact the Almighty was involved in the game, what he ended up doing was screwing the other team. And I don't think he works that way.\"You've got to get up there and throw the ball over the plate and swing at good pitches. You know, He doesn't give a damn about that. Let him help the Republicans.\"Let him help the Republicans. Oh that just made me laugh loud & long when I read it this morning. I do believe in separation of church and state, but goodness, I think all three parties (Republican, Democrat & Tea) could use a bit of help from God.

We had to be there bright & early (9:30 – that's early for me on a Saturday – since it's an hour away) because each school organization was supposed to have a table at a \"carnival.\" Unfortunately, most of the history club members are in the band, so that left Dr. M (& me!) to operate their game. We had bocce ball – those who got closest to the yellow ball got some candy.Here's Dr. M showing off his form.This guy was so funny! His game was to have people throw tennis balls at bottles on his table. I threw the ball under the table. He had pity on me & gave me a piece of candy anyway.One last shot – the cheerleaders changed into these fun outfits for the halftime show. I want some socks like that!P.S. It was SO HOT today! I got sunburned because I wasn't prepared, which is silly because you can get burned even if the temperature is cooler, so I should have used sunscreen regardless. But, on the plus side we actually won the football game!Go here to see the blogs of all the other Project 365 participants."},

Here's the Wikipedia entry for other folks who might be in the dark!Head over to Raven's place to read some other Wordzzles – I know I say it every week, but you won't be disappointed. I think we have some talented writers on this team! All right, I'm shutting up now. Read!Words for the mini: I-pad, Chinese whispers, CD, sparkling, cat foodPenny needed this moment after her trip to the store – purchasing cat food & the new Mary-Chapin Carpenter CD shouldn't have been so stressful, but she didn't really do people these days. Who was she kidding? She had never been comfortable with the shopping hoards. And she was already regretting the CD purchase. If she kept impulse buying she'd never be able to afford an I-pad. Sigh. She stopped the car and got out. The sea was sparkling, the wind whipping about her head sounding for all the world like that game \"Chinese Whispers.\" Penny wondered if what she heard in the wind was a great truth or only a distortion of the meaning of life. Regardless, the susurration was soothing and calmed her nerves. Getting back into her car her thoughts turned to those hungry cats & her own dinner. Quickly, she unwrapped the new CD – might as well enjoy her new purchase anyway.Words for the 10-worder: talented, oak, speaker, junk, wrapper, pencil, ocean, chatter, bullet, steamyAs the bullet entered its target, John watched the guy next to him write in a small notebook with a pencil. Why a pencil? Seemed like he must be insecure to record his thoughts in an erasable medium. Pulled out of his reverie, John realized that someone was trying to get his attention. He couldn't hear the speaker over his ear protection and the chatter of the other guns so he motioned him over to an oak tree set apart from the firing range. As he went along he picked up some of the junk on the ground – gum wrappers and shell casings, mostly. He started to work up a rant in his head about litterers, but ran out of interest pretty quickly. The steamy day didn't really lend itself to soapboxes. Under the tree he finally got a good look at his visitor and then groaned. Bad enough he kept getting calls at home, but now they were stalking him in person. There was an ocean of more handsome & talented men out there – why were they after him? Shaking his head, he said, \"No, as I told you the first three times you asked, I am not interested in being a part of your Hunks with Guns nudie calendar! \""},

Well, I didn't really comply with the directions, but I hope she'll let me lash myself to the roof of the bus anyway! The story I picked isn't small exactly – although if we think in international terms it might be. You can read the article here, but the gist of it is that a thirty-something young woman has been arrested for pretending to be a 14 year old boy in order to \"lure\" teenage girls into a sexual relationship. After reading a few other articles I'm not sure about her culpability – perhaps the teenage girl wasn't as in the dark as she is being portrayed. I don't know, really, but this story seems to have a great many sides, some of which remind me of Salem, a bit. Anyway, here's what came out of my head after I put the article in it.IncompleteIt's lies & intrigueIf they only knewThat black holeIn my heartIt's complicatedThis illicit or innocentLonging forRelationshipIt's weary-makingWhich mask is More trueLess meIt's my soulStripped bare My lightless heartYour judgment"},
{"title": "Random Dozen", "date": "Wednesday, October 6, 2010", "text": "After quite a long absence (well, to be fair, Lid took the summer off) I decided to participate in the Random Dozen again. This week she asked her readers to give her questions to ask – so that she could have her birthday off from making these difficult decisions. I must say that they did a great job. If you'd like to see other answers to the questions, check out Linda's 2nd Cup of Coffee blog here.1. From \"Men Are Dumb ....\": If you had a theme song that played whenever you walked into a room full of people, what would it be? I Like Big Butts, by Sir Mix-A-Lot. It's not a song that I really know, but it's the one that popped immediately into my head, & I can only hope that people are thinking it when I enter a room LOL! I was going to post a link to the video, but decided that my blog is a little too family friendly. Feel free to google if you're curious!2. From Pam of \"Alert And Oriented x 4\": Which of your shoes are your absolute favorite, and which are of the object of your most painful shoe-buyer's remorse?Which is which? You be the judge! And if you wear a size 6.5 US women's and just have to have them, I will gladly ship the gold ones to you.3. From Susanne of \"Living to Tell the Story\": Tell about your favorite birthday celebration that you've personally experienced. I think I've mentioned this on my blog before, but for my 30th birthday my mom sent me a gift a day for 30 days. Sometimes it was big (a new outfit), sometimes it was small (a candy bar). It was the highlight of my day for those 30 days. And really brought home how old I was LOL. Of course, 16 years later…4. From Lori of \"Just me and My Life\": If you were a flavor of ice cream, which would you be? Ben & Jerry's Phish Food! I've eaten enough of it that I'm probably Phish Food already. That's not really a good thing is it? 5. Cindy Swanson of \"Notes in the Key of Life\" asks: Have you ever had a crush on a movie star? Who was it, and are you still crushing? Gary Sinise, from when he was in The Stand. Sigh. But our politics are not even in the same universe so I had to let him go. 6. Jill from \"Jill Boyd's Place\" inquires: Glasses or braces--if you had to wear one, which would it be? Having had both I would have to say glasses. Even though I hate to wear glasses, the three years I wore braces are not remembered fondly. Not. At. All.7. Nel from \"Fasteneau Facts\" asks: If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be? Right now it would probably be Burke County, North Carolina. Near the mountains, near our parents, still pretty rural (I think!). 8. Thena from \"Patiently Waiting\" wants to know: If money were no obstacle, what would be the perfect birthday gift to receive? That's easy – a hybrid vehicle of some kind. My long time crush has been a Toyota Prius, but who knows? By the time someone actually gives me a car like that almost any car company could have the best hybrid.9. From \"Life Through Bifocals,\" LynnMarie asks: What is your favorite birthday meal? Bakery cake (no whipped frosting – that's not frosting!). That's all. I don't need real food on my birthday.10. Debby at \"Just Breathe\" checks in with: Do you still send hand-written thank you notes? Still? That implies that I ever did. I am a terrible southerner! Just the other day I got the sweetest note from Amy thanking me for her birthday earrings (her birthday was during my slight blog break – happy late birthday Amy!). I had two thoughts when I got the note: 1. Oh how nice! 2. Guess it's a good thing I didn't keep the earrings for myself. Heh.11. Linda from \"Mocha with Linda\" poses this question: What is something you've done that you never thought you'd do? Hmm. I'm not usually very surprised by myself. I could say live in Africa for a year and a half, but really that didn't surprise me. I know! I joined the Episcopal Church after we moved to Ohio. I hadn't thought about it very much, but I always assumed I'd be a Southern Baptist forever. But the Episcopal Church seemed to be a place of welcome instead of a place of condemnation (sorry – that's how I felt about the Southern Baptist Convention at the time). 12. Jewel, my homegirl from Indiana who writes at \"Musings from the World of Jewel,\" is very insistent that we answer this: Mount Rushmore honors four US Presidents: Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt. If you could add any person to Mount Rushmore, who would you add and why? Any person? Why, Ben Franklin of course! I don't want to hear any historical mumbo jumbo about the reality of the man – his myth is larger than life & twice as fascinating. And he would certainly liven up the party!"},
{"title": "Oh Sweet October Madness", "date": "Tuesday, October 5, 2010", "text": "I’m sure by now you might know that I am a baseball fan. Not a fanatic (I actually can’t name all the players in the infield – or the outfield – of the teams I follow). But not a casual fan either – if our teams are playing & if Fox Sports doesn’t screw us (strong, but accurate, language), we’re watching the games. When Dr. M & I were first married we lived in a house owned by an orthdontia practice. We lived in two rooms on the top floor of the house & were responsible for mowing & cleaning. It was a sweet deal, although now I can’t really believe that we lived for a while basically in our bedroom (the other room we used for storage). We did have the use of the kitchen.Anyway, the spring after we were married we watched a LOT of baseball in our one habitable room (that was the time when I completed that insanely large stained glass window jigsaw puzzle N gave us – I hold him personally responsible for any current twitchiness). Coindentally, that year (1991) our Atlanta Braves went from the worst team in baseball to the first team. I thought that was an auspicious beginning to our marriage. That was the beginning of a pretty successful run for the Braves. Fourteen consecutive division titles (we shall not mention the strike year). Going to the World Series five times and winning once. Those were halcyon days. However, for a number of years now we’ve watched our Braves not quite (or even not even close) get ‘er done. Year after year Dr. M & I have spend the post season just basically pulling for whoever could maybe beat the Yankees* or Boston. And our adopted team, the Cincinnati Reds? Not a pretty picture in oh so many years. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿But this year we have an embarassment of riches. The Braves and the Reds are in the post season, which starts tomorrow. Fortunately they don’t play each other right away so we can pull for both for a little while longer. What I’m hoping for is a Braves/Rays World Series. It could happen! If the Braves get their act together. Really!﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew﻿ http://projects.ajc.com/gallery/view/sports/braves/phillies-braves-100310/﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿  *Uncle David, I would apologize for the slight to the Yankees, but they are an evil big business machine & I’m not sure how a Democrat could pull for them. Of course, that’s assuming you’re a Democrat. Do I even know you?﻿﻿"},

{"title": "Weekly Wordzzle", "date": "Friday, October 1, 2010", "text": "It's Wordzzle time again! This week I decided to do all three challenges, but the last one is perhaps my lamest attempt ever. Perhaps. At least I've finished the mini story. You can read the other two bits here and here.Go to Raven's blog here to read the other stories – we have some excellent writers participating (and, you know, you too could be one of those writers – you know you want to, & it's addicting!)Words for the mini: march, bald headed man, bones, photo album, mail boxPhyllis flipped through the photo album before she put it in a box. Why had she saved the picture of that bald headed man? At the time she thought he looked like Yul Brynner, but now she can't really see the resemblance. She needed to quit going through every blessed thing or she'd never finish packing. She put herself on autopilot – and then smiled as thoughts of her conversation with Bill started to march through her head. She'd told him that she'd been accepted to a graduate program in Massachusetts and that she'd be moving at the end of this month. And she'd tried to break up with him – knowing that the distance would drain all the life out of their relationship, just leaving bare bones. He had said she was being a dramatic ninny & unless she had some other reason to break up with him she was stuck with him. He figured there were jobs & bars with dart boards in Boston too. Ever since she had received the acceptance in her mail box she had agonized over leaving Cincinnati, and leaving Bill. Apparently her mother had been right after all – don't borrow trouble. Stop worrying and just maybe you'll have a pleasant surprise. Words for the 10-word challenge: church, tongue in cheek, butterflies, charcoal, neurotic, save our schools, candles, solitaire, matches, chatter boxKaren tried to tamp down the butterflies in her stomach. Even though she had left her usual neurotic hour early she was running late. How was she to know that there'd be a \"Save Our Schools\" rally on Church Street? Now her charcoal gray suit had dark splotches under the armpits. Couldn't be helped – but the dampness wouldn't inspire confidence in her new clients. Oh lord what were their names? David & Janice? Brent & Sandra? Ken & Barbie? Her brain was such a chatter box that she wouldn't hear the answer even if she remembered it. \"Calm down Karen, deep breaths, it'll come to you…\" Oh yes – James and Theresa! Whew! After spending the appropriate amount of time admiring Theresa's diamond solitaire, Karen got right down to business and spent the next hour talking about unity candles and whether or not boxes of matches with their names and the wedding date would be good favors. Karen mentioned having been at a wedding once where one of the flower arrangements on a table at the reception had caught fire. Perhaps, she suggested tongue in cheek, they should give away mini fire extinguishers instead. James and Theresa thought that was a grand idea, which left Karen with the job of searching for cute fire extinguishers in the bride's colors. Apparently her brain wasn't the only chatter box – she needed to muzzle her mouth too!Words for the mega: church, tongue in cheek, butterflies, charcoal, neurotic, save our schools, candles, solitaire, matches, chatter box, march, bald headed man, bones, photo album, mail boxI am going to march right into that church and light a few candles for my mother. I don't care if I'm Catholic or not – it couldn't hurt. All right, where are the matches? I see the bones of a bunch of used matches, but not any fresh ones. Oh well, I'll just sit in a pew and pray. After a few minutes I notice that a bald headed man has interrupted my reverie. He had apparently noticed that I was playing one handed solitaire (shuffling is loud in church). With my usual irreverence, I make a tongue in cheek joke at my own expense. I can be quite a chatter box when I'm embarrassed. But before I can ask him where the matches are his charcoal eyes look deep into mine and he tells me to be quiet. I'm nervous about this, all my neurotic tendencies can be easily seen in my eyes – not just a window into my present soul, my eyes are a photo album, showing my past as well. What would he see in them? Finally, he speaks. \"Save our schools! You should receive a flyer in your mail box, but you can work to save them now!\" All my nervous butterflies disappear in a wave of hysterical laughter. All righty then – perhaps I'll just stick to the Baptist way of mourning the dead, which I think involves more chocolate and less fruitcake."},

And since you’re reading this I must have decided to hit “publish post.” Sorry!I’m sitting at my desk at work (having worked very hard this morning if you must know) watching the flags flying outside. I can see our flags (US, Ohio & the company flag – really? The company needs a flag? It’s not our company – it’s the one that owns the building) and I can see the flags of the building next door – same drill, except they have a different company flag. The sky is really blue. The trees in the parking lot haven’t changed colors yet.I can smell the banana on my desk (a bad sign – it’s one whiff away from being too ripe for me to enjoy it). I can hear…silence & then tapping keys. My office is really quiet, which I guess would drive some people crazy, but I like it. I don’t even want music playing most of the time – too much constant ear traffic tends to roar in my brain & I can’t hear myself think. And, really, I need all the help I can get in that department. I can taste the pasta I had for lunch – pretty yummy, but that was 2 hours ago. Hmm – perhaps a Listerine breath strip is in order. Yes, that’s better – not yummy, but not leftover lunch either.I can feel that twinge in my hip that will cause me to walk like an old woman for the first few minutes when I get up from my chair. Lately I’ve been having intense flashes of pain down my thigh that make me wonder if I can walk at all. Not all the time – maybe once per day – but goodness that’s disturbing. And I know what people will say – and they will be right – EXERCISE. Well maybe I will. After I eat the banana.I hope you’ve enjoyed this journey through my five senses.

{"title": "A Date with the Symphony", "date": "Tuesday, September 28, 2010", "text": "I went to the symphony for the first time last Thursday night. Or if not the first time, then the first time that I can remember. Although I used to listen to Rachmaninoff while doing my homework in high school (sometimes I switched it up with our Captain & Tennille 8 track tape), I've never been a huge classical music fan. I like music I can sing to. And, as my mom always said, it's scary – all quiet & lulls you into a drowse & then suddenly \"boom!\" there go the horns or the drums. It's a lot of work to listen to a classical piece of music, in my opinion.I went with some ladies from church – they needed a chauffeur & had a free ticket for me. It was the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra, with a guest violinist, Vadim Gluzman. Here's a list of what they played:BEETHOVEN Fidelio Overture SIBELIUS Violin Concerto (with Mr. Gluzman – a total teddy bear cutie, if you want my honest opinion)DEBUSSY La mer BEETHOVEN Leonore Overture #3 And here are my thoughts on the experience:We sang the Star Spangled Banner at the beginning! I thought that was great fun – although had I known in advance I might have limbered my voice up a little more. I loved the first piece, the Beethoven. That's what I think a symphony should sound like! Although I couldn't get Dudley Moore as the conductor in Foul Play out of my head. So I was probably smiling inappropriately. Or maybe people thought I was really a fan.The Sibelius with the guest \"fiddler\" reminded me of a series of an interminable number of some arpeggios. Up and down the scale, all random, with \"interesting\" syncopation. Really, he was playing the heck out of that violin & he was a joy to watch – so into the music & looking like he might burst with it before he finished. But. I couldn't really find the tune, you know? And apparently that matters to me. So I mostly just watched him & the rest of the orchestra, which was actually quite fascinating.The Debussy, I was astounded to find, reminded me of the warm-up the orchestra did between each number (I had no idea that instruments needed to be tuned every 20 minutes). At the end there was some very satisfactory percussion & double bass playing (I want to play an instrument bigger than me!), but most of the time I was people watching rather than enjoying the music. I was astounded because for some reason I assumed I would like Debussy. And then we were back to Beethoven & I was so excited because I thought I would like it. Not so much. However, there was a small section that reminded me of the song from Oklahoma that Will and Ado Annie sing – \"With me, it's all or nuthin!\" So I left the symphony with that running through my head, which was great fun.So, did I have a good time? Absolutely. Would I go again? You betcha! Just people watching was fabulous – especially the brass section (they didn't have too much to do with this performance, other than a few blasts to wake up the crowd, or is that not what the composer intended?). I loved watching the faces & body language of the musicians. And I got to sing the Star Spangled Banner and that's not something you get to do every day. So, score!"},

I’m not entirely sure which books were actually on those shelves, or which of my aunts had left these books behind – probably all four, although the aunt I called Mimi was the horse nut – but to me it was a treasure trove. I’m pretty sure that’s where I found Heidi, and lost myself in her world. If I felt especially brave I might even read the book in the slanted roof room!**The slanted roof room was an addition built on the house where the ceiling slanted so steeply that I couldn’t stand at one end of the room. It seemed ominous to me & I always felt very brave when I spent any time there – it was my version of a haunted house!"},

Well, I just happen to have such a poem – written five years ago for a cousin's wedding (it was for a scrapbook for her - I was glad to contribute since I couldn't attend the wedding). I did update it slightly (because, you know, it's five years later). I wish for you what we have…One word, one lookAnd there we are – Together in that placeIn that timeWhere we firstKnew love and each otherIt's not ESPBut it's close – that readingOf that other mindSo different yet soIn tune…Harmony, dissonanceThat invisible connectionForged by 20 yearsOf words and looksIt is unbreakablePlease note: this is a different cousin's wedding - she's the one who made the scrapbook for the other cousin.

It's looking very droopy since we haven't had any rain to speak of. I love this one – it looks cantankerous. And I took a picture of what I thought was a mysterious blue flower growing by our back door. Yes, that is indeed dryer lint. It was twilight – I couldn't really see! Heh.Thursday, September 16thAfter missing a few Tax Time Pig outfits I had to stop to get a picture of this one – too funny! That is a seriously ginormous bear!And Dr. M captured this picture of a bird landing on the bird bath. Friday, September 17thMy dad's birthday! But since I'm not there, this picture has nothing to do with that. It's a picture of the low lying fog which was pretty amazing Friday morning. Dr. M took this one. Saturday, September 18thToday we went up to Dr. M's school so that he could provide some interpretation of an exhibit of pictures of underground railroad sites in their county.The photo exhibit was held in conjunction with a barn quilt tour and they had an exhibit of over 100 quilts that had been made by members of the county quilting club.

{"title": "Where in the World is Ann T. Hathaway?", "date": "Wednesday, September 15, 2010", "text": "Living in community is hard. It's joyful & hilarious & comforting & all kinds of uplifting too. But life is not all happy happy joy joy and sometimes it hurts to have friends. I've done a fairly good job of being distant from my in real life friends all these years – literally & figuratively. You won't get a random call from me (unless it's your birthday - & even then it's iffy – sorry KJ!). It's not that I don't want to know what's happening – it's that maybe I'll have to be with you in your misery as well as your joy. I'm not really very good at that – and I tend to anesthetize my feelings with food or mindless computer games. Add the stresses of my own life and you have the recipe for a coronary. And now I have an online community, & bloggers have a way of not letting you keep your distance. It's all this intimate reading of each other's thoughts & feelings. I find myself having to be with these folks in their misery & joy too. And of course, it's a little easier to do that over the interwebs. I can write a nice comment and feel like I've \"been\" with the person. Most of the time that doesn't let me off the hook – I still feel for the person even if I've moved on to the next blog.But when it's really hard, and what's making my heart hurt these days, is when they go away. Sometimes we know why. Barry left us and his wife Linda told us about it. We're still mourning his loss – and there are certain posts where I still wonder what he would say about what I wrote. Goldenrod left us, and her daughter Polimom told us about it. I can't believe that force of nature with whom I just had a great phone conversation in July, is now lost to us. And there have been bloggers who just decided that it was time for them to close their blogs. And they told us they were leaving, so we could say goodbye if we needed to (or maybe I stalked them tracked them down so I could say goodbye). And now Ann T. Hathway is missing entirely. Her blog is still there, with no portent of doom. The last post is a happy one. But she hasn't posted since before Labor Day. And she doesn't respond to email. And she apparently doesn't answer the phone (another blogger (thanks Gia!) has tried to call and had the police do a well-being check). And I'm so desperately afraid for this woman I've never met. Maybe she needed a break, but I'm pretty sure she would have told us. So I'm left imagining the worst and hoping she'll read this post & be embarrassed and mad about it. I really want her to be mad at me. In fact, I'm praying for it.P.S. Almost immediately after I finished writing this I felt as though a weight had lifted from my shoulders. Writing my pain helped dissapate it. And that reminds me of why I blog in the first place - to get all that emotion out there for the world to see so that it can help carry the load. Thanks!"},
{"title": "I'm a Versatile Blogger!", "date": "Tuesday, September 14, 2010", "text": "Don’t Feed the Pixies has given me an award! Well, I think I got it by default. But since I really enjoy talking about myself I’ll play along. I’m supposed to tell seven things about myself & then pass along the award to seven people. As I’m typing this I’m fairly certain I will be skipping the second part, but we’ll see after all that nice talking about myself.1. I used to carry my lunch when I was in high school. I didn’t want to figure out what table to sit at. I’m not sure I was afraid of rejection, exactly, but I WANTED TO BE LEFT ALONE TO READ MY BOOK IN PEACE. I always had the same thing (or at least I did my senior year) – a livermush sandwich. Wonder what I took to drink? I certainly never touched the everclear the yearbook photographer (another senior – not an adult!) would bring in for his lunch. 2. I once worked as an admin for an agency that provided services to rape & domestic abuse survivors. And I was a square peg in a round hole in that place – it is very hard working with a lot of touchy feely women if you’re a non touchy feely woman. I was forever offending someone. That said – these were some of the best people I ever worked with. They used their energy & empathy to help other women, so they didn’t have any left to combat me.3. My mother is forever invading my dreams. Sometimes it’s just ordinary stuff & other times I wonder what in the world my subconscious is trying to tell me. Just over the weekend I dreamed that she was sort of Joan Crawford-ish & she spoke in that fake British accent that people seemed to have back then. Ya’ll, my mom was from North Carolina. And she was probably the opposite of Mommy Dearest. Very odd. 4. My dream home would have a living room large enough to hold a table for a jigsaw puzzle. I would quit blogging & just work puzzles every evening.5. I am working really hard to embrace fall this year. I try thinking thoughts like, “surely everyone is tired of pictures of hummingbirds and finches,” and, “aren’t these cooler days fabulous?” But, really, what’s playing in the back of my head is dark commutes on the way to & from work, having to wear my coat, and driving in the snow. Sigh.6. Aren’t we to seven yet? I’m counting this question as revealing something about myself.7. Just now I was looking at the Ohio flag flying outside my office window & remembering all the brouhaha about how Obama had created his own flag for his Obamanation – and the picture they showed was of the Ohio state flag. Oh I laughed for many days about that one. Well, as I suspected, I am not going to pass this award along. Although, frankly there are a number of you about which that I would enjoy reading more. So, feel free to take this award & run with it if you’re so inclined."},
{"title": "Chill", "date": "Sunday, September 12, 2010", "text": "Yes, this is the ceiling of our bedroom. The other night while I was waiting on Dr. M to finish playing Farmville, I was lying in bed staring up at it thinking about all of our problems. I can't really talk about all of them, and I don't want this post to be a list of \"issues\" (but if you must know I am about tired of my arthritis, shoulder & tail bone hurting, among other things).I just wanted to point out that, looking up at the ceiling, thinking about all my many concerns big and small, the spackled ridges appeared to recede so that instead of seeing all these random mountain ranges I was now looking at oddly shaped plateaus. It's a trick of the eyes similar to those 3-D pictures that were all the rage about 20 years ago. And no, there were no \"medications\" involved (unless you count Kroger Big K Diet Citrus Drop). The eye trick doesn't happen when I'm staring fixedly at the ceiling. I have to relax my eyes and let them cross & wander a bit. I started thinking about perspective and how these plateaus seemed a little gentler than all those ridges. And here is my big takeaway from the incident: I should just relax and stop staring so fixedly at my problems. Some of them won't go away if I ignore them, but I don't need to keep my laser focus on them at all times. Just chill every now & then & enjoy the plateau before tackling the mountain again.Whew! I wasn't sure I'd get to a Wordzzle this week – I had a really busy weekend! But I wrote the mini while getting the oil changed in my car, and just finished the 10-worder. I think I'll skip the mega this week – I want to write a regular post (no poem!) for tomorrow. Words for the mini: lawn mower, sheets and towels, smashed, bookcase, pinky fingerThe sound of a lawn mower in the yard next door awakened Phyllis from a light doze. Why was she sleeping in the middle of the day? Groggily she looked at the basket of neatly folded sheets & towels on the chair beside the sofa. Oh yeah, she had smashed her pinky finger carrying the basket back to the linen closet. The story of her life - a task she had done a million times turned perilous without warning. It was just too much so she flopped on the couch to sulk. She must have fallen asleep. Rolling onto her back she glanced toward the bookcase and the envelope propped against her Dick Francis collection. Perhaps the throbbing finger wasn't the real reason she had decided to check out for a while. There were decisions to be made about the contents of that envelope. Sighing, she closed her eyes again and listened to the mower next door making neat rows out of ragged grass.Words for this week's 10-word challenge were: charm, judge, flowers, mixed nuts, earthquake, politics, sugar and spice, bricks and mortar, neurosurgeon, blinking lights, plastic bag \"His family has all the charm of bricks and mortar,\" said Karen as she arranged flowers in a vase, conveniently forgetting that the flowers were a \"welcome to the family\" gift from her fiancé's mother. \"I was on my best sugar and spice behavior and they just sat there staring at me and started talking about politics again. At least they'd dropped the earthquake topic. Booorrring!\" There was no one in the room – Karen just liked to talk to herself. No one else was as interesting as she was. She was excited to be engaged to a neurosurgeon, but did he always have to be so serious? She had mentioned once that his family didn't have to be sober as a judge all the time – and Rodney said that his father was a judge. Sigh. Perhaps she'd best call the whole thing off.______\"Her family has all the intelligence of a plastic bag,\" Rodney said as he carefully selected cashews out of a can of mixed nuts, conveniently forgetting that the nuts were a \"welcome to the family\" gift from Karen's mother. \"They don't give a fig about politics and had never even heard of the earthquake we were discussing!\" There was no one in the room – Rodney just liked hearing the sound of his own voice.He thought Karen was beautiful and charming, and hadn't really noticed before that she didn't have an opinion on anything – except shoes. And her family was just like her! Although her dad didn't care about shoes – his opinions were all about football. Sigh. Perhaps he'd best call the whole thing off.______ The next day Rodney called Karen and got her answering machine. He left a brief message asking for his ring back. Karen called Rodney and got his answering machine, leaving a long rambling discourse about how they just weren't right for each other so she wanted to break it off. She didn't mention the ring.That night they both saw the blinking lights as soon as they walked in the door. Each of them decided that they didn't want to hear the other begging so they ignored the lights & headed for the shower.______ The Bug threw the book down in disgust. Just check your blankety blank messages! Maybe there's one from your mother. Didja think of that? Huh? Huh? The Bug has no patience for romance characters who don't communicate.

We had a nice time driving around. I don't know the significance of this carving, but we thought it was really neat - & with the sun shining on it I decided that it was a sign that I needed to get a picture of it. It's actually two-sided – the angel carving is on the back.We had an adolescent humor moment & had to get a picture of this sign.And we found sheep! Imagine that!Monday, September 6thI guess it's appropriate that all of our Labor Day pictures are of produce. This first picture is of the tomatoes that we're hoping will ripen off the vine. It's just been too cool in the evenings. I don't remember - was it Rita? - but yes, I'd love if you'd send me your fried green tomato recipe!Next is a picture of the squash vine – it's still producing quite well. Must like the cooler weather.And here are a couple pictures of part of our supper – tomatoes, the refrigerator pickles Dr. M made with our cucumbers, and squash & zucchini (the zucchini was from someone else's garden). We had sweet potatoes, grilled chicken & steak with this.Tuesday, September 7thOn Tuesday Dr. M took a picture of some of our squash.And I took a picture of a science experiment. The sweet potato we ate last night was growing so Dr. M put a chunk in some water to see what it would do.Wednesday, September 8thWe still have some lovely flowers around here.Thursday, September 9thOn Thursday I took a picture of the fog on my way to work. This doesn't really do it justice – it's just so pretty & fluffy over all the fields in the mornings.The sunflower field on Dr. M's way to work is just gorgeous. Friday, September 10thOn Friday Dr. M got some pictures of, guess what? Birds! I love how the finch looks so self-important - & I love the reflection of the birds in the water.That night Dr. M & I worked my church's booth at a local festival - selling rootbeer floats. This was dinner – BBQ pulled pork nachos. Yum!Saturday, September 11thToday we went to the first home football game of the season at Dr. M's university. And they won! It was a great game. This is a picture of the band – yes, they call their area is called The Pit of Despair. The band is really good this year – we were impressed, especially since they only have about 27 members.And here is a picture of our booth at the festival – yes we worked another shift today. I love this poster that one of our folks created for our booth. Especially on this day we should remember that we are called to love, not hate. Just because other people thrive on hate doesn't mean that we have to join in. Am I less of an American because I don't hate innocent Muslims? Am I less of an American because I think that more killing isn't an answer? Frankly, I'm not sure I even care about that – What Would Jesus Do? That's the question I care about.

A governor who was upset that he was upstaged by the president. This, then, was the 1894 genesis of Labor Day. Basically created so we'll shut up and deliver the mail without obstruction.

This week's driver, Pure Fiction, has asked us to write about a moment of transformation. My moment of transformation happened back in seminary (no it wasn't the Old Testament paper I wrote about last week). I wrote a bit about the actual moment here (although I had my day wrong - it was July 23rd, not the 21st). Dr. M & I playing a game with J & K - we're just friends I tell you! Friends!I wanted to write aboutHow you waited under that treeAbout how you slippedSurreptitiously into The fabric of my life.I wanted to write aboutMy denial and qualmAbout the way you creptCovertly into my dreams.I wanted to write aboutDesire and a kitchen accidentAbout souls stealingSilently away together.But it made me blushSo I didn’t.Our first ChristmasStill just friends?  Sunday, August 29thWhy look here – it's a hummingbird picture! And that's it for fauna this week – except for the picture of Dr. M on Wednesday. Heh. About every six months I get a hankering for Skyline Chili. It's a Cincinnati specialty that I thought was the most bizarre food in the universe when we moved here. Chili? On spaghetti? Topped with a mountain of cheese? How very odd! Now it's a favorite food (the secret ingredient is chocolate - so we know I'm all over that) – but one I can't eat too often. Please note that it's served with oyster crackers as an appetizer. As a good Baptist I was a bit disturbed the first time they placed the little bowl in front of me – we only ate oyster crackers at communion when I was growing up in North Carolina. Mine is a four way with beans (chili, spaghetti, cheese, beans). Dr. M got the five way - which comes with onions. See – I only ate about half of it – the rest made a most excellent Monday lunch.Monday, August 30thOn Monday I took a picture of the rising sun on my way to work. Fortunately, this stretch of road is the only bit where I face the sun – the rest of my commute is going the other direction. Tuesday, August 31stOn Tuesday Dr. M took some picture at a local farm. I just love this silo & the barn with its rock foundation.Wednesday, September 1stOn Wednesday Dr. M participated in the Student Activities Fair. It was in the 90s that day & they didn't have a tent – so he improvised with this ginormous umbrella I accidentally bought him. I knew he needed a big one that would withstand wind gusts, but I didn't really know I was ordering one THAT huge. I have to hold it with both hands when I try to use it!On my way home from work I took a picture of this three-wheeler. I want one! I'll bet I wouldn't spend nearly as much money on gas, & I'm pretty sure I could drive it. Pretty sure. So, Daddy, this Christmas, instead of the Prius I've been asking for, you can just get me one of these. With a matching helmet. Heh.Thursday, September 2ndWe finally talked Martha Goose into going back to school. We may have had to resort to bribes.Friday, September 3rd.

But then I look at the words & my brain starts whirring (tonight Dr. M was asking what that noise was), and out come the stories. Really, I have no control. Sorry.Words for the mini: carpet, cane, outer space, handball, ambitious\"I have been called on the carpet for the last time,\" Sheila thought. \"This company's expectations are from outer space.\" Aloud, deliberately misunderstanding, she said, \"Well, Mr. Cane, I would enjoy playing 'handball' with you, but I'm not that ambitious!\" With that, she cheerfully marched out of the company field-day plan ning committee meeting and into unemployment.Words for the 10 word challenge: pyramid, laughter, orangutan, recycling, infinity, toilet paper, greasy dishes, Spanish, preparation, back-upIt was a pyramid scheme set up by an orangutan. It was greasy dishes with dried on Spanish rice. It was buying toilet paper into infinity. It was recycling and a computer back-up. The preparation had been full of laughter. The marriage was full of work!And here's my mega: pyramid, laughter, orangutan, recycling, infinity, toilet paper, greasy dishes, Spanish, preparation, back-up, carpet, cane, outer space, handball, ambitiousSylvia needed to take a walk. She finally had her outer space under control. It was the infinity of her inner space that had \"issues.\" No matter how hard she tried to improve herself, she couldn't seem to find that one thing that didn't make her feel like an orangutan trying to learn Spanish. Actually, she would put money on the orangutan learning the language before she did. Taking up handball hadn't been any better. And she spent her days recycling those old mental messages. \"You're no better than the toilet paper stuck to the bottom of my shoe.\" \"Greasy dishes have more personal style than you do.\" What had begun in love and laughter had ended with her sobbing on the carpet of her bedroom floor. Fortunately she'd had a back-up plan. It wasn't very ambitious - just staying with a relative down south - but with enough preparation she'd been able to escape. Over time those old negative messages would be overcome by the affirmations she forced herself to read every day. \"You are beautiful!\" \"You can achieve anything with hard work!\" Walking along the sugar cane field, she stopped at a clear place and drew a pyramid in the sand. It was her talisman. She envisioned herself standing at the top, poised to fly, over the cane field, over Louisiana, into the loveliness of her own beautiful self.

I had to modify it (well, had to isn't really right - I got bored with trying to make it work so I modified it just a bit). I'm not at all sure it even makes sense, but we all have to start somewhere. And, of course, since it's my blog I'm going to share it with you, regardless of quality. Aren't you lucky? No?  (Oh, and if you read my post from earlier today you'll note that my writer's block has not gone away. Heh.)Bated DaysThese are bated daysThough my heart is beating stillWith summer’s wanton waysThe air is still and staysHeavy upon the window sill These are bated daysThe parched grass swaysMarching in time downhillAmid summer’s wanton ways I am content with my malaiseCan I stave off winter with my will?These are bated daysAll that’s left is hazeOh could we but distillthis summer’s wanton waysThe nut-brown child playsUntil he gets his fillThese are bated daysTeeming with summer’s wanton waysThis poem is part of One Stop Poetry's One Shot Wednesday poetry gathering, where all poets are welcome to share. Make the rounds!So, my last post was on Saturday night. Yeah, been kind of quiet on the old blog since then. Sometimes (and I know this will amaze and astound you) my brain takes a brief hiatus. Last night I lay in bed composing the best blog post ever! Um, no. The morning light was a little too harsh on that bit of drivel. Aren’t you glad I didn’t get up in the night & just go ahead & post it? Really, you are. So, since I am not having any original thoughts, I decided to quote someone else.I’ve quoted Mother Barbara Crafton on here before. She’s an Episcopal priest who sends motivational emails (eMo’s) from The Geranium Farm. In her latest one she talks about how so often if we slack off or fail at something we just give up. “Oh well, I guess I just won’t make that happen this time.” I totally have that mentality – it’s all or nothing with me. At the end of the eMo she says:Oh, but I've lost so much time! Well, okay. So the answer to that is to lose some more? Never mind what you've lost -- what can you find in the time that remains to you? How's this for an epitaph: She was off to a good start and then made a few errors. Concluding that this made all her past efforts worthless, she resolved never to try again, and she never did. Some time later, she died. No? I didn't like it, either.

{"title": "The Poetry Bus Goes to School", "date": "Saturday, August 28, 2010", "text": "Here we are at the Poetry Bus again (what, does this bus come around every week?). The lovely Karen, who apparently values education, is the driver & is planning quite a trip. Please go to her blog here to check out the other bus riders – there are already some great poems out there.Her prompt this week was very simple: write a poem about school or schooling. Well, I have certainly had my share of school. This poem is about a paper I had to write in seminary. Old Testament TherapyI wailed my waythrough that paper.I covered the floorwith notes and booksand discarded pagesand tears.Heart and soul - if not mind - went into those words.At the end I feltempty and victorious.Dr. Ballentinegave me a C.We both knew that what I had writtenwas catharsisand not academia.And that was fine. Because a small chunkof my dear battered selfswam free in those tears.P.S. If you read \"beer battered self\" the first time, you are not alone. That's what I saw myself when I first read it through. And now I'm hungry! But disturbed…Sunday, August 22ndDespite the fact that this week contains a little more variety in pictures, we start out with a little hummingbird action. (Little. Hummingbird. I kill myself).Later that evening Dr. M got a picture of some mushrooms thriving behind our garden. The rest of the yard might be crackly dry, but The Watering Man keeps his garden moist enough for mushrooms!Monday, August 23rdMonday was such a nice day that I went out to my car at lunch & listened to my audio book a while (a better plan would be to put on my walking shoes & listen to the book while I walk, but let's not get crazy now).That night Dr. M took a picture of the full moon. Gorgeous!Tuesday, August 24thOn Tuesday I downloaded a new audio book. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't recommend any of the books you see listed there, although the Fern Michaels series The Sisterhood is actually very entertaining. I just get annoyed with the soliloquies the characters are so fond of. You know, where a normal book might have a pause & a back & forth between characters, these ones just keep talking until they've said everything on their minds & then they let the other person talk. Very annoying. Well, and the fact that the plot is extra implausible. But a little implausibility hasn't really stopped me from enjoying a book in the past.Wednesday, August 25thI just noticed that last Wednesday's post had tomatoes in it too – but here are my grape tomatoes, still going strong.If there's a Reds or Braves game on, we're watching it.Thursday, August 26thThursday was a gorgeous day, so Dr. M & I both couldn't resist taking pictures. This first one is one I took on my way home from work.Here's a finch picture Dr. M took. I like how it looks like the finch is doing some sort of yoga – Downward Bird perhaps?One of our dry cornfields, on Dr. M's way home from work.The spires of Antioch College. It went bankrupt a few years ago, but it's planning on reopening. It's a lovely campus. Dr. M drives by it every day. I have a secret hope that he would get a job there – it's closer than his current school. However, perhaps he should wait until it's actually a viable enterprise again. (Please note, Dr. M doesn't necessarily share this pipe dream. That's ok - I think it's healthy for couples to have separate pipe dreams).Friday, August 27thIt's the Tax Time Pig! This week she's Minnie Mouse. Dr. M got this picture of a finch who appears to be checking out the antics of a squirrel running across our yard.Saturday, August 28thToday I went to a birthday party for three year old twins. Oh man I'm exhausted & all I did was take pictures & eat cake. Fortunately it was held at a petting farm in Cincinnati – it was fun watching the kids pet the animals (although some of them weren't too sure about these creatures). Here are a handful of pictures I took. I dream of a day when ducks & chickens can sit down at a meal together…On my way home I finally stopped to take a picture of a tobacco barn I pass every day. It's actually the same farm that has sheep, but I haven't seen them very often this summer – they're too smart to be out in the sun! I don't like smoking or the smell of cigarettes, but I'll bet the tobacco in this barn smells like heaven – really!While I was at the birthday party, Dr. M took some excellent butterfly pictures - now that you've read my post you have to go here to see his pictures.Go here to see the blogs of all the other Project 365 participants."},
{"title": "Weekly Wordzzle - The Fluffy Edition", "date": "Friday, August 27, 2010", "text": "Oh my goodness it’s fluffy Wordzzle week! I’ve been reading too many really terrible books that I can’t put down. And there’s no end in sight – I’m reading a whole series of books (I’m on Book 7 of 16) and I feel like a rubbernecker at a train wreck. I can’t stop watching. Oh well, I have a Dean Koontz book scheduled for next month. I can regain some of my capacity for intelligent thought then.Words for the mini: fluid, acreage, fasten, tripe, pagesSighing, I flip through the pages. I can’t believe I’m really reading this tripe. I’m starting to wonder if I was hypnotized as a child & told that it was illegal to skip through to the end if I didn’t want to read the whole book. Because I just can’t do it – and that’s illogical! The story is ok, but the writing is horrendous. But I’m hooked now – I have to find out what the mysterious fluid is that’s seeping into the ground at Torpor House. It’s amazing that the heroine found it at all, what with the vast acreage of the estate. I fasten my gaze on the paragraphs in front of me, ready to slog through to the end. Words for the 10-worder: corner, cold-stone, rolex, sole, effortless, raindrops, eyebrow, speaker, amusing, leaptStanding in the corner by the enormous speaker, Allison wondered if she’d ever get up the nerve to actually join the party. Her friend Julie obviously found all the mingling effortless. She didn’t have any trouble talking to the handsome guy with the cold-stone stare and the Rolex watch. He even lifted an eyebrow, seeming to find Julie amusing. Allison sighed, then her heart leapt as Mr. Gorgeous headed her way. “Calm down, Allison, calm down, it’s just some normal human interaction. People do it all the time without tragic consequences.” Allison was horrified to realize that the words were actually coming out of her mouth. Mr. Gorgeous started laughing out loud and said that Julie had decided that they should get to know each other & had sent him over. Allison was mortified all over again – she might have to kill Julie later. But maybe not. He started talking to her as if his sole purpose in life was to find out her deepest secrets and make them his. Allison never did join the party. They talked long into the night, and all the words were cool raindrops washing away her loneliness. Words for the mega: corner, cold-stone, rolex, sole, effortless, raindrops, eyebrow, speaker, amusing, leapt, fluid, acreage, fasten, tripe, pagesI have spent entirely too much time indulging in my favorite ice cream at Cold Stone Creamery. Truthfully, I would rather have Peanut Butter Cup Perfection than a Rolex. Actually, this is an easy decision to make because I’ve given up wearing watches. As a Type F personality (I’m sure that one exists – or maybe it should be Type S for Slothful) I have made a fluid transition into watchless existence.For example, it’s so much easier to listen to the speaker up there spouting his tripe when I don’t have any idea how long he’s been at it. I have, however, been counting his pages of notes as he turns them. Yikes! Perhaps, if I pull out my small hand mirror I can practice raising one eyebrow as if I find all of this amusing, in a “you are so beneath me” sort of way. But I’m afraid the folks sitting beside me might not think that was quite the thing to do at a lecture on time management. Sigh. He needs to finish – I think they’re calling for rain later.Anyway, about ice cream. I couldn’t fasten my jeans this morning. I got them zipped, but the button was a no go. This used to be an effortless part of my day, and the sole reason it no longer is lurks on a corner scant minutes from my home. All this additional acreage on my backside is really unattractive. Next time I go I’ll get the Berry Berry Good with Sinless Sweet Cream. Who am I kidding – I’ll get the peanut butter again. Sigh. I might have to move.What’s this? All the people around me have leapt to their feet. Talking Dude must be finished at last! Obviously this attempt to better myself was a bust. Perhaps I should take up bicycling instead. I ponder this idea all the way to my car, where I miss the raindrops by minutes. Am I lucky or what?You should go to Raven's blog to read the other Wordzzle participants.

{"title": "Here’s Something Weird…", "date": "Wednesday, August 25, 2010", "text": "I can’t believe I haven’t blogged about this before. It’s such a bizarre phenomenon. It all started almost a year ago. Whenever I get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night I invariably have to sneeze. Sometimes, if I’m patient, I can stand by the bed until the sneeze comes. But usually it’s only after I’ve snuggled down under the covers that sneezing occurs. And I am no dainty sneezer. Poor Dr. M - I’m sure I startle him awake (he’s been too polite to mention it).I have tried to come up with explanations for this explosive dead of night sneezing. I thought maybe it was our laundry detergent, or dust on my nightstand. But we’ve had those same things for YEARS (I’m not much of a housekeeper, as you well know). AND I do the sneezing thing on vacations and at my dad’s house. It’s a mystery.So I’ve finally decided that it can only be explained by one thing. As I approach peri-menopause I have developed an allergy to going back to bed once awakened. An allergy that is apparently not soothed by my nightly Claritin. I’m a little traumatized by the whole concept - one of the great pleasures of life is to wake at 3:00 in the morning, go to the bathroom, & realize that you have another 3 hours to sleep. What if this sneezing starts interfering with that? Is the answer to wear adult diapers & not have to get up? Will I start having sneeze induced insomnia? Hi, my name is Bug, and I have a sneeze disorder.** I am being a tad overdramatic - I usually only sneeze once & then go right back to sleep. Still, weird, right?"},

I don't know if it's because I'm tired of having the same finch, garden & hummingbird pictures on my Project 365 post (not!) or if posting those pictures has made me more aware of necessary passage of time (yes). In any case, here is a list of reasons why I know I'm ready for fall:I am tired of messing with my toes! Polish* them, take the polish off, file them for heaven's sake (instead of clipping them within an inch of their life), put more polish on. It just takes entirely too much effort. I'm ready to slather those puppies with lotion & cover them with cotton socks (can't contemplate woollies until winter).I'm ready for baseball season to end. Yes, I know that I have two more months, but we're winding down. I want to start going to bed by 10:00 every night!I am so tired of my summer clothes. I guess I could buy something new, but I really hate shopping, & we are trying to not spend unnecessary dollars right now. I'm ready for cooler temps (she says with \"dew\" on her upper lip). I can't think of anything else. The truth is that I'm still a little sad at the idea that summer will be over (sort of) soon. But I'm going to put my game face on & get ready to take pictures of fall leaves. After all, I don't actually have much choice in the matter!*Does anyone else see the country first & then realize that it's supposed to be color for nails?"},

{"title": "Weekly Wordzzle - The Humorless Edition", "date": "Friday, August 20, 2010", "text": "Lookit! I actually did three stories this week! Unfortunately I didn't feel all that humorous apparently, but you can't get everything all the time. The mini: wine, plundered, signifying, river, survivorA day by the river is as heady as wine. As a survivor of the rat race I appreciate this stolen day when I could be doing something more productive. The sun dips below the horizon, signifying the end of the magic. Sighing, having plundered all the riches this day had to offer, I head for home.The 10-worder: rocks, rip this joint, casino, tumbling dice, frayed, angel, cup, on the run, ventilator, faceHer nerves frayed & her hands trembling, Angel placed her cup gingerly on the table. Only a little of the water sloshed over the edge. She wished she'd been able to get scotch on the rocks instead, but the hospital cafeteria didn't offer liquor on the menu. Imagine that. Hiding in the cafeteria gave her a sense of being on the run from reality, a reality she wasn't sure she could face just now. The ventilator on that beloved face. The incessant beeping. The knowledge that this was the end of the road. She'd spent most of her life tumbling dice in a casino – where was her luck now? Where was his? Suddenly, she was horrifyingly angry. So angry that she felt she could rip this joint apart without even breaking a sweat. Just as suddenly, the anger was gone. In its place was an emptiness she didn't want to examine too closely. Sighing, she finished her water and headed to the elevator bank. On the way up she'd practice her best smile for her best guy.The Mega: rocks, rip this joint, casino, tumbling dice, frayed, angel, cup, on the run, ventilator, face, wine, plundered, signifying, river, survivorThe Survivor watched from the shadows, his face hidden while people entered & exited the casino. He hadn't expected to end up here, on this night, watching this door, when he'd first gone looking for justice. On the run, really, hiding from those who wished him harm. He was no angel. The thought made him laugh so hard inside he almost made a sound. Almost. Gotta keep quiet and keep watching the door. When it opened he could hear the sound of a wine-soaked, vodka on the rocks, tumbling dice good time. When it shut he could hear the sound of his shallow breathing and the cars on the road a few feet away. Then the white limousine pulled to the door, signifying that his vigil was almost over. Delia was leaving the casino. With his evidence. Quickly and quietly he started toward the white car, planning to slip inside while the chauffer was on the other side. Mick and the boys were singing, \"Rip this Joint\" as the casino door opened. Delia seemed a little worse for wear – frayed around the edges – as she minced toward the chauffer. She always did wear heels too high for the bit of grace she possessed. The giant shoulder bag seemed out of place with the slinky evening wear, but then again, he wasn't the fashion police. As long as that bag held the evidence he needed to prove his innocence. He hadn't plundered the casino accounts. He was no embezzler. What he was, was framed. But the Survivor would not slink off into the night. He would work until every last one of his enemies was looking up at him from a hospital bed, breathing through a ventilator, with terror filled eyes. Forcing himself to calm down, he silently opened the car door & slid inside. Delia let out a small gasp when she got in the car, automatically reaching for the small gun in her bag before she recognized him. She put out a hand to cup his face and smiled with triumph right before she pulled the trigger. Gasping, the Survivor awoke from the nightmare. His old bones creaked as he rose from the bed to sit in his one chair, dropping his head in his hands. He never had avenged those old wrongs. His love for Delia and that damned dream kept him chained to the past. He knew he was a coward, but he would never know if she would have betrayed him. He didn't want to know. What was beyond the bend in the river was always going to be just that – beyond.You should go to Raven's blog to read the other Wordzzle participants. And join in – it can be addictive!"},

It’s a really good way to get to know him better, and to give you insight into why I say I’m the fluff to his depth. He’s a really cool person, if I do say so myself (having had very little influence into how he turned out, I take full credit). So go read it. Now. And then come back to read my not quite as fluffy as usual post. Our diocese has a monthly publication with stories about the goings on in southern Ohio. This past month one of the members of my former church (hey Nancy!) had an article about an immigration reform rally that she attended. I know that immigration is a hot button for a lot of people, but this story*, told at the rally, sums up my feelings on the subject pretty well:A rabbi put this question to his students: \"How can we determine the hour of dawn. When the night ends and the day begins?”\"When from a distance you can distinguish between a dog and a sheep,\" suggested one. \"When you can distinguish between a fig tree and a grapevine,” offered another.\"No,\" the rabbi said, \"When you look into the face of a human being and have enough light to recognize that person as your brother or sister. Up until then it is night, and darkness is still with us.\"If we aren’t able to recognize the person in front of us as a brother or sister, then we dwell in darkness. And I’m not just talking about the way we look at immigrants either. It feels like everyone around me is in an armed camp – me & mine versus you and yours. It’s ours, people. Really – we’re all on this earth together. Sitting in the dark, or holding out a lamp to the incoming stranger. *Not having the Interchange with me when I wrote this post I looked the story up online. There are a lot of different versions, so I just picked one to use. However, I have since found the Interchange online. You can read the artcle on page 17 here."},

We had put up a handful of pictures in our house when we moved last July, but the rest have been stacked in the bedroom. So I finally went through them to decide what I want to hang up, what I want to get rid of, and what I want to store (because we don't have room for them). I had a grand old time. I got into one box where all the pictures were wrapped in newspaper. Just for fun I checked out the date – 1995! This box had been packed up three moves ago & never opened! Needless to say, most of those pictures went into the discard pile.I bundled up all the newspaper and took it out to the recycling bin in the garage. Out of the corner of my eye I saw this:\"Life, uh... finds a way.\" Dr. Ian Malcom in Jurassic ParkReally? I posted pictures on Saturday about how, um, abundant, the cypress vine has been, but snaking under the garage door and blooming in a place where there isn't very much light? There aren't any windows in our garage, and the door isn't left open that many hours a day. Wow. All I can say is that if this vine can find a place to bloom in the garage, then perhaps I can stop my (mostly inward) whining and pay more attention to the blessings of my life.

The bird bath was very popular since it's been so hot & dry. Here is the first of five birdbath pictures.And here is one of our squashes. I think they look so odd while they're growing.Monday, August 9thOn Monday took these butterfly pictures – I think it's the same butterfly, but the light hits it so differently that in one picture its wings are translucent & in the other picture they're fairly opaque. Do ya'll agree – same dude?Here's another birdbath picture. I laugh every time I see it – as Dr. M says in his Facebook caption – Did you have to do that? Heh.Tuesday, August 10thWith so much activity in the birdbath there is bound to be some debris. I love this feather.Wednesday, August 11thOn Wednesday Dr. M took this cow picture on his way home from school. I don't know why, but the combo of the color of the cow & the color of the grass is just very pleasing to me – I think this is the third cow picture I've posted for that very reason.More birdbath fun – this little fellow is REALLY getting into the splashing!After seeing all the little birds, this dove looks like Godzilla or something. If you look you can see a wasp taking a drink of water in the birdbath too. I have a close-up of the wasp below.Thursday, August 12thOn Thursday Dr. M followed a hummingbird and a butterfly around. I think he got some pretty good shots!Here's a close-up of that \"coming in for a landing\" shot Friday, August 13thOn Friday I took a picture of some banana peppers that we left on the vine to change color. Wonder if they'll taste any good?And here is a picture of a wind chime that has been totally claimed by the tomatoes. Can you see it in there?For reference, here's a picture from July 8th where you can see the wind chime pretty well – it's the one on the right.Saturday, August 14thToday I've spent most of the morning doing bookkeeping stuff - shredding checks for an old account, updating accounts with a new phone number, reconciling statements. I did a lot of shredding!Then I went out into the sauna to check out the yard. It's so hot & muggy here - I really hope we have some rain this weekend!

The first question from the interviewer is, \"If you were to be offered this position, how would you make sure that all of our human resources databases are integrated into the correct modules?\" Pregnant pause, as I digest the question. \"Um. I'm unclear about how human resources databases relate to cleaning bathrooms, but if you give me an example, I'm sure I can figure it out. Or is this not the janitorial job?\" Back in my car I bang my head on the steering wheel for a while. I wonder if the interviewer is still laughing. I wonder if I could just sell the car and get enough money to go on a cruise. I could send a post card to the friend who set me up with an interview for a job as a PC Specialist.

{"title": "All We Like Sheep...", "date": "Monday, August 9, 2010", "text": "I know I’ve mentioned on here before that I have no shame. It’s mostly true. I just read an article in Self magazine called Formerly Hot, and I realized what a blessing it has been as I age that I’ve never considered myself very high in the hotness stakes. Maybe a 5 out of 10 back in my heyday. This means that I’m probably less traumatized by getting older than women who were 8s or 10s.Looking back at pictures I see a cute girl, a little on the plump side. And now, courtesy of a college friend on Facebook, I see a sheep. I remember that Halloween - we all went as Old MacDonald’s Farm - trick-or-treating for Unicef. I don’t remember how much money we raised, or how it all went, but I do remember my incessant sneezing from the baby powder. I think I was afraid that my \"makeup\" would crack if I smiled. I look like this when I'm bleaching my moustache too.As an average girl I probably tolerated non sexy sheepdom fairly well. Interesting that I’ve spent the years since this picture trying to not be a sheep. And married to a man who is sheep-obsessed. Life is a big circle, isn’t it?Dr. M has started his own blog! It's called Child of a Frosty Morn, & you can see its fabulousness here. I feel pretty smug about it – I drew him slowly into the blogverse until he was powerless to resist. Although he can be pretty silly sometimes, as a historian he is very thoughtful and highly opinionated – about just about everything under the sun. Bekah mentioned that she wanted her husband to start a blog so he could have an outlet for his political frustrations. I feel the same way about Dr. M – he only has me as a rant audience and I leave a lot to be desired in that area.Not that I expect his blog to only be a stage for rants. He's already posted two poems and a discussion of the textile mills in North Carolina. But I think we can safely say that his blog will be more about substance & I will be his fluffy foil. Which pretty much describes our marriage. Hey – it works!So check him out & give him a warm blogger welcome!"},

She had been trying to give it to me for years but we never had a place to put it. This little room still needs a lot of work, but the piano fits - & the best part is that I can plug headphones in so Dr. M doesn't have to hear me practicing! Thursday, August 5thThis picture is for Amy – she knows why. See – we can be a little redneck on trash day up here. I'm not planning on planting any flowers in it though. I'm so glad I took it Thursday morning! I forgot that I had taken it & told Dr. M that I had missed my first day of taking a picture. Whew! Friday, August 6thI took this picture as I left work on Friday. You can't read the sign, but it says, \"Space Reserved for Hybrid Vehicles.\" Hmm – I'm pretty sure a Hummer isn't a hybrid. Dr. M took this picture of one of our ripening tomatoes.And here is another butterfly for Ellen to identify. Saturday, August 7thWe had grand plans for today (or maybe I should say I had grand plans). I was going to do some decluttering, get groceries, and maybe go for a drive. But then I took a two hour nap during the Reds game. I guess there's still time to do some of the things if I can get awake enough LOL. While I was asleep, Dr. M took picture of another butterfly.

Mine is often like swiss cheese – and I am frantic, looking for milk and brine and mystery to fill those holes. All my efforts are marginal, at best. I can't control what bides or dies in the shallow recesses of my mind. Of course this leaves me feeling paranoid. Why do you insist on shining a light into those cheeseless spaces? After all of these meals of ham & swiss you are surely not surprised that I can't remember whether or not I washed your orange t-shirt (which I did – I just put it in with my shirts by accident), or that I can't quite grasp the operation of the remote control?

We had a nice time. Daddy & Amy were excellent hosts & I enjoyed going to one of Amy’s sons’ birthday party on Sunday. I’ll post some pictures later when my head feels less cotton woolly (which is a whole other feeling than Willow’s woolly socks feeling that I can’t even contemplate in August - ooh - my feet are getting hot just thinking about it!). Dr. M’s mom has good days and bad days. She sometimes knows who we are, which is nice. Physically, she seems to be very healthy. However, she’s unable to feed herself (problems with her hands) and, true or not, Dr. M’s father thinks that he has to be there for breakfast & lunch every day or she won’t get enough food. Every day. She’s been in this facility for 13 months and the only days he’s missed have been when the weather was too bad or when he was sick. Maybe five days? Although they’ve lived in their community & attended the same church for most of their lives, and although they have family living nearby, Dr. M’s father is alone in his daily mission. No one offers to help. He feels like he & Dr. M’s mom are in their own little world, all alone. Dr. M & I feel helpless. He feeds his mother when he’s in town, but we can’t be there that often. I want to write snarky little notes to all the folks I think should be helping, but I’m pretty sure that would be frowned upon by Dr. M and his father. So, we’ll just keep hoping someone wises up. And trying to go down there when we can. It’s what people do, isn’t it?"},

Oh I exaggerate. Just a bit. But does the poem that wasn't part of a meme count?

Ooh – maybe I'll get Daddy to write the Wordzzle!Senior PictureI wanted to talk a little bit about the poem from yesterday. When I was a senior in college I took a January mini course which involved a trip to the Over-the-Rhine area of Cincinnati (little did I know then that I would be working in Cincinnati 11 years later). We were visiting the \"inner city\" and helping with various projects - cleaning out apartments, working in soup kitchens, and helping with the Free Store Food Bank. I kept a journal as part of the class & mostly wrote poems. Yesterday's poem was about my experience of working intake at the Free Store. One of the workers was telling a mother to make her baby shut up. My 21 year old idealistic self was aghast. So I just wrote what I was feeling. Some of the other poems from that journal may show up elsewhere on the interwebs in the next few days. I'll definitely point you in the right direction if they do. I think that personally I'm done with them for now. I ache for that girl's naïve belief that she could fix the world & that the world wanted to be fixed. I didn't really turn into a real bleeding heart liberal until much later. But in January, in Over-the-Rhine, the seed was planted."},

While we were driving around we stopped by Maple Grove Cemetery. It has been in use for a very long time. There were lots of graves from the 19th century, including graves of black soldiers from the civil war. I don't know the age of the marker below, but it was probably sometime in the 1800s.

Not that I remember whether or not this poem was about romance. It could have been about my college roommate (KJ do you remember if I was upset with you in February of 1986?).

She wasn't expecting a delivery – the jewelry she had ordered (on sale!) off of Home Shopping Network wouldn't be here until next week.

You look terrible!\" \"Well, gee thanks,\" said the Bug ruefully, \"it was just a figure of speech for heaven's sake!\"Pleasantries over, they started talking about this and that. Kim mentioned a new workout she had heard about at their local Y – Jump Rope to the Music of Mozart. It sounded a lot more interesting than watching a soap opera from the treadmill. Then they discussed the new barbeque restaurant in town & wondered if the proprietor would frown if they brought their own sauce in. There just was no justification for not having Carolina barbeque sauce as one of the choices!Then, finally, Kim started talking about why she had come over. \"I saw a show about how we should all act first and think later and I just had to run right over to see what you thought about it!\"The Bug just started laughing. \"Kim, I saw that show too – it was saying that you should think first and act later!

I know – it's just one day, get back on the horse, or the wagon, or with the program, yada yada yada.

I'm missing the gratefulness portion of the program. I ordered my first pair of reading glasses on Friday. I discussed that to death here. But I'm actually kind of excited because when I was a kid I would pick out what I thought were cute glasses (it was the 70s people – I worked with what I had) but then they put the coke bottles in & the cuteness disappeared. These lenses shouldn't be as thick should they? I'm hoping… I will certainly post a picture of me reading something in my new glasses.My Magpie poem from Sunday apparently had depths that were too murky for most folks. I was writing about the American Indian addiction to alcohol, as well as my addiction to chocolate. I do tend to expect people to jump into my brain when they read my poems. Yeah, that sounds scary to me too!And last, but not least, I have to go to the dentist tomorrow. I gots a cavity. Yes, I revert to 4 years old when I have to get a filling. I'm not sure I've ever not had a traumatic experience getting a cavity filled – and I have LOTS of metal in my mouth so I have lots of experience with the trauma. I floss. I brush. What is the deal here? Anyway, that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach is me trying not to hyperventilate. I don't have such a phobia that I don't go to my twice yearly exams, but it's a near thing. I'm doing this for YOU Daddy – hope you appreciate it! Heh. Well, & there's that small matter of it hurting when I eat. Hey – maybe this is the answer to Pymwymi! UPDATE: I'm back from the dentist. He had to give me THREE shots before I was sufficiently numb (finding out you're not numb when he starts drilling is NO FUN). But it's done now.I'm pretty sure that all will be well in about 24 hours. But if you guys could send soothing vibes at around 12:30 tomorrow I would appreciate it.

There's one of the grape tomatoes (some of them are looking pinkish), the regular tomato plants, a customer at the bird bath, a volunteer flower in our front bed (possibly from the wildflower seed packet – just a late bloomer?), another squash leaf visitor, and another cypress vine flower.Go here to see the blogs of all the other Project 365 participants.I had decided to write a poem for the mini Wordzzle this week, and had just finished the scary little effort below when I read Argent's Poetry Bus instructions. The first ticket was to write something funny – I'm not sure I can top my grapefruit poem. But the second ticket definitely caught my eye:Tunnel of (unrequited) Love. … it's not always easy to love and not be loved in return. What's it like when that certain special somebody doesn't even know you exist (it's called stalking - Ed). Are they with someone else? Are you jealous? Come and share the bittersweetness with your bus-travelling friends.I'm not sure this mini poem meets all the requirements, but I couldn't ignore the synchronicity. Check out Delusions of Adequacy to read the other poems (most of which will be either VERY funny, or very bittersweet).Words for the mini: shade tree, price, disappointment, power, cameraSitting under a shade treefiddling with my cameraI've paid a price.Bitter disappointmentwars with longing.That longing has morepower over methan your restraining order.And, continuing with the Wordzzle, here is my effort for the 10-word challenge.Words for the 10-word challenge: shark, Scotland, gravity, final hours, aggravation, heat wave, sweet tooth, killer, tragic, flowers \"Ms. Bug, I don't believe you understand the gravity of the situation,\" said the lovely man at Scotland Yard. Despite his unwarranted aggravation with me, I could have listened to him talk all day. Swoon. I continue to be fascinated with the diversity of accents on my visit here in England.\"Oh no officer, I understand very well that you believe I was being a menace. But I don't understand why. Maybe it's this heat wave – it has you a bit tense.\" I was trying to lighten the atmosphere.He did not smile at me, and in fact started looking like a menace his own self. His fleshy cheeks (or are they jowls? I think jowls, yes!) were quivering. I wondered if I should mention that he might consider ignoring his sweet tooth every now and then. Perhaps not, at this particular moment.\"Listen, officer, all I was trying to do was save the flowers from that killer! I was minding my own business on a tour of Buckingham Palace & I saw him – he was tramping all over the place with loppers and headed straight for the tulips. I just knew that something tragic would happen!\"\"Ms. Bug,\" (this through clenched teeth), \"surely you could see that he was the gardener just doing some pruning. And he wasn't anywhere near the flowers! There was no justification for you tackling him and putting him in a headlock. You assaulted the man!\"\"Well, sure, I know now, but at the time I thought I was saving the Queen's tulips. God save the Queen's tulips?\" With a scowl he marched stiffly from the room. Oh no, there was going to be no amity here. Apparently I was in real trouble. Now here I sit in a small room awaiting my fate. These could be my final hours! Well, possibly just my final hours in England. Sigh. I could sure use old Rumpole about now. Or maybe his wife Hilda – she seems to have been more of a shark than he was. Please note – I've never watched the Rumpole television show, but I've read several of the books that came after. Delicious! They are so much fun. I highly recommend them. Please go to Raven's blog to read the other Wordzzle participants. And join in – it can be addictive!"},
{"title": "A Post that isn't a Poem or a Story, and Contains no Pictures", "date": "Friday, July 16, 2010", "text": "Warning – I have a lot of things to say today. You might want to read this in shifts.Boy it feels like it’s been forever since I’ve written a blog entry that wasn’t a poem, a story, or a list of pictures. Well, there was this one from Tuesday. But the one before that was at the end of June. Let’s see, I do the Wordzzle, the Magpie (sometimes), the Poetry Bus, Project 365, and now I’m doing the One Shot Wednesday . Hmm – that’s five different memes. At least this week I’m combining the Wordzzle and the Poetry Bus. You know, I was hoping this blog would reopen that room where all my words had been shoved. But I was thinking more of inviting them along on a toe-dipping session in a kiddie pool – not an all day swim in the ocean. It’s been interesting feeling like I’m on a deadline (a flexible one, fortunately) and I think that the results have varied. But it’s fun! I started this post thinking that I would be talking about dropping one of the poetry memes, but I think I’ll probably keep doing it as long as it’s fun. I feel like I should apologize to someone for this…but I most likely won’t.OK, on to the REAL drivel.I have an appointment with my eye doctor this afternoon. We have both been so pleased with the results of my lasik surgery over five years ago. I was blinder than a bat (I didn’t have any of that radar stuff to help me get around). Without my contacts I literally couldn’t see that there was a monitor on this desk, much less tell that there might be words on the monitor. Well, there would have been a squarish blur that I probably would have surmised was a monitor (is that radar?). Anyway, at the time of the surgery I was 40 & my eye doctor warned me that I would probably need reading glasses at some point – sooner than if I had not had the surgery. And I believe that day has finally arrived. I can still see to read books – it’s the tags in my clothes that are giving me fits. And that tiny little label on the nail polish bottle (what if I was supposed to do something different other than put the polish on my nails? I’ll never know!). My left eye is very different from my right eye, so I’ll need prescription reading glasses. We’ll see if he recommends them today. I’ll keep you posted!I’m doing just ok with the PYMWYMI challenge (um, Amy, maybe we need a new acronym?). I’ve cut back on the diet soda and I’ve been eating a lot more healthfully (there may have been cookies on Wednesday – but we won’t speak of it). I have not exercised. Anne suggested dancing and I mentioned that I dance a lot like Elaine on Seinfeld (if you don’t know what that looks like, just go to youtube & type in Elaine from Seinfeld dancing – you can’t miss it). I think that perhaps you would burn MORE calories dancing in that non-rhythmic way. Dr. M – consider this your warning that things could get QUITE ugly at the Bug household!During the summer our choir has a hiatus, and members of the choir sing solos instead. I did not offer my services because I don’t have anything in particular that I sing. But last Sunday the choir director said that people had been asking for me to sing. And I don’t know why I don’t really believe her, but singing and writing are areas where I just don’t really believe compliments. I know – it’s something a good therapist could help me with. (And here I am tearing up for this poor little kid who doesn’t think anything she does is special – I don’t want to be that kid!). Anyway, when I mentioned the lack of solo material she suggested that I sing a hymn. So I’ve been driving Dr. M crazy trying to pick one out. So many of the ones from my Baptist childhood are all about the blood – and I just don’t want to sing about that. I have it narrowed down to three, but I think that I might go with this one. It’s kind of the crux of my politics. If we aren’t helping Jesus with the task of caring for the poor, needy, weak, wounded, thirsty, ruined… well why are we here anyway?I Will Arise and Go to JesusCome ye sinners, poor and needyWeak and wounded, sick and soreJesus ready stands to save youFull of pity, love and powerRefrainCome ye thirsty, come and welcomeGod’s free bounty glorifyTrue belief and true repentanceEvery grace that brings you nighRefrainCome ye weary, heavy ladenLost and ruined by the fallIf you tarry till you’re betterYou will never come at allRefrainI will arise and go to JesusHe will embrace me in His armsIn the arms of my dear SaviorO, there are ten thousand charmsCome back tomorrow to see a sordid tale of unhealthy love – and a trip to Scotland Yard!"},
{"title": "One Shot Wednesday – Ode to a Grapefruit", "date": "Tuesday, July 13, 2010", "text": "Ruth's post about Quinoa reminded me of this little gem – written around 1987 or so. Next week I'll try to remember to write something new. Ode to a GrapefruitAh! Humble Fruit – I sing to TheeWith perfect past'ral Modesty.I sing Your Virtues – clear to MeIn Moments of Senility.When on Thy rounded perfect OrbMy Eyes alight, They do absorbAn unparagoned Creation of Our Lord – Which leaves Me quite without a Word.Thy sly ambrosial Juice that squirtsInto My Eye in vicious spurts – That hidden sour Taste that lurks – Are just, indeed, but trifling Quirks.And so in Moments of ReposeFancy flies and I composeA lilting Ode that fairly glowsWith Love for that \"Most Precious Rose\"…The Grapefruit!Ok, I know, this is a picture from 2007 of me being cold, but this is also the face I make when I eat grapefruit!This poem is part of One Stop Poetry's One Shot Wednesday poetry gathering, where all poets are welcome to share. Leslie (Moondustwriter) is this week's host. Make the rounds – it will no doubt be fascinating!I don't want to blog about this. I'm actually quite tired of the subject. However, Amy at All Things A Ro has issued a challenge and I just can't let it go.As many of you know, I really struggle with eating healthfully. I crave sweets and I often don't make the most healthy meal choices either. And the more I read about artificial sweeteners, the more I think that my Kroger Big K Diet Citrus Drop is sabotaging me. I know, I know, they've been talking about it for years, but I've ignored it. But now I'm actually paying attention to how I feel while I'm drinking the Drop. And what I feel is – where's the rest of my food? I have more drink left, but I'm out of food. Alternatively, I'll think that I want a drink, but I can't have it without also eating something. For some reason, I'm not sure why, but that just doesn't sound right to me.I also struggle with moving my body. Some days it's a literal struggle – the old hip is wonky, or my foot hurts, or my shoulder is bugging me. But most of the time it's just inertia that's keeping me down (in my chair, in front of this very computer). My dad likes to say of me sometimes, \"for such a smart person you sure can be dumb.\" It's true! Despite incontrovertible evidence that eating right & exercising are overwhelmingly to my benefit, I sit, eating bonbons (not literal bonbons – at least not recently). So, here comes Amy Ro with a challenge. She says: Every day that I get up to exercise I will donate one dollar to the Special Olympics.  Every day that I eat without gluttony and choose healthy options and have a healthy attitude towards food I will donate one dollar to my local food pantry.  It is a win win situation.  I will become more thankful for my blessings, I'll be able to help others who aren't as fortunate, and I will become a stronger healthier person...not to mention some tax write offs at the end.Well heck Amy, that's just entirely too healthy of a goal for you to have on your own. So I'm joining you darn it. You can tell I'm very excited. Sigh. Truth be told, I would rather just do whatever I want to. But somewhere deep inside, my (actual) heart (muscle) is saying, \"At last!\"I don't want to disappoint it. Or let Amy earn more bucks than me (she will anyway – she's disgustingly disciplined). Join us if you dare!"},
{"title": "Weekly Wordzzle", "date": "Monday, July 12, 2010", "text": "Words for this week's 10-word challenge are: smoothly, spiders, floor boards, eggs, carpet, moonshine, leaping, CD, purring, jewel And for the mini: spotlight, canvas, kitty, money-box, eye-dropsI decided that I like using all the words in one story best - probably because I'm too lazy to write more than one LOL. Go to Raven's blog to check out the other participants.Uncle David wouldn't take an IOU for the kitty, so I was at loose ends Saturday night. I didn't really feel like playing poker anyway. Much. I decided to just chill & listen to my new CD by the Moonshine Mountain Boys. But then the phone rang, propelling me toward a destiny I would never have dreamed could be mine.Adam had a plan. He'd heard a rumor about a fabulous jewel hidden in an abandoned building near the old foundry. He wanted to head over there right away and check out the place. I asked Adam who had given him the tip about the jewel. He said he overheard Kevin Lackey talking to someone else about it. Kevin Lackey. Seems like he had a grudge against Adam, but I couldn't remember exactly. Anyway, I wasn't excited about pulling up floor boards in a dusty old building - all on the chance that a tale told in a bar could be true. But the Moonshine Mountain Boys weren't really doing it for me, so I went. I packed two hard-boiled eggs and my eye-drops - just in case this took all night.The building was even more dilapidated than I expected. In fact, I'm not sure there were any floor boards left in the place. I watched Adam smoothly leaping up onto a beam and decided that I was more comfortable down on the ground with the spiders. Well, maybe not comfortable exactly. Fact was I wasn't exactly comfortable about any of this. I stayed put on a small square of tattered carpet.Adam called out from somewhere over my head, \"Hey - bring the flashlight! I want to you to spotlight this hole in the wall.\" Obediently I clambered not smoothly up to where he was & shone the light. It didn't help much, but barely visible was a canvas bag shoved haphazardly into the narrow space. Adam pulled the bag out & after looking inside he pulled out an ancient money-box. We were getting pretty excited at this point. A money-box! Maybe there was a fortune in cash and jewels in there!Of course it was locked. We decided to take it back to my place to see if we could pick it. We had started climbing down to the first floor when Adam asked, \"Do you hear purring?\" Yeah, I heard purring. We looked around and finally realized that the sound was coming from the box. Except that now it didn't sound like purring, exactly. And that's the last thing I remember. Now I'm in a small room with some other people who look as dazed as I feel. I don't see Adam anywhere. Oh, here, they're calling my name - \"Peter will see you now.\""},

One of the things we like to do up there is visit Johnson's Island. It served as a Confederate prisoner of war camp during the Civil War. There is a graveyard there for the men who died in the camp. Dr. M took a picture of the new marker listing the names of the dead, by state. You can see the two of us reflected in this picture. My grandmother's maiden name was Hilton – I wonder if this soldier is an ancestor of mine? That evening we staked out our places on the dock at our hotel so we'd be in good position to watch the Cedar Point fireworks. I used some of the bird pictures we took that evening on my post the other day – Erie Images. Here are pics of some of the fireworks. We weren't very close – which suited me just fine – I don't like loud noises!Monday, July 5thWe drove home on Monday. I took lots of pictures of the fields we passed – tomatoes, corn, soybeans, wheat. Most of them are pretty blurry, including this one. But I kind of like it anyway – so you have to look at it too. Tuesday, July 6thOn Tuesday Dr. M took a picture of one of our cucumber blossoms. I will be doing a whole separate post sometime about how this cucumber plant has plans for world domination – it is OUT OF CONTROL. I haven't seen Despicable Me, but from what I've heard I think the cucumber might have minions any time now.Wednesday, July 7thOn Wednesday Dr. M took a picture of one of the really lovely yards he passes on his way home from school. It's in the town of Yellow Springs. It's a fascinating little town – a kind of hippie mecca. And a place to find beautiful flowers.He also captured this picture of a red-tailed hawk.Thursday, July 8thOn Thursday Dr. M took some updated pictures of our garden. We're going to have a lot of banana peppers & tomatoes! Friday, July 9thSpeaking of tomatoes – I took a picture of our first ripe grape tomato from the Topsy Turvy plant. For perspective, I posed it next to a regular tomato we bought on our way home from the lake on Monday.Saturday, July 10thToday we went to the Clifton Gorge for a mini hike. Although the temps are much lower today than they have been, it was still quite steamy. Or maybe it was just me with my makeup melting… Well we know for sure that Dr. M's makeup wasn't melting.

The challenge is to write a poem on something. Literally. You really do need to go to his blog to see the examples he gives – they're worth the simple click of your mouse. So here is my attempt. I took a picture of one of our daisies (after a fabulous refreshing storm), printed the picture, and wrote my poem on the picture. I seriously toyed with the idea of picking the flower & actually writing on the petals – but I decided not to sacrifice it to this cause. The menacing looks from Dr. M. may have had something to do with that. Heh. My handwriting is fairly hit or miss, so the poem is posted below the picture.

It was the Bugly's first trip to the castles.I also took yet another picture of the finches at the feeder.Thursday, July 1stOn Thursday we drove up to Marblehead Ohio to enjoy some time at Lake Erie. Before we left I basically guilted Dr. M into picking this banana pepper from our garden. Our first produce! It was a bit bitter - I'm pretty sure we picked it too soon.I took not one picture on our way to the lake. And once we got there we were so wiped out from the sun that we basically strolled around the resort grounds & came to the room to get on the computer before crashing. Here's Dr. M in the room.

Here is a picture that a nice lady on the ferry took of the two of us.On our way back to our hotel we stopped at the Marblehead Lighthouse - we always check it out when we come up here.Saturday, July 3rdToday we just decided to ramble around. We went to Maumee Bay State Park & walked around looking at the birds & the bathers. Then we went to the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge & took their boardwalk through the marsh. It was very pleasant (except for some biting flies). Here I am enjoying the marsh:On our way back to the hotel we stopped at one of our favorite places - East Harbor State Park.

I’m impatient!The Tax Time Pig has had a stuffed Saint Bernard sitting on its back all week. Rather than take a picture I thought I’d just let you envision that. There wasn’t a sign so I’m not sure what exactly this portends. I appreciated all the positive responses to my poem about the Ohio Cornfield Prostitute. I have really pondered the meaning of the sign and I’ve decided that the most likely scenario is some sort of feud between two people of the female persuasion & one of them posted this not-so-subtle hint about the character of the other one. Anyone else have any other ideas?Although I’m not a prostitute, I did have some ice cream on Sunday. I had Cow Patty flavor. Dr. M had boring old chocolate (he will tell you that it was excellent - & on sale!).You may notice that I tend to link to old posts a lot. This is not primarily to get you to go read old posts (although it’s a nice side benefit). I’m just too lazy to say everything again. On my way to work this morning I was composing a soliloquy about how much I enjoy my commute on pretty days, but then I hit the interstate portion of the journey & started cussing. Took the charm right out of the journey. It’s because I’m listening to music instead of audio books. Music does not soothe this savage beast!My music playlist is rather eclectic. I’ve got Sheryl Crow, Indigo Girls, Jonatha Brooke, Ingrid Michaelson, John Gorka, Eric Clapton, Michelle Shocked, Annie Parsons, Dixie Chicks, Allison Krauss, Bruce Hornsby, Tom Petty, Eliza Gilkyson, Lucy Kaplansky, Richard Shindell, Marc Kohn, Girlyman, The Wailin’ Jennys, Suzy Boggus, Bonnie Raitt, some others I can’t remember, and… Sarah Vaughn. Now I really love Sarah Vaughn. But. Mixed in with these other artists? With all those orchestral arrangements? It’s just anachronistic. She makes me think of Carol Burnett singing some parody or other. In future I’ll save Sarah for my Rosemary Clooney/Patricia Barber mix. Tomorrow Dr. M & I are heading up to Lake Erie. We’re staying in the town of Marblehead. Marblehead has charm, fishermen, & mayflies (I’m actually hoping the mayflies are gone by the time we get up there). We mostly like to just sit & watch the water & take pictures of the ducks. I’m sure you’ll hear all about it later! I may or may not post while we’re gone – if not, I’ll see you guys on Tuesday!"},

The troupe was written up in the local paper & daddy was quoted. Always a terrifying moment for me. You just never quite know what will come out of his mouth. The troupe is called the Encore players, made up out of \"55ish\" and older actors. The name of the play is \"The Perils of Precious Penelope or Keep Your Temper(ance) in Check.\" Everyone involved is apparently having a blast - & the reporter enjoyed watching the rehearsal. The actors in these productions read from their scripts instead of memorizing their lines – which actually makes the melodrama even funnier. My dad says that's ok with him because, his memory never was as good as it used to be. Heh. In the article, daddy said about retirement and getting older, \"Let's let them know that retirement isn't just fishing and playing with the grandkids,\" he says. \"It's about getting out and having a life of your own.\" Which I find really funny because I don't know when he last fished (Was it that trip down to Santee Cooper when Joe thought Uncle Bill was a bear? Was that even at Santee Cooper?). He should have said that retirement isn't just about golf & gardening – those are his passions.I think it's great that he's playing an evil villain.

I am not super excited by either of them, but this is a learning process. Go to Raven's blog to see the other folks' offerings – in general they're more talented than I am (you must check out Argent's Harold series). The mini: eeeeek a mouse!, span, spurn, choose me, geese Through the window I see the geese form an imperfect V in the sky – they're missing one to make it even. I'm lost in thought, imagining the fate of the missing goose. In my sadness I forget my mantra: pleasedon'tchoosemepleasedon'tchooseme – and I get picked for the game. I notice that I was only picked because I was the last one left. Most of the other players know my \"skill\" and spurn me. Sigh. Why can't I be left alone with my books? I wonder, if I screeched, \"eeeeek a mouse!\" could I sneak out the back door? I'd probably just get pulled back. Sigh. I look at the span of time before me – how much longer until I can steer clear of these games forever? Let's see, my daughter is 6. So, that's another 5 years of elementary school. Triple sighing, I say, \"Why yes, I accept my nomination for the position of Home Room Parent Coordinator.\" The 10-word: ear phones, sleeping, honest to goodness, lawn mower, cinnamon, matches, antibiotics, congregation, flower pot, cheeseI am ear phone incompetent – how do you keep those ones on little wires in your ears? I need some honest to goodness actual headphones instead. Disgusted, I toss them into the flower pot just inside the front door – the one with keys, matches & twist ties, not the one with an actual flower in it. I've just finished doing my biweekly dance with the lawn mower (I wish it would learn to let me lead!) and I'm feeling peckish. One brown sugar cinnamon pop tart with melted cheese later and I feel somewhat human again. Checking the messages, I see one from my doctor's office. I've been having trouble sleeping. Every night there's a whole congregation of people in my head having a conversation – that doesn't include me. They talk around me, not to me. Some nights it's about how I should have stood up for myself at work. Other nights it's about why I think a brown sugar cinnamon pop tart with melted cheese is a good snack. These people are making me crazy. I'm hoping an antibiotic will do the trick.The message from the doctor is short & to the point: \"Ms. Bug, after reviewing your tests I have come to the conclusion that you are not physically ill.

{"title": "Considering Last Night's Dream", "date": "Wednesday, June 23, 2010", "text": "In my dream, my mother is downstairs waiting for me. She’s probably ironing. I don’t remember what was going on in the dream – I had to finish doing something before I could go down to talk to my her. I had a question to ask her. I wonder what the question was? Even as I dream I think, “Remember this!” But I awaken and it fades away while I grasp at wisps. I can almost see them floating away. Today I’m thinking about the dream & remembering a pair of pants folded over a chair – they need ironing in the worst way. I’m wondering if I will do that task tonight, and if I will wash the sheets, and maybe dust as well. I’m also wondering if my reluctance to do these tasks is more than just sloth on my part. Am I rebelling against my mother when I don’t keep a tidy house? She’s been gone five years. In addition, I am forty six years old. I think it’s time for all the demons buried in my psyche to just grow up already. But the dream wasn’t about housekeeping. I’m pretty sure. It was probably about the accumulation of five years worth of things to tell my mother. Only my subconscious really knows. I wish my subconscious was a little more forthright. I’m kind of a literal girl. At this rate it could take eons before I know what’s going on - & by then we’ll be on a whole other topic. I wonder what I’ll dream about tonight? Probably about booking an appointment with a therapist!"},

We were looking for some daylilies to plant along the side of the house, but didn't want to spend $6 a pop on them. For today, we decided to get some of this Marigold Lemon Gem. The flowers are edible – I'm going to try some in a salad tomorrow. We've put six of them on the borders of one of our garden boxes. We took lots of pictures – I'm going to do a \"yard\" post on Tuesday. Dr. M bought a birdbath for me – I think it's gorgeous! He read that it helps cut down on algae if you put some copper in the water. I generously donated a bracelet I got in Zambia to the cause. It's made out of the copper byproduct from silver mining.

{"title": "Weekly Wordzzle Challenge - Week 114", "date": "Friday, June 18, 2010", "text": "So I decided to try the Weekly Wordzzle again. And again I'm apparently too greedy to just use some of the words & have THREE stories – I have to use them all and just have one story. I think my goal next week might be to actually do at least two separate stories. We'll see. Go to Raven's blog to check out the other participants.The 10-worder: Cleopatra, Saturday, perfume, suicide, guaranteed satisfaction, germs, stop in the name of love, Swiss cheese, cheap, luggageThe mini: gratitude, shadows, sufferin' succotash, flattery, pigletOut of the ShadowsSaturday lunch with Cleopatra – an appointment I wasn't allowed to miss. My grandmother is a bit of a drama queen. Once, when I was leaving she sang out, \"Stop in the name of love,\" as I looked at her in disbelief. Fortunately she didn't sing the rest of the song.  Today I was dragging – sleepless nights and dark thoughts were my travelling companions. The last thing I wanted to do was spend an hour with my nutty grandmother. Lunch was the same as always – strong perfume, Swiss cheese and ham sandwiches, and a discussion of whether hand sanitizer really killed germs as advertised. \"Guaranteed Satisfaction\" was a call to arms for my Gran Cleo. She didn't believe in flattery or guarantees. As usual, she had to tell the story of how she came to the city with just some cheap luggage and a piglet under her arm (I never could figure out what she meant to do with the piglet). She said, \"Sufferin' succotash Bug, I thought I had landed in the mouth of hell itself!\"  I said, \"Yes, Gran, and you had to walk to work uphill, both ways, in four feet of snow.\" \"Well, no, Bug – that's not physically possible. But those were dark days. I felt as though I lived in shadows. I was alone with no friends & what felt like no hope for the future. In shadows and far from home.\"I'd not heard this part of the story before. \"What happened to make it better Gran?\"\"A girl I knew from work committed suicide. For some reason that made so much sense to me. And I wondered if I would be next. I even bought a knife with a sharp blade to do the deed. But then I decided that I was just too nosy to leave this world without finding out what happens next. It was like starting a book & then putting it down half read. How would I know if the girl in 2C was really pregnant? What if I missed the flying cars & living on the moon? What if my ship came in & I wasn't there to greet it? I decided to finish the book. I shook off those shadows and went on with my life. Then I met your grandfather and he made the whole city shine like a freshly cut diamond. The diamond he gave me is what gets me through these days without him. And you – you get me through those days too – even if you don't care for my singing.\"As I left that day I gave her the usual hug – but there was something extra. Gratitude for a story told right when I needed to hear it. When I got home that night I flushed my hoard of sleeping pills down the toilet and slept like a baby."},
{"title": "Feed My Sheep", "date": "Thursday, June 17, 2010", "text": "Dr. M is guest posting this morning. I read his homily regarding the giant Jesus statue on Facebook last night and immediately asked if I could steal use it on the blog. He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. John 21:16Let me begin by saying that my grandfathers, one a Baptist preacher, the other a Baptist deacon, would simply be aghast at the idea of ANY statue of Jesus associated with an evangelical church! Worshipping graven images is a violation of the Second Commandment, and my grandfathers took all those pesky Commandments very seriously. No graven images = no temptation to worship them, and so we had no graven images…not even a crucifix! Alas, my grandparents were products of an older age, still clinging to the remnants of radical Protestantism, knowing what they believed and why they believed it. They were descended from Lutheran and Reformed or Presbyterian traditions, but drawn to the Baptist church by its local church autonomy, simple liturgy, and emphasis on The Word. They sang the old evangelical hymns, read the Bible with zeal, and, for the most part, practiced what they preached. As I have grown older, I have found it fascinating being an \"insider\" in Preacher Friday's family: his children (my mother, aunts, and uncle) often resented his selfless nature. They resented that they would never have much of anything in terms of material possessions, because their father would literally give the shirt off his back to someone in need. He preached many years for small congregations, lucky sometimes to get much more than a Sunday meal for his efforts. Though he loved Jesus with all his being, I dare say that never, ever, in his wildest fantasies, did he envision an evangelical church that would think it appropriate to build a six-storey statue of Jesus, King of Kings!You see, that's precisely the point here: my grandfather did not worship King Jesus! He worshipped God. Yes, he believed in the Trinity, and like most Trinitarians struggled to wrap his mind around the whole \"father, son, spirit, yet one God\" concept. He believed that Jesus, as part of the Trinity, was the son of God, the Christ, and his personal savior. Preachers of his generation knew the difference between proclaiming Jesus as Lord and worshipping a false god: King Jesus. They served and ministered to people because that was God's will for their lives, and they had sense enough to know that the Lord's work did not involve building giant Jesus statues!Unfortunately, over the last several decades far too many evangelical ministers and their congregations have lost touch with their Protestant roots and with the basic mission to which they should be called. It is not that they invented the Cult of King Jesus; no, far from it...that cult is many centuries old. What they have done is to convince themselves that what God wants from them is to shout the name of Jesus at the top of their lungs, to shock the world into realization that Jesus is King of Kings and Lord of Lords. In screaming the name of Jesus over and over and over again in oh, so many ways, they seemingly strive to shout him down from the heavens, no doubt in the form of the Second Coming they so eagerly await. What these ministers seemingly fail to understand is that, with the din and clamor over King Jesus, they have drowned out the still, small voice of God, whose son they claim to be praising. Moreover, they have strayed from the path of humble service to which all Christians should be called. And so we have the story of the giant Jesus just off of I75, built by a wealthy former horse trader turned minister. How on earth can one reconcile this statue with the church as revealed to us in the New Testament? You know the one: the church Glen Beck rants against, the one that cares for the poor, divests itself of wealth, seeks to serve, keeps a low profile, and yet grows by leaps and bounds precisely because it is true to its calling! Admittedly, this whole bigger Jesus than thou thing is an extension of the quest to prove one's piety by building bigger stuff than thy neighbor. History bears witness to this in the form of the quests to build the ultimate cathedral, the world's largest crucifix, etc. Having grown up a radical Protestant, I can blame much of this on misguided \"high church\" types ;-) and, more recently, woefully misguided televangelists. Folks, the bottom line is this: one does not earn God's favor or approval by building a giant cathedral, or a giant crucifix, or a giant cross, or a giant Jesus. Do you love Jesus? Then feed his sheep! It really is that simple, folks. Feed the sheep...all the sheep, for we are all HIS, according to scripture. No building of Big Butter Jesuses, no gaudy, ghastly displays, no bowing at the feet of King Jesus instead of worshipping the Lord Most High. If you love God, care for God's lambs. That's what Jesus would do...indeed, to the best of our knowledge, that's what the historical Jesus and his faithful followers actually did!However, one most certainly CAN stray from the mission of the church, one can SQUANDER the bounty of a given congregation or the faithful masses, and thus one can SIN AGAINST GOD! If you want to prove your love for God, then follow God's commandments. That's the name of the game, straight from the source: Jesus. By all appearances, it is far easier to build giant cathedrals or Jesuses than it is simply to follow God's commandments.And so in the case of the Solid Rock Church and its leadership, I am greatly disappointed. While I am sure that this church does many positive things, I must challenge their decision to spend so much money on the giant Jesus, which they now plan to rebuild! Solid Rock, if your church is founded on what you say it is, Christ, the Solid Rock, then you need to demonstrate your love of God by doing what Jesus Christ asked of you."},

I'm not fishing for compliments people – just telling it like it is. I'm a cynic. It's ok – it certainly won't stop me from singing again!I'm going to whisper here because I'm afraid to say it out loud, but I'm trying again to be healthier. I'm doing Weight Watchers this time because it has worked well for me in the past. I'll keep you posted.I'm listening to another audio book that's driving me crazy. I'm pretty sure it will end well (Fern Michaels doesn't usually disappoint), but I might have to murder the main character before that point. I'm sure people who've seen me driving this past week are wondering why I hate my steering wheel – I keep banging on it going, \"no, no, no!\" I'm going to have to go back to listening to Lillian Jackson Braun – Jim Qwilleran does NOT annoy me as a main character.I am going to have to vacuum again. It's not even been three weeks – what's up with that? And frankly I should have vacuumed LAST weekend. I've heard tell that some people vacuum on a weekly or even daily basis, but I don't think I believe it.I finally pulled out my summer clothes & put the turtlenecks away. I only did it because I was smothering every time I saw them – can't even IMAGINE wearing a turtleneck right now. Otherwise I would have just made do with my jeans & the five t-shirts I leave out for winter. Turns out I have actual shorts and capris to wear for summer. I helped Dr. M mow the lawn this evening**. I actually started the mower on my own! The last time I tried I had no success – but it turns out that it was out of gas. I was going to check that very thing, but Dr. M has a grip of steel & I couldn't get the gas cap off. Anyway, now that I know I can start it myself I might surprise him by mowing sometimes. Might. Anyway, boy was my face red. Really – I wasn't embarrassed, just beet red from the exertion. I could blame my out-of-shapeness, but I've been this way my whole life – my body doesn't have a very efficient cooling system. I took a picture but I'm just not that shameless tonight – it's pretty rough. Instead, I'll leave you with this lovely lane we drove down last weekend. *Every paragraph but the first one starts with \"I\" - & the first one is just trying to be cute or it would start with \"I\" too.

I don't know why, but this phenomenon fascinates me. Saturday, June 12thThis morning it was pouring rain (which did not stop me from harvesting some cilantro for our breakfast omelet – well, it wasn't pouring when I did that).

I chose the second option:Option II: What's in a Name?Your name (first or surname) often reflects your life's path. For this option, find the etymology of your name and consider the many ways that meaning reflects your life. Then, write about it.I was highly amused at some of the meanings of my name, which caused me to not take the poem too seriously.

Well that just puts a cap on my night – why did I walk? Here's the charter member of the artist's fan club. His mother. Does she know we had a fling in their pool house one evening last June? An indiscretion involving whipped cream and some rather vigorous flirting on my part after watching him cut a rug with some gorgeous creature. Not one of my finer moments. If she knew she'd probably read me chapter & verse about his excellent prospects and my rather lackluster self. It's one of the universal laws – no one is ever good enough for a mother's son. With all the gravity I can muster I say, \"You know, ma'am, it was just the one time. I'm not really interested in your son.\" Pregnant pause. One eyebrow lifted. \"You know, young woman,\" she said, \"you should perhaps go more sparingly on the gin next time.\" I said, \"I don't even like gin.\" And promptly fell over sideways, bellowing \"It's not the alcohol – I'm just a klutz!\"***My mortification complete, I walk home in the rain, shoes in one hand, the other waving to the people I see on the street.

Gorgeous!Tuesday, June 1stOn Tuesday we reacquainted ourselves with our plants. Aren't the tomato plants lovely? You'll see them again in the Saturday pictures.And here are some of our pansies & the begonias. We were so impressed with how well they did while we were gone. They were saying, \"Oh no! The watering man is back! Make him go away again!\" Dr. M tends to have a heavy hand with the watering can (as you can see from the water droplet on one of the begonia blossoms).Wednesday, June 2ndOn Wednesday I came home to a new hanging basket.

This week he bought kits to make these raised beds. I can't wait to see everything grow! He's already moved the tomato plants into one & put some bell pepper plants in the other. Today we found some cilantro (after I realized that cilantro & coriander are the same thing. Duh.). Aren't the boxes lovely?And at long last we've put a tomato plant in the Topsy Turvy. We bought the plant while we were out looking for cilantro. We figured it would be a while before our seed grown tomato plants would be ready so we wanted something that might have tomatoes sooner. When we moved into this house I had a dream of growing my own tomatoes. Now I think it might actually come true – sort of (in that Dr. M is pretty much doing all the growing). I'll help eat them though!Go here to see the blogs of all the other Project 365 participants."},

The Weaver of Grass is driving the Poetry Bus on Monday (yes, I’m tad early). She wants us to take a ramble in the countryside and write about nature. This is a bit of a cheat because it’s not exactly about nature, or I guess I should say that it’s not the poem I thought I would write. But it’s what came – and we all know how that is! And now the explanation is officially longer than the poem. So I’ll shut up now!Swimming that Dark SeaMy life goes on in endless songAbove earth's lamentations…Above would be nice.I thrust a hand upwardthrough the murk,the tips of my fingersfree,the knuckles of that handstraining toward a fresh hopeI can’t quite reach.Not quite.And earth’s lamentationscover me likea familiar quiltstitched together by ancient creationweeping, as it sews.Weeping.To read other Magpie entries go here.

Or at least I did it last week & I'm doing it this week. First – I PASSED MY NOTARY EXAM!! I know – I'm as shocked as you are. I love how they worded the letter: \"I will cause the successful application blanks to be signed…\" What if the application blanks were unsuccessful?Next – we went to North Carolina on Wednesday to see our families. We just got back yesterday & I am completely & totally behind on reading blogs. You will most likely not be getting comments from me this week (if you do get a comment it's because I FORGOT THAT I DON'T HAVE TIME). You will find this almost as shocking as me passing the notary exam – I had to actually work today instead of reading blogs. Apparently when you're out for three days (plus a holiday) work accumulates. Who knew? This is why there aren't any cute frames this week. Corners had to be cut. Sorry!OK – now onto the pictures for the week.Sunday, May 23rdOn Sunday I went to a multi-church gathering to watch three of our own be confirmed by the Bishop into the Episcopal Church. It was quite a dealio – LOTS of people from different churches were confirmed, & there was one baptism (the cutest little baby – I wish I had gotten a picture. As a former Southern Baptist I'm still not totally comfortable with infant baptism, but I enjoy the ceremony). Monday, May 24th Here's the weekly tomato update. Aren't they getting big? You should see them now (but you have to wait until next week – sorry).The neighbors got a puppy. His name is Hunter & he's really cute. I love how he looks like he's stalking something in this picture. Does he think he's a cat?Tuesday, May 25thOn Tuesday I spent a wonderful evening reading comics & blogs in the swing (after I vacuumed – blech).Wednesday, May 26thAfter I took my notary exam we headed south to see our families in North Carolina. Here's a highway picture. As you can see we have to drive through some awfully desolate country to get to NC. Heh.North Carolina knows how to treat its medians – poppies! It's one of my VERY favorite sights in the spring.Thursday, May 27thThursday we took so many pictures that I had a very difficult time choosing. The only thing that made my task easier was that I decided to do separate blog posts about our activities. Here's a sneak preview of one of them – we visited the butterfly exhibit at the Science Center.Daddy found a black snake taunting his dogs (from the other side of the fence of course). It caused much excitement, as you might imagine.Here is Amy working on some bread dough. You can tell she enjoys her task. Which reminds me, we totally forgot to bring any bread back with us. For shame!Friday, May 28thOn Friday I wandered around the \"farm\" & took some random shots. My one of the four leaf clover I found didn't turn out. Darn. Here is daddy on his Gravely (it's his baby).His new composter…Which he needs for this garden! Here you can see their garlic (which I thought was short corn), some viney thing (Beans? Okra? Tomatoes? Help me out here people!), lettuce (I ate some for breakfast yesterday – lettuce, strawberries, hardboiled egg, rotisserie chicken, pecans – it was pretty yummy), rhubarb and in the background their blueberries. We're going back later in the summer so we can participate in eating some more of the great stuff!Saturday, May 29thOn Saturday I went with Dr. M to visit his mother in the nursing home.

{"title": "His Name Was John", "date": "Monday, May 31, 2010", "text": "Daddy's wife Amy wrote this essay about her first husband for the Literary Arts section of the local Senior Games this year – she won the gold medal for her effort & is entering it in the state Games later this summer. I know I was impressed! I decided it was appropriate for Memorial Day.HIS NAME WAS JOHNArmy Serial # 14196510A True Experience of an American Prisoner of War in Germany World War IIHe walked, slowly and painfully, shuffling his tired, sore feet over the dusty ground, head bowed, eyes unseeing, just moving forward, always moving. His body was emaciated, covered with dirt and vermin, his clothes in rags, and boots worn thin. He was tired, so tired. It was tempting just to lie down and sleep for a time, but he knew he would be left to die. Some of his fellow prisoners had already fallen, too weak from hunger to go on. Hadn't his best friend dropped to the ground a few days earlier? Ignoring the guards order to move on, John turned back for his friend, carrying the limp body on his own tired shoulder until the soldier could walk again. How long had they walked? He couldn't remember, and there was no strength to dwell on anything but survival. Having endured months of interrogation, torture, cold, hunger, and fear, he would not allow the enemy to win now. After all, he was an American soldier, trained to survive in any situation, even as a dreaded prisoner of war. His shoulders straightened slightly and he moved forward with new resolve. He would survive!He was so hungry. He'd had nothing to eat for days. There was no food for anyone. His thoughts went back to the camp they'd left at Nuremburg, before their long walk into the German countryside. They'd had a little food then, a bit of moldy cheese, a raw turnip, and an occasional bowl of thin cabbage soup. How he hated cabbage! Once free, he vowed never to eat that vile tasting vegetable again. He took comfort from that decision. Glancing at the guards walking beside him, he realized that they were tired and hungry too. They were old men, too old to fight in combat, but they had guns and orders to keep the prisoners ahead of the American forces at any cost; thus the hurried movement with little sleep and less food. To help pass the time, John willed his mind to focus on earlier days in his life, before this war began. The images were vivid now. He could almost smell his mom's cooking, feel his warm bed, and see the farm with its vast corn fields, the earth warm beneath his bare feet. When he was older, he played on a semi-professional baseball team. He had a good pitching arm. There was an old car, friends, and enough money to enjoy life. The happiness he had known then surrounded him now like a warm blanket. Was it just three years ago? What had happened? Pearl Harbor! His country had been invaded by the enemy. Soon he volunteered for service, choosing the Army Air Corps. He'd always been fascinated by planes. His mind went back to the day he left for basic training, his mother's sad, tear-filled eyes and his father's rough face filled with pride as they said goodbye. He'd promised them he would return.For basic training, he was sent to Fort Bragg. Then came the rigorous routine – the skills needed for combat and survival, instilled with the mindset of a soldier, and then assignment to the elite crew of a B-24 heavy bomber. The crew was stationed in England, becoming part of the European Theatre of Operation. They worked as a close-knit team. Their mission – provide cover for allied ground troops and destroy enemy strongholds. As nose turret gunner, he was highly skilled and took pride in his abilities and in his B-24 bomber, which they had nicknamed \"Jest for Laughs.\" He remembered how they would fly out over the English Channel in the early morning fog, complete their assigned mission and fly back to base under the cover of darkness, often with just enough fuel to set down safely. They were aware of the danger involved, but nothing would happen to them. They were indestructible. Seeming to lead a charmed life, the \"Jest for Laughs\" and its crew had completed twenty six successful missions. Four more assignments and he would go home for a long furlough. It would be nice to be back on American soil in the safety of home and family for a change. Air raids, enemy fire, and exploding bombs were increasingly stressful. One day, his crew received orders for their next assignment. The briefing was detailed. If the mission went as planned, it could change the course of the war. The bombers would help clear the way for allied ground assaults, a massive invasion of strategic enemy strongholds. He knew the Germans were fierce and relentless opponents, but there was no doubt that the Americans would be successful. He was confident and ready.On Tuesday, June 20, 1944, in early morning, the crew left its base. They were all in place, John with his long frame folded into the nose turret. He could feel their strength and determination. They were a team with a single purpose. All was well.As the crew flew low over Politz, Germany their first bomb drop, he saw anti-aircraft fire. The sky around him was filled with a deafening sound. He felt a jolt as the big plane lurched to its side, then straightened slightly. One engine on fire, the bomber started a slow descent. At that time, the pilot gave the order to bail out. John's trap door was jammed. Pushing with all his strength, his head and shoulders emerged into the cockpit. Near the hatch lay the lifeless body of his co-pilot. There was no time! He was told again to jump. The pilot would go last. As the parachute opened, he looked below and saw German soldiers, their guns raised, following him down. He was scared, very scared. He saw his beloved \"Jest for Laughs\" in the distance as it exploded into flames. He knew the procedure. He would not divulge any information that would endanger even one fellow American soldier. He would only give his Army serial number. As his body hit the ground, he felt a searing pain in his leg. Looking down, he saw his pants leg soaked with blood. He had been wounded by flack.Next came the rough treatment, interrogation in a language he could not comprehend, punishment when he could not or would not answer, threat of imminent death, torture, and lies, lies, lies. Put in isolation, with little food or sleep, he was interrogated and punished daily. He was told repeatedly that the Americans would never look for him. He was presumed dead. He did not even have a name, only a number. Later, he and a dozen other prisoners were moved to a camp at Nuremburg and assigned to one small room. As staff sergeant, he was responsible for the group. Each day was recorded by a scratch on his wall, but these days were also etched in his mind. Had it really been ten months?One day, as he worked in the fields, John overheard a guard giving orders for the camp to move out quickly. The Americans were advancing ever closer. The war in Germany was coming to an end. German officers, however, were determined to keep the prisoners, as perhaps a bargaining tool. Very little time was needed for him to break camp. There were only the tattered filthy clothes on his back and a worn blanket which also served as his bed. He had no identification or any personal belongings. One thing he did have, however, was his determination to survive. The Germans could not take that from him. Just the fact that they were on the move was encouraging. He liked being out of that camp. Also, after months of infection in his leg, the flack wound had finally healed. He would never forget the kind German farmer who had wrapped the open sore in plantain, a leafy wild herb. The wound had healed quickly then. Walking was easier now. His body felt stronger and he had renewed purpose to stay alive until rescue came. He looked around at the sad, pathetic men who were left from his camp. They were so young, some only eighteen. He willed them to be strong and have courage.    A nearby noise got his attention. He turned to see that an old German guard had fallen, his rifle clattering on the ground. Without hesitation, John helped him stand again, picked up the rifle, took the man's arm and continued to walk. The other guards did not attempt to take the rifle from him. They were too tired to care.Planes were circling overhead – American planes. The prisoners waved in anticipation. Leaflets were dropped with the message that liberation was near. In minutes, John heard a loud rumble. He couldn't believe what he saw. Moving toward his pitiful group was a convoy of Army trucks. He was amazed as the trucks stopped in a cloud of dust. The 3rd Army had arrived. A few prisoners had been picked up from other camps and were already on board. He spotted the pilot and bombardier from his old crew. He felt his heart would explode with gratitude and relief.American soldiers jumped from the trucks to assist the prisoners, some of whom lay on the ground, too weak to move. Others crawled, walked, or ran toward the trucks. There was much laughter and tears. John stood, stunned, as the legendary General George Patton himself stepped down from the lead truck and walked toward him. Staff Sergeant John Sides, Army Air Corps, pulled himself erect and stood at attention to salute. Eyes moist with tears, General Patton said, \"At ease, soldier. What's your name and in what camp were you detained?\" John replied, \"Serial # 14196510, Sir!\" General Patton, grinning broadly, responded, \"I'm proud of you soldier, and I should be saluting you. Thank you! Now let's go home.\"John was overcome with emotion. He was safe now. It was over. He had fulfilled his duty as an American soldier. He had survived. The date was May 8, 1945. He was not yet twenty one years of age."},

{"title": "Hot Dog Heaven", "date": "Wednesday, May 26, 2010", "text": "Well, this morning I took my Notary Public test. I was very nervous. It was supposed to be an essay test & I never have very much to say. Heh. As I recalled from taking tests when I was in school a century eon many years ago, I was succinct almost to a fault. I had professors express amazement at my ability to answer the question in so few words. It worked well for me. Today I sat down to take my three page essay test and finished about 12 minutes later. Now I realize that maybe I'm just fabulous – but I suspect that in this case it means I didn't know enough to answer the questions fully. We'll see. I'll find out in about 2 weeks. If I don't pass I can take the test again next month.Once I pass the test I'm going to mail in the study guide they gave me. On every page I found about 5 – 10 typos. There were 19 pages – so that's almost 200 typos!! I think they had a hard copy of the document & scanned it in & used OCR software to turn it into a document they could edit (poorly) in a word processing program. It was very distracting and I plan to blame the typos if I don't pass the test. And then I'm going to offer to fix it for them. For a small fee.In other news, I passed this on the road today.Hot Dog Heaven. I'm skeptical. What do you think?"},

The singing was fine – I'm no Susan Boyle, but I'll do. When we practiced, the director asked if I had any more volume. I said, \"potentially.\" And I did when the time came. My jell-o salad was just ok – not much got eaten, but if you could have seen the spread they had you wouldn't have wanted the weird looking wobbly green stuff either LOL. The hard part was that, even though I didn't know the deceased, I was watching her daughter throughout the service. She was wrecked. And so was I. As the tears ran down my face I was thinking of my own mother. I was concerned that singing would be a problem, but in the end it wasn't. It did make me think that I don't want to sing at very many more funerals. Rough morning!OK – now onto the pictures for the week.Sunday, May 16thWe have our first blossoms from the wildflower seeds Dr. M planted in our front flower bed. We're very excited to see what all comes up.  Monday, May 17thTomato update! Dr. M put some of the plants in pots outside & kept these inside (we still don't trust our May weather just yet). I feel like such a proud mama.Tuesday, May 18thDr. M took a picture of a lamb in the twilight. It's a little spooky looking. Some of his Facebook friends called him Twi-Lamb, but one of them thought he was a Weresheep.Wednesday, May 19thDr. M took some more nature pictures on Wednesday. I was highly amused by the gray squirrel chasing the fox squirrel away.Here is a blue jay – I thought he got a nice shot.And I just love this flower picture!Thursday, May 20thOn Thursday the Twi-Lamb picture was freaking out too many people on Facebook, so Dr. M replaced that picture with this one of our sock monkey with a Serta Sheep in a half-nelson. It's Dr. M's summer break (although he's teaching one course a week right now), which means large amounts of silliness on Facebook. Can you tell?Friday, May 21stHere's the latest pig picture. I think the frog has a fishing pole. That made Dr. M & me think of the Crawdad Song :You get a line and I'll get a pole, Honey,You get a line and I'll get a pole, Babe.You get a line and I'll get a pole,We'll go fishin' in the crawdad hole,Honey, Baby mine.I also took a picture of the sky after a thunderstorm. I just thought it was cool looking.Saturday, May 22ndToday Dr. M surprised me by taking me to Lowe's to get a swing for our back yard. We had a nice time putting it together (I was #1 assistant).

{"title": "Gifts", "date": "Friday, May 21, 2010", "text": "Tomorrow our choir is singing for a funeral. I didn't know the lady who died, but I know how hard this moment is for her family. I'm singing one of the verses by myself (I hesitate to call it a solo because it's just a few lines in the middle of a song). We were going to sing this particular song for the first time the second Sunday of June. Plenty of time to practice. But now it's tomorrow.For some reason, 13 hours before the event, I feel less nervous than if we were singing it for Sunday morning. I think it's because the Sunday service is a time to showcase my \"talent\" – show them what I have (it's not really that much). But singing a song this family requested during their time of grief – it's a gift. I might not be perfect, but who cares? I'm a small cog in this day. I'll be singing as if I'm talking to those grown children about how we don't need to be afraid. I can do that.You need not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day. Though thousands fall about you, near you it shall not come. And he will raise you up on eagle's wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of his hand.On another note, I'm not afraid of singing (yet – ask me again at 9:55 tomorrow), but I am afraid of the age-old custom of bringing food to a funeral. The food coordinator said, \"Bring a salad – maybe a jell-o salad.\" I said, \"I do not cook. No problem!\" But then I remembered my Mom's lime jell-o salad from about a thousand church and family dinners. Apparently it was really Greatnanny's recipe. Here it is in the Brookford Baptist Church cookbook:I've made it. It's in the refrigerator congealing \"setting up.\" It's one of my very favorite things that my Mom always made. Another gift, but not from me. Thanks Mom."},
{"title": "Wednesday Random Dozen", "date": "Wednesday, May 19, 2010", "text": "The Random Dozen is hosted by Linda at 2nd Cup of Coffee. Go there to check out the answers other folks gave to these questions.1. What is one really fast, know-by-heart \"go-to\" meal to fix in a pinch? I don't cook, really, so it would be something VERY simple, like grilled chicken (on the Foreman grill – I don't mess with our outdoor grill), my dad's green beans & rice. We usually add bell peppers to the green beans. I know – very exciting!2. What is one item you won't leave home without. (Purse and license do not count.) My current audio book. If I am forced to listen to the radio I can't be held responsible for my driving actions. Really.3. Where is one place you never tire of visiting? My dad's house. Sure there are lots of other places I like to visit, but where else can I sleep in my old bedroom, eat Amy's cooking, and just hang out & do nothing? And if I need excitement I can head next door to my brother's house :) 4. Share one factoid of your family's history. My dad pointed out to me the other night that the village where my mom grew up is the only one with its name in the U.S. I did an internet search & I think he might be right. Brookford, North Carolina is one of a kind. And should perhaps remain that way Uncle David? Heh. It was a mill town – her parents worked in the mill & so did she when she grew up. It was a hosiery mill. I think she sewed socks. What's interesting to me is that although neither of his parents worked in the mill, Dr. M also grew up in a mill village. So instead of marrying my father, did I marry my mother? Hmmm – I think I should just stop this line of thought right now.5. Complete this sentence: \"Once upon a time I ....\" thought I would get into shape someday. I guess that could still happen.6. If you could win a one year's supply of anything, what would it be? Gasoline! I would say some food item, but I'm NOT a hoarder – I would just eat whatever it was until it was gone, which would be about three weeks months. 7. \"One quirky thing you may not know about me is ....\" I have to leave the room or cover my eyes when there's a lot of tension or scary stuff going on in a show I'm watching. Like, I remember when I was a kid, watching Little House on the Prairie, and the scene where Mary is in the tree with what's his name – I could NOT stay in the room. Just couldn't stand it. Now I don't remember why (was it their first kiss?). But I still do that. Dr. M laughs at me.8. You have one dollar in your pocket. What will you buy? Something chocolate I'm sure. Or a lottery ticket.9. \"One thing that always makes me laugh is ....\" The sheep I drive by every day. I don't know why – I just think sheep are funny. Or maybe that pig – that's pretty funny too.10. What is one thing you could do today to help yourself reach a personal goal? Exercise (see number 5 above). 11. What is one thing you could do today to bless someone else? Call someone I haven't talked to in a while. Or maybe the blessing would be if I don't call. 12. What is one thing you're looking forward to soon? Going to NC to see the family at the end of the month. I'll be staying at my favorite place!"},

The fugitive slave act meant that, while Ohio was a \"free\" state the runaway slaves couldn't stay there. Canada was their only hope for freedom. John Parker was more than just a freer of people - he was a former slave who had purchased his own freedom. He owned a foundry and held three patents. Five of his children graduated from college (his daughter Hortense was the first African American graduate of Mount Holyoke College).Parker wasn't the only conductor in Ripley - there were four (I think our docent said) on his street alone! And that didn't include Reverend Rankin who lived on \"Liberty Hill\" at the top of the 100 steps to freedom. Here is what he said about his work: \"My house has been the door of freedom to many human beings, but while there was a hazard of life and property, there was much happiness in giving safety to the trembling fugitives.

Here's my take.I got down on my knees and smelled the new linoleum.Its scent is un weary and miles away from the tension in the air.I appreciate its blue & white pattern and unmarred surface brieflybefore I sweep the shards into the bin, before I sink into that chair.What are these shards, exactly? I peer into their jumbleas if to read the leaves or perhaps only to read your mind.Blue & white, they match the floor and I wonder if I got them all or if I left a jagged edge for an unsuspecting foot to find.Is it cruel to wish it were your foot, the flinger of innocent dishware?The linoleum isn't weary, but I am weary of this battle wagedin a pretty kitchen with heirloom china and heirloom tempers – And no, don't smile at me – my fury will not be assuagedby love and laughter and sorry and I'll get the vacuum.Or maybe it will – I hate to vacuum and love watching the bentarm of my lover cleaning the anger from the new linoleum,now baptized with fire and impulse and the heat of the moment.To participate in Magpie Tales, or to read other entries (you won't be sorry!), just click here."},

I've been anticipating big changes at work which it appears will not happen.* Other than the helping in HR - that did happen - but isn't really a change per se. I'm all deflated. Not that I really knew what was coming down the pike. But it was going to be new! And different! The thing is that I love my job. So it staying the same is a good thing. Apparently I'm just craving change. I think this weekend at home I'll switch the blue filing cabinet with the cream colored one. I know! I think that's pretty radical too. I'll let you know how it goes.*In the interest of full disclosure I should say that any anticipation of change on my part was based entirely on my own fantasies and not on actual inside knowledge of said change."},
{"title": "This is just an excuse to show my high school graduation picture", "date": "Tuesday, May 11, 2010", "text": "I was answering the random dozen questions. I talked about what I wore to my high school graduation (white dress with turquoise polka-dots – I thought I was the stuff). I referenced my terribly cute penguin umbrella. I talked about how I tried to help Dr. M with the mowing, but after pulling the cord 10 times I gave up. But then I ran out of steam & bored myself. So I decided to spare you guys. You're welcome.Dr. M is teaching a class at a satellite campus this summer. One night a week – five hours. I'm pretty sure that he'll be tired of hearing himself talk after five hours. Pretty sure. He had his first class tonight. Two people were registered & one person showed up. Now that's some intense one-on-one teaching there. I actually did some exercise last night. I listened to my book on tape & used my Gazelle. And then my hip hurt extra so I was tossing & turning in bed. My arm has been hurting more lately too (opposite side from my hip). And if I'm on my back one of my knees starts hurting. So I'm thinking, you know that sling that they use for horses who've broken their leg & they're trying to save? I figure if we rig it just right I could have a comfortable night's sleep. But I will not let hip pain keep me from exercising – I think the key to easing that pain & the one in my knee is to get some weight off. My arm will just have to fend for itself.The Braves are last in their division. The Reds are second (behind those annoying Cardinals). So I feel like singing the song that legend says the British band played when they surrendered at Yorktown – The World Turned Upside Down.Dr. M & I are planning a trip south at the end of the month. It'll be nice to see the fam again. Hopefully our pictures from the journey won't have snow or flooding in them. Well, I'm sleepy & need to wrap this up. It's the 7th inning & the Braves are winning for a change. Woot!"},

He instructed us to pick a number from 1 to 14 (mine was 8) and then click on this link. He said that these photo archives are part of a larger project called The Commons on Flickr. He warned us to \"Be Careful! You could quite easily spend the rest of your day (and then some) browsing the visual riches therein.\" We were to go to the collection that matched our number & then go to the picture that matched our number.

{"title": "Wednesday Random Dozen", "date": "Tuesday, May 4, 2010", "text": "The Random Dozen is hosted by Linda at 2nd Cup of Coffee. Go there to check out the answers other folks gave to these questions.1. What was the last thing about which you procrastinated? I'm supposed to be cleaning out the office of one of the attorneys who left the company over two years ago. I look through a stack of papers in a desultory way about every two weeks. At this rate it'll be 2012 before I'm finished (and then the world will end!). At home we can always say that I'm procrastinating the vacuuming. Unless it's the actual day I've vacuumed or the six days after I've vacuumed – then I'm avoiding the vacuuming. 2. How long does it take you to fall asleep, and do you sleep through the night? I usually fall asleep within about 5 minutes of going turning the light out. Usually. Sometimes it takes longer. Like when I sleep until 10:30 in the morning & then try to go to bed a scant 12 hours later. I always wake up to go to the bathroom at least once during the night – often twice. But I have no trouble falling right back asleep. 3. Which decade would you choose to exemplify your favorite fashion styles? I'm not fashion-forward enough to know the answer to this question. The preppy look did nothing for my figure. And the hippie look, ironically, seemed to be for straight skinny people too. I think the sixties offered the most alternatives for a small-waisted, big hipped woman. 4. What is your personal best dish to feed a crowd? Me, feed people? Ha! Now, Dr. M has some good \"company\" dishes – BBQ pork & grilled chicken come to mind. I'll provide the pita & hummus. (Sabra brand – you didn't think I'd actually make it from scratch did you?)5. Are you an impulse shopper? What was the last thing you bought on impulse? I'm an impulse food shopper (Must. Stay. On. List. – ooh tiny little cartons of Skinny Cow Ice Cream!). But since I so rarely do other kinds of shopping I can't say that I'm an impulse shopper. I usually do the \"do I really need this\" test - & sometimes I say no & still get it – but I wouldn't call that an impulse buy after all that agony. 6. What is one wish you have for your own funeral? That I were still alive? Oh, not an option? I think that I would want the service to be whatever the folks who are left behind need for it to be. It's not for me – it's for them. 7. If it's true that joy is in found in the simple things in life, what does your joy look like today? Bright blue skies, boss in a good mood, Laughing Cow cheese, my Toms shoes… 8. What is your favorite type of bread? I'm not a huge bread eater (Give me chocolate people! No, not chocolate people. People! Give me chocolate!), but I do have an opinion. Mamaw's yeast rolls. Those evil biscuits at Red Lobster. Hushpuppies (are they not bread?).9. What trait do you fear developing the most? (Laziness, greediness, grumpiness, etc.) I already have all of those! Thanks, Lid for pointing out my faults… I think that I'm most afraid of losing my memory. I know that's probably not exactly a \"trait.\" But it scares me. I'm fairly forgetful already.10. What trait would you like most to develop? The opposite of those listed above! Vigor, selflessness, kindness…11. Which room in your house best reflects your personality? Why? The living room. There are a lot of uncompleted tasks, a bit of clutter, lots of blankets & a comfy pillow on the futon, my computer, and the TV where the baseball saves my sanity each night.12. How do you maintain balance in your life regarding, work, family, church, other organizations and activities, and blogging? I maintain balance by just not doing very much. I'm on the computer a LOT, but so is Dr. M. It's our family time together. My work gets left behind at work (I'm hourly so I can only work 40 hours a week anyway). Right now church is a one day a week gig – choir practice is after the service is over on Sunday. That could change if I get more involved. I do struggle to get the vacuuming in there since I'm so busy. Heh."},
{"title": "The World Keeps On…", "date": "Monday, May 3, 2010", "text": "Man, I hate being predictable. Well, that's not strictly true – I enjoy a good routine. But this business of being out of sorts. Crabby. Bloated. Uncomfortable in my own skin. I'd rather that not be routine. Four weeks ago I wrote this. And today, again, I had my monthly epiphany. For heaven's sake – really? Am I so present moment that I can't keep track of the rhythms of my life? Apparently.But enough complaining.On Sunday I was in church listening to an elderly gentleman read the lessons, and then another elderly gentleman talked about his experiences on ships during World War II. I was filled with a sense of gratitude and sadness. Gratitude that I got to be with these men now, but such a sadness that I won't know them longer. I'll bet they were pistols when they were younger. But how can you tell which younger people will be as interesting when they're older? If I knew I'd work on getting to know them now!I took a picture of the infamous pig today – he's a (rather silly) dragon right now. But you'll have to wait until Saturday to see him – he's definitely my picture of the day. Until then, enjoy these random pictures I took from my desk at work & a few that Dr. M took today – helping to remind me of some of the other cycles of life…Nekkid Sheep. Heh."},

We were going to go back to the fen to see what's new, but it's raining. Maybe we'll get out there tomorrow afternoon. We got this laundry cart because the washer & dryer are in the kitchen. We used to roll the whole thing into the kitchen, but these days we just tote the clothes back & forth. I like that the bins are small so we do laundry in smaller more manageable loads (we had to get a compact dryer to fit into the space – can't cram too many clothes into it).It's my oldest nephew's birthday today. I can't believe that this little angel is 18 today! What the heck? He's graduating high school this year & plans to enter the computer world. He's been taking computer classes at the local community college. He'll go there for a bit & then probably transfer to a four year college. I think if he could he'd just crawl right inside the computer. But we'd miss you B1! As is my modus operandi I have forgotten to send him a card & his annual birthday check.

{"title": "Honest Scrap", "date": "Friday, April 30, 2010", "text": "Ann T. Hathaway has given me the Honest Scrap award. I’m quite honored because she is one of my hero bloggers. You never know what you’ll find when you go to her blog. World War II logistics, Miss Ellen the bicycle, Zombies in the basement, PTSD, training for the blue line, and books, books, books. All discussed with her special brand of compassion & humor. Consider this little gem from yesterday: “I need a Wrench. Miss Ellen's handlebars are suddenly headed West when I want to go North. It is possible to steer like this, but only to Eventual Disaster.” So I’m pretty psyched to be one of her “chosen” even if I’m probably the fluffiest entry. She has actual Serious people and Heroes on her list. The rules are that I’m to tell 10 things about myself and then give the award to 10 people. I can’t even imagine what is left to tell you guys that you don’t already know, but I am always up for talking about myself!1. Here is an old pet peeve that recently reared its ugly head. I hate it when people use “ya’ll” when talking to just one person. It’s a contraction of “You All” & when you use it directed to one person it makes me think of Gidget – no – Norma Rae – no – Sybil! That’s it! Unless the person really does have multiple personalities don’t call them “ya’ll.” Of course, this could just be the case in my area of the south – maybe other southerners use it differently. But they’re wrong. Heh.2. When I was a small child I had heard of illegitimate children, but all I knew was that they didn’t have fathers. I didn’t like boys at the time, so all of my Barbies had illegitimate children.3. I always wished for one special talent – like dancing or singing or doing the grapevine in Jazzercise without falling over. But, knowing my limitations (lack of rhythm and pitch and general klutziness) and knowing my limited attention span, I am, in lower middle age, ready to accept one thing that I can claim as my own: the ability to randomly turn a nice phrase. A nice phrase does not a poem make – but it does make reading the poem a little more palatable. 4. I have to have a reminder on my calendar to water the plants at work. And I’m not sticking my finger in that dirt to check them! They get watered every other week whether they need it or not.5. Speaking of said aversion to dirt under my fingernails, for Father’s Day I once gave my dad a “coupon” for digging potatoes in the garden. I considered it the ultimate sacrifice.6. I drive by an airfield on my way to work every day. They give rides. I would love to take a ride in one of those little planes! Today I thought how much my mother would have loved to take such a ride too. Random grief – it’s kind of hard to plan for.7. I hate ending a sentence with “for.” But I’m just not going to become a contortionist to fix it. I mean, really: “Random grief – for which it’s kind of hard to plan” just doesn’t make sense.8. I have a bad habit of using humor to deflect pain. Which is ok in its place – but not everyone is like me. They know that facing and moving through pain helps in the healing process. I find it ironic that the person who taught me to take up my humor shield is my mother. And I’m using the life skill she taught me to deal with her loss.9. I am amazed that I’m digging into this grief today! It’s a random Friday in April. No special significance. It’s that darn airfield’s fault.10. Let’s end this with a thanksgiving: I am so grateful to be married to my Renaissance man Dr. M. He can teach Old Testament and American History. He can attack computer viruses. He can grow almost anything and fix almost anything. He is hilarious and loves baseball like I do. And he gets me, which I’ve found is very rare. Love you Dear Heart!OK, now I’m supposed to give this award out to ten people. And just like those emails where you’re supposed to tell folks what color of socks you’re wearing (I’m commando today!) I don’t expect everyone to actually do anything with this award. Some people don’t “do” awards and some people don’t have time and some people wonder who the heck is this chick giving them an award! Mostly I just want to talk about what their blogs mean to me.1. Amy at All Things Ro. Amy is a great mom, recent fiancée, music teacher extraordinaire, and absolutely hilarious. Stop by her blog & check her out!2. Katy from What A Great Place To Be A Cow. She writes thought-provoking essays about whatever is in her head. Her head is very interesting (although it seems to be a bit obsessed with Disney) – you should go see for yourself!3. Reya at According to the Cosmology of Reya. She does NOT want this award. Well tough patooties. She may ignore it, but you should not ignore her fabulous musings about the universe & her place therein. 4. Kim at hmmm – which blog shall I use? She has three. I think I’ll use this one, Prayers for the Oft Traveled Road, She make me think hard about what God desires for my life and what I can do to facilitate the process.5. Anne at Reverent Irreverence. Anne is an Episcopal Priest and Pampered Chef consultant who gives us a glimpse into her life every day. When Anne has a bad day she always shares what she’s doing to make it better – and that helps me to tackle my bad days too.6. Ellen, from Stuff from Ellen’s Head. She also does not want this award. Well, Ellen, what did I say to Reya? Just accept that you’re fabulous – you don’t have to do anything if you don’t want to. Ellen has a view of life that just makes me stop the frenzy & relax. I don’t know why, but she calms me down all the time. And that’s not even what she’s trying to do – she’s just letting us know what’s going on in her life in a wry, laidback way.7. Barry, from An Explorer’s View of Life. Barry is a fabulous story-teller with a lot going on in his life right now. He doesn’t need to be messing with an award like this. But you need to go visit him and learn that life really is fascinating if you tell the story the right way.8. Jo, from A Majority of Two. Jo likes to talk about her “little blog” and I guess sometimes it might seem inconsequential to an outsider when she talks about her new chairs or mattress. But Jo likes to tackle tough controversial subjects. I don’t always agree with her, but I always find her interesting. And Jo doesn’t want this award either. Heh.9. Jayne from Journey Through Grace. Jayne often posts excellent pictures of the birds around her home. But it’s her posts about her life that bring me back again and again. Grace is the right word to use to describe how she approaches the everyday world.10. Argent from Delusions of Adequacy. While her blog title is fabulous (it could be talking about me!) it’s her writing that I enjoy week after week. She’s a songwriter (and singer!), poet, and short story writer with a lot of talent. Although I think Harold’s tale has moved beyond the realm of the short story!OK, there you go. Check out all these great people & tell them the Bug sent you!Whew! That was exhausting."},

{"title": "You Know How I Love Vacuums", "date": "Thursday, April 22, 2010", "text": "In 1997 when Dr. M & I were moving from North Carolina to Cincinnati, in a fit of insanity, J hired me over the phone. I was the office administrator for a company that provided services to adults with mental retardation – we had group homes and also provided direct care staff for people who lived in their own home. I worked there for nearly 5 years. J had been promoted from the business manager to the director of the agency & did that for a few years before she was burned out with the industry. She got a human resources job at another local company (actually using her degree) and when a position in her department came open she dragged me to the new company (I went with fear & trembling, but yes, I was lured by the Almighty Dollar –it was a BIG increase for me). Even though I am NOT a people person, she made me work in HR for 6 years. I liked the part of my job where I entered data & ran reports. Dealing with employees in crisis? Not so much. Part of my job was managing medical leaves, so I was exposed to a lot of crises. After 6 years the company was in the midst of restructuring. They were outsourcing a lot of my tasks and I could read the writing on the wall. Rather than wait for my severance package I decided to apply for another job in the same company. I got that job – legal assistant – and have enjoyed it quite a bit. I work with one attorney behind a locked door. It's peaceful in there. J's office is just around the corner & I see her every day. In the nearly 13 years that I've known J, I've seen her through a divorce, internet dating, a second marriage, infertility, and twins. But our biggest challenge is just beginning.For various reasons, she's losing her remaining two employees (who are also my friends – why do they have to abandon us?) and will be left with just a temp.

{"title": "Wednesday Random Dozen", "date": "Wednesday, April 21, 2010", "text": "The Random Dozen is hosted by Linda at 2nd Cup of Coffee. Go there to check out the answers other folks gave to these questions. You might learn something interesting! As opposed to here where you're mostly going, \"Huh?\"This week Linda informed us that George Washington has a couple of overdue books at one of NYC's oldest libraries. They were only due November 2, 1789. Libraries are so strict! OK, here are this week's questions, and my questionable answers:1. Ever had any run-ins with the \"library police?\" I am one of those obsessive people when it comes to library fines. In general, the only time I owe them is when they won't let me renew the book & I'm not done yet. Dr. M says – just finish the book & pay the fifteen cents already! But it makes my heart hurt to think I'm depriving someone else of the joy of the book (I don't really care about the fifteen cents).2. Do you have a special organizational plan and place for wrapping paper, gift bags, etc., or do you just purchase whatever you need as you give gifts? I do have a place for gift wrap, etc. – a bin we keep under the bed. And, I'm ashamed to say, that sometimes just to keep from having to crawl under the bed to get it I will buy something at the store instead.3. Have you ever been in (first-hand witness) a natural disaster? Does the Blizzard of '93 count? It was while we were living in the Asheville NC area. I remember my boss called me from the office wondering where I was. He had cross country skied in. He was obviously joking. Wasn't he? What I remember most from that event was that we never lost power – although we did lose cable. Bummer. (P.S. I'm making light because it was not really a big deal for us, but for many other people it really was a disaster). 4. What's your favorite Barry Manilow song? My dad calls him Barry Monotone. And I must admit that listening to an entire album can be mind-numbing. But I can't help it – I love most of his music! So it's really hard to pick, but I'm going to go with the obvious (at least to me) & pick Copacabana. Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl… you probably don't really want to hear me sing this. Heh. 5. What's the best costume you've ever worn?  My wedding dress! Well, it felt like a costume – all girly & fancy. Hmmm. If I don't pick that, then I'll go with my flapper costume. 6. Which do you use more often, the dictionary or the thesaurus? The thesaurus. The advent of spell check means that I very rarely use a dictionary but I'm always looking for a new way to say something. 7. What's your favorite breakfast food? It used to be French Toast – yum! But now when I wake up I want something more savory, so I crave grits, eggs & livermush. Yum!8. Have you ever purchased anything from an infomercial? The Tony Little Gazelle! I've had the thing for years. Sadly, I use it only sporadically. Which may be why it's lasted so long.9. Have you ever crawled through a window? I can't believe it, but I don't remember ever crawling through a window. Although I have a vague recollection of squishing myself through a car window, it's possible that I'm just imagining that scenario. Because who doesn't want that image in their mind?10. Do you believe in love at first sight? I have never experienced it with a person, but that doesn't mean it couldn't happen. Dr. M and I gravitated toward each other gradually. Now, if we're talking food or handbags, then I've had love at first sight MANY times.11. How many pairs of jeans do you own? Do we count the ones we can't wear right now? Let's not. The ones that can make their way over my current booty are five in number – but I mainly only wear three of them. The reason I have so many (I'm usually a wear them until they shred kind of person) is that we often get the opportunity to pay money to wear jeans at work and my coworkers notice if I wear the same pair every day. Why do they have to be so observant? I'm wearing jeans right now because I donated to the March of Dimes for the privilege for the month of April. 12. If someone were going to bake a cake to honor/represent you, what would it be? (Think creatively, like Duff and Crew on \"Ace of Cakes.\") Opus from Bloom County. Isn't he the cutest thing? Now that I think about it, why hasn't anyone done this for me before? I love bakery cake. Would it have been so hard to have the Kroger make one in the shape of a penguin? Hmmm?"},

So I'm just going to spout my own brand of crazy random.My boss is back from vacation and I'm busy! I like it!I've been listening to the audio book, The Year of Living Biblically, One Man's Humble Quest to Follow the Bible as Literally as Possible, by A.J. Jacobs. I'm on disk 5 of 12. The author is an agnostic, secular Jewish man whose previous memoir was about his attempt to read the Encyclopedia Brittanica in one year. He is both earnest and hilarious as he attempts to wend his way through the morass that is Biblical law. He treats the religious people he meets with curiosity and respect - spending three hours with a Jehovah's Witness representative, visiting the Creation Museum in Northern Kentucky, and visiting an Amish Bed & Breakfast. Personally, I think that religious & non-religious people who like his brand of humor would enjoy this book a great deal. Although I still have 7 disks to go - maybe he'll lose me before the end. Thanks to my cousin KJ for getting me started (she called me while she was reading the chapter on stoning & was cracking up telling me I had to read this book).I'm wearing my Toms shoes again today - it feels like I'm wearing slippers!The weather has been really nice here this week - cool & sunny. I brought the camera to work with me. I plan to take pictures of flowers - and maybe some geese - during lunch today.Dr. M is giving a lecture on Abraham Lincoln for the history club tonight. Which makes me think about Confederate History Month and this quote from The Daily Kos:  \"Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour claims that there's no need, really, to mention slavery during 'Confederate History Month,' saying that 'It’s trying to make a big deal out of something that doesn’t matter for diddly.'\" Really? And don't even get me started on why we need to celebrate confederate history. I might be from the south, but I always thought I was a Yankee.I went by the local courthouse today to pick up the application and study guide to become a Notary Public. This is for my job. I will not be putting out a shingle & notarizing car titles. (Car titles scare me). I was amused that the study guide is called \"A Manual for Notaries Public.\" They're just showing off that they know how to pluralize Notary Public.There is a concrete pig at a house that I drive by on my way to work. The pig is always dressed seasonally appropriately. He's been Santa Claus, Cupid, a Leprechaun, and today he has an ice pack on his head & is holding a sign saying \"Tax Time.\" I wanted to get a picture, but I would have to actually park in the driveway to do it. Yes, I am a coward. Sigh.OK, that's enough randomness for today. I need to get back to work. Maybe I'll post some pictures tomorrow. Or maybe I'll just finish the other book I'm reading - a serial killer in New Orleans - yikes!"},

{"title": "TOMS Shoes", "date": "Thursday, April 1, 2010", "text": "Ever since I developed arthritis in my left hip my feet have been fairly boring. Not that I was a four-inch heel kind of gal (remember? Klutz, Party of 1), but I used to wear little, cute, kind of useless shoes. I had a gazillion pairs of shoes in my closet. Now I require support and comfort. Boring.So when a friend posted on Facebook that there was this company that gave a pair of shoes to a child in need with every purchase of their shoes, I perked up a little, but not a lot. I needed to check out the shoes first to see if they would meet my comfort needs. When I went to the website I saw that most of the shoes were flats, and looked a lot like espadrilles. I decided that even if I couldn't wear them all day, they were cute enough to order a pair.They came yesterday and I wore them all day today. I. love. them! They're cute & comfortable, and I get a warm & fuzzy feeling knowing that I helped a child with my purchase. So, this is my little advertisement for them. No, I'm not getting paid (although if someone wants to send me a free pair of shoes, I wear U.S. women's size 6.5). Here's a blurb from their website:TOMS Shoes was founded on a simple premise: With every pair you purchase, TOMS will give a pair of new shoes to a child in need. One for One. Using the purchasing power of individuals to benefit the greater good is what we're all about. The TOMS One for One business model transforms our customers into benefactors, which allows us to grow a truly sustainable business rather than depending on fundraising for support.Why shoes?Many children in developing countries grow up barefoot. Whether at play, doing chores or going to school, these children are at risk:•A leading cause of disease in developing countries is soil-transmitted diseases, which can penetrate the skin through bare feet. Wearing shoes can help prevent these diseases, and the long-term physical and cognitive harm they cause.•Wearing shoes also prevents feet from getting cuts and sores. Not only are these injuries painful, they also are dangerous when wounds become infected.•Many times children can't attend school barefoot because shoes are a required part of their uniform. If they don't have shoes, they don't go to school. If they don't receive an education, they don't have the opportunity to realize their potential."},

I decided to make the change in honor of spring and my blogoversary!Yes, I created my blog one year ago today. I had been wandering around the blogosphere reading and commenting and suddenly I was hit with an irresistible urge to join the fray. I think there might have been a virus going around.At the time I thought that I would be totally anonymous so I could say what I thought. But as I may have mentioned in this post, I over-share.

This week it's being hosted by Southlakesmom at I Didn't Know THAT!. Go to her site to check out the other folks who are participating.1. What is your favorite sign of Spring?2. Did you remember to spring forward on March 14?  If not, how did it impact your day? We did remember – although we were at my dad's house & traveled back to Ohio that day, so it wouldn't have mattered that much if we'd forgotten. Monday was the tough day. Who knew that my body would know what time it was? I thought I was in charge here!3. If soil, time, talent and climate were no problem, what vegetable would you plant in a garden this year? Just one? Hmmm. Cabbage! I'm TOTALLY kidding. I hate cabbage. I think I'd grow lettuce. If I had more choices, then I'd add tomatoes, peppers, cheese (what, that doesn't grow in a garden?). I'd basically like to walk out my door & have instant salad!4. If soil, time, talent and climate were no problem, what fruit would you plant? Blueberries! For my salad.5. What is your least favorite insect? I'm going to say slugs. Are they in the insect family? I refuse to go find out! Blech!6. March 22 was World Water Day. To celebrate, here are some water questions. Do you drink bottled water? If so, what brand? I used to buy fairly cheap bottled water & then just wash & refill the bottles with water from my Brita pitcher. Now I use a metal water bottle (Flylady brand, if you're interested – if you put ice in it at night the ice is still there in the morning!).7. Have you ever been somewhere that it was not safe to drink the local water? If so, how did you handle that? No, even in Zambia the water was fine (for me anyway – I think some missionaries had problems). I do remember being at Girl Scout camp one year – we were tasting foods from around the world & I couldn't find a single thing to drink! So I just kept eating the pineapple from the Hawaii table.8. How many glasses of water do you drink per day? Sadly, since we were told that soft drinks can count as our liquid for the day I've decreased my water consumption. Even though I know that it's better for me. I probably drink about five glasses (40 oz.) a day on a regular basis.9. March 24 is the birthday of Harry Houdini.  Have you ever watched a professional magic show? Share. No. I don't think my nephew B1 counts, although he did like to show us his card tricks.10. Have you ever been a participant in a professional magic show (up on stage!)? Nope – and I don't think it's happening at this late date! 11. March 24 is also the birthday of Steve McQueen and Clyde Barrow. Do you like Westerns or gangster movies?  If so, what is your favorite? It probably depends on the director – I like some of each. I generally like westerns better than gangster movies, but I think it's the scenery more than anything. I did really like The Untouchables (the baby carriage scene is pretty amazing).12. (Really random)  What U.S. state that you've never visited would you like to visit someday? This is TOUGH. There are so many I've never visited. I haven't been to New England, or the west coast. In fact the farthest west I've been is Kentucky (with a teensy little foray into Missouri when we drove across a bridge & then back again). But I think at the top of my list would be northern California to visit the redwood forest. In summary, I need to keep looking out for flowers, drink more water, stock up on salad items, and plan a trip to California!"},

If you met me in person you would quickly realize that not only do I not have a filter for things I say, but that I think that all the things I'm thinking about are fascinating. I over share. Just a tad.Once, when I was doing the sermon on Youth Sunday (boy those folks LOVED me - I was the soul of brevity, so no problem at all with getting out of church in time to beat the lunch crowd), I may have mentioned that our family sometimes skipped church because we were tired. And that on those days my parents had us read a story out of the Children's Bible. Afterward, my dad said that people liked a woman of mystery. That I did not need to share everything that was in my head. Really. And now I feel like I've shared that story on here already.

She was gone the following March.We had a pretty typical mother/daughter relationship. Love, hate, & all those other lovely messy emotions in between. She was my best friend and, quite simply, the center of our family's universe. Even after Dr. M & I married we merely orbited around the sun that was her. Her death sent all of us reeling, trying to find something to grab hold of. I think we've settled back down again, five years later. But there's a loss there.

When we came back last Sunday it was all gone and the grass was green! We've still had cold mornings, but the weather has been so nice that I almost believe that it's really spring. Once again I find myself apologizing for the pictures. I was playing around with my Corel Photo Album program & went just a tad completely crazy. Fun with frames! I would like to promise to control myself in future, but it's just not truthful to make such a promise. Sunday, March 14thWe drove back from NC on Sunday. This is a picture of the flooding in the Kanawa River Valley in West Virginia. I think these folks are used to it, but it was pretty scary to me!  Monday, March 15thMonday I decided at the last minute to participate in Willow's Magpie Tales meme because the photo prompt reminded me of a poem I wrote in college. So that necessitated a dive into my old poetry journal. I really should transcribe all of these before the journal falls apart!Tuesday, March 16thDr. M got the mower out today to make sure it will crank.

No. It was late in the day & the only thing I could think about was eating pierogies for dinner. So that's what I took a picture of. Eating potatoes is Irish – right?Thursday, March 18thI wore my \"tall girl shoes\" on Thursday. My mom bought me these shoes years ago & I think they're the cutest things, but a) I don't really do very well in shoes with heels (Klutz, Party of 1 – that's me) and b) oh the pain in the balls of my feet after wearing them all day! So Thursday night I bagged them up to give them to my friend A. And I took pictures to commemorate them.   Friday, March 19thSigns of spring – the Good Humor ice cream truck, and The Bug finally pulling the penguin luminaries up.

I was in the middle lane. As I approached the little band of workers, one of them dipped his shovel into a bucket, and during a lull in traffic, took the contents of the shovel blade & flung it at a pothole in the right lane. You may find this hard to believe, the (What? Gravel?) did not actually make it to the pothole. The (What? Sediment?) scattered across the pavement like marbles hit by an aggie (another marble - not a Texas athlete). In future you might want to consider a more efficient way of filling potholes. Perhaps employing a few of the orange barrels in your possession. Just an idea.Sincerely,The BugDear Virginia DOT,I, the undersigned, did witness the above described action on March 14, this annum, and do attest to the veracity of the above statement. I further make additional comment for the VA-DOT's consideration. While one commends the VA-DOT for its efforts to fill the myriad potholes left by the ravages of an unusually harsh winter, flinging by shovel some Asphalt concoction in the above mentioned pothole's general direction during lulls in traffic MIGHT not be the most effective means by which to repair said pothole. Sincerely,Dr. MThis picture has nothing to do with the above-matter - but we took it while travelling through Virginia on the very day that the incident occurred."},

It took quite some doing to choose a handful of representative pictures from the trip. There are more than usual on a couple of days, but you know what – you guys are just going to have to suffer through it! It was too hard to decide! Later I'll do some follow-up posts to highlight specific aspects of the trip. I apologize – I'm not going to edit the pictures this week, so they'll be fairly large. Sunday, March 7thWe stayed at my dad's house until we headed for Charleston, SC on Wednesday. Sunday was spent in church matters (I went to church & didn't even feel compelled to throw the hymnal at the pastor! I consider that quite a victory.). Later in the day we realized that we hadn't taken any \"Project 365 worthy\" pictures. So I made Daddy & Amy pose for us. We got them this flag last year. My dad is an NC State fan & Amy is a University of North Carolina fan. In North Carolina this is almost like the division between the Rebels & the Yankees. Serious business. So we thought the flag was appropriate. They're crying over it because their basketball teams were not very good this year. Carolina is usually a top seed, but this year won't even make the tournament. State is usually not very good, so not that surprising – except that they did well in the ACC tournament. They probably still won't play any further this year. Now I'm free to pull for teams based on their colors/mascots/whether I like the coach. Go March Madness!Monday, March 8thDr. M did what he does best on Monday – taking pictures of sheep! I like this one because the landscape is pretty representative of where we both grew up in North Carolina. I'm amused that they sheared the sheep - & then some of them apparently required blankets! That would be me – naked sheep with a blanket on. Then I'd have to throw it off in the middle of the night. Oh, wait, that's a whole other topic altogether.Tuesday, March 9thI took a ton of pictures on Tuesday in addition to the ones that Dr. M took. I posted some flower pictures last Monday. I'll save the others for another post. For now, just enjoy this crafty birdhouse.Wednesday, March 10thWhen we were leaving Daddy & Amy's house on Wednesday they were getting ready to go out with their singing group to sing some, guess what? St. Patrick's Day songs! Too bad we don't have a video of this group singing – I have a feeling they're a hoot. P.S. My father is growing a beard for his part as a person in the crowd in their Easter extravaganza. I vote for him to shave it afterward. What do you think?Here is a picture from Charleston – more flowers!!Thursday, March 11thPoor Dr. M! This was the day he read his paper at the conference (you do know that this was a working vacation, right), & it was POURING rain all day. He had to walk further than he expected so he was soaked. I stayed in the hotel the whole day. I would look out at the rain & think, \"Hmm. Shopping? Or book?\" It really wasn't a contest – the book won (a Lawrence Block). Here is a picture Dr. M took on his way to the conference. Lovely & drenched. Friday, March 12thOn Friday we took the ferry out to Fort Sumter. Don't tell Dr. M, but I didn't really realize that Sumter was on an island (a man-made one at that!). I thought it was on the end of the peninsula. So I was a bit surprised to have to take a ferry. I'm about a Grade C historian's wife. Heh. It was a misty day – and as we were leaving the fort the fog was setting in. After Sumter we went to Fort Moultrie. I enjoyed that fort a lot - & was wishing I had more energy left to explore it. If we make it back to Charleston I'd make this a must-see. Saturday, March 13thOn Saturday, before heading back to my dad's house, we took a shuttle bus tour to see what we'd missed. The tour was awesome - we loved our tour guide! After the tour was over we went back to buy one of the sweet grass baskets we'd seen.Go here to see the blogs of all the other Project 365 participants.I had very strict rules for this vacation. I could read blogs, but not comment on any (except I commented on Gretchen's because she needed my vote). I also took a vacation (mostly) from posting on my own blog. It was nice, but now I'm ready to dive back in. Except I'm not home yet. We're heading there a little later this morning & I'll get my Project 365 post up. Until then - what do you think? Do we look like we had a good time?"},

I love the bendy water…Wednesday, March 3rdWe all know what day this was, right? My birthday! I already posted a picture of my cake, so I decided to take the monthly picture of Martha Goose. As you can see, she is wearing her April showers costume. The problem is that the March costume is a bunny outfit, which is obviously meant for Easter – so we're saving that one for April. Can you tell we give this entirely too much thought!?Thursday, March 4thThursday was a beautiful sunny day, prompting Dr. M to take another ramble. Did you know that we already have 158 pictures on the new camera? And I've deleted some of them already. I had such a hard time choosing the pictures from this day, but I was able to narrow it down to three.This last one shows the wall of snow by the side of the road – created by the snow plows & wind. This wall isn't even as high as the one we travelled through last Sunday – scary!Friday, March 5thOn Friday I attended a Tastefully Simple party. For those of you who have attended such a party you know that the whole point is that you get to sample all the food. This picture doesn't show all the food, but I thought it was pretty representative. Yes, I ordered some things. It was a benefit for the church – that's why I did it. Really!Saturday, March 6thI am writing this on Friday night because we're heading out sometime Saturday morning (not too early!). My plan is to take a picture of the trunk of the car filled with luggage. We'll see what actually ends up in this space!Two people, eight days - it's a full trunk! Boy my car is FILTHY.

I love bakery cake - yum! My birthday is today, but he teaches until nearly 8:00 on Wednesdays so we celebrated early. And this is what happened when I opened my Dad's birthday card - this is the confetti that was on the tables at Thanksgiving & it ended up all over the floor. I used to send out cards with confetti in them all the time - payback is heck. Heh. Thanks Daddy & Amy!Now it's on to the Random Dozen, hosted by Lidna at 2nd Cup of Coffee. Go to her site to check out the other participants - it's always a hoot!1. Do you prefer even or odd numbers? Any particular reason? I'm not really a numbers person. Even though I have an Accounting degree. And I spend a lot of time counting (50 seconds to rinse my hair in the shower – 1001, 1002, 1003…). And I'm trying to decide how I feel about turning 46 TODAY. 2. On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being \"not at all\" and 10 being Carly Simon-worthy, how vain are you? Well, this is my comment on Linda's Monday blog post: I'm probably the most vain person in my life - in a self-deprecating I'm so not worthy way. It's a lethal combination (lethal as in, guaranteed to put you to sleep).3. Among these Irish stereotypes, with which do you identify most closely? Talkative, Proud, Inquisitive, Love to party, Hot-tempered. Hmm – I'm going with inquisitive. My friends know that I have a fetish about looking in boxes. If you have a decorative box in your home, I'm going to open it to see what's in there. So make sure it's not your stash! My nosy side is really annoyed that I don't work in Human Resources any more.4. How lucky do you consider yourself? On a scale of 1 – 10 I'd say about an 8. I've had a lot of good things happen to me – especially meeting Dr. M (thanks KJ!). 5. What is the subject of your favorite post that you've written? Well, the one about the Rapture ranks right up there LOL. And then there's the Snuggie one. And my dad's green bean scrambled eggs. But I think my favorite posts are the poetry ones, and since they're all my children I can't pick just one – sorry!6. Describe March weather where you live in three words. Cold, windy, waiting7. How apt are you at detecting blarney when you hear it? (Smooth talk, flattery) Sadly, I always think that if the person is flattering me then it's blarney. This could be a self-esteem issue. 8. How \"green\" are you, environmentally speaking? I'm about 40% green I think. We recycle. I think about the water & heat we use, but don't consciously reduce either. I use cloth grocery bags & sandwich bags. I have a water bottle. I occasionally use environmentally friendly products.9. What is your favorite song this week? Well, I could say \"You're So Vain\" (thanks very much Linda!), but not really. I don't listen to music that much – I usually have words in my head instead of music. I guess I'm going to go with the NBC Olympic theme song – it's still rattling around in there!10. You are walking along and see a coin on the ground. What denomination does it have to be before you will stop to pick it up? Well, now, the denomination doesn't matter as much as where it is & the condition it's in. Quarter in an oil puddle? No way. Penny in the grass? Probably. (note – after writing this, I was in a store & saw a penny on the floor. The penny was shiny, the floor looked clean. I did not pick it up. Apparently I do have my limits.)11. Complete the sentence: \"Every time I look outside my window ....\" I think surely it will be spring soon. Surely! 12.

I like people to know where I stand on things important to me, like how to hang the toilet paper roll (over!!) and whether everyone should have affordable healthcare (duh!!).But I don't really like controversy. I pretty much cringe from it & bury myself in a tube of chocolate chip cookie dough. Sigh.I don't usually do things like this on my blog, but, controversy or not, I couldn't let a recent article I read go without some sort of commentary. The article mentioned a service that will take care of your pets after the Rapture*. My first reaction was \"wha?\" But after spending 30 seconds with my Yahoo search engine I realized that this is something that people are seriously very concerned about. I found this site (After the Rapture Pet Care) where you can register your pet to be cared for by atheists or people of other non-Christian religions after the Rapture occurs. If you are that worried about your pet’s care, wouldn’t you want the pet to be cared for by someone with your belief system? I guess that’s not an option if you’ve all been Raptured… This one is a free service, but there are ones where you can pay (up front, of course).This site (Post Rapture Pets) mentions helpful tips about planning for your pets after the Rapture. For example: You should have multiple back up pet sitters available in case your primary sitter is taken up in the Rapture. Or, regarding a pet food dispenser: The Rapture and Tribulation times will be very chaotic, so something with a battery backup may be a good idea. And, finally: You'll need some way to let people know you are no longer around. Presumably, everyone will know that the Rapture has occurred, but just in case, here is a site that should help, http://www.raptureletters.com/. I really have no words that don’t sound like I’m mocking the concept of needing to provide for your pets in the eventuality of the Rapture. I’m trying to be non-controversial while I’m just squirming inside – you know, like when you’re in church & something strikes you as funny & you’re trying so hard not to laugh. That’s where I am right now.If you believe in the rapture and you’re concerned about your pets, then these sites may be of use to you. I’m just going to go stick my head under some cold running water so I can calm down. And maybe I’ll eat some cookie dough.*From Wikipedia: The Rapture is the gathering together of all Christians on earth at the time of the return of Jesus Christ. Belief in the rapture as a prophesied future event is found primarily among Conservative Protestant groups. The primary passage used to support this idea is 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, in which Paul cites \"the word of the Lord\" about the return of Jesus to gather his saints....and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air."},

Dr. M took it this morning before I got my lazy self out of bed. It makes me laugh every time I look at it. The luminaries had just gotten themselves unburied from the snow (see last week's 365 post to see how deep they were).

However, when leaving from work to go anywhere it's anybody's guess as to what time I'll arrive at my destination (sorry Dr. Bartnik!).Are you more of a New York or California type? I'm more of a Blue Ridge Mountain type – so I'm going with California. I think that I could find something in that big state that would feel like home.Do you have a special ring tone? One I can hear! I used to have a Norah Jones ring tone, but I could never hear it ring. So I went with a generic one that's a lot louder. What is your favorite type of chip? I'm not a humongous chip eater (although I'll eat chips if they're put in front of me). If I'm choosing at Subway, then I'm going with Harvest Cheddar Sun Chips.Best comedy you've ever seen is .... Oh this is too hard! I think I'm going to have to go with Blazing Saddles. Although Stripes was pretty funny. And Foul Play has that one scene with the tourists in the taxi that practically makes me pee my pants every time I see it. Have you ever cut your own hair? To quote Dr. Phil, \"How'd that work for ya?\" Why I cut my bangs just last week. And I'm thinking of having another go at them this weekend. But I'm not sure that bang trimming really counts (even that time when I was 4 & cut an intriguing V pattern into bangs). I haven't ever tried to cut the rest of my hair. I should – it's a mess!If you were going to have an extreme makeover, would you rather it be about your house or your personal self? If we owned our house then I would want it to be about that – we already have some great ideas about what we'd do to this house if it was ours & we had the money. Given that we rent, then I'm going with me!Are you allergic to anything? Only the known universe. I exaggerate. But since I'm sneezing every five minutes while I'm typing this… I'm allergic to mold (including old books – and I think that includes the hymnal from church), long haired cats, and some trees. I also think that I'm \"sensitive\" to whatever they use to treat the roads for snow & ice – I believe that's the cause of my sneezing fit this morning.Why is it so hard to change? OK, I'm going to read all the answers to this question in the hopes that someone has a good solution to this problem! I'm currently working through the Geneen Roth workbook, Why Weight? A Guide to Ending Compulsive Eating, and although one part of me wants to succeed, another part of me just doesn't care enough to work at it. Sigh.One last question dedicated to February love: CS Lewis said, \"To love is to be vulnerable.\" Please share one example of that assertion or share any thought you'd like to about this topic. If you do it right, this is so true! You have to trust that the person with whom you share your secrets will hold them close and not betray you. And that they won't hold that secret knowledge over your head. Here's a poem I wrote to Dr. M for our 8th anniversary in 1998. Heh – in this poem I sound like I think I'm grown up – that was 11 years ago!When we really met that January,how could we know that by Christmaswe would be bound together by loveand secrets shared?And by the Christmas after thatwe were married.Married!I look at those two peopleand think how far they have to goto be who we are now.They were sweet,connected at the hip,lovers and confidantes.Children.I think of you now in your study.My love, my lifeworking toward your dream...It's my dream too.And yet, I don't even care if we get there--my journey with you is my life.I view what happens along the waythrough the filter of us.It's a pretty good filterdon't you think?"},

Now in my middle years the melody has drifted away somewhere – out of reach of my grasping fingers. I'm trying to sing alto, fumbling for that counter note - the one that's not there in my head. My first choir practice I try to hear that note under the insistence that is melody. I'm listening, catching it some of the time. And then, I was a teenager sitting on that second row in the choir at Brookford Baptist Church. In my ear I could hear Mrs. Holsclaw (who always wanted us to make a big deal of the \"s\" sound at the ends of words). And there was my grandmother – as natural an alto as you ever heard. She gave that gift to my aunt Emily, who shares it with my Dad at the nursing home on Sundays. I heard them all right there and for a while the noise I made was actually music. I found that note and the sound was so sweet that it almost made me cry. Mamaw & Emily"},

There will be one more post after this one – although I might randomly post some other things as I think about them. When I first arrived in Lusaka I stayed at the Baptist Complex, which had 8 flats for missionaries as well as the guest house for visitors. I lived there for a while, and then moved out to the Baptist Seminary. I lived in the last little house on the road by myself for a while, and then with a roommate who worked with the communications ministry. Once again I'm dismayed at the pictures I don't have, but here are a few of the ones I do have. My little house and my truck I inherited Amber the Wonderdog from the previous journeymen. Under my care she got mange! I had to wrestle her to the vet a few times, but she ultimately recovered just fine. I ended up giving her away before I left to a family who really wanted a dog. My room. Note the contact lens boiler on the bed (my second one since I fried my first one).The stuffed dog was a gift from my brother my freshman year in college. I took him to have a bit of home with me – and I still have him now! Samuel the Spaniel is a well-traveled stuffed animal! My roommate Stacy is cooking something (thank heavens she arrived – she could COOK!) and the other Dana (a teacher at the American Embassy School) is laughing with her. Quite possibly at me. That would not have been unusual. Look – I made a lemon meringue pie!!! With actual lemons from my actual lemon tree! I was so pleased with myself… This is the road to the seminary. Unfortunately the camera flattened out the ruts so you can't really appreciate just how bad this road was! The state of the road didn't stop me from flying down it & raising a cloud of dust. I have no sense. But, you know, you figure out the best route around the worst of the ruts & it's kind of like a game to see how fast…. Um, I'm just making it worse aren't I? Next week I'll have a handful of pictures of the people who worked where I did. And I'll say goodbye to Zambia for another while."},

{"title": "Just Do It!", "date": "Friday, February 19, 2010", "text": "I must say that the second day of Lent (or is this the first day & Ash Wednesday is its own day?) has just let me have it with both barrels. I have often practically bragged about how sluglike I am – slothful, lazy, slacker, \"Piece of Sh** Housewife\" (sorry for the language - this was the result of a Facebook quiz – and is terrifyingly accurate!)… These are all adjectives I've used for my usual demeanor. Well, now I'm forced to admit that this behavior is probably not the best me that I can be – or the me that God would like me to be. Here is the reading for the 18th from this website (emphasis added):We call it procrastination. Sometimes it is fleeting and temporary. At other times it becomes so habitual that we lack the energy or motivation to do what needs to be done. Sly as a snake, sloth has slipped into our soul and shut down our desire to be active in bringing God's goodness to the world by what we create. Sloth feels like pampering at first, but gradually our soul grows heavy, and it feels like our meaning has been stripped away.I'm on the mailing list for Barbara Cawthorne Crafton's almost daily motivational emails (eMo's). She's a bit of a hero of mine. Here is an excerpt from the eMo I received on Thursday:Jesus resisted his temptations to satiety and power better than I resist mine to indolence -- no surprise there. As always, I am impressed by how gentle and reasonable my temptations seem: Oh, never mind, sweetie, they say, you're tired. Just take it easy. God loves you just the way you are.Indeed, God does love me just the way I am. Always has, even at those sorry times when what I was has been significantly south of what I could have been. But the fact that God loves me as I am doesn't mean God wants me to stay that way forever. Part of love is challenge: Be what you can be. Grow into the full stature of Christ. Use what I have given you, and take joy in using it. I will give you the energy for it if you will step up to the plate and begin. See? Feel the stream of living water that flows straight from my heart to yours? Let that stream rush with power into the world, and you will know why I put you here, in this place, at this time.I think I'll be spending some serious time this weekend considering how to get up out of this chair and do something!"},

I've laughed & cried, shaken my fist at the air & jumped up & down with joy.At Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto it's a tradition that patients ring a bell in their lobby after their last chemo treatment. Everyone who hears the bell stops and applauds. Today, when his treatment is finished at 2:00 pm eastern standard time, Barry is ringing that bell. And hundreds of his friends all over the world are ringing bells too in celebration with him. Mine will be the bell on the front desk of the office next door (They won't be surprised.

{"title": "Going Inside My Head", "date": "Wednesday, February 17, 2010", "text": "Fat Tuesday is over and done, and I have the pancake thighs to show for it. Last year I wrote my very first post about Lent, and what the discipline of observing Lent might look like in my perfect world. I'm not feeling any more perfect this year, but I've decided to once again try to give up something and take up something. I thought long and hard about what to give up, that would be meaningful to me, and this is what I've decided. I'm going to give up the games and puzzles that I do online. No more Farmville or Farkle, no more Cryptograms or Cipher Lists. No more Webkins. I spend a lot of time with these games. I would like to see what it will be like to use that time for something a little more constructive. And so I am going to take up the practice of reading something other than someone's blog post! I'm going to read books that I have on my shelf. I'm going to read books about the emotions behind eating. I'm going to read Lenten devotions (courtesy of Jan at Yearning for God). Will I be wiser at the end of forty days? I hope so. Will I start playing my games again? I hope not with the same frenzy. Playing games is a way for me to avoid introspection. And heaven knows I don't enjoy time spent inside my head. But maybe for the sake of personal growth I can spend some time with the boring chick who lives in there. And then we can go play a rousing game of Farkle afterward. See ya later alligator!"},

And we're getting more even as I type this. Sigh.I had visited this little church a couple of weeks ago (I skipped last week because I didn't want to seem to eager. Heh.). They're a small, diverse, Episcopal congregation who can't afford a rector. So the people just run the services themselves & have a priest in a couple of times a month to do communion. There is a small choir (around 12 women), and at my first visit I was asked to consider joining it. Not because of my most excellent voice (cough cough) - I don't think the director could have heard me singing from where I was sitting. Yesterday I decided to just go ahead & join. I'm an alto who doesn't really know how to sing harmony very well (I don't have the range of my youth when I used to sing the melody line). I should fit in quite well!Yesterday after church Dr. M & I went on one of our rambles. I needed to pick up a book from Barnes & Noble, so we made it a little excursion - Indian food! Bed Bath & Beyond! The library! The pharmacy! - will the fun never end?. You know, this is exactly the type of fun I like best. It really was a beautiful day. We drove around taking pictures of more snow and generally enjoyed our time together.As I mentioned up top there, we're getting quite a bit of snow again - it's really coming down right now. I'm sure I'll be leaving work early, and I have my doubts about getting back into work tomorrow. So, you know, I'll be taking more pictures of snow. And dreaming of spring - when I'll be complaining about my allergies instead of the snow. Well, perhaps as part of my Lenten observance I'll consider doing some work on my attitude! We shall see. And I'll most certainly be telling all of you about it. Our town is in the middle of some fairly well known bike paths.

Looks pretty comfy, doesn't he?Monday, February 8thOn Monday I met with some friends for dinner at my old church in Cincinnati. We used to work together in the GED program at church (I mostly just took minutes at their meetings – we've already established that I am not a teacher LOL). I took my camera, but forgot to take pictures of the people. Head desk. Sigh. Oh well, here is a picture of the sign outside the church.On my way home I thought it would be cool to show how dark it is on some of the stretches of road. I kind of like it, actually – especially because I know that if something were to happen there are houses all along the way. It's just dark on the road.Tuesday, February 9thWe have one of those geese that you dress up each month.

Dr. M wrote love on one arm, but deciding that wasn't enough, he wrote love on his other arm – in Koine Greek no less. With his left hand. This is a man who I accuse of secretly taking that class in school where they teach doctors to be illegible. I thought he pretty well!Saturday, February 13thNow I know this picture is probably going to gross some people out. It's my understanding that this is an acquired taste & that I'm just weird. Only found in western North Carolina, Jenkins Livermush is just the best stuff! We always bring back four or five bricks of it from our visits to NC. It's mostly liver & cornmeal & has seasonings similar to sausage. Just slice, fry, & eat! It's actually not that bad for you – low in fat & has a lot of iron as you might imagine. Three Weight Watcher points for what's on my plate here. Sometimes we eat it for dinner with rice and my daddy's canned green beans, but most usually you'll see me eating it on Saturday or Sunday mornings (or both!) with grits and a fried egg.

If you want to link up or just read the other participant blogs, just click here.1. Do you use the labels various charities send you as \"free gifts?\" I didn't used to unless I had contributed, but after a while I just started getting irate. If they're going to waste money sending me stuff without checking to see if I really want to donate, then I'm just going to use it! I even used free labels on our Christmas cards.2. What is your favorite time of day (or night) for skywatching? If I were a morning person I'd say dawn, but the only time I see a sunrise is if Dr. M films it for me. Here is my favorite sky (as painted by Dr. M).3. What is the most adventurous you've ever been with trying a new food? (Keep it G-rated please). I'm gonna go with the locusts in Zambia, although the rattlesnake in college runs a close second. They were both cooked by people who weren't experts in those delicacies, so I think that was the adventurous part. Kind of like if I were to try to make a roast – it would be adventurous of you to eat it. The locusts tasted like burnt okra (because they were burnt &amp; in my memories most of the okra my mom fried was burnt). The rattlesnake tasted like chicken. Really!4. Have you ever heard a rock sing? (Trust me, there's a reason for this one!)I've heard wind whistling through rocks and that sounded like music. Does that count?5. If you could learn a language you don't presently speak, what would it be?Spanish!6. Al Capone's tombstone read, \"My Jesus, Mercy.\" If you could write your own epitaph, what would it say? If I Died For Want of Healthcare I'm Coming Back to Haunt You!7. If you were a famous musician who was known by one name, like \"Cher,\" \"Sting,\" or \"Jewel,\" what would it be? It doesn't have to be your first name, but it can be, if you'd like.Damawallace! (See my Sunday post for clarification)8. Have you ever been inordinately \"into\" a television show?When I was younger I'm sure I was, although I don't remember. In my adult life I remember a flirtation with Friends, and an obsession with West Wing for about 2 seasons. Since then, nope. I don't want to be tied down &amp; I know that I just wouldn't watch something I taped (or Tivo'd or DVR'd). I can't be bothered.9. When you sneeze, do you go big, or do you do that weird \"heenh!\" sound that makes people think you're going to blow your brains out? Any other variation we should know about?I believe that Dr. M could find me in a crowded Walmart simply based on my sneeze. It's pretty impressive if I do say so myself.10. Do you still read an actual newspaper that you hold in your hands, or do you get your news elsewhere?We recently subscribed to the \"weekend\" package for the Dayton Daily News. We get Thursday – Sunday – which I mostly read on Sunday because I won't sit down to mess with it before then. I like it because I'll actually read stories that I skip on the internet, since they're right there in front of me.11. Are you a good speller?I'd say middling. I used to be a lot better before the advent of spell check. However, I'd say when someone asks me I'm right about 95% of the time.12. At what time each day do you start thinking about Lost lunch?Seriously? Around 9:30 or 10:00 I start the pep talk. \"You can make it until 11:30. If you eat too soon you'll get hungry this afternoon. And then you'll go to the café next door to get a pretzel with cheese.\" It's a slippery slope, eating your lunch too early!To summarize (heh – I'm copying Amy Ro): I need get out of bed to catch the sunrise at least once in my life, yell \"fore\" before I sneeze and stick to eating instead of cooking. And maybe take 15 minutes each day to read the newspaper.Happy Birthday Aunt V!(She was one of the first people to call me Bug!)"},

I felt achy and gritty eyed and I wanted to stay home to do laundry & read my new J.D. Robb book (Kindred in Death). I lay there & thought about it for a minute, but then I just went ahead & got up. Later I was trying to decide whether I felt too introverted to call my boss, or if it was mostly my sense of responsibility that got me out of bed. I think it was some of both.Erin at Fierce Beagle introduced me to the website TypeLogic, which analyzes the different types from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. When we were in seminary Dr. M & I took the MBTI. I'm an ISTP Introverted Sensing Thinking Perceiving), and Dr. M is an INFP (Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Perceiving). I think it's a pretty accurate gauge of a person's inclinations. And it has helped us innumerable times in our marriage. Because, according to the MBTI, we are enigma to one another: a puzzle; totally foreign in nearly every facet.I want to fix. the. problem. Dr. M wants to understand how we feel about the problem. I'm a present moment person (so present moment in fact that I have to make a concerted effort to dress for the weather outside, not just how I feel at the moment I'm putting the clothes on – which is usually hot from my shower). Dr. M is present in all times. There is no past, present or future with him. All times are now. I want to peruse my options, make a choice quickly & get the heck out of the store. Dr. M wants to make sure he sees every possible option, pick one, but then think about it a while longer, and then think some more after we've left the store, and maybe next week too. I think we work because we're both introverted and neither of is all that into extreme order. But if you go check out our type descriptions from the website (links below), you'll see that the author lists some famous people with our types. And I'm just not sure how Tom Cruise (me) would get along with the Virgin Mary (Dr. M). Dr. M is James Taylor, Carl Rogers & Anne of Green Gables. I'm Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood & Frank Zappa. I don't really know how we work. But we definitely do. If you'd like to read about our types (or figure out your own), you can go here for mine (ISTP) and here for Dr. M's (INFP)."},

I promise – there will be some more next week. But this week I want to talk about some of the documents I required to live in Zambia – besides the obvious passport and work permit.First of all, I had to have an Aliens Registration Card. At the time I not ever heard of a non-citizen of a country being referred to as an alien so I thought that was hilarious. I was an alien. Heh.  Before I came to Zambia I was issued an International Driving Permit.However, not too long after arriving I had to apply for a Zambian driver's license. Boy that was a process! Forms and going to multiple offices, and then at the end, an oral exam along with the other missionaries who were applying for a license. I was asked what emotions might cause a person to drive carelessly. I said rage or anger or sadness. Nope, none of those was the right answer. The right answer was joy! The examiner said that a very happy person doesn't pay attention to the road. At the time I thought that was a very funny answer, but later I learned better. My only speeding ticket was a few weeks before my wedding 19 years ago. I was barreling down the road singing to Amy Grant at the top of my lungs. I was going 82 mph. In a 55 zone (it had just changed from 65, but still!). Thankfully I didn't lose my license. Anyway, I managed to pass the driving exam & received my Zambian license!A couple of other ladies and I decided to get memberships to the Intercontinental Hotel pool. We decided to say that we were a family so that it would be cheaper. Yes, I see the irony that two missionaries and a teacher at the American Embassy School (whose name was also Dana!) were cheating. I even feel somewhat ashamed about it now. In any case, we got our membership. I always laugh when I see the name – Mr. & Mrs. Damawallace. My name was Dana Wallace. Apparently I was taking the fall in this caper.The last document is my membership card to the Bulldog Den at the local marine base (? I have no idea what it was called – these were the marines assigned to the embassy). We would go to watch movies, eat popcorn and flirt with marines. I saw The Princess Bride there for the first time – one of my favorite movies of all time (next to Joe vs. the Volcano). And I got a date to the Marine Ball with one of the marines from Michigan. We also played softball with the marines (I use the word \"play\" loosely – I am no athlete). One of the guys was from eastern NC and I loved hearing that voice from home. His accent was so thick that the other marines couldn't understand him over the radio. Made me homesick, a bit.Come back next week when I talk about my attempt to teach cross-stitch at the Women's Missionary Union conference. Not a pretty picture!"},

Along the way we took a picture of my favorite sheep. None of them were standing on hay bales, but they're still pretty cute I think. And a little muddy from all the rain last weekend.Monday, January 25thOn Monday Dr. M took a few photos around his campus. There's a railroad track along the edge of campus which feeds Dr. M's train obsession.Tuesday, January 26thI have two pictures from Tuesday. The first one was taken while I was driving to work. I'm pretty sure I wasn't driving more than 60 mph at the time. Really, the only dangerous part was trying to figure out how to turn off the flash while I was driving (shut up K – I'm a good driver!).The second picture is our dinner Tuesday night. Dr. M just throws a bunch of stuff in a pot, makes some rice, and voila! Dinner!Wednesday, January 27thWe have two pictures from Wednesday too. I broke my work badge and told them I wanted a new picture for my new badge. My coworker A & I were trying to figure out how to get a good picture & she told me to not smile. I really tried, but I started laughing - & this picture was the result. We ultimately decided that the turtleneck was doing me no favors (I looked like a scoop of ice cream on top of a cone) & I tried again the next day wearing something different.At about the same time I was trying to be photogenic, Dr. M was getting his hair cut. He decided to record his curls for posterity. Note: NOT a good idea to get your hair cut in January. Just sayin.Thursday, January 28thDr. M took a picture of the beautiful moon in the sky on Thursday.Friday, January 29thOn Friday, Dr. M took another trip through the park we visited last week. This time there was a bit more snow on the ground.Saturday, January 30thLast year we added a sheep to our collection. I christened him \"Cornflake\" because I decided that his \"wool\" looked like cornflakes in a bowl of milk. This year we got a penguin from the same artist (Sara Meadows!). I wanted to put the penguin near Cornflake & the best place seemed to be on top of our computer router.

I wanted to show how little traffic I contend with until near the end of my journey. There was going to be a metaphor and perhaps a simile. And pictures of sheep on top of hay bales (makes me laugh. every. time.). But my pictures bored me (except for the fact that they're in practically full daylight – not long ago my commute was in the dark). So I'm going off on a tangent.Dr. M is teaching Old Testament this semester. Have I mentioned how hilarious I think this is? He does have a Master of Divinity (with Languages!), but that was a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. However, he is a very good teacher, and has some great material to guide him along the way.Today he talked about covenant. That the Ten Commandments are about covenant with God and with each other. That you shouldn't have to steal because your community will take care of you. That you wouldn't cheat on your wife because you have a covenant with her that shouldn't be broken. That there is no need to covet your neighbor's wealth, because God's bounty is sufficient for all.I'm not a person who believes that there is a place on a courthouse lawn for a replica of the Ten Commandments tablets. But I do wonder why we can't be in covenant with one another.

I have the thought (how tall is Jessica Alba? I want chocolate!), and then I have the result in a flash (5'6\"!Brownie!). It's kind of sad. I've tried to work on it, but so far I'm not doing very well.Maybe a marshmallow wouldn't be too difficult a temptation for you. What food (or anything else) would be most tempting? Sadly, I find many foods to be irresistible. No bake cookies. Pizza. Bakery cake. Sigh.On a scale of 1-10 (10 being saintly) how patient are you? I'm a three. I can wait a full 3 minutes before I start tapping my toes & looking at my watch.Have you ever waited for something in life only to be disappointed upon realization of the goal/object/etc.? If we're talking material things, yes. I get the whatever-it-is (keeps washed lettuce fresh!) & realize that it just doesn't cut it. Big ticket things like marriage or a new Webkins? Not really.Are you a person who takes shortcuts? Yes I do – if I don't understand why all the steps are there. If I think it's busy work, I'm skipping!Which line is hardest to wait in? The line to the bathroom!Did you wait to discover the gender of your unborn child until its birth? N/A. Although I would NOT wait if the situation ever came up. I hear pregnant women talking about their daughter or son & it just seems more special.Are you more patient with children or the elderly? I can be pretty impatient with any age group, but I think that children can send me over the edge faster than anyone else!Did you ever sneak a peek at a present? Not as an adult – I like surprises! But I remember the Christmas I learned there wasn't a Santa Claus – I discovered my Barbie camper in my parents' closet. I was NOT traumatized (Mom as Santa Claus? Cool!), but I'm afraid that my cousin K has still not recovered from me telling her all about it.What is the longest you've ever waited for anything? From the glimmer of thinking about the concept (around 1995 or so), until the offer of a position (this past summer), Dr. M's current job was quite a while coming. Please realize that he wasn't looking for a job that whole time! We had to get the Master's & Ph.D and then look for a job.Who has more patience, you or your significant other? Oh he does in most cases. He can get pretty uptight sometimes, but I'm more impatient.Which of the following songs about waiting is your pick for the best? (OK, you may substitute another, if you like.)A) Anticipation by Carly SimonB) The Waiting by Tom PettyC) Right Here Waiting for You by Richard MarxD) Wait for Me by Rebecca St. JamesI don't like any of these choices! I read the lyrics & they creeped me out a bit. But if we ignore the rest of the song, then I'm definitely The Waiting. Because it is the hardest part!Well basically, I need to just take a chill pill! Go back to the days in Zambia where going to the bank was a leisurely task, not a speed event. I was much calmer then, once I figured out the system. Ohm!"},

We don't have a lot of room for a drain, but we don't have a dishwasher so one is definitely necessary. Mike found this ingenious little bamboo one that fits the small space on the counter between the sink and the washer. Nifty! I had wanted to show one of my massive Towers o' Dishes, but had to settle for a medium tower because I was stumped for a Sunday picture & just needed to take this one. Ha!MONDAY, JANUARY 18THMonday was the trip up to Springfield where we drove through Saylor Park.TUESDAY, JANUARY 19THWhen I arrived home on Tuesday this was the sight that greeted me. The small penguin from our Christmas display made it into the garage, where he got a prime seat on the rocking horse that Dr. M's dad made for us. Dr. M plugged him in to amuse me. It worked!WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 20THMy sister-in-law B made scarves for Christmas presents this year. I was very lucky to get this lovely green & blue number. I've been wearing it with my winter coat, but on Wednesday I decided to wear it as part of my work outfit – I thought it matched my turtleneck quite well.THURSDAY, JANUARY 21STHere's another item I've been wanting to show off. Dr. M wanted to start taking sandwiches to school last semester which reawakened my uber-guilt about using sandwich baggies. I did some research on the internet & ordered two of these sandwich wraps. As you can see, the inside of the wrap is some sort of plastic material that can be wiped off & the outside is cloth. It functions as a placemat when it's unwrapped. I love them! I even got the snack wraps too – they're more of a bag that we can put chips or other types of snacks in. I took tuna sandwiches to work this week & didn't use one baggie. FRIDAY, JANUARY 22NDFriday night Dr. M & I went out for Mexican. It was quite yummy. I was going to take a picture of my plate, but I find that most of my food pictures look extra unappetizing. Blech! Instead Dr. M took a picture of the cat from next door. He's a very fat black & white beauty. We tolerate him stalking the finch feeders because he's kind of slow & dumb. He doesn't ever seem to catch anything LOL. In this picture he looks sort of demonic, but he's really a sweetie.SATURDAY, JANUARY 23RDToday is laundry day, but I'm not taking a picture of our dirty clothes! Although, hmmm – we have a pretty cool \"laundry center.\" There's an idea for a day next week when I can't think of anything else. Today I took a picture of the Encyclopedia of Northern Kentucky for which Dr. M contributed an entry on Lynching (we got our copy of the book this week). Can you believe that they needed a book this size for just northern Kentucky? Wow. It's pretty thorough. I'm quite proud of Dr. M's contribution. His dissertation was about the treatment of freed people in Kentucky after the civil war, so this is right down his alley.

If you want to participate just go to Linda's site to link up.1. So I was thinking about how Jon Bon Jovi never seems to age much. His hair is smaller nowadays, but he still manages to look like a boy somehow. And then that made me think of the story of Dorian Gray. Question: If you physically lock in one age for yourself, which would you choose and why?The year I turned 40. I had hit my weight goal & was feeling pretty good about how I looked.2. What is the best dish that you cook or bake (your piece de resistance?)I am NOT much of a cook, so there's nothing that's a sure thing. However, I have made pumpkin spice muffins (with chocolate chips) several times in the last few years & I haven't messed them up yet.3. When you feel blue, what is one strategy you use to help yourself back to normal?Sadly, eating is my number one strategy – but as you guys know I'm working on that. Reading or working puzzles are other things I do. I want to add some form of exercise to my \"feeling blue\" toolbox.4. When was the last time you danced in public?Wow – so long ago that I don't remember. I'm not sure that the swaying I do really counts as dancing anyway. 5. Do you consider yourself a realist or dreamer?I guess a bit of both – although I can be more of a dreamer in that I have ideas of how life can be, but don't really do anything to make them happen. 6. As a parent, what is one thing that you have done well?Not having children! Honestly, I think it was one of the smartest decisions I ever made. I knew as a teenager that I didn't want to be a mom – and although people assured me I would change my mind, I never waivered. 7. Which is your favorite character on the Andy Griffith show?Ooh – a tough one. I loved how even & wise Andy was. And I really liked that Ernest character. But I'm going to have to go with Barney – he was just the most hilarious dude!8. On a scale of 1-10, how much do you know about Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.?I'm married to a historian (have I mentioned that before?). I think I know a lot. He wasn't a perfect man, but I think God used him as a prophet. I really wish that we could banish racism. But it feels like it's embedded in the mortar of our country. 9. Have you never been mellow? Have you never tried … to find a comfort from in side you? (Sorry, Jorge was singing that song just now, and it just seemed to be perfect timing as I was creating this week's questions.) REAL question: What is your #1 driving pet peeve? Ooh – there are so many! Currently it's when a car flies by to get in front of me right before the four-lane road goes to two lanes. And then slows down. To below the speed limit. Really? Did you have to blast past me at 80 mph just so you could then drive 45 mph in front of me? I would so give you the finger, but the last time I tried that I ended up making the peace sign. The person at whom it was aimed just looked baffled. Clearly, my \"good girl\" subconscious was in charge.10. Which color best represents your mood today? Care to elaborate?Sort of a misty white. That's the color outside, and that's the color I am. Not really alert to the world around me, but not really feeling very bad about it. If I were taking anything other than Osteo BiFlex & Ibuprofen I would think this feeling was drug-induced. But I think it's just a sort of Monday on a Tuesday kind of feeling.11. If your spouse were an animal, which would he/she be? Well, that's easy! A bear! He's pretty cuddly, but if you mess with any of his \"children\" (he's a bleeding heart liberal, so we're ALL his children) he can get pretty irate.12. What activity takes up the bulk of your time on an average dayUm, well, um. I don't want to say. It's embarrassing. IthinkthatmostlyIreadblogs. Perhaps I should add a new hobby to my repertoire."},

When I wrote home about the experience, this is what I said:Sometimes the majesty of Africa overwhelms me. I was awed today by God's creation: The grace and beauty of giraffe, the cumbersome dignity of elephants, the absolute elegance of zebra.Tonight while we rode into what seemed like darkest Africa I could feel the vibration of a million living things. Every tree we passed was pregnant with life; the rustling grass hid lions & tigers & bears – oh my! Once we passed a baobob tree and the sound of the landrover echoed against it – it sounded like a waterfall was trapped inside the tree.I tried to be very blasé, as if game viewing was something I did every day, but the sight of my first giraffe and a baby elephant and a zebra shining in the African sun and the baby hippo climbing out of the water with its mother – ah, how could I not be moved!I very much enjoyed being a tourist – even though we had to get up VERY early to explore. Here I am in all of my 6 am glory.I was quite fascinated with the \"sausage\" tree.Here are a couple of pictures where you may or may not be able to see animals. Apparently my camera's zoom feature left a bit to be desired LOL.The elephants were funny - & slightly terrifying. One of them was very interested in the landrover. Thank goodness it ultimately decided that we weren't really all that interesting!Looking back at my documentation of this trip is when I really wish I'd had a good digital camera (something that probably didn't exist in 1987 – or if it did was prohibitively expensive). Or, you know, a good regular camera* that I knew how to operate. Who knew? I was going to do mission work, not take pictures. Sigh.*Please note that the camera I took to Africa was a really good point & shoot camera of its type given to me by my church. I was thrilled with it - & it took great basic pictures. It just needed a better zoom feature. And an owner who actually read the manual."},

Plus his commute is often in more daylight than mine is. This first picture, from Sunday, belies my opening paragraph.

I promise we hadn't had these onions that long – this one was just ready to sprout, apparently! I kind of like it up there.Dr. M took this picture on his way home from school on Thursday. There are lots of homes in our area which still have Christmas lights and decorations. I especially love the wagon wheel.Friday I decided to have a coworker take a picture of me doing some of my physical therapy for my shoulder. I try to do these stretches every day, & when I'm at work I find that the conference room table is the perfect place!Today I wanted to get this posted & couldn't think of a picture that wouldn't require that I leave my home.

As soon as I figure out what those might be.So there's this guy at work who collects egg cartons. One day I asked him why – his daughter has chickens & sells the eggs.

Why am I the kind of person who wants to be acknowledged for her good deed? Every day this week I've had to bite my tongue as I walk by his desk, prepared to casually mention as I glance at the cartons still on his desk, \"Oh, I see you got mine!\" (Flicking self in the forehead)I tried to give blood yesterday, but was denied! Apparently there is a new strain of HIV that they can't test for? And people living in Zambia during a certain period of time might have this strain? So now I'm permanently banned from giving blood! I need to research this further. I do not enjoy giving blood - but I liked that I was able to help another person by donating. I WON something else! I'm on a roll I tell you! Gretchen from Second Blooming was giving away the Classic Sampler from Saltistry Artisan Infused Sea Salts, the most amazing, delicious, decadent salt in the world. Five flavors - Lemon Thyme, Herb Grey, Six Pepper, Genmaicha, and Smoked Chili. I thought these would be just the thing to help make healthy food even better (in moderation people!), so I entered the contest & I won! Thanks Gretchen!This has been Way Back Week on Facebook. I change my profile picture practically daily, so of course it was no trouble at all for me to participate. Here is The Bug's 9th grade school picture. I know – I'm a poster child for the 70s. And, really, I look like a boy. I wonder if I cut my own bangs? Looking at that girl would you guess that she's the grammar police? She gets to wear those braces for two more years - woo hoo!"},

And those who are aghast but secretly wear them anyway. I like the concept of a Snuggie – but I was always bumfuzzled by the backless nature of the thing. Sure it's great if you want to read a book on the couch – but what if you're at your computer 24/7 (hypothetically speaking)? That open back & an office-type chair? Draft city! So Dr. M went in search of a better thing for me - & boy is it better! It's a Cuddlewrap (go here to read all about it). We call it my wigwam, which I'm sure is at least marginally offensive, but it's almost as big as a dwelling & has what appears to me to be a Native American-type pattern. Here are some pictures of me demonstrating its magnificence. I am dismayed by my double chin. It mostly appears when I'm looking down. I forget about it because I don't see it that often. Sigh. But that's what my new healthy lifestyle is about, right? Getting rid of that thing! Also, my hair doesn't look nearly as red in these pictures – it looks more like what I expected – brown hair with copper overtones. Here I am all zippered & snapped.See? It has a back!Here I am demonstrating one of its many uses. Right after this picture was snapped I went to get clothes out of the dryer. See? Versatile! This is Dr. M's Anti-Snuggie – an old giant robe of mine LOL! He took this picture with his cell phone, which doesn't have a flash, so sorry for the poor quality.

This is the kind of Africa that all my friends were expecting. I kept telling them \"I live in a city!\" but this is what they wanted to see. Huts, dirt…People carrying things on their heads…What I saw were smiles. And lots of hard work. See the little girl pounding the grain? Hard work.They let me try. It wasn't pretty. At all.

So on Sunday basically I spent the entire afternoon catching up on the newspapers. We only get Thursday - Sunday, but I apparently am only able to read them on Sundays. I kind of like the feeling of turning the pages & getting ink all over my hands - makes me feel a bit nostalgic...Monday was the first of our snow this week. We ended up with about 6 inches total. I was just mesmerized by this little table by our back door. I took its picture as soon as I got home from work - before I even came inside. I love the light glinting off the snow crystals.Tuesday was my hair crisis - which you can read about here. Nuff said.Dr. M has had a cold all week (I feel so bad that I'm a terrible nurse). This has not stopped him from shoveling the driveway numerous times. I don't know why I can't do it when I get home just because it's dark. Anyway, on Wednesday he pulled a Kleenex out of the box & this is the result. At our house we are highly amused by such things.I took this picture on my way home from work on Thursday. It's my favorite of the batch I posted here. Although I like the sheep picture a lot too. This just makes me sigh & relax into myself when I look at it.I'll admit, this is a bit of a cheat. Dr. M took the picture because I was driving. If you click on it to enlarge it you can see the geese. We were wondering if it was a training mission - the back of the V looks a little raggedy to us!And here we are to today. I colored my hair - can you tell? It's a bit redder than I expected (happy, Greg?), but I'm sure that will fade pretty quickly.

Yesterday at work I borrowed a ponytail holder because my hair was MAKING. ME. CRAZY. Seriously – I might have had some sort of hair related meltdown if my coworker hadn’t saved me. Anyway. I pulled my hair back & went on my merry way. Then I went to the bathroom (I go, oh, about 8 times during an 8 hour workday). As I was washing my hands, singing the ABC song under my breath, I glanced at my hair in the mirror. Hmm. Do I have flour in my hair? Get in a fight with a bobbin of white thread? What is that stuff in my hair?Yes, the hair that doesn’t see the sun very often has been going seriously gray. Apparently my last color job didn’t touch this hair. I know that at 45 I should not be surprised by this. But, you know, except for the arthritis, gimpy shoulder, need for reading glasses, and cranky old lady attitude, I FEEL young. Wait – I’ve had the cranky old lady attitude my whole life, so that’s not new. I guess I should be happy now that I have the hair to match the attitude. Dr. M predicts a L'Oreal saturation bombing soon. I wonder what color I’ll choose this time?"},

I was entertained by it & decided to steal it for my blog. Although, frankly, my imaginings aren't nearly as interesting as his. But they're written & ready to post & that's the important thing. Really.One year ago: I thought I’d still be living near Cincinnati because it looked like Dr. M wouldn’t be able to get a new job (the job market SUCKED last year).10 years ago (2000): I thought I’d be living in a small college town walking to work while Dr. M was teaching. It could still happen – if I get a job near his new school. If the economy ever gets better in that area. 15 years ago (1995): I thought I’d be living in western NC somewhere while Dr. M taught high school.20 years ago (1990): I was terribly afraid that I would be a pastor’s wife.25 years ago (1985): I was a junior in college & figured I’d be a high-powered CPA in 2010 (although frankly I couldn’t even IMAGINE being this old!).30 years ago (1980): I was going to be a librarian! Never mind that I could not figure out the Dewey Decimal System to save me…35 years ago (1975): I was almost 11 & really couldn’t think beyond my next book. But I’m pretty sure that when I imagined a future career it was in a library.I’m noticing that all of my dreams after I met Dr. M revolve around his career. Hmmm. I’ve always had trouble figuring out what I want to do with my life (ever since I nixed the CPA thing – whew!). Perhaps now, at 45, it’s time to clean the rust off that area of my brain…P.S. When  I scanned in the 4th grade picture I realized that there is a blob of ink on my nose. I can't tell if this ink was put on the picture after the fact or if I actually had ink on my nose when the picture was taken. Guess I'll have to see if there are other copies at Daddy's house. Heh. I tried to fix it but all my efforts made me look like I had three nostrils. I decided to leave it, because I was the kid who might have absent-mindedly put an open pen in my nose. Just sayin."},

Anyway, on this particular occasion we were having a going away party for one of the missionaries and a volunteer. We had a great time with a meal and a program. I was innocently enjoying all the fellowship. Then I was told to go outside to look at my truck (a Toyota double-cab). This is what I saw:Yes, that is newspaper filling the double-cab truck.I had some help with the cleanup. The whole mission had been saving up newspapers for weeks.I got distracted. What? I love comics!These are the culprits - two MKs home on a school break. I look like an idiot because one of them had just gooched me in the side right as the picture was taken.

If you want to participate just go to Linda's site to link up.1. Do you find it gross to share drinks with family? Friends? Nope. Drinking after each other. Eating from the same bowl. Sharing a tortilla chip. It’s all good. In fact, Dr. M has to get on me about drinking after him when he’s sick. It never enters my mind that I too could get sick. I’m a ditz.2. What have you learned this year? (You didn't see a question of that weight coming, did you? At least not for #2.) I wish I could say that I’ve learned something concrete – like Spanish. I did learn that I like living in a house – I always thought I’d be an apartment or condo person. And maybe after this winter & having to keep up with snow removal (I do plan to help sweetie!) I will change my mind. But right now – being able to howl with laughter & not worry about neighbors? Priceless. 3. When do you dismantle the Christmas decorations? Well, we aim for sometime in January. One year we left the tree up until MLK day (3rd Monday in January for non-US folks). 4. Something you wish to accomplish before the end of 2009 is: Clean out Dr. M’s office!   5. How do you feel about winter (after Christmas)? It’s not my favorite time of year. I really hate having to bundle up to go everywhere. But I just focus on my birthday (March 3) and soldier on… 6. Have you participated in after-Christmas sales? Not intentionally. Dr. M & I stopped by a craft gallery on Saturday & got a Christmas CD 60% off.7. Do you have plans for New Year's Eve? I have a really strong goal of being able to stay awake until midnight. I may have to drink caffeine after 4:00 in order to accomplish that goal. 8. Is there anything special awaiting you in January? Adhering to a new budget so we can eventually afford to replace our Jeep (it’s getting kind of scary to drive). Woo hoo!9. If your life this year was a movie, what category or genre would it be? (Romance, Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Suspense, Farcical, etc.) Drama with a few comedic episodes. 10. How much time per day do you spend blogging? Please do not lie. I will know. Well, when I’m at work I probably spend about three hours a day reading other folks blogs. I get bored in my job. Writing my own blog? Not really that much – maybe three hours per week, depending on how prolific I am.11. Who runs your household? Dr. M! He just wishes I’d get up off my hiney & DO something every now & then. Actually, we’re fairly evenly divided on tasks & such. I do defer to him with some decisions out of laziness or due to his superior knowledge. Some feminist I am!12. Share one hope/dream for 2010. Clean out Dr. M’s office! (Did you think we’d actually get it done this week?).To summarize (stealing this idea from AmyRo!): I need to get busy cleaning out Dr. M’s office, stop futzing with blogging at work, stay AWAY from the office café where I spend way too much money, and keep my grubby mouth off of other people’s food!"},

We had a good visit with Dr. M’s mom. She knew who he was & practically levitated out of her wheelchair when she saw him. That was nice. Both our trip down & our trip back were uneventful – we got to look at lots of snow without being inconvenienced by it. I avoided the infamous Mile Marker 59 Rest Area. I’m glad I did the Christmas poem countdown – my family enjoyed it – but I’m ready to have a little variety on the blog now. I have to say that it was much more difficult to prepare those posts than I thought it would be. I hadn’t realized how many years we were working so hard to find the joy. And I didn’t even mention all of the problems with Dr. M’s family (health issues for parents and brother and sister-in-law). I guess we’re normal – almost everyone has drama in their lives – but I had created a nice little cocoon for myself so that I’m not bombarded on a daily basis (yes, I know that this is called “compartmentalization” or “denial” but it works for me LOL). I am extra grateful for my job today. Sometimes I wish I had something a little more intellectually stimulating, but I realize how fortunate I am to have the job that I do. I will probably still complain when I get bored (my Myers Briggs score indicates that I’m a “present moment person” so I have a hard time remembering good intentions), but I will still be so very glad to have my job!I have a very special post in mind for later this week.

How ill I becomeAt such a thought.On 9-11, God, Spirit, SonSurely sighed and trembledAnd cried for what thoseMisguided children had done.This Christmastide,Spread far and wide God’sGood news, a message not new, Yet what can we do but sing it?

Ere long you will hear it:A song, carried by the wind.Did it all begin with God singing?And look, there, low In the twilit sky, a strange new star Signals us with its twinkling light; We must not fight its call.But where, how long?The song does not say.It only beckons:Come, follow me and see.And so we walk, alone, but lonelyNo longer, for the song and the lightGrow stronger and brighterWith each passing day.I think, this time,We might find the long-awaited gift:The Promised One whose loveWill lift our hearts and souls to God.Above the tumult and the strife, I hear its music ringing!It sounds an echo in my soul.

That first Christmas our friends and family were lucky just to see our smiling faces - we were writing thank you cards, not Christmas cards. The next year, 1991, we wrote personal notes in the form of poems in select Christmas cards. Foolishly, we did not keep a copy of what we wrote. Who knows - it might have been pure genius! It could happen. 1992 began a tradition that we continue today - sending out a poem with our Christmas cards. Some years are harder than others. We alternate who is the primary author (I keep a score card - of course!). Some poems get heavily edited by the non-author and are true collaborations. Some go out just as they were written. And at this point in the game, all I really remember is who wrote the first version. The way you can tell who wrote which poem is to note whose name is listed first at the end.

{"title": "Sundays in Zambia", "date": "Sunday, December 6, 2009", "text": "This will be my last Sunday in Zambia until the new year. Starting on Tuesday I'm posting all the poems Dr. M & I have sent out for last 17 years - plus the one for this year which is has yet to be written. Ideas anyone?I think I mentioned before that I would probably skip around some with these posts. I always think of my mother a LOT at Christmas, so I decided to skip to the visit that she & Mamaw (my dad's mother) made to Zambia while I was there. Most of the text of this post was written for the photo album - I'm just cutting & pasting. Although I'm going to add a couple of bits that I left out the first go round.Mom and Mamaw came to visit for two weeks in January 1988. We had a wonderful time—even though finding food for them to eat was a challenge (well, it was a challenge when the missionaries didn’t feed us). I took them to Kitwe to meet a missionary couple from NC. I also took them to Victoria Falls. We had great adventures on that trip:Let’s see, first on the way there I had to give a soldier from one of the checkpoints a lift…I sang the national anthem while I was driving: “Stand & sing of Zambia, proud & free.” I think he thought I was a little strange. Hoof and Mouth disease was prevalent in the country at that time, so along the way we had to stop to place our naked feet into a tub of grimy looking water that supposedly had disinfectant in it. Eww!Then when we were almost there I started feeling really sleepy. This made me want to drive very fast (reportedly 170 kpm, but that can’t be right!) to get there quicker. I thought Mom & Mamaw exercised great restraint when all they did was ask if I wanted to stop & rest awhile. Oh yes, I wanted to stop on a deserted road in Africa when night was approaching…  Note: Mom wrote this on a postcard to Daddy: Can't believe it, not one fuss - even about her driving. I close my eyes a lot...Then we went through a little drive-through game park where there were reportedly lions lurking. We didn’t see any--& it was a good thing since we got stuck in the mud. We had to get out & put rocks under the tires to make the Kombi budge… Then when I took them to the market in Victoria Falls Mom pulled out U.S. $ & the little ladies there went crazy—“Come here amai—I have some beautiful goods here!” I told Mom that it was illegal to spend American money here & the ladies just laughed and laughed. They enjoyed seeing me scold my mother. We stayed in a nice cottage while we were at Vic Falls. Mom & I sat on the porch and talked late into the night. The next morning I counted 30 mosquito bites on one leg! I stopped counting at that point.The infamous \"mosquito porch\"The top of the smoke that thunders - with the ever present rainbow...Mom & Mamaw climbing to the platform on the Lookout Tree - you could see the falls from therePretty impressive!Me!Back in Lusaka, we went to a local zoo (a very sad speciman of a zoo) and I took a couple of pictures.Mom at the zooMamaw watching one of the missionary kids pet a deer.One of the missionaries took us all to a local church & then on a tour of the city. She found a place where Mom could (illegally - cameras were NOT allowed downtown!) take a picture of the skyline. After church - Mamaw, my housemate & me to the right of the pictureI loved having them there--& not just because they cleaned the oven & refrigerator while they visited. I was glad to have someone back home who had seen and would understand…Mom writing postcards with my housemate's cat Mpingo."},

Go!” I was covering my eyes. I didn’t turn into an adrenaline junkie until later in life.But I digress.I gained FOUR pounds in the last two weeks. If you do the math that means I am now one pound heavier than when I started this little jaunt. Sigh.I could say, well there was all that pie! And corn pudding! But that doesn’t explain my behavior this past week. I’m not going to list my transgressions, but it wasn’t pretty.I could say, well you know we thought that my mother in law was on the verge of death & then we found out that those predictions were premature (For those who missed my note in my last post, Dr. M’s aunts went to visit his mother on Tuesday and found her sitting in her chair drinking coffee. What? We’ll have to wait until we get down there to see what was really up.).And I am an emotional eater – and lord knows there were a lot of emotions this week.But, you know, I just wanted junk so I ate junk. With forethought. And not only that I didn’t move my body very much. My Gazelle is forlorn.I’m forlorn.But, I promised I wouldn’t lie. And now I promise I won’t quit.

I really want to be like Dorothy because that girl could sing a blue streak, but I like adventures! I would not have been in such a hurry to go home. Which one wanted the brain? The scarecrow? That’s who I am!2. When you're deciding what you're going to wear each morning, which item do you select first? Why? Pants – because I have black pants & brown pants & I have to know which ones are clean before I can tell what top to wear.3. What kind of animal do you think the world could live without? Mosquitos! What purpose do they serve?4. How many Christmas trees are in your home? None yet – but we’re hoping to figure out where to put one this year. The past few years we’ve just put lights on our indoor tree – the apartment was too small for a real tree.5. Would you prefer to be emotionless if it mean you didn't have to feel a heartbreak? I’m partway there anyway – I am really good at compartmentalizing so that I can get through my day. Right now, in the back of my mind, is some anxiety about my mother-in-law, but I’m still able to answer the random dozen! That said, I like to have emotions, even repressed ones, so I wouldn’t want to lose them entirely.[Note: after I wrote this Dr. M received a call from home - apparently his mother wasn't quite ready to go into the good night - today she was sitting up & drinking coffee! Not sure how a person goes from practically lifeless to drinking coffee, but we'll take it!]6. Do you ever experience holiday let-down or depression? Yes, sometimes, but see the answer to #5 – I tend to just focus on spring (Easter is on its way!) & slog my way through. You know, speaking of Easter, it's appropriate to me to feel somber for the time leading up to it - how can I fully appreciate the glory of resurrection without the despair of death (I'm also speaking metaphorically about the rebirth of the the earth)?7. Do you like Michael Jackson's music? Mostly I do, although it’s not a style that I listen to much anymore. But I totally had the Thriller album. Didn't everyone?8. Why is it that we never judge people who have their teeth fixed for cosmetic reasons, but every other cosmetic procedure has a stigma? That is an excellent question! I guess we’re all hypocrites? Hmmm. I think that, in my case, I needed braces for good dental hygiene – even Glide floss wasn’t going to get between those babies. Also, I looked like a rabbit.9. Enjoy horseback riding? My backside hurts just thinking about it. I’ve been on a horse twice in my life. Once on my cousin’s horse where he just led the horse around the yard, & then at 4-H camp in the 4th grade (this was the camp experience where I didn’t bathe for an entire week, but that’s another blog post). They put me on a horse that would follow the others & we TROTTED for an hour. Ow ow ow!10. Shoes--practical or stylish? Practical. I used to go for really cute shoes – but never with very high heels because that was just begging for a twisted ankle. Now they have to have support because of my arthritis. Sigh. 11. What was the name of your first pet? Feel free to post a pic. The first one I remember is Alexander. I think he was at least part border collie. I wish I had a picture of him! My brother & I chose the name because we thought it sounded regal. At least that’s how I remember it, but I was probably 5 or 6 at the time, so who knows! The dog before Alexander was Blackie. I don't remember him, but there's a funny story about my Mom calling him right as a person of color was walking down the road by our house. Ouch! She was pretty mortified.12. What percentage of your Christmas shopping is done? Hmm. I have 12 people to shop for (not counting the nephews – they’re getting cash!) & I’ve gotten gifts for 1. So that’s 8%. What day is it? Should I be concerned?"},

But let me tell you, there are not very many homes along I-77, I-64 or I-35. Very dark country that is (except for the gleaming capital dome in Charleston, WV). So I spent a lot of time keeping deer watch. Thankfully, the ones that we saw decided not to have a close encounter with our windshield.Lastly, an open letter to a rest area.Dear Mile Marker 59 Rest Area:You are beautiful to behold. Your landscaped grounds are soothing and lovely. Your automatic toilet paper, automatic flush, automatic water, automatic soap & automatic hand dryer are wonderfully hygienic. There’s just one problem. I might be am probably exaggerating, but I do believe that walking the length of a football field and up a number of steps to get to your facility is cruel & unusual punishment. I waited for two hours to get to you. Do you really think that I should have to earn Weight Watchers Activity Points just to make use of your services?

We’re going to my Dad’s for thanksgiving & I’m pretty sure it will be traditional. I’m not making a thing. Well, I might make my chocolate chip pumpkin muffins – but we sure won’t need them. My dad’s wife Amy always has enough food for an army - & she’s not the only one cooking. We’re getting the forklift ready to load me into the car when it’s time to come home.2. Tell me something concrete that you're thankful for. (Something you can literally touch, see, etc., not a concept like \"hope.\") I’m thankful for Dr. M’s job & our new life in our new town. We’ve waited a lot of years to get to this point – I’m so glad we’re not disappointed in the results!3. You knew the flip side was coming: Share about something intangible that you're thankful for. I’m thankful for the resilience of the human spirit. We always yearn and that alone can pull us up from the depths. 4. Share one vivid Thanksgiving memory. It doesn't have to be deep or meaningful, just something that remains etched in your memory. Until recent years, Dr. M &I spent many Thanksgivings with just each other. I remember the year we decided to have a traditional meal that we gave each other. Well, we didn’t cook a whole turkey, but we fixed the things we wanted. I enjoyed how the day felt special with just the two of us.5. What is one thing that you know beyond a shadow of a doubt is going to happen this Thanksgiving because it always does, year after year? I will try valiantly to not overeat & I will fail miserably. Daddy – you do have plenty of Tums on hand don’t you? Also, my sister-in-law B will try to get me to go shopping with her the day after. I say “a pox on thee!” Not gonna happen. No way. No how. Maybe.6. Do your pets get any left-overs? Yep – Daddy’s two outside dogs will have quite a feast!7. Does your family pray before the big meal? If so, do you join hands while seated, stand, repeat a formal prayer or offer a spontaneous prayer? Who does the praying? Yes, we always pray. We’ll all stand around trying to decide & then make Vivian pray. Or maybe Ken. We’ll see.8. Will you be watching football in the afternoon? If not, what will you be doing? We’ll probably be eating while the football is on. And we might have the TV on in the background. Go Raiders! Let’s win two in a row! Wow, that would make the season 4 & 7!9. There are two distinct camps of people on this issue: How do you feel about oysters in the dressing/stuffing? I don’t like stuffing (after years of trying to figure out how I couldn’t like a dish made of bread I finally realized that I don’t like sage) and I don’t like oysters, so I’m going with no!10. Do you consider yourself informed about the first Thanksgiving? Yes I do – just got a refresher from some blog recently… hmmm… who was it? Oh yeah – Brenda at Days of my Life! 11. Which variety of pie will you be enjoying? All of them! But especially pecan (the ooey gooey Karo Syrup kind!). And if there isn’t pecan pie I will cry.12. Do you feel for the turkey?? (This is a humorous throw back question related to the 12th question in another Random Dozen!) Nope! I’m not a huge turkey eater anyway – I might go with the ham this year. Or, you know, I might eat both. Who am I kidding? It’ll be both. Boy, I already feel REALLY full!Looking back on these answers I think I need to do an intervention with myself regarding the holiday. Here are some rules guidelines:• I’m going to be there until Sunday. There is no need to eat EVERYTHING in one sitting. Pace myself.• Focus on spending time with family instead of on the food (this will be HARD).• We focus a lot on giving thanks to God, & that’s GOOD, but I want to remember to personally thank the people too."},

She was part of a singing group, Love Ministry, and asked me if I wanted to participate. I love music & sang a lot at church so I thought it would be a lot of fun. It was fun, but I have no rhythm. As in they were swaying left & I was swaying right. I stood out like a sore thumb. And I couldn’t really sing at the level of these folks. So I only did it for a short while. On this particular day I was invited along for their annual picnic. I can’t remember where we went, but there was obviously a body of water there. It was a day trip so it was close to Lusaka. We had a lot of fun. We ate food, I assume, although I don’t remember what & I don’t have any pictures us eating (which is VERY strange because I tend to remember food before I remember faces). We played a string game where we worked in pairs trying to extricate ourselves from each other. That was hilarious. We went on a boat ride. I got a really bad sunburn (you can see in one picture where they made me put my chitengi on my head to protect my face & arms). And (this is where you can tell this outing happened in Africa & not NC) I got infested with putzi flies. I tell that story here. We don’t really want to go into all that again right now, do we?"},

This morning in the shower I was debating whether or not to shave my legs. Would that small amount of hair make a difference? I decided that grooming is good whatever the result (right).On the way to work I did not eat my breakfast, and only took small sips of water. I decided that not only did my jeans not feel looser – they feel tighter than they did last week (yes I wore the same jeans – to be consistent!).I walked into A’s office with trepidation & started disrobing. Off went the boots, the earrings, the lanyard, the jacket. And with one eye shut I stepped on the scale. I may have fleetingly thought about lying to you guys if I didn’t like the number. Fleetingly. Really.I’m three pounds down (if I were lying it would be more like 1 pound – no one who knows me would believe THREE).I’ve been thinking about why the number means so much to me. Why I compulsively need to step on the scale at least once a day. Why I have my weigh in rituals & why I feel cheated when I’m unable to do any of the rituals.I’m a Weight Watchers warrior, a veteran. And I know my body. In order to live a normal life while also trying to be healthy I typically lose less than a pound a week. Sure those ounces add up. And after 160 of them are gone I can actually tell in my clothes. But for me those 10 pounds might take three or more months. That’s a long time to keep doing what you’re doing without some tangible result. If I didn’t record those ounces on a weekly basis I would just give up on week two, convinced that nothing was happening.I want to be healthy & eat good things for my body. But right now, with 60 pounds to lose & arthritis in my hip, my priority is to lose weight. It’s gonna be a long slow haul people – I hope you’re prepared to hear my weigh in ritual story every week. And I promise to not lie. If I gain, I’ll tell you. If I lose .2 (a regular happening in the past), I’ll tell you. If I lose three pounds again, I’ll faint first, then I’ll tell you!Note: I won’t be in the office next week so I won’t be weighing in. Sure my Dad has a scale. But am I making myself crazy by weighing in the day after Thanksgiving? Not a chance!"},

The last time I saw my surgeon, a month ago, he took my arm & moved it around & seemed displeased with my progress - & told me that swimming would be the best thing for me! The next day I asked my physical therapist about swimming – he said that I was not ready to try to do that yet. Which is good, because I’m not sure how I was going to manage to swim without putting my arm over my head – maybe the butterfly, or that Australian crawl? I don’t swim well at the best of times – I can just see the fiasco that would be the Bug in the pool with no overhead arm motion. Cleanup in Lane 5!That made me feel a bit better about my progress – as usual, the surgeon is pie in the sky & why aren’t you swimming the English Channel, whereas reality is are you able to pull your hair back in a ponytail yet (the answer is yes!). Yesterday I saw my surgeon again for another follow-up. They took an x-ray which apparently looked fabulous. He said, how bout we say I’ll see you when I see you! I thought that sounded extra fine. But there was the little matter of my physical therapist’s recommendation that I have another 6 weeks of therapy. And the fact that Dr. M & I had already discussed that I wasn’t quite where I wanted to be. So I told Dr. Surgeon that I thought I wanted to follow my PT’s advice. He agreed – admitting that the PT knows best at this point (duh!).But then I’m DONE. Whatever my arm can do after six more weeks is what it can do. I’ll keep doing my home exercises, but as of Christmas, I’m finished with going somewhere I pay people to torture me. Merry Christmas to me!This photo is from Christmas 2006 - note the doll on the dresser - my cousin the potter made the head & hands, & her mother made the dress from pieces of my Mom's wedding dress. Yes, that's supposed to be me - I think it's a pretty good likeness, but I'm afraid someone will use it as a voodoo doll someday."},

But I would LOVE to be a world-class ping pong player. Wow, I really am super geek.2. When you make a major purchase, do you go with your gut instinct, or do you do research to make an informed decision? I make Dr. M do the research & then he’s the one who gets to decide since he did all the work. I know, a major cop out! I think if I had to do it myself I would narrow down my choices with research & then go with my gut instinct to make the final selection.3. There is an old kids' game that says you can find out what your movie star name would be by using your middle name as your first name and the name of the street you grew up on as your last. What is your movie star name? Well, this isn’t much fun – my maiden name is Wallace & the street I grew up on was Wallace Dairy Road! So I’d be Marie Wallace Dairy. Heh. Sounds like a character actor to me.4. Would you rather give up your favorite music or your favorite food? This is hard! I rarely listen to music since I listen to books on tape – but I don’t know that I’d want to give any of it up. But food! For my health I should say I’d give up the food. This is my not happy to give up food face.5. There are two types of banana preferences. One is pristine yellow, almost to the point of being green; the other is spotty and more ripe. Which is your preference? Banana bread! No? Ok, then it needs to be ripe enough that you can actually peel the thing, but I don’t like brown spots.6. Your favorite tree is? Christmas tree!7. On a scale of 1-10, how tech savvy are you? I’m an 8 I think – except that I’m not moving with the times. I don’t know how to text, twitter or DVR.8. Has H1N1 touched your family? Not that I know of – yet!9. Are you an analytical person, or do you just accept things the way they are without questioning or scrutinizing? Analytical – this was especially evident when I was a child & had all these questions about the Bible…10. Is your personality more like that of a dog, cat, or Koala? Hmmm, another toughie. I’m going to go with cat – leave me alone & let me do my thing. I’m gonna do it behind your back anyway…11. Do you keep in touch with friends you made years ago? Yes - three friends from college (well, one of them is my cousin Kim so I’ve known her from birth). We try to get together around Christmas every year to have a meal & exchange gifts. I missed the year I was in Zambia, but I don’t remember missing any others. So that’s, what 25 years now? Hi Sherri & Jenny & Kim (and assorted hangers on otherwise known as your families)! Have you bought your ornaments yet? I have perused, but not purchased...12. You are checking out at a grocery store. In the express lane, there are more people than the regular lanes, but of course, their load is less than those in the regular lanes. Which lane do you choose (assuming you qualify for the express lane) and why? I go with the self checkout lane. Oh, that wasn’t an option? Boy you’re strict. The express lane for me – I just think it will go faster than the grocery carts filled to the brim.OK, now it's time to announce the winner of the I Won, You Win carnival. I put all six of the names in a lovely pottery basket & made Dr. M do the honors. The winner is Amy!! Congratulations!P.S.

And I won! I know, I was amazed too. The prize was the opportunity to read a book (Sisterchicks in Wooden Shoes by Robin Jones Gunn), make notes about the parts I liked best, & then pass it along to another \"Sisterchick.\" Here is Robin's original concept:As I finished the book up the other day I began to think about the two women the story centers around.The story begins with two pen pals in elementary school and they continue with there friendship for many, many years through letters and emails, but they have never actually met, not until things change for the main character. Her life takes an unexpected turn and she finds herself face to face with her long time pen pal.I began to think of the similarities between the two women in the book and all of you, my fellow bloggers.As members of this unique internet community we enter into each other lives as we read each others posts, as we comment, share encouraging words or just a well needed giggle now and then.But what I enjoyed as I read this book was the depiction of the friendship these two women shared. They had been intimately involved in each other lives but had never been in the same room with each other, never shared a cup of coffee over the kitchen table, never wept in each other arms. Yet they still shared in the deep bonds of friendship.The relationship the two women in this book have is a real friendship, as real as friendships get.I found the similarities between the book and the blogosphere to almost mirror each other.The idea for “I Won…You Win” is two fold.Once a winner is chosen I will send the book out into the blogosphere.My hope is that whoever wins it will keep the “I Won…You Win” giveaway going.The second requirement is once you have finished the book place your blog address on the inside cover, as well as the date you finished the book and then continue the “I Won…You Win” Giveaway on your blog.Link back to me in your giveaway. Let’s see where this takes us.I also want to encourage everyone who reads the book to mark your favorite chapter in the book with a note in the margin telling future readers why you enjoyed the chapter. Use your imagination, tuck a special note in the pages or a pretty bookmark, but put “yourself” somewhere in the pages of the book.I am so excited to send this out into the blogosphere.Let the giveaway begin!I’ve finished the book (a quick and enjoyable read) & I’m ready to pass it along. If you’d like to participate, just leave a comment, with the answer to the following question. Dental Floss: Waxed, or not?I’ll announce the winner on the Wednesday meme. Good luck!"},

Suffice it to say that there were canceled flights, icy airports, lost luggage, coin operated showers, and sleeping on top of carry-on bags involved. I thought that perhaps you might be wondering when is she ever going to post some pictures of Zambia? Is this, or is this not, supposed to be a Sunday in Zambia? Okay, okay, here you go!One of the first things I had to do once I arrived (other than learn my actual job & borrow clothes from my house-mate Rebecca until my luggage arrived) was to find a church. I know! I was amazed that I wouldn’t be able to sleep in on Sundays too! I visited a lot of different churches, or maybe two. There was the bigger congregation where the pastor was one of the missionaries. It had a lot of diversity – missionary families and Zambians. But it reminded me too much of the churches back home. I wanted something different. And there was the church where Rebecca taught Sunday School – a tiny concrete block with a dirt floor. There was a lot of joy in that church, but they didn’t really need me. I ended up going to the small informal Bible study that the campus ministry missionary had for the University of Zambia students. They wanted me to play piano. I was adequate not too bad TERRIBLE. And I wasn’t very good at teaching or leading Bible studies either. Really, what I was good at, was my job. Witnessing & what one would consider to be traditional mission work? Not so much. I’ve always wondered what strange magic made the Foreign Mission Board pick me for this work. Perhaps that magic was God.I didn’t take any pictures at the student center (what the heck!), so here are some pictures from the church where Rebecca taught."},

I’m not sure the number means anything though. What that number tells me is that I am ignoring my body. Since I plan to keep using it for another good long while I had BETTER get with the program – any program! My program of choice is Weight Watchers (online) – Bug Style. I’m going to be weighing in on Fridays with a coworker in her office (yes, she keeps a scale in her office - heh). We’re both pretty determined to try to be healthier. That’s my goal this time around – I want to lose weight, sure, but I want to eat right & exercise too. If those two things can become a habit then I’ll be able to keep this up because it really is a lifestyle change, not a diet.I’ll be posting my results each Friday. The whole post might be about how evil food is (food isn't really evil, I know - but it does have a siren call for me), or it might be about something else with a footnote. But I’m going to make my commitment to better health public & that means you’re my witnesses. You lucky dogs!Here are a couple of images to help with my motivation.

After an eternity of discussing the whys & wherefores he said, “You still seem angry.” I said, “I’m not angry – I’ve been done with this argument for a while & I’m annoyed that we’re still talking about it.” I told him that as usual in this case I’m the man and he’s the woman. He likes to get to the heart of a matter. I just want to say I’m mad & move on. I think it’s because he’s a professor – talking about stuff is his job & he’s really good at it!I would really like to take him out to dinner tonight to celebrate his birthday. He got birthday money from my aunt M – we can afford it! He’s the cook in the family. There’s a reason for that. I could possibly boil pasta. And heat some sauce. Or put the frozen pizza in the oven. Hmm. I’m thinking Mexican – what do you think sweetie?Twenty years ago I gave him a birthday gift for the first time. It was something special to us - & remains an important symbol of how we “get” each other. This year’s gift is more whimsical, but another example of how we get each other – strange obsessions and all (remember, he got to drive the car that said OPUSLUST on the license plate). I should have gotten him a personalized plate – SHEEP1ST. Heh.Although we’ve had lots of hard things happen during our marriage, none of those things has touched our marriage. We are one for all and all for one. Even before those vows joined us together. They were just words – affirming what we already knew. Happy birthday dear heart."},

Have you ever had “buyer’s remorse” over anything? All. The. Time. Very rarely do I NOT have buyer’s remorse. There’s the bag that was supposed to keep my lettuce fresh (not!). The cute little MP3 player that I used for a minute because the toggle switch was too hard to operate. The Weight Watchers membership that I just ignored for three months (I’m starting fresh on Friday – really!). And most recently, the Snickers bar I ate yesterday.3. What is something in your life that you are thankful for now that you didn’t think you would be at the time of the event? (Something that seemed ill-timed, inconvenient or hurtful which turned out to be a good thing) Dr. M had an interview at a college in Lancaster, SC. They wanted someone to teach a different subject than the one that is his specialty, so we weren’t sure why they were interviewing him. It’s close to family, so despite the fact that he would have been teaching something unfamiliar & that it’s hot as you know what there, we were really putting a lot of hope into the job. Thank goodness they didn’t hire him! I think that where he is now is perfect. Someday it would nice to live closer to our families, but this is where we’re supposed to be right now.4. Do you watch the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade every year? If so, do you have a favorite float or balloon? I only watch if someone else has it on. I have a love/hate relationship with parades. I enjoy the floats, but for some reason the idea of a parade makes me sad. I haven’t really analyzed this phenomenon so I don’t know why.5. Share a quote, scripture, poem or lyric which has been an inspiration to you lately. I’m reading Sisterchicks in Wooden Shoes (which I won from Linda). I’m almost done and I’ll be passing it along next week sometime. Today I read a passage where the main character was talking about the “sacredness of the everyday.” For some reason that reminds me of my meditation workshop where we were taught mindfulness. Can I be present in each moment? Can I see the sacred in that moment? Hmm. This needs more thought.6. This is meant to be a fun question, and this is a G-rated blog, but please share a “guilty pleasure,” something that you enjoy that’s probably not the most edifying, time-worthy or healthy thing you could be indulging in. Did I mention--G rating? Chocolate chip cookie dough! I don’t care if it might make me sick (and in fact it HAS made me sick before). It’s my drug of choice…7. What Thanksgiving food are you looking forward to? Corn pudding (are we having it Bren? Seems like I heard a nefarious rumor from Daddy that we weren’t?). If there’s no corn pudding (sigh) then pecan pie is my second favorite.8. What is your favorite book to read to children, or what was your favorite childhood book? Old Black Witch! It might have been all the pancakes, but my brother & I loved this book!9. Do you collect anything? (Feel free to post a photo.) Penguins! This started because I was tired of rainbows (my last great obsession – in high school) & fell in love with Opus from Bloom County. I even had a personalized license plate that read “OPUSLUST.” Heh. Now don’t go sending me every penguin you ever saw – I already have them all! At this point in my penguin career I’m looking for penguin Art. 10. Gift bags or wrapping paper? Wrapping paper.11. Share an after-school memory from when you were younger. What was your routine like on an average day? I have no idea what my routine was last year, much less 30 years ago! But here’s a memory: I rode the bus all four years of high school, so I usually did my homework on the way home. If there was something left undone I would finish my homework on the couch in the living room & either listen to my dad’s Rachmaninoff 8-track tape, or our Captain & Tennille 8-track tape (Muskrat Suzy & Muskrat Sam, doing the jitterbug in Muskrat Land…). 12. True story: Once, in a job interview, I was asked this question and told there would be no clarifying; I simply had to answer the question: “When you’re fishing, do you feel for the fish?” So what about you? When you're fishing, do you feel for the fish?? At first, being me, I answered this literally. I even said that I’m pretty sure I couldn’t eat a fish I caught myself – so, yes, I guess I do feel for the fish! But looking at it from a broader perspective, as perhaps a person who is trying to get something in life - I'd like to think that I feel for the person giving it to me. Not sure how successful I am at that. When I worked in HR I definitely felt for those job candidates who were so desperate for a job - I didn't like rejecting any - & sometimes I didn't like hiring them (because I wasn't sure we were the best fit for them).

All the pictures are being scanned from my scrapbook pages - just in case you wonder about the odd shapes, or captions.Although I don’t plan to necessarily go in chronological order, I decided that I would start near the beginning for this week’s post. My fellow journey-folk & I had 6 weeks of boot camp, er training, in Virginia in the summer of 1986, then were sent home to get ready to head to our respective countries. I was in awe of the folks headed to China & West Africa – those destinations seemed a lot scarier than mine. I was assigned to work in Harare, Zimbabwe – I wasn’t even going to be in the bush! Zimbabwe denied my work permit – rightly saying that they didn’t see why a Zimbabwean couldn’t do the work of secretary-bookkeeper. I waited for four months before the Foreign Mission Board was able to find me a new assignment – Lusaka, Zambia. I found out in November – and after sending all of my paperwork to the Lusaka Baptist Mission twice (they obviously needed my services LOL), I set out on my grand adventure on a plane flying out of the Charlotte, North Carolina airport. Here is what I wrote in my journal that day:Tuesday, January 13, 1987I feel very alone now. God, are you there? Give me strength. Strength to face my impracticalities and do something about them. My carry-on bag will not fit – so I must check it in Atlanta. Why does that bother me so much? Because it makes me feel foolish and I don’t like feeling foolish.Saying goodbye is so hard. I can see Mom & Dad standing at the window and that’s when I start to cry. I’m not supposed to cry – this is my adventure. A year and a half isn’t so very long. It’s time for me to grow up.Sometimes I wonder if I set things in motion just because I know I won’t stop it – and I know it’s good for me. Is this really God’s will for my life? Can I really know the answer?I ended up being able to carry my bag onto the plane in Atlanta – the stewardess was VERY helpful. And this was a good thing, because the airline lost my luggage.

How about a swanky hotel in downtown Cincinnati? Meh. A trip to the casinos? A B&B in Yellow Springs? Or a drive to Young’s Jersey Dairy for excellent ice cream? No no no.I married a historian. I feel slightly lied to because at the time that we met & fell in love he was in seminary. I was bracing myself for life as a church worker’s spouse. I would have been GREAT. No? Really? Whyever not? The Dana Look? Hmmm. Anyway, he saved me from that fate by finding a different kind of calling. This calling is something for which he’s quite well suited - & it saves me from trying to be nice all the time. After all, it’s kind of expected that a University professor and his wife might be a little odd.So we’re celebrating his birthday a week early at a history conference in Louisville. We’ll listen to some of his friends present papers. We’ll stay at the Brown Hotel. We’ll damage our arteries with a Kentucky Hot Brown sandwich. We’ll have some quality time in the car together.

The powdered donuts. Not the eating them part. The part where the powder got ALL OVER my black pants. Not pretty.3. When you reply to someone's comment on your blog, do you reply in your comments or go to her blog and comment? (Or email her) I reply mostly on my blog (when I remember – sorry commenters!). But sometimes I’ll reply on their blog if I happen to be there & remember. 4. Your favorite Disney movie is: Jungle Book. I love Baloo the Bear.5. Do you recycle? Yes! In fact, I think we’ve got more recycling than actual trash. But I shouldn't be all that proud about it because it means we eat more things out of boxes and plastic containers.6. Games of strategy or games of chance? Depends on how sharp I’m feeling at the time – I like both. 7. Do you have any recurring dreams?Yes – I’m in a house with dozens of rooms, all on different levels (two steps up to the kitchen, three steps down to the living room). Depending on the dream I might be trying to cook (ha!), looking for someone, taking care of a baby (yikes!), trying to hide, just hanging out with my mom – but it’s the same house. If I ever found an actual house like it I might run screaming in the other direction!Another recurring dream is where I’m trying to find the bathroom & the only toilet is in the middle of a busy intersection, or out in a store, or you can’t shut the door. This is because I’ve got to GO, & can’t quite get awake enough – thank goodness my subconscious makes it so hard to have any privacy or Dr. M & I might be changing the sheets!8. What did you learn from your first real job? That when I get too comfortable with people I can be really bitchy. I got into trouble with my snarky attitude, but I thought I was friends with the person who was offended. I was really hurt that she didn’t say something to me instead of my boss. It taught me that the workplace is not a place to let down your guard. Then I spent the next 19 years ignoring that bit of wisdom & people learned that I’m just a snarky person. BEWARE THE “DANA LOOK!”9. Do you buy or borrow most books? I buy Nora Roberts books. Other books I get from the library – mostly downloading them in either .pdf or WMA format (so I can read them on my mini-notebook, or listen to them on my MP3 player). Sometimes I check an actual BOOK out of the library!10. What fashion trend of the past did you say you'd never wear again but did? Well, we had 80s day at work & you can see how well THAT worked for me! Sometimes I think about getting a perm again – I spent most of the 80s with permed hair…11. When do you start Christmas shopping? I guess about now. Dr. M likes to wait until the last minute & after almost 19 years of marriage he’s infected me. I do most of our shopping online because I HATE SHOPPING!12. Have you ever been so happy that you literally jumped up and down for a few seconds? If so, what was the occasion? When Dr. M got his job at the university last spring. I walked into my coworkers’ office & they thought I was having an epileptic fit. I may have looked like Elaine from Seinfeld. I was pretty excited."},
{"title": "Sundays in Zambia", "date": "Sunday, November 1, 2009", "text": "I mentioned before that I was thinking about doing some posts on my time in Zambia. I decided that I’ll try to make it a regular weekly feature. We’ll see how that works!I went to Zambia as part of the Journeyman program of the Southern Baptist Church. It was a program designed to use recent college graduates to fill temporary support positions in the foreign mission field. I was the secretary-bookkeeper for the Baptist Mission of Zambia from January 1987 until July 1988. Later I’ll provide more detailed info about what I did & experienced while I was there, but first I want to talk about who I was.Based on what I remember (or don’t) from that time I have to conclude that I was a shallow, unobservant silly girl. I was pretty good at my actual job, but I didn’t have a lot of life experience and I didn’t know how to be really present in the experiences I was having. I was a flibbertigibbet & wasn’t as mindful as I could have been. I had discovered boys while I was in college (late bloomer here!) & I wasn’t done with them yet. I was 22 going on 16. Get the picture?Over 10 years after I returned from Zambia I created a scrapbook (actually two rather large volumes) trying to recreate my experience there. The following is a poem I wrote when I completed the albums. I decided to use it in my first “Zambia Post” as my disclaimer.Who was that girl?Superficial… Boy crazy…with an occasionalflash of insight.I hardly rememberheror what she didthat long agotime in Africa.These are theimages she broughthome with her.These are her stories –remembered as in a dream edited by timereconstructed to suit myself.This is her bookand mine tooWhoever we are!Dana Wallace RhyneMay 17, 1999"},

If you want to participate just go to Linda's site to link up.1. Tell me something about your favorite teacher. Not necessarily my favorite at the time, but one of the most memorable - my seminary Old Testament professor, Sam Ballentine. He was HARD – it’s a miracle I made a B – but he made the Old Testament come alive – it was almost like he was the voice of God speaking to me in the classroom. Spooky, but in a good way.2. Tell me about one pivotal moment in your life. I had been considering the Peace Corps, but I wasn’t a teacher or a builder – I was an Accounting major. One day I was in the Christian Student Center at college & saw a brochure about the Journeyman program. This was a two year mission program for college graduates. It listed bookkeeper right there in the brochure! I applied for the program & ended up in Zambia. This obviously affected my world view (and was the beginning of my bleeding heart liberal self), but it also eventually led me to Dr. M.3. About favorite colors--a lot of people will ask you what it is, but I want to know why it is. What feeling or memory does it evoke? My favorite color is Roy G. Biv. I just can’t decide! But if you’re going to press me I’ll say purple because the amethyst has special meaning for Dr. M & me. 4. What's a sure sign that you're getting older? My arthritis – I’m really salty that it’s worse now that the weather is cooler. Way to be a stereotype Bug! Oh, & the fact that there are people working with me who could be my children. Yikes!5. Please don't sermonize, but Halloween--is it a yes or no for you? Yep! I try to dress up every year (we dress up at work). Here's a picture from 2004.6. What's your favorite musical? The Buffy the Vampire Slayer musical! “I’ve got a theory, it could be bunnies…” 7. Are you more of a city mouse or country mouse? Can’t I be a small town mouse? That’s where I’m most comfortable.8. Did you know that it is possible, for a small fee, to name a real star after someone? (It's true! Google it!) If someone were to name a star for you, would you appreciate it for its whimsy and romance, or would you say, \"Are you kidding me? For $19.95 we could have gone to the movie and actually bought popcorn.\" That would be so excellent! Except I really want a new Prius instead… What do you mean they cost more than $19.95?9. What's the craziest thing you've ever been doing and texted during it? I only thought of this b/c I was about to try to text during my walking video but I didn't. Um, well, I’ve only texted successfully once in my life & it took me 2 hours to say “thinking of u 2day.” 10. \"It's not a party unless _______.\" There’s cake!11. When you're stuck in traffic or a waiting room, what do you do to pass the time? PS: There are no magazines available. In traffic I’m listening to a book on tape. In a waiting room I’ve either brought a book or I play solitaire on my PDA.12. If you weren't yourself, would you be friends with you? I’m thinking not. I would find myself too annoying & off putting. “Boy, that Bug, all she does is talk about herself & whine.” I might friend myself on Facebook though because I think I’m funny.OK, this ends the revealing things about myself trend until next Wednesday. I'll try to be more enigmatic until then."},
{"title": "10 Random Things", "date": "Monday, October 26, 2009", "text": "Lee Ryan from Occasional Notes tagged me for this list. As I was doing it realized that I had already done one several months ago - but I made sure to list 10 new things this time.I stole two grapes from the local fruit stand when I was around four. My mom made me go back in & pay a penny for them. She & the fruit stand lady cried about how cute & pitiful I was. A few years later at that same store my mom told me that I really should be friendlier to people – they were going to think I was stuck up. I told her I was just shy. It was a lie – I was stuck up. If you didn’t live in a book you just weren’t important to me.My mom had a pajama party for me when I was 10 or 11. Late in the night my friends went looking for me. I was in a closet reading a book with a flashlight.All this talk about reading makes it sound like I am really into LIT'rature – but, no. If I have to think about it more than twice your concept is too deep for me. Give me a good Janet Evanovich & let me escape into inanity please!As my family well knows, I have an irrational drive to point out errors – especially in writing. This does NOT mean that I don’t make errors myself! And I don’t really even think about it with my bloggy friends (except – please guys, use “than” instead of “then” when appropriate – it’s become an epidemic!). I recently emailed Tudor’s Biscuit World to inform them that they had a typo on their home page. I just looked & it’s been fixed! Wow – I do exert some influence in the world! (Leave me to my delusions please.)I had such a bad thumb-sucking habit that I slept with a sock on my right hand. In the 6th grade. I was desperate to give up the habit because my thumb was embarrassingly raw in the winter, but I was doing it in my sleep so I didn’t really have control over it. Thumb-sucking medicine didn’t work – it just burned a little & then went away. The sock was MUCH more effective!My first kiss was the summer after I graduated from high school. He was a NC farm boy named Gold. Nice guy, but not really for me. My second kiss was at Myrtle Beach the summer after my freshman year of college & he STUCK HIS TONGUE in my mouth! Ick! I just met you at putt-putt & now you’re trying to… Let’s just say I wasn’t a particularly fast girl at that time LOL.I do not like coffee or alchohol. I lump them in with cabbage & carrots on the list of yucky things in life. But once, a really long time ago, I drank an entire Fuzzy Navel over the course of two hours - & then had the nerve to think I was slightly tipsy. Wonder what would happen if I actually did get tipsy?One day while I was in Zambia I sat in wet grass (here is a picture of me sitting in that grass - look at those ginormous glasses! Looks like I fried my contact lens boiler again). As a result I was infected with Putzi fly larvae. If you would like to read the sordid & disgusting details of such an infestation, go here. I had a strange fascination with plucking the larvae from my skin with tweezers. Unfortunately most of the larvae had ended up in a region that I wasn’t able to reach, so my roommate had to do the honors. Strangely, she did NOT enjoy it as much as I did.Speaking of tweezers, when I was a child I used to like to stick my grandmother’s cactus spines into the tips of my fingers & pull them out with tweezers. No, it didn’t hurt. Yes, even I knew that there was something not quite right about it.Wow – I’m really strange! Perhaps I’m getting a little too comfortable with all this “getting to know you” business. Whatever’s going on it will most likely continue on Wednesday when I do the Random Dozen Meme again. Sorry!"},
{"title": "Halloween Party", "date": "Sunday, October 25, 2009", "text": "Dr. M & I went to a kid-friendly Halloween party yesterday at my old boss’s house. We dressed up, but it turns out that except for our hosts, most of the adults just dressed their kids. Well, we don’t have kids to dress up so we have to spend all that creativity on each other! Dr. M was a Renaissance merchant (he wore this same outfit last week to take his history club students to the local Ren fair) and I was a witchy witch. I just love my Professor McGonagall hat!We had a nice time, but boy was I exhausted. I knew I wasn’t cut out to be a mother, but watching all the mothers run around chasing toddlers just confirmed it. I did have fun with a couple of twin 18-month old girls. They apparently thought I was their watering hole & just walked up & opened their mouths while eyeing my cup. Fortunately I was drinking water & not any of the hard stuff!Here are a handful of pics from the day."},

{"title": "Random Dozen Meme", "date": "Tuesday, October 20, 2009", "text": "If it's Wednesday, it must be time for the Random Dozen Meme from \"Lidna\" at 2nd Cup of Coffee. If you want to participate just go to Linda's site to link up.1. Candy corn: Your thoughts? Nectar of the gods…2. Briefly, what was the first conversation you ever had with your spouse? (or best friend, if you're not married.) (Or someone significant, like your librarian.) He was wearing overalls & sitting in the floor of the seminary library and was discussing the merits, or lack thereof, of using PVC pipes for wind chimes. I think. And, no, this did not immediately make me think, “Here is the individual I’m going to spend the rest of my life with!” It took a few months of ping pong & deep conversation for that to happen.3. Could you ever become a vegetarian? I like vegetarian food well enough that I would be pretty happy going without meat (but not dairy or eggs!), but I’d have to be a LOT more intentional about feeding myself - & we’d totally have to change the places we like to eat. 4. Have you ever dressed up your pet in a costume? We don’t have any pets, but I dressed a stuffed dog in a baseball uniform. And we have one of those geese who has an outfit for every month – she’s a witch right now, but I don't have a picture of her in that outfit - so here's August.5. Name something about childhood that you miss (like Clark Bars, Teaberry Gum, Malibu Barbie, cracking fake eggs on people's heads with your fist and \"It's the Great Pumpkin\" airing only once a year). Cadging a bite of my mom’s oatmeal cake & a sip of her Pepsi – it tasted extra special because it was hers.6. Have you ever won a trophy? If not, what do you deserve a trophy for? I think my softball team got trophies the one year I played, but I’m not sure why. Probably for showing up to play. I was TERRIBLE! I was tall for my age (stopped growing in the 5th grade – I was 5’4”) and they expected that I could hit the ball a long way. And I actually couldn’t hit past the pitcher. It was as effective as a bunt, but then I couldn’t really run the bases very well either. Can I read a book now?7. When do you think is the appropriate time to begin playing Christmas music each year? The day after Thanksgiving. I try to be very strict so that I don’t burn out.8. What's your favorite board game? Trivial Pursuit! The original version where I have a slight chance of actually beating you.9. How do you feel about surprises (receiving, not giving)? Depends on the surprise, but usually it amazes me to have someone think enough about me to surprise me so I’m pleased. That sounds pathetic, but I have self-esteem issues. Don't hassle me. 10. Is it easy for you to say, \"I'm sorry?\" Yes, but then I almost always follow up with, but it really wasn’t my fault because of this or that. Trying to break that habit.11. What is your favorite candle scent? Pumpkin Spice12. October is traditionally \"open house\" time in public schools. If you had a literal open house in your home (like a reception) what light snacks would you serve visitors and what would you show them (as in art projects, graded papers) that would uniquely represent you? Dr. M would go overboard on cheeses, crackers, dips, chips & salsa, and then I would make this great recipe for cake balls from Kelly’s blog. I would show off my photo albums, and we would leave the computer on so we could show all of our pictures (yes, we’re those people). If the weather was nice we would show off our garage – we’re so excited to have one! And we would show off our flowers."},
{"title": "Just Another Afternoon at the Castle", "date": "Sunday, October 18, 2009", "text": "Dr. M & I had a really nice day yesterday roaming around the Ohio countryside. The day was beautiful – if just a bit chilly (in the 50s & windy). We had to make a “quick” trip to Cincinnati in the morning & made it to Dr. M’s school at the end of the 4th quarter of the homecoming game. His team won! Always nice to win your game on homecoming. After standing by the field for about 5 minutes I was quite grateful for that unexpected trip to Cincinnati in our warm car – not sure I would have survived sitting on those cold exposed stands for the whole game! I was ill-prepared for the chill – even though I thought I was. Next game I’m taking my version of the Snuggie! There will be a whole post dedicated to this garment in the near future. After the game was over we headed to West Liberty, Ohio to visit the Piatt Castles for their Halloween program: Ghosts & Goblins, Literature to Scare & Delight. We had a great time. It’s a program really designed for children – there were games & scary stories from 19th century poems – but Dr. M & I enjoyed the old house and the staff dressed in their ghostly costumes. They put on a play about a ghost wedding, and there was a tour of the spooky basement. Then we all stood around warming our knickers by a bonfire. We each made a wish & threw parsley into the fire. I’m not telling you what my wish was! I did make sure that this was not some sort of fertility ritual. Heh.The program was held at Mac-A-Chee castle. The other castle, Mac-A-Cheek, is about a mile away. The names are derived from a Shawnee village called Mackachack. Construction on the homes began in the 1860s. They’re not actual castles – they are chateaux built in a gothic design. Perfect for Halloween! Note - this tiny history lesson is courtesy of Wikipedia and the Piatt Castles website. Please visit those sites for more information. They’re having the same program next Saturday beginning at 4:30 – if you’re in the area check it out! *There is an admission fee."},
{"title": "Hangman", "date": "Friday, October 16, 2009", "text": "I spend a lot of time working puzzles. I love cryptograms & cryptoquotes & word searches & jumbles & picture puzzles… It’s vastly entertaining to me to bring order out of chaos (too bad that doesn’t translate to bringing order out of our house’s chaos – sorry sweetie). Well, this week I’ve been totally fascinated with Hangman. It’s the only puzzle I can do at work – my other puzzle site has been banned. Lately, with my overdose of hangman I’m really noticing how my brain works. Or not really how it works so much as that it works. I see the spaces for the letters and I type “a e i” until there are enough vowels to work with (I’ve decided that it’s now legal to end a sentence with “with.” So there.). Then I type “s t r l m n” and see what’s there. And usually – 99% of the time – I have the word figured out by then. It’s like Wheel of Fortune without Pat & Vanna (do they still do Wheel of Fortune?). And I am the Queen of this little game. But I wonder. What is all this frantic letter tapping about, really? I’m a great one for not delving too deeply. I know there are worries at the corners – if I turn my head quickly I’m sure I’ll see them face-on. But I think my worries are all constructed of Paper Mache – a good rain would turn them to mush that I could sweep out the back door. So right now I’m looking straight ahead. I’m watching words formed out of thin air. Let’s keep the little bugger from getting hanged, shall we?"},
{"title": "Random Dozen Meme", "date": "Tuesday, October 13, 2009", "text": "If it's Wednesday, it must be time for the Random Dozen Meme from \"Lidna\" at 2nd Cup of Coffee. I tried to be a little more succinct this week. P.S. - if you want to participate just go to Linda's site to link up.1. I've always wondered why we were taught both printing and cursive. Do you prefer to print or write cursive? (Keyboard is not a choice.) Well, actually I do both. In the same word. Just look at the word “bacon” in this post. I wonder what that says about me?2. Are you a dreamer or a realist? Realistic dreamer? I try not to dream about things that couldn’t possibly happen. Well, except for winning the lottery. But that could happen – really!3. Billy Joel or Elton John? Billy! I like Elton better now that I’m older, but I think Billy still wins.4. What is the scariest movie you've ever seen? Not limited to horror flicks but also includes ones where the tension or suspense is killer, for example, Flightplan (2005): A bereaved woman and her daughter are flying home from Berlin to America. At 30,000 feet the child vanishes and nobody admits she was ever on that plan. Nightmare on Elm Street. Because I felt like it could really happen. Who’s to say what might infiltrate our dreams? 5. Now what is the scariest real-life moment you've had? That time in Zambia (or maybe Zimbabwe – doesn’t that sound exotic?) when Mom & Mamaw & I were stuck in the game preserve & I had to get out & stuff rocks under the Kombi’s tires just to get the thing to get out of the mud. And there were lions in that park (not that we ever saw any – they were probably offended by my language). But the threat of lions was enough to get my heart pounding!6. What word do you misspell without fail? It used to be “definite” but I did it so often that I finally learned it!7. Name something you like to do but are not really talented or good at. Bowling! I really enjoy it, but I have a wicked hook I've never tamed. And never really tried (sorry Daddy) - trying would take all the fun out of it!8. Do you get your emotional/mental batteries recharged by being around people or by having alone time? Leave me alone! Please – just let me finish reading this paragraph/chapter/book and I promise I’ll pay you some attention…9. Have you ever been on TV? Nope! And there was a big sigh of relief…10. Apple or pumpkin pie? (Don't be greedy.) Apple – can I have some right now?11. How many magazine subscriptions do you have? Too many! Self, More, Guideposts, Greenprints, Weight Watchers, Blue Ridge Country, National Parks, Our State... I always order when the kids come round… But I’m trying to let them die (the magazine subscriptions, not the kids) to gear up for the next round. The only one I won’t do without is Greenprints. Yes, I know it’s a gardening magazine. Yes, I know I don’t have a garden & don’t really like getting dirt under my nails. Your point is?12. What lesson do you have to keep re-learning? That I do not get the flu once per month. It always sneaks up on me – about every third month I tell Dr. M that I think I have a fever & feel achy. That I’m pretty sure it’s the flu. Sigh."},

There were some pretty leaves, but we figure next week will be the most beautiful – just in time for homecoming at Dr. M’s school. I’m already trying to figure out how to look lovely & still be warm for the game. I think a turtleneck might be involved.We stopped for some ice cream (black cherry chocolate chunk – oh my!) at Young’s Jersey Dairy and got some pictures of the animals & general mayhem. On the way home we stopped by the Tecumseh Land Trust (home of all the gorgeous sunflowers from the other week). And then took a turn through an old cemetery. And look! It’s sort of a family joke that everywhere we go there is a cannon. As the wife of a historian I have quite a collection of pictures of them. I’m just surprised that Dr. M didn’t get out of the car to pose with it. I’m almost ready to let summer go. Almost. The marigolds are hanging on even as the mums try to overtake them. It’s almost time to hook up the electric blanket – which I will continue to kick off in the middle of the night. But, still, it’s only almost. Not quite there yet, this cool October day."},
{"title": "Wednesday Random Dozen Meme", "date": "Tuesday, October 6, 2009", "text": "If it's Wednesday, it must be time for the Random Dozen Meme from \"Lidna\" at 2nd Cup of Coffee. Sorry it's so long - apparently I had a lot to say this week! P.S. - if you want to participate just go to Linda's site to link up.1. On an average, how often do you splurge and buy something for yourself?Maybe once a quarter? Unless you mean chocolate, which would be pretty much every day.2. Are you more like Hall or Oates? Just kidding. Real question: What is the last creative project you began/finished? Feel free to post a pic of it.I used to be very good about making cards for all of our family members' birthdays. Kept right on top of it. Lately I've been either in a funk or maimed (slight exaggeration). But before my surgery I made a batch of cards - nothing special. Here is one I made for a male relative.3. OK, Goldie Locks, do you consider your house too big, too little or juuuust right?A little bit too small. Dr. M’s office could be bigger (it’s about the size of some people’s walk-in closets). And I’d like a separate room for the washer & dryer – they’re in the kitchen, which will be nice & toasty in cold weather, but was a bit moist this summer. And loud. 4. What is your favorite outdoor chore?Working? Outdoors? Wow – that’s an interesting concept. Just kidding! I actually like to mow, but got to do it exactly once this summer because of my surgery. But next year, I’ll be fighting Dr. M for that mower! There is something so satisfying about watching the grass being neatened, row by row, until at last you’re done. 5. If you knew that cigarette smoking was not bad for your health but would be a weight loss tool, would you use it? Why or why not?I’m not gonna be politically correct here – I think smoking is a disgusting habit. I don’t like the smell, and I don’t like how people get addicted to it (of course, I’m not really even addicted to caffeine, so I’m probably just being smug). So, the answer is a resounding NO. But I’m willing to accept all other suggestions for losing weight (except for that boring one of expending more calories than you consume LOL).  6. On a road trip, would you rather drive or ride?Ride! That way it’s less dangerous when I nod off about 30 minutes into the trip. Yes, I’m just like an infant that way. 7. What do you consider a trivial pursuit?I have so many trivial pursuits of my own that I’m loathe to condemn anyone else’s. I don’t really understand the attraction of reality TV, but I’m sure other people don’t understand my compulsive need to read Bill in Portland Maine’s Cheers & Jeers column on The Daily Kos every day. 8. This weekend, we downloaded the movie \"Duplicity\" with Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Within 5 minutes, I was bored and annoyed, but I kept watching 5-10 minutes at a time hoping it would get better between small chores. I finally gave up and Jorge watched it alone, and then regretted wasting that time because he disliked it intensely, too. So ... how long do you watch a movie or read a book before giving up on it?Ooh – this is tough. I have a REALLY hard time not reading to the end of a book even if I hate it. Dr. M gets frustrated & amused when I start yelling at the book. I think that one time in the last 20 years I skipped to the end because I was so annoyed – but even then I had to read the rest of the stuff in between to find out how the end made sense. These days a lot of my “reading” is audio books – you should see me yelling at the radio in my car LOL.Movies are a little different – although I tend to want to see what happens even if it’s really bad. I’m not as invested in a movie, so I can let it go sometimes – but it has to be early on – in the first 10 minutes or so, or else I’m stuck. 9. Is there a song that you really love but are embarrassed to admit because it's not cool or it's racy or because it's by Hall and Oates?This is going to mark me as a nerd (a quiz on facebook has already confirmed that fact anyway), but as a Southern Baptist I loved to sing hymns – it was my favorite part of church. When I joined the Episcopal Church I was less than impressed with their hymnal (thank goodness our church also used Lift Every Voice and Sing and we had a fabulous music director). But there is this one hymn we sang that just caused me to have such a depth of feeling. I can’t explain it – the tune is very dirge-like. It's called \"I Bind Unto Myself Today\" (also called Saint Patrick's Breastplate). I wanted to find a video of a choir singing it, but all I found was a group of vacation bible school children - & they don't sing my favorite part. You can watch them here, but here are the words (turn off the horrible electronic music while reading - it gets kind of monotonous without any singing!) These are the words I like best:Christ be with me, Christ within me, Christ behind me, Christ before me, Christ beside me, Christ to win me, Christ to comfort and restore me. Christ beneath me, Christ above me, Christ in quiet, Christ in danger, Christ in hearts of all that love me, Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.10. On a scale of 1-10 (10 = extremely) how spontaneous are you?I’d say a 6. I like to think of myself as spontaneous - & I can be when making shopping decisions (I think that’s just because I don’t like to shop & want it to be over as quickly as possible). But, really, I do think twice when someone says, “let’s run off to Cancun on Tuesday.” Well, I would think twice if anyone ever asked me that. 11. Are you a food and/or beverage snob? Nope – I will eat the pizza from the convenience store just as happily as the one from Dewey’s. I do have my favorite soft drink – but since it’s the Kroger store brand I wouldn’t call that being a snob. Here’s a quiz for my readers – what do you call a soft drink like Coke? Growing up, it was just that – as opposed to a hard drink. Here in Ohio they call it “pop” which amuses me no end – that’s what my cousin calls her father. But now I use it like a native.12. Who/What are you trying to control in your life?Boy, this one is TOUGH. Apparently I’m not doing a good job of it because I can’t even think of anything. I’m sure Dr. M could offer some suggestions. Heh. I sure gave up trying to control him a LONG time ago."},

Once again Dr. M & I have proven that we are Opposite Couple. He cooks & does laundry, & until recently was the primary grocery shopper. He’s a lot more \"feeling\" than I am – I’m not logical, exactly, but I often review situations dispassionately. He really is an all-round most excellent husband – and father, apparently, with me being the child. Sometimes he just shakes his head at me as I muddle along as if I’ve never done an adult thing in my life.So last night we were laying in bed (or is it lying? I can never remember), trying to remember which dead white guy was on the fifty dollar bill. We had just watched a documentary on Alexander Hamilton (who is on the $10). Anyway, we were trying to remember who is on the $50, & I said, “Isn’t it Benjamin Harrison because they call them Benjamins?” Dr. M gives me that are-you-sure-you’re-not-really-a-blonde look & says, “No – it’s Benjamin Franklin & he’s on the hundred.” Whoops. He was pretty proud that I remembered that we had a president named Benjamin Harrison. Then we got into a discussion of Andrew Jackson & why he shouldn’t be on the twenty (he was a tyrant & besides, he did not believe in paper money. Oh the irony!). Don’t you love our pillow talk?  P.S. Ulysses S. Grant is on the $50. He’s probably not our finest representation either…"},

She says it’s like the whack-a-mole game & just pops up in new places unexpectedly. She’s underinsured because of her 10 year battle, and can’t afford a biopsy of the latest findings.I was sad because I miss my mother & I can hardly bear to think about her last days.I was sad because Dr. M’s family is struggling with his mother’s condition - and we’re struggling too.I was sad because it feels like the people I pray for don’t ever get better.I was sad because we found out the some of the children who play next door used to live in our house - & someone in the neighborhood complained to the police & they were “run off.” I don’t know what the adults did (or didn’t do) that caused the problem. But I’m sad because the boys lost their home.And lastly, I was sad because Cluckles the Chicken has gone missing.Today, with the bright sunshine after pouring rain and storms, I want to say that I feel better.

Tell me the absolute best way to watch a movie. I like watching them at home in comfy clothes, but if we want me to really pay attention it needs to be in a theater with milk duds & popcorn. 2. Do you ever think about your own funeral? If so, do you have specific ideas about how you would like it to be? I do, sometimes – but I think that it’s the province of the living so I don’t really care. Except that there should be singing.3. Are you more of a giver or a taker? Taker, totally. I have fabulous giving ideas, but my own self-interests do me in most of the time. 4. Vacations: planned activities and schedules, or play it by ear? Play it by ear! It stresses me to have to be somewhere so that’s not very vacationany to me.5. What is one often overlooked item in your home that needs to be cleaned regularly? The floor!6. Name a cause that means a lot to you. Episcopal Relief & Development – this organization is able to help so many more people than I could individually.7. Do you eat a regular old peanut butter jelly sandwich, or do you customize it? And by the way, jelly or no jelly? Definitely yes to jelly – otherwise it’s just P & sticking to the roof of my mouth. Sometimes I add banana, or raisins, or both! And in the dim past my brother & I used to make a mega sandwich with peanut butter, jelly, bologna, cheese & mayo. Not as disgusting as you might imagine – it’s practically a Monte Cristo!8. If we were having a conversation in person, how would I know if you were nervous? My hands would be cold. Wait, my hands are cold now & I’m not nervous. Can somebody turn the heat up in here? I don’t really know what my “tells” are – but I do know that I don’t have a poker face. You’d probably just be able to look in my eyes & see the bundle of nerves right there. 9. Do you have an elaborate bedtime routine, or just the basics of toothbrushing and jammies? When I was younger I was pretty basic, but now there’s a little more to it: set out my clothes for the next day, pack my lunch, brush teeth, floss, wash face, moisturize the heck out of everything from the neck up, make sure there’s a glass of water available for my middle of the night forays, and lastly, pray (if I don’t fall asleep in the middle – I’m so bad!).10. Have you ever regretted something you wrote on your blog? I’ve regretted being ditzy, but then I got over it because I AM ditzy – I would like the blog to reflect who I am…11. Has anyone ever told you that you look like a famous person or celebrity? Did you agree? Back in the day I was told (or maybe I decided myself) that I looked like Valerie Bertinelli. I could sort of see the resemblance, but she has different eyes & is a lot prettier (and I’m not just being self-deprecating!).I looked for a picture of me that might resemble her but couldn't find one. So I decided to post my 6th grade picture.12. If you were going to dedicate a song to a loved one or friend, what would the song be and to whom would it be dedicated? I would dedicate Pomplamoose’s “Beat the Horse” to my dear sweet Dr. M. It’s an inside joke…"},

I used to sleep that late or later on a regular basis on weekends. But since my shoulder injury in January, not so much. I finally have understood what Dr. M means when he says that his body won’t let him sleep in. I’d like to think that this is a sign that my shoulder is healing – and it is – but I still have the same amount of pain, or more, that I had before the surgery. Probably it’s just a sign that lying awake & composing blog posts for two hours on Thursday night caught up with me. (None of the blog posts were interesting upon waking – except for the idea that I’d write about my time in Africa, but that’s so huge that I’m not sure I’m up to the task just now).Anyway, up at 10:00, shower, breakfast, catch up on facebook, and it’s noon before I make my first cleaning foray – the bathroom. Cleaned the tub, toilet & sink, and took the rugs out for a wash. Then I took a computer break. I won’t take you on a cleaning journey, but let’s just say that at this rate it will be next Tuesday before I’m done. Sigh. One of my goals in life is to someday have the money to have someone clean my house. I didn’t enjoy it when I was healthy, & I especially don’t like it now. My mother cleaned houses for a living - & she was really good – but apparently she kept all that love for herself. Meh.What is the point of all this? Just that I’m enjoying my lazy Saturday. Dr. M & I aren’t terribly concerned about dust & carpet cleanliness. We like when the house is clean, but we don’t stress about it. Sometimes what we need is a day to watch college football & baseball & play on the internet & maybe read a book. Let’s not leave the house, ok?

I skipped last week because my answers were boring. I don't know that this week's answers are exciting, but I'm playing anyway...Please share one middle school memory. It can be good, bad, ugly, funny. Pictures or words, I don't care, just share. I had a friend who had a bit of a language issue (remember Janis, Kim?). She was trying to cut back on her cussing so she had me hit her in the arm every time she let loose. I had the best year! What's your favorite Beatles song? Eleanor Rigby. It’s always made me want to be sure that my life means something. I should listen to it every day!If I asked you to describe your most comfortable outfit, what would it be? It’s a matchy matchy outfit of light green cotton capris with a green & white striped top. I look like I’m about to get on a boat. I’m wearing it today with WHITE sandals, because if the weather is going to act like summer (it’s 73F & muggy) then I’m going to wear summer clothes!Would you rather host a party or be a guest? This is tough. I like having guests because Dr. M does all the work. I clean, but he plans & prepares the food. It’s a good partnership. And a big bonus is that I don’t have to go anywhere & can go barefoot if I want. But we don’t do it very often because it wears us out. Going to someone else’s party is less exhausting, but not quite as fulfilling.Do you think we will move completely from traditional books to digital ones, and if we do, are you OK with that? I sure hope not! I did just download a book from my library in PDF format to see what I thought about the concept. I have a little mini notebook & I must admit it was nice to read it on the couch without worrying about turning on a light. And I could check my email periodically. But I like books – how they feel & how portable they are & that they don’t require power (other than a light source). I would like to utilize BOTH forms!Do you learn best by reading, listening or experiencing? Experiencing! It’s best if someone shows me, then I read the instructions to reinforce what they showed me. Listening doesn’t really work very well for me – my mind wanders. I’m amazed that I passed any tests in school!If you are (or when you were) single, what is the kiss of death for you concerning the opposite sex? (That is, what is one trait or behavior or habit or anything at all that immediately turns you off from considering that person a potential match for you?) Back when I was dating the kiss of death was a person who took themselves too seriously. I am fairly irreverent – if a person couldn’t handle that then I didn’t want to hang with them – no fun! Snacks. Salty or sweet? Sweet – I have a bit of a problem with my sweet tooth. I did the 5 Day Miracle Diet about 10 years ago to address just that problem & it worked pretty well. But you can’t stay on a Miracle Diet forever. Sigh.Look around you in a four foot radius. What object is around you that you didn't realize was there or forgot was there? How long has it been there? I’m at work, but I have a food scale on my desk – in case I wanted to measure how many ounces of chocolate covered raisins I was eating (really!). I brought it in about 9 months ago, but obviously I haven’t felt the need to measure any food lately!What is your favorite Tom Cruise movie? Jerry Maguire (mostly because of Renee Zellweger & the little kid).You buy a bottle of shampoo and discover that you don't like what it does to your hair at all. What do you do with that full bottle? Bring it to work & make one of the ladies here take it.Your favorite Fall comfort food? (Last week it was beverage.) Pecan Pie – I know I can get it other times of the year, but it seems to show up more in the fall. mmm - sticky goodness!"},

It was a minor scandal, although lots of people told me about how a man with a happy marriage usually remarries quickly. Mostly I was just glad that someone was making him happy since I couldn’t be there myself.It was a bit rough at first. They were like teenagers – and, seriously, who needs to see your parent immersed in puppy love? No one, that’s who! Now they’ve calmed down a bit – although they’re still a little on the too sweet side for me.Today is Amy’s birthday, & I decided it was time to introduce you to her. She makes my Dad laugh. A lot. She rode a motorcycle up until the last few years. She went to school for her Master’s degree after her children were grown & taught at the school for the deaf – the special needs kids! She is NOT a woman to be messed with! She has a smart mouth. She teaches Sunday School.But, mostly when I think about Amy I hear music. She & Daddy met in a singing group – the Joymakers. And they make beautiful music together. When they’re not doing slapstick. Or making doe-eyes (ick!).Happy Birthday Amy!"},

It could still happen, but it’s looking less & less likely. And my adopted team, the Reds, won’t be there either. That’s not all that unexpected – although they’re playing pretty good baseball right now.As usual, at this time of year, when none of “my” teams is in the playoffs I’m filled with sadness & relief. Bittersweet I guess. I’m sad because we won’t get to watch these teams play ever again. Sure Chipper will probably still be with the Braves next year & Bronson will most likely still pitch for the Reds, but these particular teams won’t play again. There’ll be trades, and players designated for assignment, and whippersnappers up from the minor leagues. And for heaven’s sake hopefully some good pitching will be acquired! It’ll be fun & exciting, and at first every team will be headed to the playoffs.But I’m relieved to have the “will they win or won’t they” tension gone from my shoulders. I’ll get to pull for teams indiscriminately – probably based on who the current underdog is (this is also my strategy in the NCAA basketball tournament). I will boo the Yankees and Cardinals, but pull for almost anyone else. And it’s exciting because who knows what will happen? Probably the Yankees or Cardinals will win the World Series – but you never know! And it’s a bit liberating to not have to watch “my” team play, breath bated, all that awful agony.I know, I’m weird. And Dr. M is going to have some choice words to say about all this once I hit Post. He never thinks it’s a good thing when our team doesn’t make it to the playoffs. And don’t we all know that part of my relief is watching his disappointment now & not his sadness later (which may or may not be accompanied by  choice words and flinging of inanimate objects – a Wake Forest basketball game years ago resulted in a duct taped TV remote).It’s hard to watch the ones we love suffer & not be able to fix it.

{"title": "Socks", "date": "Thursday, September 17, 2009", "text": "So many of my blog friends have introspective, thoughtful posts today. Exploring their inner & outer worlds in new ways. Challenging us to follow them into the depths. (Well, maybe not Big Mama). But I’m here today to talk about socks. And the trauma of growing up with my father.During my morning routine these days I always eat two peanut butter crackers (the ones with orange crackers – nabs, if you will) so that my stomach isn’t empty when I take my 27 ibuprofen. Well, really it’s just 4, but it feels like that many! Yes, it might make sense to just go ahead & eat breakfast. Ha! Those of you who think that don’t know me very well – I’ve got my routine precisely timed & there is no breakfast allotted. I eat breakfast at my desk at work. I’ve tried to be a morning person, but at this late date it’s not going to happen.I take the ibuprofen as soon as I can upon waking not because of my shoulder (although it helps) or because of the arthritis in my hip, but because of my cracked tailbone. Makes the 45 minute morning commute SO much more comfortable.Anyway (I am getting to the point!), this morning I did my little routine. Eat one cracker while dressing, take two ibuprofen. Eat a second cracker, take another ibuprofen. Then I put a sock on, paused (for perhaps as long as an entire minute!) & took the last ibuprofen. Yes, that was one sock. The other foot was just dangling out there all cold, waiting for its own sock. I can hardly bear the asymmetry. One warm foot, one cold foot. At the time I was proud that I wasn’t whimpering. I’m shuddering just remembering it now. Yikes!And this is where my father comes in. He with his two socks on each foot, taunting me while he talked about how HOT his feet were as he took the socks off slowly. And then just STOPPING while there was still a sock on one of his feet. DADDY TAKE YOUR SOCK OFF!!! I was traumatized. He did this to me a lot while I was growing up. And maybe last Christmas. You just can’t escape some childhood terrors. We won’t even talk about the tickle monster. (Yes Daddy, I'm holding my arms TIGHT at my sides even now thinking about that).And now, I’m going to spend some time studiously ignoring the fact that one arm is encased in a cloth sling while the other arm is free as a bird in short sleeves. How many of you have the same pathological (not the technical use of the word) need for the temperature of all your body parts to match?  This post was inspired by Linda at 2nd Cup of Coffee. You can read about her horrible asymmetrical foot experience here. Happy Birthday Daddy!"},

{"title": "Kitchen Sink", "date": "Wednesday, September 9, 2009", "text": "I'm continuing to drag out things I've already written (I promise that I won't start posting all 16 of our annual Christmas poems - at least until Christmas!). I'm not sure what prompted me to write down these thoughts - although I totally remember that time in my life & why I was thinking these things. We'd been married a little over a year at that point & we were moving to Asheville for Dr. M to go to school (unbeknownst to either of us we were starting on the journey that led us here to Ohio). I've added some paragraph breaks because it's easier to read that way, but the original version was just one long free-flowing thought process. Here we go!I am standing at the kitchen sink talking to God. It is like writing a letter to my fourth grade best friend: I have moved so far away from her that I don’t know what language to use. “God,” I say, “we need to get reacquainted.” And then I pause, mesmerized by the soap bubbles that seem so much more real than God. You see, I am a present moment person. That’s what everyone says, and I have to reason to doubt them. My husband, the historian, tells my parents, on a tour of Raleigh, “This is where the civil war earthworks are.” I, on the other hand, point to an intersection, “This is where the spark plug fell out of my car!” Sure, earthworks are interesting, but spark plugs are real. And that is my problem with God who, at the moment, is an earthwork and not a spark plug. How do you talk to a relic? And why? The problem is this: I need to decide what to do with my life. At least, that’s what everyone tells me, and I have no reason to doubt them. I, present moment person that I am, have been content to drift dandelion-along, taking life as it comes. My college degree pointed me in a certain direction, but I have largely ignored it. We’re moving. I’ve always wanted to live in Asheville. But now THE DAY OF RECKONING IS AT HAND. I am supposed to use this move as a career stepping stone. Career! Goodness! I have never wanted a career – I want to have fun! I understand that the right career can be fun, and so I feel honor-bound to search for my niche, but it feels very unreal to me. This is where God comes in. I used to assume that I was, indeed, being led by God. That sure took a load off of my shoulders! God just opened the door and I went through. And then I went to seminary, where I learned that not only is God not who I thought she was, she/he was not going to nudge me along the path of righteousness. I have options! And not only that, any option may turn out to be the right one! I’m no Calvinist. I left seminary believing that God’s will is not a road, it is an attitude. I am free to be God’s child wherever I am. And so. I am talking to a stranger at the kitchen sink. “God, we need to have a talk. I can’t see you very clearly now, and my path is full of possibility. I’m scared! How do I know what door to open? I am full of contradictions. I want to write. I want to work with computers. My skills are in other areas. I feel reluctant to think in terms of ‘career’. Are you there?” Dirty dishwater. Clean dishes. I look outside my window. Our yard is dotted with dandelions. White frizz floats on the breeze and I think that I will burst with freedom and responsibility. I am my own person. I choose to think “avocation” and unchain myself from career nightmares. My historian and I will survive, though I don’t find my niche. After all, I am a dandelion – small and useless in a box, filled with power on the wind.March 23, 1992Our wedding day, December 15, 1990. We were pretending to ring the church bell. I sort of had this southern belle thing going on. As you can tell from my expression, it was a good day.I’ve tried to be good & only mention my recuperating shoulder in passing, but before I post another gem from my past (not a poem this time – an essay) I decided to slip this in here. I started my physical therapy last week. I’ve had three sessions now. Last week I learned from my therapist that what I had is a SLAP tear (an injury to the Glenoid labrum, whatever that is). Apparently this type of injury has to be corrected with (arthroscopic) surgery most of the time. So I guess this was all necessary – which is good since I already had the surgery!I’m not supposed to lift my arm over my head for the first six weeks (so the little biodegradable pin they put in doesn’t come loose – eww!). Four down, two to go. And you know, not looking forward to physicial therapy after that sixth week. Ouch! Last night I had a substitute therapist & I thought she would kill me. Really! She looked nice & we had a lovely conversation about books on tape, and all the while I was thinking can’t she tell I’m dying here? I’ve been told by many kind & thoughtful friends that it’s only going to get worse. I’ve never been a “no pain no gain” kind of gal, but I have a goal here & I plan to slog through until I reach it. I’ve already mentioned this goal to you guys and to my boss’s wife. I told my therapist that was my goal & he was not the least bit surprised or dismayed. He said that he’d had another client with the same goal. Apparently she had multinational underarms (American on one side & European on the other).So, although I’ll continue to keep the whining at a minimum, I will probably be posting on my progress to my goal. Maybe I should have one of those counters on my blog – maybe a butterfly on a ruler that moves closer to the goal each week…"},

I guess the collision of all that actual documented church history and theology slamming up against what we learned in church growing up created a dissonance that needed impartial guidance - or maybe more dysfunctional folks were attracted to the idea of seminary (I was in both categories, actually). So, anyway, as part of therapy I wrote a poem in March 1990 describing where I would be in six months.

I like the cooler air & beautiful trees, but despite my present-moment personality, as soon as I see the signs, I leap ahead & dread winter with its dark commutes to and from work, and its ice and snow. Ever since I developed arthritis in my left hip I’ve had a deep fear of falling on ice. And this year my broken tail-bone & my shoulder aren’t going to make that fear any better. Sigh. Um, Bug? It’s still technically summer. And there probably won’t be any snow & ice for another 100 days or so. Chill.So, in an effort to be more upbeat, and to keep up with the fall crowd (my blog list is filled with people who love fall), I’m going to try to view it differently this year.Today was a definite step forward. Dr. M & I decided to go to the first home football game at his new school. We had a blast! The game was close, & we emerged victorious on a literal last second field goal by one of Dr. M’s Women’s History class students (a guy, by the way, in case you wondered - & really quite a cutie, says the woman old enough to be his mother). Wow! Now I’m all psyched to go to the other home games. I’m thinking I need a royal blue stadium seat & a more expanded wardrobe (I just have one t-shirt currently). Well, the accessories are half the fun, aren’t they? (Just re-read this paragraph – the kicker is cute, but not the reason I want to go to all the games. That would just be icky.)I’m including a few pics to commemorate the day. As you can see, Dr. M & I are quite the nerds. We’re old enough to totally not care.

And if you’re looking for romance, I’ll be nice to you…Hey mister it’s so cold if you don’t have someone to hold. I’ll do anything I’m told to do…”A really great salad must have this ingredient: almondsAdvice in a nutshell to new bloggers (one or two sentences): I’m still new myself, but I’ll say that if you want to experience the blogging community you should comment on other blogs you like – they might visit you & then you can get a dialog going.What was the alternate name that your parents almost named you? Do you wish they had chosen it instead of the one they gave you? I don’t think there was one (was there, Daddy?). When I was a kid I didn’t like that boys and girls could have my name (Dana). Today I don’t care.What in your life are you waiting for? To get out of debt.You get a package in the mail. What is it, and who is it from? The new boots I ordered today (hence the getting out of debt problem). But I need new shoes for the more extreme winters we’re going to have now!Today--what song represents you? White-Wheeled Limousine by Bruce Hornsby (I’ve been in a mystery frame of mind lately).What is one thing that blogging has taught you about yourself? I’m a little more vain & a little less daring than I thought I was.How are you going to (or how did you) choose the clothes you're wearing today? What do they say about you in general or specifically how you're feeling today? I’m in normal office attire today – except that I’m wearing this particular pair of black pants because they have an elastic waist-band so I don’t have to deal with zippers & buttons with one hand. So I’d say my clothes say I’m practical!"},

We really enjoy how he spends his time after his diagnosis. All these little vignettes of life moments.Really, though, I only bring it up to state the obvious. I believe that I have a brain cloud. It’s hovering somewhere just above my neck. Sometimes the sun breaks through, but mostly I’m seeing the world through a fog. No, I’m not abusing my pain meds thank you very much!

Dr. M & I like those sounds of childhood.Anyway, one or the other of the boys is always coming over to ask if we’ve seen their hen.

Hummingbird B (Ruth) thought that looked pretty yummy & decided to join Madge. And it was on! Madge chased Ruth off & came back. Then Ruth decided she was no pushover & went for the basket again. I can just imagine the conversation as Madge chased Ruth around the yard – “why you upstart whippersnapper!” I have no evidence that Madge is older than Ruth, other than my not very agile imagination. That and the fact that at this stage of my life I like to think age trumps youth. Heh. I have never seen so much hummingbird activity at one time! Drinking, diving, swooping, even (gasp!) sitting for all of 5 seconds on a fence post. Unfortunately my gimpy arm & I were no match for all the swoopiness & I couldn’t get a picture.

At least that fear is gone – the doctor’s comment to Dr. M: “no wonder she was in pain!” Apparently there was some bone on bone activity. Ouch! Of course, that’s a mixed blessing because now I have to go back to worrying about fear #1.

My worry about money. My fear that my boss will be helpless without me. Let’s just take this sticky ball of crazy-think & drop it in the Mad River. There it goes – floating downstream… If you’d like to think of this as a euphemism for God, go right ahead! Thinking about that was pretty interesting, but I think that seeing all the gorgeous flowers, and spending time in the Cedar Bog (which is not really a bog – it’s a fen! Dr. M. asked if that made my blog a blen) filled the empty place left by the sticky ball with a somnambulant peace. I think things will be just fine. And when I wake up on the other side I’ll do what comes next. I’m not a drama queen, am I?P.S. We passed by a sign that said “concealed carry course, $100.” I asked Dr. M why someone would carry a gun on a golf course. Ba dum bum.

The second sample is from a journal I found from the summer of 1980 – just after my sophomore year in high school. Unfortunately I only wrote a handful of entries (many of them about how annoyed I was at my cousin Kim – sorry Kim – don’t worry, we made up!). I was very interested in what I found worth writing at that time. I LOVED an entry about how I’d entered the world of drugs because a classmate had taken four painkillers. I couldn’t scan it because I named names, but here is another small snippet that tickled me. I find my handwriting to be very uninteresting. Not really good, not really bad (ooh you should see Dr. M’s!). Kind of loopy, like me. I was a little more “upright” 29 years ago, but I still don’t have that much of a slant.

Basically a thought or poem or essay blooms in my head, fully formed & resists all efforts to modify or rewrite – draft isn’t really in my vocabulary. Except for this little post, obviously – there’s no blooming going on here! Just being contemplative while I listen to the rain.How do you write?

No, I’m not trying to distract you – we totally saw you roll your eyes when we talked about not having to get the iron out for another 6 months.  I sure wish you were going to be here for this move! All that energy buzzing around - you always made me feel really tired. Yes, I know I should just get up & Move It! I like to think about things first. Oh, you think I'm just procrastinating. This sure sounds like a familiar fight - let's change the subject!So, are you taking credit for Dr. M’s success? I know you think you created him – proud, are you? Yes, we’re still happy together after all these years – the 20th anniversary of our first kiss is coming up! No, I am NOT planning on having kids – I’m too old now. Face it – the bet is over. Course, you won it anyway, since you knew my heart…Well, I’d better get off here now & get ready for church. Need to check the lottery number first – wouldn’t it be ironic if we won now that Dr. M has a job? Sure you can’t fix that for us? Bummer…Love you Mom. Happy Mother’s Day."},
{"title": "Home", "date": "Friday, May 8, 2009", "text": "I grew up in the gentle rolling hills of the North Carolina piedmont, where we were slightly concerned that the kudzu would take over the landscape (are you sure this road will still be here the next time we come by?). This land was all that I had ever known & it just WAS – I didn’t have to think about it being different from the mountains or from the beach. It was just home.I went to college, and then later lived for five years in the western North Carolina mountains – cradled in the bosom of mother earth. A cliché, but it felt oh so true. I was safe, surrounded by my mountain home. And of course, it was very beautiful to me.So why is it, when we explore our potential new home in Ohio, near where Dr. M will be teaching, that I feel this tug at my inner core? This is familiar country. This flat land with the big sky. The gentle dips and rises of land near the river. The farms and the long straight roads. Shouldn’t this feel alien to me? Perhaps one day I will wake up & wonder where in the world I am. But for now, I want to plant a tomato vine and call it home.P.S. I've added a link about kudzu for the uninformed - but you can view it here as well."},
{"title": "Remains to be seen...", "date": "Wednesday, May 6, 2009", "text": "Last Wednesday we received a call that Dr. M’s 73 year old mother had been in a serious car accident & was air-lifted to a regional hospital in Charlotte, NC (near where she lives). We hurriedly made plans to go out of town for an undetermined period of time – Dr. M made arrangements for his last week of classes & for others to give his exams, while I ran back to the office to put things in order there. We spent the rest of the week & weekend in NC, returning yesterday late.When we arrived in Charlotte my MIL was moving around, but not awake & not responsive to commands. We were really afraid of how much brain damage there might have been. On Sunday when we went to visit she was awake & recognized us - & claimed that the car accident was the other person’s fault! We thought that was a good sign. We still don’t know physically how well she’ll recover, but it seems as though her mind is there. We’re thrilled & terrified – she’s pretty willful – will we be able to convince her to follow doctor’s orders? Remains to be seen!"},

{"title": "Wherein I finally PASS my MRI", "date": "Wednesday, April 29, 2009", "text": "So today was take two of my MRI saga. What, didn't I tell you about take one? It was on Friday. I obviously had no clue was I was getting myself into. I arrived with warm clothes (I was told it would be cold). It was in the upper 70s in the room. I had not had any pain meds for my arm since 8:30 that morning (I know, I know, common sense Bug! There's this absence of that commodity in my life). I asked for headphones to listen to music & chose Classic Rock. When she turned the music on I immediately heard \"the lunatic is in my head.\" Not sure Pink Floyd was the best choice for relaxation. She pushed me into the tube & suddenly I couldn't breathe. My chest was heaving. I was sweltering. The giant headphones were smothering me. I thought I would have to press the panic button right away. But I had a good talk with myself & started breathing easier, calmed down, counted to 500. I was going to make it! Then my arm started to hurt. Then a little more. Then it was excruciating & the muscle started to jump. So we had to stop the proceedings about halfway through. I was fairly well disgusted.Today was a whole other animal. I took some Aleve at 2:00. They gave me happy pills to relax me (they actually made me a bit drunk & incoherent - thank goodness Dr. M drove me there!), and even though they sort of wore off before we got started I was just fine. I opted for ear plugs instead of music and it was freezing in there this time so no feeling of being smothered - in fact she had to stop it this time to put a blanket over me so I'd stop shaking. And I made it! Yay! Hopefully the pictures will reveal a mildly torn rotator cuff that can be fixed with physical therapy.I was too anxious about this to fully enjoy the news of Dr. M's job. Now I'm full steam ahead. Bring on the rental properties!"},

{"title": "Chrissy Snow", "date": "Thursday, April 23, 2009", "text": "I recently took a Facebook quiz which promised to tell me which Three’s Company character I am. I’m not sure what I expected – maybe one of the Ropers – but I didn’t expect the actual result: Chrissy. Really? Well, sure, Dr. M always comments that he thinks I’m a blond who dyes her hair brown. And, yes, I do have a reputation as a bit of a dingbat. But I’m not actually that vacuous, am I? (No comments from the peanut gallery!). I think I’m just easily distracted. And gullible. And not in possession of much common sense. So it probably just gives the impression of vacuity. Really.Here’s an example. The other night I was cooking green beans. I had sautéed pecans in some olive oil to toast them. And the pan started smoking just a bit (pecans cook fast!) so I turned on the overhead fan. I sautéed some garlic, then added the beans & some chicken broth & simmered a while – I’m from the South – we do not do crisp green beans!. When I finished cooking I went to turn the fan off. I turned one of the knobs over the stove & it went dark in the kitchen. Since I had meant to turn off the fan (& not the light) my brain couldn't quite process it correctly & I thought, \"Well now it's too dark to see how to turn off the light!\" See – I was just distracted by the darkness. I’m not really a ditz."},
{"title": "Interview", "date": "Friday, April 17, 2009", "text": "Jo over at A Majority of Two has given us some interview questions. Since we haven't heard anything about Dr. M's job (sigh) I decided to go ahead & answer them.Have you ever been influenced by a work of art – music, painting, book – and if so, how? My first thought was Mister God, This is Anna – but it’s been so long since I read it that I don’t remember why it affected me so (I’ve got it on hold at the library – we’ll see what I think after I read it again). Then I thought about The Bell Jar. At the end of that book I was terrified – she did such a good job of taking you down that path to suicide. It seemed logical, something to be desired. An “of course” moment. Boy was that scary! I vowed that I would NEVER believe that suicide was the logical answer to any circumstance. So I guess that was pretty life-changing. If you were a chocolate bar, what type would you be? Oh totally the one with nuts. I think a Cadbury Fruit & Nut bar sums me up nicely!What is your secret weapon to lure the opposite sex? There hasn’t been any luring in many a year, let me tell you! But back in the day, I think my tendency to NOT treat the opposite sex like gods, to laugh a lot, & to make them want to figure me out lured them in. Then they figured out there wasn’t that much there – I just think everything is funny!What, in your opinion, is your greatest accomplishment? I have two: 1. I recognized the other part of my soul when I met Dr. M (just took me a few months to figure it out – “oh that’s the warm & fuzzy feeling I have when we’re together – I thought it was just the ping pong.”) And, 2. the fact that Dr. M & I have kept up our Christmas poem tradition for 16 years now.How many friends do you have on your Facebook account? 64. I just added a friend of one of my brother’s friends the other day – woo hoo!"},

I worked in the Baptist mission as a secretary/bookkeeper.I have an accounting degree. I have never worked as an accountant.I’m married to a historian.I never really liked history in school.I have arthritis in my left hip (really – there’s an x-ray to prove it!)I’ve been married for 18 years.I have practically every book Nora Roberts has ever written.Even after 4 years I still miss my Mom practically every day.My husband is my best friend (in all the world!).Unlike Argent I have no witty commentary to accompany this list. My brain is a chocolate crème Cadbury egg – little bit gooey right this moment!P.S. Dr. M. has his second interview tomorrow! We are nervous wrecks! His classroom presentation is about prohibition. Did you know that not drinking was considered your patriotic duty during World War I?"},
{"title": "Father Knows Best", "date": "Wednesday, April 8, 2009", "text": "Don’t you hate it when that happens? You’re in your 40’s & think you know what’s what & then you ignore advice from your Dad & learn the hard way – again.This is the story of my Baby Arm & how I turned it into The Arm That Wouldn’t Move. It’s not really much of a story. I was helping someone out at church by carrying her baby. The baby was in a carrier (one of those car seat things you can tote kids around in). I’m pretty much a wimp and at the time I thought, “boy is this REALLY hard! I’ll bet she weighs 10 pounds!” Actually, I think she weighed more than a stapler, but just slightly less than a copy paper box - maybe 9 reams instead of 10 (I work in an office – we find our comparisons where we can). Her mom (a tiny little thing) had no trouble at all with this task, so I’m not sure why I felt compelled to help. ANYWAY, I carried the little girl to my car from her apartment, & then into church when got there. I let her mom get her back to the car after church, because by then I knew that I had no business lugging that child around – it wasn’t safe for either of us!Couple of days later I started to feel really sore in that arm. I just powered through figuring the pain would pass. And then it didn’t. My Dad said I should start doing some gentle stretches with it. But it hurt, so I started favoring the arm instead. I moved both of my mice to the other side of the keyboard. I bought a sling to remind me to stop using the arm. Guess what happened? My unused shoulder muscles started freezing up so that I couldn’t lift the arm at all! And now I’m in physical therapy to unfreeze the sucker. Once we do that we’ll see whether there’s any actual damage in there.So the moral of the story is to listen to your Dad. And maybe to let the mom who actually has upper body strength carry the baby."},

Those of you who know me will be amazed by this news, I’m sure, but it’s really true. This morning I went to Weight Watchers & I’m down 1.8 pounds. This would ordinarily be a cause for celebration, but I didn’t have a particularly good WW week. I spent some time with Cadbury eggs & Ben & Jerry’s (& the week before that there was a tryst with some cookie dough). So after I saw my nice loss I started thinking (scary, I know).What type of wasting disease do I have? What kind of disease doesn’t have any symptoms, yet causes me to lose weight? I head to the keyboard, ready to type in www.webmd.com. Then I remember a maxim that I created (& quote often): If I’m on plan 80% of the time that’s way better than not being on plan at all. It’s true – my body is so thrilled to be fed healthy food 80% of the time that it’s pretty forgiving of all the saturated fat it gets the other 20%.So, I lost 1.8 pounds this week. Hallelujah & pass the hash browns!"},

Dr. M says \"squish 'em!\" That way the scouts won't report back about this vast white playground called our tub, and the rest of the colony will think they died of smallpox & won't invade us. Wait, that didn't really work in history, did it? We came on over here anyway...Dr. M's second interview has been moved to the 14th - they don't have class on the 9th (oops!). He says they need an admin to keep them straight. I think I'm the person for the job! Now I just have to convince them that there is a job. And that they need to pay me mucho bucks. Ha!I am actually going for a walk this afternoon! It wasn't my idea, I was asked, but surely even moving my body reluctantly helps my heart... And really, it's GORGEOUS here today - there won't be any reluctance once I step outside the door. Off I go - into the wild blue parking lot! Not a ton of nature to be had at my office...Update: Apparently I misheard Dr. M, & my grasp of history is so poor that I thought I was making sense. Sorry!

Could be arm pain, although I had a cortisone shot today which helped a lot (I'll tell the story of how I injured myself another time when I'm feeling witty again - it's a typical Bug maneuver).I think I feel weighed down by the needs of all the folks I've been praying for lately. There's Barry. And Heather. And, breaking my heart on a daily basis, Stellan. And the Hispanic family in our parish being torn apart by ICE - they're here to get medical care for their Down's Syndrome daughter and now her father is being deported.I know that God is there. Although my mother died despite my fervant prayers, I know that God is there. And there is comfort in being in that presence. But it still weighs me down.So I'll pray for my list of folks tonight, and then I'll lay me down to rest... Which will guarantee a better night's sleep than that Dean Koontz book I read last night!P.S. Dr. M has a followup interview next Thursday (the 9th)! We are pretty dern excited around here."},
{"title": "Let's just add insult to injury, shall we?", "date": "Saturday, March 28, 2009", "text": "So I go to the doctor for my sore arm, he refers me to an orthopedic specialist because he thinks it might be a rotator cuff injury (oh joy – shouldn’t that happen to someone who actually rotates her cuff occasionally?), and then, then, he gives me a tetanus shot in the sore arm! What? I go to the doctor for comfort & leave with no new drugs, a referral and MORE pain in my arm?I’m telling you, there’s no justice in the world. To salve my wounds I decided to go to Victoria’s Secret to torture my arm further by trying on bras. I got fitted by some skinny chick (really cute & nice though) who said that I’m a 36D! D? I used to go without wearing a bra back in the day & now I’m a D? I’m not fooled though – the ginormous bras I got at Pennys are 38B, so obviously Vic is just crazy these days. In any case I spent a ridiculous amount of money for two bras that actually fit, so that’s something. We just won’t tell anyone what size they are – our little secret, ok?P.S.

This is not for the doctor – it’s for the ladies at Victoria’s Secret. Because I’ve decided that nothing heals a pulled muscle faster than a new bra. Really!And I really really really hope the doctor doesn’t tell me to just quit using that arm for a while because I’m NOT competent with my left hand. I’m enough of a klutz with my right hand. There would be mayhem. Maybe mayhem would be good for me – that would certainly tie in with the suffering thing!P.S. Dr. M.

Not sure what I'm going to do with this space - but I'll try to visit pretty often. We'll see.I'm in the midst of Lent right now. As a Southern Baptist, I was not really familiar with the concept. But now I'm an Episcopalian and it’s a fascinating part of the church calendar. I love how the sanctuary (nave?) and service are down to bare essentials. And every year my goal is to also be down to bare essentials (not Bare Escentuals – although I love their makeup!). And every year I don’t really succeed. Last night at Bible study I realized – perhaps – why that’s the case. I’m just not really into suffering all that much. Even the “suffering” involved in not eating chocolate, or getting up an hour early to do the Daily Office, much less the suffering of actually being present with people in pain or trying to do something constructive to ease the pain. What would it look like if I were to approach Lent as a way to be more Christ-like – in his suffering as well as in his ministry of love to other people? Giving up chocolate doesn’t really seem to fit the bill, does it?"}
