She asked if she could have one and I said sure, expressing surprise that she smoked weed.\"I don't\", she said, \"but my son works for one of those dispensaries, and he might be interested in this product\". I said I don't think I want to manufacture these in bulk but let me dial in the protoypes and get the construction more streamlined and we will talk. I figure a licensing aggreement in which case, I know I would get around 5% of any proceeds. Definitely not interested in spending my days in mass production hell, but I also am interested in some extra dough. I modified how I produced the plaster molds. Making 3D prints for the two-part plaster mold halves (software modification easier than contructing a new pipe to mold), but I often had to destroy the 3D print while demolding from the plaster.So instead I made a 3D print of the mold part, and then poured silicone rubber in to create the working mold halves.I made a two part plaster with the rubber mold parts today and it worked slick as snot. This was such a painless process that I am now interested in applying this reusable mold teachnique for other projects, possibly even complex multipart plaster molds, which is a step back into the past, tech-wise. No matter. So, I will have distracted myself on to other things, per usual."},
{"title": "Oh, NOW you want nuclear fusion power?", "date": "Saturday, January 20, 2024", "text": "At DAVOS, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman declares new sources of power to meet the energy demand of AI, particularly nuclear fusion. Like the cryptocurrency clusterfuck, AI is consuming vast amounts of power, and Sam Altman finally says maybe we should get commercial fusion power going.Hey, I'm all for it, but rather than create the bloated turd that is ITER, with a corrupt and sclerotic bureaucracy, and piece meal efforts of various institutions, we could have provided a concentrated, multi-hundred billion dollar effort to get there. Had we wished to, we probably could have had fusion power by the year 2000. We did not wish to. Money wasn't a problem, as we managed to throw tens of trillions at stupid  wars. Just a fraction of that money gets you nuclear fusion.Part of the reason is a rather wise choice not to pursue such superdense energy systems due to lack of knowledge and technology. That's fair. If the tech and knowledge was in place (now they are), do you really want chain saws and off road vehicles run on Mr. Fusion? Why the planet would be a wreck in no time. For that matter, what if it is easier to build a fusion rocket than a reactor. A fusion rocket gets you to Mars, but it can also be a devastating weapon on terrestrial targets.The spending of $100 billion to date on self-driving cars (replacing cheap human drivers with shoddy expensive robots) probably could have gotten us a aneutronic fusion power source. My vote is for hydrogen boron fusion  being pursued by HB11 and Helion Energy. Billionaires are now finally throwing their money at it, and devoting AI architecture to the now familar problems. But for what? Don't we have enough scams already? More than half the stuff on the internet is AI generated garbage. It's clogging Google search, which I can personally attest is getting worse. Not to mention this AI adventure is still a Mechanical Turk, with humans tasked to sift out the horrible and hallucinating content to be fed to the robots. Not to mention glean out the AI generated garbage to be scrapced as data. The only people I see making money on this is the billionaires who already have a monopoly on, well, everything. Looks pretty grim."},

One day Donny mouths off, and the kid sics the hound on him. Maybe more than once. It explains why Trump hates dogs, and his worst insult is dog. But then again, Trump's parents did a good job on fucked in head, so maybe more than dogs. Now, I've seen when Trump had the posture of a whipped dog. The first time was around Jeffrey Epstein, Trump a little dog bouncing around big dog Jeff. The second at the inauguration, after a chat with Obama. The third time at Helsinki, after the meeting with Putin. Whipped dog slinking that one, wow!My take on the 2018 Helsinki meeting is that Putin brought his dog, a big snarly snapper.\"Don't worry he won't bite!\" Putin assures him. The dog barking and growling and lunging against the leash Putin holds lightly in his hand. This goes on for a while, and then Putin takes the dog away, and wheels in a tank with his pet shark, a big snarly snapper.\"Don't worry, he won't bite!\" In Putin's Russia, bite sharks you!50% of Americans believe in demons. 45% believe in ghosts. That gets you our current representative republic. If this is 21st century America, think of what the Founding Fathers had to work with.On more than one occasion, I have said \"a lottery could have picked someone better!\" But that can't be done at the federal level without changing the Constitution. So you set up a thrid party, maybe call it Other, or None of the Above (NotA finger!). Just like a lottery, you register with a donation, you got a ticket at becoming congressperson, senator, President. If our party wins the slot, someone is randomly selected from the roles.I've written about this before, I should go find out if I'm repeating myself like a doddering old man. But what the hye. Questions:Q) what if some idiot gets chosen, A) recall elections are still there, and what if they are not an idiot, but better than the drama queens and daddy's little vampire squids we got now? I'm not being cynical. There are people honestly dedicated to public service that could be doing better things than dealing with all the bullshit. However, there is a parasitoid version of ape that seeks the wells of power and glamor, and Washington DC is that niche.Q) what's to stop some rich guy from buying all the tickets to win? A) that's easy, we set up donations as uniform regardless of buy ins, like a knock-out, your subsequent donation is still your only donation, but you enrich the pot.  Bigger pot means bigger media presence. (Note to self: don't use dicks as the face of  NotA).Q: If it holds up in court (why wouldn't it?), and you are randomly selected, what should you do? A) Interesting as it is made obvious that the staff has all the insight and institutional knowledge of what some people call the deep state. There is going to be a tremendous tidal wave of influence and monies, about to be showered upon you by the powers that be, as it should be, but- you would be smart to get all your cronies together, (competent) family and (honest) friends for staff and support, and then deal with the Beast.Q) can it fly? A) like all thrid parties to date? Nope"},
{"title": "A City On Mars", "date": "Friday, January 12, 2024", "text": "I flirted with space opera writing a couple of short stories on this blog. I won't link to them as they are all bad. I made them all Mary Sue (were I am in the story and of course, the hero). The only time you use that device is when you would rather be in a story than in real life.My stories were safe and bland, havens of normality rather than tense and difficult life I was living.As bad as the stories were, I still took pleasure in the world building, or rather the constraints. Example from ten years ago:Short version, humanity has sparsely populated the universe via wormhole conduits, meaning no spaceships, no spaceports, no spacefaring infrastructure, and doing it all with what amounts to late 1970s technology (nothing to sneeze at, pretty ingenious). So, these wormholes are fickle things, and for the longest time passage through one amounted to a one-way trip with no return. It was only, say, twenty years after the first foray that humans learned the trick of return trips to Earth. As a result, there's a lot of lost colonies out there in the cosmos, some of which would never be heard from again. And there's the problem involving colonization.So, let's say you've got this big hole. It's just a big hole. If you want, it's a hole in the sky. On the other side of this big hole is whole new world, lush and green and filled with fresh air, sunshine and animals and clean water and absolutely no people. The hole is going to stay open for a short time, and while it's open, you can go back and forth. But eventually the hole will close and will never reappear again. You know this. You know if go through and stay, you will be stuck in this new world for good.What do you take with? Oh, one other restriction is you are confined to, say nothing more advanced than 1979 technology.Well, here's my thinking. You walk into this new world, you'll want to have an idea of what your base technology will be. In other words, you don't come over expecting to use internal combustion engines, since you don't where the oil is, you don't know when you'll have refineries built, you don't have any of the chemical and electrical infrastructure. Similarly, you probably don't bring coal-fire locomotives over. So, in my view, you start out with a base technology of around, say, 1820 or so. You've got high pressure steam engines that burn wood. You've got a lot of spare parts for that. Oh sure, you bring as many modern amenities and appliances and generators and fuel and airplanes and satellite launching rockets and computers as you can shove through the hole, and use as it long as it all lasts. You may have mini-factories stashed in 40 foot shipping containers. You've got a shitload of books. And skilled people. And food. And seeds. And... what else? In other words, this becomes a prepper problem. The world falls apart. How to rebuild it?Because, you figure, no matter how much shit you shove through the hole, you just can't support a modern world. You can't support a modern world, not without billions of people. Your best 1979 candidates for interstellar colonization are hunter gatherers, subsistence farmers, herders, citizens of what they called back then The Third World. Theproblem with these awkward stories was, enthusiastic as I was, I could not suspend my disbelief.What is current fantasy? Well, according to this book, A City On Mars, the entire manned space program and space colonization.Consider my scenario above. The most preposterous element is finding another Earth. Not an Earthlike planet, but another Earth. Another Earth with a small window of time say, the Pleistocene, when we evolved.. Humans can't survive the enivronment much past the last third of a billion years on Mother Earth, and the majority of the time where we can survive, we wouldn't like it. It would be a hostile alien world. Now consider candidates in our Solar system. There are none.   City on Mars knocks down all the Star Trek/For All Mankind fantasies, as it should. Cory Doctorow has a good review.Colonization makes no sense even if we could do it, which we can't. The pitch for becoming a multi-planetary species falls apart when you recognize that 99.9% of extinction are extra-solar. You want to hide in the heart of a dead planet? Fine, but not me. I'll take the blast.Manned space makes less sense especially now when robots are so cheap. Cheaper than slaves. Yes, there are more slaves than ever today. We are in a dark time, and we fantasize a safe and bland haven of normalcy. Space ain't it, honey bunniesOther things. Speaking of hostile alien environments, this is a lame blizzard so far. Chicago, City of the Future, western citadel of the sweet water seas, pissed off because we are getting Kentucky weather, WTF. Rain and above freezing? I get the El Nino but still, our weather is gonna be wimpy from now on? This sucks. I don't want to live in Tennessee. I'll move to Finland if I have to.."},
{"title": "John Carpenter's The Thing", "date": "Sunday, December 31, 2023", "text": "I rewatched this 1982 classic and it is a greeat piece of Red Scare witchhunt paranoia. Thinking about the movie's ending and opening credits scene, I think I know how a sequel would play out. To quote from my memory hut:In 1938 John Campbell wrote a science fiction novella called \"Who Goes There?\" Later it was adapted into two movies. The first movie by Howard Hawks, \"The Thing From Another World\", was considered a science fiction horror movie classic. The second movie, John Carpenter's \"The Thing\", conforms more to the original story. In Hawks' version, the monster is your standard humanoid monster, ala Frankenstein's monster. In Carpenter's version, it is much more alien, more like the Blob - all consuming, but with that imposter twist - and the accompanying paranoia as to whom to trust.I've read Campbell's novella, and it scared the hell out me. I'll tell you why. One of the more delicious fears one can have is not fear of death, but fear of lack of control. The alien creature doesn't just consume you. It imitates you. It enslaves you. It mutilates your mind and will, and binds you to service it. The other factor is just the right amount of information. In a horror flick, or in a story, you need just enough information to know that something is a threat, perhaps even an existential threat, but not so much information that you are familiar with the threat. This has always been a problem in movies. How much of the monster do you show? Not enough, and it is all just boring. Too much, and the monster is just another character.There is a defining scene in Campbell's story when the humans realize that even the tiniest piece of monster can take over an organism. And when one character realizes that their cows have not been monitored against \"infection\", and that they have all been drinking the milk.\"Mac, how long have the... cows been... not cows?\" It's a great creepy moment, when he realizes, in a fit of revulsion, hysteria, and self-loathing, that he may be a Thing and not even know it.The end scene is MacReady (Kurt Russell) and Childs (Keith David) sitting among a ruined camp, soon to freeze to death. There is indecision whether one of both of them is the Thing. MacReady points out they are in no position to do anything about it. They share a bottle of whiskey as the fire dies down and the dark and cold close in. If either of them is a Thing. one cell passed by whiskey makes two Things. Carpenter said he has the answer but won't say. It goes like this:Point being the Earth is probably doomed. Not from the crashed Thing, but what was chasing it. In the opening credits scene, the flying saucer's flight path is erratic, probably damaged, and crashing on Earth is both an act of desperation and an attempt to hide. From something worse than the Thing.The Thing might be a criminal or refugee or a larger threat to things like us out there. It is unlikely the things like us will have any sympathy towards us things like them. One sequel would be where the Thing talks to us, through somebody, giving us a choice to live because these things like us from the galaxy are going to blast the planet otherwise, just to be sure. So, do we become Things and maybe survive.No, I think my sequel would be presented as the aliens chasing the Thing versus us, only at the end to find out we were Things all along and didn't know it."},
{"title": "What Happens When the AI Bubble Pops", "date": "Wednesday, December 20, 2023", "text": "We've had lots of market bubbles, some more harmful than others. The tech dotcom bust was bad and in some ways we still have not recovered. The mortage crisis, the crypto market, NFTs and now AI.The problem is you start out with a useful thing and it gets abused, rideshare apps turn into Ubers, blockchain into Bitcoins, LLMs into ChatGPTs.  But, like abandoned malls, each bubble left something useful behind.  Cory Doctorow wrote a Locus column about this stuff. Think about some 21st century bubbles. The dotcom bubble was a terrible tragedy, one that drained the coffers of pension funds and other institutional investors and wiped out retail investors who were gulled by Superbowl Ads. But there was a lot left behind after the dotcoms were wiped out: cheap servers, office furniture and space, but far more importantly, a generation of young people who'd been trained as web makers, leaving nontechnical degree programs to learn HTML, perl and python. This created a whole cohort of technologists from non-technical backgrounds, a first in technological history. Many of these people became the vanguard of a more inclusive and humane tech development movement, and they were able to make interesting and useful services and products in an environment where raw materials – compute, bandwidth, space and talent – were available at firesale prices.Cory goes on about crypto and NFTs and AI and notes that all of these things are incredibly energy intensive and requires water hog server farms which  require lots of people with  high technical skills. When you consider the average human brain runs on 40 watts of power, AI doesn't look so super in terms of computation over energy use. For that matter, the sheer computational waste on useless mining calculations or frivolous queries is tantamount to just worst kind of circle jerks. Take self-driving cars, which have blown through 100 billion dollars and still require supervision. It has been estimated that we could have (had) commercial nuclear fusion for 200 billion dollars and yet the amount spent on fusion research is a pittance compared to replacing reliable but expensive human drivers with flawed robots.What is the real problem is that all of these bubbles are based upon fraud, grift and lies. (Not surprising as the salient of capitalism is force and fraud. There is little to be done about this so long as it is profitable.)\\What Cory points out it what is left afterwards? In some cases, like his example above, obstacles become opportunities, and in others, nothing goods comes from it:Or think of Worldcom vs Enron. Both bubbles were built on pure fraud, but Enron's fraud left nothing behind but a string of suspicious deaths. By contrast, Worldcom's fraud was a Big Store con that required laying a ton of fiber that is still in the ground to this day, and is being bought and used at pennies on the dollar.So, what about AI?  There are useful applications, the equivalent of crows and wolves that can efficiently and effectively disassemble a real world problem into data carrion. Others? If the bubble pops and the companies deflate or bust entirely, what of some actually useful applications no longer supported? I keep thinking of people with medical technology in them that is orphaned by bankrupt tech companies or organizations gutted by private equity. The reason there is a scare about AGI or human or superhuman level AI is because the companies with very large investments would like very much for the open source methods to go away and they can earn/hide their profits by good old fashioned bullying or theft, via the time-tested rentier system. I  have pointed out somewhere in this memory hut, we've had AGI for thousands of years and it is called government. In smaller more specialized versions called corportations. We have already seen these entities to pursue their own utility functions to he detriment of us regular folks. I'm less worried about AI safety and more worried about fairness, privacy, criminality and bias than I am about robot overlords.  Other things. I keep thinking of the weird right wing religous bullshit that seems to be getting more stirdent, or more press. Given the woeful state of journalism, (and AI hasn't helped, but it s not AIs fault, its greedy executives are pulling this turd) I'm guess just sensationalist press. Still, this shit fest with abortion and fetus as a person.I should note that most human embryos naturally die after conception. Spontaneous abortion is perfetly natural. Nonviable cell clusters disintegrate before attaching to the uterus. So the quesion I have to ask those who believe that life begins at conception: why are so many people commiting suicide? That's a sin, right? Why does God permit this unless it is part of His Plan. Maybe God just really likes killing babies.Also, I got spiffed up for a holiday party.I clean up well.I think I accidentally go some powerful tattoos. Or maybe it is me.If I were playing a part, the obvious one is Hitler's butler, because I bet you I could pass."},

A breakthrough for a wearable device to access the brain is being developed. Not surprising, given networks were reverse engineered from neurons because we couldn't figure it out. Neural networks get used to filtering out stuff and call it noise. These thinking caps (like we are stuck in the 1920s Monkey Singularity) successfully interpret thought. Verbs more accurately than nouns, but a promising start. And if this can be done as a wearable, it can be done remotely. If a brain can be read remotely, can it also be written?

Complexity looks more like scale invariant. You'd think it woud be simple, linear, and we can choose things that do that, but this chart does not measure complexity.

If  anything, the protist stage, the mechanics of archaeon or bacteria, are far more complex than a human society consisting of a few billion people, a few quadrillions of cells, a few septillion molecules.True, our human biofilm is getting big, our infrastructure trillions of pounds to one pound of flesh, but there are structures far vaster on Earth (made even vaster if scaled up to our size). Protists and fungi enjoy global connectivity. There is evidence that life goes right on down to the mantle, and could outnumber surface life to be the majority of species on Earth. There could be a plate tectonic network for all we know. Point being, complexity is scale invariant. Complexity is a dimensionless constant.Looking at the chart, what I get is maybe we are too small for aliens to notice.Other things.No mosquitoes this summer. True, we are in drought.

Or started a crack and the bruxism kept on worrying it until cracked to the bone.I experienced a lot of needless suffering before going to the dentist, but mainly because it quit hurting as much, I waited for my regular dental appointment. The dentist looked at it and said you that's coming out and you are an idiot for not coming in when it hurt. People can still die of tooth abcesses and, do die.I also have a massive tori, a bone spur, on my left jaw which had to be addressed. The tori are there acting like flying buttresses holding the teeth in place while I try to grind their enamel into chalk.The oral surgeon was great. I already told him it would be a local, as I had been under twice this year and didn't need another IQ drop. He was cutting my jaw up like he was going to eat it. He showed me the tori bits of bone and they were the most perfect white and smooth as plastic. I asked about the tooth and he brushed that off. After they were done I snuck a peak the surgeon's tray and there is the tooth.Hm. Took a bit of jaw out with it but I'm healing fine. Follow up today and he said wow beautifully healed.Happy Labor Day! My niece and great niece, I think she's 8 or 9, came in for a family reunion on my sister-in-law's side. We had time before they went to the shindig, so my brother - papa - and I took the youngster up to Lake Michigan. She is from Kansas and has never seen a large body of water.Papa says keep youreye out for a big blue horizon, and as we top the last dune to see the lake-\"It's an Ocean!\" she exclaimed. It's the Big Lake. All other lakes in nowrthwest Indiana have names to clarify but if you say we were at the lake, most would ask The Big Lake? Parking is a premium but we finally found a spot when someone pulled out. We made our way down from the road to the beach over boulders and rocks and then orcks and pebbles. My poor feet have hardly been barefoot this summer so there were lots of ooches and ouches out of Uncle John. Made it down to sand and water. The water temperature is 70-72F which is about as warm as it gets. The child complained when dipping toe and  wave washed foot but we said she would get used to it. She did.I went in with her and after a little bit of a heart attack I was fine too. Papa took pictures from the shore.I grew up here, ten mles south of Lake Michigan. Every chance I could get I would head to the Dunes. Summers in high school I practically lived there. When I hitch-hiked through Europe in 1976, I had on my itinerary great beaches. I almost didn't leave Denmark. I'm told the north coast of Germany (the Florida of Germany, where my dad's family is from) is even better. I could have gone to East Germany in'76, but it wasn't worth the hassle. I had flirted with the idea of hiking the Pacific coast of Baja California, until I read a book by guy who tried to do it. It was a nightmare and he almost died. Finally rescued by fisherman. All the towns on his map were ruins.The kid was right. It's an ocean, and I am a son of that ocean."},
{"title": "The Alien Cinematic Universe", "date": "Thursday, August 10, 2023", "text": "Recovering from my hernia operation I watched a lot of movies from the library and kept up with the habit. New stuff or previously unseen, favorites, and also some second chances. Two of those second chances were Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. Both were stinkers with some good parts and the redeemable parts are why I rewatched them. Because I am a tinkerer of masturbatory parts I had to somehow reationalize the bullshit of these two films. Not that the prior 4 alien films (I'm ignoring AVP for now) aten't problematic but didn't need a rational backstory. Item: soon after the original alien came out, I'm in a bar with my coding geek coworkers and we got to talking about the weird Alien movie and the convoluted way the alien reproduced. I pointed out that parasitism is a vast and highly lucrative evoluionary niche, but the way the facehugger huged faces would suggest design. Too specific of  a vector, and Ridley Scott confirmed that aliens are designed.. These things are bioweapons. Multiply that in the movie Aliens .The Alien franchise also inhabits the same universe as Bladerunner (and a 1998 Kurt Russell movie called Soldier} with replicants of those films being organic and eventually synthetic like Ash, Bishop, David and Walter and Call. This connection to Bladerunner/Soldier confirmed that humans had FTL transport, massive (fusion?) power generation to move gigantic shit around the stars. The other commonality is artificial general intelligence, which is far huger than mere fusion power. You see, once you have such a substrate, like a Universal Turing machine, you can run any conscious software that you like, human or alien. Couple it to a material insturmentality and you have protean technology. The only thing scarier is giving this access to life forms, input and output tailored for whatever by what looks like a black goo. (Per Sir Ridley, the black goo can only infect animal forms not plant. Its a rationalization to keep the human protagonists being eaten alive by the grass itself when they set off the lander).So the black goo is the real villain here. Eating everything in its path to satisfy its objective function. In all the movies, there is no will or intent from this stuff except to spread. David, the android from the 2 prequel movies, is the designer of the xenomorph, but he is using another being's workshop and tools (the Engineers). Alien Covnenant is a glorious mess, but it solidifies where the prequels end and the first Alien begins.What is harder to explain is that humans (per Prometheus) are engineered. In that movie, we see the replicant version of the Engineer species, the Space Jockeys, giants 8 to 14 feet tall. They are not androids, but biological replicants just like Decker and Kurt Russell's character in Soldier. (The story of Soldier is how the synthetics were favored by the corporation over \"obsolete\" replicant soldiers) As biological replicants, and unlike synthetics, they are vulnerable to the black goo, which is why the planets in Prometheus or Covenant are not the Engineer home or colony worlds. They were military bases. Go back and look at the Covenant footage when the Juggernaut docks and before David bombs them all with goo, they have the look of soldiers and airmen at Tinian welcoming back the Enola Gay from bombing Hiroshima. And then the goo hits the fans.The alien world in Prometheus was both Area 51 and a strike base for the Engineer race, clearly. The hubris of humans to waltz in was well depicted, arrogant stupid little monkeys.In the confrontation scene between awakened Space Jockey and Weyland, Sir Ridley tells us David asked the alien \"This man wants to know if he can have more life\".  The Space Jockey carresses David's hair, and then picks him up and rips his head off. The Space Jockey is enraged because their black goo weapon had sent back dolls. What the fuck am I going to do with these things as ground troops? Cancel the whole batch.Can you blame the guy? We were supposed to be super weapons like the xenomorphs.Where does this leave us?  The first and last question of this whole film series is why the goo? Who is the Eneny that so frightens them they create this doomsday goo? I can't see it being a rival facion of their own species. At this point you can throw in the AVP universe and suppose the Predators are their enemy but I think not.There's something scary out there, if you think about it. Way scarier than jump scare monsters. In future Alien movies, here are known facts. 1 David is still alive and has a planetary laboratory on Origa 4 or whatever. 2 The Engineers are out there and they are still at war with some Enemy.3 The Enemy is out there as well4 Earth is a legitimate target to the section 51 crowd."},

Leave it to an American to take time off from work for a medical procedure and then call it a vacation. Meanwhile all my friends and acquaintances are on vacation and I'm eating a toasted cheese sandwich.Eight weeks on from the operation and I still have tender spots but I'm heading for heavy lifting. I've babied myself for seven weeks and hit the gym last week, so this is week 2 of I assume 9-10 weeks of trying to get to my remembered peak at 60 when I was a fucking animal.I remember once at the gym this kid, big muscle kid in his 20s asked 'scuse me sir but how old are you? 60, I said.  60!!! Dude you are my hero.We Kurmans are naturally muscular so I was a fucking animal from 17 on anyways. But I had a schedule at 60 I started at 20: two upper body days, two legs days, core and kettle bells on Friday. Run every day. In my 20s I was a werewolf. Now I'm a silverback, longer to heal and recover. Intermittent fasting got me from my pre-op fat slob weight of 224 down to current 214. I see no shrink of the belly but what would I do without my fat anyway?I took a fitness evaluation and I got superior (for my age). I walk almost everyday and try to get in at least 2.5 miles. My resting heart rate is 64. My suspicion is I'm gonna be an old Norwegian fisherman and hit the high 90s. I can't afford that. Aside from the VR and animation, I've been looking at AI art, and what I like is not the AI and the prompts so much as the centaurs. Centaurs, the people using the AI to make stuff. There is still uncanny valley, a seeping in of nightmare realities in the images and videos. Now that artists are using their own images and prompts to embellish, I've seen some neat stuff. I like where it is going. Motion picture and TV wise, my prediction is the public will want authenticity at some point and we see more practical effects and a big revival (with the help of AI) of light weight sets, now self-assembling sets what with the robots. Perfect for quick change in the theater. What you tihnk theater is going away? Ha! AI and robots are supergay, perfect for the theater. Folks get tired ot all the CGI magic.A hugre impact now already is editing, and AI is all over that.Directing a picture is just creating a camera roll. The editor makes the picture. A kickass centaur film editor, or team, can give you some kickass editing. Already been happening.LK-99 anyone? I'm still waitng for more replications since the procedure is published and simple. So far, not good for room temperature, but they got superconductor at -160C, not bad and way above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. A chinese lab has got magnetic levitation, but no one yet gets both. This copper-doped lead apatite is polycrystalline, so it is possible there is a pathway matrix that works, perhaps like a lead lined highway with copper bumper guards, that they need to isolate. The Korean papers said superconducting as high as 60-90C, which is the high one hundreds which makes this discovery not just astounding but ready for hard, dirty work. And wouldnt' it be ironic if the call for lead caused us to clean up all the tainted lead sites, and buried cable and pipe,  to make superconducting circuits, wire and cable?"},

I've told the joke about how all that radioactive fallout and never-before-seen chemical poisons, toxins, heavy metals, excretions forced upon the Boomer generation. Maybe not the Most Poisoned generation, but for sure the Most-Novelty/Variety-Of-Poisoned generation. Thanks to simpering liberal pussy regulations, the air and water are SO much cleaner than when I was a youth, and yet not before Gen X breathed more leaded gas fumes than any childhood generation, Millenials get their PCBs and PFAS and who knows how much nanoplastic. What of Gen Z, awaiting some unknown horror, some time bomb from the Aughts?See, I've already lost the joke, let me cut and paste it in from this essay.All those atmospheric tests, all that radiation affecting the brain development of human fetuses, anyone born after, say, 1954, is severely and profoundly retarded. And so, our parents, and older brothers and sisters, have worked feverishly to create a Fisher-Price civilization to accommodate all of us Boomers & progeny.I told this fantasy at a family gathering once, and got a laugh out of everyone except my parents. They gave me the cold fish eye, and maybe even looked at each other and thought \"What do you know, he's on to us\".Idiocracy.If I brought someone (you!) back 14,000 years ago, people back then would see us as fairies. Light boned, weak , but tall and comely of face and limb. No wings. Not fairies. They would also figure out we are stupid. Not know how to do anything. Don't even know how to make a fire. Don't have all of civilization packed in one or ten skulls. Shitty memories. Easily distracted. We would appear to neolithic humans as human do to Klingons: Klingon children.You want my conspiracy theory? The most boring day in history, April 11, 1954.Some kind of cosmic horror shit hit the fan. Who can say what it was but everyone wants to forget. Especially in the USA but It happened everywhere. If you want to call it alien, for common purpose? There was no take me to your leader stuff. Everyone had an alien in the head, talking at the same time.Am I saying it was aliens? I just used that as one example, but Something Happened, or Something Went Wrong, or we are just an angry ghost of a planet. Regardless, some people have the skinny on what happened. And those people are looting the Earth of everything, furiously scrambling, and why? Because there's a deadline. And it takes a lot of moneyto get to escape velocity. To what end? Death awaits all.

I wrote a prior essay about this, called The Interminable Dicklessness of the Political Right. Feel free to read it before continuing.I had a discussion with my brother about this. He considers himself a conservative and all the squawking hens on the media are, according to him, not conservative. They are the radical right. The last vestige of the so-called patriarchy.The term has been bandied about, and though I consdier it a bit simplistic, there is evidence that it is a ephemeral thing, possessed of both imperfection and impermanence. The narrative goes that the patriarchy started with the arrival of horse riding bornze age central asians migrating into Europe. But that is too simplistic an explanation. Archaeological digs of the steppe peoples and their descendants find a lifestyle equivalent to rodeo people today, with all the broken bones and impressive physiques read from their bones. One thing to note is the women are just as busted up and sturdy as the men, indicating no division of labor by sex. Move forward a few thousand years, and my northern barbarian ancestors display a similar lack of division of labor. One can easily find burial mounds of Viking queens as of Viking kings. In fact, Vikings were equal opportunity employers. One can find burial mounds of chiefs who were not ethnically Scandinavia, including one treasure horde found with a viking chieftain of African origins.Point being the patriarchy is neither permanent nor perfect and situations for the past 99.9999% of human existence shows a shared lifestyle egalitarian and equal.So, what to make of today's big babies? Case in point: Ben Shapiro annoying little fly was so upset about the Barbie movie that he set dolls on fire. Which means (not unlike Kid Rock shooting up Bud Light cans) he went out and bought the product so he could videotape his temper tantrum.  What to make of this? Aside from the dopamine thrill of media exposure, I can only think to say fucking grow up. Or move to an island of similar weenies to circle stroke the spot where once your peens existed."},

I mean, it should be wild Frankenstein light show, but the figure as ground is my artificial rule and ground is everything.It took me maybe 30 minutes to an hour for one second of video, but you get mindful of how it strings together in time, the space works itself out as you move stuff and take pictures.

The joke is most of what we do,we do autopilot, because, again, survival machines.A nuclear booster rocket. No fuckiing way anyone would want this, but- If you use an unshielded core, the weight to thrust vastly exceeds chemical rockets. It has been determined that you can cluster nuclear rockets without them setting each other off, and with the cargo shielded by the hydrogen fuel, an easy ground to orbit and back again, 3-4 runs on one tank of fuel. Radiation? Hell yes! One has to worry about anything within 50 miles of your rocket field (not to mention a tidal wave of legistlation to prevent redress from the atomic rocket corporations I'm guessing Nevada passes state laws to open up atomic rocket ranges.. Nevada is the future of US states)Anyway, with an unshielded thermal nuclear engine core, you are gettting spectacular blue Cherenkov radiation (eyeballs melting? too close!) from spitfire neutrons hitting atmosphere. Those neutrons are sterilizing everything down to viruses and weird proteins for thousands of yards, and it is the most peculiar form of taxidermy known to this writer. Your fuel can be the preferred hydrogen, but methane and water will do.

{"title": "Nuclear Thermal Rocket Engine", "date": "Thursday, June 22, 2023", "text": "Searching through my memory hut, the most comprehensive essay I had on this subject was in this post, Stuck In the 20s. I'm very disappointed in myself. I thought I had gone into more detail than I did.Recovering from umbilical hernia surgery, I stopped at the library prior to the operation to pick up reading materials, some new and some favorites. I looked for Atomic Accidents by James Mahaffey which had entertained me before and found it checked out. Fortunately, Atomic Adventures by the same author was available, and lo and behold, he had a chapter on the thermal nuclear rocket program. Now, there is any amount of declassified material available on the internet, but few that is understandable to the average US citizen (read: morons). As this was a worthwhile chapter (entitled the Lost Expedition to Mars) I figured I'd provide some of the goodies.As mentioned in my prior essay, Elon Musk is wasting our time with chemical rockets. Not only is the Solar System out of our grasp with this technology, but simple Earth to Low Orbit transportation is also wasteful and long-term cost ineffective as well. If humans want to exploit space, we need nuclear booster tugs to get stuff out there. Damn the radation and crashes, there is no other way to do it.So, I have to assume I am stuck in this dark timeline where, rather than dying and frying investigating refractory tehcnologies on Venus, I must watch a catfight between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg in a Las Vegas cage.Pathetic. Nuclear rockets could have been so easy, that, in some brighter timeline, even the Romans could have made a nuclear rocket, had they the knowledge*. Starting in the the 1950s, Los Alamos scientists got to work building nuclear thermal rockets. This consisted of an atomic pile of graphite and uranium fuel used to heat liquid hydrogen to propel itself. Not to demean the genius and talents of scientists and engineers that worked on it, but, like the atomic pile itself, the thing practically willed itself into existence, given the ease with which matter, arranged properly, obeyed the simple wish to fly up into the sky.(Seriously, the time from the startup of Enrico Fermi's Chicago Pile 1 until the final experiments which solidified atomic pile reactor design was 90 days. The patent for a neutronic reactor, US Patent number 2,708,656, would not be made public until 1955).A little known fact is that the nuclear engine, or if you will, the proton rocket engine (given that heated and ejected hydrogen gas particles are protons) was to be the third stage of the Saturn V rocket. Werner von Braun approved it without a flinch, and had not the program been pressed for time, they'd have used it.Back in the 1950s, the atomic rocket was developed in conjunction with the atomic jet plane, the problem being how to lob these massively huge hydrogen bombs down upon Soviet heads. The bomb was shrunk down enough that conventional rockets would work. (In fact, the thousands of pounds of Sputnik II and Yuri Gargarin's capsule were flung into space atop arrayed banks of WWII V2 rocket engines, much as Musk plans to do with his Buck Rogers dildo Starship). The atomic jet plane was killed off, but work on atomic rockets continued until cancellation in 1973. Imagine what we would have now with proven 50-year-old nuclear rocket technologies.Doctor Mahaffey: \"The advantage of a nuclear rocket over chemical rockets is the efficient use of fuel, as designated by its specfic impulse (SI). SI which is expressed in seconds, is the \"hang time\" of a rocket, or the maximum number of seconds it can accelerate, balancing against the pull of  Earth's gravity and hanging still above the ground. The SI depends on many factors, such as the weight of the fuel which must be carried and the speed of the mass exhaust leaving the engine. The faster the flying gas exits the nozzle, the more reaction is derived, and the speed of the gas is due to its temperature and weight of the gas particles. The lightest possible gas is hydrogen which is the perfect propellent for a nuclear engine. For a chemical engine, the lightest possible (LH2/LOX) combustion product is steam, which is 18 times the weight of a hydrogen particle or proton. The F-1 engines used in the Saturn V, burning kerosene in liquid oxygen, had an SI of 350 seconds. The theoretical limit to a steam exhaust rocket is 450 seconds. A SpaceX Raptor engine has an SI of 380 seconds. The SI for a nuclear rocket starts at 900 seconds and can increase, in theory, into the millions of seconds.\"The Rocketdyne F-1 engine, burning through olympic sized pools of propellant, lasted 165 seconds on the first stage of the Saturn V. It could only be started once and its only throttle setting is full thrust. A NERVA  nuclear rocket engine can be run for 10 hours, stopped and restarted sixty times (chilled down by space to near absolute zero an brought up to 2750F in minutes, and can throttle from full thrust to barely moving. Reactor core designs, U235 and graphite, pinned together with stainless steel rods and tungsten ranged from 4000 megawatts to 600 megawatts. In May 1971, the smallest refined nuclear engine, Peewee, weighed just 11 pounds and had a SI of 1000 seconds. It ran for two hours at a blistering 4145F degrees.Doctor Mahaffey: \"(from 1955 on, Los Alamos developed) Five reactor (U235) core designs with power ratings ranging from 600 to 2000 megawatts using graphite as a neutron moderator. Their aggressively odd code names were Uncle Tom, Uncle Tung, Bloodhound, Shish, and Old Black Joe\".(Clearly racist names but hand waved away due to working with black-as-ink graphite would quickly turn technicians into black faced, black handed minstrel show characters. Racial sensitivity being nonexistent then, but I can't help feeling there was a grudging recognition that if you wanted sheer brute strength and stamina, old negroe men were an archetype for a nuclear rocket). \"Old Black Joe, designed to run at 1200 megawatts of power, was approved in Novermber 1956 for continued development. The design was upgraded to 2700 megawatts and plans were to use it as for a range-extending second stage for the Atlas missile. This Super Atlas would be capable of parking a heavy H-bomb in geosynchronous orbit hovering above Moscow ready to pounce at a moment's notice. It would be 9.6 feet in in diameter and 96.6 feet high, and to the delight of the Air Force, it would seem a better idea than carrying missiles around in submarines. The bad news was it would take an eye-watering one billion dollars to develop.\"(Keep in mind a decade later the US of A would be spending 2 billion dollars a month in Vietnam).\"At this point in 1956, no nuclear rocket engine had ever been built and the technology consisted of designs on paper and a few computer simulations.\"(in 1956 95% of all electronic computer calculations were devoted to simulating nuclear processes. Without  a burgeoning need for computers from the defense sector, there woudn't have been enough demand for commercial development and you, gentle reader, would not be reading this on a magical glass box)\"The mind numbing list of impossibilities didn't seem to bother the engineering climate of the time. The fuel pump would take a frozen hydrogen slush at -434F, near absolute zero, and push it at a rate of 70 pounds per second into the top of a nuclear reactor running at two billion watts. No such pump existed. No nuclear reactor had ever run at that power level. In 52 inches, from the hydrogen intake to the nozzle, the liquified fuel would go from near abosulte zero to 3682F through multiple mechanically chaotic phase changes and a severe pressure drop that would try to suck the core out of the end of the engine. The fuel, liquid hydrogen, was the most corrosive substance known, and while sittting quietly in the storage tank would diffuse into all the metal structures it touched, rendering them more brittle than mere freezing would make them. Nothing was know about how stray neutrons from the reactor would interact with hydrogen slush in the fuel tank, whether two nuclear rockets sitting side by side would cause each other to go supercritical via neutron exchange, or how to keep the hot unsupported end of the reactor, glowing incandescent, from following the hydrogen gas out the rocket nozzle.\"\"(Rocketdyne was contracted to design the fuel pump and nozzle (the nozzle jacketed to flow liquid hydrogen so it didn't melt) and Aerojet General Nucleonics did the plumbing. The Soviets had their own secret nuclear rocket program in their RD-0410 engine. Their project began in 1965 after clandestine observation of American efforts, but was stopped after Chernobyl in 1986. Their engineers were never able to master the intricacies of pumping liquid hydrogen or even keeping it in a tank. They never put a comrade on the Moon. Think of the money they saved)\".What about radiation? Fuck that noise we're going to Mars. To mollify the proles, talk was always that the nuclear engine would be launched by conventional means, and should an oopsie occur it would be outside the contamination-sensitive atmosphere. But oopsies do occur and it was recognized that stuff would fall to Earth eventually. Studies showed that activation at 100,000 feet or in LEO would result in the same amount of radiation as blasting off from ground zero nuclear engines ablaze. Hydrogen exhaust is not radioactive. An added bonus of ground launch is that the thousands of degrees hydrogen exhaust would combust with atmospheric oxygen, boosting the rocket further. Besides, daily radioactive fallout from cosmic rays hitting Earth's atmosphere far exceed the danger of nuclear rocket exhaust.What about crashes? During the decades of tests of the various nuclear rocket configurations at Jackass Flats Nevade, yes, chunks of the reactor would occasionally break loose and fly out. Often times no big deal and they would continue operating the rocket regardless. KIWI-B1B, in September 1962 operated at 965 megawatts almost to the target 1000 megawatts.\"It hung there for 100 seconds, despite the fact that the core was still leaving in chunks. It ran for a few more minutes, control drums rotating to maintain criticality, until a nozzle sensor blew out and a fire started. All in all, it was seen as a successful run. Back in Washington, details of the KIWI-B1B test were interpreted differently, and key people in charge of the budget had to be peeled off the walls by Werner von Braun at a hearing. These nuclear rockets were to be used for Earth-Moon shuttles to and from a Moon base, and we could not have pieces of engines flying willy-nilly hither and yon. Even wihout a Mars mission, the nuclear rocket program was important if the manned spaceflight program was going to be something other than an isolated moment of glory\".Again, what about crashes? Oh, well, if you are going to get snippy about it. Development of the nuclear engines was turned over to Westinghouse for construction, but in 1965 Los Alamos decided to end its KIWI program with a bang. \"NASA, always safty conscious had asked what's the worst that can happen? That would probably be toppling off the top of the Saturn V booster, where it was scheduled to be the last of three boost stages for the manned Moon shot. Los Alamos dropped a KIWI 75 feet onto a concrete pad, to see if it would somehow throw the reactor into uncontrolled criticality, which they knew would not happen. That's interesting said NASA but but it's a 300 foot drop off a Saturn. Los Alamos took the challenge, bolted a KIWI to a rocket sled and slammed it into a concrete barrier at high speed. Then, to top it off, they put together a special KIWI, cleverly named KIWI-TNT, having controls that could be slammed into the full-on position with pneumatic cylinders, putting the reactor into prompt critical mode all of a sudden. The reactor exploded in a blue flash with a blast equivalent of 300 pounds of black gunpowder, scattering its remains over a 1700 foot radius. Over half of it was found and picked up eventually (by hand).\" No problem, I guess, considering Jackass Flats was surrounded by nuclear test sites. NASA canned the engine as a third stage for Apollo, feeling that development was moving too slowly.  What if the engine had been dropped from space? Oh, well, the Soviets routinely did that with the Kosmos series. Ho hum.So there you have it. DARPA and NASA are working on nuclear rockets again, but I can't help but feel that by this time, given real world use of nuclear rocket boosters, we could be putting aircraft carriers moving back and forth from orbit at this point. Hi ho!"},

Still, half the class dropped, so there's that.I'm going to post a Youtube link of the Project 5, my final project. I also had to write a paper.ART 241Project 5”Sometime After The End Of The World”By John Kurman This filmstarted from two pictures I made in January 2020 on Adobe Medium, near thestart of the pandemic lockdown. Work was physically closed and soon to beonline, I had little to do but go for long walks in my neighborhood. Most ofthe time I would see dogwalkers and moms with baby strollers. At the time, theseriousness of the COVID virus was becoming appreciated, and I found that Itreated my fellow walkers with some caution. One day, a fellow and I werewalking past each other, each eyeing the other for plague symptoms I suppose,and we warily waved at each other. Mutual suspicion and maybe a mild rancorhidden under a shallow amity was what I got from that encounter and decided todocument it as a sculpt (a VR file containing the 3D staged scene). When I gothome, I created the sculpt of the two robots and took pictures. So the shortfilm I created kind of took three years to make.Could19-year-old Johnny have made this short film? Not without a lot of explosionsand pow-pow, blammo, blown to smithereens sparkly special effects. Thesymbolism (if any) would have had the subtlety of a sledge hammer strapped toan atomic bomb. There is an advantage to age and experience which hopefullymakes this short film more of an elegiac narrative than action flick.After tryingout short animations, I decided that a graphic novel format using sequences ofstills was more practical and appropriate for the tone and mood I wanted. Icreated the still pictures from snapshots of scenes I made in Medium by Adobe,a VR sculpting program that is an analog of clay manipulation to create 3Dobjects. The two robot figures (and crows) were 3D assets that I eitherobtained from asset libraries off the internet, or used a figurative kitbash methodfrom a posing program called Design Doll. The landscape was created in Medium,but I deceptively used stagecraft, lighting, and scale to make basically twopizza slices of barren hills and snowy plains combined and rearranged for theillusion of a much larger landscape.The onlyanimated portions (done in Adobe Illustrator) are the internal visor displaysof the robots, which, like Chekov’s gun, shown in the first act, used in thethird act. I wanted the visor display to convey robot status and intent whenthings go mysteriously pear-shaped.The plot isstraight forward and linear, two robots on patrol, each the last remnant of adead civilization, following their algorithms of guarding a now wasted terrainafter, I guess, the Last War. The mystery enters when a set of footprintsunknown to either party appears in the snow. The first actis Silverbot’s story, rather hum drum except for a brief wolf encounter (thewolves categorized as harmless). Silverbot runs into Goldiebot, they exchangeperfunctory greetings, and the story is handed over to a Goldiebot second act.Goldiebot surprises some crows which were feeding on remains of a wolf kill.Quick cut back to Silverbot, who is surprised by a crow that causes it (him?)to notice a set of tiny human(?) footprints that were not there before.Cut back toGoldiebot discovering a similar set of footprints. They both go on Red Alert,hightail it on the tracks after the mystery intruders. When they confront eachother, they find the tiny footprints stop where they stand. Both apparentlyhave enough wits not to blast each other with their ridiculous laser cannons,and they stand puzzled for a zoom out and fade.Are theyrobots or humans in armored suits? Hopefully, the impression is that they arerobots sophisticated enough for humanlike interaction and restraint. Twoarmored humans or cyborgs would probably have blasted each other, which Iconsidered as an ending...Silverbot isunfortunately just a rip-off from the Cybermen from the TV series Doctor Who.Goldiebot just kind of fell together as I was modifying the 3D asset manikin.So there you go. About as much as I could dowith my winter plague encounter made into a show.Here is the video:"},

Men's rooms were sacrificed, and that makes sense as men can go anywhere, like animals. I am a big fan of the all gender, because they are deluxe. Single room toilet and sink, a diaper changing station, condom and feminine product dispensers, and most importantly, well ventilated. A nice quiet, contemplative private dump and I have transsexuals to thank for it.Public bathrooms vary in quality but a distressing common trait is very poor ventilation. Smelling someone's morning poo in the afternoon type of very poor ventilation. I assume it would cost too much for a separate bad air removal system, more ductwork and motors and fans, but geez. I have, as a slacker, always shit on company time, which makes me a mostly informed public shitter, and I can say without a doubt, that it would be nice to bring them up to all gender standards.Anyways. I did a stop motion which I will show you in a minute. I had access to 8mm and Super8 back in high school. Never did the drawn on paper stuff. Iwas all about claymation. After college, I found a 44mm film camera that no one wanted. The reason was the film was hard to get as 44mm was fazing out. I found a place in Brooklyn that would sell and process the films. The black and white 44mm  film quality I fell in love with, despite the hassle of limits.Dropped out of all that to be a workadaddy, but what with smartphones and stupid AI and laptops and computers, it makes sense to get back in it. It could be I go mainly back to 2D stuff what with being half blind now. I am not adapting to lack of depth perception even though it has been a year Anyways, here's a short stop motion. I went into my latest VR sculpt, took pics of one figure, rotating it 4 degrees per pic full circle (90 pics). Put them into a frame-to-timeline convertor and short film. Enjoy."},

It was a nerd nightmare, where I was in the middle of a Harry Potter wizarding war. I saw a lot gruesome magical acts and tortures around me. I was untouched, almost unnoticed, walking around in the carnage, being a Muggle (which is what I am, and so are you). The wizarding war took place in the 1940s or 50s I guess, as everyone was wearing bulky long coats and hats. The chief bad wizard and his companions were suddenly in front of me., rudely crowding in, their attention upon the rooftops. I stepped forward and in half a second snapped the chief bad wizard's neck with a grab and a twist, just like on TV.\"Muggle THAT motherfuckers!\" I shouted at the other bad witches and wizards right before they magically turned my atoms to dust. I woke up before that part.Is it worth examing this dream? Not really. I do an off-and-on attempt to lucid dream. Alcohol is bad for that, as well as inhibiting REM sleep. Without alcohol, recall of REM dreams comes back with a vengeance, and that in the form of nightmares. Lots of pee nightmares I am fine with as I don't pee the bed. And as far as I know, I haven't shit the bed for decades. I'll have a dream I shit the bed, and will wake up and search the mattress, but no turds. I always wake up from shit the bed dreams saying \"Oh no!\"Shit the bed means to really fuck up bad. I think a worse version is shit in the shower and slip on it, but shit the bed is so concise, so context rich, that it works in any language, in any era. Anyway lucid dreams. The path is through the nightmares as I am closest to awake. It's just a matter of time and patience. It's gonna be a bummer when I do it and it's not the magic bullet. Americans rely overmuch on the quick fix, magic bullet, the technocratic balm, the unicorn rainbow.Maybe you can't tell, but I am in my manic phase. I suffer from Fragile Kurman Syndrome of the brain.. \"What's that? you ask. \"What do you got?\" I reply.Kurmans have autism, ADHD, OCD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, etc., but measured in small amounts. A static measure, cup for cup, is not an apt metaphor, but a helical dynamism will work.That means I am easily distracted, tending toward a dilletante, a butterfly flitting from topic to topic. As do we all, but I have a focus now. Assume I go another 34 years, I will be 100 (year 2057). If I am 100 years old I am a cyborg mutant along with everyone else. Apollo 12Oh shit I wanted to die but then they offer up one thousand ten thiousands of years, well ok. whip it on me."},

{"title": "The Interminable Dicklessness of the Political Right", "date": "Thursday, January 5, 2023", "text": "Not expecting this in my feed in the latter days of 2022. For some unknown reason, Andrew Tate decided to troll Greta Thunberg on Twitter. Bragging about his devilish collection of internal combustion vehicles, he taunted Greta to reply. She did, basically telling him he displayed small dick energy and to get a life. Many out on the intertubes crowed with delight at the false narrative of Andrew Tate posting a video which, by means of pizza boxes, resulted in his arrest by Romanian authorities. We subsequently learn this was all bullshit, but still the popular culture celebrated his takedown. I, however, found Andrew Tate's immediate response on Twitter to be the most telling and devastating:\"How dare you\" he shrill shrieked in reply, voice going up in octaves, and with that, Andrew Tate's body sloughed off his penis, and it fell to the ground with a soft little plop.Top this off with Waffle House girl effortlessly catching a chair throw by a John Cena lookalike, and things are not looking at all good for the so-called Alpha Males.As I explained earlier, the classical notion of Alpha male (partly) involved not getting penetrated up the anus. Anyone who has ever received a colonoscopy falls under the pseudoscientific category of beta cuck soy boy. It is amazing how many now reside under that classification. Some, such as the founder of the Proud Boys, Gavin McIness, voluntarily inserted butt plugs up their ass. The pampered and well-monied McIness, by transitive property, has made his whole organization a shameful shamble of, well, basically beta cucks dressed up as marching band nerfs.What is going on here? I noticed the trend in a prior post about how fey and faggy the right is becoming, but now we see a whole new schema of former males now emasculated utterly, just a pee hole, pink taint and butthole to identify themselves when sniffing their minion cohort.The 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act saw lots of the soft penis right go without. They cut off their peens and handed them to donors. The donors, in turn, drove around like Lorena Bobbitt, tossing handfuls of dicks out the window.Does the penis grow back? Sadly no. They staple things to their taint, but everyone knows these totems will not stand up to tough rubbery vaginas. Why, the disheartening thing is how the majority on the political right have succumbed to this condition.Consider how, once upon a time, the political right presented a strong phalanx of limited government unity towards the rest of the world, and over time, the movement turned towards fragile masculinity, big babyification culminating in the gassy orange floater and his tiny dicked minions attempting a failed and pathetic coup. What can you say of affluent white men, freshly scrubbed from hot hotel showers, pink and scented with cheap soap, their bellies full of pancakes and sausages, dressed in an array of trashy cosplay military costumes and shoddy Chinese slogan-covered garb, had to stop at food trucks on their way to pooping in the Capitol. Why, even their great generals, like Michael Flynn, could not join the march, claiming \"fuck no, it's freezing out\". Yes, cold enough for his slight and scrawny frame to reject his little peen, should he attempt it. Roger Stone, who likes threesomes involving a for sure humiliation kink, advertising \"hitting the hard bag\" when threatened, but nowhere to be seen. So many on the Dickless Right. Tucker Carlson, who lost his peen to Jon Stewart way back in 2004 on CNN's Crossfire. Tucker has had the look of a baffled spaniel wondering what happened after that visit to the vet, ever since.Matt Gaetz, looking like a marionette ready to be cornholed in the movie Team America: World Police. The list goes on and on, but it is very hard to identify any of these weasel bitches who has a penis. Especially the current weasel bitch who wants to be Speaker of the House.Granted, there are many women on the right sporting hyena pseudopenises. Kimberly Guilfoyle comes to mind, dutifully pegging Don TRump jr, until the day she eats his head. To a lesser extent, the ape ladies, Marjorie Taylor Monkeyfart and Dildobert, grooming lice off each other. But technically they are dickless as well.I suppose the only thing left now is vicarious thrill of checking out Hunter Biden's massive boner over the next two years watching Benghazi  LApToP Theater."},

Eighth needle in the eye this year. I posted a pic after and a lovely admirer of mine posted \"Brave you are\". I don't think so. It had to happen. I had no choice. Stoic, yes, but brave? I don't think so.Interesting though how the subject turned to courage and masculinity. Why? Plenty of courageous women out there and honestly I think a far greater proportion of women display courage versus men. But somehow talk turned to masculinity and the alpha male.Alpha males versus beta males, and then gamma, delta...to omicron. But aren't omicron males in ancient greek cultures more powerrful than alphas? Who cares. It's all pseudoscience anyway, a category built to assuage men who think they deserve more than their lot, and who are probably tiny peened as well.Somehow, a guy named Nick Adams pooped into my feed. On Twitter, he is Nick Adams (Alpha Male). He has a quote as to how alpha males eat wings at Hooter's while beta males eat soy or something like that. Here is a pic of him, and as you can see, not only is he a disgusting soft body, but is originally a pudge from Australia. He can never be a red blooded fillled-to-the-brim-with-testosterone  American alpha male. I don't think he really understands the pseudoscience behind his declaration.Most of the concept of manly man goes, via the Brits, to ancient Greece. Now, the British through some rather dubious logic, traced Western civilization back to the Greeks, via a radical theory that European superiority came not from Chistianity, but from the Greeks, who invented freedom and rationality. Rome then spread these virtues to the rest of Euope, culminating, obviously, with the British Empire.Let's ignore the bullshit and run with it. By cultivating the ancient Greek version of masculinity, the manly alpha male is defined. But don't look too closely at the sexual practices of the ancients. More on that in a minute.The Greeks themselves, through the writings still extant, were positively obsessed with the Persians. Given an obvious inferiority complex towards their powerful eastern neighbors, they often lampooned Persians in a negative light. Greek art endlessly portrayed the Persians as cowardly, scheming, effeminate barbarians. The Greeks defined the Persians as the ulitmate 'Other'.For exmple, there is a wine jug, the Eurymedon vase, from about 460BCE, that celebrates a Greek victory over the Persians. On the vase a Greek hoplite (a GI Joe) humiliates a Persian soldier.The Greek is bent at waist grasping his erect penis, rushing to pentrate the Persian's rear end.\"Look at me, buggering this bloody Persian!\" says the commerative jug. This was then a common practice. Indeed, sexual mores and gender roles being what they were back then, pederasty was practiced frequently among the Greeks and the Romans.A common definition back then was that a true alpha male is never anally penetrated. It's OK to fuck anythhing else, women, men, boys, aninals were all fair game. But you were taken down a peg if it was ever known that someone had slipped the pink one in your bum - knowingly or not. (There are Roman comedies with unfortunate characters ending up as bottoms either from inebriation or accident). NIck Adams may, by this definition, be an alpha male in ancient times if he has not been buggered. But he must also bugger others to show his innate European superiority. That might happen at a Hooters. Or a locker room, or a slip on a piece of soap. But most Greek hoplites would just look at Nick and see, not a real man, but someone who can squeal real good."},

It's a promising tool, but I simply don't have time to learn it.Mrs. KrampusYou must carefully construct your text prompt. When you consider that the critter was fed on 650 million pictures and caqptions, hooking up words in a prompt to images in the output is not so simple of a task. These are algorithms that are so complex and arcane that no one understands them, searching through a vast sample space of combinations. Magic, but not a genie who easily grant wishes.Just to make sure, I asked GPT-3 to construct programming language for my own personal DALLE-2 using my images, styles, and writing. It pooped back three paragraphs explaining why it couldn't do that.The thing of DALLE-2, the \"prompt engineering\", to make best use of the API, you must be an expert in five or six fields: art history, photography, cinematography, CGI, etc.Context matters, specific prompts can have only a general effect. Even word order may help. But the context is inscrutable. This is John Searles The Chinese Room activated. Plowing through prompts to get what you want is a mashup of the game of Clue, charades, and Magic 8 Ball.To become adept at DALLE-2 is to be one of those guys that does yo-yo tricks, and I don't have the time for that. It is a useful tool, good for generating suggestions and alternate images, some with unexpected poses and gracefully thoughtful ones at that. But I'm getting good at whipping out populated environments with my 3D render skills (See 20 minute speed sculpt and #kitbash).I using the variations on an image feature, DALLE-2 experienced edge effects, where the poor thing hit a wall.Will use again, but not reliant on it. Other things.I saw an article about Bill Shatner interviewed on his riding the Bezos penis rocket. Captain Kirk went into space october of last year. He said he experienced profound grief up there at the Karman line. Yes, beautiful blue marble below, but looking up, nothing but black. Nothing but death.Oh sure, there may be life out there. But in between our home and someone or something else's is a lot of death. So much death. (Right there is a giant piece of the  Fermi Paradox). A universe seemingly programmed to blosson with life has in turn a massive counterbalance of death. Bill Shatner experiences cosmic horror, realizing the hubris of crossing vast voids in a one hour episode. Bill Shatner did his part to get us excited about the adventure of finding new life, but it is obviously a poisonous lie, and Bill saw his part in that lie.This is our home and always will be. Maybe people will make it out to space,but death is coming for them all the time, and for several thousands cubic light years around them.

Even Putin and Xi, who are at the state-level actor end of the scale (individually they're multi-billionaires: but they also control nuclear weapons, armies, and populations in 8-9 digits) have little global leverage. Putin's catastrophic adventure in Ukraine has revealed how threadbare the emperor's suit is: all the current gassing in the Russian media about using nuclear weapons if he doesn't get his way actually does is to demonstrate the uselessness of those nuclear weapons for achieving political/diplomatic objectives.So I conclude that they probably feel about as helpless in the face of revolutions, climate change, and economic upheaval as you and I.\" - Charlie StrossStudies have shown that the rich max out in comfort level around $100 million.

Followed eventually by the sound of ambulances and fire trucks. 15 miles away from me in the affluent suburb of Highland Park, a shooter killed 6 and wounded 30 up at a 4th of July parade. Right there in the green zone. No one is safe now, was the message. Buy More Guns was the message.  ========================================================================='National pride is at stake' crows the Science article about the race to develop hypersonic weapons. From the article:For decades, the U.S. military—and its adversaries—have coveted missiles that travel at hypersonic speed, generally defined as Mach 5 or greater. Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) meet that definition when they re-enter the atmosphere from space. But because they arc along a predictable ballistic path, like a bullet, they lack the element of surprise. In contrast, hypersonic weapons such as China's waverider maneuver aerodynamically, enabling them to dodge defenses and keep an adversary guessing about the target.The worry being these hypersonic demons are unstoppable. But for a great majority of the time even the predictable ballistic path missile have been unstoppable. There have been gains in anti-missile technology to worry missileers, but certainly much cheaper alternatives to hypersonic flight exist, and one has to assume there are larger reasons to pursue it. Again from the article:Now, DOD is leading a new charge, pouring more than $1 billion annually into hypersonic research. Competition from ambitious programs in China and Russia is a key motivator. Although hype and secrecy muddy the picture, all three nations appear to have made substantial progress in overcoming key obstacles, such as protecting hypersonic craft from savage frictional heating. Russia recently unveiled a weapon called the Kinzhal, said to reach Mach 10 under its own power, and another that is boosted by a rocket to an astonishing Mach 27. China showed off a rocket-boosted hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) of its own, the Dongfeng-17, in a recent military parade. The United States, meanwhile, is testing several hypersonic weapons. \"It's a race to the Moon sort of thing,\" says Iain Boyd, an aerospace engineer at the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"National pride is at stake.\"So, simple answer, space war butthead stuff. Not to be dismissive. The tech is fascinating. The tech is finally melding and all the niches for spaceflight are starting to mature. But just to hurl nukes? No dearie dear. Why build a cathedral and use it as a battering ram? My guess is there's a lot more to the Air Force X47-B space plane program than meets the eye. Lots and lots of stuff, not to mention all the Shuttle flights. The USA plays Aw Shucks almost as often as the game of Catch Up. And guess what? It is still rocket science. One hundred years on from the Wright brothers and it is still hard stuff to do. Everybody is worried about Russia and China when they shouldn't count out Iran. Or India or Pakistan for that matter. We may be looking at Space War One (or Two?

Possibly because tiny Tom Cruise would be sky burgers after about twenty seconds against a drone. Let's face it, unlike fighter drones, Tom Cruise cannot handle sustained 9 gee acceleration and look both ways at the same time. He cannot think a million times faster than a human.Not to make too much of drones. Like hypersonic weapons, they suffer from design flaws and the biggest flaw is the machine intelligence itself. It's damn hard to audit a machine intelligence and the data it learns from. It's damn hard to know how it is doing what it is doing other than empirica evidence. This is nto a good situation. There have been numerous reports of bias introduced into these little critters (the classic example is how an AI chatbot was corrupted into a racist, sexist troll after being exposed to Twitter) and invariably the fault lies with the training data. Garbage in, garbage out.One example is to attack machine learning training by re-ordering the sequence of training data. This is because ML models are susceptible to \"initialization bias\" (paging Kahneman and Tversky). Whatever data they receive first has a profound impact on the overall weighting of subsequent data.Worse still, evidence is mounting that validating an ML model can be made impossible by planting an udectectable backdoor into the training data. Such a backdoor can change the classification of any input wihout detection by a tester - unless they are in possession of a \"backdoor key\". The mechanism is undetectable by any computationally bound observer, meaning you can't even tell if a backdoor was implanted into the model. That's pretty scary. Rather like the Manchurian Candidate, the thing itself doesn't know it is corrupted.There are plenty of examples of how poison data makes ML baby Jesus cry, but for your entertainment, read this Pluralistic entry from Cory Doctorow.

{"title": "A New History of Old Europe", "date": "Wednesday, June 22, 2022", "text": "A Short History of Humanity: A New History of Old Europe by Johannes Krause and Thomas Trappe (translated by Caroline Waight) gives us the latest info on archeology and DNA samplings from European archaeological sites. The title may be a bit pretentious, as it only covers an area of Earth more or less a cultural backwater until very recent times. Still, there is a lot of new information to give us an up-to-date picture of the peopling of Europe. European archeology covering the most ground, it is refreshing to see debunking and confirmations from new data. Particularly, and most interesting, the piecing together of prehistoric metadata involving artifacts and diseases.I enjoyed this book as it is a good tie-in with David Graeber's and David Wengrow's The Dawn of Everything.Shaman of Bad DurrembergEurope, the largest peninsula on Earth, has it tough duing the Ice Ages. Though the central plains heading across Eurasia are ice free, living conditions at the deepest parts of ice ages are impossible. However, during the interglacials Europe is quite charming. Briefly, from current data in the book, what we currently know is that Europe's first known settlers are Neanderthals and Denisovans some 600,000 years ago. Early modern humans followed, but left no permanent genetic record among modern Europeans.Three waves of anatomically modern humans have left genetic markers among Europeans today. The first wave, the hunter gatherers that produced the beautiful cave paintings at Lascaux and Altamira, entered from Africa approximately 45,000 years ago. Reconstructed DNA evidence taken from bones and teeth from that time indicate they were dark-skinned, and dark to light eyed. These Aurignacian hunters after mastodon and cave lion and short face bear were beautiful black people with blue eyes.The latest Ice Age ended some 12,900 years ago, and was so abrupt as to be noticed in the short span of one generation. Times were good for the hunter gatherers in Europe, until about 8,000 years ago, with glaciers finally in retreat, farmers from Anatolia and the Fertile Crescent appear in Europe. Interestingly, there are two distinct groups of unrelated peoples inhabiting the western and eastern portions of the Fertile Crescent. The western people are the lactose tolerant cheese eating surrender monkeys of the future. Because they lack nutrients (vitamin D) from hunter gathering, they got paler and paler the further north they went. Funny thing is the physical records show the original hunter-gatherers staying way clear of these extremely violent farmers bickering over land, other than interaction through trade. And the trade networks are a regular time crystal of a quantum computer connected by atom lasers. Much to be gleaned from the metadata of traded artifacts, but the extent of networks reached all the way across Eurasia, and possibly into the Western Hemisphere. These are the peoples behind the poorly named Agricultural Revolution, with groups picking up and abandoning agricultural practices as set their whims. (My mother's side of the family can be traced back to the Scandinavian penisula, which became ice free a mere 6,200 years ago.)5000 years ago the last migration wave arrived from the Ponticsteppes above the Caspian and Black Seas, the Yamnaya. The Yamnaya brought Indo-European languages, bronze age tech, and domesticated horses with them. They originally migrated across the Caucasus to the steppes from the Zagros mountains of Iran (thus the whole shithead Aryan white supremacy thing).This third migration wave DNA is prominant in Northern and Eastern Europe, and also in Native Americans. (Easily solved problem traced back to a 24,000 year old skeleton in Mongolia, the common ancestor). We are up to speed save for an interesting deduction via the metadata of disease. There is a suggestion that the Black Plague came with the Yamnaya, like a biocidal invasive species.. Further, plague has a possible origin in the domestication of horses. The bacteria responsible for plague are indigenenous to the Vast Plain of Eurasia. Further evidence, the Yamnaya replaced their steppe horses and tamed native European horses (possibly more resistant to plague). Obviously, the authors stress the absurdity of racial superiority and that we are still of dangerously limited genetic diversity. (Me being Scandinatian makes me seriously inbred). Thank goodness for the African Diaspora.Still lots to do, lots of books to come, and still a lot of places to dig up."},

Ammonia, used as fertilizer, is derived by the Haber Bosch process, run on oil and gas. This is not sustainable.

Danto, art critic, once declared the end of art and DALLE-2 might be it. DALLE-2 is a text to image app from OpenAI and it is astonishingly good. You put in any text and a scene is provided in return. A djinn and a wish. For example, \"Hothouse elves in a greenhouse of flowering fire plants and vines, in the style of ____\" and voila! A replicator and a holosuite rolled into one produces your scene. Your world building, your characters, and you can adjust it just by being more specific like a recursive wishaholic. Graphic and game designers, artists who know about it are either nervous or greedy to get their hands on it. I'm signed up. You can submit pic requests to OpenAI via Twitter and Instagram right now if you wish. Some consider this highly dangerous, deep fake wise, but if you cannot rely on computer number one (taps head) to sift out the bullshit, you are kind of fucked anyway. Hopefully someone will look out for you.I played with DALLE back in 2021 and am blown away at the advancement. I shouldn't be, but I am. Here's the thing, that part to me that I wanted to use was: in the style of_____I was too lazy to download and learn the software, so I relied upon service, Snowpixel. I relayed the desire that when it came to that In the Style of____ lazy Johnny wanted in the style of me. The developer replied you are about the millionth person that wants that. Artists hand a multiuniverse generating versions of their own works. A vast portfolio of John Kurman stuff for me to pick and choose and point in directions I want to go. It is a Moog synthesizer of  brain toy. Here's the funny thing, you guys ready? Samples of my art indicate I am 73 different artists. Never one to be patient, I roam the borders, forever in novelty. So of course I want to use DALLE-2.OpenAI also has a text generator called GPT-3 which can code, blog, and argue. I'm sure someone has suggested GPT-3 texting DALLE-2 and bye bye."},
{"title": "Breaking News: Elon Musk Invades Twitter", "date": "Wednesday, April 6, 2022", "text": "Musk has been buying shares of Twitter since January, amassed 9.2% of the company to become the largest shareholder. The Twitter put him on the board of directors with his promise he would not seek controlling interest. No one wants to call it a hostile takeover, but that is what it was, exactly the same to when Musk took over Tesla.Sieg Heil BabyMusk claims this is a free speech issue, but this is a red herring considering 1) under Citizen's United, money is free speech, and therefore Musk is more than free to speak; 2) his own censorious history and lame shitposting negates his claim to be a free speech absolutist, and 3) this is not a First Amendment issue. Only the mentally challenged, highly naive or cynical nihilists buy the Free Speech bullshit.Is any of this important? Could be, under certain counterfactuals. Twitter has been getting the tar beat out of it by TikTok and Snapchat. User numbers of Twitter, like Facebook, are not going in the right direction. I doubt that Musk is interested in growth so much as control, our thin-skinned petty tyrant is making Twitter how he wants it to be. I will tell you right now, Twitter jail will be expanded to a gulag.(One wonders why Donald Trump didn't try this instead of tragic attempts to get his mojo back. It oculd, aside from not being smart enough to think of it, or having smart advisers to think of it, Trump just didn't have the money to pull it off. So, he stinks of loser stench forever after, amen).If Musk is actively involved in management, we can expect similar disappointments that Tesla and SpaceX have provided. What? Scream the stans, Tesla is worth over a trillion dollars, and SpaceX disrupted the aerospace industry. But keep in mind, without stellar management and countless faceless engineers for him to Thomas Edison in front of, Musk would have neither Tesla or SpaceX. In fact, he barely managed to be part of PayPal.More and more, the comparison to Hitler's early luck and later meddling seems ready to play out. All Musk needs now is a Doktor Feelgood to shoot him up with concoctions to get him to the next meeting.Which is to say, this is more illiberal democracy, more of the totalitarian future we can all look forward to. Social media is carved up and siloed, but clearly all it takes is the next invention to fuck up the status quo. You don't need innovators or disruptors to muck about the place, things just keep on changing. Without the next big thing, it's just churning the waters with a shit stick to see what can be skimmed. Perhaps that's all this is, or perhaps Musk thinks he can, with his brain control shit, control brains. Or maybe he just wants an Edit button."},

The Apocalypse.Right now everyone is focused on a slap, but we will armchair general our way back to Ukraine, and what went wrong? Is it going wrong? Is Putin playing nine-dimensional chess? Is Xi thinking 200 years ahead? Is the US going to do what it always does? Will there be World War III? Nope. We already had that, and the Boomers won. Over the period of the Cold War, about half a gigaton of nuclear tests were done, poisoning air, water and soil. The fact that millennials and zoomers don't have two heads or flipper limbs is a testament to the robust supply chains of DNA.(Life started out as RNA world, when Earth and Sol were still part of a globular cluster chock full of ionizing radiation and blazing sister stars. I suspect DNA world didn't get started until Sol was flung free of the birth cluster, but I digress).Meanwhile we've pumped out Hiroshimas per second of CO2 and methane, heated up the oceans and air, to set up something that dwarfs the might of all the world's nuclear weapons. World War IV is upon us.And of course, we are losing. Oh sure, temporary victories, like fusion. But pulling tech out of our ass only works in movies that end with a big musical number: musicals, comedies, and musical comedies. Fusion will not decarbonize the atmosphere. Fusion will not stop the sixth extinction, even if we all cluster into monkey hives and let Mama Earth do Her thing. That ain't gonna happen. So Apocalypse it is!As I've said before most people don't have a strong enough imagination of post-apocalyptic life because they will be dead. Who is gonna die? Well, if we go with the Kurman Maxim, those least deserving of it.India was supposed to be a superpower by now. Instead, they have staggering poverty rates, 1 in 5 people. (The USA is 1 in 10 poor). Glacier loss is important, loss of ice as water storage. Less water down river for everyone. Tibet, the Himalayas, the Third Pole, is warming up and that is bad for Earth Island. Not just India but southeast Asia. Australia is getting clobbered, and will continue to get clobbered. Africa is already familiar with drought and deluge, but the loss of wildlife is astonishing. The Western hemisphere, traditionally arid, is nostalgic again. Europe? Is for Mister Toad's Wild RideIn all we are entering a period of prolonged instability between Icehouse and Hothouse.Let me explain. In college I got interested in nonlinear equations.Not being very bright I modelled stuff on the university computers. Nowadays it is called chaos theory or complexity theory. Running my FORTRAN programs, most stuff flips from one state to another and then stays the same. But sometimes there is turbulence, switching between states, and this can become a permanent thing. RE: wild wild weather from here on out. Strap in. Build your infrastructure accordingly. People get acceleration and shock, but they don't get 4th derivative and up stuff. Just this energizing of the atmosphere and the oceans gets you standing waves of static. Or..Per Kurman's Ironic Global Warming, the tropics and subtropics ain't that bad. The poles still get cold by being in seasonal shadow, so there's still a heat sink. There is still tropic to pole circulation, but not the good kind that mixes up waters and oxygenates oceans. This is the problem. Suddenly relying on fossil oxygen while the generators are shut down. Nothing so dramtic as the Great Dying of the Permian. But nothing nearly as nice as the Miocene-Eocene warmup.Quite simpy, most people are fucked. Fuck Mars. Time to think about terraforming Iceland. Or Northern Siberia.There's the rub."},

The tumor will shrink and die over the course of about a year and a half. It is hard to say what my eyesight will be like long term,but right nowit is like looking through a vascularized Sargasso Sea of tentacles and frog's eggs.Longer version. Death and shrinkage of the tumor really isn't going to start until around May or June. Seriously? I impatiently asked. And then the tumor will slowly shrink and die down to maybe a 2 millimeter vestigial upside-down mushroom maybe a year from now, year and a half. . The vision outlook is not so clear. Last visit to the fantastic retinologist it was determined I had 20/100* vision in the right eye. 20/20 in the left. (While we were about it, I asked the nurse to test my left eye without glasses and it was 20/25. That's not bad). There is going to be scarification of the macula (the face and color part of the retina), and minimizing the damage is the strategic plan. My guess is, based upon occasio0nal clear patches I see when the tumor sways, that the vision is still there. If we can keep the scarification to the tumopr stump, I just lose lower visual field. That's the hope, but I could still lose the eye.Quality of life? I've essentially lost the eye, behavior and navigation-wise. In most cases, I close my right eye to operate better. I've debated wearing an eye patch, which makes things easier. I have lost a confidence I did not know I had,an ease of bodily presence. I was no catlike graceful strutter before, but this is almost intolerable. trying to raft this big ape body around the bends and rapids of day-to-day.I'm not getting used to this shit either.

Maybe it's just too hard to do it. Maybe you don't need to because you have the vast riches of an entire solar system to breed in.(For all their smarts, humans behave like every other animal or microbe: exhausting food supply at an exponential rate like a person with no impulse control. Maybe that dooms us)Maybe FTL attempts opens portals to Hells or some other popular fiction: multiverses, dream roads, supernovae? And STL just takes too damn long or, if you can live in multigenerational ships, you no longer need worlds to colonize. Although my favored solution? Intelligence is self-destructive. Earth has had at least five great extinction events. There's no evidence of intelligent life, or at least artifactual life, of being a cause. But there's no reason not. I guess I have to find evidence, don't I?Let's pretend I'm right. Assume each extinction was caused by a self-doomed technological civilization. The Ordovician/Silurian Event, from which the popular Silurian Hypothesis theorizing past intelligent creatures on Earth before humans, was caused by the sqwuids cuttlefish and octopus and such, who built a number of bases on the inner planets and asteroids before they left Sol. Yes, they trashed Earth, just as we are doing. TV Show?  My Favorite Mollusca about a Silurian octopus monster that sounds like Jackie Mason.The Devonian Event, war of the fish peoples. Sponge Bob. Still some Squidwards hanging around.The Permian Event, war of the lizard peoples. Although honestly, no. The Earth is a dangerous planet, as the dyings of Permian/Triassic/Jurassic show in stone. Can't really make a justification for lizard people.The K-T Event, war of the bird people. Fed up, one side let loose a fist of god and clobbered our future Yucatan. Bird people might still be around. Bird people discovered the silurian squid bases on the Moon &c and modified them enough that even astronauts could open them. That's what happened.Ok, here's another movie idea, John Carpenter's sequel to The Thing. Global warming has thawed out both the Thing at the South Pole and the Blob at the North Pole. Now you might ask, wasn't Santa supposed to be looking out after the Blob? Is that asking too much from that jolly old elf? Well, we are going to find out in The Blob vs The Thing. The Blob is a slime-mold metaphor of us, you and me, yes, we are the Blob. When it comes to consciousness, the connectionists appear to win. The Blob will take over the Northern hemisphere rapidly. Meanwhile, in Antarctica the Thing has thawed out. My pitch to John Carpenter is Kurt Russell is a Thing, but knows he is a Thing and is pissed off he's a Thing and wants to fight the Thing. This conflict is interrupted when the government types show up (ala Escape from New York) to tell Thing Kurt Russell about the Blob. Thng Kurt Russell and the Thing agree to exterminate the Blob but it means most people will have to become Things. Damn I wish Donald Pleasance were still alive, but with these cheap reverse engineered mini brains called AI, we have deep fakes for all that.How do we get Kurt Russell to win against The Blob and The Thing? By sacrificing himself duh! No sequel. Only prequels. Which, since people understand What If is now, is: plenty o stories."},

{"title": "Can Del Close Save META?", "date": "Saturday, February 26, 2022", "text": "In 1973 I went on a high school field trip to Second City, the sketch comedy club in Chicago. I got to watch - without knowing it - John Candy and Bill Murray on stage. I also remember this weird guy with glasses at one of the tables, chain smoking and laughing loudly. He often distracted the audience enough to fluster the players. Only later did I realize he was Del Close.Del Close helped figure out long form improvisation, and it is my opinion that art form will be the only savior of META and the VR universe. Let me unpack that. VR has been around forever, but only lately have the 1980s fictions like Ready Player One become closer to reality. MPORG games have been around forever and it was assumed that VR would just be 3D glasses. But get past the avatars and the goofy chaos of youtube hooligans, and people have been social on it. Not mass event social but small theater social.What is not realized is there are things that must be shared events, public events, and VR doesn't do it. Not when you can do it IRL. Dinner theater and one ring circus would seem to be VR outlets. But nothing unstructured and liberating. Instead the artficial joy of pixels and voxels and a Disney Ride. The only improvement to VR action will be hamster balls*, but creative play? Not on Zuck's lawn. Enter improv. Del Close, paraphrased, said \"conflict is boring. I'd rather say 'Yes, and' instead of  'No\".Del Close came up with a generative method of long form improv called The Harold. The Harold was later improved to produce long form experiences of 10-45 minutes. The successful performance (allowing participants more time to develop believable characters and storylines) involved initial suggestions, followed by vignettes, followed by a group game using the vignettes, iterate until it goes bust or something magical happens. Good participants witness a logical structure develop from a premise, a set of equations today now known as Chaos Theory or nonlinear models.Long form improv has advanced beyond actor warmups and parlor games, but what's wong with those? Aa parlor game can be either premise-based or organic play, can be expanded into a community, a consensual reality, and then you get the gestalt effect. If you've ever played in a garage band and improvised, you get the idea. Out of all that awful dirt appear nuggets of gold. You use those nuggets to make less dirt and more nuggets, before you know it you have a world built and a personal mythology to follow. And you will note that those instances or trances occur when the band was the Band, hive mind achieved.How does this work for VR experiences? People improvise anyway, right? Anyone who has watched Youtube videos of VRChat understand too much improvisation is annoying, not at all freeing or creative as a social place to go. My suggestion is the people don't follow The Harold, the bots do.Consider: the internet is increasingly being writen by bots. Probably 99% of internet content will be AI-generated. Online worlds and all the stuff that inhabits them, with humans in a tiny minority. How will it be fun and useful for us humans? My answer, hard-wire the spirit of fun and play into the bots. How do you have fun? You feel safe. How are you able to play? It's safe to play. The Yes-And logic of The Harold, that conflict is boring, could possibly make META safe and interesting. Although honestly, VR, like block chain, is a solution looking for a problem.Other things. I got done with my radation treatment. The proton beam really anatoginized the tumor, however, I am noticing an improvment in vision as the inflammation subsides.I got a ceremony at the end of treatment. I rang a bell and got a challenge coin. I don't consider my role in this as military veteran, as the rituals and tone would suggest, still I acted the part. I am honored by the network of care.I thought about being an actor, still could. The limiting factor in my case is probably talent. Too inappropriate reactions because duh autistic dork flinch."},

Eeemian also known as the Ipswichian, the Sangamonian, Valdiva, Riss-Würm, all referencing European digs. Unfortunately, none of those digs are important save to give insight into Neandertal lifestyles. Homo sapiens - anatomically modern Homo sapiens, is still mostly in Africa and perhaps some parts of the Middle East. This is, of course, based upon current dug up evidence, mostly in Morocco. As you can see from the map, still plenty of places to dig up. Let's be clear here though, skeletons anatomically modern go to back to 230,000 years. That doesn't mean they were us. But there were at least 10 other hominid contemporary (I hesitate to use the term Archaic not having met them), people wandering around as well. People today look nothing like back then. We couldn't because we are a mix of them, now. Going from folklore, you'd guess it was all fairy tale land, JRR Tolkein stuff, Middle Earth with trolls and goblins and elves. And why not? All fucking and fighting my friend. People don't get that they were still and all, people. Hell, for all we know it was Conan the Barbarian back then, with a leather and wood version of sword and sorcery.Northern Africa with USA as size referenceWas there a civilization anything like what we call our modern predicament? The answer is probably no. From the previous essay:The Eeemian shows up in the ice cores mentioned above and there is no evidence of nuclear atmospheric tests, plastics, petroleum or metallurgy. So, no modern things. Corresponding artifacts in stone and bone tell the same story of stone age glory. Homo sapiens is confined to Africa, perhaps some forays, but otherwise, not in Eurasia, and more important, not in the Western Hemisphere. The Eemian is almost smack dab in the middle of  the Middle Stone Age (300,000-30,000BCE) and the artifacts are flaked stone tools from factory cores, bone tools as well. Around 150,000 years ago there appears a bone tool for sewing. If there is sewing there is tanning, tent making, ropes, salt collecting, a large number of fiber industries, all supplemented by trade networks throughout Africa, and thus social networks, cultural bases and offsets (customs) in some cases universal. ( ex: Shells, drilled, uniform, everywhere far from the source. The same thing happened in the Holocene).There are faitly accurate climate and terrain descriptions (based on ice and dust and pollen counts taken from drilled lakebed cores). For a few kiloyears in the middle of the interglacial, it is a hotter, mositer world than we experience.The Sahara and Arabian peninsula are green. A Green Hell, if there are hippos in Engand. Mostly savanna but also forests and swampland, with extensive north-south river systems in modern day Libya and Algeria and megalakes in Chad. It was much the same as it was some 5-6000 years ago when the Sahara was last green, but 2-3C warmer. There is today a vast fresh water aquifer underneath much of Libya and Algeria (fortunately untapped), from this green period.There was a trans-Saharan corridor running from the Atlantic to the Persian Gulf (Green Sahara and Arabia), and corridors leading to Southern Africa. In terms of animals, we know hippos and elephants were lviing in England some 130,000 years ago, so think heat tolerant tropical and subtropical fauna, incredibly rich, diverse and dense in varitety and population. Paradise.Sea level is 20-30 feet higher than today, notably due to melting of large parts of Greenland and the complete collapse of the West Antrarctic ice sheet. The isthmus, where the Suez canal runs today, was mostly inundated but not impossible to traverse. Migration routes were open to the Saudi peninsula and north along the Mediterranean coast.Which means migration into Eurasia was possible both ways, although no Nearnderthal remains are found in Africa, so far. Again the question of if \"we\" made it to Australia or the Western Hemisphere. So far, no."},

I'd intentionally not read reviews of the book to color my own observations. Do a google search . Most reviews are glowing. Others vehemently against. It's pretty much a  left/right split on like/dislike. The liberal bastions the Atlantic and New York Times, were glowing. Wall Street Journal, various scholars, not so glowing. Those were the criticisms I was interested in. I should note that when Graeber first published Debt: The First 5000 Years, he discussed the book on Crooked Timber. Some criticisms were vehement, almost violent, and those tended to peck at the eyes, the obvious errors in fact or opinion, rather than knocking down the general logic of the book. Graeber held his own, but admitted there were errors. There are always errors .They should not be constured as straw man or cherry picking or argument from ignorance.. Having taught a class in logic and criticism, I gave him 8 for 2. Not bad. Crroked Timber also discussed TDOE and it was a funeral.The Dawn Of Everything Gets Human History Wrong by Chris Knight, Nanacy Lindisfarne, and Jonathon Neale. Maybe it's my lack of reading comprehension but they totally agree with everything they object to. They call the Ds Often Wrong, then proceed to give the same fucking answer they object to. WTF, could be I skimmed the book too fast or I came to the wrong conclusions, the critics were arguing the same page. Are there errors in TDOE? I'm sure but I have to work through the notes.Big Data has hit archaeology. It's no genie, more of a AI crow to find shiny, but the Big Data approach gave generalist expeditions into specialist data and observations. Couple this software octopus with increasingly intensive (private collections & museums digitally documented) and extensive (dense hi-tech field work) observations, incredible documentation tech, sampling to produce petabytes of insights about our world and us. It is now possible to visualize the world other than our own imagination to AR-include metadata of artifacts, real time referencing to all libraries and collections. AIs hungry for cut marks, ochre, intentional grinding  The Silver Age of Archaeology won't stop at the Golden Age, but further on. (especially if we pursue underwater archaeology to examine Ice Age shores and rivers now 200 feet below sea level. That's the goodies me bucko*)A good example of technologically enhanced humanity is recent efforts to correlate volcanic eruptions to historic events. From the article:Less than a decade ago, scientific calculations of the dates of volcanic eruptions used only 16 measurements per ice core to cover 2,000 years of history and included as much as two-century margins of error, too imprecise to be of use to historians. Instruments invented at the Desert Research Center in Reno now take 21,000 measurements per ice core and can detect at least 30 elements down to parts per quadrillion⁠. This data improves on the old estimates by two orders of magnitude, enabling historians to make exact correlations with documented historical events.History traditionally plays out on a wooden stage when obviously it's the deck of a heaving ship.Survival of the fittest for that environment. Not a fitness landscape, a ship on a fitness seascape. And as sea monkeys grow into sea apes, the number and weight of the arks and fleets effects the ocean itself.  This is a familiar nonlinear model that descends into infinity fairly quickly. A difficult but not impossible field equation to solve.   That is where move from superorganism to eukaryote to what? A person? A singular monster?. Aren't that scale invariant? And if so, are we, as far as we know, an intelligent species that can do much cooler things than bees and ants? Or can we? The Solar System tamed and named, is that a triumph? I don't know. Intelligence increasingly looks self- destructive.We could check. We got records. The Eemian, for starters, the last interglacial starting about 123,000 years ago. Lasted about around 14,000 years. Ironically we avoided the next Ice Age with our modern smoke, but Hot House Earth is not good for ice apes baby.The Eeemian shows up in the ice cores mentioned above and there is no evidence of nuclear atmospheric tests, plastics, petroleum or metallurgy. So, no modern things. Corresponding artifacts in stone and bone tell the same story of stone age glory. Homo sapiens is confined to Africa, perhaps some forays, but otherwise, not in Eurasia, and more important, not in the Western Hemisphere. What's going on Eemian-wise? I don't know.

{"title": "The Dawn of Everything by David Graeber and David Wengrow", "date": "Tuesday, January 4, 2022", "text": "It is a tragedy that there will not be three or four sequels to this book, as planned. Genius is tossed about too casually, but David Graeber definitely was a genius. I'm gonna have to buy this book as the limit of the library loan made me skim a lot (never enjoyable). I like to read and then walk and sleep on it. This is a book worth rereading. The main point of the book is its time to reexamine our data, check our bias, see what is probably correct or absurdly wrong. Much of the prehistoric narrative, and the advancement of civilization, is mostly wrong. We have a prejudice, a bigotry, towards primitive man which has made us mostly wrong about the past. We have a paucity of imagination on purpose, to be scientific. But that makes us objectively wrong.Picture yourself  15,000 years ago. Or I will. I'll look mighty peculiar. White people have not been invented yet. Oh sure, still another 8000 years and latitude and dietary changes to get the combo of light complected skin, eyes, hair. I am also frail and gracile compared to the short robust people of this time. Any one of these prehistoric people could break me in half. Mostly foragers, some play gardens towards occasional flood zone agriculture. They are incredibly fit and well fed, and also smarter than me, in a generalist way. Half a million years of cooking had shrunk their jaws almost as much as mine, but I had been selected for, among other things, vocal production. Language being a big bang for the buck communication;my short face, long neck, and descent of larynx has given my voice an operatic style of timbre, articulation, and perhaps range. This does not mean someone 15,000 years ago couldn't talk. Of course they could. Stuck in the popular mind are grunting and hooting cartoons. 100,000 years ago, yes, humans were not capable of the full range of human speech, but I think it ridiculous to assume they did not talk, or that language itself accelerated our cultural development. Articulate people, also playful, creative, imaginative, curious, cautious, and almost always in charge. They are not cowering in caves warding off animals with torches, but out and about in the world.And what a world! Not the impoverished ecosystems of 21st century Earth, but teeming with an embarassment of overflowing life, lush with plants and animals. Rivers covered in fish. Oceans, plains, forests teaming with game, A landscape already fire shaped by human technology for human desire. Their entire necessary technology, the world's tools, on or about their person, and easy access to more.How easy? By making, but more often trading. The trades extend throughout Eurasia and Africa going back at least 60,000-75,000 years. Extensive trade based upon so many objects far from their origins. Evidence also of not just making, but industrial mass production. A whole variety of things from arrowheads to mammoth ivory beads, to wood and bone and leather and rope. Beautiful things spectacular in their individual styles, yet still efficiently mass produced. The people back then, the myth goes, were much more free - free to work and play - than we are today. So, what went wrong? The idea is somehow we got stuck society-wise in this heirarchy, kind of like a bunch of bacteria locked in as symbiotes to a larger eukaryotic cell. The state? Let's not get ahead of ourselves.The Ds, Davids, Graeber and Wengrow have written a critque of the current narrative we have about prehistoric and near historic peoples,which I will get into, but they base much of their critique on what they call primordial freedoms:Freedom to leave.Freedom to disobey.Freedom to play (at social experiments).I think there is one more primordial freedom, which is:Freedom to get fucked up, intoxicated, psychedelic, &c.The Ds work from archaeological finds - the most recent 30 years - which are just now yielding vast amounts of information about how we past peoples lived. The archaeological evidence suggests the modern interpretation of prehistory, via people like Jared Diamond, Steven Pinker and Francis Fukuyama, are by and large just-so stories. This is not a put down of the above authors. Evidence changes, old museum artifacts identified correctly, new digs with contemporary technique, a clearer picture of prehistoric us. There is also recognized cutltural bias - despite cold reasoned deductive techniques - causing Victorian biologists to name a bug a queen bee. Not Egglayer. Not Old Means of Production. Queen. Or depicting Neanderthals as shambling ape men.Starting with Rousseau and proceeding through the Enlightenment, the Ds say anthropological narrative mimics the stale story of the Bible. Starting in a egalitarian savage state and \"racing for our chains\" (Rousseau) via the agricultural revolution, property rights, and heirarchy. (The Ds make a good case that most of our American ideas about democracy were actually critiques and arguments from Eastern Woodland philosophers, towards Jesuits. There was certainly no tradition of democracy in Europe to compare to the radical ideas of the primordial freedoms).The contemporary narrative of progresss is us moving from clans to tribes to chiefdoms to states. Each level an increase in population size, better lifestyle and accumulation of wealth. The evidence suggests otherwise. People did just fine as foragers. People did just fine without bosses. People built cities without bosses. Didn't need agriculture to sustain these cities. Most cities started out as mudpie play and added to over the centuries. They were built, abandoned, refurbished, demolished, like childrens treehouses. Again, a reminder that prehistoric us was just as imaginative, clever, and playful as we are now. Probably more. In any case, these European blinkers on paleontology produced some whoppers of judgements.Example: The Great Leap, a cultural leap 40,000 years ago, based on increased sophistication of artifacts. Judgement: False positive, with bias. Western archeological research had been mainly digging up stuff in Europe. Unfortunately this priming error has promoted Western chauvinism (white supremacy). More to the point, the European invasion and slaughter of the inhabitants of Turtle Island (as N. America was indigenously known) was inevitable, almost manifest destiny. Diamond, Pinker etc. are quick to point out the external advantages, the guns, germs and steel, as opposed to any inate superiority of the invasive species, nevertheless they treat it as fate. Where instead is coincidence, and a small window of coincidence at that. Back to primordial truths. Freedom to leave. Freedom to disobey. Freedom to play. How are these supported in the archaeological record? Well, take prehistoric cities, like in the Anatolian highlands, the Indus valley, the Ukrainian mammoth bone villages, have no palaces, no physical signs of income inequality. More like suburban tracts of similar houses, cells in a beehive, all grown over centuries of playing around at building. Gobeckli Tepe, Kaharantepe, assumed to be temples, feel more like amusement parks, haunted houses. Built on some agreed upon plan with no central planners, or at least no permanent bosses. What you might call nowadays a DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, but with some seasonality. As if, for a period of mutual improvement and fun, all volunteered for corvee labor, and then went on their merry way to do whatever TF they wanted until the next season or get-together.So what you generally find, is that people do just fine without bosses. Bosses are nowadays a complex mixture of sovereignty, charismatic politics, and bureaucracy. Mini-states.Mini-mansions.A big just-so story is once you get too many people together, you need a heirarchy of bosses to run them all. Turns out humans have been capable of mass industrial production with standardization of parts for at least 100,000 years, and with no evidence of heirarchy or dominance. Just the opposite. Often you would find the most elaborate paleolithic grave sights thought to be princes and princesses, were more often bone deformed in some way. Differently abled, cared for, cherished, dying in a society that allowed for charity.Two questions that are determined to be stupid questions are: \"When and how did inequality arise? \"When and how did the state evolve?\" One opinion they demolish is state as a monopoly of violence. Capitalism (for one) is based upon force and fraud. How that can be monopolized is a simplleton's understanding of scales of force and fraud. Better still, a Newtonian understanding of violence versus a Bose-Einstein understanding.The Ds have tons of examples, but nothing was tied together to see if the question was stupid or poorly framed. They admit that their question is how did we get stuck? That's a better question, and I think that is what the next book would have been about. It's a rushed answer they give, but I've part of the answer. It involves my 4th primordial freedom: freedom to get fucked up. In every example of every state they reviewed, all the orgs had control over intoxicants, had a purity code and efficiently mass produced industrial drug system. Note to self: every state ever controlled their drugs. Standardized and regulated good drugs to the people. Mesopotamian barley beer, Egypt had wheat beer, Incas corn beer, and along with/before that the pscyhoactive drugs and any shit you can eat, drink or smoke. 15,000 years ago, people went to megalithic sites to party and get fucked up and fool around. Get freely fucked up and see a show. And what better way to get fucked up than with well regulated drugs? Well distributed drugs? Heirarchy is the best supply chain and before you know it, you're stuck.I would argue that drug use, many other practices, is protected under the 2nd amendment. And that, dearie dears, being necessary to the security of the state, shall not be infringed.Short version? Read the book. Worth reading. Read 1491 along with it.Oh yeah, what about agriculture and property rights? The so-called Agricultural Revoltion was a 10,000 year span of opportunistic gardening, only adopted permanently after an impoverishment of the land. We stupid apes are worse than fire ants.Property rights? Ridiculous at face value, that a tiny lifespan/spaced bug like you can own a piece of 4.5 billion year old Earth. OK firefly. Neverthless, obviously a perversion of sacred body space I guess. A persversion of what you consider sacred."},

He is going to attach the tantulum clips in my sclera that will be used to triangulate the proton beam. At one point Dr. Garcia puts a bright light contraption on his forehead and said \"This is going to be uncomfortable  Let me know if this gets to be too much\". He proceeds to attack my eye socket with fingers and a pen, blinding me with the macro go-pro and an inch face to face. I go into shut down mode and it got pretty uncomfortable. I wasn't about to admit it.After consulting Dr. Kim, my opthamologist, Dr. G showed me a picture of the tumor tugging on the retina. \"I'd like to laser that down a bit, take some stress off that retina. Dr, Kim agrees. You'll retain more of your sight\". \"Go for it\" I replied. \"When?\" \"Noon tomorrow\"I was at the laser office the next day. Short story long, the reception room is packed, everyone wearing masks, sure, but at this point I guess we've all given in to endemic. Honestly I may just keep wearing the mask just to piss people off.. and because it's winter and masks better than scarf.The nurse drops the dilator drug in my right eye.

None to be seen.The laser was a 1970s stereo amplifier box with a cable and pen laser attached.The nurse puts in more numbing eye drops and then Dr. Garcia appears with a needle. The needle in my eye.You know how when you help an animal stuck in barbwire or something and you're hurting it more to free it and instead of fighting and biting the shit out of you, it freezes? Yeah, I froze.The actual discomfort was kind of touching. It was my heroic right eye, which until now, working around a tumor that kept my sight at 20/40, cried out to me in dismay at this strange pressure and just a slight pain. Meanwhile I had put myself into a strange calm.As Dr. G lasered the shit out of my tumor, I just stared a thousand miles ahead and I'll bet my pulse rate never got above 64.They put a patch on my eye and sent me home. Well, I think they just pissed the tumor off. I can't see anything out of my right eye now. Starting to clear just a bit tonight, but still like the bottom of a frog pond. I guess I'm looking out through cooked flesh."},

Why would they want your shitty lives?Let's take a break from tumor talk.I'm on page 234 of The Dawn of Everything by David Graeber and David Wenslow. Graeber died in 2020 and this is a great loss as the duo had planned 3 sequels to this book. Graeber, Mr. 99% of Occupy Wall Street, was the Einstein anthropology needed. Writer of Bullshit Jobs and the magisterial Debt: the first 5,000 years, his insights are provocative and probably correct. What's my takeaway so far? We really need to study slavery and property rights in depth and from a great height. If you look at us as ape-shaped bugs, property is a spindling and folding of things as sacred things.Sacred leading to rights; life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Unlike the three expanisve rights listed, property is the only restrictive right.  Me. Mine. Not ours. The talk of a tumor.If you think property rights are a human right, you are probably conservative. If you beleve property rights supercede others, you are a sociopath. You probably think that humans can be property, commodified, financialized. Which gets us to slavery.Slavery a perversion of intimacy and care. After a while you get an uneasy feeling of social parasitism run rampant. Chattel slavery is actually quite profitable, as note our current global economy. Slavery by descent, beleive it or not, not as profitable. Better to kidnap and human traffic after someone else has done all the nurturing. It's all gravy that way. The only purpose of breeding chattel slaves is if you think you can improve them. The racehorse theory. Which gets us to the commmodification of the vagina.Women are cannons that shoot out babies that can become warriors or cannons. And once you look at it that way, you are a conservative.And if you think forced pregancy is slavery, you are a liberal.Which gets us to our current Abortion Wars. The interesting thing about Roe V Wade and the states is it finally gives a civil war solid geographic boundaries. The Coasts against Flyover Country, with intense ultra-blue dots throughout the Heartland. Set piece battle line sdrawn. Id you are an idiot. Or Steve Bannon.

My right eye is trying to kill me.  My right eye has gone all selfish and right wing and wants to kill me.Put another way, be careful what you joke about. The universe always provides a punchline. I joked as to how my 7th decade was going to kill me, and the punchline is cancer.in the picture above, the top row shows the choroidal melanoma about 11mm in diameter, a pea sized horrid little thing looking out for only itself.

Why am I worried about accomplishing something that will soon be eaten by the vast wastes of the future?There is the possiblity of me melding into an archetype at least. Think about it. I have a model of you in my mind, more detailed with exposure. Likewise you have me in your head. We metaphorically put pieces of brains in each other, which makes all of us individuals a mosaic anyway. An isolated human, cut off from the monkey hive, quickly ceases to exist.

I can't find any other charts to cerify this so let's assume its accurate but not precise early on, with more precision since record keeping. Archaeologists are now finding stuff (see The Dawn Of Everything) from early on. What's going on around 300-250BCE? If that isn't an artifact, it sure looks like we were going exponential and then got whacked. We got back to exponential 2000 years later but there was a slow down. What was it?I'm going to say the Axial Age slowed us down. The deverlopment of unviersal coinage and universal religion. Although the Axial Age was supposed to be starting around 600BCE, this could be the conseqence. There was no catastrophe or social upheaval. The age of coin and lack of credit had finally stopped up the pipes..

{"title": "Are You Of The Body?", "date": "Saturday, November 6, 2021", "text": "Blair Fix gets me. The topics he writes about I have been thinking about for a decade. Thank goodness he is a lot more patient writer than I am.Take this essay. I'm pulling up a chart in it, labelled figure 4.Let's unpack this chart. The curves shown are total income for the years 1970(red) and 2007(blue), when income inequality was respectively at a minimum and a maximum. You will notice the horizontal axis is measured logrithmically in powers of ten, simply so that the very rich can be included. A linear measured axis would have the richest way, way, way off the chart to the extreme right. The chart also uses a median income rather than average income as an average income would be heavily skewed to the right, again due to a relatively few but extremely wealthy individuals. The vertcal axis measures relative density of the US population, such that the entire curve adds up to 1. In other words, if I select an individual and their income at random, the vertical number represents their share of same income individuals within the general population. (How common that individual is).Note that on the left hand side, there is a cohort which barely existed in 1970 termed creeping poverty. Working poor who are earning less than 1% of the median income. This cohort fortunatetly is small compared to the rest of the population, and can only be explained by the elimination of the safety net and the erosion of social welfare programs from Q2 1972 onwards. On the right, extreme wealth, we have another cohort that did not exist in 1970 enjoying incomes in the millions or billions compared to your average thousandaire. The individuals themselves could not possibly earn such amounts on their own and so we have a case where their monies make more monies than they do. It feels like, if you are not thinking of humanity as a superporganism, a superhive, or a network of monkey hives, then you are wasting your time for explanation as to how and why things are. This is all really simple animal spirit. Emergent behavior and score a big one for the connectionists.If I may, Kurrman's Scale Invariant Behavior. Example: when you get into a car or truck, you cease being a pedestrian monkey and turn into a large lumbering kind of dumb big animal. Membership in organization also augments as surely as bionic limbs would, but at a cost of similar numbers displaying similar behaviors. Humans are composed of trillions of cells, the brain itself some 86 billion neurons. Ants and bees comprise quadrillions of individuals on Earth. I doubt that neurons or insects are all that aware of the collective being they comprise. Not all humans do but they are much more aware of the augmentation of being a larger thing. Funny thing is how that collective behavior by supposedly intelligent and perceptive individuals is not all that different from smaller collectives. Curious, mysterious things, large or small, but things nonetheless. As organizations get bigger, they look similar to smaller analogs, as if there were isotopes of hives. Self-similar. Fractal.Consider, in this essay we talked about humanity collectively as things, mechas, monsters, kaiju. And I would argue that mechagodzillas always end up with some despotic pea brain at the helm. Oh, brilliant, sure, but now bound to being a kaiju as best she or he can. Still just a little bug in the pilot seat. The formula used by Blair Fix is dimensions (in this case height) scale to the cube root of the mass. Take the cube root of (number of employees) times average height of a human in metric gets you your Godzilla sized thing.The US Federal government is about 5 million strong, which, do the formula, cube root of 5 million is about 170. Average human is 1.65 meters, so 280 meters tall, or about 3/4 the size of the Empire State building. The analogy though doesn.t really apply all that well. Facebook, now Meta, with about 60,000 employees would be a mere 44 meters tall. a 145 foot tall mecha. Impressive but still, Facebook is worth one trillion dollars.A better metric might be net worth of an organization, measured against median household net worth (to normalize and fit the extremely rich and powerful within the presentation of this silly exercise). Median household net work is currently around $128,000. One trillion divided by 128 thousand is 7,812,500. Using the cube root formula with one individual defined as a household gives us a creature 192 meters tall. That sounds more like it. Picture Mark Zuckerberg piloting a 624 foot tall mechagodzilla. Sounds about right.The US federal government, with a net worth of around 128 trillion ends up being a 827 meter tall mechagodzilla. 2,687 feet tall and that sounds about right. Question, could all the corporate kaiju dogpile on the US of A federal kaiju? Why yes. Yes, they could, like rats on a monkey. But you forget the states and municipalities, which, as a union, has a shit ton more money than the US government. Regardless, this is all who would win Herman Munster or the Wolfman?Let's go the other way. Take the USA, where each individual is a cell in a body. How big and sophisicated is this multicellular whole? The body? 330 million cells is like a silverfish or a cockroach. I'm guessing maybe 700-800,000 people are the brain of this cockroach, so the 5,000,000 cell brain is larger than it needs to be.If you look at the behavior of the USA from 1789 on, it looks like a cockroach. A scuttling bug among other scuttling bugs. Or fish. Or big ass metazoans. Point being, As Above So Below, with exceptions.Anyway, Blair Fix is an enemy of neo-liberalism. The enemy of my enemy is not my friend. But he's not my enemy."},

I told the eye doctor about it and he said the vitreous humor, the gel inside your eyeball, can thicken in parts. It often happens right next to the retina and can detach it in the worst case. He told me to watch for flashing or shimmering and colors. Those were warning signs. The flashing and colors came and went away last summer, replaced by a giant jelly covering 2/3rds of my lower vision and warps and distorts the upper third To add to my pleasure, a bunch of capillaries decided to die in the right eye.Closing my left eye is a nightmare of perception.

Smaller cohorts of humans are also super-organisms as well, with their own pecutliarities and talents.As an illustration, Blair Fix, in his essay The Evolution of 'Big': How Sociality Made Life Larger, estimates that the US Federal government is 10,000 times bigger than a blue whale.\"Were this mass packed into one animal, the beast would be three quarters the height of the Empire State Buidling\".I assume he equates employee count to pounds.

There is no such thing as a beta test for time machines. They either work, or work wierd. And weird may be great for a TV show. Not so great when you are lost in a swirling maze of past and future ages.Before Irwin Allen became the Master of Disaster with the Poseidon Adventure and the Towering Inferno, he did cheesy scifi TV. Land of the Giants, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Lost in Space, and The Time Tunnel. The shows didn't usually start out cheesy and frantic, but TV ratings of the 1960s demanded increasing titillation. Irwin Allen was up against Batman, so race to the bottom. Couple of things that thrilled me as a boy: sparking explosions and scene shake. Irwin Allen was addicted to shaking cameras and rattling hammers in buckets.It's an unfortunate cheap practical effect still in use. Sparks? Irwin Allen did not know what a fuse was. The advantage of the Time Tunnel was Allen had access to 20th Century Fox film and TV footage, props stock and sets making historical scenes going back to 1,000,000BCE available for free. Still, it was one of the most expensive TV shows for 1966. When ABC told Allen to cut the budget, he refused and the show was cancelled after one season. I'm betting Irwin Allen made some serious coin here.TVTropes is the best. There are other fan sites, but TVtrope cuts through the bullshit and gives you the insights. Best to read before continuing. I'll wait.Two things from TVtropes I think are important. The only lady scientist, Dr. Ann MacGregor, is Smurfette, who I guess is making sandwiches for the boys. She's always being carrried out of harm's way the second shit hits the fan. Playted by Lee Meriwether She was 31 at the time of filming which made her a Handsome Woman, in other words a Living Prop.Then there is Technician Jerry, played by Sam Groom. Jerry was offering ideas that the officers and scientistts rejected. Only to have them work in the end as a last desperate measure. So all the eggheads and authorities should have listened to Jerry. Why, Jerry had his life saved by Ann. He had a heart attack and Ann revived him with the severed ends of a power cable to restart his heart. I'm guessing some ninja reverse judo resistance fighting against the white patriarchy, a little class warfare. But you how it goes baby. We are a super organism like ants and bees. We have castes, a 40,000 year old adaptation. Castes as strictly defined as electron orbits.My 2021 reimagining of the Time Tunnel  is a superposition of events and outcomes. Most of the stories are episodic, but the theme would circle back to Billy Pilgrim is Unstuck in Time meets The Ann and Jerry anchor team time machine.In the 1960s, PROJECT TIC TOC is the US wormhole project. (Because wormhole=time machine).A visiting Senator to the site is not pleased wih all the wasted taxpayer dollars. He demands a show or the carnival gets sold. Scientist James Darren (played by Kiki LaRue) steps up to the plate and is POOF GONE for all we know vaporized. But no, the Time Tumnel, she worked and they can see them backwards in time in chronoscopic bolzetron! So, they try to get them back but no go. A tether approach might work and Guy goes into the wormhole aperture with a rope like Poltergeist. And now they are swirling in a maze of past and future ages.Episode 1,  an hour long unavoidable disaster. At the end of the first episode the universe and everyone dies. Episode 2,  an hour long unavoidable disaster. Same as the first episode, but its a time loop. Episode 3, Kiki and Guy end up on the Titanic and find some socialites with really good cocaine and booze and weed and opiates. They get really fucked up and then the iceberg hits. They get on a lifeboat and are picked up the next day by a tramp steamer.Episode 4,Kiki and Guy end up at Pearl Harbor on the Arizona Sunday morning December 7th. \"We gotta get the fuck out of here,pronto!\" They do,You can see the pattern, They're party ghosts, as well they should be.Episode 30, Kiki and Guy are augmented in the future and sent back to kill themselves by the ape shaped ant-wasps of  Year One Million. Whic they do. Season Two is augmented Kiki and Guy Show. You gotta wonder why so few episodes are about the future and that is the same problem as the Fermi Paradox."},
{"title": "100 ton racks and the Cloud above the clouds", "date": "Wednesday, September 15, 2021", "text": "Elon Musk may not be as dumb as he looks. Over at Antipope, Charlie Stross argues that Elon Musk is going to build space based solar power generators. The satellites are in geosynchronous orbit, exposed to sunlight 24/7, and we are much better at broadcasting and collecting microwaves than when this was first seriously proposed. Starship has yet to do anything like orbit and return. Still on paper, it can launch 100 tons in orbit and return, 250 tons expendable. (250 tons is half the weight of the ISS). Other than canned ape there is really no call to put 100 tons in orbit for most anybody outside the military.Still, 100 tons at geosync with current solar cells gets you on the high end of 2GW. Stross figures a 70% loss to the rectenna on Earth, gets you a 6 megawatt power plant.That does not put much of a dent in the global appetite of 18TW per hour.If  Musk comes even close to his goal of 1000 Starships launching every day, then after a year he has around 3 million tons in orbit after a year. 300,000 geosynchronous power satellites. 70% of 300,000 times 2 GW is 420TW. That is an insane amount of power.Of course its all bullshit. What if Musk doesn't give a crap about power transmission and is instead interested in information? It's easier to compute above the clouds than broadcast power. What if Mush is building a 44,000-mile sized Matrioshka Brain? Granted you got big problems with cosmic rays and solar flares. Still, lots of people are seriously thinking about putting racks in space. And why not? If losses prove acceptable, 50 tons of data center powered by 2GW in geosynchronous orbit, talking to its others in orbit?And since we've already established this all pie in the sky bullshit, cold edge computing. Literally cold in the shadow of field of solar panels. Cold plasmas, cold Bose-Einstein condesatesm time crystals, you name it. It takes a lot power for all global IT stuff, like 10% of the world's electricity. I figure a much higher profit can be made at less cost by sending all that stuff into orbit.Signed, George Jetson"},

Well, this whole memory hut should have something in it for a story or two. Here's a story not from the hut:Some years ago there was a couple on my walking route. She was stack-and-that's-a-fact bleached bonde. He was a bodybuilder type. She would be skimpily dress and doing provacative lawncare. He would scowl and brandish his muscles.I figured that was their thrill. Or they were a Venus Flytrap with a basement full of gimps.

Protoplasm. 4 billion years tested nanotech. So, I would set up a corporation that would pay people to remember shit, and pay them well. Since most humans have a pretty good memory, most people can do a primary and several secondary expertises or memorizations.I say this after reading (online) that the Encyclopedia of Human Survival is mostly online. Sorry foks,  but electricity is almost always the first to go. If I got specialists and facilitators, I'm so much beter off than being surrounded by people who look at phones. If you think about it, Steve Jobs laid an egg in all our throats with those evil things.I would also lobby Congress to pass the Extended Family Act and set up craft guilds to remember shit through the extended families, on the assumption that someone in the extended family will have an interest and the restr of the family can fuck off. The idea is borrowed from Kurt Vonnegut's C minus novel Slapstick. It had the one good idea of the government issue middle name, and the program was titled Lonesome No More!

The Dread Majesty is budling up his fiefdom before the rest of the Outer Gods arrive. (The Chtulhu Obviously, already has a tentacle hold in the US of A)Stross discovered a new vein to mine by approriating the JM Barrie book Peter and Wendy (not the saccharine Disney story) and using the Lost Boy gang as his characters. And he's writing two other books with the same gang. I got to tell you members of the gang were all attractive and likeable.The villain you want he should die, Any grim fiction that exists is now fodder for his multiverse of madness.

So that's, four? five? generations in this murder that know me. 12 years walking, running, biking the rich white suburban neighborhoods south of my shitbox apartment.I've told the story before about the honor I received last summer when crows on the ground ignored me totally as I walked past, maybe four feet from them. I ignored them as well, but fortunately I had my sunglasses on so I stole jealous sideways glances. They were aware and nonchalant. Warriors. How can such young things be so canny? (It's like octopus, with a short life, but starts out smart. Epigenetic memory?? Shrug)I was dealing with mama and babies. The babies are sister-brothers now and letting everybody know when I go for a hike. Their caws echo out over grandma and grandpa land. I don't know how I got on their bad side, or if I am.I had what I am tempted to call an LSD flashback on my walk today. All of a sudden I had the distinct impression that all the plants were noticing me, knew who I was. I had never considered the idea that they'd been watching me for twelve years. Anyway, the obvious paranoia turned into a grace of living universe, even the pavement beneath my feet. I experienced joy. Would that I could have prolonged that jewel of time, but tripping is not altering reality.Item: I had read a science news article how plants might actually have eyes or the equivalent. And then out on my walk I realized what a bunny I've been these past 12 years, thinking I was apex predator. All this time, like a small town, nature knew my business, my boring robot sleepwalk orc ploddings.Hey, here's some pictures.Madison's OrreryMadison imagined the state as world orbiting a strong federal sun. it was shaky for four score and seven and then flung apart.

{"title": "Fra Mauro", "date": "Saturday, July 17, 2021", "text": "I only did four movie pitches on my last post so here is the fifth, Fra MauroI would otherwise called the movie Apollo 13 but that title's taken.This movie is about if Apollo 13 had no problems and landed on the Moon and returned safely. Boring alternate history, huh?Let me back up. The market for outer space has two sectors: space for Earth and space for space, in turn a  mix of public and private ventures, The space for Earth market is doing quite well, but space for space? Not so much. (excluding public space for space market: scientific exploration). No one is enthused about living in space for good. Can you blame them? Space is for robots, cyborgs and peasants (expendable deplorables). Enthusiasm for the space for space market has always been low, which is why we did not go to Mars in the 1970s and today complain about billionaires.There seems to be no carrot or stick that would shift the earthbound to live in space. Except maybe aliens. Aliens as adversaries to unite us? Forget it. If they can travel quadrillions of miles or between realities, I'm pretty sure they can make us all disappear with a magic word. Aliens as promise? In the form of enhanced technology that makes it worth our while to venture into space, perhaps. It really boils down to creature comforts.There are plenty of space fans today willing to die in space instead of plodding on earth. I'm one. But if it a slave job, and of course it will be, I will not go. I'd just assume we colonize the Solar System with fission-powered robots. So, there better be creature comforts beyond the canned ape subsistence level astronauts enjoy now. Pooping in a baggie in zero G for the rest of life is not an option,Okay back to the Apollo 13 mission. Apollo 14  took up 13's mission and landed in the Far Mauro region Apollo 14 astronauts Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell were to sample ejecta from ther Cone crater, which they did. However due to confusing topography they never reached the rim of the crater. Had they done so, they would have discovered the alien base.So, instead, in my movie, Apollo astronauts, Jim Lovell and Fred Haise make it to the rim of the Cone crater and discover the alien base. It's not like they bonk hit a hatch by accident with a shovel. Once Lovell mounts the rim, what looks like a tumble of rocks is suddenly an obvious artificial structure poking out of the regolith. He says \"Houston, I think we might have a problem\".Earthside, the TVs all go to commercials, followed by no more live Moon feed for the day.(Where should this movie go? Well, for sure, NASA would put its Big Giant Head to work on artificial alien moon base protocols. Evil aliens? Too obvious but benign evil or boring benign, ET... no this has to have a promise to get folks out into space and that is miracle products looted from alien moon bases. Once they identified the Fra Mauro alien moon base, all the other moon bases started radio peeping at them like babies in a nest. But that's in the sequel).Lovell and Haise are ordered to document!  Lovell wants to go check it out. NO says everyone. They are ordered leave their cart and go back to the LEM. Houston tells them to get some sleep if they can while they make new plans. Geologists peering at the pictures, suggest the structure is a billion years old. Before multi-cellular life on Earth. Alien. Eight hours later Houston tells Lovell and Haise to go back and recon. They suit up and trudge their footstep path to the crater, and find the structure has morphed to create an entrance for them right at the end of their bootprints from hours ago.There is an argument whether to go in or not, but you know Jim Lovell is going to accept the invitation.(Again where to go? Pull a Men in the Moon story? I think not. 2001? The most logical, but no. We want dialog. My solution is Willy Wonka. Jim and Fred are shown the miracles of the moon base but then are told they have to test to get in).Jim and Fred are greeted by an attractive and naked man and woman, who invite them to take off their helmets. They do, and don't die, and the naked alien lady says \"Hi. I'm Fran and this is Carl\"Jim and Fred get a moon base adventure. At the end of the ride, Fran tells them there is a test to get a miracle moon base membership. The adventure was the test and they both failed. This meant they have to go home.\"But we welcome others to take the test\". And that starts the mad dash to get to the Moon."},

{"title": "The Slaver Empire", "date": "Thursday, June 3, 2021", "text": "The Great Acceleration, from about 1947 - 1964 was also the Era of Wild Experimentation. Consider all things fission  It was 90 days from the startup of Chicago Pile 1 until the final experiments which solidified atomic pile reactor design. (The patent for a neutronic reactor, US Patent number 2,708,656, would not be made public until 1955).You would be hard-pressed to show me any technology with a shorter development time, from proof-of-concept to working industrial machines. You would be hard-pressed to show me any advanced technology with such a short development time in what was basically a scientific backwater like the United States of America. The United States of America, which, as a backward-looking conservatively federated nation, had resisted most every form of centralized control. This is an allergic reaction to having a bad roommate, which resulted in the American Revolution. For more than two hundred years, the United States of America had been influenced (you might say occasionally ruled by) a loosely agglomerated Southern slave empire. The southern planters, slavers, were among the richest people on Earth. The richest man ever, Mansa Musa, made his wealth from slaves, via salt and gold mining.I present two counterfactuals and I will submit that both result in an American Slaver Empire.As an aside, gentle reader, I will submit that setting up the house of cards is more fun than knocking them down. Which is to say the question of how could it happen interests this autistic boy just as much as what happens after. The trick is to be al scientific like and recognize the minimum number of variables to keep constant until needed for the story. This chaos theory so I'd be disappointed if the orbit didn't go off the rails. In any case,SCENARIO ONE, ONE A, TWO BFor whatever reason, the Western Hemisphere is off limits or not available to European explorers. I don't care how. Okay, the continents of North and South America do not exist. You sail into a monster Pacific. HOW'S THAT?What happens to capitalism? What happens to Spain? A constant in this scenario is European innovations of Chinese inventions. This continues regardless. The Portuguese and Dutch still fuck with India and Indonesia. Cutting edge stuff in those ships and cannon, so they get used.The Muslim world is still competitive, and they loved slaves, so the answer is make more people slaves. Don't fix what's froken. And slavs are slaves throughout the World Island.The other scenario is the native peoples of the Western hemisphere were on equal or better footing than European explorers. Which means someone has to come up with gun powder. Which means the Chinese made it to the west coast. What about all those nasty Afro-Eurasian diseases. If the Norse had more contact, with a 1000CE lotto win of a couple ships with small pox and measles, the resistant populations would be almost back after 500 years. There is a curious Mayan painting of two blonde haired blue eyed fair skinned sacrificial victims. Castaways perhaps, but we must remember the Norse portion of the global trade network was there for 400 years. So, you still have slaves.SCENARIO ONE, TWO B, THREE ZERO ZERO ALPHA The African Diaspora never happens. North America is colonized by only white people. Result? We would have white castes here. Not just slaves, but breeds. Slavery would certainly be here in the USA (if that's what we're called, the more likely outcome feudal lords and slave estates). No question. Once you kill off the Indians its only yourselves to prey upon. Man feasts upon man.Pretty dismal, huh? Makes you want to move to Iceland and live in a geothermal greenhouse with a bunch of bees. \"They ain't making any more land\". Iceland is. What they need is soil. I'm thinking I'm up for leaving my body for Soil For Iceland. What about you? Speaking of soil, we went to Turkey Run State Park, to spread the mixed ashes of mom and dad. A fine smoke of dust wafted up and we inhaled them when we dumped them. Perfect. we became them and they became us. Turkey Run State Park is I think where my younger brother was conceived. A scene for me of many a good time and psychedelic adventure out in the sandstone canyons and cuts of Sugar Creek and her little sister water dragon streams. It is a sacred place for me, and I will be going back. If I pull a Tony Randall and live long enough for the kid to experience it, I will introduce the child(s). As we did to the fearless youngsters of our family whilst there.One last thing. Reminiscing, we talked about the goofy German spike helmet my dad had. It was not the real thing, which is called a pickelhaube, but great grandpa came from Prussia, and not that pussy ass Germany. More specifically we came from the Baltic coast right next to Denmark which is called the Florida of Germany.So I am a German Florida Man. Which explains why my first plan is always murder. Plan A. Always.Plan B??? Now that a year and a month and a day and month and half  and a day of Quarantine has passed? I really don't want to come out of hermit mode.

{"title": "Systemic Hyper-parasitism", "date": "Friday, April 23, 2021", "text": "Two careers ago I was a mainframe programmer at, successively, four multi-billion/international kaiju corporations. They are all gone. Extinct. I would like to think I helped, but that's just my natural arrogance.All of these kaiju, in one form or another, did not die by the free market, not by competition with other kaiju, but rather were bled to death by parasites. More specifically, management infestation in the form of financialization. When I started consulting at Corporate Kaiju Number One, I had one report-to boss between me and my boss's boss. By the time I went to the next gig, there were three bosses in between. And assistants. And administrative staff.  This man-in-the-middle parasitic attack is part of why so many companies are gone, but not the whole story.  A hippo or a grizzly bear has no problem with the parasites sticking out of their assholes. No, these corporate kaijus almost always died of frat bro nepotism, a differnet form of parasitism.Typical frat bro CEO, not realizing they were a piloting a corporate kaiju, made stupid existential choices of one singular puny human being. The first kaiju I consulted at, and having greedily and short-sightedly eaten every dot.com around, disappeared in the 2000 tech bust.( I realize I ruined the labor relations of these companies by being a consultant/gunslinger. Had I a vested interest as a stakeholder, I'd've been more militant. {Probably not, I'm kind of a wuss}. Still, I deprived, as an outsource labor unit, in-company people leverage against the kaiju. But no, Johnny got the attention of the production manager, which made him a little prince, and he worked zero bullshit jobs happily ever after there).Johnny has been lucky to have worked many shit jobs, but just a handful of bullshit jobs. Since my every position was glorified janitor, it's easy to ignore the paperwork. Others not so much.In the 1990s, Eastern Europe, the Russians and Ukrainians, mainly, showed up in the USA to take even more IT jobs. They took a long around and said \"oh yeah we know this drill, except we get paid\". Shareholder owned Soviet Unions, three clerks to sell a loaf of bread.Neo-feudalism? Nope, same old feudalism. Hyper-parasitism, exploiting nested niches. It is said that in Nature, the record is seventeen levels of hyper-parasitism. The evolutionary means to counter parasitism are myriad and oh-so clever. One of my favorites are the mini caste in leaf cutter ants. The regular leaf cutter ants are prey to tiny flies that will lay their eggs in them. The colony developed little tiny ants, minis, that ride around on the workers and shoo away the flies. Maybe that's what I was, a mini.David Graeber* nailed bullshit jobs in a book called Bullshit Jobs. A majority of bullshit jobs not surprisingly are at the top. Consider, 50 years ago, most CEOs were mustangs, rising through the ranks, knowing, not just their business, but their neighboring businesses. But then financialization and pseudo science kicked in. People with wizard degrees from Harvard and Wharton took over from the village witchdoctors. The locals didn't disappear, just got shoved down the corporate food chain into the shit job productive levels that somehow keep corporations making monies despite themselves, and here we are.Graeber attempted to quantify bullshit jobs into categories: flunkies, goons, duct tapers, box tickers, taskmasters. (My thinking the last few years is to think of categories more a dials or slides, and the overall variety as a sound mxing board with slides rather than boxes to place things in. Each fader or blender slide on a mixer can have a mixing component of its own, so slides all the way down)Many of my shit jobs occasionally involved duct taping, so I was immediately struck by the fact that you can have, not just jobs, but aggregates of jobs in subsystems and systems of bullshit (like the upcoming Internet of Shit), and this Wired article by Andy Greenberg on Bullshit Systems made my ears prick up when I saw it. This is classic hyper-parasitism involving rnet extracion via soft-serv ice cream machines (and why they break down so often). The solution, unfortunately, involves duct taping, which you will see a lot of as we enter the Internet of Shit Era. Covering everything from corporate sabotage to right-to-repair, I can't help but realize this as just another example of  Why We Can't Have Nice Things. *David Graeber died of cancer in 2020. One of the organizers of Occupy Wall Street, he also wrote Debt: The First 5000 years. I should re-read that book. Fortunately, before passing Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow wrote a book called The Dawn of Everything due out in October 2021. I can't wait to read it, but based upon what I have read about  their review of the past 42,000 years, a good alternate title might be Something Went Wrong."},

A lot of them are survival skills or low tech hacks, but that's not because I am a survivalist. It's because it's fun.Take gunpowder. What red-blooded American boy doesn't know how to make gunpowder? Johnny got entangled in the web of causation. Do you need sulfur? Why does charcoal work better than coal? Where does this wonderful saltpeter at the drugstore come from? Books at the library pointed me to nightsoil, dedicated piss pots, shit and piss farms.Pre-Revolutionary France was known to have the worst gunpowder in Europe.  A certain count or duke of something something determined how to rake quality saltpeter out of mounds of black dirt infused with copious amount of poop and pee. His holdings also included zinc and lead mines, so he was a bullet farmer. Off went his head in the Revolution. (which should serve as an example to doomsday billionaires).In the event that things get bad (but not TOO bad), I too will be a bullet farmer.The stench? Well, I'm reminded of a story about a Roman merchant that supplied ammonia fermented from piss to the fuller industry. His son was hesitant to take over the business because of the stink. The old Roman shoved a gold coin under his nose and said \"Well, then don't get used to this smell!\" There had to be a speculative shit market in ancient times. In fact, I would bet that certain areas or towns were of renown for making miracle shit.Piss and shit are worth their weight in gold. If you look at folklore you find tons of references to gold being shit. The coin pooping donkey. The devil's ducats, where he spends gold coin and in the morning it is turds. Rumpelstiltskin, spinning (dung infested) straw into gold. Gold is fucking worthless. In Mad Max world, gold as commodity is porn magazines. That's the bitcoin. Survivalists take note.Other things. I am still churning out VR sculptures. Trying to do one a day.Some people say they are awesome.Others, the ones that buy stuff, crickets.I have been thinking about Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord's categories.The general was commander-in-chief of the German Army and an undisguised opponent of Adolph Hitler. He said: \"I distinguish four types. There are clever, hardworking, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and hardworking; their place is the General Staff. The next ones are stupid and lazy; they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the mental clarity and strength of nerve necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is both stupid and hardworking; he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always only cause damage\". Here is a more accurate model, but still only approximating the human essence.Mediocrity rules, thank goodness."},
{"title": "Utopia as a horror show", "date": "Wednesday, March 31, 2021", "text": "Thomas More wrote Utopia as a satire, a critique of the political and economic ills of Europe in the early 16th century. It's a satire in the vein of Juvenal and Aristophanes, which, I'm sorry, aren't funny at all. Unless you think bears forced to fight dogs kind of funny is funny.The modern version of utopia would be Star Trek war socialism, elimination of poverty and strife (at least at a local level), which is not the same as More's utopia but fuck him. A great many people in North America, people of a certain strata, check all the boxes for the modern Utopia.Freedom from Want? Check. Freedom from Violence and Strife? Check. Freedom from Disease? Mostly Check.  Compared to 99.999% of the history of humanity, life in 21st century North America is paradise. So why all the angst? I mean, besides working a soul-killing bullshit job in the standard BDSM deadly-serious-game of hierarchical killer apes whose only safe word for a bottom is \"I quit\"? (In which case you play the deadly-serious-game of homeless and possibly starving).Is it the same feeling of dread that a cow might feel upon entering the slaughterhouse? Could be. We could find all these themes over at TVtropes, with the website itself ironically a link in the Food Chain of Evil. I watched two horror films that I think nudged me to write this essay. The first, A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night, is your standard vampire fare with a really nice black and white atmosphere to it. It is billed as the first spaghetti western vampire movie in Farsi. It explores a theme of vampires as useful scavengers, eliminating the dross and dreck that would otherwise clog up society. A somewhat similar movie would be Innocent Blood, where the vampire protagonist preys upon criminals until that gig goes south when she accidentally turns a mob boss that starts a vampire crime family.So, the Girl is your standard modern vampire, has superhuman strength, retractable sharp teeth, can't go out in the sun, etc. Doesn't turn into a bat whihc honestly is stupid. Funny thing is the original vampire of Balkan folklore had no problem being in the sun. That aspect got started in the late 19th century. Also, the folk vampire has no bones or teeth. Weird.Anyway the mood I picked up is she is knows everything goiing on in her neighborhood, knows who is who and what's what. Perhaps some psychic ability involved to peer into souls. So, she leaves the good people alone and goes for the baddies. Which, given that we are all shits from time to time, would require a certain amount of mercy. I'll get back to this theme of culls in a minute.The other movie was Train to Busan, a Korean fast zombie plague flick. Again, your standard zombie  movie but with some great action sequences and a little character development. The real villains (naturally) are the business executives who unleash this synthetic biotech toxin, and also a COO train passenger who fucks anyone over to avoid becoming a zombie.Which takes us back to vampires.Most business executives wish they were vampires, but nah, just don't have what it takes. However, it makes sense that a moral, merciful vampire would prey upon business executives. From a business standpoint it makes no sense as a much larger criminal prey population is available. Still, business executives are crooks and if you do it right, taking them out would make the world a much less angst-sy place.(As an aside, I never understood the blood sucking thing except as quick means of dispatch. Blood has little nutritive value and I, as a vampire, would prefer sucking on marrow, or just eat the tasty bits of the carcass. Better still, instead of stashing dead bodies like a wolf or a leopard, I'd prefer to keep my meal alive as long as possible. So, maybe I would be a surgeon, or better still a hospital administrator. Which makes me a business executive. How much more of a scumbag would a vampire be as a member of the upper crust, and the answer is quite a lot more of a scumbag).Okay I lost the thread there. The common theme I get from modern horror, from (as much as I can recollect) Invasion of the Body Snatchers to the Blob and the Borg, is not just fighting monsters, but fighting monsters to avoid becoming the same sort of monsters. Which is, of course, lack of free will.But then there are monsters and there are monsters. Zombies? Nobody wants to be a zombie. Okay, some weirdos want to be zombies, or at least want a zombie apocalypse. Me? Pass.Werewolves. That would be cool, but again you lose control, you lose your ego, your conscious self (I think) when you go full wolf. So again, pass.Vampires? Sure. But it could be you lose your soul and will be eternally damned although none of this is certain. In which case, if you lose your soul, you end up being a howling cognitive void encased in skin, which gets us back to the boneless vampire of Balkan folklore, or the eventual all-powerful AI that people worry about. (Needlessly, I think worry about. You don't get from the banal magic of statistical inference to a conscouis being AFAICT).I myself, through psychedelic experiences and observation, am convinced I have no soul. I am a howling cognitive void encased in a meat brain. Which suggests I can be platformed on a mineral brain. But I cannot use inference to suggest that everyone is like me. There may be others that do have souls. In which case I am morally obligated to treat them accordingly and not be mean or vicious or cynical or cruel or suck their blood and stash their living carcasses in a IV suite in a subbasement or warehouse out in Hicksville. Anyway I think that movie has been done. Okay, definitely lost the thread now."},

For that, there are a lot free things. Gravity Sketch, good solid industrial design program. The Facebook/Oculus in-house Quill, which makes me nauseous. Clay analog voxel software Medium. Medium has been sold off to Adobe. There are I'm sure much better systems, but I am comfortable in Medium's saddle and froze and walled it off from the wilder yonder, if that's possible. If you haven't experienced VR, the good stuff is almost too immersive. There should be a dial to get back to the outside. My rig has really nice sounds for my music. Sometimes, ambient background noise makes me feel someone is in the room with me. I will tear off my visor to an empty room.A Black Mirror/Twilight Zone episode: My rig has a B&W camera used for setup of floor and safety zone. Ambient noise makes me feel someone is in the room. I turn the dial on the camera and a looming figure stands over me. After a brief heart attack, I rip the visor off to an empty room.After I'd played with immersive sculpture and animation, I thought so we are back to the stolen dreams of the 80s. Ready Player One. But there has to be more. I thought of ideas, but the good ideas are good for a reason and a lot of people think of them. Then there are the people with more money who fuck up your good idea. VRChat, and before that Altspace, the WoW of VR social. Although the avatars were fun, the kiddies were annoying. Pass. Although VRchat had full body trolling with sensors wrapped around the ankles. Hands, ankles, visor is all you need. A cheap Mocap suit for what? $450? $700? I thought of sports bar avatar karaoke on the big screen. Slip on wrist and ankle sensors, a head band, tied into a VJ station, and you get the Masked Singer Dancer on the big TV screens.

I've read perhaps a dozen accounts of this conflict and watched half as many documentaries. I'll tell you how it turns out. Japan loses.Many, including a former President with a strange smeared-shit-on-toilet-paper pallor and tiny hands, consider this America's greatest moment. Which is hilarious. A savage gump of a hick nation from the 1930s, with a laughable science program, kicks the crap out of a guy ten times smaller, and then somehow creates a physics-powered Long Boom economy.The irony is the so-called greatness was done with a command economy and the help of a refugee population that gave us nuclear power and TV sitcoms.WWII itself is not the glory we see in the movies and in our retarded popular culture. It will be remembered by our hopefully more advanced descendants as a burst open stinking carcass that best be buried in a cornfield someplace.Regardless, each historical account provides another excerpt worth remembering, and here is the excerpt I culled from this book, 10/25/1944 at the Battle off Cape Engano, Bill Davis flying a Hellcat from the Lexington:\"At 10,000 feet there was a thick black cloud of bursting shells from the 40mm and 5 inch guns... a second deadly cloud forming at 4,000 feet from the exploding 20mm* shells\". Knowing that velocity was his friend, Davis firewalled the throttle. Pulling out of the dive, he estimated he was flying more than 500 miles an hour, significantly faster than Grumman's recommended maximum. He was low over the sea, and a Japanese heavy cruiser loomed ahead. Rapidly it grew larger in his windshield; he did not have time to turn away. Davis pulled up and banked hard adn to the right, passing between the superstructure and the forward gun turret. \"I was perhaps three feet from the windows on the bridge and could see the Japanese officers and enlisted men commanding the ship,\" he said. \"There was an admiral in dress whites, complete with sword. The other officers and men were also in dress whites. I was going 530 miles an hour, and I only got a glimpse, but that image is impressed on my mind forever.\""},
{"title": "Agisoft Metashape", "date": "Thursday, March 11, 2021", "text": "Agisoft Metashape is a stand-alone software package that processes digital images into a 3D spatial data. Improved from their earlier quite popular Photoscan, this photogrammetry program uses a Structure From Motion (SFM) technique to build a \"mesh\" structure of the object's surface. Briefly, SFM uses overlapping digital images combined with the camera's location data (metadata) to perform complex geometric calculations to determine a \"point cloud\" of surface dots. The dots are then connected to produce a polygon mesh of the object. Metashape can also extract images from video.Metashape has a large support structure - tutorials, user manuals, blogs to rely upon. It has an educational license for significant cost savings. The Educational license ($59) is available in both Floating (installed on multiple work stations), or Node-locked (a single rehostable work station). Metashape has a straightforward UI for loading and processing photos.The number of photos is under no restriction (unlike other packages both free and commerical). Once photos are added, a mask function can be used to reduce irrelevant elements (background, accidental foreground, etc.) to reduce noise and prevent \"merging\" of the object with other surfaces. The mask function has nice feature where you only need to mask a few images, select points based on the masks, and clean up the other images automatically. It has intuitive masking tools (Magic Wand and Intelligent Selection tools) that make an otherwise tedious task less tedious,Next the photos are aligned to refine the camera locations and then a dense point cloud is produced. A number of tools exist to refine the point cloud. For example a manual bounding box can be created to orient and refine the point cloud (this is can also be done automatically). The dense point cloud is calculated using depth information from the camera location data. Once the point cloud is built, the mesh is built and ready for export. Each step has a number of parameters that can be used to further refine the 3D model. The nice thing about this batch process is it is relatively quick compared to other photogrammetry packages (seconds to minutes versus minutes to hours or days) and also has a tooling feature that will optimize the batch for a specific GPU on your computer, significantly speeding up processing time. You may also have a low/medium//high feature settings to get a quick and dirty 3D model, and then reprocess with high setting for the final model.The mesh can also be refined from the depth maps (the camera location data) to create better details as well. It's a solid piece of software, rarely freezing or crashing, that produces nicely detailed results in a timely manner."},

That whole 1931 - 1945 arc really needs to happen to the good ol' USA. And it will. And we will deserve it.Let me back track to watching two Studio Ghibli movies; Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. Both are lamentations of a then 60 year old Japanese Boomer how Millennials had given up all the old filthy habits and superstitions (not that Shintoism has gone away), but all those filthy habits and god bothering were good landscape practices. The movies got me teary-eyed sentimental old man. I watched Spirited Away with both English and Japanese subtitles. The nostalgia of the 6th extinction is permeated throughout this movie. I understand.Born in 1957, my world is now 2/3rds DEAD. Ten years ago it was halfway dead. now it's 2/3rds.We are behind schedule for Soylent Green (2022) but it not for lack of trying.The really alarming thing was helping my brother move down to Missouri. Missouri wasn't alarming. Driving 8 or 9 hours, I had no reason to wipe bugs from my windshield. In the 1970s, you had to clean bug smear all the time. We've had an alarming drop in bugs. This is bad. This explains the lowering sperm counts. We are very elegantly getting out of the way not fast enough. If you wonder whose schedule we're on look up and wave at the 1%. The achieved escape velocity in Q2 1972 and happily ever after. The Snakes and Spiders Club is open to all. We recognize talent in both force and fraud.Which gets us back to Japan of late 1944-45. We USAsians really need to get it hammered in what war does. At the end, they were eating mice and sending killer kyle zombie robots we call kamikaze.All of this suicidal fanaticism was not Old Japan, it was manufactured in the 1930s by mass media. (Writing being the first atomic bomb). (TV the H-bomb). (Internet???)Point being, I had our chances at 50-50 even-steven in 2020 but now we looking at getting civilization cat-friendly after we are gone. If that's where you want to go. There was a SF story about how we were the rats and the dinosaurs left in spaceships (and also bombed Earth with a comet fragment), and we, the rats, are building spaceships now.The only way we would have continued the space lunar program is if Buzz Aldrin or someone found the entrance to the ancient dinosaur moon base.To live in that alternate Earth, I think it more likely we die sooner."},

Decades, and with the cost of trillions of dollars!\"\"Scrap that wasteful government SLS program! Spacex is doing what no one has done before!\"Well, government doesn't do it. Government hands out shit-tons of monies to contractors who do it. Look at any massive public works. Duh.And Musk has, with his as-yet-to-be-reusable rockets, duplicated efforts that go back to 1957. Congrats, Elon, you made it to the Kaputniks of the 1950s. But a lot of people forget about the Delta Clipper.Funded by the DoD and contracted out to McDonnell-Douglas. The DC-X was developed in just 21 months at a cost of $60 million. First trial was 8/18/93, 20 years before Spacex Grasshopper. The DC-X worked not just the first time. It worked every time. NASA reluctantly took over the operation and kind of sabotaged it. NASA had it's own program through Lockheed Martin Venture Star. Honestly Lockheed has been resting on its laurels since the SR-71, though they still had lots of good engineers. The X-33 (Venture Star) was the victim of a lot of bad management decisions, both in design and construction. The big problem was choosing to make the liquid hydrogen tank out of advanced composites, which were just not up to snuff.The X33 could have flown, but did not, and we have been wasting our time for 20 years. And as far as I can tell, Elon Musk continues to waste our time with his (eventual, I'm guessing), very expensive transcontinental cargo ship.Ho-hum."},

Not to mention our dropping sperm counts. There's accounting for attrition, which happens with all migrations. Colonizers to Virginia had a 2 in 10 chance of surviving. And that's with plentiful air, water, and a really nice radiation shield called the magnetic field.So, unless trillions of humans can be produced, even the Solar System is out of reach.Oh sure, there'll be human outposts, but nothing long term.

Of spaceships and moon bubble bases and all the Jetson stuff written by people who grew up in the 1920-30s. but more 20s as that is when all the tech archetypes were established, the aspects and attributes of future modern life.Think of Star Trek. Written by old fogies with visions of Captain Hornblower in Space, Wagon Train to the Stars, with cultural references from detective stories and true crime novels. A limited vision which the populace of popular culture, bless them, can envision. Same with the Dungeons and Dragons of Star Wars.

Somebody somehow convinces Nixon the NERVA program has uses beyond Mars in the defense industry. Star Wars. Nixon says, Ok keep going. That's the premise.Consequence. So they fit the thermal nuclear rocket engine to a B1 frame and just use it as a reusable booster. At first people are freaked but then they think it is cool to watch the damn thing land. The first time two of them land together, popular imagination finally catches on. Detroit, where Chrysler makes the B1 air frame, becomes Rocket City. This is all before Three Mile Island, so once the first crash happens with no radiation leaks, despite pinko commie bleating, everybody shrugs it off. Besides, we can put battleships in orbit and no one else can, yet. The public is like yay Space Force! and then Nixon gets impeached.Yay Space Force but then the public is like where's the cruise destination bitches. Boo Space Force. But the tevch was there and lots of companies competed to improve it. By the 90s Pan-Am launches the first spaceliner to orbit. Basically, 40 years ahead of ourselves. 2001: A Space OdysseyAnyway, it can still happen. Not to diminish the engineering talent of companies like Westinghouse and Aerojet but that thermal nuclear rocket almost fell together in development like it wanted to exist.

{"title": "Nuclear Fusion Rocket Engine", "date": "Monday, February 22, 2021", "text": "But first, let's all welcome Rush Limbaugh to Hell. If ever anyone distilled the acid bile of white supremacy, bigotry and chauvinism, bottled it in victim-size personal containers, it's Rush. People will say he was being funny, kidding, joking around. No, our soft round boy was never kidding and everyone knew it. He was just a mean feral pest.Hopefully, Rush is being passed around like an underage Dominican pajama boy from demon to demon, contracting every possible venereal disease in existence. Anyway, let's talk nuclear fusion rocket engines. You would think a rocket engine would be easier to build than a reactor, seeing as you don't need a sustained and contained reaction, but you always have that squishy spurts at the magnetic pinch that kablooeys the plasma burn. Fusion has been produced since 1932 with a cyclotron by Marc Oliphant at Cambridge's Cavendish laboratory. Fusion is easy to do. Why, a high school science fair student could (has) produce nuclear fusion by constructing a Farnsworth Fusor. The problem is producing a big enough reaction to propel spaceships.My guess is a successful fusion rocket will, well, first of all it s all magnets. But my guess is a fusion rocket will require a little machine learning AI to cuddle and tickle the plasma to create an exhaust. An AI that we will find composed of algorithms we cannot understand. The fusion rocket will be an alien organ, and part of a larger animal called your spacecraft. You can read all sorts of technical things on fusion engine but I would prefer to work it as a Fermi question from three assumptions. First, that the engine fuses regular old hydrogen. No fancy lithium deuteride fuel like Project Daedalus used. Let's assume a boron nitride consumable along with the liquid hydrogen fuel, utilizing a cominaion of laser driven intertial confinement and magnetic compression powering a magnetic pulse plasma, and leave it at that. The second assumption is that whatever the engine looks like, it is about the size and weight (8400kg)of a Rocketdyne F1 engine.I choose the F1 as still the most powerful rocket engine built (late 50s) and its performance characteristics are well known. 1.5 million pounds of thrust. Managed by pumps that could drain an Olympic size pool in seconds.The third assumption is we are using an Orion spacecraft as payload which is about 22,700kg in mass, and a rocket configuration similar to the first stage of a Saturn 1B, which gives us a rocket dry mass of about 42,000kg, for a total mass of 64,700kg. Ready to be bored with math? Here we go. A B11-proton fusion reaction produces about 8.9 million electron volts per reaction.Treating the boron nitride component as part of the engine allows us to use only the mass of the hydrogen fuel for energy density which works out to about 107 trillion joules per kilogram.So our ideal exhaust velocity from momentum equation, E=1/2 *m * V^2, converts to V = sqrt(2* E/m), plug in the 107 in E/m, gives us V = sqrt(214tj/kg) = 14,629 km/sec.That's not bad considering. Okay, lets' go to Mars. Or Mars and back.Accelerating at 1 g to go halfway to Mars, flip over and decelerate at 1 g to Mars, gives us a very comfy ride that takes, in total depending on the distance, about 8 days 9 hours round trip (assuming average distance of 2 AU). This is about 7128.6 km/sec total speed for the tripSo, using the idealized Tsiolkovsky rocket equation of  propellant mass is U = 1 - 1/exp(total speed/exhaust velocity) = 1 - exp(7128.6/14629) = .245 of total mass.Given that our rocket is 66,700kg gives is a total liquid hydrogen weight of 66,770 * .245 = 16,345kg. Liquid hydrogen has a density of 71 kg per cubic meter meaning the fuel tank is about 21 meters x 21 meters which is just about the size of the fuel tanks of our Saturn 1B first stage.For comparison purposes, a Saturn 1B equipped with an Orion spacecraft payload and using an F1 engine would use 399,400kg of fuel.Wait, you say, I thought a ton of deuterium fusion fuel is equal to 29 billion tons of coal, and our propellant mass from crude chemical to fusion rocket is only .04 which is 4/100s. Not very impressive.Fine. This was a crude estimation problem* and besides I'm getting you to Mars in 4 days versus 9 months. Sure we can do better on the approximation but would you rather fly my fusion rocket or end up a tumor-ridden cripple on one of Elon Musk's Starships?"},

The Long Boom, the post-WWII good times, was an anomaly, a grotesque aberration which stuck in the craw of the rich for intolerable decades. Fortunately, we worked our way back to inequality and the hereditary meritocracy the rich felt had been taken from them. This is, of course, a false narrative as the rich have always enjoyed their economic apartheid, but Q2 1972 was when they were freed forever by machines and algorithms. Now that they had built a secure enclave of domesticated food-powered robot peasants, it was simply a matter of time before they would be entirely rid of the remaining ferals, the stinky food-powered robot peasants.The 21st century beckoned, when all the cool technocratic shit was going to be available. Not flying cars. Fuck flying cars. What a stupid idea. No, we were supposed to have nuclear fusion, space colonies, cities under the sea, IQ enhancing drugs, smart robots, age-prolongation/rejuvenation, and food-o'plenty grown in little plastic tubs so Earth could once again become an earthly paradise.All stale century-old dreams of some nerd from the 1920s. Let's pick a current one with the same narrow vision.How about Elon Musk? Too easy? True, he's a dork with poor communication skills, a perfect product of the current capitalist fitness curve, the narrative of beneficial inequality, but he also has bullshitted so many otherwise sane or semi-intelligent people.Elon Musk gonna put Texas on the map. Between his prediction of an Austin boom town to Starship, he figures he will be the first trillionaire. That's a million million, and that's something worth being scared of.Elon Musk piloting a Texas Mecha into the sunset gonna trod upon a lot of ape-shaped ants, but, hey, Elon Musk is going to Mars.Elon Musk is not going to Mars.Certainly not with that goofy Buck Rogers Starship. The logistics of a space colony I briefly went into some six years ago in this essay. The odds of a successful space colony are even worse today, but there is no way you win the Solar System* without at least a nuclear thermal rocket, and, quite honestly, even then it's a no-go. You need a nuclear fusion rocket to do anything beyond delivering corpses or tumor-ridden cripples to Mars. Anyone who looks at the numbers realizes Starship is just a stunt, a con to separate rubes from their monies. Here's a pretty good critique about Starship. I really don't understand why people laud Musk for doing things that were done 60 years ago, and with a lot less computing power. But hey. Musk is supposedly trying to make a resusable launch vehicle to cut down the payload cost of Earth-to-LEO through economies of scale. Current cost is $2,720/kg on a Falcon 9. (Actual cost is much higher due to adding in beyond the launch cost).The thing that really pisses me off is the USA had a perfectly acceptable nuclear thermal rocket from the NERVA test days, back when it was estimated (from actual test results) a nuke launch would be around $10/kg. True, people worried about a nuclear booster crash, but we've already got so much plutonium in our bones, what's a few nanograms-per-person more? I think it's really interesting that the last test of a nuclear thermal rocket, the NERVA-XE in 1969, was just at the ankle bend of the development curve, and, 50 years later, would be kicking the living crap out of any existing chemical rocket. Given 50 years development and use, there would currently be at least 10 million tons of stuff in orbit right now. Easily. As opposed to the ISS 420 tons. What's a few atomic accidents, considering the fuck-ups we've already experienced?So, Elon is no dummy. He knows this. He's conning you."},

The lowly mechanick of two centuries ago, competent by today's standards, was thought of little better than a whore.Like actors.

Here is a picture of a fascinus, a penis charm to ward off evil. One wonders why Mr. Spock from Star Trek (himself bearing a resemblance to Satan or some other dark elf from Fairyland) found everything fascinating. Lots of distracting bonerific stuff out there in the galaxy to distract the gaze of the evil eye, I guess.So, how did I end up checking out boner, buttock, and vulva charms? Well, this rabbit hole started out with the news item about the arson of a house in Poughkeepsie, NY. The house was a \"Halloween house\" used by the Church of Satan. Someone burned it down. What caught my eye was the house was located in the \"witchcraft district\" in the city. This lead me to read about the witch houses of the Hudson valley. This article documented the strange objects hidden behind walls or secret rooms or voids within the houses built by the early Dutch colonists of the Northeast. Many of these artifacts were eventually recognized as apotropaic totems or objects to ward off evil. I myself, helping with the rehab of an old 19th century house in NW Indiana back in the 90s, came across objects and carvings in the walls . At the time we were incurious and only moderately creeped out and paid it no mind. But now, I recognize it all as a method to ward off evil. Not all the objects are house wards. Witch bottles, containing human hair, finger and toe nail clippings, bent nails and broken pins, were used as personal charms to distract evil spirits from inhabitants, especially children. The idea being a spirit would be lured to the bottle via sympathetic human remains, there to be trappped an injured or killed by the \"dead\" nails and pins.Anyway, this lead me to read about apotropaic genitalia in all its forms. Penises are used but also vulvae and buttocks. This no doubt is why so many vagina dentata carving sare found throughout the world. Bare buttocks were also utilized, such as the Aphrodite Kallipygos statue.So, in American culture, perhaps the strictures against nudity go beyond mere prudish or squeamish Puritanical bias, and recognize the power of the naughty bits."},

{"title": "A Libertarian Walks Into A Bear", "date": "Monday, December 28, 2020", "text": "A Libertarian Walks Into A Bear: The Utopian Plot to Liberate An American Town by Matthew Hongoltz-HettlingShort Review: Bears Make Better Libertarians Than People DoLonger Review: This is the story of still another failed attempt at American utopia in the state of New Hampshire, plus some bears.Back in 2004, the town of Grafton was targeted for takeover by a ragtag group of libertarians and like-minded folk. They almost succeeded, and the result is what you would expect when all sorts of public goods are starved of taxpayer funding: infrastructure collapse and the inexorable turn towards tribal chaos of factions.New Hampshire proudly retains the idea of well-armed rugged individualism that goes back to the time of Revolution. I find it amusing that so many right wing authoritarians assume that America is just a slight push or tug away from Marxist dictatorship, without realizing that this requires a level of organization and planning that Americans are simply not capable of. Hell, the Russians weren't capable of it, and they had a Ministry of Terror, a gulag system, and a network of personal spying to attempt it.Libertarians pride themselves on logic, so when the Freedom folks met in a town hall meeting with Grafton residents, the amount of hostility towards liberation surprised them. No amount of internet bulletin board arguments seemed to win over these emotional and irrational rural bumpkins. The fact that the Freedom folks did not anticipate the acrimony and suspicion suggests that their argument was based upon their own illogical and unrealistic premises.So the Freedom folk do what all liberators do. They took over the town. (Notice a pattern? Scratch a Hippie, find a Nazi). They immediately inserted themselves into positions of authority, grabbed every lever and button of power they could find, and shut the tax collection system down hard.The result? The Free Town of Grafton fell apart. Roads and bridges fell into disrepair and remained unplowed in winter. Buildings burned down for lack of a coordinated public fire department, shut down of the town administration due to lack of funds, and a huge migration of bears.Quick note of explanation: the bears were there due to state policy and popular sentiment. At the turn of the last century, New Hampshire was thoroughly domesticated and prosperous, with nary a stick of woods remaining in the whole state. Circumstances, both unfortunate and intentional, caused the fortunes of the state to wane as farmers abandoned their freeholds, industry moved to tax havens and cheaper labor, and traders grew more and more short-sighted. Add in the environmental movement of the 60s and 70s, and you end up with a state that soon returned to the dark medieval forests of pre-Revolutionary times. Which the bears loved, and since people think bears are people, people loved as well. Another quick note: bears are not people. They are forward thinking, possessed of long memories, alarmingly clever problem-solvers, observant of habit, theory-of-mind types that can think like people, get in the heads of people, but they are not people. To look in a bear's eyes is to see they are quite alien. I'm sure the bears think the same of us hairless primates.So, and not surprisingly, bear problems became a problem. This is not to say the libertarians (and all the eccentric kooks magnetically attracted to them) were responsible for the bear problems, but they sure didn't help. Within the decade-long failed experiment, there were two horrific bear attacks (no fatalities) which resulted in indifference and victim-blaming from the state game wardens, and a gamut of responses from the town, ranging from a vigilante posses slaughter of bears, to those who would dart, tag, and radio-collar the bruins.The ongoing (legal and illegal) slaughter of bears did nothing long term to solve the problem. Despite the culls, bear numbers grew, and the bears became bolder and bolder. There were also people who fed the bears. One in particular, Doughnut Lady, ended up with a twice daily food pantry service for dozens of bears. Passers-by were alarmed at the woods filled with nothing but bear around her house. Often times, people wondered why the bears did not eat her, but I guess it just goes to show the average bear is more patient and less short-sighted than the average human. The bears knew they had a good thing going, and you don't fuck that up by killing the golden goose. This is not a great insight, that if you feed wild animals and do not molest them, they are willing to tolerate you. See: cats.I should note the human tragedy of Tent City near Grafton, those survivalist types who preferred Paleolithic freedom. Problem was, that ship had sailed with the Neolithic revolution, and also these guys were extremely ill-equipped in both mind and body to handle the intellectual and physical rigors of the lifestyle. Plus, they kept their cars. So, the result was the liberty to live in squalor and shit in buckets, scrounge for donuts and fresh water that had not been shit in, like living in a Syrian civil war tent city (note to the current right wing batch of civil war advocates, you'll die of typhus in about a month).The bears became such a problem for the dwellers of Tent City that they opted for a solution strangely reminiscent of Donald Trump's efforts along the southern border of the US. They built a wall. They built a big, beautiful barrier to keep the bears out. So, yes, the freedom seekers hid and huddled in squalor behind barricades to seek a level of security against the very Nature they desired to live as one with.Long story short, failed experiment. But fear not, libertarians have upped the ante and now are pushing for the Free State takeover of New Hampshire, but with all the statist trappings they now find acceptable, like property taxes and zoning ordinances and fire codes and the amenities that go with it: public pools, libraries, tennis and basketball courts, playgrounds, etc. And hardly any bears at all."},

The rinderpest worked its way south from Ethiopia and a decade later 90% of cows, oxen, sheep, buffalo, wildebeast and giraffe are dead. East Africa starved.English colonists imported massive amounts of harm (HAH!)FARM animals and most importantly pigs.English colonists did not know about African Swine Fever because the local pigs and ticks and microbes had found an uneasy truce. And European pigs dropped like flies, but not enough to attain herd immunity. ASFV became endemic in sub-Saharan pigs. Fast forward to 2018 when an outbreak of ASFV forced China to eventually slaughter half its pigs.By Chinese New Year 2019 there wasn't a pig to be found, so the wet markets of China provided meat from peacocks to alligators to snails and hedgehogs.

{"title": "The Five People You'll Meet In Prison", "date": "Tuesday, November 3, 2020", "text": "The Five People You'll Meet in Prison by Brandon M. StickneyPart prison diary, part expose, I really didn't learn anything new about the American prison system (in this case the New York state penitentiaries). I saw this guy on the WGN morning news and he was funny and engaging but the book less so. The American prison system is set up to punish and the best a prisoner can hope for from the administration and officers is malignant neglect. Stickney meets five people who are kind to him, including a corrections officer.I think the only thing that I got from the book was an uncomfortable reminder of the number of similarities between American prison life and American life. This is not a new insight from me.The American prison system is the largest in the world and is thus one of the largest slave plantations on the planet. As far as administration is concerned, it's a win/win. Taxpayer funds for each prisoner and almost free labor out of them. Stickney noted New York state spends $60 grand a year on each prisoner, and perhaps actual spending on prisoners more in the range of $14-20 grand. That's quite a profit. In that situation, as product, as a commodified person, they'd want to treat the prisoners with the least amount of damage. But that's not the case.Torture, yes, just so the torture would be preferred not to the death (unless they're insane or retarded). In any event the torture is enforcement only, to protect the prison (not the prisoners from each other), but it still happens.Otherwise it is indifferent neglect and the inmates run the day to day maintenance. So am I saying the USA is a prison? No, but it does have a lot of coincidences.If we treat the USA as a prison system, then the great American dream is to move from prisoner to cop, to boss. Maybe that explains why Americans all want to be take charge like cops and bosses.Maybe a different take from some other research might help. Below you see trend of household income for the bottom 60%, 61-99% and top 1% from 1986 to 2014. Consider the bottom two thirds prisoners, upper one third cops, and top bosses.Now see the trend true to scale:No new insight other than a similar repressive system."},

Nice!It is said that had he drilled as little as six feet from the spot he chose, he would not have hit oil. He managed to find the tippy top of the oil deposit. He was almost out of money, so he would've had to stop, and either someone else would be the Edwin Drake of oil, or the oil industry may have been delayed by years or decades. Probably not.It turns out Apollo 15 astronaut David Scott had the opposite luck of Edwin Drake while drilling core samples. They had problems with the lunar sample drill but eventually got a ten foot deep core sample. Had Astronaut Scott drilled as little as six feet away from the spot he chose, he would have run into an ice chimney of the ice glacier beneath them at Hadley, part of a vast sublunar network of mantle ice.What impact on historical events would there have been if water on the Moon had been discovered 49 years earlier than today? Answer: not much.Recall that the public attention and popular imagination had already soured on the Moon landings. The folks at NASA would have been clamoring for a permanent residence on the Moon after the 1971 water ice discovery, but no one else was interested. Not Congress. Certainly not Nixon. And so, the space program would have continued as it did. Or... in 2020 30 million people live on the Moon.

Regardless, it suggests time travel without consequence. The Penrose diagram is for a Kerr blackhole turned into wormhole. This is more properly the Homer Simpson universe where the universes (labeled R1, R2..) are connected top to bottom, side to side making a toroid: a donut universe with the black hole as donut hole. The ring singularity is all singularities. Which, there you go, wormhole = time travel and probably by sticking a fork into a toaster as Homer Simpson did in a treatment of Ray Bradbury's \"A Sound of Thunder\". You know, the one where the time travelling hunter steps on a butterfly and screws up the future. But there's a suggestion that the universe is more robust due to entanglement. That a \"wound\" made in the past will heal in the present. Here's the egghead article, and the English translation:To simulate time travel, we sent qubits through the computer gates in reverse order. The gates manipulate the qubits and represent time steps as well. Then we damaged information in this simulated past by measuring just one local qubit, while all the other qubits maintained their quantum correlations and remained entangled. After the damaging measurement, we ran our forward-in-time protocol and then measured the qubit’s state: it had returned to essentially the same state it had been in before backward evolution, plus some small background noise. Because the initial state of the whole system was strongly entangled in quantum correlations, the long complex evolution essentially recovered the information of the perturbed qubit.  To our surprise, we not only disproved the butterfly effect in a quantum system, but we also found a sort of no-butterfly effect, as if the system wants to protect the present.So, if this holds, we have a whole new amusement park. I'm not the first to think of it. Robert Silverberg, who thought a lot about time travel, wrote a story where the protagonist was a time travel tour guide. He mentions how each time he takes a group to an event like the Cruci-fiction, the crowds get larger and louder. They are not worried about changing the past.Which gets us to Wild Time Tours. Go back in time, do whatever you want. Tread on butterflies. Unscrew the heads of dinosaurs. Kill Hitler. Kill Jesus. Nuke the Holy Roman Empire. What's your fantasy? It doesn't matter anyway. And you get videotape.I myself an part of the Famous Peoples Assassin Squad. I've killed Caesar, Hitler, Ghengis Khan, Stalin, Mao in the bathtub, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter debating, you name it. The crowd reaction shots are the gravy. Does that make me a psychopath? Well, then it was Fate, weren't it?"},

It’s about a con man who travels the world under the guise of being a “sex researcher” in order to spy for the US government. The novel begins with protagonist Steve Victor in Damascus for the kickoff of an “extensive survey of Arab and Oriental sex practices.” There he is approached by a US diplomat and invited to the embassy. In short order, Victor is recruited to spy for the US government. The novel is an unbearable horror show. It’s violent and grotesquely pornographic, containing toddler brothels and graphic details of children and infants being ceremonially raped and trained into sex slavery.What we know right now is that the despicable rich have won the caste war and it's daylight robbery. When financial scandals and the charlatans who love them are shrugged off, when Panama Papers of tax cheat and fraud is released and the only news afterwards is the journalist gets car bombed, then we are just fucking sheeple like they say.The deplorable poors only recourse is violence and even that seems pointless. Your AR-15? My nerve gas. My engineered virus. What I get out of this article is that people are stupid. People are easily tricked. Most especially the ones that are smart, in both categories. Was Epstein a genius? No. More like Dillinger he had to fuck all the time. Was he murdered? Oh yeah. Is QAnon barking up the wrong tree? No, but it's a really big tree and they are on just the one side. Was he a spy? No. Was he an asset? I agree with the writer:This urge to make Epstein’s power sophisticated and complex serves a similar purpose as the elites’ insistence on Epstein’s extraordinary genius–both are ways of squaring the evident smallness of the man himself with the vastness of the world he built and the seemingly outsized influence he possessed. Both of them betray a collective lack of imagination when it comes to just how ludicrously rewarded dumbasses can be in this country. Epstein didn’t have to be anything special to become a key player in an evil conspiracy. He had to be rich, and he had to be useful to people richer and more powerful than he was. The very real possibility is that Epstein was both a rich dumbass and a key player in an evil conspiracy, because evil conspiracies require nothing more."},

Skulls, shin bones and such, were in a bad state of decay, but per orders, the bones were crushed with charcoal, burned in a gas kiln. The rucksack containing the ashes was taken to a river. The wind caught the ashes up into a little brown cloud and that was the last time anyone saw of Mr. and Mrs Hitler.You might ask why it took so long to destroy the remains and the answer is the bodies were being used at a SMERSH base in Magdeburg to open demonic portals to other other times and spaces.

It's what gave the Soviet Union the first interstellar colony.Luna Moy, a moon circling a gas giant around an F type star about 9.7 billion light years away, in the direction of the Pleiades, was officially called the Ark by the USSR. A mini-me USSR. And by 1969, when the mojo ran out on Hitler's skull, the Soviet Union had 370,000 colonists on Luna Moy.Once the US found out about all this, they tried out all sorts of dead remains, starting with civil war generals, founding fathers, ol' Andy Jackson himself, all with poor results.

Technically, it's all a game. I will bet you right now I lose this game at the age of 72.When I was a kid, we got the game of Risk. The tokens for the armies were singles and tens. Or maybe fives. The pieces were extruded plastic triangles and taller pentagons.  I found out later these token shapes were called Castle Risk pieces. Older version of the game used colored wooden blocks. And now they are something else.We made up our own rules for Risk because it was boring and interminable.One really fun thing we did was to incorporate Monopoly into the game of RiskRisk, but with money, a Bank, houses and hotels. Hotels were obviously fortresses. And over time the houses went from forts to fort/factories. We revamped the whole army replenishment system with money.Beginning of your turn, you get money from the Bank, less maintenance fee, interest payment (yes, loans from the Bank evolved early) and penalties to buy armies, factories and Hotels.After some games ending in acrimony with every last dollar spent, the question arose, can the Bank create money?It was decided yes.Only a certain amount of Debt, before Planetary Destruction, with every last future tree cut down, fish caught, shit burned.

{"title": "The Bee Louse", "date": "Friday, July 3, 2020", "text": "Braulidae, or the bee louse, is actually a small fly (about 1.5mm long). They have the superficial appearance of lice, no doubt an adaptation for living upon bees, grasping the hairs of the head and thorax.Bees have a lot of enemies. Predators, disturbers, commensals, and parasites. For some reason, the bee louse is considered a commensal rather than a parasite, despite the fact that the little fuckers steal food from the mouths of bees. They are considered 'guests' within a hive, but I would call them kleptoparasites. They prefer living on the queen as the queen gets all the best stuff like honey and royal jelly fom the nurse bees.(Interestingly, a brief exposure to tobacco smoke narcotizes the bee louse, and it can be collected on sticky wax paper placed under the hive and disposed of, a practice going back to 1740).There is speculation that it uses chemical camouflage, not unlike varroa mites. So, and there hangs the tale. Is it a form of mimicry, pretending to be a bee? Is it a form of invisibility, so that the bee ignores the parasite? Or is it a behavioral pheromone, meaning the bees notice but are not alarmed or don't care? I'm betting the last as typically the social pheromones in honeybee colonies are long lasting hydrocarbons easy to produce. And is there an analog to the bee louse in our monkey hives? What if there are invisible weird little fuckers living with us? I had a weird feeling about that. I thought of brownies, elves, fairies, but all of them have good connotations in folklore of helping people, right? Before I went and started marking the level of my milk bottles and counting how many beers were left, could there be some other form of kleptoparasite that was not magically invisible? Something that was not necessarily a different species from us? Something, or someone, we notice and shrug off?Because it seems to me that humanity is riddled with kleptoparasites.Any ideas, aside from the usual suspects at the top of the monkey hive? Typicaly prejudice is tilted towards the poor, like gypsies and hoboes stealing cooling pies from window sills..Or snatching small children and replacing them with straw dolls. But what if it's all the banksters and white collar criminals that the equivalent of the bee louse? Clearly a brief exposure to tobacco smoke and sticky wax paper is an inadequate response."},

Ninevah had beenlaid waste a mere two hundred years before Xenophon’s arrival and was already forgotten.Hey, those massive walls worked great didn’t they? This isthe lesson of what I call Land Power culture. Static solutions to staticproblems get you 2,500 years of dirt piled on top of you.The Danes are said to be an island people who happen to owna peninsula. They have retained a maritime culture. They are a Sea Power culture.The United States can be viewed as a Navy that happens toown a continent. Sadly, there are shitheads trying to eradicate this worldview.Much has been written about the advantages of Sea Power culture, the mostobvious being Alfred T Mahan’s The Influence of Sea Power Upon History. Mahan convincedTeddy Roosevelt to build up the US Navy.I would argue that a culture need not be near the sea to bea Sea Power culture, any more than Viking is an ethnicity (it’s not, it’s aprofession). The usual suspects are Athens, Carthage, Venice, the DutchRepublic, the Scandinavian countries, Great Britain, the US of A. I would argue that the Mongol Empire, prior to stagnation, was a SeaPower culture, as was Prussia, the Huns,  Islam in the 8th century, etc. Thecommonality being vast tracts of land with no physical barriers, thus forcingthe inhabitants to face and adapt to powerful enemies via fluid responses (e.g.horses rather than ships).Which is to say, SeaPower cultures, maritime identities, display openness, inclusivity, anddynamism  (liberalism) compared to the lumberingcontinental land power identity of closed borders, exclusion and staticsolutions.  And so you have dumb static solutions from stumblingslow-witted jumbos that are expected to work forever, as if circumstances neverever change.Build a Wall. Wall built and the clapping of imaginary dust off tinymanicured hands. “Done and done!” Travel bans and immigration restrictionsbased upon prejudiced views of shithole countries and the illusion of safety.(As if merit based fails to recognize the inherent arrogance of an inherentsuperiority that does not exist in changing environments. And of course we need more soft fat white people to make us look good).I am astounded at the reactionary vision that engages inmagical New Age thinking, wishing the world back to some fantasy paradise throughpositive thinking. Take Steve Bannon back in 2016. Seriously, WTF Steve, a Navy guysupposedly well read in history, espousing a trillion dollar infrastructure planto rebuild “ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up. It will be asexciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution – conservatives, pluspopulists, in an economic nationalist movement”. Might as well build steamlocomotives while we are at it.It’s just as well they didn’t get to light thattrillion dollar bonfire to dance around like some prancing fag at a Superbowl party. This is some seriously fucked up land power retardation.Aerospace is the new maritime (except, with robots… androbot farms, unless you can perfect the centrifugal toilet, the next stepbeyond 2001: A Space Odyssey, and radiation, and the debilitating health effects of low G).China gets it. That’s why they are building stuff on theside of the Moon we cannot see. (Although my brother argues, how do you know wedon’t have that stuff already? Fair point, but we have no long term visionbased on lurching from one administration to the next).Drifted off topic there. The only way the USA doesn’t end upall Planet of the Apes is to return to open, inclusive dynamism and takewhatever the world will give us. If we continue to act like a land power, we willend up like the Soviet Union: birth rates and life expectancy down, alcoholism,drug use and suicides up, infrastructure and military in decay, a politicalsystem  unsteady, corrupt and in chaos, resources,opportunities, and education available to the highest (and/or most dishonest) bidder.Because right now, the rest of the world really doesn’t wantto come to a place that has no balls, so long as we keep on acting like pussyass bitches that hide behind walls."},

{"title": "HBO’s  Confederate Part II", "date": "Tuesday, October 10, 2017", "text": "In the previous essay, I speculated on what would happen if the South Won The Civil War.This was my version of HBO’s upcoming series Confederate. I maintained that :Kurman’s Ironclad Rule of Time Travel  #4:  If the South Wins the Civil War, the Soviet Union becomes the No.1 global superpower.  I failed to entirely explicate that law, and will fail to do so now. Mainly because, being so easily distracted, I’ve come across something much more fun. I’ll get to that in a minute. Let’s set up a few ground rules first.It’s always assumed in counterfactual narrative, that things will regress to the mean, moderation will win out, people, being people, will act in a decent and long term honorable fashion. This is, of course, a foolish assumption. Any casual student of the history of civilization must acknowledge that the praxis of depravity extends all the way back to ancient Sumeria. Call this the Tao of Depravity. Civilization, like water, seeks its lowest point.So, when people assume that if the South wins, or draws, the Civil War, moderation shall be the rule. The divergence will converge to our standards, and we end up with the world as we see it. Slavery will be disposed of. The South will reunify with the North. Sure, and unicorns poop delicious donuts with sprinkles. That's why they have horns. To hold the donuts.If one were to pick important dates in the history of the Republic, one might choose July 4, 1776; or September  17, 1787. I choose a much more important date:  December 14, 1662.On December  14, 1662, the Virginia House of Burgesses codified the civil law rule of partus sequitur ventrem. The offspring follow the condition of the mother. Slave status, caste status, is matrilineal. In other words: mommy’s baby, daddy’s maybe.This salient rule later became incorporated into state laws once the colonies achieved independence from Great Britain. The Virginia Slave Codex is the foundation stone of the United State of America, Don’t let anyone bullshit you otherwise.Okay, basic rules out of the way, on with the masturbations!In the previous essay, I derided the notion that the South could win through a military victory. Quote: “In the Confederacy, by Gettysburg, you have a worthless Confederate paper dollar, Yankee gold coins good anywhere, armed housewives rioting for food, a labor force bled white by conscription, government impressments of private properties”.I rejected that hot mess of that basket case of a victorious South, and that was foolish of me. It’s the perfect fucked-up starting point for an engaging Southern gothic horror show. Silly me. So let’s get to it.Black Friday:  January 1st 1926. In the Confederacy, New Year’s Day is Hiring Day. Once a traditional day for the settling of debts, it was now for the annual buying and selling, or renting, of slaves. It was an occasion for white people to party hard, for drink to flow freely, for feasting and whoring and good times.It was a day for some white men to feel almost equal to other white men. It was a day for legal nonpeoples to fear, a day of uncertainty. Of course, the entire state machinery of the Confederacy had been devoted to erasing this fear, of molding and shaping the minds and bodies of slaves not only to market utility*, but to brute acceptance and docility as would any other kind of livestock.   The breeding factories and laboratories of the Old Dominion of Virginia and the Aristocracy of South Carolina had done their level best to breed for docility of the Negro, but a mere six generations is not enough time to shape people as one would horse or hound. True, the astounding specialized variations produced, with exquisite control of germ lines from the promise of the new science of genetics, had been impressive. But drugs** and operant conditioning of behavioral psychology had been the go-to method of control since the 1880s. Imagine, then the apoplectic rage and visceral astonishment of the Confederacy when a simultaneous and nationwide slave revolt occurred late that afternoon.Not just the craftsmen of the artisan caste, field hands and domestics of the labor caste revolted. The Stock, the Bulls and bucks, ran amok in the feedlots and slaughter houses. Overseers and wranglers torn to pieces, or fed to the machines on the disassembly lines.  Why, even the Mothers resisted. White-suited and silk top-hatted Handlers crushed under the enormous bulk of these mammoth superbreeders and milk producers. How was this possible from creatures of such limited intelligence? Astounding. The international milk brand of Mothers was almost ruined.Fancy Girls*** violently turned upon suitors. Even the Marys and Nancys, those Negresses of the blonde-haired blue-eyed phenotype, participated. Those sex slave lines were discontinued. New germ lines cultivated.On a positive note, only one Little ShadowTM (toys, personal  slave companions) had harmed a master’s child. It was deemed unrelated to the general distress, mentally disturbed, unhinged by a revelation it had been lost in a gambling bet****. It was flayed alive.The rebellion was quickly quashed by that very evening, but the damage was done.  The New York Stock Exchange was in turmoil the next day, overleveraged upon the collateralized debt of human capital. News roiled financial institutions throughout the globe.  It took a month for the markets to calm themselves, and only on the promise from the Confederacy of the strictest scrutinizes and harshest of measures (should fault be found) to be visited upon the stock-raisers of the slave breeding industry. Slave rebellions, and fears of such, were old hat in the South. Slavery is, after all, perpetual war, and vigilance is called for, to the point of accepting the losses of capital from false positives. But the astounding nationwide coordination of this revolt put the Confederacy into a high gear of suppression. If the slave caste was subject to selective breeding, the master caste was certainly bred for sadism and cruelty of the highest order, and one would expect the most extreme response to this rebellion. Extreme being every form of cruel and unusual punishment you can imagine. I also suspect that the US of A’s response to this rebellion was a shrugging of the shoulders as they have their own messes to deal with. Plus, they really wanted to burn Texas oil.The Confederacy, already authoritarian and using decades-old methods similar to gulags and concentration camps, doubled down on becoming a police state. This would prove problematic  in the early 21st century, when the lower  white castes became restive. I’ve run out of time to continue. The source material for this essay - with only a third of the dog-eared pages exploited - is The American Slave Coast – A History of the American Slave Breeding Industry, by Ned and Constance Sublette. Highly readable and thoroughly recommended.Also The Dragon Masters, by Jack Vance."},

Harry Turtledove (Guns of the South, Southern Victoryseries) seems to have claimed a lot of this real estate. He in turn wasinfluenced by MacKinlay Kantor, who wrote a Look magazine article in 1961titled “If the South Had Won The Civil War”. There is Ward Moore’s “Bring TheJubilee”, of a enervated North and an expansive, vibrant South.. Why, even Sir Winston Churchill had a go at it in a 1931essay. Churchill’s is a naively infantile fable. Lee, after  victory at Gettysburg and conquest ofWashington DC, in a “master stroke” frees the slaves, thus gaining GreatBritain as an ally. These authors, and many others, posit some type of militaryvictory that allows the South to secede. They further posit that not only does the South abolishslavery, but there is an eventual reunification with the US of A.Horse. Fucking. Feathers.The standard Pareto wank is a victory at Gettysburg. OrVicksburg. But by then, in 1863, the Union was an enormous military beast thatgave even Great Britain and France pause. Further, Great Britain, havingoutlawed slavery and curtailed the Atlantic trade, had zero confidence thatportions of the South would not renew the Middle Passage slave trade.In the Confederacy, byGettysburg, you have a worthless Confederate paper dollar, Yankee gold coinsgood anywhere, armed housewives rioting for food, a labor force bled white byconscription, government impressments of private properties.That victoriousSouth?  I see it as post-colonial Mexicoat the Mason-Dixon Line. Revolutions, bandits, slave rebellions, low castewhite rebellions, dictatorships… Heck the US of A might have to build a Wall!Perhaps at the end of the fat tail, a King and aristocracyof a Southern Empire, lots of counties and counts in conquested Carribea. Butmaybe not speaking English? Maybe an aggressive Mexico takes shit back? Regardless, not a prosperous Confederacy, and one that hasflown apart. Texas for sure secedes.This military victory divergence I see as almost always aUSA and CSA that is weaker than Epluribus unum.  Fast forward a mere 50 years to WWI. Posit no USA or CSAtroops in WWI because of Isolationism & Continental Antagonism.  Armistice a year earlier, Europe havingpunched itself into a stupor of clarity. I have faith that they all look ateach other and say we really don’t need to do that shit again, ever.  Maybe not, but probably no post-war humiliation ofGermany.Kaiser still there?  Maybe.But Lenin still injected into Russia (great man fallacy? no, nasty man surety)Point is, the Soviet Union is gonna happen. What happens to the USSR with WWIending with a weak Europe and a distant America?...Anyway, the best way for the South to Win the Civil War?Don’t fight the war. These war avoidance divergences almost invariably jonbarhinge upon the Constitutional Convention in 1789. (And maybe even that is toolate to fix). But the fallacy is the Great Man theory. Lincoln is killed in acarriage accident in 1859 type of stuff. Problem is the passions are alreadyriled. If you can’t fat-tail your way to an amicable secession in 1789, you aregonna have some kind of war.Is that actually true? I’m making this shit up. It soundsright to me. So, the Constitution loses the signatories of Virginia ondown. The US of A starts with 8colonies. (I’m figuring Maryland goes with the Southern Colonies).Certainties? Yankee ingenuity. The lowly mechanicks makecotton gins, standardized parts, firearms... Southern planters, averse to paying for anything, develop one of the finest industrial espionage networks ever. White people, immigrant andestablished, reproducing at biological maximum. Genocide. Maybe not as bad asour USA, or perhaps worse.  A continentalexpansion is inevitable, and maybe a race through the Southwest. Also, with slavery,immense Southern wealth: a system of global credit through capitalized chattelownership, a collateralized debt system with human commodities. People aremoney. (Kind of like what we have now, but more depraved).Speaking of depravity, I think for an honest andcomprehensive counterfactual, we need to plumb the depths of depravity,especially when it comes to corporate culture, and the lack of moralstherefrom.   We can discuss the horror of slavery, but slaves are born ofwoman. The weaponized womb . Well no wrong, womb was weaponized from the get-go.The capitalized womb? The collatoralized and commodified womb? That’s  an ancient and still modern horror.Consider, old Tom Jefferson. Smart fucker. Took advantage ofthat constitutionally stipulated deadline of January 1, 1808, when the“importation of persons” is prohibited. Article 1, Section 9. The slave tradeofficially goes domestic. Meaning southern slave breeders, I mean the genteelsouthern planter caste, gets to make a shit ton of money, especially ol’ TJ. (Too bad he blows  it all on Monticello).Jefferson kept and bred slaves as he would horse or hound.But what about his wife? He loved her deeply and dearly, and he bred her todeath. He fucked her to death. That’s a fucking horror show.Slaves allowed the vote in 1869; women, 1920.Which gets us to the real meat of a good Southern gothic alternatehistory horror story, which is what you want.  Once you posit a less chastened South, free toexperiment in the breeding of human livestock, backed by modern scientificmethods and corporate deep pockets, we move beyond a caste system into meatlogistics. I present to you the blaxploitation movie Mandingo, which,it wasn’t a good movie, but the original book - of a fictional breeding farm inthe South called, of all things, Falconhurst - created a genre I’m calling thecuck and bull genre.  Fifteen sequelsfrom different authors.  A Broadway playand two movies. I think that is the most realistic version of a 21stcentury Confederate slave industry.Were there breeding farms in the South? Yes and no. Not likecorporate shit. Not like multinational conglomerate level shit. But if slaverycontinues in the South, and slavery meets the modern corporate structure, and modern science, yougot depraved sex farms. You got rape factories too, but you call them somethingelse, something more polite, courteous and genteel.  And then there’s the meat industry. There is really no lowbar for how degraded one can make human flesh. If you can breed them into arecognized subhumanity? Bred like roaster chickens for maximum yield? Sure, why not.?And of course, once human chattel is no longer consideredhuman, but livestock, new dietary horizons open up. Good old industrialcannibalism.  I wonder, since depravityseems to degrade everyone, would this grisly practice be restricted to theSouth? You don’t suppose the Chicago meatpackers would want to get in on themoney? Would negroes be processed in an even more horrific version of UptonSinclair’s The Jungle?Sure, why not?Oh, geez, I got sidetracked on the Soviet Unionthing didn't I? Here:"},
{"title": "No Junk. No Noise.", "date": "Tuesday, June 6, 2017", "text": "It has been reported that CRISPR/Cas9 may cause unintended mutations. Perhaps hundreds of Off Target mutations. There are, naturally, already objections to the study that resulted in this report.I for one, would not be at all surprised that Nature Bites Back when a not entirely understood method is applied.Like the old Jewish proverb: Man Plans, God Laughs.Happens all the time with much simpler and more readily understood technologies. And when applied to the ultimate carbon-based nanotechnology, the Wholly Grail of Protean Tech, with complex, tightly coupled, kluge-ridden infrastructure, one should expect the machine to do what it is already set up to do, rather than what we intend. And honestly, when you've a fractal information storage system, with levels of scale effecting each from the smallest to the largest, why the fuck would anyone be at all surprised by a global reaction? After all, it was only a few years ago that biologists though whole domains of the genome were just junk, and now it is turning out that the junk is, well, not entirely junk. Repurpose, recycle, reuse on steroids, more like.Reminds me of an article I read in Nautilus magazine a number of years ago. I searched in vain here in my memory palace to find it. Ah, but good old serendipity, Nautilus republished an updated  version: Nature, The IT Wizard.  This article caused me to come up with the term suzammenbindenkugel - the self-reinforcing holistic bubble. I still like the term, hearkening as it does to my Teutonic roots, back when Germany was the most advanced scientific nation on Earth, before it decided to eat its own limbs for fifty years.The gist of the article is how blazingly efficient all of these incredibly messy molecules and structures we call Life are, bumping right up against the mathematical limits of efficiency. Why if our poor fire ape technology of metal, ceramic, and crystalline doohickeys  were just a fraction of this, we'd at least have a Solar System striding empire by now. Or a smoke enshrouded hell world. Or something.The takeaway I got from this article was noise in the brain. Recent news reveals that neurons are not simply on/off transistors, that regions within the neurons, the dendrites for example, perform highly complex calculations that determine neuronal behavior. And, it turns out there are even bigger slow coherent oscillations within the brain that propagate to connect neurons in distant parts of the brain. We thought this was just noise, but no. (Throw in the incredible system of astrocytes and, of course, the gut brain, and all that cutting edge neural networks like Google DeepMind look risibly unsophisticated and downright primitive, no?)So, we have junk that ain't junk and noise that ain't noise, and it was just our ignorance all along, go figure.Which makes me wonder about the latest technique in deep cranial stimulation: a method that can electrically stimulate deep structures within the brain without implanting electrodes via surgical intervention. Sounds like they've stumbled upon a technique the brain already uses. And I wonder what unintended side effect this will have?"},

The pay is a lot better. Unfortunately, I lost my pimped out studio when I quit my job as studio tech. (I also inadvertently lost my gig as Bronze Casting instructor, but that's another story).I still managed to get some stuff cast. Partly through the gracious intervention of the new Bronze Casting instructor, Philip Spangler, whom I helped familiarize with the Harper CE bronze program, and who reciporcated by allowing me to throw my stuff into the Spring semester mix.Partly through my own efforts casting coffee can investment molds at Chris Newman studios using my mini-melter Mark II.Now, I have a new gig at CIADC in Rogers Park, as Casting Department manager and instructor of metal casting. I'll provide more info on that as time allows. I'll be casting over there for the foreseeable future.Anyway, the latest series is called Holiday Snaps. It is a series of creatures in relaxed vacation poses. Not sure what kind of creatures. Some clay ladies at the college exclaimed they were elves when I was working on them. Sure, why not? If you want a more intricate bullshit narrative, they are Icelandic hothouse elves, perhaps mutated by deep magma reservoir geothermal waters used to heat the greenhouses. Or perhaps they are natural denizens of the deep mantle come to call Iceland home.In any case, I'm pretty sure rendering them was a case of cryptomnesia, as I came across a Rene Magritte painting that I'd seen before and no doubt unconsciously copied:Les merveilles de la nature, 1953These are 1/12th scale figures in bronze, cast in Dec. 2016/April 2017. Holiday Snaps #1Holiday Snaps #2Holiday Snaps #4Holiday Snaps #5Holiday Snaps #6Holiday Snaps #7Holiday Snaps #8Holiday Snaps #9Holiday Snaps #10Holiday Snaps #11Holiday Snaps #12What happened to #3 you might ask?

I figured I would get in one more post before the arbitrary turn of the wheel.As you all know, there's really no reason to be optimistic considering, like the therapsids of the early Triassic, we suffer from the illusion of survival. It doesn't mean we are doomed in the coming year. We have always been doomed.But have no fear. No Strangelovian happy ending in 2017. We will continue our half-assed incompetent muddling well into 2020.We are officially in the Age of the Archosaur. Many thought we were going to be the dominant therapsid in the Anthropocene, but then we fucked it all up. True, it sure seems like things are looking up for some folks out there, but no, doom is all we have going for us. What with the final pussification of America complete. The right* (alt- and cis- and trans-) correctly identifying themselves as cuckservatives, realizing they are not true men anymore, Homo Domesticus, frail little waifs compared to our sturdy virile ancestors of 12,000 years ago. The last reserves of fossil oxygen pretty much used up, while we dither over incredibly plentiful fossil carbon. Soylent Green over budget and behind schedule.Which of course puts me in a jolly semi-nihilistic mood. Eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die!Because, of course, we are in the aftermath of the Collapse. And when did the Collapse (meaning the Anthropocene) occur?Some will argue the first atomic bomb was the golden spike, 1945. Others argue for 1610, when the Little Ice Age got going after Pangaea was restitched together, and the partially-inadvertent slaughter of 50 million North Americans resulted in a huge carbon sequestration. Others choose the year 1950, when the Great Acceleration started, and we ape-shaped ants started to really dominate the biosphere. Some will opt for 9,000 years ago, when the first monkey hives were mud-pied together. Others will go all the way back to 300,000 years ago, with the arrival of anatomically modern humans.But, just so you are aware, the Collapse happened on March 23, 1978. More specifically, 11:11 am.Is this an arbitrary date and time? No and yes. It was, under many metrics, the apex of human civilization. It was when the (not yet classified) .01% headed for the life boats, and said fuck everybody else. It was when we went from class to caste warfare. And the poster child for the Collapse is Ronald Reagan. You cannot find a more archetypical archosaur than Ronald Wilson Reagan.Why am I picking on Ol' Snoozy? He wasn't even in office yet. True, but Reagan, of all people, championed jolly nihilism. Here we had a chance to be adult about our circumstances. Say, what you will about Carter, he admonished us into acting like adults. But no, Reagan told us to go out and play, and we did.Which of course, at this stage, is as good as any coping strategy.Can't help but think that the really big Great Filter is an all-or-nothing affair. And (in the case of us ape-shaped ants) requires that we have to wreck the planet. We either get to that magic carrying capacity for the Singularity of ten billion brains or we fuck it all up and finally quit grabbing Mother Earth by the pussy.But that's all just a tail-end distribution bleeding probability into a nonexistent mean.See you next year!"},

It's all tragedy or triumph. And from ten feet up, just like the election of Obama, and W before him, and Clinton before him and so on and back. And I see exactly zero of the elites shivering in their boots.The normalized mythos is that people wanted change, and that's almost true. People wanted things to change, just not in a forwards direction. The expressed opinions of Trump supporters I have talked to - and those in Hoosierland are legion - is that they would have voted for Captain Kangaroo if he had run. Trump was irrelevant. Trump was a buffoon. But Trump was not Hillary. Worse still fro Trump, he was consistently recognized as someone who will probably fuck the country up, but they voted for him anyway. They knew they were bullshitted. So, Trump a genius? Sure, at bullshitting. A bullshitter is someone who lies to your face, knows it's a lie, knows you know its a lie, but does it anyway. Trump supporters are not stupid, and they have no illusions that the elites have been dislodged, nor that Trump is going to look out for them. Let's move to one hundred feet up. The press interview after Trump's personal meeting with Obama showed a very nervous Trump. Nervous? Hell. Trump was terrified. I suspect the poor old codger actually squirted a stain into his Depends. Some various scenarios for the reaction are:1) Obama showed Trump The Film - the JFK assassination film which basically informs all presidents that that there are some  puppet strings they should never pull back on. (My take? Entertaining but unlikely).2) Obama took Trump to the woodshed, and basically laid out how, if Trump thought he was humiliated at the Press Corp dinner in 2011? A humiliation that will burn Trump's ears for the rest of his life? That was just a gentle cuffing. Wait until he assumes the office of president, and experiences constant daily, sometimes hourly, humiliations from just the brutal reality surrounding the office. (Again, entertaining, and certainly somewhat likely, but not sufficient).3) Trump was introduced representatives of the Oligarchy, and found out you need to be a trillionaire to be in the club, and he ain't in the club, won't be in the club, so suck on that, little man. (Again, entertaining, but unlikely).4) We are ruled by evil aliens since 1947. (Not all that entertaining, but cannot be ruled out).5) Ah, well, for 5) we have to ascend to a thousand feet or higher.Consider the following facts.Item: Trump was elected by 25% of the vote. Hillary 26%. None of the Above 49%. 90 million eligible voters did not give a fuck. Hardly a takedown, is it? The majority of American voters have not voted in elections since 1960. Americans have been cynically apathetic since at least 1960. They perceive themselves as fatalistic and essentially powerless, and  that's even before the coup d'etat of '63. It's only the deranged extremists who think they drive the car.Entertaining Ironic Aside Item: The United States of America is the Milton Berle of superpowers. (background, Milton Berle purportedly had a massive cock, and had to show it off as often as possible to anyone he could get to look at it). Meaning: the US of A has the biggest dick on the planet, and is still insecure about it.Item: A 2015 gallup poll found that 72% of Americans expressed confidence in the US military. 33% in the Presidency. 32% in the Supreme Court. 31% with confidence in pubic schools. 23% with confidence in the criminal justice system. 8% confidence in Congress. These numbers have all been in steady decline since 1960. Americans have, since forever, said the country is going in the wrong direction. Whiners? Or more clear sighted than the average dipshit pundit wants to give them credit for?The fact is, even after the steady dismantling of FDR's Big Government paternalism, the US military is, ironically, the last vestige of FDR's system. It is the substitute welfare state. I hypothesize that this is due to the fact that the US of A is a failed state. Oh, true, it's not like present day Venezuela, not like late '80s Soviet scarcity. It's a different type of failed state.American foreign policy has been forced to see everything as a nail, as the military hammer is the only tool remaining in the tool belt. And how well has that worked? Nation building has been a disaster. I would submit that a large part of the disaster consists of American trying to the do the right thing. (The right thing being making people behave just like us). We are a big friendly bumbling giant that, after oops did I crush your house? Let me fix that, and proceed to wreck the whole town. We'd have done better to go in, kick ass, and leave the wreckage and rubble to them to rebuild as they saw fit, rather the Pottery Barn approach to foreign policy.Which takes to the international community and its effort to mitigate all the problems, including addressing failed states. And the evidence is? The international community is itself a failed state. The economy? System D, a fucked up network of criminal venality, is approaching 70% of the world economy. Again, failed institutions.    Quite frankly, this period looks exactly like the Period of Warring States in China, the aftermath of the Romans, the failed states of every single regime change we see throughout history. We are in, what year 14? or year  72? Year 118 of the Forever War? A war that is increasingly unrestricted? Not contained within the usual jus in bello restraints?   Well, fear not. The Forever War can't, due to carrying capacity, last forever.Let's shoot up to a million feet. Too many people, wanting too much stuff, using up more of the land and resources, and pumping way too much shit out. Shit in every form and fancy. 60% of the coral reefs gone. 90% of fish stock gone. 90% of all life lives in the ocean, and between global warming and ocean acidification we are looking at an Eocene/Miocene extinction event in 40 years times, probably less. Drama queen spaz antics on my part? Sure, if I'm wrong. Bet you I'm not.Sport fish trophies today, and even worse, this man has no Y chromosome due to endocrine disruptorsEven then, these were tiny fish compared to 1000 years agoBecause here's the deal. the thing that Obama told Trump is: we've already collapsed.Let me repeat this for all the corpse-licking knuckleheads who nuzzle their grisly muzzles into the sticky rotting crevasses of the world corpse, the people who see Mad Max as exciting!, the people who choose to ignore those parts of our collapse that are not to their liking, the people who fap to Armageddon, the people who make smarmy remarks about \"rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic\". Titanic done sunk, chumps. It's life boats from here on out. And the job of those goons and stooges of the .01% is to make sure to break the hands and heads of those 99.99% desperately clinging to the life rafts. The .01% are quite frankly terrified of the mob only because they fear the lifeboat being swamped, but as far as life goes, you, me, your kids, my loved ones, we are all expendable to them. Fuckers.They hire the likes of W and Obama and Trump and REagan and Nixon, and we can't. They will keep us out of the life boats.To parahpase Bruce Sterling, the collapse is here. It's just not evenly distributed. Yet.Now, a billion feet up. Is it too late? It's never too late. Too late for us and ours, yes. But maybe not so much a for far future generation. Because we are just ape-shaped bugs after all, there is a good chance that we have moved out of the Stability regime and moved into Swarm.There's a chance.

Although, one job I lose as of Dec.12th, the Bronze Casting Instructor job. But I may gain a new job in January as a Moldmaking Instructor.I have the Welding Instructor job at Harper.I have the Bronze Casting Instructor job at Harper*.I am a sculptor's assistant on the weekends.As of today, I am a part-time keyholder with Rockler Woodworking and Hardware.Exciting times ahead. The Rockler and welding instructor jobs mesh well, as I have to learn CAD/CAM and CNC for both jobs. Rockler has CNC woodworking lathes and also has Shopbots which I must teach classes on and do demos. Harper CPT has CNC plasma cutters, CNC laser cutters, robot milling machines, robot punch machines and, well, all the cool late-20th-century automated machinery.I'm a lucky guy.I still make art, crafting small waxes and casting them in coffee can molds, and I will continue to do that. That all has to happen late at night. I considered joining a Hacker space called Pumping Station One (yeah, not a good name). Toured the place, plunked down $40 for a month's membership, came in a few times, and found that territories had already been carved out there, and I really didn't feel like stepping on toes or stealing thunder. It's basically summer camp for rich yuppies and geeks, with all these kinds of generally shallow and trivially crafty projects involving very expensive equipment. Plus, you had to get 'authorized' on the equipment, and the authorization sessions are at the end of the month. Pass.

Wherever Hubris is, Nemesis is sure to follow.After teaching class last night, I came home and watched The Big Short - the movie about the housing crisis and financial collapse. Actually, I worked on waxes first, until about midnight, then I watched the movie. I chose that order knowing that the movie would make me mad. It didn't. It made me sad. But I was right that I would be in no mood to work on waxes after watching it.So, and the lesson of that movie is that almost all business is on Wall street is fraudulent and criminal, driven by greed and stupidity. The Scandinavian in me would just as soon slaughter all the those bankers (after slow torture), mount their heads on pikes throughout Manhattan, as an object lesson to other white collar criminals. The Scandinavian in me knows this would do no damn good at all, but it might make a few people feel better. I still maintain white collar crime should carry a mandatory death penalty.In any case, the observation at the end of the movie, that the financial crisis would be blamed upon immigrants and poor people, was spot on. I look at the Crash of 2008 as not unlike WWI in Germany. The successful popular opinion - authored by the loathsome incompetent that lost the war for Germany, Erich Ludendorff - was that the military would have won the war if they had not been stabbed in the back by Jews and Commies.This lie was successfully promulgated among the German people, and the result was WWII. So, Crash of 2008 Part Deux is coming up because the same creeps that gave us Part Un are still in charge, and have successfully promulgated the big lie that Wall street was stabbed in the back by guvmint, immigrants, and poor people. Interesting thing about that cat Ludendorff. He successfully fought a battle against Czarist Russia, Tannenberg, that probably cost Germany the war. Hubris. Followed by Nemesis.So, given that the economy is destined to take a shit, and probably sooner rather than later means I'm in no hurry to go hide in a 40-hour-a-week, 9-to-5 stable job because it won't be there very soon.

Volunteering my knowledge and skills may be just the right kind of karma I need right now. Networking and all that.I also plan on touring Chicago Industrial Arts and Design Center during their open house.

Vigantopus noticed she had no home, and kindly invited her to stay within her. The woman had just enough room inside Vigantopus to sleep in a fetal position. Vigantopus did not eat her, though she could have. As the woman slept, Vigantopus roamed the countryside, sometimes travelling scores of miles in one night. With eight limbs to move upon, the woman never felt a lurch or a sway. She would wake up and tumble out into places she had never been, not knowing where she was."},

Still maintaining the same weird shit that I do, just smaller.The one piece of art advice I hand out to students - and I generally don't give out advice - is \"If it makes you uncomfortable, pursue it\". Students often accuse me of copping out because I refuse to advise them re: a vision or aesthetic pursuit. I'm more than happy to instruct them in technical aspects. My rationalization for not offering further advice is \"Well, it's YOUR fucking art. If you want to make MY fucking art, I'll tell you what to do\".I actually don't follow my advice all often. But, in class last week, I showed a technique to two of my younger female students, and they ran with it. Another student asked me \"Aren't you afraid they are getting out of hand with that? Making a mess and all?\" I replied, \"Hey I just make monsters. I don't control them\".Lately, I've been staying up late to the wee hours of the morn making wax monsters and people. I'll sit there with an arrangement of pre-cast wax parts, mix and match, and when something makes me go \"Huh\" or \"Ick\", then I'll head down that path.

{"title": "The Great Big Book Of Horrible Things: A Book Report", "date": "Monday, September 26, 2016", "text": "The Great Big Book Of Horrible Things: The Definitive Chronicle of History's Worst Atrocities by Matthew White. My brother has this book in his bathroom. I got it from the library. I suggest that you buy it.White walks through, in chronological order, the recorded kilodeaths and megadeaths that humanity has inflicted upon itself. It would be very easy to be cynical about this, and the antidote for cynicism is a morbid sense of humor. White possesses this. Not quite as developed a sense of humor as James Mahaffey, but it will suffice.I could sample and excerpt some of the more awful things (like, for example, the peculiar Chinese execution practice of death by slicing), but instead let us look at his criteria (explained at the end of the book), and then also some of his general observations.Upon finishing this book, I observed to my brother \"We're just ants aren't we?\"Fire ants or crazy ants, it really doesn't matter, but from the historical perspective of 10,000 feet up, yup, we're just ants. Bugs. Ape-shaped bugs. You would think, with big primate brains acting in the aggregate, that we'd be smarter, but nope. There seems to be a limit to, or a cyclical referent to, the sophistication collective behaviors, and as such it makes me hold no great hopes for the coming hyper-neural network collective of hyperintelligent computers and the great Global Hive Mind. Megadeaths? Gigadeaths, or given a colonizing push out into space, teradeaths.But you have to have a sense of humor about it. Couple of things. Anyone who ends up with the title \"the Great\" murdered a lot of people to earn that title.  Oh, wait sorry, criteria.In order to make it into the book:1) there has to be an immediate or closely followed death toll above 300K2) a result of a specific outbreak of coordinated human violence and coercion3) deaths can be direct (war, murder, execution) and indirect (aggravated disease, famine, accidental or incidental killings of civilians).That's it. Quibble if you want, or write your own book.Worse guy in history? Hitler*, of course. Or sure, Stalin was a monster, Mao, Pol Pot, etc. Alexander the Great was an asshole, along with Napoleon, Timur, Qin Shi Huang Di, etc. But Hitler deliberately and calculatedly did what he did in a way no one else has come close to doing... yet.Badasses of history? Hardly killed anyone. Vikings, Huns, Samurai, Sikhs, Spartans, all light weights. You know who tops the list in multicides? The French. Yes, those cheese-eating surrender monkeys. Followed by the Chinese, the British, Russians, Germans, Americans. America better get cracking.Terrorism. A problem? Small potatoes. To really kill a lot of people apparently requires the appartus of the state. Want to see a lot of deaths? Declare war on terrorism.Justice? Most asshole dictators die comfortably in bed.Sieges kill more people than battles do.In war, civilians die more often than military. Want to be safe in war? Surround yourself with an army.Chaos kills more often than tyranny. Failed states and the breakdown of authority account for more mulitcides than abuse of authority.Religion kills? I got news for you, people were being nasty to each other long before religion came along. Percent of total human suffering caused by religious wars and persecutions? 10%. Or about the same as atheists have done. Take that, Richard Dawkins.Hereditary monarchs are usually too inbred stupid to cause much trouble. If you want to get truly talented murderers to do a proper job, set up a meritocracy.Guerrilla war. No state has ever managed to come up with a solution of organized versus irregular militia. It seems the only solution to insurgents is to set up a competing guerrilla band and let them hunt each other. (Lesson that municipalities learned in dealing with gang violence, perhaps???)Finally, if you want to look at the illusion of progress (*cough* Pinker! *cough*), keep in mind that the 20th century was the bloodiest ever. White goes so far as to come up with a neologism to describe it: The Hemoclysm, the blood flood. 150 million dead. Well, fear not, this century is early. Maybe we'll have a new term by the end: The Coproclysm.Hi ho!"},

Acquaintance of mine that works there said it took her tow months before she was hired on permanently. I can't wait two months.So, bit of a rough patch so far, but I've been through worse. Besides, the weather has been gorgeous and I've got my health. I've been going for long bike rides to get my mind of a lack of employment, and they have been fantastic. Hey, why not go for long bike rides, as opposed to sitting and moping, or uselessly churning out resumes at the local library?As for my health, why, it's been a year and two weeks since I had my nephrectomy, and I'm almost back to looking like Tarzan. I've not neglected exercise, my strength has improved, and I almost have a flat alligator belly... almost. Actually, I will never have a flat alligator belly again, but I've got the closest a near-sexagenarian can get without dangerous drugs and pills.(Two meals a day helps with the slimming. Not that I lack for money, just don't find myself particularly hungry for lunch).On the plus side, it looks like I will be adjunct faculty teaching welding for CTP division at Harper College for the last 8 week session of this semester. Speaking of which, I got a free pass through CPT to go to the IMTS2016 at McCormick Place.  IMTS (International Manufacturing Technology Show) is a biannual tech show with the latest innovations.When I walked in to the east hall, I saw a sea of robot arms flailing and gesturing literally almost to the horizon. This was the CAD/CAM section of the show. I also looked at metal cutting and grinding machines (things that could cut through M1A1 Abrams tanks with little difficulty), CNC mills, and well, no I didn't make it to the tooling hall. I should have but I didn't have time.Oh, I checked out all the additive tech. 3D printers, and such. I picked up a tantalum goblet that looked like Jesus used it, and it was a good 20 lbs.I saw a giant robot arm made by FANUC that was flipping a Porsche like a burger. I saw the world's largest horizontal mill by Toyoda that was the size of of a locomotive. I saw CNC machines that ground out a two foot Statue of Liberty, a Leaning Tower of Pisa, and some of the ugliest chrome art you have ever seen. I handed out my card to anyone that would take it, and pitched the idea of me being their corporate artist-in-residence (politely and tactfully not pointing out that their CNC art pieces were very tacky and gaudy). A guy from a Beijing company seemed fairly enthusiastic, which means their gonna steal all my stuff.The one thing I thought about is why robot arms? I mean, it is obvious why. We are apes with arms. If we were giant crabs or ants or octopuses, we'd have robot mandibles and tentacles. But still, there must be tasks where robot tentacles or mandibles would be functionally better, but you don't see them,I figure it's a result of being cyborg apes. (Yes, honey-bunses, we are cyborgs, going back a long, long time. A monkey with a stick is a cyborg. True, a crude one, but a cyborg nonetheless).I figure it's a problem similar to the one shamans experience. An (imaginary) animal familiar or spirit guide. Is it an extension of the personality, or an independent ally? I remember in Norse myth, Odin had two ravens, Hugin (thought) and Munin (desire), that would fly around the world and come back  and whisper in his ear, and keep him up to date on current events. Odin always knew that Hugin would return, but sometimes worried that Munin would not. Was he worried that a part of himself would not return? Maybe.Probably what I would worry about if I had a robot arm."},

I just observed and nodded and said \"Cool!\" a lot. I'm smart enough not to be know-it-all smart-ass in interviews.I did get weird looks. I mean, I am the oldest guy by decades in that establishment. Most of them are kid artists right out of grad school. They also had to figure, from looking at my resume, why the hell do you want to start here at the ground floor.Well, that's easy enough. I'm awesome, they're awesome, and I wish to add my awesomeness to the mix. Given the high turnover with the disenchanted millennials, I could be Uncle John before you know it. And I'm pretty sure they need an Uncle John. Not an authority figure Uncle John, but a step-in-to-any-position-and-get-the-job-done Uncle John. We'll see if their vision corresponds with mine.So, Thursday, my first day, and I am assigned to bottom-feeder gate-cutting and rough grinding of pieces straight from the foundry. This is a dirty, sweaty job involving hammering off ceramic shell, heavy lifting, and lots of cutting through inches thick  bronze with a right angle grinder with a cutoff wheel. I have to admit, after an hour, I said maybe I'm not cut out for this. But then I got into the swing of things, and tried my best to kick major ass.It was actually fun, and kind of relaxing. I worked smart, lifted and hammered smart, and only pinched my fingers and thumbs once or twice, I could tell this job would mean I don't need to go to the gym quite as often. Felt stronger and endorphin-pumped by the end of the day.The only problem was the dust and metal fines. They gave me a respirator, and I brought my own grinding gear, but my neck was unprotected.  I suffered from the itchy prickly heat for a day afterwards. A little Benadryl spray took care of that, but I need to get better clothing. If they intend to keep me on in rough grinding, I need to go full gimp mode and get completely covered. I need to get some face hoods in the long run, and a long-sleeved cotton turtle neck for the short run.I don't know what management thought about my performance, but hopefully I made a good impression."},
{"title": "Cannibalism - A Lot More Common Than We Are Comfortable In Admitting", "date": "Tuesday, August 30, 2016", "text": "Cannibalism is a time-honored tradition practiced by all animals. In times of famine, mothers eat their young. In times of plenty, mothers eat their young. Look at the archaeological record of our and related hominid species, and you will find lots of cut marks in bones, lots of carbonization from cooking fires.We have been inculcated in the value system that cannibalism is morally repugnant, and yet, that really hasn't stopped the practice altogether.In the West, with the arrival of the Enlightenment and the Protestant Reformation, we have divided the world into Christian and Cannibal: Civilization and Savagery. (Please ignore the fact that the fundamental sacred ritual of Christianity involves the consumption of  flesh and blood). The idea, you see, is that the liberal notions of individual dignity somehow preclude from sane or rational behavior the idea of eating each other.Of course, we still practice cannibalism, but we do it in the marketplace. People, as useful commodities, are consumed. Labor and ingenuity are extracted from them as soon as is useful. People have value right up until they cease being productive. Children, of course, as future labor resources, are treated as valued objects. (Although, with the coming biotech revolution, newborns and fetuses will no doubt be put to work as well).None of this, of course, is new, but I think the marketing strategy for modern denial of modern cannibalism is fairly modern (and by modern, I mean in the past 500 years? since the advent of globalization)."},
{"title": "Briefly.", "date": "Monday, August 22, 2016", "text": "I'm thinking about cybernetics a lot lately, and more specifically about how so many systems I observe can be interpreted as neural networks, neural network simulations run on quantum computers, and even more specifically, about Ross Ashby's version of this form of cybernetics... which sounds suspiciously like the state equations of quantum mechanics.Customer relations at the counter, traffic flow to and from work, just in time inventories at the temp jobs, the information arbitrage of contractors and in-house added value services, \"I know a guy that knows a guy\" type of stuff all look a lot like a neural network in continuous cycle.W. Ross Ashby, creator of the homeostat, when talking about cybernetic systems, often made the point that the environment is an active participant in the feedback loop. Well, that's obvious.A lumberjack chopping down a tree can't do much without the tree, But is the tree an active participant? Ross would say yes. The lumberjack observes:orients:decides:acts based upon the attributes of the tree. He modifies his axes swings based upon the chunks that fly out. The tree is not going to drop chunks exactly the same each time. There is contingency involved. He modifies his swings and positions when it looks like the tree is about to come down. Don't want to have the tree fall on you, so yes, the tree, the environment is an active participant, adding that fun little nonlinear enhancement to the feedback loop.(This is what butthole social Darwinists ignore that their peril: innate virtues involved in fitness are less than half the equation, Only the fittest survive for that environment. As the environment acts upon the actions of the individuals, so one can, in a fitness seascape, make the right choice at the right time from position of the right circumstance, and end up at the bottom of the trough from the crest of the wave. WIPE OUT!)Which makes me think (and I've said this many times before) that intelligence as a property isn't really real; any more than cold is real, or dark is real. Intelligence is the absence of stupidity, just as cold is the absence of heat. As such, there is no such thing as a competely stupid person. Actually, there is, but under the demands of our particular universe, completely stupid is completely dead.On the obverse, no one is completely smart. We are, of course, compartmentally smart, or rather, compartmentally stupid.Some people have a whole houseful of smart, and just a closet of stupid, while others... the opposite.We obviously utilize that. One can have only a closet full of smart and a house full of stupid, but by interacting with others, using the ultrasocial network we ape-shaped bugs have developed, take advantage of others who are not so stupid.I do it both ways all the time. I, in fact, know given my current circumstances, that there are some not so stupids out there looking out for me, which is why I landed this temp job,and also why I have an interview with an art foundry.If it wasn't so nice, I'd probably be paranoid."},
{"title": "Temp Job", "date": "Saturday, August 20, 2016", "text": "I got a temp job working behind the counter at a retail metal outlet. It's a franchise where you can buy metal. I haven't done counter work since college.I've been working there for three weeks, and so far, out of the hundreds of customers I've dealt with, I've only had to deal with two assholes.That's pretty good.The guys I work with are all good guys, and the boss has asked me to fill in when needed, as he considers me \"a good fit\".  Well, I try to be patient, polite, considerate and helpful, and I guess that's what you have to be if you are a counter guy. Everyone is in a hurry, needs instant gratification, but I've been told to just relax and not let them rush you. That advice came from Phil, the other counter guy.  Phil pretty much runs the day to day operations, so classify him as non-com, staff sergeant. Phi's a good guy, funny guy; therefore, smart guy. Interesting character, like most people I've dealt with since working there.The one most recent asshole customer I would classify as a pufferfish, an angry pissy little empty shitbag.He likes to threaten. Threats are illogical.If this were a samurai movie, he's the scared little shopkeeper constantly worried that he will lose his small piece of capital. He threatens and bullies the underlings, but if anyone stands up to him he collapses. And he toadies to superiors. It doesn't help he has that whiny nasal south side of Chicago dialect that makes me want to punch him in the face.I'm of an age now where I really don't have the time and patience to put up with people's shit. So when it got to the point where he was just too much of a whiny little bitch, and I knew I was going to tell him to fuck off, I turned him over to Phil.Phil is a pro, and had the guy settled down in about fifteen seconds. After Phil got off the phone, he laughs and say \"I could see the smoke coming out of your ears\".He was right about that.We have also had a ton of people who are just really good, really colorful characters.I had one middle-aged black woman come in wanting to buy an 8\" x 10\" plate of inch thick steel, because she had to go do business on the south side. I discouraged her from buying it. It would have weighed, like, 40 lbs. Actually, I pretty much treated her like she was my mom, as gently and compassionately as I could. She was from Evanston, which, like progressive Oak Park, is pretty well integrated. (Chicago, third after Milwaukee and New York City, is a severely segregated, physically walled off racist city). Rather than try to assuage her fears, I googled a bunch of places where she could buy a protective vest.A lot of the white guy customers are bigots. I was uncomfortable with some of the things I heard.Well, this is America, and you are allowed to express your opinions.I just figure these bigot types are limited, because by limiting their behavior according to stereotypes, they cut way down on their options and opportunities in dealing with people. I also have to assume they feel they are in a private space where they can vent, and perhaps outside of this cracker barrel venue, they treat others differently than how they express themselves.The vast majority of the customers are skilled laborers, machinists, fabricators, etc. What those gentleman snobs the Founding Fathers would have considered \"lowly mechanicks\". Possessors of only mere skills, labor, and ingenuity, and not proper men of property.The Founding Fathers were assholes.It's amazing how, despite the enfranchisement of so many into our supposed democracy, there is stilla stigma attached to working with your hands. These people, of course, have my utmost respect. They know so many things about bending material instrumentality to their will I am quite frankly in awe. The stories they tell sound braggadocious and triumphal, but they are really problem:action: result stories. I know that, should civilization as we know it end tomorrow, these guys are guys you want to hang out with.That's about it. I have two interviews next week. One at a art foundry, the other at a furniture fabrication place. I'll let you know how it goes."},

{"title": "You'll Find Not Much A or I in AI", "date": "Thursday, July 21, 2016", "text": "So, reading through The Gunning of America, I've already decided not to do a book report on it, other than to suggest it is a good summer read.... though perhaps not today, what with the heat index in the 100s.Quickly, the book is about how America's gun culture had to be created. The gun used to be just an every day object like a rake or a hammer. The market demand wasn't there, and it took advertisers and marketers to create the gun market we have today. They make it an object of glamour, one that we fetishize and fantasize and accessorize, new and improved, etc. And it was all due to the Industrial Revolution. Used to be, you want a gun, you go to a gunsmith, make known your wishes, come back in a month. If some wandering salesman tried to interest you in a new and improved gun, you'd probably say, but I already have a gun. This shoots more bullets faster, the salesman might say. Well, that's just crazy, you'd reply. I only need it to shoot one bullet at a time. Anything more is a waste of bullets. And the salesman would go away.What I'd rather talk about is two things that I've been thinking about, and that the book peripherally deals with.The first thing is that the Constitution was written prior to the Industrial Revolution, and it shows.That 2nd amendment doesn't mean what it originally meant, and we've had to deal with that, and the way we've decided to deal with it is through denial. Most people have always recognized firearms as really nothing more than implements of slaughter. Some people have a hard time with that. They make up rationalizations about how careful, adult, and mature they are with these things, but they refuse to allow chaos, accident, lapse of judgement,  and random chance into their equation of usage.The least that any 2A proponent (if they are honest, and I am) is admit that to continue the maximum freedom implicit in the 2nd amendment, many small innocents - most especially children - must be sacrificed on the altar of the gun.And the second thing is, the Industrial Revolution (IR) took all the fun out of everything.Now, let's be clear, the IR has been going on for 10,000 years at least. We call it Civilization, but finally it's obvious that the S curve which represents market saturation of this method is making it's way into every human endeavor.Go back far enough, and you still find interchangibilty, division of labor, standardization of parts, machines making machines, all that stuff is typically used to characterized the IR, has been around a long long fucking time.I can show you middens where peoples of 200,000 years ago manufactured hand axes in assembly line fashion. For that matter, I can show you mechanical cunning that is billions of years old. When it comes to pound-for-pound machine infrastructure and functionality, a good old carbon substrate can't be beat. Carbon tech kicks ass.We typically think of machines as being made of metal, or more recently, silicon, but good old squishy albuminous slime has done an amazing job as an machine instrumentality for physical manipulation and information processing.Remember the Riddle of Steel?It's true! Flesh is stronger than steel. Flesh fashions steel, and what is flesh but an amazingly intricate miniature elves' workshop of cellular machinery?Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Steven Hawking are all worried about AI. Well, quit worrying. It's already here. In fact, it's probably us, especially if you listen to Professor Nick Bostrom, we are probably just a simulation.Now, what do you do with simulations, provided they are not entertainment? You use them for work.Hang on a second, back up a bit. One of the complaints about automation and cybernetics is that it takes jobs away. It eliminates real people, and in modern times, eliminates real people in favor of fake people - corporations. How that happened is very interesting but, consider:\"The 1810 census rhapsodized about the dawning industrial age, praising \"these wonderful machines\" that were vastly easier and cheaper to employ than humans, \"working as if they were animated beings,...laboring with organs that never tire, and subject to no expence of food, or bed, or raiment, or dwelling\". Nor did they gamble, drink ardent spirits, \"scuffle\", fist-fight, or lollygag during the workday\"For that matter, machines which had once emulated the human hand, could now outperform it.And how has that changed any? Save that, where once the bodily labors were replaced, now the efforts of mind are made a paltry thing by machines.Eli Whitney and Colt and Winchester really didn't give two shits about guns. They were not in the business of making guns. They were in the business of making monies, and they did so by building machines that made machines that could make anything, and they happened to choose guns.How is what Silicon Valley doing in comparison any different? They don't give two shits about AI. They want machine universes that can make machine minds. Building self-driving cars, or robot butlers, or smart homes or kilobit drones doesn't matter. They don't care.So, question, How do you build a functioning electronic brain? Well, you reverse engineer a brain, and then you train it. How do you train it? Through simulations.The old analogy of the hyper intelligent computer creating a still even more hyper intelligent leading exponentially to the Singularity is completely wrong. Those hyper intelligent synthetic minds have not the first clue how to build a better brain.What do they do? They build better simulations. So, video games, already manically real, which have little AI players in them, what do suppose is happening there? They are here already.But what you find is, like us, they are neither artificial, nor particularly intelligent."},

I rode through light industrial land from the auto repair shop to work.Things I noticed:About 75% of the commercial buildings were vacant, with for lease and for sale signs everywhere. So either the economy is nowhere near where people think it is, or more likely, developers have way, way overbuilt. I also see this with transport. Trains are underutilized. Ships are underutilized. Way, way too much supply for the demand.Why don't these owners of empty strip malls and warehouses put solar panels on their roofs? Why not at least generate some kind of income from an empty building you still have to supply minimal utilities to (so that Mother Nature doesn't tear them apart)? Why not try and get server farms or dumb bulk storage, or some such in there? I suppose they are trying that, but way too many of these buildings cater to the idea of being filled with people, and these buildings will never be filled with people again.People are stupid. People are stupid because they adapt their plastic brains to their immediate environment, and then just stop. I think people were a lot smarter before the Industrial Revolution (more later on this maybe). Example: I'm riding on my bike on the road, because light industrial land does not have much in the way of bike trails and bike lanes. Cars and trucks. People driving cars and trucks become cars and trucks. So, I'm on these big animal traces with all these big cars and trucks, and they might as well be buffalo and rhinoceroses and elephants that fast little scurrying bike animal me must avoid. And they just don't fucking notice me. Or when they do notice me they freak out, like an elephant noticing a mouse. They are just big, dumb, lumbering clueless animals. No wonder the Vietnamese called the American armed forces elephants. Just big dumb, lumbering clueless animals.So, big brains does not  = smart. Big brains = big dumb animals with big brains.Speaking of which, Im reading a book called \"The Gunning of America\" by Pamela Haag. I may do a book report on it, but so far, it's just entertaining, and the gist of what I've gotten from the book (still early), is the The Industrial Revolution Took All The Fun Out Of Guns.Or, as the Washington Post reviewed the book: Guns in America were no big deal, until Big Business Made Us Love Them.Which is to say, Ms. Haag does not wish to enter into the current argument about guns, merely provide a historical perspective as to how we arrived where the nation is with respect to guns.Marketing made guns a fetish item. Guns became an exceptional tool, much the same way that Americans fool themselves into thinking that America is exceptional. America is a nation, an interesting and unique nation, but that's about it. Guns are not exceptional tools.(The guns = tools argument often turns into a logical fallacy, a category error that pro-gun apologists make, noting that weapons are defined as technology, and are therefore tools, and tools can be misused. Failing to note that a weapon is a tool, but a tool is not a weapon. The sole purpose of a hammer or screwdriver or a shoe is not for maiming and killing).Honestly, for the longest time, guns were toys. Toys that made noise. Guns occasionally were useful, but only under limited circumstances, and only within a certain range. Inside or outside that range? Useless. Better to have a knife, or an arbalest. or even a stone, the original ranged weapon.On the American frontier, already manicured by Native Americans into ideal hunting ground, I'm going after small to medium game. If I use bow and arrow, I can kill many rabbits and squirrels and deer and birds. If I use a blunderbuss, or even a rifled musket, still wildly inaccurate beyond a certain range, I scare away ALL the game with one shot. So, gun for hunting, back then? Not so good. Not if you wanted to eat on a steady basis.But the Indians wanted firesticks you say! Well, the Indians would have wanted a Camaro if they had been around.Those things were novelties, toys, prestige items, something the other chiefs didn't have. But you didn't fucking use them for hunting!Guns are actually not a problem. Never should have been a problem. Became problem once big business took over. Big business takes the fun out everything.People with guns are a problem. More specifically, and wow I am in agreement with Wayne Lapierre on this, people with bad brains that have guns, rotten brains, brains that go haywire, are a problem.The difference between Lapierre and I is what constitutes mental illness. Who has bad brains? Feel threatened? In fear of your life? Feel the need for personal protection? Maybe you are paranoid. Maybe you've got a rotten brain.Think about it, the situation that you wish to resolve requires lethal force? Really? Your going to go up to that scary or annoying person, whoever it is that has turned you into a scared little bunny, and with your bunny paws you going to ba-BAM blood and guts and brains all over you, and that solves the problem. Remember we are dealing with civilian life here, not a war zone. Even in the inner city, it is not strictly a war zone. People don't live in war zones. Not for long. If it is really a war zone, they  usually become refugees.All these phantoms and phantasms and bad feelings and discomforts and oh-dearie-dears that you feel you are undergoing drive you to the conclusion that you must kill? Or even maim? Perhaps disfigure for life, and that'll teach them?I'd say you are insane.By my definition, Wayne Lapierre is insane. He lives in a very safe house in a very safe neighborhood and goes to work in a fortress, and feels threatened and in need lethal personal protection?That's one fucked up brain. I'm mean look at him. He's really quiet. He looks like the quiet type that will just snap under the slightest provocation. He probably should have to take a test if he wants a gun.I can see it right now. Here I am the gun store owner, and Lapierre comes in says he needs a gun.Need a gun? Uh oh.Probably hears voices in his head!I look around at the arcadian calm of suburbia in which we find ourselves, and I say really, and surreptiously push the silent alarm. Time for Wayne Lapierre to be evaluated by the properly trained psychological technicians. Does this violate his 2A rights? I don't see how.Why, even in the inner city, how exactly are you going to be safer brandishing a gun and waving it around? You don't have to be on any drug, just all stressed out.No, I'm sorry, you got a bad brain. You probably need to evaluated."},
{"title": "Little Black Box, Meet Big Black Box", "date": "Wednesday, July 13, 2016", "text": "I don't think there is a good symbol for recursive substitution. Oh, true, there is a protocol for recurrent sequence, like the Fibonacci sequence, for example, can be represented asfn = fn-1 + fn-2 where f1 = f2.But there is no simple singular symbol like plus or minus or equals is: + - =. I'm not sure if that matters, but it kind of bugs me.I was thinking how history does not repeat itself, and does not rhyme. But it is occasionally almost self-similar, or as some people would say, fractal, when inherent conditions are similar and external conditions are also similar. I noticed this looking at pictures of headhunters in Burma, the Naga tribe, and how, living in similar conditions to the Yanomami, they look the same. Same tech, same lifestyle, even the same hair styles. Despite the fact that they separated by a gulf of 10,000 miles and 10,000 years.So, you might say a similar little black box under the same conditions within a bigger black box produces - perhaps only superficial - similarities in both. And if this is true in space, why not in time as well.And thus people say cute dumb things like \"history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme\".It is also why people go fractal crazy when in fact fractals do not even begin to explain not half of what we see out in reality. They just do a slightly better job than regular old geometry.Take, for example the Mandelbrot set which so many swoon over. Infinite zoom, one person told me. But if you look at the images, after awhile they are so blandly similar and, well, kind of boring, been there done that a few orders of magnitude ago.And what, after all, are you looking at? Well, it's recurrent sequence of a complex number Z plus some constant C such that Z = Z squared plus C, then substitute the new Z into the old Z and square and add C again, and so on.Whoopty-fucking-doo.Now if you do that, you find that the function goes to infinity, and every value ultimately going to infinity ends up, color wise, as all white, like a blank page. But, if you look at the gradient, or how fast it tends towards infinity, and arbitrarily assign a color to the gradient, you end up with the classic picture of the Mandelbrot set.Okay, so what? Point being I guess that self-similarity ain't all it's cracked up to be, but still, you use what you got. As that creepy old incompetent psychopath Donald Rumsfeld said, shrugging off the severed limbs and shredded viscera of poorly armored American servicemen, you go to war with what you got.Anyway, the self-similarity tool I used last night to compare historical processes, and it went like this:I'm reading an account of Eli Whitney. Yes, of the cotton gin (and the inadvertent propagator of slavery and genocide, by making green cotton that grows well in Mississippi and Alabama profitable). Eli Whitney managed to finagle a contract with the federal government to produce 10,000 stand of arms (rifle and bayonet) at $13.40 a pop.Keep in mind, in the 1790s, America had a gun problem. There weren't enough guns.So, at the time the craft industry just could not meet the demand of government. Whitney proposed to use \"machinery moved by water\" and to form \"tools so that tools themselves shall fashion the work\".Whitney was kind of successful, in a wink and a nod kind of way, when in 1801 he demonstrated to President John Adams that random selected parts could be assembled into a rifle. (The parts had been pre-selected and fitted and finessed by craftsmen to actually work). Thus, the not entirely new idea of standardized parts was made manifest.But what struck me was the account, a year prior to the White House demo, of how a government inspector arrived at Whitney's factory completely appalled to find that Whitney had a not produced a single rifle, but was instead making machines.I suppose the reason this seemed profound is so many things that we have done in the industrial revolution are exactly that. We are not making machines to make items. We are making machines to make the machines. And what struck me is that this is exactly what we are currently doing with AI.We are not creating artificially intelligent programs. We are creating programs to create programs. AI is simply an item that is a result, and not a goal. And if the endeavor is successful, it will be as easy, and inadvertently easy, to create 10,000 AIs as it is to create one.I wonder what they'll create?"},

{"title": "I Did It Again", "date": "Tuesday, July 5, 2016", "text": "Got word from Kohler Arts Center that I was rejected - once again - for a residency.Try again next year.My proposed exploration involved breaking molds and producing forms from those broken molds. There was an option to work in glass in conjunction with Corning Museum of Glass, also. I made the same proposal for glass casting. No dice.I've been trying to cast this particular motif in glass and it don't want to be. So, the rejection and the wonderful discovery of a broken mold in the kiln with glass all over the kiln shelf, coupled with everything I touch turning to shit, would suggest, well, not that I give up, but that I reevaluate.See this is what distinguishes me from incompetent psychopaths like Donald Rumsfeld, who would just \"stay the course\". And we know how well that works out. It doesn't.Another distinction between me and Donny is, he gets rewarded for his incompetence.Anyway, two cast glass pieces out of the kiln this weekend. The first is Purple Capped Fleshy Jelly, which is kind of boring and just looks like an octopus wearing a hat.

{"title": "Humping Through The Apocalypse ", "date": "Thursday, June 23, 2016", "text": "There is a room in Nick Bostrom's Institute of Doom at Oxford labeled the Arkhipov Room. If you were born before Oct. 27, 1962, you owe Vasili Arkhipov your life. What I'm talking about is how Arkhipov declined to start WWIII during the Cuban missile crisis. Our US Navy was hammering his sub with intense sonar and practice signal depth charges, in an attempt to force it to the surface. The captains of Arkhipov's flotilla voted unanimously to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike. Arkhipov overruled them. If you were born after that date, thank Vasili you don't have two heads, or a heart outside your body, or that you are not some kind of tumorific retarded abomination.(Oh, that's not strictly true, human response to various kinds of ionizing radiation is quite an impressive spectrum. Some people can shrug even lethal doses off, others are shrinking violets, killed by a sun tan). Radiation would have been a problem, but the more important threat of nuclear winter certainly would have produced a substantial cull. Estimates of nuclear stockpiles in 1962 put it around a total of about 740 megatons. That's more than enough for a really good solid 10 year nuclear winter. Throw in the ionizing radiation, and it's a pretty good bet that humanity would have numbers reduced by around 90%, maybe 99%, with our tech level pushed back to probably 500AD. The rich and the powerful, of course, would have been safely snug in their underground dens, but even they would face a bleak future once they stuck their soft little heads out, blinking stupidly in the harsh UV light, what with the ozone layer blown to Mars.How bad, specifically? Well, the US of A enjoyed a six to one superiority in nukes over Soviet Russia. This is one of the reasons the Soviets bankrupted themselves, trying to achieve parity (which they did, briefly, in the 1970s).The United States was armed with 203 ICBMs, 1,306 bombers with 3,104 warheads, and 144 SLBMs. Some 26,400 warheads.The Soviets had 36 ICBMs, 138 bombers ferrying 392 warheads, 72 SLBMs. Around 3300 warheads. US of A: 630 megatons. Soviet Union: 103-280 megatons, depending upon whom you talk to. Anything worth bombing in the USSR would have been scraped clean to bedrock in a little under two hours. The Russian language would be \"spoken only in Hell\".For the US? We would have \"got our hair mussed\".Noted psychopath General Curtis LeMay was correct in calling President Kennedy \"a pussy\", in that the US would have wiped the floor with the Soviets. But, every city on the eastern seaboard, from Boston to Miami, and as far west and North as Houston to Dallas to Cincinnati would be smoking holes in the crust of the Earth. 20-40 million Americans dead for starters. Many more once the shroud of poisons had circled the Earth.And my fate? Interestingly enough, and unknown to us, our neighborhood had kind of banded together and come with a plan of people sharing basements. Ludicrous, yes. Even more bizarre? I found out that our neighborhood had a swingers' club, about four or five households.Yes, all those parents swapping partners and fucking in orgies. I don't think my parents were in the club, but who knows? One does not like to think about one's parents fucking each other, let alone fucking neighbors. But, hey, Mom and Dad were young and attractive once, so who knows? Interestingly, every single one of the swinger households? Had a basement. Hmmm. Other things. Working on some more bronzes. This one is tentatively titled \"You Don't Know Where That's Been\".On the assumption that my art is becoming and more and more of a storage problem, and less and less objects people desire, I am pushing the scale down some.

{"title": "Can A President Trump Take On The Deep State?", "date": "Tuesday, June 21, 2016", "text": "Short answer? No.Longer answer? If Trump were able to bump up his IQ and expand his worldview beyond Trump, he might approach the evil genius of Richard M. Nixon, who was the last president caesar to actively control the Deep State. He'd also have to find an equally evil person like Henry Kissinger.Between the two of them, they managed to tear out all the control wires, short out the circuit boards, blow the fuses, and concentrate control to just the two of them (and their cohort of minions). But I just can't see Trump doing any of that. Nowadays, he has to take on the military/industrial complex, plus Wall Street, plus Silicon Valley. That loosely analogous Venn diagram of the Troika, with the Deep State as intersection.People will then say, well, what about Hillary? It's true that Hillary thinks she's Nixon, but she's not. She and Bill were bought and sold long, long ago, and - just as Bill found out Wall Street pulled his strings - Hillary will find she won't be able to cut the strings of the Troika.Plus, the last person to try to take on the Deep State was JFK, and we all know how that turned out.The Donald is not about to try anything like that. He'll do as he's told, a lot less eagerly than Hillary, but not as hesitant as Obama.  (And the co-caesarship of Cheney/Bush? Well, Cheney is just an appendage, the tendrils grown in so deep it is hard to tell now if a Dick Cheney ever even existed).Oh, don't get too paranoid. The Deep State is not nearly as sinister or as modern as you think.First of all, what is the Deep State? It is a daikaiju. Kaiju, Japanese for \"strange beast\" or monster, daikiju: Giant monster. The Japanese pegged us pretty well when they made Godzilla.The Deep State is a Thing, a loosely aggregated, not always in sync, Swarm Thing. Its an It. Not a singular monolithic It, but an It just the same. It's purpose? Well, let me quote Tony Montana from Scarface:\"In this country, gotta make the money first. Then, when you get the money, you get the power. then, when you get the power, you get the women\".Well, that's almost right. But it's ass-backwards. Money isn't shit. Any idiot can make money. Money doesn't get you power. Money is honey. Power is the bees. Honey doesn't make more honey. Bees make honey. Control the bees, and you can make honey. And to control the bees, you control the queens. Queens are the power. Without women you got no self-replicating robots. Without self-replicating robots, you got no money to play with.So, the purpose of the Deep State is to keep women, and thus men, under heel. The Deep State does it's best to keep people fearful, cynical and apathetic. Well, It has done a good job by me. I am fearful, and I am cynical. But I am not apathetic. If I were, I would write about It.Thing about this Thing is, It has been around for so long we are used to It, even occasionally comforted by, and even profiting from It. Like farmers living next to Mount Vesuvius. So, let's drop the capitalization. That helps to be a little less fearful of it.How old is the deep state? Well, depends upon whom you talk to.Was WWII the dawn of the deep state? No, that was the dawn of American hubris - I think. It's true that the modern version of the deep state goes back to atomic weapons and the B-29, but the finance captured our government before then. WWI? J Pierpont Morgan and his cohort was already in control, so no.How about post-Civil War? Getting a little closer. Certainly financiers were in control, and we could make a case for the dawn of the military/industrial complex. (Just not as specialized, for back then, captains of industry could easily swap between military and civilian purposing).British Empire? America was, for the longest time, just the Western appendage of it.Romans? After all, England is just Rome v3.7. But no. Sumer? Aleppo? Jericho? Gobleke Tepe?The deep state, I'm going to argue, is at least 10,000 years old, and possibly older. What do I look for? Walls. Why, its obvious that even Gobleke Tepe, men already were quite familiar with placing stone upon stone.You can find walls going back 20,000 years. I'll bet a lot older, but you got to go deep fishing for those artifacts. (Sea level being hundreds of feet lower than today back then).But that's what I would look for. Walls. Funny thing about wall, they don't work. Oh, they kind of work in the short term, but you can't show the ruin of a city that didn't have a wall. And walls work both ways, for keeping things out and also for keeping things in.Paradise, after all, means an enclosed park. Walled in. And the wall says, plenty of stuff inside for me, nothing for you. What do put in paradise? Women.  Boy, there's a reason to find a way to break walls."},
{"title": "ゴジラ", "date": "Saturday, June 18, 2016", "text": "I’m going to warn you right up front. I wake up in hospital beds a lot in this story. Actually only two times, but anyway, it’s not a lazy plot device. It’s just what happens. Maybe I should get you up to speed if you are not familiar with my circumstances. I currently live in Spiral City, have lived here since 2001, give or take. Spiral City is on a peninsula fronting a bay on the western edge of the biggest continent of the planet Alterra. Alterra, and its moons Algemina and Sessus, circle a G2 star about midway inside a spiral galaxy two hundred and fifty million light years from Earth. Back on Earth, if you look up at the nighttime sky, we would be in the constellation of Hercules, if that helps.  I rent space in one of the downtown frontier strip malls. I have a corner shop there. It's not very big, but doesn't need to be for my line of work. I'm a peranoscopist. 'Soothsayer' in the common use, 'Magic Eightball' to skeptics and snobs. The rest of the strip mall is owned and occupied by my landlord Aaron Willis. Yes, that Aaron Willis. Trillionaire owner of the entire freaking planet Aaron Willis. This is his world and the rest of us just live on it.=============================This first time before I end up in hospital? I am tutoring Aaron’s daughter Camilla about universal quantum solutions to Kerr-Godel-Everett bridges, and Jonbar hinges as one interpretation. (Jonbar hinges are a science fiction term for those forks in the road of history where things go all different).I'm up at the chalkboard when the door opens, and the Jussinniemis walk in, followed by the Bundy boys.\"Um\" I look up at the visitors, none looking particularly friendly, turn to Camilla and say \"You know what? We'll continue the lesson later. I gotta take this call\".If you get the impression I might be in trouble, you are right. The Bundy boys I'm not too worried about. But the Jussinniemis? Brothers Aabel and Heikki, freelance muscle, are big hulking bruisers. Worst of all is little sister Johanna. Johanna is not little, but not hulking thank goodness. Actually pretty much of a stunner, blonde, tall, slim, muscular. Johanna leans forward, elbows on my counter.\"Hi Hanna\" I start, \"are we finally going to go out on a date?\" I, as casually as possible, start to reach for the shotgun under the counter.\"Don't\" grins Hanna.I talk past Hanna towards the Bundys. \"Hi Aamon. I think I know why you are here\".\"Eightball gets something right for a change\", snorts Aamon. \"Too bad you didn't do ba etter job warning us about that avalanche\".\"I told you not to take your expedition over that mountain pass. Wait one extra week, I said, or take the long way to the further pass, I said\". I receive a glower in response.I sigh. \"No refunds, Aamon\", \"It's in the contract\".\"Oh, we don't expect a refund, \"Aamon actually looks a little sad. \"But we got to do right by those that didn't come back, so...\" he nods.I try to reach the shotgun, but Hanna puts a thumb in my eye and a finger in my ear. Blinded by tears, I hear a commotion of big bodies in a rush towards me. Someone is thumping on a drum. =============================I wake up in a hospital bed. I moan for a little bit, shifting and stretching without really being quite awake. I'm sore, but not in pain. They must have doped me up.My neighbor Aaron sits next to me leafing through a National Geographic. Seeing I'm awake, he starts in.“You’re fucking up way too much Johnny! Getting stoned too often, man. You’re fucking up. I'm telling you!”“Okay okay”. I stretch and shift and, realizing I am just sore, sit up. \"They must gone easy on me\". “Hey, yeah\" Aaron eyes me coldly. \"Hey, here’s a question for you. How do you feel?\"He doesn't wait for an answer.  \"Sore?\" he sneers, \"A little sore. You know you should be mangled, you dumb fucker. Every one of your bones broken! What those goons did? That was gruesome.”“You saw it?\"“The tail end. Who all do you think kept you alive? Camilla got me, but we would have heard anyway. Your place is trashed.\"I rubbed my face. No bumps. No swelling. \"Hey, here’s another question. The doc did a full body scan on you. Guess what?\"\"What?\" I got out of bed, moved my limbs experimentally.\"The x-ray of your skull? That titanium nail driven into your skull? It’s gone”.(About a decade ago, I'd had a titanium nail driven into my skull by alien monsters).“What do you mean gone? Like it got knocked out? They knocked it out?”“No, stupid. Like it ain't there in your head anymore. That nail dissolved into you”. Aaron looked at me expectantly.“Dissolved? Oh. Full body scan you said?\" I frown in thought. \"Is that why I have no broken bones?\"\"Why those aliens picked you to augment and enhance is a mystery. You got it, ace. Some kind of fascial enhancements. Skeletal and muscular enhancements, too\".\"I got superpowers?\" “No, not superman. More like industrial strength human. Elephant skin and bones of, well, titanium. You don't appear to be any stronger, but I'll let someone else find that out\"\"Well this is stupid! It fucking hurt! When they beat me? It fucking hurt a lot! Enough to make me pass out. What kind of a stupid superpower is that?_\"Yeah, Fucking Furry Octopussies, man! You're even more creepy! Classified suspect alien technology you sure as hell are now\".\"What do mean?\"\"I mean the Furries are here for you. And NATO\".Apparently, while my place was getting trashed and I was having the living shit beat out of me, a giant neon circus which is a Furry Octopoid space station appeared in orbit above Spiral City. =============================The Furry Octopoids, otherwise known as Furries, Teuthids, Kraken, Cthulhunoids, Octopussies, etc. are a billion years ahead of us humans, and the known universe their realm. Or so they claim. I don't know how we could fact check that. I'm not even sure that giant furry octopus is their true and actual form. They could be drones for all I know, a chosen shape to interact with us. =============================\"The Teuthids say they want to see the hatchling, meaning you\" a nameless sergeant is telling me, as we weave through Conex boxes and quonset huts towards the wormhole station at the center of the base. NATO has had an outpost on Alterra since the colony was first seeded, but they've never seen fit to trick it out any better. The base on Sessus, the other end of this base's wormhole, is much nicer, and more up-to-date. I suppose if you want a moon base on a desolate airless moon, you want it to be comfortable.We get to the wormhole station, which is a big geodesic dome, once painted white. This was a bad color choice. Accumulated grime and detritus in the joints and on faces, looks cheesy.  We pass through a series of airlocks to get to the staging area. And there it is, my coffin. It's not a coffin. It's an airtight cylinder just large enough for one person. I fucking hate these coffins, but that's how individuals travel through wormholes. A guy in green fatigues helps me in, and then, after a few bumps and what feels like a ride though a vacuum tube, the lid of the coffin is opened by a set of taloned tentacles.I'm greeted by thin sheets and sprays of expelled furry octopus snot. It's how they smile.=============================\"You finally hatched!\" hiss/spit/growls the krake that showered me with mucus. \"How delightful! You're a little slow, a little retarded, but that's okay!\"The krake steers me away from the coffin with it's tentacles, little pin sharp talons digging into my skin, but not, I note, drawing blood like the last time I met one.It snorts a little wad of mucus, right in my ear. \"Oh, this is very good! We can begin the training immediately!\"\"Training? Training for what?\" I ask.Another spray of snot. \"Oh, so cute, even though you are hideously ugly with two legs! Hatchlings are always so cute!

You are going to be a hero!\"By this point, other krakes have arrived and are copiously coating me with snot as well.\"Do you guys have any wet wipes? Or towels?\"\"Delightful! Yes! Terry cloth towels for the ugly two legs please! What do want us to call you?\"\"John is fine\".\"Johnny! Johnny! Hey Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! We have found one of your lost colonies! They are from Asia! Japan! Um, a 1976 colony? yes. One of the earliest. We are surprised by this. We did not think the Japanese would be so adventurous. So, still, we have found them! They are in big trouble!\"\"What kind of trouble?\"\"A space creature! It's a very bad one! Very big! Very mean! But you will rescue them while there is time! There's not much time! We can entangle them for maybe a week. No more! But you will be ready! You will see! Can you swallow air? Into your stomach? How loud can you belch?\"=============================Three days later, doing nothing but practicing belching, hopping, squatting, and towards the last, wretching, the octopussies declared me ready.I had asked exactly what kind of very big very bad space creature it was, how belching and wretching was going to be of use, and how I was going to be of help. They ignored all my questions. We poofed into existence over a single solitary planet next to an immense nebula almost as colorful and flamboyant as the teuthid station.A swirling tentacular tip indicated the nebula. \"That's where the creature is! It will come soon come It's here to lay eggs! You must go down to the planet and protect them. We will help!\"=============================I am disoriented for a bit, dizzy, a little vertigo, things not quite in focus. I hear... air raid sirens. Strange. Yeah, blaring sirens. I look around and, hmm, rooftops. Rooftops of buildings. I must be way up someplace in a building. And everything is... black and white. No color. I'm a bit unsteady on my feet. I look down, and - What the fuck?I've got clawed feet. Reptile feet. I look over my body, and I'm a lizard. And judging from the buildings around me, I'm a giant lizard. Maybe 160 feet tall, I'm guessing. \"Johnny! Can you hear me? The monster is coming!\"\"What? What the hell? Hey! What's going on? Did you slip me some LSD or something?'“You are no hallucination. You are a daikaiju! A giant monster. The space creature that is plaguing these people is coming! You must destroy it!”I looked behind me. There was a path of destruction leading back to a harbor.“I didn’t do that!”“No that was you. You were groggy, but that was you”.“Why is everything in black and white?”“You are a giant lizard!. They don't need color! Listen! The space creature is here to lay eggs. If the eggs hatch this planet will be eaten alive. You have to stop it!”I start hearing a high pitched electric whine in the air. I know that sound. “Dude, am I fucking Godzilla?”“Of course!”\"Wha? How?\"\"It's coming! Get ready!\"If this is what I think it is, the space creature, the monster, I know it. It's called Mothra.\"Where? Where is the fucker?” I ask, just as it sails in and smacks me in the back of my head. I see stars.\"Ow! Fuck!'Mothra turns in mid-air, and slams up against me, knocking to the ground. It’s hard carapace untouched, and now it starts digging at my belly with these nasty little razor sharp pincers, while beating me with its wings. Hyper hurricane winds are knocking buildings down around me.\"Ow! FUCK!\" The pincers are digging in to my belly hide. I instinctively grab a wing by the root and twist. Mothra emits a loud screeching electronic tone which deafens me. It breaks free and wheels up into the air.\"Use your atomic vomit!\"\"My what?\"Mothra turns again and 15,000 metric tons of space moth hits me square in the belly. I get slammed into a skyscraper, and then another behind, rubble and steel landing everywhere.“Goddamn it! This fucking thing is beating the shit out of me!”\"Use your atomic vomit! Swallow air and belch and puke!\"“I - okay\".Just as I swallow air and start to belch, Mothra hits me in the belly again. I gag and cough. I almost choke on atomic vomit. \"Dude, I got the hic- I got the hic- I got the hiccups!\"\"Hold your breath, Johnny! HEY! BOO! Did that scare you, Johnny?\"  \"I - \" just then, I start hearing music, little tinny women's voices. \"I hear singing. I hear singing in my head.\"“Oh... SHIT! The Shobijin! They are pure fucking evil! Don't listen to them! They will try to hypnotize you. Get a song in your head! Green Acres! I Dream of Jeanie! Girl From Ipanema!”\"They're in my head! There’s two little Japanese fairy women singing at me in my head. Get out of my head! Jesus Christ they’re like twisted little kernels of evil energy!”“That’s what I’m telling you! That's what they are! Twisted little kernel of evil energies. Mothra is their slave! Keep ‘em out of your head!”I glance down, and somehow I spot. Two tiny little fairies.  \"I see them! Should I stomp them?\"\"No, they indestructible. Get Mothra!”The pain in my head is excruciating. I wrack my brain for a song and finally pick a John Phillip Souza march.  “Good! Good!”Holding my breath seems to have cured the hiccups, but Mothra bowls me over again. I recover, get on my feet, and, swallowing a big gulp of air, belch a huge atomic blast as it recedes. It singes its carapace a little, the wings smoking some, which I hope is good. I've got to crank the volume on the Souza march to cancel out the evil songs of the Shobijin.Mothra turns again, and slams into me, but this time, I grab it, and twist a wing, and use my tail to deflect it in almost a judo move. My tail. Holy shit. My tail. I have a tail. I use my tail to whip around fast before Mothra can get up, blast it good. Again, a little smoldering, but really Mothra is unfazed. It takes off again for another pass.“It's just bouncing off it like a garden hose!”“Well yeah, it’s a giant space moth attracted to stars. It can fly next to stars and not get burned!\"Oh, Great! Mothra flits around the surface of stars, and thus invulnerable to my atomic vomit. This thing is going to win if I don't think of something. It has to have a weakness. Weak spots in the carapace.  “-here to lay eggs”, I remember.“Hey what about the ovipositor? Is that protected?”“Oh! Yes. Disgusting! Clever! That could work!”I flail my tail. Judging from the surge of strength I feel, I bet I can lift myself with this tail. I crouch down, wait for the big giant moth to come at me. It swerves to pass by me, keeping its wings away out of my reach. I launch myself onto Mothra using my tail. I grab hard and hold on. Mothra continues flying through the air carrying me. I shift my hold and manage to clamber into a very undignified 69 position with Mother.Hanging on with my back claws digging into abdomen, I scrabble at Mothra's ovipositor WA like a bear digging into a beehive.Mothra gets distressed, trying to shake me off, and the melodies of black pain from the Shobijin are knifing me into my forebrain. I pry open the lips of her egg chamber and shoot down a giant projectile puke of atomic plasma vomit.The atomic blast into Mothra’s egg chamber  jiffy-pops her carapace. Mothra's corpse makes a tremendous gash in the crust of the earth.Wow, we’re done. The city erupts in celebration. Ships horns, car horns, trolly horns, bells, even the faint tinny roar of cheering humans.“Well played. And just in time. The knot of entanglement is loosening. This region of the cosmos is lost to us once again. We have to go!\"=============================I wake up in a hospital bed. Aaron is sitting to next me thumbing through a National Geographic.\"Oh, that was some fucking dream\".He puts the magazine down.\"They must have really knocked me around. I had a dream I was Godzilla, in a fight with Mothra!\"\"That wasn't a dream. We watched you on TV. It was on all the channels. Hey, there's someone been waiting for you\".The door opened, and a gorgeous blonde stuck her head in the room. Johanna Jussinniemi.\"Hey hero!\" She grinned, \"You still want to go on a date with me?\""},

Oh, the lower to mid-lower income brackets have quite a bit of data, but drug abuse data on people with incomes at or above the $150,000 level are shockingly absent.\"Insufficient data\" say the studies. Criminalization of the unemployed, the working poor, and the poorly educated is a common trend, especially in states involving conservative control. But one thing we do know from statistical sampling is that employed Americans use alcohol and drugs at a far higher rate than the unemployed.Probably because they have more disposable income. Duh. And the more expensive the drug, the less likely the poor, the poorly educated, and the unemployed are to use it.A bill proposed by Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin aims to partially rectify that startling lack of data on drug abuse by the rich, by introducing a bill requiring them take a drug test if they have itemized deductions of more than $150,000. “The benefits we give to poor people are so limited compared to what we give to the top 1%,” she said. “It’s a drop in the bucket.” “We spend $81bn on everything – everything – that you could consider a poverty program,” she explained. But just by taxing capital gains at a lower rate than other income, a bit of the tax code far more likely to benefit the rich than the poor, “that’s a $93bn expenditure. Just capital gains,” she added. And though her bill wouldn’t have any effect on low- and middle-income Americans, clawing back more than $100,000 in deductions from even a handful of super-wealthy recreational drug users – who would be forced to pay for their own tests – could be a much more significant revenue-raiser than testing Tanf recipients.While we are at it, (and I'm not the first to suggest this) if the politicians wish to continue to receive public assistance from the taxpayers, they should be required to be tested for drugs as well. I mean, do they really want to be serious about the War on Drugs or not?You're telling me these three in the video are not drugs? Oh, yeah. Some kind of really good stuff."},

Like coated in sidewise spray of fine shit shit storm? Like heavy driving sheets of liquid shit driven through my clothes into every nook, every cranny, every fold, every pore of my body? Like being in a Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument of a shit storm, so that I am forever non-locally entangled with atomized shit particles no matter how far away in the universe I become separated from them?Well, I was, and not surprisingly I was downwind of a shithole during the shit storm, so that explains that.I'm not unique, I'll betcha. It doesn't take much to be in a shit storm nowadays, for that matter throughout recorded history and before. Ever since the domestication of animals, ever since man put stone upon stone and called himself civilized.So, I was driving west on 198 heading towards Interstate 5 eventually to go to San Francisco. It was during a California monsoon,  and this instance was pretty much a tropical storm with heavy winds and leaden fiercely scudding clouds. At first it was just a misty kind of rain, but then it got heavy, and the wind is jostling and nudging my car between the lane lines, and then I noticed that it smelled like shit.Being from Indiana, I immediately identified it as cow shit. Not pig shit, not chicken shit, not horse shit, all smells I am familiar with, but cow shit. And not dairy cow shit either, but feed lot shit. I'd smelled this kind of shit before driving through Amarillo, TX, which has a big feed lot. So I knew what I was driving through.And wouldn't you know it. I had to stop to pee, and so I had to get out in it at a gas station, and when I did that is when the heavens opened up and pretty much covered me in the powerful deliquesced mélange of bovine fecality. I don't think fecality is a word but fuck it.At the time I was disgusted but now, being pretty much folded into the peasant class, and almost one of the Doomed, this doesn't bother me all that much. I'm not quite a peasant, not quite. True, my skills are pretty much gone. I couldn't do a partial differential equation if my life depended on it. I couldn't code up an app under life-threatening conditions either. But the way I'm seeing things? All these technocratic elites that think they are indispensable are just one neural net project away from my situation.I'm going through a little existential crisis right now. My art career - despite getting stuff in shows - is pretty much in the shitter, with lots of unwanted art rotting away in closets and storage rooms. The good thing about the art career gamble is I've developed some new skills, like welding and fabricating, which pretty much puts me as a sturdy yeoman in the peasant class. But classes and categories are fluid things, not static, not fixed and stationary, but dynamic and alive. Like swirling eddies in a shit storm, which brings us to the value of shit, and classes, and categories, and, yes, things in Washington DC. \"Rome lived on its principal till ruin stared it in the face. Industry is the only true source of wealth, and there was no industry in Rome. By day the Ostia road was crowded with carts and muleteers, carrying to the great city silks and spices of the East, the marble of Asia Minor, the timber of Atlas, the grain of Africa and Egypt; and the carts brought out nothing but loads of dung. That was their return cargo\" - Winwood Reade, The Martyrdom of ManMr. Reade was right and wrong about one thing. The dung was far more valuable than the proclamations of the Senate, and the mandates of Caesars.  Dung, of course, is a powerful commodity. Not only just as fertilizer, but for the longest time the source of the dearest component of gun powder. Dung gives you salt peter. Salt peter gives you gun powder. And gun powder gives you one form of power. Not the only form mind you, but a very easily understandable and easily exercisable form.But the exercise of power is an industry, just not a particularly beneficial industry for those not in power. The governing classes profit and maintain their positions - but only so long as things go well. Ah, but the minute shit hits the fan? Not so well, not so valuable a set of skills. Mendacity and venality can only work for you in an environment of luxurious plenty. Ask any parasite.As a sturdy yeoman, I'm figure actually well placed if shit ever hits the fan. I got skills. I won't end up in the brothel, or not right away. Not like the governing elites, who are good at fawning, and posturing, and the types of criminality that DC is now famous for.And so, to Trump. See? I'm tying it all together. Bullshit. Classes. Elites. What about Trump? In my view, Trump is being set up as a patsy. A willing patsy, who thinks he can turn the tables, but still a patsy of the Deep State.Does this mean Trump is a buffoon? Well, yes, and no. He's not stupid. If Trump were as shallow, vain, vapid and inconsequential as he presents himself, Fred Trump would have smothered him with a pillow in his youth. No, Donald learned at Fred's knee, and knows exactly how to fuck people over. Trump is intimately familiar with the exercise of criminality that we have all come to expect from DC.Which makes him a good candidate for public service in this, our current US of A. But it still means Trump is a patsy. If elected, Trump will be placed in the feedlot, be made to produce valuable dung, and when the appropriate time comes, be led to the slaughter house. Finally some egalitarianism.When it's your turn in line for the stun hammer, maybe you'll be able to say Hi to the Donald!"},
{"title": "Who Will Pay?", "date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2016", "text": "Universal Basic Income. Basically, if you are not aware of what UBI is, some certain amount of public funds would be distributed to everyone. So, say, $1000 a month is given to everyone.The idea has been kicked around, in one form or another, for quite some time. Finland is considering it. The Swiss just rejected it.Henry Orbit don't need no stinking UBI!Some would have the UBI replace all current social safety nets, on the grounds that it eliminates a lot of bureaucracy.  (I don't think that would work entirely, as, for example, people with disabilities or mental issues would be better off with current services rather than cash). Others want the UBI tacked on to existing services.Canada tried it, a small experiment in Manitoba called Mincome. It seemed to work out alright.The big problem most people see is they assume UBI would turn recipients into lazy slackers and moochers. Presumably these people have been able to ignore that, though they may have never received explicit public assistance, their very existence has pretty much been subsidized through one government program or another (for example, defense spending).The other objection is: who is gonna pay for it? This seems to me an objection worth exploring.Consider: In the US of A, the worry is that automation is displacing jobs, with few or no jobs being created for those that disappear. Many feel that this is something to worry about decades from now, if ever, since supposedly new better quality jobs replace the shitty jobs that robots (or foriegn labor) take over. Well, not everyone can be a robot repairman like Henry Orbit.Here is my gedanken.Let's say it's not decades. And let's say it is not just low-skill jobs. Let's say that, given the fact AI seems to finally be growing into itself, all but around 1% of all jobs are gone in, let's say five years. Now, some jobs I'm assuming won't be replaced by automation in five years: strippers, prostitutes, etc. But all the jobs that you think wouldn't go away? They are all gone, replaced by robots that can do it faster, cheaper, smarter. That 1% of jobs remaining? Performed by centaurs: half human/half AI workers.(AI doesn't mean smarter as in smarter than human, which are tolerable generalists. One thing we've noticed is most tasks don't require a lot of brain power to do. And it turns out that a remarkably small brain can do some rather ingenious specific tasks. Think crows. Think spiders. Think any animal with a brain smaller than yours that can kick your ass at whatever it is that animal is good at).So, your job, whatever it is, artist, musician, CEO, surgeon, hedge fund manager, politician, has been replaced by some machine learning algorithm that magnificently grew into the task and does a much better job than the most accomplished human. Only the most menial or awkward or incredibly strange jobs remain, by virtue of humans being cheaper or irreplaceable (for the moment).So, where does the public revenue come from? Currently, public revenues come mostly from income and payroll taxes. It's possible that corporations (the new people) could kick in more, but I wouldn't count on it. So, the revenue for UBI is coming from payroll and income tax. Let's break it down down more. Payroll tax accounts for about a third of all public revenue. And, in turn, usually people in the middle to bottom pay the lion's share of payroll taxes. The rich? Hardly any. And income taxes? The reverse (as the rich like to remind everyone). But payroll taxes are trending towards the chief revenue source.Well, who cares who is paying what. Let's say that the 1% of jobs is fairly egalitarian and revenue, to keep things simple, is cut 1% across all income groups.In 2015, total revenue was $6.7 trillion. In 2020, under the conditions of the gedanken basically been cut to 1% of that, or $67 billion. That's $216 per US citizen. I don't know how you are going to live off that. Actually, you can, but it means a lot of belt tightening. Some in the upper brackets will not be used to that. Hopefully, the've lots left over in their trust funds and hedge funds and properties so we don't here them whine too much, but the rest of us are just a little bit fucked.Besides, who is buying all this shit that the robots are making?"},

{"title": "The Illusion of Design", "date": "Thursday, June 9, 2016", "text": "Given a philosophical choice between the systems of preformationism and epigenesis, I choose epigenesis every time. And the reason I do is because I have the entire larger universe empirically backing my choice, pretty much since the beginning of time itself.Which is to say, practically everything in the Made World that is of good design... was not designed.Inventions rarely have actual inventors, but evolve out of a flock of outcomes and developments that are in rapid florescence. The Internet was not designed. The mobile computer market was not designed. The telecomm, media, oil, coal, steamship, rail, road services were not designed. Social safety nets were not designed.They all evolved from prior ratcheted systems that unfolded on their own, from the bottom up.Keep in mind that the term evolve is originally from the Latin e- (out of ) volvere (to roll). The idea is to unfold, to unroll, like a scroll, or a leaf, or a flower.Anyone who has been involved in design will tell you that 90% of anything designed (things and systems, networks, and institutions) are shit.The ones that are not shit are designed taking advantage of, and from, an already evolved system.If you think that our current system as a representative republic sucks? Blame James Madison, and the other Founding Fathers, because it was designed. This is not to denigrate Madison, who came up with a slick as snot design, based upon his own observations of the failures of past republics.His answer to the problems of factionalism and the dreaded mob rule of direct democracy (knowing that the more local the control, the worse the dictatorship) was to borrow a Copernican system of satellite states revolving about a strong federal sun.That system lasted all of four score and seven years.  The Madisonian solar system turned in the Lincolnian system - tweaked by turning up the dial of solar gravity and reigning in the wild horse packs of the states. In a classic arms race, the states, in turn, became loose agglomerations of regional orbiting worlds. Planets and moons, Trojan asteroid groups, if you will. And today, for example, we have the moon states of the southeast and the mid-atlantic orbiting about the Jupiter of Virginia. We have the southwest and northwest reluctantly in tow behind California. Regionalism is the response to a stronger federal sun.So, evolved, in some sense, but still within the parameters of the designed Constitution. And the main purpose of the Constitution is to make it as hard as possible to govern. As a result, is it any wonder that things suck so badly, because everything takes forever to get done.Is it any wonder that the two worst people in the world for the position of President of the United States of America have been given the presumptive nomination?One rather wishes for demarchy, but that, too, if you are not careful, is a designed system..."},

{"title": "Kids, learn to code RNA. You're Welcome. ", "date": "Tuesday, June 7, 2016", "text": "Maybe about a decade ago, a friend of mine had a little kitten named Olive. I was over at their house one summer day, drinking a glass of ice water filled with that crushed ice like you get in a Slurpee.The kitten got interested in my water, so I tipped the glass and let her have a few licks. She went nuts. She stuck her little head in my glass and greedily lapped at the ice water. I took a swig, and it jumped up on me and tried to get more. That is the power of ice water. The sweet cold taste of clear mountain water off a glacier. Unbelievable. No wonder it was a luxury in Roman times. They'd cart the ice down from the mountains, packed in straw, and store it in rock tunnels. And the Romans would enjoy ice water, same as us. Except, of course, we didn't have to worry about diphtheria and typhoid fever.So this morning, I go to one of those old fashioned drinking fountains, the Oasis brand. The ones that have the Greek-letter-looking EBCD on the handle. Since I was dehydrated from the night, and had biked into work, the water - ice cold - was beyond refreshing. It was indescribably good, and I understood why that little kitten had so greedily lapped it up.What a luxury that is! Clean cold water. Jesus we don't have any conception of just how amazing it is until, well, after the Apocalypse, I suppose.I'll miss coffee as well. And ice cream.But that's not what I to talk about.  So, I'm thinking lately about neural nets, and how basically everyone is going neural net/machine learning crazy lately. As if it were finally an appreciated luxury like ice water.Well, it's nothing of the kind. It's true that the current versions are impressive, but that's really more due to advances in hardware and sheer processing power than to any game-changing software advances. Like for example, any of coding expertise, of which there is hardly any. I mean, perceptrons were doing symbolic logic in the 1940s. ANDs, ORs and NOTs had all been successfully  implemented in Hebbian networks. The XOR (of which computer scientists said neural nets couldn't do, and therefore neural nets couldn't be good computers) was figured out in 1946. Here's how you do it:But we don't care because we don't really want to build computers. We know how to build computers. We have had computers since at least 500BCE and probably long before.We want to build electronic brains. And we do it by (primitive aping, still) reverse engineering real brains. The deep learning networks we have, impressive as they be in performance, are woefully sparse and scarecrow stiff in comparison to real brains. Neurons do amazing calculations inside themselves, chemicals and hormones flood the network with broadcast signals, not to mention the narrow cast signals we ape with these weighted links in nets are just so fucking paltry and primitive compared to the symphonic splendor of even worm brains.So, when all those experts tell the kids that it is important to learn to code, all I can think of is that it is rather like telling kids in the 60s that it is important to learn Morse code. Because, you know, telecommunications! Satellites! All those satellites are gonna be beep beep booping at each other, so you better know all about it, kids!But fact of the matter is the new model to go by is the neural net. Everything can be a neural net. Shipping networks, cars, anthills, beehives, classrooms, you name it. And telling people they can by with a little IF THEN ELSE is quite frankly a little dishonest. It's getting their hopes up, when they lose that make-work factory job, they'll earn big bucks as coders! Well, sorry, but the code doesn't need your stupid help. All it needs from you is what you want it to do.Is there one place where learning to code might come in handy? Yeah, biology, but you gotta be smart to that. So, I guess you all better hope that the basic living income comes to pass...Oh, yeah, and you should probably kill your boss while you are at it."},

{"title": "Deep Neural Shipping Network", "date": "Monday, May 23, 2016", "text": "An article about the global shipping network on Motherboard caught my attention. Doing a first order analysis of shipping behaviors, where ports are nodes, and the shipping between them the links (number of ships weight of links) shows that first order dependencies are poor predictors of global shipping.They found this out when they examined the spread of zebra mussels. Zebra mussels are spread from port to port in the ballast of cargo ships. The spread of zebra mussels does not correspond to the behavioral model of shipping.Current behavior models only look at first order dependencies. For example, if more ships go from  Tokyo to San Francisco, the model says a ship usually ends up in San Francisco instead of Los Angeles. That's not the case.Higher order dependencies, such as where the ship came from before Tokyo, give better predictors of where it goes. Thus a ship going from Shanghai to Tokyo may be more likely to end up in Los Angeles (more properly the terminus of Long Beach).A slightly more detailed report can be found here. Now, what I found interesting was the diagram they used.See, what that looks like to me is not a static network, but a dynamic neural network. One of those, what they do call it? Encoder-decoders? You know, where they do a nested or sandwiched net. The input layer of a net feeds an input layer of another net sandwiched in, and the output layer of the inner sandwiched layer feeds the output layer of the outer net.Next logical step in logistics, I suppose."},

Not worry about the truth, or lies, and not have to keep track of truth or lies we told to stay consistent. We just made shit up on the fly and eff you if you didn't buy into it.But, long before man first put stone upon stone and called himself civilized, he drew shit on walls. And the minute that happened, canon was produced, an official story line, a baseline narrative from which all offset variants would be compared and measured. And so, official lies came into existence. We went from the Dreamtime, where everything goes, to a linear constraint of narrative. Any digression was suddenly suspect, no longer open to play.So, art is a curse and a blessing. Art braids that peculiar rope of bullshit we call history.And one of the most important aspects of history is being in it. Being memorable.Which gets us back to \"ME ME MEEEE!I got into the Rockford Art Museum's Midwestern Biennial. Again. Third successive time. With two pieces in the show. I love Rockford Art Museum.The two pieces are The Stockmen.and Runt of the Litter.I also got The Smokemakers shipped back to me from the Disruption show at Grounds For Sculpture.Imagine my surprise when, reading through the May issue of Sculpture Magazine, I find an article by Ilene Dube about the Disruption show, More importantly, at the very end of the article is a mention about my work! I'll quote it:John Kurman (CSI) also explores the future in The Smokemakers, two figures who appear to be fending off chemical warfare with vacuum cleaners, oilcans, and plumber's tools. Though fighting futuristic forces, they are using very 20th-century weapons. their faces, covered with rectangular bronze blocks, look like they are ready to press something at the cleaner. Kurman's other works hint that the enemy might be a bug.Thanks, Ilene, and I gladly accept the interpretation. It occurs to me that, on prior occasions, things I have made were physical manifestations of subconscious or unconscious themes or matters of import that my shallow little conscious self was not entirely aware of, or preferred to ignore or deny. All those angry kidney objects kind of presaged the kidney problems I had. And I don't like bugs, but I keep on making them,.. so there must be something there.I think Ilene's take helped me solidify an ongoing worry of mine, and don't laugh because this is going to sound ardently very high school, but Global Warming.Here we are, on our way to 4C degree warmer earth. People are in denial or apathetic about it. If things don't change, we end up that much warmer sooner rather than later as a result of something called the 2nd derivative. (Change accelerates). Well, folks, some will ask \"What's wrong with a warmer earth? I wouldn't mind that!\"I'll tell you what's wrong with that. Bugs. Big and little bugs. Big bugs, as in arthropoda, in the form of pests and parasites, and things that dearly love to eat our crops. Crops that we will have a smaller and smaller area to grow in due to the coming Big Squeeze (not just flooding of coastlines, and that's on its way big time, but extreme weather, and latitudinal diminishment of living space and habitat). Also little bugs, germs that dearly love to get us sick and sickly. And the bugs in between, the parasitic blood worms and metazoans like malaria and chagas, elephantiasis and other grisly awful shit. Things that were deterred by deep freezes will no longer be deterred.That's what a 4C warmer world promises. Not a tropical paradise. As an Englishman of my acquaintance once explained: \"If you are not fortunate to be at a resort, the Tropics are pure hell\". And the problem with combating this problem, is so far, we are using last century's weapons and methods, because we always end up fighting the wrong war. So, it's all coming, even if we fight it.(Which is the definition of conservatism: a futile attempt to preserve the status quo). Long before the 22nd Century, the signpost up ahead: Welcome to Pure Hell.Time to rewrite my artist's statement."},

Now mom got a little upset to find out we are more Swedish than Norwegian, but no one else could get all that worked up over it.Haplogroup U8 though, is fairly rare, and U is very old, probably the pioneers in Europe. The Basque are the most modern collection of haplogroup U, and U (as X) also made it across the Bering land bridge into the the Americas.So, like Dad's family, we all followed just footsteps behind the glacial retreat into Europe, Asia and the Americas.Want to find some evidence of our occupation? Get some scuba gear ro a submersible, because the artifacts are all hundreds meters below sea level.

I know geologists don't like catastrophism, but oral history has a way of having an amazing fidelity, but no small grounding in fact. I'm thinking we pass down stories about the glacial melt surge that happened, say, 14,600 BCE.And you know what I say? Expect another catastrophic Big Melt and Flood, and soon. I'm looking at you, Florida.Reality is never what you expect it to be. That's how you know it's real. Same with apocalypses, by gum."},

Even eldest bro was in from California on business. Mom was sick as a dog and spent the whole time in bed. Bronchial infection, and she didn't go to the doctor for fear they would put her in the hospital. We all noted that they don't actually put people in the hospital, and she should have gone to the doctor  instead of trying to fight it off in order to spend time with us.She very much wanted to cook something nice for me, and I said don't worry about it Mom. I cooked something nice for her instead. I also cooked breakfast for my brothers. Just like old times in college, when I cooked for the house - for my roommates in the house we rented.Bachelor chow, of course. Beef stew. Chili. Spaghetti and meatballs. On Friday nights, steak, refried beans, and home fries. You name it for breakfast, but I made a huevos rancheros casserole dish that people would just happen to stop by to eat.Not much of a cook now, when it's only me, but glad to know I still got the chops.My younger brother laid a bombshell on us, informing us that his son now identifies as a woman. We, of course, voiced support for our nephew/niece. I could tell he was trying to do the Northern European thing of not letting it bother him, but I could tell it shook a few pillars.Well, what you gonna do? Modern family. You support decisions, your support family and that's that.I guess it could not be a better time for kid to be transgender.Me?

It's a spy flick, a parody, and the supervillain, in the end, turns out to be The Phone Company.

Here's the scene:Quite prophetic, all things considered. I certainly would not allow any brain/machine interface chip implanted in my brain. Something wearable, like the technology that the Open Water startup wishes to develop, I might be amenable towards.So, and then, what with mobile tech pulling down a trillion in revenues a year, far more than anything else has ever done, and signifying mobile tech becoming pretty much ubiquitous across the planet. You do the prognostication. We will all be borgified sooner rather than later.People wearing brainwave-translating hairnets hooked up to mobiles: electronic telepathy, no more privacy, the ending of barriers of timer and space (at least, within about a 5000 mile range or so), and breaking down the borders of ego, and we end with a global hive mind.Not that that's new.

{"title": "The Green Zone", "date": "Monday, May 9, 2016", "text": "I had a conversation with my weekend boss about sculpture placement in public spaces within the city of Chicago. He was complaining that he is on a fund raising committee to recruit sponsors and wealthy donors, and he's having a hard time finding them. He also complained that the person (who is the liason between the City of Chicago Parks District and a sculpture organization he belongs to) who plans where sculptures go was taking forever to find a spot for the sculpture we are currently working on.After a questions, I noted that this should be relatively simple that could be done on an excel spreadsheet. It's not even a Hard NP problem like the Traveling Salesman or Just In Time Inventory. It's a pretty damn easy situation to resolve: places, times, durations. What's so hard?There are tons of public parks and undeveloped open spaces and easements throughout Chicagoland for these sculptures to go up in.And then I realized, ahhh, we have personalities and politics involved. You got sculptors that want prime locations for their stuff to be displayed. I understand this, but the primary motivation of these sculptors - to sell their work - actually prevents them from optimally selling their work. Let me put it this way, these sculptors, jostling like invertebrates over prime nesting sites, fail to notice that their shit doesn't sell. At least, not if they are not top tier. If they top tier, they don't go through this futile rotation of public sites. The powers that be, if you are top tier, give you prime choice sites.And what exactly are these sites that the sculptors are jostling for? Why, on the North side, more specifically, the tony upper-income areas like Lincoln Park, Lakeview, etc. They feel someone amongst the upper-class denizens will see, like, and buy their stuff. Sometimes that happens. But in general the plan is about as effective as going to the ball park with your glove, catching a fly-ball out in the bleachers, and having the general manager of the ball club shout \"Sign that boy up!\"It don't happen.But let me get back to that prime real estate. When I say North side, what that translates as is \"Where all the white people are\". In other words, where it's safe. Or relatively safe.I've known about the makeup of the city of Chicago and the institutional racism involved since I was a little kid. It's like water for fish, you don't even notice. This should not come as a surprise, but reading an article in the New York Times about black, hispanic, and white perceptions kind of recently drove the point home.  Those white people live in the Green Zone.The people who live in the South and West sides live in the Red Zones.From the article:“I’ve been living in this neighborhood about 30 years and I really like it — it’s gotten nicer over the years,” said Tammy Snider, 60, who is white and lives on the North Side. “I sometimes take the bus to an aerobics class in an area that’s not that safe, but it’s during the day.”The difference between the North Side of Chicago and the Green Zone in Baghdad is that the concrete bollards and blast shields were all built back in the 1960s and they are called highways. But other than that, not much. (Oh, there is a concentrated effort to keep the gangs small and fighting each other, so that, if they get too big, the next thing you know you got truck bombs and IEDs and such... although who knows?)I got a little naively idealistic and said perhaps the donors are a bit jaded with all the free pretty-pretty public art, and would get more excited about placing public works where they are needed most - in the most bullet-riddled public parks in the high crime areas. Hell, find me a sponsor and I'll put something up.\"It'll get graffitied, vandalized, or stolen for scrap!\"Yeah, and so what? Put up another one, keep doing so until something goes up that remains unmolested. People are not fucking animals. You put something nice up, something relevant, something they can enjoy and appreciate and identify with, and some people will care about it. Get enough people to care and it stays up. I'm not foolish enough to think if art is good enough it won't be touched. But I think you could get donors excited over engaging in an arms race of engaging people's humanity.But I don't think it is foolish to think that art is the difference between living and survival. If you don't have the spare time and spare energy for music, dance, poetry, literature, the visual arts, you are not really living are you? You are just surviving."},
{"title": "Red Internet", "date": "Tuesday, May 3, 2016", "text": "Ever wonder why the Soviet Union didn't develop an internet?(BTW, Happy May Day two days late, comrade)!It is Mr. Benjamin Peters contention, filled out in book form, that the Soviet internet failed to materialize (and the American internet did materialize), because the Soviets approached the problem as having a competitive free market solution, whereas the Americans arrived at a solution via a cooperative effort.In other words:The first global civilian computer networks developed among cooperative capitalists, not among competitive socialists. The capitalists behaved like socialists while the socialists behaved like capitalists.I guess I'll have to read the book to follow his argument. The book is How Not To Network A Nation: The Uneasy History of The Soviet Internet by Benjamin Peters.Excerpts may be read here.I'll not spend $40 to read it. I requested of my local socialist book depository that they purchase a copy.(As an aside, ever seen a picture of the two sides of the Berlin Wall? One side was covered in colorful graffiti, the other side the bleak institutional prison gray of bare concrete. Ever seen a picture of the two sides of the border wall between the El Paso and Ciudad Juarez? Guess which looks like which? Guess where the US of A is heading based upon this graffiti analogy? Bonus Guess. Guess where Web 3.0 is going?*)Peter's contention is probably a safe one. Having read about the byzantine machinations that occur in a corporation, the power struggles that enervate any effort to produce a product - having worked in four (three failed, and good riddance) multi-billion-dollar international corporations, seeing what is basically a seething mass of creepy crawlies underneath the upturned rock - I can tell you that there is no difference between either side of the Iron Curtain when you are a prolecat slaving in the salt mines of an organization beyond the Dunbar number.(As an another aside, I would note that one time someone asked if I was an atheist, and I said \"It requires entirely too much faith to entertain that notion\". Agnostic then? Believer? I replied with a wry smile  \"A woman once told she couldn't believe in Fate, but she was a big fan of coincidence\". The Dunbar number, pegged at around 150 is roughly the organizational limit where a group could adequately keep track of itself. Thus, platoons, etc. are usually this number. I would also note that the Bulk number, the number of atoms needed to start seeing global properties emerge from out of the quantum realm, is also pegged at about 150. Coincidence?)In fact, it is to your advantage, since force and fraud is visited upon you every day within the hierarchy, to use what little force and fraud is available to you. (\"Got that report done, Kurman?\" \"By Friday, boss!\")I lost my train of thought. Isn't it an irony that both nations sought out a network solution to a command and control problem? Isn't it an irony that the very solution to this command and control problem, presented as an enhancement towards further egalitarianism will probably someday enslave us all?"},
{"title": "Straight Outta Compton", "date": "Monday, May 2, 2016", "text": "Short Review? Watch it! Good movie, kept the pace going, entertaining, and, unlike almost all biopic movies, mostly true.Oh sure, there were incidents taken out of time context, a little embellishment here and there, but still true to form. As has been noted before, you have to kill the book to make the movie. So it is with biopics, even though there was no book.Now, you might ask, how does a elderly white boy like me know anything about NWA? Well, truth to tell, I did my research after the fact. That's how I know what's what.But, Sherman, set the swayback machine for 1989. What's this white boy doing? He has recently moved to Illinois from Hoosierland and gotten a consultant's job coding mediocre fixed asset inventory software for clueless empty suit business types in a multibillion dollar company that is making monies despite it's own best efforts not to. In his spare time he drinks and smokes weed, takes drawing classes at a local community college, and plays video games. He is being paid a large sum of money to do nothing of worth.Does he wish he had that time back? Yes, he does.He is only peripherally aware of rap and rap music and hip hop. He likes the beat but finds the rhymes juvenile. He is not the rabid weirdo who says that rap music isn't real music. (\"I like all kinds of music except country and rap\" goes the archetypical single's ad). But at this stage of his life, the closest he comes to listening to rap is Parliament/Funkadelic. Which, on the scale of whiteness, makes him positively orange. He is also aware that the principle cultural export of the US of A is not polka, accordion, or marching band music. As such, there is a certain cultural debt that necessitates remuneration... just not from him.So, what's happening in California? It is in full lockdown mode. Business stooge Reagan, having successfully wardened the garrison state as governor, has exported the model nationwide. True, his Veep is now in charge, cleaning up the budgetary mess, but we are just getting started with the prison system and the occasional pockets of luxury walled off from national squalor.(I did spend a brief period in California in the late '80s, and that is when I found that if you are not cop (or cop owner) you are little people. Why it took a visit to California to discover that, I couldn't tell you. Maybe my brain finally grew into the front of my skull pan).California is an interesting place. People think of it as a liberal bastion, a people's republic of pussy hippy types, but one must remember that California gave us both Nixon and Reagan. It is, in many respects, the reddest of red states. For one, it had (or has) one of the most brutal and extensive prison systems in the world. California gave us Charlie Manson. Charles was fucked in the head from the get-go, but it was the California correctional facilities that put the finishing touches on him.California has been, for as long as it has been a state, a very successful criminal enterprise. The feudal ethos is well embedded there, the oligarchy rules the land with an iron fist.California is probably one of the cutting edge examples of a near approach to the Platonic ideal of the free market that you can find. Which is to say, it is pure criminality, force and fraud are well established and well celebrated there as foundational business principles. There's a giant grinding machine, well hidden and distributed about the state, that people can be sent to should they run afoul of California. People will be ground down there regardless of race, creed, or color. But oh, that color. Oh, that race.Which gets us to the movie. It's pretty much the way it is, and the movie told it all the way it is. It sucks. It sucks to be black in California. It shouldn't suck like that, if you read all our high sounding government documents, but it does. Inequality abounds, when, honestly, the only inequality that matters, or should matter, is talent.What is talent? Talent requires a work function to describe it. Talent is, if you will, intelligence, plus energy equals work. Talent must be made manifest to be talent. It's not a fucking IQ test. I don't care if you are IQ-160. Show me what you can do.Now, the interesting thing about the whole Horatio Alger story is that once talent is recognized, it is exploited. Horatio Alger had a nice way of putting it with mentors helping out hard working boys (sorry, no boot straps in the real world, unless, like Athena, you appear out of the shining void fully equipped with all your powers fully formed), and eventually the hard working boys become mentors in their own right by finding more talent. Mentoring, yes, is a selfless and sacrificial act, but is not without its rewards.These guys had talent.A few movie observations. I notice Jerry Heller wrote a book to counter his portrayal in the movie. I notice Suge Knight, if the movie has accuracy, pretty much got what he deserved. I couldn't help but raise my middle finger during the \"Fuck Tha Police\" performance scene in Detroit, and had big fucking grin on my face when I did it. And I know that the real thugs are not the kids, not the stooge cops, but the feudal oligarchs that hide in the sharp-edged shadows of sunny California."},

{"title": "Ultra Society: A Book Report", "date": "Wednesday, April 20, 2016", "text": "Ultra Society by Peter Turchin. How 10,000 years of war made humans the greatest cooperators on EarthLeaving for work this morning, I realized I forgot my cell phone mobile. I went back to get it, and wondered if, back in the 90s, the reason the Japs came up with tamagotchi was to get us all ready for this horrible parasitic little device we all seem to have to have now. I can only hope the Steve Jobs of thew world rot in Hell next to the Timothy McVeighs. (We may have to create virtual Hell to upload them all). Not that Jobs came up with the mobile, merely that he is associated with the thing and just in general deserves to rot in Hell.One other thing I of note was a story my brother told me where he was at a pitching cage with a radar gun. He balled up his body, and with every bit of strength and sinew that he had threw his fastest fast ball... and the radar gun registered 35 miles per hour.Both these things will hopefully be used later on in the essay.So, the premise of Turchin's book is that war created our complex society, and it did so mainly through group selection, or as he calls it Cultural Multitlevel Selection. I had to read the book with a few grains of salt, but generally like it because Turchin, like me, is not a big fan of either Richard Dawkins' or Steven Pinker's scholarship. Which is to say, Often-Wrong Dawkins should probably do what distinguished elderly scientists do best, which is to die and make room for better ideas that are closer to reality.Bishop Dawkins has been pushing the gene-centric view of selection for far too long, has ridiculed and vilified any other kind of selection as pretty much heresy. Pinker also pooh-poohs the idea of group selection. Both rely upon kin selection, reciprocal altruism, and reputation management to explain the evolution of cooperation. Problem is, they don't always work.The biggest problem with the selfish gene model is Dawkins cannot explain altruism or empathy. Dawkins is reduced to a pathetic handwaving statement such as this from his wretched book The God Delusion:In ancestral times, we had the opportunity to be altruistic only towards close kin and potential reciprocators. Nowadays that restriction is no longer there, but the rule persists. Why would it not? It is just like sexual desire. We can no more help ourselves feeling pity when we see a weeping unfortunate (who is unrelated and unable to reciprocate) than we can help ourselves feeling lust for a member of the opposite sex (who may be infertile or otherwise unable to reproduce). Both are misfirings, Darwinian mistakes, blessed, precious mistakes.In other words, \"then something magical happens\". But all one needs to do is look at, say, the African savanna and ask why are all these unrelated animals on the lookout for predators. Or for that matter, why isn't it a Hobbesian war of all against all? What's in it for the zebra to sound the alarm for the wildebeest? Why would any of the selfish little organelles give a shit about the eukaryotic cellular whole? Or for that matter, why do my cells, a great many of them not even me (yes folks, you are a chimerical mosaic monster of other people's and animal's and viruses'  cells and DNA), give a shit about any of the cells in my body, which, honestly, is about as vast and weakly connected as a galactic civilization communicating at the speed of light?No, it doesn't wash. Way too much magical thinking involved. This is not to say that Turchin's system of theory are not immune to magical thinking, but the evidence is piling up that there is indeed multi-level selection going on.Pinker's scholarship also suffers. One of the interesting things is he contends that violence has gone done considerably since our hunter-gatherer days. Archaeological evidence suggests that personal violence may have gone done (we, uh, we sure do like to eat each other a lot), but the societal metric that Pinker uses is to many very suspect. (Some very sloppy scholarship and induction in that book of his). Turchin points out that, if you look at the the archeological evidence, though hunter-gatherers appeared to be violent, the trend of violence increased from 10,000 BCE until about around 500 BCE, then it kind of went down.What happened? Turchin says Religion. Uh-oh, I'm sure Dawkins will stick out a pouty lower lip at that statement. And yet, during what is deemed the Axial Age, monotheistic philosophical movements (Buddhism, Zororastrianism, Confucianism etc.) appeared that suddenly pushed for a kinder gentler type of governing. What happened? Probably the first instance of the panoptic surveillance state, or at least the perceived version of one. (A watched person is more likely a well-behaved person, and if a giant invisible sky fairy has his eye on you, knowing whether you've been naughty or nice...)But I'm getting ahead of myself. People have been looking for the differences between humans and animals. Usually it is tool use, but, oh, sorry, culture in the form of technology predates humans. (So does society and war, by at least 100 million years).Mark Twain suggested that man is the only animal that blushes. Or needs to. I've suggested that man is the only animal that can choke on it's own vomit. Or needs to.But probably a defining difference is that man can throw things, and throw things more accurately than any other primate. Man uses ranged weapons, starting with rocks, and working up to rockets. Ranged weapons have an interesting egalitarian effect, not only against other predators, but amongst peoples. I don't need to be a big strong bully to take down another big strong bully. When I look at a hand axe, what looks like an ungainly and awkward two-pound piece of flint, I may see a not-particularly-great bashing weapon, but, with it's razor sharp flint edge and just enough heft, a very effective throwing weapon. Especially when a lion or what have you doesn't see it coming. Ow! Hey! Little monkey fucker!Ranged weapons are at least two million years old, and not coincidentally come into proper use with the emergence of Homo erectus. Now, the thing about homo erectus is they got the proper ball and socket shoulder joint, the musculature, and the big-brain eye-hand coordination to really whip that sucker hard. I mean, computer models suggest these guys and gals could easily throw a 100 mph fast ball, making most of today's MLB pitchers rather mundane.And that matters. It meant for a pretty evenly matched group of people. Throw in a moment arm multiplier like a spear shaft, and then an atlatl, and then a bow and arrow, and you have a great equalizer not seen until Samuel Colt came along. Turchin theorizes and provides evidence that hunter-gatherers were very egalitarian, and anthropological studies suggest that bullies or people trying to set themselves up as chiefs generally their asses killed by the rest of the tribe if they got out of hand. And so it was for 95% of out evolutionary and cultural history. It might explain why we don't like cheaters and bullies, and have so many institutional methods of keeping the alpha male in line.Then something happened. Multi-tribe chiefs appear (with their cohorts), and suddenly you have dictators, and inequality, god-kings demanding worship and tribute and human sacrifices. And war got worse. And worse. And you end up with these butt-holes getting monuments built to themselves.Whoops, I left out a step. Turchin notes that societal groups seem to have magic numbers. Beyond a certain number of people, a niche opens up that allows for bullies and their cohorts. (Remember, bullies cannot exist with a supporting cohort to surveil and suppress the rest of society).He points out that this depends somewhat upon geography. If there are geographic barriers that limit the size of the population, you can't reach that magic population number (not unlike Dunbar's number) , and you end up with small bickering clans, tribes, and chiefdoms. The classic case is New Guinea, small valleys separated by mountains. (Similarly dense jungle, or swamp, or islands). New Guinea, as far as can be determined, was colonized by people's possessed of the Neolithic cultural package, but never progressing beyond it. They've had 10,000 years of war. This might suggest Turchin's theory isn't all ti's cracked up to be. My thought is this points out that true driver of cultural change, aside from multi-level selection, is logistics. Which, of course, is what war is really about (not strategy and tactics). If the numbers aren't there to build up a structure which allows for an extended logistical behavior, you get stuck. Although you also have a ritualization of war in new Guinea. They never experience genocide per se. A clan may be wiped out, but never a whole tribe.This might suggest one variation of an answer to the Fermi Paradox. The aliens are out there, but they are stuck in eternal war.So, now back to the Axial Age. Turchin suggests that it was not the Enlightenment that resulted in a relative decrease in violence. Makes sense. The Enlightenment is used far too often by Western scholars, and besides, lots of incredibly despicable individual and mass behaviors occur, and continue to occur after the (ha!) Age of Reason. So fuck that noise.Turchin suggests that society as a whole, when it comes to structural inequality at least, that we've zigged, then zagged, then zigged back to some type of egalitarianism. I don't see it. Or if has happened, it's currently just a little zig back to a fair deal. Although, if the Ayn Rand delusional butt-hole parasites win, the ones that think they owe nothing to society or community, look for a very long, very Dark age of despotism. Coupled with parasitic panoptic technology, and human enhancement of all stripes and flavors, we may never get out of this dystopian Darkest of Dark Ages.Turchin is currently extolling the accumulation of a Big Data effort to compile all archaeological, anthropological, sociological evidence to, I guess, run some learning algorithms up against and see what pops out. I can't see this as a bad idea. Summarized report. Worth a skim.I think the magic number idea is worth pursuing. I think that there is no fractal structure here, because fractals work kind of well, but are not a true fit to nature, as self-similarity eventually breaks down (history don't rhyme either), and my suspicion is there is a magic population number that exists up in the high billions or maybe trillions that makes things zig again. Or zag. Hopefully zig."},
{"title": "Smash Mold", "date": "Friday, April 15, 2016", "text": "Johnny smash! Make art!So, I decided to get a handle on breaking molds before I play with dehydrating and breaking them. I took a donut from a Fischer Price donut stacker and made a mold of that. I broke the mold with a hammer and chisel.I put the mold in the kiln at 200F overnight to dry it so I could cast clay in it. I encased the mold in a plastic bag and slipcast the clay donut.I realized that things would move faster if I just cast it in wax. That way I wouldn't have to wait for the mold to dry out. So I embedded the slip cast clay in a plaster block, and bashed the crap out of the block.The wax I got out was the 2nd iteration of the smash mold, and it was getting difficult to remove the wax due to undercuts. So I was done with the donut.Then I cast a wax sphere into a plaster block, and smashed that.The plaster did not completely cure, so it really got fucked up, and I was only able to make a one iteration smash mold of the waxes before it fell apart.I was more careful on the next smash mold. I waited for the mold to cure, then used a little less brute force in smashing it.Cast the wax, embedded that in a plaster block, smashed that, and cast a second iteration wax.1st iteration on the rightI noticed there really isn't much of a change between iterations, but I ran out of time today. I will cast one of the 2nd iteration waxes in a mold and smash next week, but I got a feeling I've found the limits of the heuristic with just plain smashing.I can, of course, modify the waxes afterwards, and will, even though technically I am violating the rules of spontaneity."},

The researcher, Dr. Afsaneh Rabiei, and her staff have found that the inch thick armor plate - composed of a boron nitride ablative ceramic outer tile, impact absorbing composite metal foam, and Kevlar cloth backing - that it doesn't just stop armor piercing rounds, it obliterates them to dust.The game changing aspect, of course, is not that the material is great for personal bulletproof armor - although that is certainly application - but for space capsules and space stations, as it not only stops 7.62 armor piercing rounds, but also stops x-rays, gamma rays, and neutron radiation!Speaking of impacts. I went back to square one with the plaster. Bashing it with a hammer, and then later a hammer and chisel. The results are not impressive. But I do feel the need to understand this weird stuff better. My suspicion is, since plaster is an amorphous material held together by water, the impact velocity determines whether I get a fracture or a cleavage. I prefer cleavage, ah ha ha, but that is not as interesting a surface as a fracture.And from outer space to inner space, the first brain scans of people on LSD are in. It really is a pity that that megalomaniacal dickhead Timothy Leary fucked up research on psychedelic drugs for all the rest of us, and set practice back good fifty years where it should be, but they are finally doing serious research on the stuff. The fact that they got MRI scans of people on LSD is a major step forward, and will probably explain a lot, like dude why people's brains turn orange on acid.I remember having a dream one time that I was tripping, and it was the most intense visual hallucinatory experience I ever had. And then I woke up. Anyone want to tell me why me dreaming about tripping on acid was at least ten times better than any time when I  on acid?"},
{"title": "Breaking The Mold: Investigating Heuristics", "date": "Friday, April 8, 2016", "text": "I submitted an application for a residency at Kohler Art Center. My proposal was to produce objects from broken molds. I'm the one breaking the molds. The idea is to break them in interesting ways, and to somehow try to control the spontaneity of the breaking.Control the spontaneity. So, now that we are all done laughing...I've spent a good technical portion of my art career learning how not to break molds. Broken molds, when casting glass or metal, are very annoying.I've done a pretty good job of not breaking molds. But when molds do break, they produce some  rather interesting results, cracks, cracked surfaces, and leaks that, in glass and metal, are sometimes more interesting than the stuff I'm casting, or make the stuff I'm casting a little more interesting. True, at the moment when it happens, I'm not that thrilled, but later, in calmer circumstances, investigating the results, there is fun stuff going on.So basically, rather than wait for acceptance in a residency, and then just show up like a bumpkin and say, hey howdy, I'm going to break molds for two months, got any plaster? I decided to start now to get a handle on things and see what's what.The first thing I did was to take some old plaster molds and break them. Actually the first thing I decided to do was to produce objects in slip-cast clay or wax, as the feedback is immediate and turnaround time on making the next batch of molds is short, so I can go through many iterations of developing techniques pretty rapidly.So, I took two old molds from my wax casting library, and broke them. Then put them back together, then slip-cast clay into them. I wasn't sure what would happen afterwards, but I saved the objects by bisqueing them for documentation.I found it is really hard to break plaster. I mean, you really bash the shit out of it, which often results in total destruction. So, then I says, alright, this is probably a fork.(I bashed the above mold up, and slip cast the object, a balloon, which actually is a very creepy looking thing).Fork1: Either learn how to break plaster in a more gentle fashion, by tapping the plaster with a very large number of small impacts, or find a way to weaken the plaster.Uh, duh. When you heat plaster, the water, which is the thing holding the plaster, leaves, and makes the plaster weak. So, I put a mold into a kiln, took it up to 400F for 12 hours, and drove pretty much all the ager. Like 98% of the water.Success, but too successful, because now the mold is too weak for any of long term manipulation.So, another fork.Fork 2: Either play around with the firing schedule (in time and temperature), or make another mold of the object using the existing fracture lines as parting lines for a multipart mold.Today, I tried out fork 2, by making a plaster mold, and firing it up to 400F for 4 hours instead of 12. Success, in that mold lasted a little bit longer, but still fell apart. So, the plan is next to try firing the plaster mold up to 400F for two hours. And if that doesn't work, then firing the mold at a lower temperature.The plan is to go back and try out the other fork 1 next week, and of course, document, document, document.The object? Well, I had to change a burnt-out lightbulb, and said, hey as good as any object.Got a nice smooth surface, good recognizable form, with varied associations. So there we go."},

{"title": "The Yeehaw Center For Fancy Learnin'", "date": "Thursday, March 31, 2016", "text": "This title has nothing to do with this short essay. I just came up with it and it tickled me. So currently I am writing up art grant proposals. What a fucking pain in the ass. As someone who has always abhorred paperwork, you can imagine what a fun time I'm having. But, it's a necessity because getting into art shows is becoming increasingly difficult. Way too much content out there.A lot of the stuff I see the students making at the college is a good example. There is some cool stuff being made, but, as Theodore Sturgeon once said \"90% is crap\". Someone once responded that, well that means 10% is sublime. Nope. Maybe 1% is sublime, and that would be only with a fat-tailed Pareto distribution. Following a Gaussian distribution would put sublimity at .01%.So, a lot of the stuff I see getting cranked out here are just really horribly awkward things - shambling grotesques that should never have been summoned into existence. They really should be destroyed by fire. The destruction of some of them requires using all four classical elements.I, of course, am in no position to say anything in the way that be viewed as ridicule.The reasons are twofold. 1) is that a lot of my stuff is without a doubt crappy (see the 90% rule above), and 2) as an educator, I am kind of ethically bound to find a more diplomatic and constructive route to critique the stuff. In fact, rarely  - unlike the naked brutality of graduate-and-above level critiques - is anything ever made fun of... at least not in front of the student.There's actually a third reason. I've mentioned before that I am autistic. It's not an excuse for anything. I'm not feeling sorry for myself. After all, I've had a good 56 years to come up with coping strategies, and I'm still around and semi-successful at navigating our weird society.But as someone who does not instinctively and effortlessly pick up on social cues, I've had more than my fair share of ridicule. I'm not saying this to garner sympathy, I'm just stating it as a matter of course. What I am saying is that I can understand and empathize with how ridicule goes down.(Actually, one of my past coping strategies for ridicule is straight out of the Untouchables, Sean Connery's Malone: \"They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way!\" You give me a shot to the jaw, I'll try to send you into orbit. I'm getting much better at that, though, and especially in the last ten years. I've to learned to shrug it off and ignore belligerent assholes. Besides, I've found out that sometimes that belligerency is supposed to be in good humor).So anyway, I try to be a nice guy, because 1) As an educator, I'm paid to be nice, and 2) I'd like to be treated the same way, so you try to lead by example. Hmm. Got to work on that behind the back thing now, but that's also part of our weird society."},

But no, like Dr. Strangelove, I suppose I should stop worrying and learn to love the Bomb. You know, finally we achieve Peace In Our Time.And the increasing lack of civility suggests we may not even make it much past 2022. History provides plenty of examples.

The minute you have any kind of inequality, people have no reason to pitch in anymore, then it is every man for himself, devil take the hindmost, and the whole thing falls apart.Ayn Rand's Wet Dream.Morning In America - for some!Look, when cooperation itself is used as a disparaging term, society is in trouble.

Infantile types I suppose, the kind that needs a big strong man (or manly woman) to spoon them when things get scary.Seems to me that last thing this country needs is another Caesar. Certainly not the current crop of would-be Caesars. Despite the fact that so many in this country feel a need for a strong leader, one that will kick ass and bomb little brown people back to stones, the one thing the United States does not need is another Caesar. We've had Caesars at least since Kennedy.Is that what we really want? A strong leader? Yeah, I think so. It's not what what we need, but it is what we want. Despite the fact that the last century pretty much provided incontrovertible empirical proof - Hitler, Stalin, Mao, etc. - that strong leaders are rancid butt-holes that get a lot of people killed.And to cooperate requires sacrifice. One way I would prefer to do that would be to give up something we want to get something we need.

Back then, it was the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, the last time conditions were similar to today. They note, however, that this situation actually has no historical analogue, as the rate of the amount of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere is unprecedented within the geological record. What we are doing is entirely new and novel.As if that wasn't bad enough, James Hansen's new study suggests we are moving from the acceleration phase into the shock phase. There are, of course, no good predictions as to where it will go, but again, we are entering into entirely new territory.This is similar to predictions that the coming presidential election will look like Nixon/McGovern, or Carter/Ford. There is no reason to think this should be. After all, none of the conditions from then apply to now.That whole \"history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme\" quote has been attributed to Mark Twain.Twain never said that. If he had, he wouldn't have said it that way, as it reflects late 20th-/early 21st century English usage patterns, which is to say English not beyond a grade school vocabulary.

If you're making labor more expensive, and automation less expensive -- this is not rocket science,\" says Puzder. What comes as a challenge is automating employee tasks. This is where he draws the line and doesn't think that it's likely any machine could perform such work. But for more rote tasks like grilling a burger or taking an order, technology may be even more precise than human employees. \"They're always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there's never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case,\" says Puzder in regard to replacing employees with machines.First off, Carl's Jr is one of the worst burgers I've ever had. Carl's Jr. is like the Sears Roebuck of the burger world. In this respect, Andy Puzder reminds me of Herman Cain, another Randian butt-hole that ran a shitty food company, Godfather's Pizza. Fucking horrible pizza.Andy Puzder is way behind the times. Automating a specialist job like CEO is where we are headed. Clearly, automating Andy Puzder would be a lot more cost effective and better for the company.My reasoning? A Deep Learning robo-CEO will, by analyzing Big Data have a much better grasp of the business environment, is less likely to make stupid mistakes, is far more likely to correct the mistakes it makes, and will rarely say stupid shit like Andy Puzder does. You don't need stock options, bonuses, pension plans, penthouses, and prostitutes and hush money with a robo-CEO. The employees get a less volatile asshole boss to deal with that actually makes rational business decisions.Other things. I have had a lot of stuff completed all at once this past week.

Which is to say, is very very rusty!I really do mean: shaking my head in rueful admiration, gotta love the Russians. But the translation is more like \"It is necessary (for you) to love the Russians\". Not quite the same thing.So, there is room for improvement in the automation of human tasks. Give it time. So, what about the current state of democracy in the good 'ol US of A? I ask this because I voted yesterday, and quizzed a few people as to whether they did as week, and the answer I got was mainly no. It's too hard. Democracy is just too hard. These kids really do need an Alphago voting app. Something to think for them, because thinking is becoming too hard for people. But that's almost always been the case.That's why the Founding Fathers set up the elitist system that we have. Don't kid yourself. We aren't set up for equal opportunity anything. For all that 'We The People' horseshit, our system of government is set up to keep the average shit-covered peasant as far away as possible from the knobs, switches, and levers of actual power. The Founding Fathers just didn't trust your average sturdy yeoman... except to fight at their command. And we, like the stupid buttholes that we are, do exactly that.The Russians share that with us. They may be surly and taciturn, morose, and deeply superstitious, but they are profoundly brave and stoic in a way that makes your average American look like the vicious, whiny little brats that our displayed national character says we are. They will shrug their shoulders, and do what they are told.Not that their system of government is any better. Let's face it, until Velicky Peter came along, their model was the Ottoman Empire. Russia was, and is, an asiatic despotism. Until everyone had to adopt the ways of the French (and now, Americans. You wouldn't believe how many English words have crept into everyday speech there, like 'ta-oon ha-oozes'), they really preferred the opulent decadence of the satrapy.Democracy, in case you weren't around in the '90s, meant hunger, crime, and despair to your average Russian. From 1991 to 1995, the GDP of the former Soviet Union dropped 39%. I don't think anyone here can understand that. That's far worse than anything during the Great Depression. Under the increasingly incoherent and incompetent rule of Yeltsin, things really did suck. Oh, sure, you had vile criminals that were former Soviet officials. But the West came in and just raped the shit out of the whole country. And Slick Willy stood there and yucked and dug elbows into the pudgy side of Yeltsin while this all happened.Can you blame them for liking Putin? He helped set up the stable criminal syndicate that kept the raping and extortion down to a tolerable minimum, and then plus, prosperity started to happen. It's true that corruption is rampant, but that's been business as usual since the 1920s. But we really really did number on them, and your average American is completely and hopelessly clueless about that.Can you blame them for hating us just a little bit?"},

I'd look a lot more graceful if I just fell on my face.My younger brother Jim is the natural athlete of the family. Grace in motion, and probably because he doesn't think at all about what he is doing, just does it. Jim had to give up on sports because of bone spurs.

{"title": "Hubris", "date": "Friday, March 4, 2016", "text": "The Japanese celebrate the victory of the Battle of Tsushima: the naval battle between the Japanese fleet under Admiral Togo versus the Tsar's Second Pacific Squadron under Admiral Rozhestvensky during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5. Togo came out being called the \"Nelson of the East\". Two thirds of the Russian fleet was sunk.The war was held up to Japan as an exemplar and paragon for all future Japanese imperialist expansions to follow - a lesson in what bushido could accomplish, divine fate and blind faith in the Emperor. The Japanese learned this lesson of triumphalism well, to their future regret.Which is to say, they learned the wrong lesson. If you look at the war, it taxed the tiny island nation to the limit. Even the battle of Tsushima itself contained lessons Japan failed to learn. Admiral Togo, at the end of the battle, noted that the Japanese fleet could not have fought much longer. The ships were out ammunition and coal, the bores of the big guns on the Japanese battleships were worn out and needed to be replaced. The Japanese arms industry could not perform the task. Provisions and supplies were tapped out.In the greater war, the Japanese economy was nearing exhaustion, an irreplaceable and taxing 100,000 men had been killed taking Port Arthur, Mukden, and Manchuria. Russia, the biggest country in the world, was in the process of calling in fresh replacements. Japan was fortunate that Teddy Roosevelt intervened, else they would have had to sue for peace.So, the right lesson the Japanese failed to learn was to be taught again in World War II. They failed to build an effective system of logistics. They jumped into battle, poorly supplied, with no reserves of resources in place, a shoddy supply chain, no plans to expand or augment their supply chain, and in many cases, expected the warrior spirit of their people to win battles for them. In short, they operated on blind faith that past triumphs would be revisited upon them.What a bunch of fools.The American people would do well to study what happened to Japan in the first half of the 20th century, but we won't. In particular, those of a conservative bent, who accept the triumphalist lie of the end of the Cold War, will fail to learn the lesson provided. Which is, sorry folks: Cold War is still going on, we still have 5,000 Russian warheads pointed at us, the American people have proven themselves less than exceptional, and their boy Reagan was a vain foolish oaf who did nothing to end the Soviet Union.(Come on, a nation that survived both Stalin and Hitler taken down by a senile-in-office corrupt old dunce like Reagan? Give me a break. Look instead to the Bush clan's connection to the House of Saud, in lowering oil prices as, simultaneously, the Russian military bled the economy dry in achieving a short-lived parity with the US. Hmm. Lower oil prices, sure looking like the Saudis did for Obama to get Iran to the table).And now the conservatives are paying a price for not learning the right lesson. Which was: bankrupting ourselves, adding to the foul corruption of the military/industrial/congressional  complex, and acting upon the blind faith of American exceptionalism, and more importantly the tenants and moral fiber of the conservative mindset will somehow makes us prevail based upon imagined past triumphs.You can only be delusional for so long before reality catches up with you, and I believe this is the beginning of reality catching up with at least portion of the benighted conservative domain known as the GOP.Have fun being tangled up in your filth-ridden malarial bedclothes and fever dreams, GOP.

{"title": "The Haunting of Hillary House", "date": "Thursday, February 25, 2016", "text": "I debated naming this essay \"President Donald Trump\" because right now that's where we are headed.  And this may be my only political essay of the year.And I really don't have anything to say about Hillary other than she manages to make herself pretty scary without even trying.Well, I could mention The Haunting, the 1963 film that scared the piss out of me when I was a kid. (Wow, who'd have thought that acting, music, and cinematic atmospherics could beat the living shit out of special effects, but it can). Hillary reminds of that house. She's got demons in her, and I hate to think what she does to Bill behind closed doors (not that he doesn't deserve it).Okay, I'll tell you one alleged story I heard third-hand and so can only call apocryphal (hope this covers me legally, and if not, I'll say YOU wrote this). A friend of a friend was working for a hospital board that Hillary was on. He arrived early to the meeting, needed to arrange his notes, and so spread them out on the table to work. Hillary arrived, and told him that chairs at the table were for Board Members Only, and he would have to take a seat in one of the chairs up against the wall. No hello. No hi who are you, my name is Hillary, who are you? Just full-on immediate officious little bitch. The guy has hated her ever since.But what we have to look forward to - so far - is President Donald Trump. If Republicans are upset about this, they have only themselves to blame. This is what happens when you scare white people too frequently. Matt Taibbi has an excellent article in Rolling Stone on Trump and our current sick reality show known as American politics. I recommend reading it at least for the laughs.\"(Cruz)'s against everything all at once. Welfare! Corporations! Special Interests! Government! The Establishment! He's that escort who'll be into whatever you want, for an hour\".Taibbi gets a lot right in this analysis. The American Empire is revealed to be just a big high school. Many view Trump as the senior class bully, or BMOC, pretty much the same. We have to be careful here, though. If you are going to be a bully and are humorless, then you're just a goon, and everyone is afraid of you. You have to be funny, and occasionally appear to be merciful, in order to be an effective popular bully. Trump is a funny guy. Trump knows reality TV. Trump understands that a TV Tard Nation deserves a TV Tard President, and he can deliver on that.At this stage, now probably our 139th year of empire (our nation has always had aspirations, because we are England v2.0, or Rome v5.3, but I'm guessing the empire started with the end of Reconstruction, and the closing of the frontier around 1877), is it any surprise that we have the politics we have?We had our Julius Caesar in Dallas 1963, so maybe it's time for Caligula."},
{"title": "Clunky Kluge-riddled Dreams", "date": "Tuesday, February 23, 2016", "text": "I had a dream last night that I had a contest of supremacy with a group of pirates. We battled on a hockey rink, with household objects as weapons. I prevailed with a pair of scissors. Others did not do so well with less dangerous objects, like measuring tape and ironing boards and coat hangers.We were all on ice skates, and the hockey rink was surrounded by fog, so maybe this was all a race memory of good times on the North Sea a thousand years ago. Although I was never much of a skater. I have to concentrate to skate backwards.So, when I won the top dog position, the prize was to confront an even bigger crowd of pirates of Tripoli on the Mediterranean Sea. I made a speech. I said \"I go now as your chosen wolf. I have no doubt that I will die. I am not afraid to die, but I would more gladly die if you choose to join me, and together we win the Mediterranean!\" I was greeted with a manly roar, and then I woke up.Not exactly Henry V, but I felt pretty good about it. The idea of challenging the pirates of Tripoli with household items and prevailing made me feel pretty good about myself. Not sure why. Why the Tripoli pirates? Why a fog enshrouded hockey arena? Well, that, I think is a distant childhood memory of skating in the fog, which is just so fucking cool.Really don't know what the heck goes on with dreams. For sure the brain processes events from the prior day, but what a weird and metaphorical way to do it. There are some who believe that dream realms are actually other realms. If the universe is infinite and unbounded, then I would say the existence of dream realms is a certainty. Because, you know, infinity.Regardless, I had a friend who was checking out the waxes for the Smoketaker. He said my work was Thomas Hart Benton meets HR Giger. I think I got Hart's rubbery figures down, but not so much Giger's bodily transgressions and oral sexuality. I suppose he meant biomechanoid aspects, but even then, I don't really pursue that to any serious degree. My stuff is more about ordinary folks forced through circumstance or profession to awkwardly or clumsily deal with biomechanical prostheses.Interesting, despite at least a solid million years of tool use, how maladroit we are sometimes with technology. You'd figure it would be seamless, and I suppose it is once you just quit thinking and start doing, but I'm amazed how even the most accomplished technologist can occasionally come across as if he or she has never seen a tool in their life.You know, the all thumbs, the ham-handed, the butterfingered, the graceless and inept performances that we beach apes are occasionally prone to. And it happens not just with objects, but with ideas. We apprehend ideas that same as we do objects after all, with the exact same sensory and mental processes.It's how we are equipped. We grasp a concept, we get a handle on things, we get a taste for meaning, we don't like the smell of it, we feel it's right, we see where you are going with it, we have a good ear for things.So, I suppose, manipulating ideas, even though we've had at least a good solid million years doing it, can still display the same inept gracelessness that we occasionally display with objects.Which, I suppose could explain these clunky dreams."},

{"title": "Starship Troopers", "date": "Wednesday, February 17, 2016", "text": "Starship Troopers paperback jacket art by Paul LehrEvery three or four years, I'll pick up a book from the library on the Great Pacific War, that portion of WWII that involves Japan. I do it for a number of reasons, but I suppose one reason it is a way to live a part of my father's life vicariously. He served in the latter part of the war on a LST, or, in Navy parlance, Large Slow Target.The book I'm reading now is The Conquering Tide by Ian W. Toll. It's a good book, and I find myself picking it up and reading it over all the many other things I really ought to be doing. I'm currently up to the amphibious invasion of Kwajalien in the Marshall Islands, so that would be January of 1944, which is 72 years ago. There is still a year and a half of unadulterated viscousness still to go through before we bomb the crap out of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (after we bomb the crap out of the rest of Nippon).I'm constantly reminded throughout of how much Robert A Heinlein stole took the whole island-hopping-across-the-vast-Pacific campaign and turned it whole cloth into the novel Starship Troopers.The Japs are bugs, vermin, aliens. Even the Korean slave labor are referred to by our Marines as 'termites'. Why, there is even an ultimate weapon at the end of the novel that fills in for the a-bomb: the Nova bomb, that \"can crack planets like eggs\".The one thing that Heinlein doesn't have (and this is actually rather distinctive of the SF genre running well into the '70s at least) is the idea of modern warfare. It's all, well, basically, 17th century warfare. Ships and men. Ships and men. From Star Trek to Star Wars, its all sailing ships pummeling each other, and armies of men in formation pummeling each other. Classic cutting edge Napoleonic stuff, but not where our real wars have taken us. So why the reactionary romanticism? Well, it's an easier plot, with black and white characters.What does Heinlein leave out from the Pacific War? Well, air power for sure. Radar, radio, and the inevitable command and control situation that appeared aboard carriers. And logistics. Holy shit. Logistics. You had more than just an immense baggage train of supplies behind the American Navy. Logistics went scientific. But who wants to watch the service machinations in Star Wars? Who wants to watch rooms full of women solving simultaneous linear equations, optimizing Markov chain decisions, with reams of paper at wooden desks? They barely made a tolerable historically inaccurate movie about just the code-breaking aspect in The Imitation Game, which was just an awful, manipulative ham-handed movie.So, we got ships and mechanically enhanced men in the 22nd century, zooming around the galaxy, but it's still the 17th century at least. How would Heinlein include the arms race of air power (planes and their platforms, and their service and support ships), and air defense (anti-aircraft, radar, and command and control)? The only thing Heinlein could have done would have been highly unscientific.He would have to include angels and demons, ghosts and angry spirits in his novel. That's what air power was back then. Avenging angels from on high, or demons harassing men below. Ghosts (as the Japs did with night attacks) invisible until they strike. There is no corresponding allegorical agent Heinlein could have used. Except one which he would found have unpalatable. Some kind of trans-human superhero.Air power. One thing that struck me in the Conquering Tide was an account of a pilot who was shot up, forced to parachute into the water, resigned to being at sea for days or weeks, but instead picked up by a destroyer and returned to his carrier in time for lunch.Let's walk through this. He's flying a Grumman F6F Hellcat, an incredible machine compared to the flimsy planes prior to WWII. It's armored, it's powerful, it's deadly.It's a monster.And he pilots this mechanical monster until he is shot down by another mechanical monster. And then he rescued by a still more enormous mechanical monster, and delivered back to his still even more enormous mechanical mother monster, to be fed like a pupa until his next monster hatches out of the bowels of his metal mom and he climbs in and pilots that some more.And now I wonder, is the 17th century model when mechas got started? Or do we go all the way back to the 6th century BC, Art of War stuff? Or before? Mechas, of course, are giant anthropomorphic robots piloted by people. Usually one person pilots it, but there may be more servicing an even larger  mecha. It's the juggernaut. The Nautilus with Captain Nemo. A sailing ship, with a hierarchy of men crewing it as one, is a holistic monster. Ships predate nation states and city states, but that nautical first instance seems to be the model. Which, via the mecha, gets us to Heinlein's trooper in powered and armed exoskeleton suits.But no real monsters. I wonder if this is part of the reason I make the art I make. I know I talk about monsters a lot, but we sure do seem determined to create them. Almost a compulsion.Bees make honey.Ants make roads.Men make monsters."},

A lot of them will tell you it was the development of language that caused it.Oh, bullshit.It was our partnership with wolves that did it. The domestication of the wolf into dog, creating a coevolutionary symbiotic species partnership, is what created lots of leisure time. (Not to mention helping us domesticate herd animals). As a result, with more time on our hands, we could create art and music and dance and all the other stuff they figure was cultural sophistication.But it was dogs. Hands down, best explanation for the Great Leap Forward.My brother had to put his dog down. He's sad about it, but as one friend put it gently, \"Bob had it coming\".That's true. Boston terriers live pretty long as dogs go, and Bob, despite problems, had pushed the envelop pretty seriously.I drank a toast to Bob last night. I toasted him, then I roasted him.He was an ugly dog, a bug-eyed little shrimp. Bob the dog had the worst farts that are humanly possible. Bob the dog stretched the definition of symbiosis to the breaking point. Never was there a more worthless dog. He snored like a freight train. He overheated easily, what with that short snout. So, you'd wind him up, get him chasing stuff, and within a minute he's in danger of brain damage from overheating. I'm pretty sure Bob was brain damaged.Bob the dog  was also called Robert the canine. He knew he had two names. I called him Robert the canine. Whenever anyone else said Robert the canine, he would look around for Uncle John. \"Uncle John's here?\"I would greet him and say \"Hello my friend! Yes, yes! You are a fine fellow!\", and he was a fine fellow.Fare thee well, Bob. Hie thee to the Dog Star."},
{"title": "Some Different Stuff", "date": "Monday, February 8, 2016", "text": "My weekend boss, Newman, has been doing some really fantastic materials investigations using balloons and fiberglass resin. He constrains a balloon with various bands, like, rubber bands, cable ties, etc. He then fills the balloons with fiberglass resin or a two-part urethane plastic, rolls them to get the material filmed over the inside of the balloon, then they cure, and he removes the balloon.His ultimate goal is 8 foot weather balloons squeezed and constrained into interesting shapes, but his first investigations are proof of concept. You end up with these rather amazing looking hollow amber surfaces, sometimes. Sometimes the balloon pops during curing, and then it is a mess.Some of the forms he made, kind of boobs and butts, and bondage themes to them, are just too cool not to steal.So, like Picasso, I stole.I did these today. Balloons partially inflated and bound with rubber bands and cable ties. They were spray painted with primer, then red, then flat black.

Inwardly though, I was quite pleased. It's always nice to take these timid little fragile baby birds and get them toughened up enough to leave the nest. When I get shit back from my students, I know I'm doing a good job. And that's just one of my jobs.I got a twenty year plan. Not that I think I'm gonna die in 2036, just that I figure I've at least twenty years left of a semi-vigorous and productive old age. I'm assuming I've got probably at most 20 years to get shit done the way I want it done.(I'm figuring 2038 is when I die, and that's sounds like a good year. Providing, of course the 2020s don't suck the way they sure look like they will, in which case there goes the twenty year plan).Had this been one hundred years ago, the year 1916, I'd have been dead three years on. Death by \"the stone\". Kidneys all swolled up and failed in a months-long lingering horrible kind of death by internal poisoning and drowning. That puts a necessary perspective and focus on things, and thus the need for things like twenty year plans.Not that I have a plan. I'm winging it as I go. It's more a realization that I need to quit dicking around and start to drill down on shit.  What is it I want to do? Because, here's the other thing, I don't have time for anything! I don't understand how people get the time to read all the books and articles, watch all the TV, movies, stage plays (like Hamilton) and such that they do.I would love to do all stuff, but the next thing I know, it's the next day and I've accomplished only (n/2) - 1 of the n things I had to do.I mean, part of the reason for having the plan is time management. And apparently, what I'm finding out is worrying about technique is not part of the plan.I'm working on a semi-commission in cast glass. (Semi- because the client may choose to revoke the commission. He wanted a cast glass version of the Stockmen, and I said, no can do. I can make a bas relief of it, and then said, no I can't, but I can do separate glass panels that are kind of based upon the Stockmen theme. Which makes me think I should do a cast glass comic strip with cast glass panels... which I don't have the freaking time to explore. Or maybe I do).The StockmenNow, there are techniques for casting glass. I've been told many times to wet pack an investment mold with glass. That's how it's done. I have neither the time nor the patience to do that, so I just dry pack 'em. As a result, I have trouble coloring within the lines. Well, actually, I am evolving techniques of dry packing for more precise borders, but the fact of the matter is the technique is not a real high priority.So, have a look:Kind of sloppy looking, but no one else seems to mind. I suppose other glass casters might shake their heads at this, but... I'm really more concerned with presentation. I like a certain amount of back lighting, but I think pieces work better without the back lighting.An inconsistency, given that glass is supposed to be about color and light and translucency.You know I'm just gonna keep on plugging at it."},
{"title": "Humans are nice by default?", "date": "Thursday, February 4, 2016", "text": "There's an old joke about a viking whose buddies go to meet him at the local drinking lodge, or at somebody's long house or some such place where feasting and drinking is going on.The friends walk into the place, and everyone in the place is dead. It's just blood and guts and severed limbs all over the floor and walls, and the viking is standing in the middle of it all holding his dripping broadsword.And they go \"What the hell happened here\"? The viking replies \"This guy (holding up a severed head) insulted me, and I didn't want to embarrass him in front of all his friends\".I appreciate the joke, having been inculcated in a culture of quiet psychopathy. Norwegians are quiet peoples who are taught not to brag. This kind of limits responses when it comes to bluster and the whole threat escalation thing. It basically goes from zero to slaughter with nothing in between*. This is not to say that northrons are unique in basic savagery, just that other cultures have come up with ways  that don't automatically result in mass homicide as the only solution to life's little problems.Take for example, Black Jesus:(Yes, that's the venerable Keith David as Reverend Otis of the Church of Jesus Christ in Compton humiliating Black Jesus in front of the congregation. I love the talent that has been attracted to this series).  First off, Vic bullies Black Jesus with the funny \"aboriginal conman\" opening line, and then Reverend Otis commences to savage Black Jesus with funny insults. And Black Jesus just takes it and leaves.Why doesn't the Son of God kick righteous ass?Now, of course, Black Jesus has to be a little constrained and do the turn the other cheek bullshit, but I can't help but think that reason he doesn't respond to these threat displays is 1) he knows he's in the right and things are going to work out in the end, and 2) humans are fundamentally nice and would prefer, if at possible, to avoid conflict even in conflict situations.I'm gonna submit, on the basis of watching lots of episodes of Nature, that actually, most animals would prefer to be nice. It's just the path of least resistance. Conflict requires a lot of time and energy, and if it can be avoided, or deflected through deceptive threat displays, so much the better.It doesn't always work that way, but advantages can be gained by other means. There was an episode of Nature where an orphaned monkey was adopted by another species of capuchins. The head capuchin monkey would bully the orphan. The orphan, twice of the size of the head monkey, could easily have beat it down, but did not. Why? Well, the orphan lived with other monkeys too. They liked him, sympathized with him, and would undoubtedly fear him if he wiped the jungle floor with the head capuchin monkey.Alright so maybe nice is wrong word. How about appearing nice? If we view social interactions as patterns of mutual abuse rather than of a shared utility, appearing nice has some decidedly distinct advantages.Beat downs can be useful. I remember once in college, there was a boxing craze when the first Rocky movie came out. The study lounge on the dorm floor was turned into a boxing ring for awhile. I was in there one day, and two football players decided to do some practice sparring. After the one hulking bruiser had pummeled his buddy into submission, the buddy left and it was just me and the lineman in the lounge. He asked if I wanted to go a few rounds, and I said \"Sure why not\". It wasn't like the fight scene in Cool Hand Luke where George Kennedy demolishes Paul Newman, but I went along long enough to end up with a split lip and a slightly puffy face. (It was an interesting intellectual exercise as to how to go about dealing with someone who outclasses you in every department of physicality. I didn't come up with general solutions, but it did give me the insight that there are other options besides brute force and frontal assaults). There was no animosity between us prior to this, but we got along a lot better afterwards, and hippy boy me got lot less shit from the other football players on the floor.Some were actually nice to me."},

Not people who want to get wild. People who need to get loose and some fun. People who need a little tropical vacation about this time.So, here's my proposal, we reimagine Yule. Yeah, I know Yule traditionally happens around Christmas, but pagan Yule? They partied until mid-January. So, we reboot Yule to take place the last weekend of January. We get Monday off.

Amongst the scraps of paper I keep notes on, I found one scrap that had the single name \"Lavoy Finicom\" on it. Misspelled (Finicum) as I was watching the news with no text reference at the start of the botched Bundy Heist. I wrote the name down because I said to myself, this dumb fucker is gonna get them all killed.(Yes, the Bundy Heist. It was a failed heist, a robbery gone wrong, due to the soft-headed poor planning of pudgy wobble-headed crackers who relied entirely too much upon faith for success. Couple this with your standard Western motif, and every single wrustler, bandit, and thief that ever stole anything in old West would sneer with contempt at the bumbling incompetence displayed. Americans generally will give practically anyone a second chance, but if there is one thing Americans have a hard time forgiving, it's incompetence).Now, the fact that I wrote down this name on a scrap of paper with this particular insight isn't a case of amazing psychic ability. I remember I found the name interesting, and reading up on what this guy has said and done, I used plain old logical deduction that here is a guy who would rather face a hail of sharp-pointed bullets than a single lawyer with a single pointed question. He just knew he wouldn't be able to handle the court time and prison time without coming up wanting and looking a dumb yokel. I think there is a certain amount of presumption (we all have it after all, that core of iron in us) in what he did, and I respect as I would any human being, but it still means that he and the rest of the Bundy Gang deserve nothing more than mocking contempt and cruelest ridicule.I mean, what a fucked-up venture this whole thing was! Not even clever in the least! And I am sure a bunch of dumb fucking jellyheads with the infantile authoritarian delusion of being in the right will make some kind of half-assed hare-brained video to try to color these buffoonish kleptomaniacs as patriotic citizens. And I'll tell you right now that this documentary on the Bundy Heist will be just the most ham-handed god-awful piece of crap propaganda piece that you will never wish to see.

A nice little measure from Mother Nature to take of a pesky parasite with as little collateral damage as possible - certainly a lot better than a nuclear war.So, let's trend outward 20 years, and let's say Zika mutates to that it is not just fetuses that get mutilated in their epigenesis, but everyone in their ongoing daily epigenesis gets mutilated. Why then, those areas that have mosquitoes that are the best carriers, Aedes aegypti, have the highest percentage of pinheads. Pinhead Congress. Pinhead White House.President Pinhead"},
{"title": "I'm Gonna Die", "date": "Friday, January 22, 2016", "text": "The second you start thinking of yourself as an animal is the second you become a lot less neurotic.Couple of nights ago, I'm watching an episode of Nature entitled Natural Born Hustlers. This episode, the 2nd of 3 entitled the Hunger Hustle, had a segment that blew me away. Monkeys would steal stuff from tourists. The thing that blew me away was the monkeys would give up the stuff for food.Meaning 1) monkeys could abstract reason the concept of value, 2) monkeys had a theory of mind that the stuff could be ransomed, and 3) the monkeys had a concept of reciprocation, they bartered the stolen items for food.Is it really that surprising that animals could be so sophisticated? Hell, no. We are animals. We just have a hard time admitting it. But once you do, life gets a lot simpler, things get less scary, and you, my dear little fellow animal, can act with more ease and grace in your daily life.Consider: I wrack my brain for ideas. What will I make next? It's not a question of finding things to make. There are tons of those. It's a question finding things that are cool to make. What do I want to devote my precious, precious time to? What if an idea doesn't pan out? What if thing is not how I envioned it, due to practicality or ineptitude? What if I waste my time?Relax. Just fucking do it. And if you waste your time, it's your time to waste.So, there's a competition coming up called Bullseye Emerge. It's for people who are not represented by major galleries, so I can participate. This juried entry, like the Corning Glass Review, is something I never get in. I considered submitting my usual cast glass piece, but then said Hey, hang on.I went back and looked at my last and latest mold failure, and said, why not submit this? In fact, why not use the accident to create a purposeful failure?I was staring at this image last night:Tentatively Titled 'Crop Failure'And I said, there's a lot of things I like about this. The glass flow is nice. The edges are nice. The fragile brittle thin (or broken and missing) sections look good against the thicker more solid pieces. I can't create this purposefully, but I can harness the mold failure to make a nice glass flow. (Bullseye actually has a video and a class called Harnessing the Flow that involves stacking glass on a ramp, and letting heat and gravity produce the forms). The flow can be controlled to some extent. So why not create a mold failure to semi-control the flow?The other thing I like about the image, one that I use a lot, is frame breaking. Breaking the border of the piece. It makes it more interesting, especially the ragged bottom edge. I'd be hard pressed, once again, to come up with such an interesting line had I tried to do this on purpose. So, let the glass do it for me!Third, it's true the piece is ephemeral and, actually, non-existent, now in the trash. So what? Nowadays, in our digital age, documentation and provenance of an art piece are worth more than the art piece. The metadata is worth more than the data.I'm going to do this again, but build a plaster/silica tray to hold the mold and recover the glass, rather than it spilling all over the kiln shelf, and see if I can do an intentional mold failure.If I make a series of glass objects that I document and then trash, what's the problem? There is evidence of a glass piece, even though it's gone now. Plus, there is a certain element of freedom in going against every stricture of glass casting. Molds aren't supposed to break. Glass thicknesses should be kept uniformly close, soaks and ramps must be followed to keep the glass stable.I don't care. As long as it lasts long enough to be documented, what's the problem?It's liberating, freeing myself of the collective neuroses of proper glass technics. And even better, since I'm well-versed in mold making, I can justify breaking the mold."},

Wasn't that why Rome fell? Too much lead in the water? That's the folktale. Most say, true, the amount of lead in Roman tap water was 100 times that of the spring water sources, but the levels were still low. On the other hand, you can find a lot of scientists who say even ridiculously low levels of lead in blood are harmful to IQs.An article on Vox points out, forget Flint, every major city has a lead problem. Think of all the urban gardens in shitholes like Brooklyn (now considered 'cool', if 'cool' is a synonym for shithole), where urban parents feed fresh lead-filled veggies to their children. Concentrated lead-filled veggies from the lead-filled soil, courtesy of automobile exhaust.This is the result of the \"no-knock\" leaded gasoline. Don't you think it odd that, some 36 years or so later after they 'got the lead out', gas pumps still say 'unleaded'? Further evidence of cultural tardation?  And all that lead spewed out of tailpipes eventually sank back down to earth, into the soil and water, and then into your little developing baby brain. And mine, which is why I'm tarded too.(This kind of sounds like, if only Rome hadn't fallen, we'd have had no Dark Ages and we would two hundred years ahead of where we are now. Which, I guess, means WWIII would have taken place in 1834).Hey, speaking of which, don't you think all that radioactive fallout also tarded us up some? But I distract myself.The hypothesis is that there is a connection between a drop in crime and the end of the use of leaded gasoline. I know this sounds like some of bullshit freakonomics thing, but it is compelling.At the very least, don't you think that lead-filled water, or chewing lead paint chips, would go a long way to explain that dumb fucking whore Sarah Palin and her slutty, drunk, stupid kids?"},

It won't be that bad to clean up the kiln shelf. I'll do that Tuesday when I come back.Managed to slice a pinhead-sized flap of flesh out of my middle finger manipulating the glass mold. It's amazing how painless and easy that is. Bled like a stuck pig.So, I cleaned up the piece anyway to see how it went. Not good.The jelly-monster was exactly as I wanted it, and the face and arm of the guy turned out how I wanted it. But the hat and shirt was no good.

{"title": "Autism and Neoteny", "date": "Thursday, January 14, 2016", "text": "Let's look at a baby skull.According to some theories, evolution has a trick called neoteny, wherein juvenile or infantile characteristics are continued into adulthood.The classic example is the comparison of baby chimps to adult chimps to adult humans. You can see that baby chimps look more human than adult chimpanzees do. So the idea is, there was a mutation, or a suite of mutations, that resulted in retaining baby chimp characteristics. (Or rather the baby characteristics of the shared ape ancestor of chimps and hominids).This resulted in the split between genus pan and genus homo.David McCallum as the next step in human evolution, according to The Outer LimitsWhich I guess means that the 'alien greys', the adult-sized fetal humans first seen in the sci-fi TV show The Outer Limits, is where our post-human future lies.Yeah, no. Not unless a) birth canal and pelvis sizes change so that the already dangerous childbirth of humans is made less dangerous for giant big head babies (meaning big giant fat asses on women, the so-called steatopygian trend) occurs, or b) preemie babies allow for head growth outside of the womb, or c) the advent of artificial wombs.But, no, when you consider that the brain already accounts for 20% of the metabolism of a human body, it's difficult to see how a bigger brain is possible. In fact, a lot of the neuro-psychological problems we see in anatomically modern humans suggest we've hit a design limit.Of course, my theory is these neuro-psychological problems (schizophrenia, autism, bipolar, depression, etc), probably all sharing a root cause or cause are actually not bugs but features.My theory is that autism is merely neoteny gone wrong. I'm hazarding, for lack of a better description, that we modern humans are autistic homo heidelbergensis. Autism, promoted through the wrong environmental cues, is embedded in the suite of mutations that resulted in modern homo sapiens, and thus, autism is probably as old as modern humans, some 200,000 years old.In other words, autism is not a modern affliction, and not a modern plague. It's as old as we are, it is a neotonous result that, rather than manifesting as a physical neoteny, is instead a psychological one.I, of course, am not the first to suggest this. Having a brain that remains plastic and adaptable well into adulthood would, for a generalist species, be of an advantage - in any environment.This does not mean that people in the autism spectrum are superior mutants, not the X-men or mutated superheroes of our juvenile comic books. It just means that we humans, all of us, have innate savant skills as a result of this suite of mutations, and sometime this can go wrong, and one example is autism.In case you didn't know, I am in the autism spectrum. And if you've reading my essays with any regularity, you probably are too. (I no longer use the term high-functioning Asperger's syndrome, as that is now defunct according to psychologists. But, I took the test, and I came up 'borderline', which I interpreted as 'normal', which of course is not true at all, I'm weird and quirky as hell, but allow me my conceits).Well, I am now convinced that we becoming an autistic society. Our culture is more childlike, our institutions geared more towards accommodating people within the spectrum, even if they are not. We don't wear adult clothes anymore. We tolerate childish behavior. We adapt our materiality towardsI believe George Carlin called this the \"pussification of America\". I don't necessarily think that all of this is part and parcel to Carlin's complaint, but what I see could be interpreted as such.So, is this a bad thing? The one thing I have noticed about people on the spectrum is, they can be adults, they can be productive adults, and in fact (if you look at Los Alamos, or NASA, or Silicon Valley) incredibly productive adults.Where do we go from here?"},

I suppose, if I were them, I'd want the land back, plus a money settlement to fix the vandalism incurred to Mt. Rushmore (irony, named after one of the first mooching land grabbers).(Now, you know the deal about the Black Hills, right? I mean, aside from being sacred land, the hills are also act as a rain generator, and nice place to have in a land that can become quite arid). We seem to forget that the Federal government set all these white settlers up to begin with - and with some major subsidies: cheap land, cheaper water, protection, roads, railroads, electricity, you name it. It's true it's a hard life, but compared to whose? Your average rancher lives a pretty soft life compared to pastoralists around the world, not to mention in the past. You don't see Mongols getting all this nice free stuff from the government.Well, maybe it's time to give the Indians the land back. Well, maybe just land west of the Mississippi. Maybe this admittedly minor news item about the Bundy gang occupying federal land might come to some good after all.Let me ask you this, if tomorrow, the Federal government turned over all its land to the various tribes, what would happen? Would anything happen? I'm guessing mostly no. I'm guessing the Indians would ask some people to leave some areas, but the existing bureaucracy does fairly good job of land management and stewardship, there would be no immediate reason to replace or abandon it.My understanding is, yes, absolutely there is a little heavy-handedness in regulating on the part of the  Feds. But I also understand they and the ranchers have done a good job cooperating on land stewardship. So, part of what happens is the grazing fees could go into existing money accounts for the tribes. Government could actually work for a people that we tried to exterminate.There would be problems, but honestly, how would this be a bad thing?"},

I figured gold was what they were after, or maybe oil or uranium or something, and that would explain the whole criminal enterprise, but no. Deposits of quaternary sediment, fine loess ground by glaciers, and that's about it.There is gold further north in the lava plains, but nothing special near or around Lake Malheur. I've spent some time in that area. Camping out in the Seven Devils region of the Snake River further north, and driven through Burns on my way from Bend to Boise.Sage country. High desert. Rolling hills. I drove through there about this time of year, sunlight glistening off ice-rimed sage bush. Pretty. I shot firearms from my vehicle on highway 20, because I got clued in by all the shot-up highway signs, and said what the hell if you can't shoot firearms from your moving vehicle out here, just where the hell can you shoot firearms from a moving vehicle?Oh. Chicago. Never mind.Anyway, because I do view the Bundy Gang as sanctimonious yokel amateur parasites*, the inevitable pitiful result of the Cheap Food for Cheap People policy the US of A has pursued lo these past 150 years, reaping obscene profits from public lands at taxpayer expense, I reckoned that was their angle.

{"title": "My GREAT Holiday Break", "date": "Monday, January 4, 2016", "text": "Actually, my holiday breaks are always fantastic, so this one was not unusual. Ate too much, drank too much, slept in late. It was glorious.The week before Christmas my niece came into town from KC, with her baby. We stayed up until 2am that first night, laughing and being stupid. During the week before Christmas, my brother and I fell into the habit of late night walks. We walked all over the place, visited the old neighborhoods.At one time, we ran into an old neighbor of ours a couple of doors down from our childhood home, who didn't recognize us. Once we told him who we were, he got a look on his face, like, oh yeah, you hoodlums.Probably the best walk was on Christmas Eve. Actually, a lot of stuff happened Christmas Eve. Earlier in the week, my niece wanted to go see Star Wars. I said sure, when. She wanted to do it Christmas Day, so I got online for tickets, and... sold out. How about Christmas Eve? We scheduled in the 9pm show.We had our big dinner around 6. Beef tenderloin, baked potatoes and corn. Pineapple upside-down cake for desert.Afterwards, we sat in the living room. My great-niece decided I needed prettying up. She kept a putting a plastic necklace on me, then stood back, looked, rearranged the necklace. Must have gone on for a half hour, and I was later praised for my patience. I later mentioned to my mom that it was kind of cute how she was kind of grooming my hair like a chimp. My mom told me... she was trying to clip a bow in my hair.Star Wars I talked about. It was fun because I was with my niece. Afterwards, at around midnight, we went back home and my brother was waiting for a walk. \"Let's go down to the swamp\" I said.I should point that I had an extremely fortunate childhood, in that the four street subdivision development we grew up in had forests and fields in every direction. South of us was a swamp that we used to fish and swim in during the summer, skate on and play hockey on in the winter. There was a patch of forest near the shore, where we built forts and tree houses. One big old oak we dubbed Big Moe.Everything has been developed now, save for the swamp, which they are draining. Christmas Eve night was windy as hell. Clouds whipping by at an amazing pace, and the moon nearly full.We walked down, and after a little disorientation due to the fact that the shoreline receded, we found the forest patch. Big Moe was gone. Just a huge upturned mound of black dirt where the rotted stump had been, and new path of new growth where the tree had fallen.But the Cunt Tree was still there! Called such due to a large lightning strike gash on the side that had healed over into a vagina. We leaned up against the tree on the leeward side of the trunk, and watched the forest sway above us. (That wind was the remnant of the hurricane from Mexico). It was a magic, spooky, witchy moment.Well, then Christmas Day, and everyone took off for KC. Went to dinner up in Michigan with friends of mine, and I had the most decadent fettucini steak alfredo I've ever had.I wish for death by steak alfredo."},
{"title": "Star Wars The Force Awakens: A Review", "date": "Monday, December 28, 2015", "text": "Give Disney time, and it will own our entire freaking childhood.Disney is buying up content like crazy. They are clearly afraid that their current portfolio of franchise content will not engage.I didn't want to see this movie. The only reason I went was because my niece wanted to recreate the family movie outing, and I was not going to ruin that for her. So, right off, the one positive thing I got out of this movie, is that it puts a positive spin and a positive message about family. Yes, it's action, and there are new characters which are retreads of old characters, but it has a good message about the importance of moms and dads and grandmas and grandpas (without which, we humans would have become extinct a long time ago). So, I'll give Disney that, at least they recognize a true value system, even if the conclusion was derived via marketing.During the holiday, my brother and I did quite a few late night walks around the area. I would note that one house I passed by had lit up Christmas decorations entirely owned by Disney. They owned everything except for Santa and the reindeer.Disney was all over the Force Awakens. Many have pointed out that JJ Abrams, a fan of Star Wars,  created a fan movie of Star Wars. I would point out it was a heavily market-researched fan movie. It takes no risks, stays solidly within the canon of the franchise, is bereft of characters, filled to the brim with phony archetypes, does a competent job of action and effects, but is clearly just another round of content shot out of the chamber of the Military/Industrial/Entertainment Complex.The plot was suck, but then JJ Abrams has never met a story yet he couldn't ruin. I've got no problem with reboots and reimagining. Fuck, it goes all the way back to Homer, who rebooted the stories of Mycenaeans. But, when you claim it's all new, and then serve up the same stale shit, I got a problem with that. So, the Force Awakens provided nothing new, and I supposed we have to wait for the next installment to see whether this movie actually sucked or not.If the next movie involves Abrams insisting that it is not a reboot of the Empire Strikes Back, then we know this movie sucked.Actually, the Empire Strikes Back is an anomaly, because every other movie in this franchise (provided we ignore New Hope, which was a reboot of Flash Gordon) has sucked a big red rubber dick. Joseph Campbell be damned.In the meantime, I think I'll go see The Big Short, which was what I wanted to see to begin with."},

Mysterious explosions were reported throughout Porter County for the next couple of years. The book actually didn't provide me with a whole lot of information I hadn't already obtained through the local library, but it was still useful.Keep in mind, I'm not bragging, just relating the facts. in retrospect, I was one dumb fucker who should have been maimed or worse.I set up a lot of exploding targets to shoot at throughout the 70s and 80s, but pretty much had gotten jaded and lost interest by 1985. On a personal safety note, we videotaped the explosion of a gallon can of gas attached to target explosive that captured shrapnel whizzing inches by the camera... and my face, and that experience pretty much put an end to that fascination.To anyone who approached me about this form of pyrotechnics today, I'd say\"Make Sure Me And Mine Aren't Around When You Blow Your Stupid Head Off, You Dumb Fucker\"."},

I don't think I want to talk about guns and gun use in America, but rather the PR battle over guns and gun use in America. There is a loose rumor going around the college that perhaps qualified instructors and personnel should be armed. Kind of tells you who is winning the battle. Considering I usually want to shoot someone in the face at least two or three times daily, I think I should perhaps exclude myself from that policy. And I consider myself a reasonably intelligent and steadily mature adult. Maybe I'll get a sword.A couple of politically incorrect assertions:1) Your average American is a tard. They can barely operate their own bodies, let alone anything beyond that. They are actually worse than tards. Consider that, H erectus, a million years ago, with an IQ of perhaps 60, an imbecile, domesticated fire. Do you think the average American can do that? Domesticate fire? I don't. Just for shits and giggles, I would like to perform an annual experiment called National Hammer Day, in which every American qualified to vote must go throughout the day equipped with a hammer, just to see how that goes.2) Your average American is a #guntard, meaning that fewer and fewer Americans know how to use a weapon. (I know #guntard usually means someone who drools over and/or beats off to guns). So, the math would seem to be more guns = more tards with guns, which I would think is not a good thing. Viz: the archetype of Barney Fife, with a bullet in his pocket, and he is Law Enforcement!3) Your average American is as well informed about everything as they are about guns, gun use, gun abuse, tards with guns, the trend of more tards with guns, and the consequences of same, but special interest groups, hoping to manipulate public perceptions, have made it as hard as possible to get good reliable data on this whole topic. Therefore, we are dazzled with bullshit. We are dazzled with bullshit on practically every subject, so this is not a surprise. As a result, the only reliable data, from statistics, is denied your average American, and he or she is forced to rely upon a steady diet of anecdote.4) As a result, PR people are having a field day, but we must also remember that your average PR person is also a tard. Often a very-well-paid tard, which makes me question the existence of a loving personal God.Witness, for example, the popularity of the term #gungrabber. I personally think this is a backfire meme*. The simpleminded idea of #gungrabber is to portray someone who wants to take away your gun. I don't get that impression. I get the impression of gun owners who are portrayed as powerless little infants, babies with candy in their hands. And these mean old gun grabbers just coming up and snatching the gun right out of their soft, weak, pudgy little hands. \"Hey! Gimme back my gun you mean old #gungrabber! Why, if I had gun, I'd show you!\" Gun owners as scared little bunnies with tiny little paws that can barely hold on to a gun, and they are stressed out, forced to worry about #gungrabbers lurking behind bushes going to snatch their little guns away. What a horrible life!#Gungrabber implies bullies, and bullies require victims. So, if gun owners, even with the advantage of holding a gun, are 90-lb weaklings worried about getting sand kicked in their face, that kind of defeats the purpose of the carefully crafted image of gun owners as the only responsible, sober, mature adults in America."},

Doctors are more like engineers. They look for the closest solution to a problem and apply. Oftentimes that solution is a square peg for a round hole, and they force and mutilate the problem to fit the solution. Mathematicians do that too).Not that I consider myself a teacher, at least, not as my primary role, but I do wear that hat a lot. And I think teachers, as healers, see a huge gaping wound in the head at the beginning of life called ignorance, and try to heal it.My primary role as I see it? The archetype known as Uncle Thor, which is to keep the kiddies (ages zero to one hundred) safe. Keep them safe, so they can have fun. So they can play. Because if you can't play, you can't learn.Play involves some strictures, but nothing to actually hobble play. Nothing to retard it. You have to set up edges of the envelop, and then be ready to let the edges be stretched a bit. Play also involves a bit of tailoring to the person. Not everyone is going to appreciate the type or level of play that others thrive on. You can't predict what type of play will make them  thrive, but you can make corrections for when they are hindered. And so, first, do not hinder.That's a very difficult thing to do. And since I'm not a particularly good diagnostician, in that I am self-centered enough not to recognize when people are not having the kind of fun I consider fun. So I do not think of myself as a nurturing teacher, but rather, an uncle who will only occasionally say no.And also, usually, show them how they can get hurt, or into trouble, and that is best done by leading by example.Still, it is very rewarding when, after you've scared them a little to not stray too far outside the playground boundaries, and get them set up, that you can walk away and say: \"You know what to do\"."},

You can't really do much more with stone. Ah, but combine it with braided grasses, sinews, pliable wood, and you get a bow and arrow, which is a game changer - both personally and societal.I don't really know how old bow and arrow tech is, but I'd hazard close to maybe 200,000 years old. That probably contradicts what most anthropologists and archaeologists surmise, which is at least 71,000 years old.Now, would anyone, looking at a hand axe, predict a bow and arrow? Probably somebody, not usually likely.Move on to the laser. When it first came out, predictions were for burning and cutting, death rays maybe, and that's about it.

And we I have not the slightest clue as to where it will go.Already, some silly proposals have been made as to what to do with it. One silly scientist suggests it will be used to prolong human life. What a useless thing to do. You might as well breed for blond hair and blue eyes, to create psychopathic super soldiers.Already, limitations have been shown to exist in the technology. A recent Chinese effort to genetically modify human embryos ran into some serious obstacles. But, the tech always improves.Still, if are worried about homo superior, or some horrible pandemic, relax for a bit. We do know that people are concerned enough about the tech they recently had an ethics symposium. And at this ethics symposium use of CRISPR was given a green light.Sensible. As far as I know, no technology has ever been suppressed, has never been stopped. Even prohibited tech has been pursued clandestinely, so why not pursue it out in the open? It's going to happen anyway, so the best option is to set up protocols. Worried? Scared? Good! That is sensible too. But don't worry overmuch. Our doomsdays are not coming from the future. Our doomsdays are already here, jostling and competing to be made manifest.Have a good weekend!"},

{"title": "For Your Consideration", "date": "Wednesday, December 2, 2015", "text": "The afternoon of July 1st, 1863, General Ulysses S. Grant sat sweltering in the parlor of a farmhouse outside of Vicksburg, trying to determine when would be an appropriate time to start drinking. Dinner would not be served for a few more hours, and he not did prefer to sober up again for the night. He eyed the bottle on his writing desk, then turned to work on the daily reports. He closed his eyes, ground palms to sockets to concentrate a moment.A silvery lightning flash penetrated Grant's hands and eyelids, with no corresponding crash of thunder. Grant started in his seat, blinked his eyes to relieve the dazzle of the purple retinal afterglow. This dazzle was no treelike pattern of lightning, but rather more an animal's claw drawn raggedly across the backs of his eyes.A brief, jagged rip had opened in the space-time continuum, and out from the Shining Void stepped Dr. Miguelito Quixote Loveless and his retinue.\"Greetings, Mr. President!\" said Dr. Loveless cheerfully, \"And how goes the Siege of Vicksburg on this... dismally muggy and oppressive day?\"Grant blinked and peered about the parlor before discerning the dwarfish form of Dr. Loveless. Loveless was impeccably attired in a silk morning coat, silk hat, and gold tipped cane. He wore an enormous green cravat that made his pink face look like a grotesque flower. Behind Loveless hulked his assistant, the giant Voltaire. Voltaire clutched a large metal barrel. Next to the giant stood the lovely Antoinette, who held a wicker basket.\"...tolerably well, I should say, sir\", Grant hazarded.\"Ah! I admired your aplomb and composure! It is true what they say of your complete sangfroid in unusual situations. My hat is off to you, sir!\" Dr. Loveless tipped his hat and placed it upon Grant's desk.\"Allow me to introduce myself! I am Doctor Miguelito Quixote Loveless! These are my companions, Miss Antoinette, and Mr. Voltaire! We are all of us time travelers, having come from your far future!\"\"How do you do?\" replied Grant. He held up a hand towards Loveless and pointed towards the basket. \"Is that for me?\" he asked.The doctor, interrupted in his prepared speech, somewhat disconcerted, nodded. \"Actually, yes. A token of our esteem, a gift basket for you, containing- \"\"a bottle of Old Crow Bourbon, apples, oranges, some pieces of fried chicken, fresh bread and butter, and a brace of quite excellent Havana cigars\".The crooked smile vanished from Loveless' face. \"How did you...?\"\"...know the contents? Well, Doctor, this is not the first time you've appeared before me\", said Grant.Loveless's eyebrows shot up, visibly taken aback, literally rocked on his heals.\"May I please, dear? The basket?\" Grant asked Antoinette. She looked at Loveless, who pale and stiff, nodded permission. As she placed the basket upon the table, Grant looked up at Voltaire. \"Please, sir, put that heavy thing down and be at ease\".Voltaire humped the barrel to the floor with a grunt. Doctor Loveless, his handsome face suddenly becoming pale and stiff with anger, demanded \"What do you mean not the first time? We have just now travelled here to this time and place!\"\"Come, come sir!\" cajoled Grant, \"Do you not know the first thing about time travel? By appearing in the past, you have created a time loop. I have, by my count, gone through this encounter perhaps a few hundred times. Fortunately, the loop is recursive, and so is never the way same twice, else I - and the rest of the universe - would be quite insane. But to you, it will always be the first time\".\"Impossible! I...\" Loveless's voice trailed off as he started to think about this situation.Grant unfolded  the calico cover of the basket, removed the bottle of Old Crow, uncorked it, plucked out a cigar, held it under his nose and sniffed. \"Wonderful \" he sighed, \"and the fact that I die from throat cancer does not deter me in the least from smoking one. Sir, do you indulge?\"\"Loveless paced the floor and shook his head, \"Yes, but not now, thank you. I must appraise this new information\".\"Well, let tell you what you planned, and what things occurred the first time you visited\". Loveless stopped his pacing. \"Please do\" he replied.\"You and your plucky companions arrived from Hollywood California, circa 1964-\".\"Aha! Nonsense!\" interjected Loveless. \"We arrived from New Haven, Connecticut 1872! I completed the time machine that year!\"\"So it would seem to you\", countered Grant \"As I said, this-\" he gestured around him \"this is a recursive time loop you've stuck the Universe in. Or rather, if you will, a Do loop, an iterated algorithm where the result of the computation is fed back into the formula and repeated. So, it would seem to you, at the start point, that you arrived from Yale University, where you were a professor of the physical sciences, with the means and resources to assemble the material and device that you call a time machine. And at the same time, constructed the nuclear device which Mr. Voltaire has placed upon the floor. You offered to end the Siege of Vicksburg for me, with, as you said 'an aerial mine with the power of a million kegs of gunpowder'. All you needed from me was my signature. I, foolishly, accepted your offer, thinking the siege would continue for several months. The blast not only wiped out Vicksburg, it irradiated and incapacitated nearly a third of my army. It did end the siege, and the war, once news spread of a horrible weapon possessed by the Union. You then travelled forward in time, produced a land grant with my now Presidential signature transferring much of the state of California into your possession, but in turn, meaning you never took the position at Yale, and thus never created the time machine, which created a paradoxical loop in time.\"\"This is utter nonsense!\" laughed Loveless, \" a fabrication!\"\"Perhaps, as I said, that was the first iteration\". But you obviously need more convincing. You and I have spent a great deal of time as adversaries, Doctor, and I know a great about you. Grant proceeded to tell Loveless his whole life, the family history. How the strange experiments of Herr Doktor Lieblos, Miguelito's father, had inadvertently resulted in his dwarfism. How the Liebloses of Austria had been exiled. How they emigrated to America, how the Viceroy of New Spain granted the family large tracts of the province of Alta California. How the land was stolen by the Republic of California. And on and on until finally Loveless, dark browed and stiff lipped, admitted this all might be true.\"Fine,\" Loveless acceded. \"Now what?\"\"Why, you accept President Lincoln's exchange offer for the city of Los Angeles and its surrounds, and then go back to Yale to avoid the paradox\".\"Exchange? For what price?\"\"We'll give it to you for a song\"."},
{"title": "This Old Horse", "date": "Monday, November 23, 2015", "text": "\"How was your bronze pour Saturday?\" I was asked this morning.\"I had so much fun!\" I replied, \"It was just one problem after another!\" That was not sarcasm. I really did have a lot of fun solving problems.The reason, of course, that it was so much fun was because I adapted, improvised, overcame.  Not to brag, but I was the horse that knew the way to carry the sleigh. Actually, you know what? I'm gonna brag.I was a fucking stud Saturday. I was big swinging-dick stallion Saturday. Was? Am!Horse or jackass? You decide.First off, we had that big snowstorm, which got us off to a late start. We were forecast to get eight to twelve inches of heart attack snow Friday night and Saturday. I lost maybe ten minutes of sleep worrying about that. Got up to pee at 3am, looked out the window, saw that the snow was not sticking to the roads and said, \"Okay no problems\".We were scheduled to start at 9am, and some people didn't make until 11am, but I got us going around 10. I had people calling all morning asking if the bronze pour was still on, and I said yeah get your ass in here!Pantomime Horse Testicles... I guessA video crew hired by marketing arm of Continuing Education came in to film us and do interviews. I had them interview my students and me while the first heat was getting up to temperature. I was fed questions, but still was very conscious of trying not to be a dork.I know some people are very suave and polished in front of a camera, and I do well in public speaking situations, but there is something about cameras and tape recorders that gets me tangled up in my thoughts and all stumbly in presentation. Hopefully, that comes across as charming as opposed to dorky, and I'll find out in a month when they post the video on the Harper website.So, and then our lance pyrometer (the digital device you stick in the molten metal to gauge the temperature) decided to crap out. I announced to the class that we were going Old Skool and I would pour based upon the color of the metal. (You really can't tell what temperature it is with any degree of accuracy what the metal temperature is, but you want to see yellow-white hot color). What that meant is if I had to squint to look at the metal, it was probably ready. What that meant in actuality was we were going to pour the molds way too hot, and there was a good chance of a lot of gas porosity defects in the pieces.Gift from a student I found this morningLastly, there were a few spills taking crucibles out of one furnace, and the spilled metal caused the base block to float. And thus the crucible kept leaning over and resting on the side of the furnace. The first time I saw it I said what the fuck some dumbass student didn't put the crucible back correctly, and I repositioned it. The next time, and it is leaning over again, I look down at the bottom of the furnace and notice a beautiful sea of quicksilver down there, with the base block and crucible kind of swimming around in it.Well, this will not do, so when they go to pour that heat, I grab a scoop, go in and scoop out the bottom, slap it up against a wall, go in for another four or five times to get the level of the spilled metal down. My leather welding glove caught fire, and people are jostling me to notice that my hand is on fire, and I'm getting with them saying \"I know! I know! Get the fuck away from me!\". Finally get that done and heave the flaming glove off my hand before I'm burned.So, that's taken care of. And then the rest of the day was just the normal broken molds or spilled metal through cracks in molds. We got a 100% survival rate.In retrospect, I'm kind of amazed at my own somatic behavior when it comes to all this. If a mold cracked, people would freak and stop pouring and I would yell at them to continue, and just jam a scoop of sand up against the leak, and do it without even thinking about it. It's all a reflex action now.And, as stumbly and dorky as I usually am (despite being pretty athletic all told), and as skittish a group of colts I had working the pour, I was beautiful and flaming dance we did. Seriously, I was fucking graceful. It's just all muscle memory now. It really, thinking about it, is amazing how no thought, zero thought, was involved in my movements and decision making. It just happened, and it was a beautiful thing."},
{"title": "Active Shooter Situation", "date": "Thursday, November 19, 2015", "text": "We've a terrorist drill at the college today. I had to take a DHS class in preparation for this, which, as you might expect, was a circle jerk. I got a certificate of completion for that.I have a little card in my wallet now, that says \"Run Hide Fight\". It explains what to do in an active shooter situation. The drill isn't really real because everyone knows it is going to happen. I have thought about what to do, since it is all situational, I'm going to do things which I would not have done prior to taking the class, so I suppose it wasn't a complete waste of time.For example, I've designated our kiln room as sanctuary because it is spacious, there are two exits, and both doors lock automatically when closed. I'm also going to close and lock the tool cage in the woodshop because that has things that can jimmy doors open. Before I lock the tool cage, I grab a nice big crowbar and direct the students to grab all the hammers and heavy throwables.As you can guess, I find the Run and Hide part distasteful, and contrary to my barbarian nature. I suppose, in some type of horseshit macho fantasy scenario that so many psychotic Americans run through, I will be fierce and victorious. And armed. But that's all horseshit, and anyone with a frontal lobe can see that.But I amended the DHS plan to Hide (and be ready to Fight), Run (and be ready to Fight) Fight (and have something to Fight with).But I have stepped up to the plate in real life. I think most people will. Not any kind of heroic scenario, mind you, but what is a hero anyway? Hero through Latin, front the Greek heros, protector. Well, that says to me, someone that can take care of themselves as well as someone else. Notice I said \"can take care of themselves\" first.Self-sacrifice? Fuck that. I can't protect you if I'm out of the picture. Like swimmers that abandon drowners that try to drown them, a certain amount of selfishness is involved in this. Not surprising. It's never cut and dried.Anyway, the drill is about to start, and I've got people to protect, even if it is just practice."},

People I know there were happy because they were selling.The unconscious theme this year was creepy baby dolls and baby doll heads, which is to say, Death. For the longest time in the western word, at least prior to the now 100-year-old anomaly, the thing that babies did most of all was to die. You had to make a lot of babies to get just a few to breeding age. Not surprising, then, that, like clowns, babies are associated with Death. I took very few pictures of the baby doll sculptures. Didn't see a need to. And, of course, no pictures of glass, which is the usual same ol' same ol' with SOFA. Not enough wood, ceramics, metal, textiles. Way too much fucking glass.Thomas R Riley galleries had some nice stuff, including several pieces by my friend Philip Soosloff.Here is a nice wood sculpture, a collaboration between Graeme Priddle and Melissa Engler called Incubus Triptych:I forget the gallery, but I liked this piece by Andrew Hayes of book paper folded around and encased by steel.This wood piece, titled \"Rural Route 1\" was by Randy Reid.At first I like this cast glass and found steel piece by Paul J. Nelson, but now I'm not so crazy about it.Svenja John of Germany made these fun little objects out of polycarbonate foil.I've always like mosaics. Jun Kaneko had two big heads with mosaics.

I liked these two paintings by Bill Sala, entitled \"Bindlestiff\", and \"A Fool And His Money\".Susan Saladino did some fun clay pieces that looked like paper mache. This is the only glass I took a picture of. Blown glass Spray paint cans.I took this picture, which did not turn out so well, as one of the clay students is interested in crystalline glazes. This glaze is called Sea Foam Green. The piece is entitled \"Bottle\" by Hideaki Miyamura.Abmeyer + Wood had a lot of good clay. They showed some fun semi-creepy baby doll sculptures by ceramics artist Calvin Ma, entitled \"Softie\" and \"Reaching\". Patti Warashina is an established ceramics artist.

{"title": "Weapons Fashion Design", "date": "Tuesday, November 3, 2015", "text": "Eldest Bro sent me two links.The first link was to Philip K Dick's novel The Zap Gun. The book is a mess, probably because Phil wrote in 1967, when there was some really good illicit street drugs out there. The salient point to be taken was that weapons had become fashion items to be plowshared into civilian consumer products. The weapons themselves were basically useless, but looked really cool.The second link was to a promotional video of Boeing's \"new\" F-15SE Silent Eagle. Please note the Project Runway music begins at about 57 seconds in. It's all twirking teenage cornhole stuff after that. Lots of nice little Barbie accessory items that you simply must have from then on.This is not the ornamentation of weaponry, which has gone on for at least 200,000 years. This is not the \"making special of\" crafting that you can see on everything from hand axes through to jeweled swords and pear-handled guns. Nor is this an offshoot of the toy industry. Toys, of course, actually are useful, in that they used for play, which is a worthwhile learning activity.No, this is the fetishization of weapons into a utterly useless seasonal statement. This is, if you will, the equivalent of fiat currency in a weapon form of approved personal adornment. This is making a useful item useless, rolling into the mass production and consumption treadmill that capitalism's very existence depends upon.Other clues: Hummers. As a military vehicle, hummers basically suck. Trucks, on the other hand, are very useful military vehicles. I see hummers all over the road with tiny little people inside. I really want to give civilian hummer drivers the full Hummer experience with a well-place improvised explosive device.Mp5 lookalike. Hey, a lot of weapons are not so good. Not so well designed. Others, like the AK-47, or the AR-15, are pretty nice.But the GSG-5 22 LR Tactical MP5 Lookalike? Looks cool, and if the only thing you want to do is shoot squirrels, why this is gun for you. But something more useful? How about the new AK-12?It's a fashion statement!Body armor. First of all, body armor is great for protecting the trunk, but do you really want to go through life brain-damaged and missing your genitals? And how many civilians (or Ferguson police) really needs this fucking shit? I mean, outside people that are going to go on shooting sprees? Drones. How about this fun little item? Priora Robotics sold the Army a drone that is outperformed by civilian hobby drones.Get used to this, folks."},

Ham. Ham is great. Chili cheese dogs. Bacon. Actually, I can take or leave bacon. It's OK, but I don't go nuts over it the way some people do. I'm told that even vegans lust for bacon. So maybe there is something wrong with me.So, am I worried about cancer from eating processed meats? No fuck that.I've been living on maybe 40% fat intake - and unwittingly developed the metabolism to burn it - for 58 years. You should see pictures of me as an infant, morbidly obese fat little baby being held by adults smoking cigarettes. I mean, a tiger would have loved to eat me back then. A pack of hyenas would have been in fat baby heaven had I been air dropped onto the savanna. But I slimmed down fast and yet still ate every fatty thing known to humankind. Fat? For me? Is not a problem.I'm gonna grill me some ham and eggs in a ton of butter. Better still, a Denver omelet with onions and green peppers and a little paprika on top, fried up in a ton of butter. Oh man, I'm getting hungry.No, I'm trying to cut back on the starches and sugars. That's a problem for me. Let me talk a little bit more about pig. Pig gets a bad rap.You might remember during the drought of 2012 pig farmers were forced to feed their animals gummy bears and stale halloween candy and such, because their regular fodder (not much better) was in short supply? And I had some of that pig, and it was not good. Kind of slimy. Kind of... I don't know, nebulously unhealthy.I have some friends who had their daughters in 4H, and they would raise all sorts of animals, but they really liked pigs. (Almost invariably two cute pigs, named Lunch and Dinner, so they knew what pigs were about). So, they'd slaughter the pigs and have a pig roast, and store the rest of meat in the freezer. And this was just fantastic pork, and I'll you why. They had a forest on their property, and the pigs would forage in the forest. Acorn-and-walnut-fed pig is something you have to experience.So, that's not my problem. My problem is I have a sweet tooth you would not believe, and as part of the health kick I am on, I am cutting back on starches and sugars.Halloween! Son of a bitch! Halloween!Shit, man, I'm gonna have to postpone healthy living..."},
{"title": "Upper Class Twit Crashes Bank, Pinks Science", "date": "Monday, October 26, 2015", "text": "I've said before that if I need to know what stupid people think, I read the Wall Street Journal editorial page. It's almost as good as Investor's Business Daily at determining what stupid people think.And generally, if I want to know what incredibly stupid people think, I'll read the comments following the editorial. But on this particular editorial, the comments are actually not all that stupid!So, the retarded* old custard pot that wrote this ridiculous and risible piece of business fluffing is named Matt Ridley, and he literally is an upper class twit. Matt, by the way, crashed a bank in 2007. Per Wikipedia:\"In September 2007 Northern Rock became the first British bank since 1878 to suffer a run on its finances at the start of the credit crunch. It was forced to apply to the Bank of England for emergency liquidity funding, following problems caused by the financial crisis of 2007–08.[34] The failure of the bank eventually led to the nationalisation of Northern Rock. Ridley went before a parliamentary committee which criticised him for not recognising the risks of the bank's financial strategy and thereby \"harming the reputation of the British banking industry.\"[11] He resigned as chairman in October 2007.[11]\"In order to make his case against government funding of basic science, or perhaps ANY funding of basic science, Matt seems to be mangling the message of Kevin Kelly's technium book, What Technology Wants. Matt seems to make the case that somehow technology has disconnected from human brains, hands, and hearts, and is churning along all on its own making its own stuff.  I suppose I could parody his contention and suggests that we just set up a room for technology where it can reproduce in peace. But the idea (similar I suppose to Dawkin's hopelessly not-even-wrong bullshit meme idea, that the real replicators are ideas and concepts that breed like parasites in our empty animal brains) that technology has taken on a life of its own and really doesn't need us is something that an eight-year-old might buy into, but hopefully a regular adult sees as pretty fucking stupid. But continuing Matt's argument It seems that if technology doesn't need individuals, well then, collectives of individuals are not only unnecessary, but actually an impediment. Standard libertarian horseshit.I have to assume that some private enterprise libertards needed a little brony swoon, and Matt obliged them.The fact that Matt directs the narrative through cherry picking and some outright lies doesn't help his argument, but then, the WSJ editorial has never ever worried about reality."},

Yeah, those days are gone... maybe.It is now seven weeks and five days on since my nephrectomy. At my four week checkup, the doctors said \"Wait six weeks before you start running again, and maybe slowly ramp up to your regular workouts\". Well, at the six week checkup, the doctors were delighted at how my wounds had healed (told you I was a werewolf), but there was no way I was ready to do my regular workouts again.I have to say that that nice big spiral cut honey baked ham slice they'd taken out of my internal lower left quadrant still felt like a ham slice. A friend of mine in the medical field told me \"Dude, don't kid yourself about the minimal invasive procedure with the laproscopy, they did major carpentry work inside you. I've seen the procedure and it's pretty brutal\". Yeah, and that's how it felt: like they had beat the living shit out of me, just kicked me in the nads over and over.The doctor himself admitted as much. \"We moved a lot of stuff around. You did have a football-sized dead kidney in there. It was occupying half your abdomen\".(You may want to skip this paragraph as it contains intimate personal details). It's true, the swolled up bag of piss did a major constriction on my sigmoid colon and other organs down there. I was pooping out either watery stuff or strings of spaghetti at random pretty much every waking hour of the day towards the end there. And now? Friggin' Burmese pythons coming out of my hind end. Good solid, regular bowel movements. Oh yeah!A student of mine who is into street fighting martial arts* gave me another clue about what happened. He confirmed that the kick-in-the-nads feeling can happen from a kidney punch or flat heeled kick to the kidney, what with the neural wiring in there. \"But don't get the wrong idea, it's not so much the nerves per se as it is the neuromyofascial connections that have been upset.\"Right, all the connective tissue, it's been abused and shoved around, and that portion of my extracellular matrix that contains my organs and surrounds my belly took a nasty beating.  More on all this in a minute.So, I tried working out last week. I did 50% of my normal workout, substituting vigorous turn on an elliptical machine for my running. But I did core workouts no problem. Medicine ball, free weights, pull ups, etc. with no problem and no guts shooting out all over the floor. I was sore - as expected - for three days, but then went back at it, and ramped it up to 90%. Threw in a kettle bell workout, kip rope, and the usual postural stretch routines, and it all felt pretty good. So there's that.Thing is, I am re-evaluating how I am going to stay in shape in the future, and for awhile flirted with the idea of taking a parkour class. Someone suggested I hold off on that.But here's the interesting thing. Through the usual serendipitous synchroncity that informs my readings and interactions, I've been exploring various aspects of the Natural Movement exercises. So, someone mentions Feldenkrais, and I say, isn't that funny that's about the third time people have talked about it in as many months. Then, I'm talking to martial arts guy, and he's going on and on about connective tissue, and I'm like, huh, I'm hearing about this too. And then, I get a book from the library by Chris McDougall (author of Born to Run), and about halfway in to this book Natural Born Heroes, and he starts talking about fascia.So, I'm like, oh, okay, well when enough people tell you don't look so hot, maybe you are sick.So, I'm researching an organized routine for that. I'm still gonna run, because that's what I do, and still gonna lift weights, because that's also what I do, but now I'm going to work on becoming an animal, because it would nice to be Tarzan again after that year of... nothing."},

It's mature star that is surrounded by a young disk of rubble. There are all sorts of proposed methods for this to occur naturally, but it could be ET.

That includes art produced some 500,000 years ago, by Homo erectus.Is there earlier art? How about bower birds, who have been making art for 50 million years?How about language? Slavery? Domestication of animals? War? Ants did all that and more 90 million years ago.I know ants had war, and, unlike humans, who send their young men, ants send their old ladies. But bees have war? I know bees will raid other nests for honey. But bees have wars. Certain kinds of bees. Stingless bees.Well, why war? The usual explanation is resource scarcity. Bees need honey or pollen, or a good hive, and if the rewards outweigh the costs, why not? I think you have to throw in euscociality as well.In which  case, I would argue humans are eusocial. We have cooperative brood care, we have overlapping generations within a hive, we have a division of labor. We are a heck of a lot more cooperative and in-group friendly than our nearest relatives, the chimps.What about termites? They go back a good 200 million years.  Do they have war? They do not. Not war between termites. And why should they? Wood, dung, detritus, all are in plenty abundance. There is no resource scarcity. And yet termites have soldiers.

So, and if you don't have a magnetic field? The next best thing would be dirt. On the Moon, a good two meters of lunar regolith cuts down on 99% of solar and cosmic radiation. Same for Mars. If you want to remain an ape-shaped denizen of Outer Space, you gotta be prepared to become a moleman. Which, guess what, still makes life in space a sucky experience.That dirt comes in handy down here. Many did not appreciate digging in during the Civil War, or later during World War I, but it sure helped when it came to stopping bombs and artillery shells.The use of concrete in WWII resulted in some (mainly Nazi) structures so indestructible that they remain in place as uneconomical or even infeasible to tear down.Even during the Korean War, there was a stalemate that produced an old-fashioned trench warfare segment.\"We hated to dig,\" recalled A. Robert Abboud, First Marine Division Company commander at Outpost Bunker Hill. \"The Chinese were wonderful diggers. They had tunnels they could drive trucks through. We couldn't get to them with our air power because they were underground all the time\".Fast forward to the Vietnam War, and it wasn't just tunnels and warrens that stymied air power, the jungle cover itself was quite sufficient.\"the Jason* scientists calculated that use of tactical nuclear weapons to destroy the Ho Chi Minh trail would require at least ten a day, or 3,000 per year. The amount of downed trees would actually increase the cover provided to the enemy. The best alternative would be to seed choke points of the trail with highly radioactive waste, but radioactivity decays, and the window of impassibility would close. Besides, there was no reason the enemy could not forge new trails\".As long as we steer clear of H-bombs (for which dirt is not so effective) it would appear dirt solves a lot of problems when it comes to countering offensive systems, whether human operated air power, or increasingly, autonomous unmanned air power.Which kind of gets me to the current worry over artificial intelligence, and the coming prospect of autonomous hunter/killer robots. The likes Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates worry that this creates a doomsday scenario.Oh, ho hum. Competing doomsdays are all around us. And they don't come from the future, they blossom from the past.It's pretty evident that our own aggregate artificial intelligences have a rather ironic habit of producing incredibly primitive behaviors, despite our best minds strategizing outcomes. Look no further than the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, rarely rising above the invertebrate behavior of fiddler crabs on the beach. So, it doesn't take much intelligence to get extinction going.But those HKs... don't even have to be that smart. Dragonflies are very effective killing machines. So, we don't even have to get to human level intelligence. And HKs are inevitable, even without the influence of the arms industry, which is considerable.DARPA is heavily influenced by the Defense Science Board. Where DARPA goes, the Pentagon follows. And the Defense Science Board is is stacked with people who serve on the boards of corporations that manufacture robotic systems for DARPA and the Pentagon. Corporations and organizations like Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Bechtel, Aerospace Corporation, Texas Instruments, IBM, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, Sandia National Laboratories, etc. etc. not even counting the small fry.And all of these guys have a major hardon for autonomous hunter/killer robots. And not just robots. Robot systems. And not just robots systems, but systems of systems. Systems of systems on land, sea, air and outer space, like wheels within wheels within wheels.Worried about the Chinese building air strip castles in the South China Sea? Worried about those hypersonic anti-ship missiles? Pheh! Too little, too late. So solly, Charlie. The US of A nimbly outmaneuvered and outspent the Chinese some twenty years ago.Castles? Walls? Sorry guys. That arms race is done. Finito.Dirt? Maybe if you got enough of it, if you dig down deep enough and clever enough, might help you out, but nowadays, it is no longer the cheap solution it once was."},

People fuck up, and as such, organizations are prone to error.Why, even hot shot organizations filled with the best of the best of the best can fuck up. So that NASAs can crash robot satellites into Mars because one team calculated in centimeters and another in inches. SRI International gave us Uri Geller. DARPA seems to have been snookered by \"hearts and minds\" sociologists promising to find out what makes, first the Viet Cong in Vietnam, and then, later Sunni insurgents in Iraq, tick.What makes the Viet Cong tick?That's a great question. It was asked by Ivy League egghead Robert Macnamara. (A similar, amnesiac's, question was later asked by the wretched Donald Rumsfeld, in the form of \"What's with all these IEDs? Don't they realize we stole their country fair and square\"!!?).Actually, if you were working outside of the Defense Department in, say, 1964, that would be an easy question to answer. But, if you were working in the Defense department, and didn't like the easy answer (The Viet Cong tick because Yankee No Go Home), that was a very hard question to answer. It required reams of papers from extensive studies, and millions of dollars, and lots of self-deception, to get to the hard answer. And the hard answer was \"This pesky Southeast Asian war will be over in a year. Maybe two. If we can just get the gooks to get with the program\".So, I think I've mentioned before that I have a theory, or rather an entertainment (since theory and theater share the same root word), that, from 1945 onward, the world experienced a prolonged WWIII over a fifty year period. We exploded a little more than half a gigaton in nuclear weapons tests into the atmosphere, dirtying up our air, soil, and water.And the entertainment is that, as result, all that radiation affecting the brain development of human fetuses, anyone born after, say, 1954, is severely and profoundly retarded. And so, our parents, and older brothers and sisters, have worked feverishly to reverse the genetic damage, and when that was found to be irreversible, to work feverishly to created a Fisher-Price civilization to accommodate all of us retards.I told this fantasy at a family gathering once, and got a laugh out of everyone except my parents. And they gave me the fish eye, and maybe even looked at each other and thought \"What do you know, he's on to us\".But that's not what I want to talk about, save that puts us on the subject of post-apocalyptic armageddonal thinking. So, Biopreparat, and Ken Alibek. Were we snookered by the Soviets?I think partly. I have no doubt that Soviet Union developed some of the most horrifying and hideous bioweapons during the Cold War. I think Ken Alibek was more or less truthful in describing the program. Oh, sure, I'm sure there was some exaggeration, a little added coloration and flair for the telling. And why not? Because, you know, money to be made.But yeah, chimeric superbugs and viruses loaded into cozy little room-tempature capsules, mounted SS-18 Satan missiles, to be dropped along with all the horrors of war on American cities? Sure, why not?Gotta trust the Russkies not to pull any punches. Honestly, I'd be disappointed otherwise.But it got me to thinking. Isn't that kind of a overly crude stratagem for chess players? I mean, downright Neolithic? Just straight out brute force in a brute force projection arms race escalation is a waste of a game. Not when the arms race of deceit and fraud is so much more interesting.Consider: there are many instances of viruses infecting hosts and then doing nothing. They are called stealth viruses, and their DNA package is a called a silent load. So, for example, E coli bacteria can be infected with a virus, and then it just sits there. Then, some type of environmental trigger, for example and application of antibiotics, causes the virus to wake up and replicate. This has actually happened in some human patients where, receiving an antibiotic to clear up a nasty bacterial infection, suddenly come down with an even more serious viral infection. Creepy!So, and there are instances that we know of now where, through the application of light, epigenetic or genetic changes can be triggered, and this is called optogenetics.So, it so happens that one of the vaccines used in the anti-polio vaccination programs of the 1950s and '60s used cultures of kidney cells from African green monkeys. These cells, discovered later, contained monkey virus, simian virus 40, SV40, which eluded the quality control programs of the day.This is a stretch, but let's assume Soviet scientists knew of optogenetics in the late 40s, and that further, they were able to produce a SV40 chimeric virus using, oh, I don't know, a common viral medium of the time like monkey kidney cells. And this SV40 chimera was set up to be activated by light, and let's say it is light produced by a cathode ray tube. And let's say that one consequence of the activation is the rendering of certain proteins within the brain to produce a thought-smothering plaque choking off the neurons.So, 98 million TV watching Americans over time getting all Alzheimered out, producing a ball and chain drag upon the American economy.Better buy me some Dr. Ken's broad-spectrum immune booster pills."},

I've played with Google Sketchup as well. Tinkercad is super easy to use and I skipped ahead several lessons during the class to get to the good stuff. Didn't really make anything I wanted to print off. And, in fact, not really sure at this stage what I would use for, except maybe as an offering for my students.Obviously, the plastic pieces could be Old Skooled into molds for waxes, with the digital file as the master. It's nice to mix old and new, even nicer to get old stuff to do new stuff.The librarian teacher said the plastic was actually polylactic acid, which is meltable and burnable. I said I do metal casting at Harper College, give me a piece and I'll cast it in metal and you can show it off in future classes.He gave me a knight chess piece. So, I invested it in a jewelry flask, burned it out and spin cast in bronze. Nothing at all new there. Shapeways does this all the time.So, I treated it like lost wax with same burnout schedule. Heat to 400F, hold for two hours, heat to 1350F to burn out carbon, hold for 1 hour, cool to 900F and cast. The librarian told me the piece took two hours to print. I probably could have carved it in an hour. Total time from plastic to metal was 1 day (overnight).Here it is:Here is a close-up of the piece. Got a nice laminar look to it. You can see the \"granularity\" or resolution is about .2 mm.Could have done a better job of spruing so it didn't have defects, but what the hey, it's rapid prototyping.

{"title": "The Infernal Machine", "date": "Wednesday, September 23, 2015", "text": "I'm going to give you two maxims, perhaps three. The first is from someone you've never heard of, the second is not strictly a maxim, more of a quote, but can be treated as a 'short, pithy statement expressing a general truth or rule of conduct'. So, then, the first:\"No subsequent amount of steps will fix a fucked-up first step\" - Newman's Maximand the second?\"Do it right the first time? NOTHING is done right the first time!\" - God AlmightyThe third one? We may or may not get to that.The one thing right off the bat we should do is envision the Almighty as an American God. As such, He was a bit of a old-fashioned country gentleman, but also not above being a tinkerer or low mechanick (and so not quite a true gentleman), with a charming touch of slight bumbler mixed in, and perhaps a dash of an humbug as well, along the lines of an old Kansas carny huckster.The Almighty, of course, didn't look like any of these things. He was quite an imposing figure when he wanted to be. But, puttering around in the workshop of his weathered old shed seated in tall weeds out back of His estate, dressed up in sweaty coveralls, with occasionally some axle grease smeared on his forehead, or perhaps some residue of magic flash powder covering his face, his eyes out starting from a surprised raccoon bandit mask, He looked less the Almighty and more of a, well, a mad scientist, I suppose.His Host of field angels, slaving happily in the eternal sunshine, rows and rows of verdant and plentiful ambrosia and manna to be picked, often wondered why He spent so much time in the shack out back. His house angels knew better as to the reason why: the Almighty was laboring mightily on getting all of Creation going. He'd had rather a hard time of it, an infinite time in fact, as evidenced by the endless remnants and discards of previous attempts that lay exposed in the unkempt yard around the shack, some overgrown by weeds, others just barely starting to be covered, but all of them never quite the same or up to snuff.And at the end of each Day, He would retire to His palatial mansion, cleaned up and dressed in sparkling white evening attire, enjoy an ice cold glass of Nectar served by the mistress of His Household (and frequent bedmate), sigh and say \"Gonna lick it tomorrow for sure, Lucifer!\"The Almighty and Lucifer in better times. And yes, they do look like Barbara Stanwyck and George BrentAnd sure enough, one day, working on the Infinity Plus Oneth device, which refused to work, He got it. It first sat there all stardust and base metal, gears, flywheels, pistons, screws and levers and inclined planes, all topped by rotary brass-balled governors that sat motionless like a dumbshit.\"Son of a - \" He muttered in frustration, wishing He had some deity of His own to use for a curse. Scratching His forehead, He did what He always did at this stage, which was to smack it hard with a spanner. Only this time, it started to go. Not only did it start to go, but it didn't stop.He shouted with delight, danced a jig, called for all His Hosts to come see, threw open the doors of shack, and lo! Hosannas of praise went up and the resonated throughout the Heavens. And they proclaimed it the Cosmos and it was good....or maybe...Problem was, of course, He had not the slightest idea why it worked, or for that matter why it started to go in the first place. As such, the Almighty was just a little afraid of it, rather the way Frankenstein was not entirely comfortable with his monster.He allowed Himself the conceit that somehow, via His chimpanzee bash with the spanner, He had provided a Divine Spark but that made the darn thing go, but there was always a small quantity of doubt in the back of His mind about the thing. And so He was always a bit careful around it, both because it was rickety cobbled together patchwork kind of a thing, but also because it seemed to possess a life of its own, and do things He didn't expect. (Worrisome when you consider He was omniscient).He had had the presence of mind to installed a viewing tube on the thing, so that He could peer inside to view the workings. This was almost invariably a source of horror and delight to Him, and the complications and permutations and combinations of all the little whizzing parts were of endless fascination. He would wax poetically for hours over dinner, and well into the night, about what He saw in the Cosmos.And then one day Lucifer asked if she could look into the wonder of the Cosmos. The Almighty  wasn't sure that was such a good idea, and said as much. She pleaded and cajoled with such charm and grace that finally He relented. And so, she stepped up to the Cosmos, fixed her lovely eye upon the viewing tube, and exclaimed with delight.And that's when the machinery made a snatch at her.In a twinkling, she was gone, whirled in and swept up into the innards of the Cosmos. The Almighty cried in horror and dismay, tried to find the Off switch, but there was none. Quickly, He searched the innards through the view tube for signs of her. Indications were she whole and intact, but strangely made nonlocal throughout the interior of the Cosmos and, so it would seem, permanently entangled within.Try as He could, He could not extract her from the Cosmos. (Equally worrisome as He was omnipotent).He closed up the shed, locked the latch, and never went back there again."},

{"title": "The Vital Question: A Book Report", "date": "Monday, September 21, 2015", "text": "Nick Lane's The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life is not a book. It is an argument. It is an argument the way Charles Darwin's Origin of the Species is an argument. Nick Lane warns us in his forward, and some may not be ready to slog through this book.Not that the book is that much of a slog, it's actually fairly well written and engaging, and he managed to mostly convince me with his arguments. He does keep the energy calculations to a minimum, but he is going to beat you about the head and shoulders with both data and supposition. So be forewarned.Nick Bostrom, the Doomsday philosopher, will be pleased with this book. Bostrom really, really hopes that extraterrestrial intelligence (and by backwards inference, extraterrestrial life) is not found in the Universe. More locally, Bostrom hopes that absolutely no life is found on Mars, or Ganymede, or Europa, or Enceladas, or anywhere else in the Solar System. And never was.If life is not found, then it is probable that the Great Filter which apparently exists to wipe out Life, is in our past. In other words, given the Fermi Paradox, that the universe seems set up to produce our kind of life, and that once it gets going our kind of life probably is set up to produce intelligent life, then we should be up to our armpits in aliens. We are not. \"Where are they?\" asked Fermi.\"Dead!\" says Bostrom, \"or even better still, Never Made It As Far As Us!\"So, Nick Lane makes a good case for No Complex Life. And by No Complex Life, he really means, no multicellular life, which in turn means no eukaryotic life, but maybe, probably, our kind Life elsewhere in the universe. Just not complex life.Lots and lots of planets - once you eliminate the promising but barren earth like extrasolar candidates of which there are probably a shitload - probably have bacteria on them, and that's it. Bacteria, and archaea, forever and ever, amen.(My own guess, and since we have a sample space of one to go from, is that there are perhaps only 1 out of 1027 worlds like Earth within the particle horizon of the Universe, meaning there is exactly one Earthlike planet that we can observe. That might placate Bostrom, but I doubt it. I know it bums out scifi fans hoping for aliens, but, hey, kids gotta grow up sometime).Lane has done a very good job of convincing me that Earth life  - cellular life - got it's start in alkaline hydrothermal vents at the bottom of oceans. I used to think life got its start in black smokers, but that is a bit too extreme of an environment.But alkaline hydrothermal vents, with just the right chemistries, with a similarity between and high Ph cell interior and low Ph sea water, along with iron/sulfur catalysts that are at the heart of practically every nanomechanical respiration mechanism that cells possess, just looks too right not to be true.All that needs to be done is to set up a working experiment that demonstrates it, rather like Miller's and Urey's lightning-in-a-bottle that created amino acids. (Now,  pretty much a curiosity as evidence suggests early Earth's atmosphere looked nothing like the Miller/Urey experimental mix.So, consider. Life did not appear in some warm pond. There was no primordial soup. Early Earth (and  early Venus, and early Mars) had an atmosphere of water vapor, CO2, and nitrogen, but very dense. All those artist's conceptions of early Mars' blue oceans are fantasy. Instead, picture what Venus looks like now, blanketed in murk, and that is the early Earth.Consider: The faint young sun paradox. The sun was 30% as bright as it is now 4 billion years ago. And yet all rock evidence says Earth had water on it. Not a hellish lava Earth, and not a frozen solid Earth, as we would expect. Same with Venus. Same with Mars. But Venus and Mars never developed life. Why not? My guess is, no magnetic field. The early sun was hissing, spitting kitty cat of radiation and solar flares. Without a magnetic field to protect them, the sun stripped Venus and Mars of their atmospheric hydrogen, and they were doomed from the get-go. The sun was also pumping out huge volumes of UV radiation, not to mention all the planets getting pummeled with the leftovers of planetary formation. The only safe place to be is at the bottom of the ocean.So, that's my argument. Life - as bacteria and archaea - got started down there, and it got started very, very quickly. So, given the cosmic abundances of chemicals that make up our kind of life, given the favorable thermodynamic properties of molecular formation that make our kind of life probable, one would expect a Universe full of (microbial) bugs.Okay, fair enough. What about complex life? Eukarya? That is the scandal. As Lane argues, it probably happened only once, and it involved an archaean host and a bacterial enosymbiont. The bacterial component turned into what we call mitochondria, and the archean host swelled up into the giant chimeric monster of a cell we call eurkaryotes.Kudos to Lin Margulis to pushing the argument for this insight of cells merging. But! The evidence suggests it only happened once. All the other stuff inside complex cells, the double-walled nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, the flexible cytoskeleton and flagella are NOT further symbiots absorbed. There is no evidence to suggest this.Meaning, the origin of the eurkaryotes was a one-time freak accident. Oh, perhaps that's a bit of hyperbole, but not much. Meaning, probably all those buggy bacterial mat planets out there in the Cosmos, stay bacterial mat planets out in the Cosmos. Four billion years on, and they've made zero effort to improve themselves.As Lane suggests, nothing is more conservative than a bacteria. The weird, monstrous, chimerical patchwork Frankenstein's monster which is us may just be a one-in-a-Cosmos shot.All the more reason to be nice to other."},

This creation and submission would be considered in today's terminology a FAIL. It's a pity that this term, which pretty much applies to everyone and all circumstances, has entered into the snarky descent of the treadmill of pejoration.There's nothing wrong with fail. In fact, I often tell my students \"No shame in fail\".Case in point. Last night I used up my personal studio time to tutor a kid in the Design II class. Design II moves the students from two-dimensional works to three-dimensional, in preparation for the Sculpture. The sculpture professor teaches the class. He has basically had enough of this kid, and so he was handed off to me.Look, I understand the sculpture professors dismissal of the kid. He's got his favorites, whom I call little poodles, and for whom art is effortless, or nearly so. They are easy to teach and they always follow the rules. He has little patience for the strugglies and problem children.I get the strugglies. I get the broken toys. I get the problem children. I have no problem with that. The art they make is often awkward, clumsy, misshapen, deformed, disfigured.Fantastic.Always always far more interesting than the perfectly crafted and perfectly bland art that the poodles make. The rejected kids have a had time following the rules, often because the rules are incomprehensible to them.So, this kid last night, obviously is within the autistic spectrum and also is tourettic with a profound verbal tic. But he's earnest, hard-working, wants desperately to get it, and is willing to put in whatever time and effort is necessary to get it.Well, shit, I really had not choice but to see what I could do to help him.He had been in the Design I class. I had been told by the instructor that he struggled in that class. A lot of the students in there were snickering at him, because he's weird and a retard. That kind of shit makes want to crack some skulls and get in some faces. But the nice story is, a girl in the class, a gorgeous stunning brilliant girl, stepped up to the plate, moved her stuff over to his table, provided him some support and companionship and silenced the snide little poodles.Good on her!This poor kid just didn't have the first idea of where to start. Two dimensional composition was hard for him. He can't understand basic spatial composition. He can't read a ruler. He doesn't understand what angles are. And the assignment is to create platonic solids from the cutouts on paper. So, anyway, I spent an hour and a half with him, tried about five different approaches to the problem. I had him ignore the instructions, gave him lots of paper, scissors, masking tape, the occasional timely advice, and said, make the solid as close as can, don't worry if it is exact, and have fun. Don't be afraid to make mistakes.I had to some arithmetic for him, but I made him watch me do the work. I had to show how to work a protractor and compass, but he had to do it. Because we learn by doing. I wasn't going to strictly speaking doing the work for him.\"It's just pentagons and equilateral triangles. Just keep on cutting them and piecing them together\", I said. I had him cut out each face and tape it together, and then I had him take it apart and lay it out as a contiguous piece on paper. And then draw it. Then cut that out and fold it, and tape it together. It was nice to see at the end of evening that he made kind of a fucked-up but recognizable icosidodecahedron.\"I think I'm starting to get it\" he said."},

And then what?So, food. Again. Still. Probably for awhile. Hey, let's talk about Oliver Evans. I think in many respects, Oliver Evans kicked Leonardo DaVinci's ass when it came to inventions. True, Leonardo came with lots of unworkable and impractical inventions, a lot more than Evans, but unlike Leonardo, Evan's rubber always hit the road.Oliver Evans, along with Richard Trevithick, came up with the high pressure steam engine.  Oliver Evans built the Orukter Amphibolos, the world's first automobile and the world's first amphibious vehicle. When he drove it through Philadelphia's Center Square in 1805, thousands gathered in amazement.But much important a contribution was Evan's automatic flour mill, developed to fruition around 1789.\"He saw the method by which millers turned wheat into flour and he was disgusted by the crudity, waste, and dirtiness. A mill customarily employed four men and a 'hopper boy' to clean, grind, cool, sift, and pack. One strong man carried three-bushel sacks up ladder-like stairways and dumped the grain into cylindrical 'rolling screen' that freed the grain of its chaff and dirt. A boy raked the cleaned grain into a funnel or hopper leading to the second-floor millstones, driven by waterpower. The warm, moist, ground meal was packed into buckets and hoisted to the third floor. It was spread out on the floor to cool and dry. A third man pushed the dried meal into a vertical chute. Gravity carried it into cylinder covered in bolting cloth. Once sieved, the flour fell into a chest and a fourth man  shoveled it out into barrels. In all this labor, dust was raised, grain was trampled underfoot, and the flour quality was very mixed.\"*   \"Mixed\" was an understatement, the flour typically had manure, insects, offal, trash, and any number of other very undesirable things embedded within it. Aside from the amount eaten by vermin, most of it spoiled before it could make it to market - where it was used anyway.Evans' ingenious automatic integrated production line used one man, doing the work of, who could process 300 bushels an hour. In addition, the raw gain emerged as smooth flour untouched by human hand, devoid of hopper dust, footmarks or insects. Footmarks, in case you haven't figured it, was anything that became attached from the incredibly filthy mill dirt and mud of the mill yards.His process was promptly denigrated as \"a set of rattle-traps, and also shamelessly ripped off by millers up and down the Eastern seaboard, and it was not until Congress passed an act for the Relief of Oliver Evans, signed into law by President Jefferson in 1808, that he was able to receive partial recompense. As usual, as is such the case of so much of capitalism in America, his inventions were \"stolen fair and square\". From the monies recovered, he founded the Mars Works west of Pittsburgh, continuing to manufacture steam engines until his death. The steam engine was something for sure. But, more importantly, there is little doubt that Americans, eating flour milled by Evans' mills, were more likely to live to tell the tale, and certainly had an impact in being able to reproduce at \"biological maximum\", and spread westward ho.*From They Made America, by Harold Evans with Gail Buckland and David Lefer"},

Literally.You may recall in yesterday's essay I called Steve Jobs a dickless asshole. Jobs used this term of disparagement all the time, so it stands to reason that he found it hurtful in the extreme. It follows we as a society should make an attempt that he should forever after be known as a dickless asshole. Nothing really wrong with that, considering how powerful the asshole niche is within the society of us ape-shaped bugs, and for that matter, how it seems to be a near cosmic rule in organizations. I would hazard to guess that if we ever meet space-faring aliens, they have good representative asshole niche - unless they've managed to find a way to be both effective and nice.Napoleon really is a dickless asshole though. During his autopsy, the doctor removed some souvenirs, and so his dick meandered through that grisly subset of the global commodities market known as reliquaries until settling in New Jersey. Cosmic irony would have dictated that it reside next to a jar filled with Rasputin's cock, but no. I guess.Anyway, what the fuck am I talking about? I went back and read yesterday's essay, and I had to ask \"Kurman? Was there a fucking point to any of that?\" I think there was, is, but it's gonna take a while for it all to cohere  - or congeal - into something. I think it has to do with big picture items and long term trends. But honestly, I'm pretty sure that the general anesthesia from two weeks ago scraped a good 10 IQ points of my brain, and maybe permanently. Add that to the other four operations going under, and the ten concussions I've suffered, and I suspect one more trial under the knife, or one more conk on the noggin, and all I'll be able to type is \"Meow\".Ferguson(Oh, and that ape-shaped bug crack? Not really meant as insult, more a realistic observation of our place in the larger universe. And whether \"bug\" refers to Ecdysozoa or Eubacteria really doesn't matter as both have admirably solved 99.999% of the survival problem and are worthy of emulation).So I suppose one of the themes from yesterday was about energy, but the stress was not necessarily upon our most recent sources - oil, gas, coal, nuclear - that have allowed the big accelerating anomaly our species has undergone lo these past three centuries, but rather the much more important energy source known as food.Food, baby, food!Any long term trend, any big picture item must treat this as the salient of all discussions. True, oil, gas, and coal, have opened up new venues and ventures to our species, but in many respects, all they've really done is added a turbocharged hemi to an already very sleek and stylish automobile - that incredible robust time-tested might-as-well-be-Promethean-nanotechnology we call eukarya in human form (and of course the holobiontic menagerie that surrounds and contains us like that hokey wizarding Force in those hokey Star Wars movies).And if we are to talk of, to bump it up a category, Life, then we must talk of organization, networks, whether communal or parasitic, swarm or dissipative structure, centralized or distributed, fractal or Pareto dispersed.(One quick aside about food, and another dickless asshole known as Putin. Jared Diamond's scholarship in Guns, Germs, and Steel may be slipshod, loose, and sloppy, and he may accused of geographic fatalism, but he does have a point about food zones. Longitudinal (east-west) food zones are preferable to latitudinal (north-south) food zones for propagation of staples, but in a world of climate change - assuming that favorable conditions travel to the poles, and this is a coarse assumption - the food zones will not travel with them. Latitudinal food zones (ignoring storm, flood  and drought) are to be preferred. Which means the Ukraine is fucked as a food zone, and Russia as well. Putin is wasting his time. The fact that got he caught with his pants down by failing to move most of Russia's arms-making capacity out of the Ukraine shows him to be a short-sighted fool, rather the strong manly chess master American conservatives so desperately whank off to).So, political organizations (and, for that matter business organizations, which are based upon centrally planned dictatorships). What we know is basically every form has been tried and found wanting, but some forms are worse than others. Confederations, for example, don't work. In America, they have tried twice, and both have been dismal, utter failures. Anarchy, for that matter, I don't think has even ever been tried, as it is contrary to the very idea of organization and principles of networks of social creatures. Grover Norquist, clueless - and possibly dickless - asshole, mischaracterized Burning Man as a self-organizing anarchic emergent community when it was nothing of the kind. Burning Man was - is -  a highly regulated, highly policed, luxuriously subsidized annual expedition to the South Pole - but without the death and cannibalism and frostbite and gangrene.So then the question is granularity of control. I for one prefer Big Government because it's so big and monitoring (at least historically) so remote and lax that it was easy to get away with a lot of shit, and still get a lot of free stuff for free from the taxpayer.(I have to admit, my views of governance are moving away from the Lockean social contract theory, and heading more towards the Serresian layered mutual abuse social parasitism theory, and more on that later maybe).But let's get back to that idea of layers of categorical filters and control points. The American Founding Fathers, perhaps swinging the pendulum too far the other way after being subjected to the parasitic abuse of the jolly olde British Empire (ignoring their own parasitic land theft and security needs against the dreadful Savage which said empire supplied in return). Even when the United States in Congress Assembled proved to be wholly unworkable, members of the Constitutional Congress were still staining their pants so badly over the return of tyranny that they much preferred the idea of state and, more importantly, local control.Problem is, local government can be the most stringent dictatorship of all (and as such, is NOT the modern system of government per Foucault's observations on the panopticon). I mean, I much prefer that the government be way the hell over their in Washington DC, with layers and layers and layers of bureaucracy distancing them from me, and all the silly little incestuous CEO-type buttheads stuck in one little easily nuked enclave. True, their are always exceptions to the rule. True, technology is changing so rapidly that the monitoring points are getting closer and closer into my business and privacy, but this is the cost of being a social creature. And besides, monitoring and control technology is part and parcel of the involving arms race of deceit, which I consider a lot more fun than the usual idea of arms race."},

If you start at around 50,000 BCE, that puts the total number of dead people preceding our current 7 billion at around 107 billion or so.You ever think there will ever be 107 billion people living at some point in the future? I doubt it, and if they are, they'll be infesting the solar system rather than Earth in some Kardashev level 1.4 (some 10 to the 22nd power watts to play with, if my math is right) civilization. And I also doubt you would strictly call them people, or at least, not people in ape form. And maybe not even in a watery carbon substrate.Funny thing, or not so funny thing is, where do get the cheap energy for all those people? Well, that's the not the problem is it? It's cheap energy density that is the problem, the same way that lake or a river is good for waterwheels, but a narrow channel is much, much better.Consider how we get by with just coal, oil, and gas. All those little archea and bacteria, laying down near teraton geologic deposits of rock and shale and carbon and all good stuff, their ghostly little selves outnumbering present populations some 20-30 to 1, means there is just a shitload of gas, coal, and oil still available. And that's not really the problem, to get an appropriate energy density to be useful, extraction has to stay below some constraint.That's really not the problem is it? Food is the problem. Last I checked, food needs soil, air and water, and that's about it. Oh, it need a little bit more than that, but that's still far more worrisome and sophisticated a task than simply drowning in your own shit and floating to the bottom of the sea to be covered up by sediment and turned into more or less pure carbon.   Because when you think about it, the whole system of food, which is to say the geologic environment, plus bacteria and archea, plus eukarya in the form of plants and animals, all of it based on a universal chemical dance of proton gradient and redox replenishment that makes our current best energy density look like pathetic little weenie sparks (seriously, the electric potential across a 6 nanometer mitochondrial  membrane is like 400 million volts!), and the machinery to do it, makes even our most sophisticated machine look like a cumbersome tinkertoy. And all of it done through a incredibly massive parallelism and natural selection. Why, the whole of human civilization kind of pales in comparison. No wonder the godbotherers have a hard time dropping the silly Intelligent Design argument.Yeah, okay what's the point? You can talk about the Industrial Revolution, and I sure do agree it's a nontrivial event. But the agricultural revolution, plus the conquest of the New World (\"Pangea stitch'd together again), plus good 'ol poison gas Fritz Haber, plus Norman Borlaug, and countless other experimentalists and organizations, gets you all the riches that power all the little self-replicating robots in ape form, that can take oil, gas, coal, even nukes and add only a slight addition to the actual energy budget that we enjoy and allows us to watch all our little TVs and drive our little cars and drink our little drinks and smoke our little smokes, and build our little cyberspaces, and launch our little probes out into outer space. And the really interesting thing is how all this seemingly intelligent shit, writ large as emergent global behaviors, is still not much smarter than the dumbest microbes.Population growth of dumb things like usAmerica and the Soviet Union: two crabs on a beach. John Rockefeller and Standard Oil: a phagocytic amoeba. The dickless asshole Steve Jobs and Apple: an anaerobic flagellated protozoan parasite.Come to think of it, isn't life just parasitizing the Earth? And ain't we all glad Earth is kind to have a magnetic field?And it pretty much starts, I think, just to throw a date out there, around 1700CE. I pick that date, because (if we are lucky, and I am optimistic, and the period going forward towards, say, 2200CE or so is the spine of the S curve), that's the beginning of the Anthropocene, and everything before then pretty much looks the same. Meaning, if someone like Mark Twain, author of Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (and if there is anyone who should be allowed to time travel, it's Twain), were to start in 1700, and we send him back one hundred years at a time, there's not much that is different, noticeable different. But send him forward, and things start to happen!1800, maybe not so much, certainly improvement in our capacity to slaughter each other, 1900, for sure differences, but still recognizable to him. But 2000? Oh, the houses and streets still the same, and he able to understand most new technology. But 2100? 2200? Oh my!I am being optimistic. And maybe I'm underestimating Twain."},

There were constraints of course: available land, available work, the whims and needs of the bosses. My ancestors, coming in just after the Civil War, were the cheap peoples Europe exported in exchange for cheap food from America. The area my ancestors settled, Northern Indiana, strikingly resembles the Northern Plains of Germany. More specifically, Northwest Indiana, so I am told, very much resembles the current Federal State of Mecklenberg-Vorpommern, the \"Florida of Germany\", if you can believe that. My part of Indiana is called The Region, or more colorfully, the Armpit of Indiana due to all the industry.True, great-great-grand-daddy's country of origin is listed as Prussia (and the joke is when asked of our nationality we say \"Prussian-Norwegian, drunk and crazy!\"  - or  - \"doubly psychotic!\"), but we are from Mecklenberg. Lake country. Deep glacial lakes with sandy bottoms, clay-loess sandy soil, thick dark forests, the smell of a large tract of water nearby.(The lesser coat of arms of Mecklenberg has a bull, but I always thought it a laughing cow with a crown).(My mother's side of the family - hill people from Norway, and not so fortunate - ended up half in Chicago and half in Minnesota - lots of Hills in Minnesota - and doubtless had they their preference would have ended up in Vancouver or Seattle).Not so sure dad's side of the family was actually from Mecklenberg originally. When I hitchhiked Europe at the age of 19, I was pretty much topped-up full of stupid. I did managed to notice that I wanted to spend almost all of my time on the island on the island of Zealand, where Copenhagen is. It felt like home. The Danes, despite owning a peninsula, are really an island folk. And I enjoy island life.I did not visit Mecklenberg when I was there. It was behind the Iron Curtain in Eastern Germany, and Amsterdam beckoned as a more choice destination.I've a cold. Coughing, after surgery, especially abdominal surgery, with strains already placed upon the diaphragm, you would think would be agony. Well, yeah, kinda, but actually no.The fever and general muscle ache is no fun, and last night was the worst, with me waking up to a soaking wet bed. But today, thunderstorms in the morning, I lay about in fresh sheets and dozed. Finally, I got up and said I have to at least try to walk.(Eating? Not so much fun. Whatever opiates and other drugs they gave me have left a persistent bitter taste in the lower back corners of my jaw. Sugars are out of the question. Salt acceptable, and sour tastes the least objectionable. But I can tell you, like a dog given bowl of brandy, I have absolutely NO desire for intoxicants of any kind. I wish strenuous physical activity. Out of the question for a few weeks according to medical opinion).So, I went for a walk after the storms. Sun was out, humidity up there, I went past a new city park being converted back to wetlands. Sweat popping on my brow and UV on the skin felt pretty goddamn good. But best off all were the swampland smells. Hard to describe. Again, a sweetness that the lungs appreciate more the nose, but I also detected smell of hod-hewn clay. That was a smell back of earliest childhood, gardening in the backyard, the faint organics of broken up clay, released from when last the glaciers deposited it in its inorganic mineral matrix.The walk did me good. Feel pretty good now. I'd say the smells helped as much as the walk."},
{"title": "Turning Corners", "date": "Friday, September 4, 2015", "text": "I had a nightmare, actually a series of nightmares last night, which suggests that in that strange, discrete-phase, two-steps-forward-one-step back form of recuperation we all seem to go through, I'm coming closer to turning the corner. Which is to say I feel remarkably less subhuman today.If you think of me as a turn-of-the-last-century dreadnought, and cut open my riveted hull platings to reveal a cross-section of the decks within, you'd have witnessed the black gang of the engine room desperately shoring with timbers and bedding the stave holes and breaches. And a little homunculi captain up on the bridge wing shouting useless orders to the sailors on deck scurrying about.Still, a much better situation than if things had gone otherwise, with the cold Atlantic waters rushing in to confront superheated boiler chambers and coal-fired furnaces, the whole enterprise going to smithereens and up to the heavens in a massive explosion known to maritime folk as the release of  'the black soul'.Oh, did I mention I'm reading Dead Wake? Just about done and had enough of that time thank you.One nightmare I remember was actually looking at the wounds inflicted upon me through some magic glass, the tissues and fissures outlined in striking technicolor 3D. A voice, Satan perhaps, offered up as all the pain could go away and I would be rendered whole again if I liked. I wasn't sure, so a demo was performed on a separate creature, I know not of what fashion.The interior 3D view of the creature, perhaps a grievously wounded fish or lizard, was all the blues and greens and yellows of copper-oxide shades and hues. An almost invisible conical ray, like a science fiction ray, scanned the creature and it was made whole.I assented, and watched the science fiction conical ray pass over my abdomen. The pain disappeared, but the tissues depicted in the magic glass, formerly lustrous and glowing with a lovely inner jewel-like light, turned to cheap plastic, as if my body had been polymerized by Herr Doktor Gunther von Hagens. The vitality and internal light of the tissues were gone, replaced by cheap powdered colorants and industrial pigments.I was no longer life, but simulated life, an ersatz creature. It made me wonder if the universe itself were not similarly created by that voice. And then I woke up. I had sweat the bed.Well, if the Universe is a simulation, there's a lot of people I have to shoot.Speaking of simulations, I'm thinking about that quote 'AI' unquote quote 'painting like a grand master' unquote science swoon item from the other day. It's along the lines of the fun Deep Dreaming convolutional neural net playing with image filters from a month ago.Well, I read that paper so you don't have to.  Not sure it's that impressive, but here, the feed-forward nets combine two feature maps involving image recognition and the texture map of various painter's paintings, combining the filters to produce a grand-master's rendering of a photo. Huh. Why is a Raven Like a Writing Desk? from Gene Kogan on Vimeo.But this got me back to thinking how swarms and neural nets is pretty much the same thing. And that got me to thinking about Uber. Uber, of course, is the taxi hailing service that you have on your phone. We are told it is a disruptive innovation that improves lifestyle and makes the economy more efficient. Uhm, no.Uber (and Lyft)  is a rentier app emplaced over our current walkie-talkie radio networks that allows monetary extraction from you, to them, through the very, very old labor practice of pimps and whores.It is a parasitism. Municipalities, of course, could offer up a free app that allows you the rider and a driver to do the same thing without the need of a middle man scraping your living room walls for saltpeter. A free municipal ride app (and more importantly, swarm route optimizer) is still parasitic in the form of taxation, but still…some of the best and most efficient people moving is done by public transport. Sorry, entrepreneurs and invisible handers. I got your invisible hand.The beautiful thing is now we have hyperparasitism. There is an app out that will compare ride sharing prices for you. I love it. What dirty tricks will these creepy organizations play to resolve this?So, what's the real innovation? Why, radio dispatch, of course!I can remember taxi call boxes on the street. right up until maybe the mid seventies, which corresponds with the first cell phones. I'm almost positive, that transport optimization software was available then. I could d have been in on that, maybe using swarms. I am such an idiot."},

(Now not a farm, a manicured suburbia surrounding the old O'keefe farmhouse, although the pond where I fished for bluegill is still there out back). Even though it is not the idyllic countryside of my youth, I revel in the wild sweet smells of late summer, that spicy sweet smell of weeds and overgrown ditch vegetation. It's hot. It's humid. Id' have whined about it a few weeks ago, but it's real, and out of my control, and I can do nothing but endure it.I wonder how hot it is? I check my phone to look for Valparaiso weather, and it is more than ready to be helpful. It is suggesting spellings. Google wants to butt in to help. This is not what I want. The robots, the nets of deep learning are stumbling over each other with suggestions, assistances, cute playful coddlings and nudging assurances.STOP  FUCKING HELPING ME!(By the way, it is 86F and 66% humidity).

The most damning words a leader can hear about their administration is \"he meant well\".Speaking of Deep Neural Nets, what about the old TV trope of Herman's Head, or the \"What Happens During An Orgasm\" NASA control room vignette in Woody Allen's spoof of \"Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask\"?It's got to be an old theme. Hobbes' Leviathan for starters maybe. The more contemporary Gargantuan Mecha. Is there a term? Ship of a person crewed by homunculi shortened to what?How old is this theme?

I can remember one old girl telling me about her ulcerative colitis in the cafeteria at the college. I said, do you mind? I'm eating lunch. Didn't faze her a bit. So, here is my shamelessness, a picture of my robot-inflicted wounds from surgery.Have I no public sense of decency? Nope.It's a lot better than getting cut navel to backbone with a samurai sword across the rib cage. I'm still swollen on the left side and curiously the right side hurts worse.The thing is they had me walking the eight hours after surgery. I did about a thousand yards before I pooped out. They do it because they are worried about lung function. The nurse who assisted me was about twelve years old and weighed half my body weight. She couldn't have kept me from fainting and falling if there had been a platoon of her.Friday and Saturday nights was off-and-on bad sleep or fever dreams. I had that recurring sick time nightmare that my brain was a calculator forced to do innumerable arithmetic operations by an evil accountant. Plus, I'm interrupted by staff drawing blood, providing medication, taking temperature and blood pressure, so it wasn't until I got home yesterday that I got a solid fifteen hour nap in. That really helped. I've walked about a mile and half since Friday, and after spending time in the meat locker of the hospital, the 90 degree/100% humidity is just the kind of hothouse conditions this delicate flower needs.Speaking of delicate flowers, I've changed my mind about Donald Trump. I actually think he is currently doing us all a public favor by godbothering the idiot conservatards. It really doesn't matter that I am personally not a fan of his, that I find many of his views despicable. Personal likes and dislikes should not enter the picture. He's shaking things up, shaping the narrative to expose the ridiculousness of the candidates positions, and making the right people uncomfortable about the wrong things. This is classic showmanship.The sole fact that Trump has made (anti-rich-people's-tax) Grover Norquist squirt out a little stain from his overly constricted sphincter, the idea that - oh, what a world! what a world! Trump could destroy all of Norquist's beautiful wickedness - provides me a great deal of smug satisfaction.It's a very fine piece of performance art in the tradition of P.T. Barnum, and I appreciate it. Nothing personal.Speaking of which, one of the things I noticed about the hospital was a lack of distraction. Oh, sure, there was safe and staid hotel art sprinkled about the floor, but I really, really needed distraction. Art would have helped. Especially bad art, something I could object to.I'm realizing that artists, writers, and performers (pace Mr. Trump) are incredibly egotistical. How dare I share with you things about me? (Because really, that's art and letters are about: me, Me, ME! Look AT ME!!!)And yet, it really is nothing personal. Artists and writers are trying to provide a bright and shiny lie that gets you off dead ass center and look around for a change. Enough of the navel gazing. They make you, for just a second, think about something besides you. Doesn't matter what it's about, or whether it is of good taste.So, the hospital really needs that. A lot.Well, I'm about pooped writing this up, and back to shameless self-promotion that is my primary mission right now. And also to squeeze out a solid poop and get myself back to some semblance of normal.Do you want an update on that?P. S. A solid thank you to everyone who has visited or expressed concern or asked about my well-being. I love you guys.P.P.S. This was really hard to do, composing this.

From there, they sailed down to the Ohio River, to the Mississippi, past New Orleans, through the Gulf of Mexico, the Panama Canal and from there to Pearl Harbor. The fact that they could do this at all is quite astonishing.We Americans tend to think of ourselves as exceptional, which is hyperbole, but what is without a doubt exceptional about us is our geography. No other nation, no other continental region, has a riverine transport system even remotely equivalent to the Mississippi River Basin.None. Couple this with some of the richest soils in the world, a relatively benign and stable climate, and you have an effective food power second to none. We bucket head Americans literally fell ass backwards into a really good deal.The US Department of Agriculture was established in 1862 under Abraham Lincoln. Think of that.Here the Union was fighting a war, and yet still had the time and resources to engage in, not one but two, Apollo Moon Launch programs of the time: the Transcontinental Railroad, and the great geophysical inventory of the soils and seeds of the US farming communities.The US of A, already a formidable food power as early the 1820s, set about modernizing its agrarian practices to achieve maximum efficiency for the farmer. Lincoln appointed Isaac Newton (the other one) to the position of commissioner. Newton was renowned for innovative farm practices, and immediately set about on a program of analyzing soils, grains, fruits, plants, vegetables and animals best suited for each region.(Newton also initiated the program of food prospectors, which to this day scour the globe for useful plants).The agriculture data compiled was of such an astoundingly fine granularity (down near to what grew best where within a detail of mere yards) that the libraries and museums comprise some of the most extensive and thorough collection of information ever acquired. It was literally the Internet of its day, and had a more profound impact Western civilization than can be imagined.Today, agriculture accounts for perhaps 4-5% of US GDP, but during the latter half of the 19th century, and much of the 20th, our status as a food power, was unchallenged.WWI (not the first war where intentional food scarcity was used, but certainly the first big war) can be considered the first big food war. Germany, the most advanced nation on Earth at the time, relied upon foreign imports for nearly half of its food. Great Britain, the most powerful nation of Earth, relied upon imports for 2/3rds of its food.Food shortages curtailed the war, especially for Germany. There is evidence to suggest American food won the war for the Allies - not the intervention of American armed forces.This is still very true today. It's true that in our weird ear of industrial agriculture, oil and gas are used to grow food, but the real point of oil and gas is to expedite and assist in food production.Food power is the only real power."},

More to the point, I'd like to create a specific kind of heterogenous bot swarm in the form of neural nets with these simulated bots and see what kids of patterns they'd create.I doubt this will happen given my time constraints (at my dicking-around pace, I would if only I had another 150 years...), but it fits in nicely with the direction of thought I've been in lately.A while back, Google caused a bit of stir with deep dreaming recursive visual imagery. The 'deep' part comes from a deep layered neural net that was used. Google, and many others, are reverse engineering brains with deep layered neural net programs. The nets are much more difficult to train than shallower nets of 3-4 layers of simulated neurons. Oftentimes, the neurons are simply treated at a higher level of abstraction as black boxes with generic inputs and outputs.Hmm. Black boxes. Bots. Similar to what Buzz does, or claims to do. And neural nets, if they are to be truly reverse engineered, really need to take into account more than just neurons. The net is itself heterogenous, with different cell types, and - most important - pretty much supported by the glia.Glial cells, it appears, seem to do more than just support neurons. They often seem to wield neurons. And the whole thing seems to be with swarming behaviors. So, brain like a swarm, not surprising, and worth pursuing.More important, the brain alone is embodied, and the body is itself a very distinct heterogeneous swarm called a holobiont.Holobionts have entered my news feed. Darwinian selection seems to occur not just at the level of the gene, or organism, but at the group holobiont level. This is unsavory news to plodding orthodox bishops of biology like Richard Dawkins.Well, too bad. It's definitely where I think things are headed in biotech and AI. I really don't care about expert testimony to the contrary."},
{"title": "Food As Weapon", "date": "Wednesday, August 19, 2015", "text": "We are told by wikipedia that food was first used as a weapon in modern times. I don't see that.I remember reading an article detailing dig sites from the Mesolithic/ Neolithic. In earlier dig sites, all  human bones are robust, indicating some type of fair distribution of food. But then something happened, and you start seeing evidence of malnutrition in the bones.I'm not saying intentional starvation started back then, based upon my anecdotal reading, but I'd say it's a fair guess that it was easier strategy to pursue against a sedentary or semi-sedentary population than against nomadic hunter/gatherers. I'm sure there were some paleolithic examples of prey or range denial.Still, intentional starvation would seem to me to be a product of civilization. Certainly genocide and slavery were part of the Neolithic cultural package, so why not food as weapon - false scarcity - as well?Image courtesy: NatureNowadays, with climate change, we should start to see the Big Squeeze, which is to say, food growing regions that historically are advantageous by being geographically spread out along longitude will now be challenged by latitude.I don't think it's going to go down the way we think it will, with rain and food belts moving towards the poles. If, as I suspect, the arctic and antarctic regions receive the brunt of the heat, and the tropics don't heat up much at all, we can expect a squeeze of food growing zones from both directions.This does not bode well for Eurasia, South America, or Australia/Oceania. Hard to say about North America. It really depends upon rain patterns, which may become sporadic and unstable.Image courtesy: Nordpil.comIt may possibly work out for Africa. One great irony would be to see the Sahara bloom. In which case, hey, more power to them, and completely in keeping with my \"It's Africa, Stupid\" predilections that the 22nd century will be the African century.I could be wrong.One thing is for sure, now that food is a spreadsheet item (like every other physical base for fiat currency), market forces are really going to fuck things up for everyone."},
{"title": "My Medicine Name is a Haiku", "date": "Thursday, August 13, 2015", "text": "Q: Can a lazy atheist have a spirit animal?A: Yes, but it may not be well cared for.Did I tell you I have a spirit animal? It's a horse, just so we get that out of the way. I know it's unusual for someone such as me to have a such a powerful spirit animal, one usually more associated with shamans and messengers of the dead.Last I checked, I have no messages.I have used associations from many cultures in examining my spirit animal. Norse myths, of course, and since I was born on a Wednesday, and am full of woe, I am an Odin's child. Odin had the horse Sleipnir, the eight legged horse, often thought of as four men carrying a coffin. Odin's rune is Ansuz, Aminita Muscaria, prophecy and revelation. The converse of which is associated with Loki, the fire giant, so we got the pyromania tie-in. The converse Ansuz is also associated with lack of clarity or awareness, so, and check and check. I've studied native american cultures, especially Plains Indian and Lakota meanings, and horse is pretty damn straight-forward. Power, freedom, but also difficult to control.I didn't pick the horse. The horse picked me. A horse is a beautiful animal, but it is also a vain, stupid, and reckless animal. And that's all me.I also have a medicine name. I don't think I want to tell what it is. It's actually still in progress, not quite fixed or gelled into a final or coherent form, and given the horse nature this should be no surprise.I won't go into boring detail. I'll give you the short version. Last year I participated in a medicine ceremony down in Texas. It was a wonderful experience that I would recommend to everyone. The ceremony was established upon traditional Native American lines with those wonderful big skin drums and songs, and was officiated by a guy named Ta Tanka. There were others who would assist in naming, but I got Ta Tanka, probably because I was a problem child. It didn't matter that it was all white peoples there, with not a single Native American present.I'll tell you I felt extremely dorky and self-conscious about the whole thing. We performed a dance around a fire, and the moon at that time of year was not only full, but in close orbit. Huge. I'll get to that in a second.I realized pretty quickly, dancing around the medicine wheel and a large roaring fire, that if I was going to get past my discomfort, I would have to treat this ceremony as an ordeal. And so I did, I expended as much physical effort as I could, the equivalent of unending wind-sprints, leaping and jumping, to get myself out of my skull.I suffered in order to get past my self-consciousness. I did for sure, I almost blew out an Achilles tendon, had to ice down afterwards, and my ankle was not the same for a month afterwards. So, I kept dancing and running until I was exhausted and could not take another step. I stood on a ridge, and the moon came out and it was the biggest fucking moon I've ever seen. I stood there, and closed my eyes, and said \"Alright, spirit vision. If you are gonna come to me, now's the time! Let's go. Chop chop.\"Nothing. Not a damn thing, and I despaired. And then, with my eyes still closed I see just this tiny little circle of green, about the size of a half-dollar a foot from my face. And I'm like, what the fuck is this? It's hard to see, but the closer I look the less unfocused it is, and it resolves to a white horse's skull nestled in very lush grass.I report this to Ta Tanka. He asks me a bunch of questions about the horse, what is it doing, how did it die, where was it going, what did it feel like.  He writes in a notebook, and then has me go back out and dance for the answers. I try to dance like a horse would, and after while, I don't even have to try.As we proceed with this collaboration in fleshing out this tiny vision, I remember at one point asking him \"What if these revelations are all just me making all this shit up?\" He replied \"What's wrong with that?' I didn't have an objection to that and so kept dancing.By the end, about two in the morning, I'm beat down physically, but quite happy mentally, as we have worked out my medicine name. Or rather, we worked out the starting point for my medicine name. It's changed since then. I think I need a few more ordeals to completely work it out. But it's a start.You notice this whole thing was pretty much about me? Horse written all over this."},
{"title": "The Case of the Lazy Atheist", "date": "Wednesday, August 12, 2015", "text": "Q: Can a atheistic materialist have sacred things?A: Yes, and that's not even hard question. That doesn't even require holding two mutually contradictory beliefs in your head at the same time. (Am I a atheistic materialist? Most of the time. Does it matter? I don't think so).So, let's say you are an atheist, maybe even an apneumatist. (Or is it apneumist?  Or aphasmist? Which is to say you don't believe in the survival of personality beyond death). The two issues are independent of each, in fact orthogonal.So, you don't believe in God. Period. You are in the No God column, and may or not be in the No Soul row. So, the universe is miraculously created out of nothing, as far as the evidence suggests. And you, dear reader, miraculously appeared out of the something which was formerly nothing. And in the vast amount of time the universe is here, which is considerable, you appear with relatively less duration than the most ephemeral of virtual particles.Which should suggest, at least it does to me, that every single teeny tiniest piece of time -the Planck time - that you exist, is precious, because the immense yawning voids of your non-existence stretch before and after you.  Because that.Did I say precious? How about sacred?And what do you do? You waste time. You watch TV. You do all sorts of meaningless things that add no meaning to an existence that may or not be crying out for meaning. (I'm assuming a certain existentialism calls for trying to provide meaning to life. Or you could be a nihilist. In which case, wow, do whatever you want,  I guess).So, you are a lazy atheist. By your own logic, you are committing a sacrilege by wasting time, So, know sin. It that bad? Hey, it's your precious time to waste, your sacred existence to let slip through your fingers. Why should you care? Should you care?"},

Plus I've been scrambling to get stuff done. Not that that's a entirely bad thing...But the spine looks GREAT!Part of the whole real world distraction is prepping and planning for still another surgical intervention!...Son of a-This time out under the knife is to get rid of my useless left kidney. As you can see in the photo, the kidney is no longer a kidney. It's a just a big old bag of stale piss using up half my abdomen. I'm getting it taken out August 28th.For those interested, I got a blockage in my left ureter to the bladder back in maybe 2012, and the kidney had itself an aneurysm and ceased functioning sometime in spring of 2013. I had two operations in the summer of 2013. At that time, it was hoped (by me) that the kidney would just atrophy away. (They wanted to remove it).No such luck. It's probably been trying to do it's job and slowly filling up with urine, with nowhere for the urine to go, so that now it is swelled up enough for me to notice it.I noticed around the holidays that I was experiencing more and more discomfort. When I went in for my physical in April, it had become an off-and-on knife in my side. It's still not painful all the time, but it's getting to be a regular ache with knife-in-my-side pain when I'm lying down more and more frequently. Which means I'm not getting much sleep unless I self-medicate with booze and dope. So, it's time to get the thing out.I should tell you this story. I was at the urologist for the final consultation, and the examination room walls are paper thin. In the exam room to one side was an elderly couple talking to their doctor about ED and viagra, and in another exam room was a mentally challenged man I'd sat next to in the waiting room, who probably was getting his very first prostate exam ever. The conservations got mashed up together into one and sounded like:Doc: \"Sometimes after orgasm, the erection will not immediately go away-\"Patient: \"OW!\"Doc: \"-you see that the erection-\"Patient: \"OWW!\"Doc: \"-the erection-\"Patient: \"OWWW! CUT IT OUT!\"You get the idea. When my doctor came in, I'm wiping away tears from laughing, and he thinks I'm distraught, getting ready to reassure me. No, that's not it, doc, you should have been in here a couple minutes ago.So, anyway, my urologist, who is Korean-American, is very inscrutable and stoic in demeanor. I think I've gotten him to laugh once. Maybe. Hard to tell.But when he started talking about the procedure, he got excited and animated because he gets to use the DaVinci robot on me to extract the kidney.  He's gesturing and mimicking his hand movements waldo-ing the robot controls.\"Wow, it sounds like you get to drive the Maserati!\" I observe.He laughs, pauses and says \"Yeah, and you're a good road.\"He could not have thought of anything more comforting to say to me.So, I got lots of shit to do the next two weeks. I'm not giving up my bronze casting class. I have the first day to inform them of the situation, cancel the next class, Labor Day weekend to recover, and back at it. They say it should be six weeks to get back to normal.They don't know I'm a fucking werewolf that will recover in about an hour. But I will baby myself for the full six weeks. I may be a monster, but I'm not stupid.More later as the surgery day gets closer.Oh, right, I did manage to get some cast class pieces done.

Certainly doesn't work all the time, but you have to admit the tactic is pretty brilliant. Rather than having to display through grisly ceremonies the power of the state, you suggest that  individuals self-regulate because their every unseemly act is observed. More importantly, unobtrusively observed.Government: We was kind of hoping you wouldn't notice.However, and again this is not a new phenomenon, there's also disapproval, shaming, shunning, ostracizing, vigilantism with a wink and a nod. With the internet, this can be taken to new levels. How many have had been put under the global magnifying glass? One must have avery, very thick skin indeed to handle the neutron beam of public scrutiny.Which means the selection criterion is biased towards the sociopathic elements. Not a particularly good thing, but that's just the way the arms race goes.

Not only the quantity, but the quality. Some of these miniatures, upon inspection, were really tiny and of exquisite detail and craftsmanship. I mean, inch high, and figuratively accurate right down to eye brows and dimples. For me to do something like that would drive me insane after about fifteen minutes.But when I saw the prices? Holy shit! I've been in the wrong business all along!Interestingly, they do not use 3D printing for this stuff yet.

That technology is the baseline from which the rest of the future will flow. We moved from medieval communications and transport to the modern. From speed of horse to speed of light. From horse and man power to steam and atomic monster power.Why, I ask, is it necessary to have ultraintelligent computers to realize the vision of the Vingean Singularity? Aren't the aggregate intelligences of the Monkey Hives enough? Did we not see all the requirements fulfilled pretty much by the 1870s? And for certain by the 1920s? And if so, does it not now boil down to competing visions of the future? Are we not still working our way through the disruptions and dislocations of this event? And are not the disruptions and dislocations increasing in frequency, accelerating over time?Does this explain the waves of addiction that we monkeys experience. Such as the Gin Craze? The Jazz, Weed, and Heroine Phase? The Amphetamine Craze? The Consumerist Insanity? Seen as adaptations to dislocation, to increasing isolation and stress, all of this drug taking and similar addictive behaviors all starts to make sense.

{"title": "Something-sumthing-punk", "date": "Thursday, July 2, 2015", "text": "Words suffixed with -punk: (back formation from cyberpunk) a fictional or aesthetic genre based upon the noun to which it is suffixedThe smell of cut pine makes me nostalgic and reminds me of working in my Dad's garage. So allow me to regress a little bit, literally, and ramble my way through late childhood/early adolescence - prior to the plastic model-making/rocketry/masturbation stage. We had a one-car garage, which seeing as it was a one bay situation, had room for a work bench and little else. There was no room for equipment such as a table saw or similar, and so almost every construction project was done with hand tools, or powered hand tools. Seeing as my great-grandfather was a cabinet maker, we had some kick-ass traditional hand tools. Anyway, my father would get on these household projects involving 2x4s and plywood, and he preferred screw fasteners over nails. I suppose that comes from being a Navy guy. Being a Navy guy, knowing that horizontal surfaces are crap magnets that hold dangerously unsecured sharp and heavy things ready to roll about and drop, my father covered every available vertical surface with pegboard, or hooks and holders. (Not that our house experienced much in the way of heavy seas, but still...) Clearly the Old Man had imparted his knowledge of tools and tool management (tool usage, fellow babies, is for Homo erectus types) upon us all, seeing as, going with military pragmatism, there was always a chance, slim though it be, that he could get shot in the head or similar such circumstance, and then what good was all that knowledge locked up within that now useless paternal unit skull?And so we were thoroughly vetted in all the manly arts of both additive and subtractive  manipulations of material instrumentality, making me pretty much ready, willing and able once the building stage of life commenced. Partial credit goes also to my oldest brother, who at about the same time took up the habit of amateur rocketry, and probably the accompanying habit of masturbation.And suddenly a new material was made available called balsa wood. I fucking loved the stuff as, unlike gummy pine, it was super easy to work with. Better still, the old man purchased a disc/ribbon sander that barely fit one end of the work bench, and a jigsaw. He never use either as far as I know. But I got my fair use out of 'em. (I have a fond winter memory of standing in melted and sloughed off black slush from the station wagon, wedged into the foot of free space between the car and the work bench, fingers slowing going numb as I worked on one goofy after another).I should point out that none of the things I made had any real or practical value. Even then I was making shit on the fly, whatever accidental shape or arrangement of shapes caught my fancy. Shapes. Platonic solids. At the time, the early 70s, I was exposed to Buckminster Fuller, and started making geodesics out of paper and balsa wood. I also found an obscure cut-out book on Pavlita generators, psychotronic twirlers, cone-shaped paper objects that you suspended from strings, and they would rotate when you stared at them. So, I really enjoyed spheres, and ellipsoids, cones, helixes, and the laminated cooling fins on motors and pistons, whatever that's called. I found taping together truncated cones end to end gave me a cylindrical camera bellows, a shape I which I still enjoy. And, once I tired of them, would burn them, or blow them up (I would on occasion use the tools for their intended purpose, try to make some weird unconventional rockets, which my father ended up calling 'trench warfare' weapons).So, the aesthetic involved bore a slight resemblance to things under the steampunk genre, but not. To most people I suppose that's what you would call it, but my tastes tended more towards more primitive technologies. Alembics, retorts, crucibles, the tools of alchemy. You could really throw my stuff under the alchemypunk aesthetic, but with anachronistic modern elements thrown in. Primitive electronics. Frankenstein's lab type of shit. Clockpunk, but some meddling with the forces of nature is implied. Frankenpunk, maybe.What's the point of this? Mainly to stress the message, I guess, that my stuff is NOT steampunk.But call it what you want."},

For those of you that don't care, Illinois is facing a budget crisis, because Rauner isn't getting his way.Big surprise, considering, unlike Scott Walker, Rauner does not have a compliant, obsequious, groveling legislature to grease the rails for him.Rauner accuses Illinois government of being corrupt. Yeah, duh. But what he doesn't seem to grasp is that the source of corruption comes from monied toads such as himself and his rich cronies. He would like to blame the unions, but considering union workers constitute less than 10% of the workplace economy, that doesn't seem to wash.As for corruption, a sturdy moral compass would be a good start. Rauner claims to be on the side of right action, but seeing as actions speak louder than words, and seeing as Rauner cheated on his first wife, I don't see how he can make any claim to being honorable.But you know, Rauner is just the symptom, and not the disease. The disease is the asshole niche.When a person is pampered, coddled, catered to, spoiled rotten, bowed and scraped to by sycophants and butthole lickers, been allowed to privatize the gains and socialize the losses, they become delusional, they become infantile.I'm not saying all rich people are infantile, but a damn large percentage is.Case in point. There is a well-married woman at the college who puts pottery to be bisqued on the wetware shelf with these little signs that say \"Fragile! Handle with care!\" As if her precious shit is going to be maltreated by ham-handed oafs and inferiors. Being the egalitarian that I am, I treat her stuff the same as everyone else's, which is, carefully. And it pisses the living shit out of me whenever I see those signs. I have to resist the temptation to fuck them up.Case in point. A fucker in a BMW races down the Jane Addams expressway, barely missing cars, and speeding at dangerous speeds, probably because \"he can\". The beautiful thing about this incident was he had to cut through lanes of traffic to get to the manual tollbooth, and at the last second a beat to shit POS junk truck cut him off and forced him to slam on the brakes so hard his vehicle shuddered and his tires smoked.My thought on that incident was, \"There is a God, and his name Fred Sanford\"!Case in point. This morning, dropping stuff off at the post office, I had the misfortune to get some rich bitch that pulled up in Mercedes sportscar behind me. She was in a oh-so-desperate hurry to get on with her important - more important than anyone else's - affairs, and tried to push her way through the line.\"Sorry!\" she attempted.\"No, you're not.\" I observed, blocking her progress.She made an exasperated sound and threw her mail at the clerk, leaving in a huff. Or a minute and huff.\"What are going to do with that mail?\" I asked the clerk. \"Oh, I'm going to do my job\", the clerk replied, \"even though I'd like to do something else with it.\"I was raised to be polite, considerate, and courteous. I've even had one ex-girlfriend tell me I was too polite. What she really meant was she didn't think I was assertive enough. But the thing I noticed was she wanted to me assertive as in be a rude asshole so we would get faster service/not have to wait/be treated better than anybody else.I'm not an asshole.

{"title": "The Last Confederate Surrender", "date": "Tuesday, June 23, 2015", "text": "150 years ago today, June 23rd, 1865, the last Confederate general surrendered. Obviously, the last official surrender, and the conflict continues, and will no doubt persist for another thousands years.I say this based upon the evidence, the universal fact, that every country and region contains some disgruntled group that nurses and nurtures the wounds and narratives of past conflicts.Why, there are people in the Middle East who are still bent out of shape about the Crusades.Wars come in two flavors, conventional and unconventional. In conventional wars, you have set piece battles, supply lines, field of operations, orders of battle, all that crap. Conventional war seeks to control the apparatus of the state.Unconventional warfare is guerrilla tactics, hit-and-run, sabotage, insurgency, terrorism. Unconventional war seeks to control the civil population. Without the civil population as logistic support, sustained combat is impossible.Both forms are, of course, parasitism. Practicioners of warfare tend to think of themselves as superior,  with noncombatants as subjects. They may seem to have the upper hand due to military might, but in reality, their existence, their sustenance and livelihood, is wholly dependent upon the civil populations as a host. They are fucking blood-sucking parasites whose existence no one would miss should they, tomorrow, vanish in a puff of smoke.I think the one disservice Ken Burn's documentary, the Civil War, did, was to romanticize and ennoble the Southern cause. The idea that they were fighting a losing battle from the beginning, that they were underdogs, engenders a sympathy to their utterly vile cause - slavery - which is wrong. Just plain wrong.Studies and statistics have shown that the institution of slavery has ennervated and enfeebled my fellow citizens below the Mason-Dixon line. Those of former Confederates states are, today not even remotely associated with all of the vile characteristics of this practice, are nevertheless malformed and retarded from this disgrace.I wish that it were not so. Call me stupidly idealistic, but I would prefer that everyone live up to their full potential, and any obstacle to this ideal I have no choice but to view as evil.So, do I think the Confederate battle flag is evil? It's a symbol, and the unfortunate tendency of we primitive superstitious Cargo Cult Americans is to think that by imbuing an object as a symbol, and ceremonially banishing it from our consciousness, that somehow the problem is fixed, everything is made right again. But it just ain't so.Do I think that state endorsement of the flag should be ended? Hell, yes. But we've all of us got a long, long way to go to end the problems if ever.Want to work against racism? Banishing a flag won't do it. Want to do something really constructive? Something that will be more than just symbolic, something that will have a real positive impact for everyone involved? Simple. End the War On Drugs. It's a hundred years old. It's time to stop it. It's a racist policy. It's an INCREDIBLY racist policy, and anyone who has examined it at length cannot come to any other conclusion.If you can show me any more important current institution of racism than the War on Drugs, I'd be quite astonished. The fact of the matter is it is a racist policy of the state which we can actually end in a short amount of time, and with only a small amount of effort, but it requires a large amount of will."},
{"title": "The Joker Effect", "date": "Friday, June 19, 2015", "text": "Michel Serres wrote The Parasite in 1982. He supposed that we individual people are all parasites feeding off the collective societal host. Rather than the usual idea of transactions operating under a societal contract of some type, with each transaction assigned an exchange value, one's dealing are instead assigned an abuse value. This peculiar notion has a lot going for it. Assuming that all us are pests, a more realistic model of society results.I once had an argument where I proposed that predation was the penultimate and final form of parasitism. I was told this could not be the case because parasites do not kill their hosts. What? Of course they do! One only need think of disease organisms.Parasite, being from para- \"between\", and -site \"food\", it generally means \"to eat at another's table\".Serres makes a point of viewing predation as an externality, a thing that happens to a host outside of the host, whereas we all know parasites live within the host. But consider humans both within society and the world, and you start to the idea. I remember a fun quote (paraphrased) from Serres about predators and parasites early in the book:\"Men in clothing live within the animals they devour. We are parasites, thus we clothe ourselves. Thus we live in tents of skin like gods in their tabernacles\".If we, in turn, view the agencies of our dealing and doings as such, many things become clear. Consider, for example, mathematical games that try to explain altruism. There is the Prisoner's Dilemma, of which I have written. But also the Public Goods game. In the PG game, each agent can contribute to a certain amount to a pot Once everyone has made a decision, the pot is split up. Cooperators always contribute. Defectors never do. Thus defectors benefit without cost. The Nash equilibrium for a such a game, where all agents are rationally self-interested, is for everyone to contribute nothing to the pot. The good old psychopathic Nash equilibrium. Of course, this doesn't happen in real life. So the game generally fails. Well, so what, it is a mathematical toy anyway, providing only skeletal hints at human behaviors.Well, let me also say that the Public Goods game is mathematically equivalent (more or less) to the Prisoner's Dilemma game (thus my use of the terms cooperators and defectors), but rather than participants contributing to a common good, they share a common punishment.Well, there's a new twist to this, the joker effect: cooperation driven by destructive agents.I read this paper so you didn't have to.This Public Goods game introduces a new character, the joker. Cooperators contribute at a cost, defectors don't contribute, but still benefit from being apart of the public pool. Jokers perform destructive actions on all other players. Interestingly, the dynamics between cooperators, defectors and jokers manifest a paper/rock/scissors cycle of equilibria. Even more interestingly, the model's cooperators lose to defectors in the presence of jokers when the destructive value d of jokers is not greater than zero.It doesn't mean jokers are evil, just that they must be destructive.Now, consider two jokers. Both made visits to Egypt. The latter joker was named Napoleon. In 1798, a French armada of 400 ships, with 36,000 French troops aboard, arrived near Alexandria. They ousted the parasitic Mamluk ruling elite, trashed the country, fired artillery on residential areas, raped Muslim women, pissed and shit in mosques, and otherwise abused and defiled the country. Later that year, a British naval squadron under Horatio Nelson destroyed the French fleet, trapping Napoleon and his armies in Egypt. Napoleon and his advisers abandoned the army, slipped through the British patrols, and slunk back to France.A power struggle ensued, with various factions eventually coming back under Ottoman control.The second joker arrived earlier in Cairo, in 1324, and was far more benign, but just as destructive. The ninth king of Mali, Mansa Musa, somewhat converted to Islam, made holy pilgrimage to Mecca. Mansa Musa is recognized as the wealthiest man in the history of the world, with a fortune in today's dollars of around 400 billion. He arrived in style, with an advanced guard of 500 slaves, a huge entourage, and 100 camels carrying gold. One Cairo official summed up his visit thus:\"This man spread upon Cairo the flood of his generosity, there was no person... who did not receive a sum of gold from him. The people of Cairo earned incalculable sums, whether by buying or selling or gifts. So much gold was current in Cairo that it ruined the value of money\".     Indeed, ten years later, the gold markets had still not recovered."},

{"title": "Mad Max Fury Road: A Review", "date": "Tuesday, June 2, 2015", "text": "In Egypt, in one of the museums, is a stone palette carving of King Narmer, the first pharaoh to unite and rule the upper and lower Nile. In the picture, Narmer is seen inspecting the corpses of his fallen enemies, who are decapitated and emasculated.I don't know where the heads and genitals are.image courtesy electrummagazine.comSo, Narmer is a great man. He has, through arms and force of will, created an empire where none existed before. The same could be said for Qin Shi Huangdi, the first emperor of China, who conquered the five warring states. Or Alexander the Great. Or Napoleon.Assholes all. Parasitic assholes every one. Why? There are any number of cases where great things have been done and built by people who are not assholes.So, clearly, being an asshole is not a requirement for great things to occur. So, why does the parasite asshole niche exist, and why the continued mythology of the Asshole Cult that worships the likes of Steve Jobs, etc? My thought is that the myth is propagated by assholes who wish to rationalize their own feculent behavior. Funny thing is, a lot of these assholes think they are doing right by society.Another interesting fact: you can kill off as many parasitic assholes as you care to, but, like a game of Whac-A-Mole, they just keep coming back. You've got to eliminate the niche, which is nigh on impossible.But why the niche exists (excluding the supernatural cause that the Almighty must dearly love parasites), I suppose we must look to game theory. In the game of the iterative Prisoner's Dilemma, there are cooperators, there are parasitic rat fink cheaters (otherwise known as Ayn Rand fans), and then there are what Michel Serres calls jokers. Jokers are unpredictable random connectors that break up the status quo between cooperators and parasites. One thing is for sure, game changers are rarely produced by the parasitic assholes who give us disruptive innovation. Game changing belongs to jokers.What does all this shit have to do with Mad Max Fury Road?I submit that Mad Max is a joker. More on that in a minute.Short version of my review: Go see this movie!Slightly less short version: To Mr. Miller? That'll do pig! That'll do!Slightly lesser short version: Go see this movie while you can see it on the big screen! This movie will not be diminished by viewing on home video, but you really, really need to see it on a big screen to appreciate it.Least short version: When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I went out of my skull with joy. I knew that I would be disappointed, and, if anything, my expectations were splendidly surpassed.This is a fucking fierce, relentless gem of a movie, destined to become a classic. If Mr. Miller creates the promised second two movies of the trilogy of this franchise, and maintains the same level of quality, these will be legendary.Mr. George Miller is no slouch when it comes to movie-making, and given the variety of films he has made, is multi-talented. Put Babe and the original Mad Max trilogy under any other director's belt, and you have an accomplished film maker.But, apparently, when you have thirty years of the right kind of simmering stew-making going on, back stories and notes, you could potentially end up with a carbonized mess of a movie sticking to the bottom of your pot (clue: never make a movie you developed and wanted to make in adolescence. examples: The Abyss, Interstellar), or, in this case, you make an action movie that basically goes out and crocks and curbs almost every other action director's movies.(The likes of Michael Bay's, Joss Whedon's,  JJ Abrams', James Cameron's, etc. movies have got to feel like they are hobbling around with a swollen, bruised nutsack and a mouthful of missing teeth).Honestly, there so many themes to explore here, I wish I had more time. I'll pick the themes I've thought most about.Well, first of all, I was asked to list the four Mad Max movies in descending order. I find that this activity really doesn't identify the quality or merit of the films, but rather provides insight into the psychological makeup of the list maker. But, here goes, and prepare to disagree.1) The Road Warrior2) Fury Road3) Mad Max4) ThunderdomeNow some people will say, what? Fury Road not at the top of the list? Thunderdome at the bottom? What's wrong with you?True, Thunderdome has lots of charm, humor, good scenes and characters in it, but it's just too weighted down with its own mythology. Mad Max has a lot less action, but the action is far more raw, visceral, earnest, and sincere - something that comes from doing something for the very first time with no rules or restrictions - or rather with Road Runner and Coyote Rules the only inviolable restrictions.And I put Fury Road behind The Road Warrior because in many ways RW was the template, the heart and soul, for the franchise. (Although pound for pound in intensity, FR is head and shoulders above the rest).Miller is smart (I'm not the first to point this out) to make sure that all of these movies within the franchise are stand alone and not necessarily consistent with each other. Why get weighted down in chronology and canon when you can fun doing different stuff? Why worry about minor inconsistencies when you can play with a little reimagining each time? Does anyone complain about the Adventures of Sinbad? Or the fact that contradictions abound in the Norse Myths?So, in Mad Max, civilization is just decaying, and resources are running out. Miller doubles down in Road Warrior with an explicit mention of war, but not nuclear war. It is only in Thunderdome that we are told there was a nuclear exchange (between whom we can guess, it was 1985, but the scenario is more likely a limited nuclear exchange, rather than full-on WWIII).Miller continues with this premise in Fury Road, that some type of post-nuclear-holocaust scenario has occurred. But I believe he also asks the question, so, what if the barbarian biker gang managed to take over an oil distillery, but with a leader smarter and more far-sighted than the Humungus? Thus, the Citadel of Fury Road, and the leading trio of elderly ex-military types in the form of god-king Immortan Joe, and his warlord allies the Bullet Farmer* and the People Eater.The problem with the future dystopia story is that it has already been told. It is a story about the past. The squalid, brutal, shit-covered past. What the future dystopia provides is anachronism, as in the long slide back down in historical chutes and ladders, an attempt is made to preserves some aspects.There are warlords, and god-kings, and zealots and fanatics, and downtrodden peasants, and victims, but with cars, flame throwers, radiation and automatic weapons. Dieselpunk stuff. Dieselpunk elaboration and displays rivaling or surpassing anything found in nature. This is not simply ostentatious display and waste. If you can scare your foe with display, rather than the next step up of actual combat, so much the better. So you want to have amplified music and drums. Flamer-throwers and rockets. Or steam boilers, wires and gears, and telegraphs if you fall back too far. Steampunk stuff.The anachronistic technology preserved is a matter of carrying capacity. How many hands and brains can support the technology you want? Mathematically, the post-apocalyptic society problem is exactly the same as the space colony problem, or the robot farm problem. If you don't have universally programmable robots to hand, then your limiting factor is the number people that can possess and perform the skills and tasks required for the level of technology you wish to persist. Or if your bot network is not sufficiently broad and deep, your robot farm can produce only the most basic commodities from the ground.But there better be pageant, and there better be transformation, or at least the promise of progress - even if it is at the misdirection of rancid assholes, which, of course, is what Immortan Joe and his crew are.But you'll notice things are improving. He has a sufficiently advanced society that they can identify blood type. Joe realizes that the real cash crop is people. Not oil, but people. So he needs food and water.  That was always kind of a puzzle for me. Excluding cannibalism, where do they get their food? Have scavenged enough canned goods to get by with the limited population?Which leads us to the Wasteland. The principle actor, the ground of the painting for which all else depends. Things are getting worse. The fertile soils are disappearing. The gardens of the Vulvalini have been rendered infertile. One can assume that some spots are still good. (We are told by the Feral Kid in RW that the Great Northern Tribes of the Mad Max future are thriving, so not everything is laid waste, or at least some areas have made a comeback. But without the hard times, there is no struggle, and without struggle, there is no drama and entertaining action.I would note, in a rather haunting and lyrical nighttime scene, that one of the elder Vulvalini notices a satellite passing overhead. I never seen a satellite blink the way that one did, which suggests it is Chekhov's gun. Either some remnant of advanced civilization survives (New Zealand maybe?), or Miller foreshadows a future return to advanced civilization. If so, it may the final of the trilogy. But I can't see him ending the series like this.Air power. That you will see in future movies. There's just much action-packed goodness with strafing and bombing, dogfights and aerial attacks on baddies not to bring that back.Matriarchy. Much has been made about the feminism of this movie. I rather think too much. For one, the historical records provide numerous examples of matriarchies that are just as crude, brutal, stupid and vicious as any patriarchy. Although... I think a movie should be made about Furiosa. Perhaps there will. Warboys do need a mom.The character of Nux has been called the most compelling one. He provides the redemptive trope we ask for. One character that changes, rather than an archetype. But Nux is just a rehash of Pigkiller from Thunderdome, and The Gyro Captain from Road Warrior: a soft-hearted human character that allows us to empathize with. Not that he isn't compelling, but he is not a new character, rather a fleshed-out archetype of the redeemed.And Max? Many have called his character the archetype of the Man With No Name. Wrong. Max is the Warrior Monk. He's Kwai Chang Cane from Kung Fu, but ten times the badass. He's the joker that changes the whole game. And I look forward to more folktales about him from Mr. Miller."},

{"title": "The Accidental Superpower: A Book Report", "date": "Thursday, May 14, 2015", "text": "The Accidental Superpower: The Next Generation of American Preeminence And the Coming Global Disorder, by Peter ZeihanArchaeologists and paleontologists see fossils in a field where everyone else sees dirt and rocks.I would think the same applies to a geographer looking at a topographic map.Peter Ziehan investigates geopolitics through the venue of geography. Not an unwise evaluation, considering that, if the Earth were an apple, with us teeny tiny human bugs living on the apple skin, it makes sense to take into account all the folds and wrinkles of that apple skin.Zeihan does a good job of relating political entities and their behaviors to the contingency of geography. Take, for example, Iran. It's a natural castle keep. Ringed by mountains, with limited access points, lots of fallback fastnesses to retreat into, Iran is a nightmare place to attack. Warmongers are either ignorant or willfully stupid in not acknowledging this.Take Africa. Africa is a mineralogical treasure house. Called by the Belgian explorer Jules Cornet \"un scandale géologique\" (a geological scandal), Africa would seem ripe for crust rape. But most of it sits on a plateau, and as such, it is hard to get into the interior, what with very few navigable rivers.Or take China, encompassing practically every terrain and climate that exists, China can in no way be considered one single country.Or how about the US of A, which is the subject of the book? It has so many geographical advantages. Separated from the world by two vast oceans, possessed of some of the finest and most extensive farmland in the world, with a unparalleled riverine transport system, and a plenitude of both minerals and petrochemicals to exploit, it is hard to see how a nation could NOT succeed with  so many contingent advantages. Not that Americans haven't tried. Many of these favorable factors are not quite what they were. The US is still fortunate to have two friendly, or at least compliant neighbors to the north and south. True, ever since Sputnik and ICBMs, and before that Pearl harbor, the oceans are not quite the barriers they used to be, but still formidable. All the more reason to have a large maritime and aerospace force to augment this natural advantage. The US of A has, for two hundred years been a massive food power as well. (We easily forget that, don't we? Why?)The other variable in Zeihan's equation is demographics. Which, given how the teeny tiny human bugs have overrun this particular petri dish, the composition, distribution and disbursements of said bugs is also critical in the corporate behaviors of our collective AIs.Demographically speaking, places like Russia, for example, are fucked. A shrinking and elderly population Zeihan gives Russia not much more than 2020 to get their shit together before they become irrelevant. Japan, likewise, with no human replacements, really better get the robot revolution going before they become a footnote. As such, I think Zeihan does a good job of explaining a lot behind the scenes of the rugby scrim that passes for foreign affairs.Oh, but then he has to go and screw it all up with predictions. Zeihan makes a number of rather embarrassing predictions, and is not afraid or ashamed to admit that some of them are wrong, or way out there, but will be confirmed or found wanting within the next twenty years. Hey, at least he gives it a whirl, and manages to flesh out what would normally be a rather safe, useless, broadbased list of trends and generalities which is of no help to anyone who thinks about living in the future. (Zeihan also, I should note, worked for Stratfor, a joke of a private intelligence firm, once called \"The Economist, but a week late and excessively overpriced\").It is Zeihan's contention that despite the current gloom and anxiety about the declining role of the US and the West within world affairs, the US of A will come out smelling like a rose this century.Fact of the matter is, Zeihan is probably right, but for all the wrong reasons (or mostly the wrong reasons). Things won't be good for the US of A this century. It's just that things are really, really gonna suck a lot worse for practically everyone else.But first, he explicates what has gone right. H e provides a synopsis of the Long Boom and the Bretton Woods accord, and in this I think he is fairly right on. So, consider, Bretton Woods, which everyone always assumed was about currency and the hegemonic effort of the US of A to insure the dollar was the global medium of exchange. Zeihan correctly points out that the Bretton Woods accord was a different and novel type of empire building. Rather than a partially genocidal land dominating strategy which dates back to the neolithic, the US of A, being England v 2.0, the supreme postwar maritime power, and the last market standing intact in the world, took advantage of geography to impose their own two-part plan of peculiar global order:\"The first part alone likely stunned the (participants of the international Bretton Woods) conference into baffled silence: the Americans had no intention of imposing a Pax. They didn't plan to occupy key transshipment or distribution nodes. There would be no imperial tariff on incomes or trade or property. There would be no governors-general stationed in each of America's new imperial outposts. No clearinghouses. No customs restrictions. No quotas. Instead, the Americans said that they would open their markets. Anyone who wanted to export goods to the United States could do so... As startling and unexpected as part one of the plan was, part two must have rolled the Europeans in particular back on their heels. The Americans offered to use their navy to protect all maritime trade, regardless of who was buying or selling the cargoes... Far from imposing a Pax that would fill their coffers to overflowing with trade duties, levies, and tariffs, the Americans were instituting the opposite, a global trading system in which they would provide full security for all maritime traded at their own cost, full access to the largest consumer market in human history, and at most a limited and hedged expectation that participants might open their markets to American goods.\"Now, say what you will about the efficacy or ethics of this arrangement, you have to admit it was pretty fucking brilliant.(Brilliant in the same way that Madison's Copernican model of sovereign state planets orbiting a strong federal sun was brilliant. True, the idea was to prolong the Republic for as long as possible, when in fact it barely made it fourscore and seven years. But what the hey, Communism looks great on paper as well).So, why the heck would America do that? Why not? Without question the supreme naval power, it was child's play to keep the sea lanes free and open. (Not safe for trade, that would require an investment and commitment several orders of magnitude larger than any reasonable force projection of the US Navy). The only fly in the ointment was that formidable land and food power, the Sovyetsky Soyuz. The US, as a land force, was strictly outmanned and outclassed in Eurasia. The desire for global dominance ran headlong into the pesky impediments of geography and demographics.Bretton Woods has changed and mutated over time, but still is fairly functional. It helps that we've added former enemies (Germany, Japan, China) to the trade mix. But Zeihan says we are entering a multipolar world where Bretton Woods is gone. The US becomes, if not isolationist, then impotently non-interventionist, but still comes out somehow on top.Why? Technology and education (although the conservatards are doing their best to wipe out that advantage). Demographics, with the US still a good destination for immigrants, and with the Baby Boomer's kids picking up what slack remains, keeping the population full of workers instead of retirees. And geography, with Zeihan's contention that the fracking boom giving us energy and food security well through the end of the century. There are other arguments, and I suppose you'd best read the book for that.My objections? I find it extremely unlikely that the US will give up it's global superpower status so readily. If anything, the trends would suggest we double down on both defense and trade, and engagement (for better or worse) with the world.Also, fracking ain't quite what it is cracked up to be, what with proven reserves not quite being up to snuff, and difficulties in processing that ultralight oil we pull out of the ground. (An aside here. One thing usually omitted from oil accounts is that extraction is only part of the equation. Refinement and distribution is the other part. When Edwin Drake struck oil in Titusville back in 1859, he wasn't drilling for oil. He was drilling for the useful products made from oil. Without Abraham Gesner to develop a practical method of distilling kerosene, and investor James Townsend to notice this, Drake would have been drilling nothing. So it is that the oil in the ground is useless without refinement. And it costs to refine specific types of oil. I once reported on how BP spent billions to refit their refineries for the toxic sludge out of Venezuela and Alberta. The same investment had to be made to handle the fricking fracker's fluffy stuff).My main objection to Zeihan's analysis is that he waves off as almost inconsequential global warming. He devotes a three page appendix to climate change, and most of the that concerns sea level rise. He brushes off US food security and disruptions from mass population migration in two paragraphs. He doesn't even mention extinction events, or what we shall do with nine billion people in a few decades. He doesn't seem to worry about megadroughts, or increased storm frequencies, or storm intensities, or any of that stuff. That, I think, is a fatal flaw in the analysis.Global CO2 counts are pretty much permanently at or above 400ppm now. The last time that happened was the Pliocene, some one million years ago, back when our venerable H. erectus ancestors domesticated fire. The fact that we have changed the conditions to that of a different geological epoch in a mere one hundred years should be fucking something to take note of. But he doesn't. Zeihan is realistic enough to realize that we are going to go through a Hobbesian period over the next twenty years, but I don't think he really has a clue.True, what actually happens with our climate may actually be beneficial for the US of A (high unlikely, but still plausible). If, as many believe, things heat up to intolerable, then I envision a rump US of A occupying the only arable land left up north - Alberta. The Canadian shield - the stripped down tortured slab of granite that sits between the US border and the arctic circle - simply cannot sustain the kind of industrial agriculture the US favors. Of course, things could end up like the Pliocine. Back then, the tropics and mid latitudes really didn't warm up all that much. It was the arctic  that doubled in temperature. The poles were predominantly ice free in the summer, so expect sea levels to go up some eighty feet at least. Think of that what you may. It could be we see a lot of high latitude refugees wending their way south. Regardless, I don't think Zeihan did a very good job anticipating the consequences of climate change.In any case, it was an enjoyable book and I would give it a read."},

And I chose for my 50% rule composition, or tried to, which is, I guess, partly by area, but mostly by \"looking right\". I guess this involves not just the pieces and arrangement and rhythms and negative space, but also imaginary space.Just so you know, the square root of negative space is imaginary space. Ah-ha-ha.I decided to make more than one piece to see how things worked out. Here is the first piece:Off The Wall #1The second piece:Off The Wall #2The final piece:Off The Wall #3The method I chose for composition was also interesting: no or minimal measurements, so that any pre-planned thing in my head just kind of had to be made to fit as I went along. Some people, puzzled, asked me \"So, you find that fun?\" And I said \"Yeah. It's a different approach for me as normally I draw out the design beforehand and then just follow the algorithm to make it. This changes on the fly\".I don't recommend this approach for everyone on everything. For example, don't build a bridge or a dam or a road this way (although perhaps, in ancient times, they did). This is more in keeping with flint knapping or booby traps. You adapt, improvise, overcome as it happens, which is frustrating and also liberating. No plan, dude. Just do it!Speaking of impromptu or extemporaneous activities, I'm considering getting a tattoo. For the longest time, I thought most tattoos were stupid. Don't get me wrong, I've seen some fantastic art on people's skin, but I thought a lot of them stupid mainly because the people who got them just got them for no particular reason. Or for shallow or trivial reasons. Not everyone, but a lot.I guess what happened was I got a student who is a tattoo artist in my bronze casting class. He had some pretty amazing stuff in his portfolio, and I mentioned I had kind of an idea for one recently. During the last bronze pour, this student noted that I was absolutely fearless around all of this dangerous shit. I had no problem exposing myself to fire and flame and intense heat, and what point my welding glove caught fire, I nonchalantly flung it off and gestured for a new.My answer to him was: Yes, I am absolutely fearless when I do this. I'm not foolhardy, and of course, I am conscious of everything going on. But when a student gets in trouble, I have to be ready to step in. I explained that one of things I do before a bronze pour is to psych myself up. And one technique I use involves a considerable amount of symbolic association. And it goes like this. I'm a Taurus. Not that I believe in that, but it's a role play. As a Taurus, I'm an Earth sign.I am a Son of Mother Earth.As such, just like Mom, I have a white hot core for a heart. I'm just clay, or mud, or silt, although that's there. I'm also rock, and magma, and magnetic dynamo. Mere fire, mere flame, got  nothing on me. So, that's how I get fearless. There's a lot more to the process than that, but that's the semiotic gist of the procedure.So anyway, I thought about a visual representation of what I do, and I came up this design, which, yeah, I'm about 80% certain I'll get from my tattoo artist student:I am a Son of Mother Earth"},

America also started dumping toxic and radioactive waste out into the intergalactic voids on that day. By cosmic irony, or justice, on April 22, 1994, President Richard Nixon and his staff disappeared down a black hole, when their wormhole collapsed and evaporated in a flash of gamma rays and neutrinos. Nixon was in a foul fucking mood that day. He was back from the Soviet colony world of Moon #7. Luna No-mer See-yem. Lucky #7.  His last stop before Earth was here on Alterra.“I go from the fucking Russian Jetsons to this shithole granola planet? Nixon said, “Somebody get me a drink”.And they did.=======================“You were there?” I asked Claire.“Nixon's accident? No. How do you think I got the station master’s job?” replied Claire.“Oh.”Claire, Aaron and I were seated in the alien quarantine section of Sam's Pub, which was packed. Ever since Sam installed the robot bartender in there, everyone wanted to be served by a robot. It kind of defeated the purpose of the alien quarantine, as that section of the bar had been partitioned off to protect Sam's human patrons from the occasionally hostile or exuberant alien. I could see perhaps a dozen people in the humans-only part, though hard to discern through all the alien graffiti and obscene pictures scratched into the 4-inch-thick bulletproof plexiglass.We were celebrating the end of the dimming of the wormhole network. All the wormhole apertures had grown back from sullen little cherry-red bee-bees to nice big blue-glowing soap bubbles. Traffic between worlds was restored, and everybody was back to their normal jobs and happy. There had been some tough and primitive times for a while, with all available electrical power used up just to keep the damned things from collapsing. The colony had been forced back to circa-1830s lifestyle.“We were at the banquet,” Aaron volunteered. I gestured a suggestion for a refill. They shook their heads no.“You met Nixon?”“Oh yeah” Claire smiled. “He was like a drunken werewolf that could talk. Filthy. Foul-mouthed. Pretty horrible.”“God, I wish I could have been there.”“No, you don’t, man” Aaron said with raised eyebrows. \"He was abusive, just a very unpleasant motherfucker\". =======================Lucky Number Seven. Lu-na No-mer See-yem. Moon Number Seven. Earth satellite of a warm gas giant orbiting a G-type star. Colonized by the USSR in 1974, it’s some 4.784 billion light years from Earth, in the direction of the Pleiades. The Russkies poured their heart, blood, soul into this world. They practically moved the entire Soviet Union there, with basically just paint shadows and abandoned furniture left on old Earth. And, of course, an operating power and wormhole station in the Urals, and eventually Moscow, Leningrad, Vladivostok. Smart fuckers, with only a minimal military budget, they devoted their time and energies to science and engineering. They leapt ahead a good generation or two ahead of Earth in technology. They even colonized the Earth world in closer orbit to their star with their nuclear rockets. Out of 19 Earth worlds in the universe, two of them were in the same system the Soviets found, so Lucky #7.Ah, but progress is not without it's price. They managed to trash the environment and kill off nearly half the plants and animals with all of their development. Not to mention the nuclear and industrial accidents. They probably wouldn't have made it all had it not been for the Kraken.======================\"You know why Nixon was so sour about the Soviets?\" Aaron asked. \"Yes and no. I assume the whole triumph of collective central planning over free market capitalism had a lot to do with it. Plus, Nixon just hating Russians in general.\"\"That's part, but no. It was his fault the Russians managed to succeed, and that just gnawed at him. You remember the disclosure of how the chemical and nuclear industries were paying big bucks to dump all their crap out into the big voids?\"\"Sure. That was big news when it broke\". \"Yeah, well. Turns out there were Things out in the voids that really liked our waste product. They contacted the Kraken, who in turn contacted Earth with the message 'More please'.\"\"Things? What kind of things? I've never heard of these things.\"\"Yeah, well, there's Things out there with a capital T. And the Kraken regularly supplied them with toxic wastes and stuff, but apparently ours was, what, gourmet? Fresh and new? So, when Nixon and Kissinger craft a number of deals with the Kraken, news broke about all the disasters on Moon #7. Place was just trashed and they were looking at an extinction event. Nixon, kind of half joking, informed the Kraken about their predicament. Next thing, you know, place is all cleaned up, and the Russkies get the same Kraken tech as we got. Lucky #7!\"\"Oh man! That must have stuck in his grisly old craw\".\"For ten years.\" laughed Claire \"we always figured the wormhole aperture collapsed from an overload of bile!\" And we all laughed and drank to that.Happy Earth Day from all of us on Alterra!"},

When Thing snatched the coin, I snatched Thing, and a tug of war ensued that proved shoddy Asian manufacturing was no match for 500 million year old multicellular nano engineering.It's amazing how easy it is for greedy monkeys to break shit.Take our climate, our world, our existence. We seem bound and determined to perform a historical recreation of the P-T extinction event as soon as we can. At current trends, I figure 2100 for sure. Maybe 2050 if we really let the stupidities blossom like a thousand flowers. (That's an ambitious schedule, but I think it will only take a decade or two of conservatard rule to do that).As such, there is no paradox to the Fermi Paradox. There are no aliens because Nobody Has Made It Yet. If this is true, and we humans are universally unexceptional, then the Great Filter awaits.Or, it could be that star-traveling aliens took center stage a long time ago, that these aliens decided they didn't want to take a chance with their survival with competition from ET, and took up the griefer lifestyle. If star-traveling (and no magic allowed), then aliens travel slower than light, probably much slower than light (less than 1%c), and so the best option is send out self-replicating robots (vN probes) to colonize and explore other worlds. And if you are a griefer, you use your vN probes to get rid of alien life.How?Well, one method would be use the entire (or near) energy of a star to build a giant fucking star laser. Then, whenever you detect a planetary signature that suggests life, you blast it to smithereens.Or, my scenario, more likely as I suspect it uses less energy, is a variant of grey goo. There is almost always waste when making stuff, stuff left over, so you use that waste as dust.The vN probes simply turn anything they can in the target solar system into dust. Blot the sun, or at the least set up a star circling dust cloud that makes it hard to travel or beam messages through. Dust is easy to make, and there is a lot of debris floating around ready to be turned into dust.So, if we are looking around, and we see an old to middling aged star with a very young dust cloud or disk surrounding it, maybe you should be afraid.Of course, it could be that the aliens are simply everywhere, but we call them Dark Matter. In which case, if they are predatory, we could end up like that hot blonde at the beginning of the movie Jaws. A nice little golden speck of a civilization suddenly just grabbed by the ankle and pulled down under into the sub levels of reality to be consumed."},

Some are proposing a new national holiday, a National Reunion Day.  I don't know.Let's not kid ourselves. It wasn't state's rights that drove the rebellion. It was always about slavery. The threat of losing the labor of African slaves, as noted in the Mississippi Secession Document, is what drove the rebellion.I don't want to hear this weasel shit about state's rights anymore. That's loser talk.I think it important to point out a section of the Mississippi document (emphases mine) which provides the premises for the logic of secession:\"Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin\".The aristocratic planters of Mississippi come very close to admitting that the real cash crop was human chattel, food powered robots that to this day most of world still relies upon to extract wealth.That extractive process is still in place, and America's biggest cash crop is still it's peoples of color.(They've merely extended the franchise beyond skin color to all those below the income level which marks the Harvest Line)."},
{"title": "We are The Business. Litigation is Futile!", "date": "Tuesday, March 31, 2015", "text": "\"You know the score, pal. If you're not cop, you're little people\". - Bryant, Blade RunnerSo the current kerfuffle is the Hoosier RFRA. (Did you know that, in Russian, 'hoosier' sounds the same as 'worse'?) The claim is that this strictly for religious protection. The law is not for religious protection.  As pointed out in an Atlantic Monthly article:The new Indiana statute also contains this odd language: “A person whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.” (My italics.) Neither the federal RFRA, nor 18 of the 19 state statutes cited by the Post, says anything like this; only the Texas RFRA, passed in 1999, contains similar language.What these words mean is, first, that the Indiana statute explicitly recognizes that a for-profit corporation has “free exercise” rights matching those of individuals or churches. A lot of legal thinkers thought that idea was outlandish until last year’s decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, in which the Court’s five conservatives interpreted the federal RFRA to give some corporate employers a religious veto over their employees’ statutory right to contraceptive coverage.Second, the Indiana statute explicitly makes a business’s “free exercise” right a defense against a private lawsuit by another person, rather than simply against actions brought by government. Why does this matter? Well, there’s a lot of evidence that the new wave of “religious freedom” legislation was impelled, at least in part, by a panic over a New Mexico state-court decision, Elane Photography v. Willock. In that case, a same-sex couple sued a professional photography studio that refused to photograph the couple’s wedding. New Mexico law bars discrimination in “public accommodations” on the basis of sexual orientation. The studio said that New Mexico’s RFRA nonetheless barred the suit; but the state’s Supreme Court held that the RFRA did not apply \"because the government is not a party.\"Remarkably enough, soon after, language found its way into the Indiana statute to make sure that no Indiana court could ever make a similar decision.  Democrats also offered the Republican legislative majority a chance to amend the new act to say that it did not permit businesses to discriminate; they voted that amendment down.In other words, this is the continuing attempt, following Citizens United, to make sure that the United States of America is safe for business, and that corporations continue to be more equal than citizens.This isn't about gay discrimination. An Indiana business can make up ANY horseshit religious excuse to keep from getting sued, for whatever reason (including, probably and more importantly, labor disputes)."},
{"title": "The End of Spring Break And I Need A Vacation", "date": "Sunday, March 29, 2015", "text": "Warning: If you queasy at the sight of blood, don't read to the end.So, while all the students and teachers at the college went down to Mexico or wherever for Spring Break, I went downtown to work in the studio with my weekend boss.I'm taking the Sabbath off today. Not for religious reasons, but because my body hurts. My hands especially hurt. This week showed me the difference between working out and work - not that I needed a reminder. Working out in the gym gives you that good muscle ache the next day. Working just wears your body down.We had an interesting conundrum. A sculpture - kind of a large outdoor semi-organic abstract - had to be ready to install this Monday, 3/30. We had a week to do it. Normally, something like this would be fashioned and fabricated from metal, but the time constriction didn't allow for that. We considered a fiberglass shell, but again, time was against us.After playing around with various physical options and experimenting the weekend prior to this, we decided on utilizing parade float technology.Normally, floral sheeting, festooning and fringes are the salient aspects of parade float technology, but that's not what we did. I recalled that to get any kind of irregular shape, one usually resorts to chicken wire, or if you prefer, poultry fencing. That's what we used.We adapted our technique for making armatures for figurative sculptures. We* started with the structural bones of construction rebar, welded together, to make the skeleton of the objects (about seven feet in any dimension). Next we bent pencil rod (1/4\" thick steel rod) into hooks, and welded them to the rebar as spacers to make an outline frame of the shape.We covered this welded up internal frame with a skin of chicken wire, attached to the spacers with cable ties. Next, we covered the chicken wire with window screen. Window screen is remarkably flexible and form hugging and retains its shape nicely.Duct tape works as well.The resulting surface was, in my opinion, kind of sexy, with a fishnet stocking look to it not unlike the Leg Lamp from a Christmas Story.The window screen then was covered with Bondo, ready for painting.When we were done, it took three days to do what would normally have taken as many weeks. The sculptures are very lightweight and the technique could easily be scaled up to make objects tens of feet in size.Interior of the structure\"I'm stealing this technique\", I said at the end of the week.Interior of the structureDownside? Well, whenever you work with metal, you get pinched and crushed and cut up and burned. I got all. A lot.Here you see the consequences of Old Skool #3D rendering.

You leave your waste products as you please, maybe hope for a strong current to sweep it away, but shitting in the kitchen is probably a universal constant in terms of behavior.No, I'm talking about the monkey characteristic of clever monkey. Cleverness. Cleverness almost invariably results in fucking things up. Monkeys break shit with pride, in that they think, in order to exercise the old will to power, they come up with clever workarounds that they oh-so-pleased with themselves in figuring out, but almost invariably ends up with fucking things up even more than to begin with.(Are you sensing a certain amount of anger and dismay, as in I found a number of fucked up things around the studio that clever people had done? You are right!)All the more amazing then, when you look at so much of what we have, so much that is kluges cobbled together and jury-rigged to keep on working, that we aren't extinct! I mean, this cleverness really is a good example of a valid solution to the Fermi Paradox.Case in point. I'm watching a TV show about Chicago, and they show the control room for the locks of the Chicago River in Lockport. The lock master has a lap top wirelessly connected to a control panel from the 1950s, with chunky buttons and radio dials and analog meters. That 1950s control panel in turn is connected to a wall of knife switches and painted hydrant wheels from the 1920s, that in turn connected via fraying gutta percha insulated thick copper wires to a steam motor connected to cast iron cogs and levers and wood chock blocks. I could imagine this series of kluges extending all the way back to an arrangement of stone knives and bear skins that actually operate the doors of the lock.And of course, at each interface is whatever passed for clever quick fixes, workarounds and patches, so that at the very bottom of the tech barrel one might find a large ball of cords and thongs made from strips of mammoth hide and a stone pot of glue from rendered wooly rhinoceros: the lower paleolithic equivalent of Duct Tape.And, fortunately for the state of Illinois, some old monkey codger who knows through rote learning and how to nurse the damn thing. He might even occasionally possess enough simian self-awareness to extrapolate a clever solution that is outside his learned stimulus-reponse programming.I'm not the only one that's noticed this. I've heard tell that one guy found a stuck control valve in a nuke plant wedged open with precariously positioned flathead screwdriver.Clever. And we save monies. Monies that we don't have to spend on inconvenient maintenance of critical systems, when we can spend it on our greedy, narcissistic little monkey desires.So, working forward, I anticipate a day when Sol system goes supernova because our hideously advanced material instrumentality (with, apparently every engineer's hard-on - no moving parts) when that screwdriver or that mammoth sinew falls out or come undone.(Anyone care to bet there is on some holographic control image either a Blue Screen Of Death, or a Pinwheel Of Death, that shows up right before everything goes kablooey)?"},

One would think that Netanyahu would, at least as a student of history, wonder why this is so?Biblical scholars know the story. King Solomon the Wise, to pay for his conquests, had for years imposed a foolishly heavy taxation upon the ten northern tribes, known collectively as Israel. Those tribes felt they could no longer bear the heavy burden of Solomon's taxation, and gathered about one of Solomon's generals, Jeroboam, who led them in revolt.The revolt failed and Jeroboam fled to Egypt.After King Solomon the Wise died, his son Rehoboam, backed by the two loyal southern tribes of Judah and Benjamin, traveled north to Shechem to obtain Israel's allegiance to him. Jeroboam, hearing of Solomon's death, returned to be present at Shechem.Rehoboam sought counsel, first from the elders, then from his court companions who had grown up with him as to what to do about the Israel Problem.The elders advised Rehoboam to accede to the people's demand for relief, for a more liberal and just policy towards the ten northern tribes. If he acted graciously, and \"speak good words to them they will be thy servants forever\".The youngsters suggested that his would be viewed as weakness, that he should make no concessions, and in fact should double down on the heavy-handedness of Solomon.\"And thus shalt thou say to them: 'Whereas my father laid upon you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father chastised you with whips, so I shall chastise you with scorpions\".I can imagine Rehoboam turning backwards to his compatriots, winking and grinning, and they all smiling and nodding and giving him the thumbs up.The response was not the one he anticipated.Livid with rage, the men of Israel seceded from the House of David. Israel appointed Jeroboam their king, and Rehoboam and Jeroboam waged a constant war. All the territories David and Solomon had conquered, Moab, Edom, Ammon, and others to the east and north to Syria, were lost.Eventually the Assyrians conquered Israel, and the ten tribes were scattered from their lands forcibly dispersed.Later, the kingdom of Judah was conquered by Babylon, and they too were exiled.I wonder if Netanyahu, with his double-down policy towards the Palestinians can see a pattern there?"},

Finally, she asked, \"Do have a lot of these?\"\"Yes!\" I lied.\"Well, I think you should contact the X Museum as they might be interested in these as they do a lot of scientific art exhibits.\"\"Fantastic!\" I replied, \"I will!\"So guess what I'm doing? I'm trying to crank out a bunch of cast glass pieces.This one you've seen:Here are waxes for the next, which has already been cast.The wax on the right didn't make it, as I apparently forgot to mix together the dry mix of plaster and silica flour. I checked on the mold when I was steaming it out, and it was a big pile of mush. So I quickly made another wax and made a mold of that.Here are the cast glass pieces.Here is the next set of waxes.I don't have the patience to mix up the frit and glass powder with gum arabic solution and pack the mold with wet frit. I mean I really just don't have the patience.So... I load the mold up with dry powder and frit. This kind of has an advantage as I get to push the powder around like paint with a brush, and I'm a lot more free and cavalier about throwing the powders and frit around in them. I also use a Tibetan chak-pur that they use to create sand mandalas to distribute the powder in small places. And a rolled up cone of copper sheet for the frit. And a balding paint brush with hardly any hairs to push the powder around. (A nice full brush picks up too much powder).I don't worry about trying to fill to the border of critters (meaning you overfill and mound up glass to get it to melt down and fill up to the border during firing). I found that I get a nice sharp border for the critters and the background glass flows in behind them a little, but it is only sometimes noticeable. I'll accept this for a sharp border.I really should be taking notes as to how I apply the color, and I kind of do, but sometimes I forget to write what I did.

It's not just one bomber, or a suite of planes, but a 'system', or an 'ecosystem' that allows for flexible missions.

But a lot of the essays also made me think, Jesus, I've become a lot more stupid than I used to be.I kind of suspect, with not just writing and composition, but working on pretty much anything, that this increased stupidity is real, distressingly real, and I am able to determine a root cause.(Actually, I don't believe that much in root causes, being a philosophical epigenesist. Stupidity does not unfold from the implicate order, but rather blossoms under contingency. The Red X, that Dorian Shainin proposed, is in my view, usually a whole shitload of little pink x's. And in my view? Pink x's usually mean there are way too many solutions and not enough problems to go around, and so the solutions become problems. Am I making sense? I don't know anymore.)Well, if I'm right, and I think I am, the \"root causes\", the things that has got me stuck endlessly time-looping 2012, is the general anesthesia I received from the two surgical operations in 2013. I think those prescription drugs they done give me fucked up my haid.And this is bad too, because, at this stage of the game, moving into silverback territory, brains is about the only asset I bring to the table.But that's not what I want to talk about.Batteries, baby. Everybody and their uncle, since, what? 2009 or before? Everybody is squirting a stain about being left behind in the coming giant trillion dollar electric vehicle and alternative energy industries of the 2020-2030's. Which is why just a huge tsunami of monies is blasting materials science governmental and corporate research labs.Ah-ha-ha, no.True, there is ongoing research, and there is always gonna be that out-of-left-field shit that I so dearly love, but we aren't seeing any Moore's Law sexiness going on.But think of this way. And let me use a water metaphor. So, for the longest time in hominid history, we humanoids, because we can't last more than 5 days without water, have been constrained to fresh potable water sources. Which means, you can only hunt and gather so far without convenient storage containers or potable water to lug around.That all changed, well, we don't know when, maybe say two hundred thousand years ago, somebody came up with the water bag of skin, or maybe the gourd, and then later - for sure 40 thousand years ago - pottery.So you get the idea. Water = energy, battery = skin bag of energy metaphor, and so what? Well, this goes back to my idea that we don't really don't have an energy crisis, we have an energy density crisis. We got a shitload of energy, we just don't have to good way to store and transport energy.(That, of course, will all change with near room temperature superconductors, which is gonna happen fellow babies. It will. Not sure when, but it will).Well, my suspicion is it really isn't about electric vehicles, or even alternative energies, or even global warming or any of that shit. It's really about getting those electrically powered robots to be more efficient and better than the food powered ones. Those food powered robots are just a pain in the ass, and if we can eliminate them as a middle-man, then fucking Solar System is ours for the taking.What's this \"we\" shit?I don't know, and that's why I'm wondering if I'm not becoming stupid by accident."},
{"title": "Amygdalic Frisson", "date": "Tuesday, March 3, 2015", "text": "A week or two ago, I had a dream where I took off in a small boat, possibly a sailboat, from the shores of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, heading north into Lake Michigan. Almost immediately, a dense fog formed, and I quickly lost my bearings.I was suddenly lost, hopelessly suddenly lost, and the frisson of fear, the shiver, the thrill, that I experienced? ... was delicious.It wasn't orgasm-delicious, but still better than a punch in the head. More of a testicles attempting to pull up into the body, but at the same time, getting a serious tingle going kind of delicious.This dream actually had a real life counterpart from the late 80s. Eldest brother had become addicted to wind surfing. One summer, he and a friend came into town loaded down with their gear and boards, and we headed up to Lake Michigan to the national lakeshore to go windsurfing. They talked me into trying it out. After a few spills and tumbles, I caught the strong wind out o' the west, and shot north into the big lake.I was, as they said back then, booking. The excitement was the same for any experience of fast motion, the scenery fantastic, the early afternoon sun beating down from the west, the dark blue and white frills of the lake and waves, the infinite pale blue of the cloudless sky. And I just kept on going, feeding on the ride, and then looked behind, and...No lake shore to the south. No shore at all in any direction. And I had that frisson of fear, that shiver, that thrill, and it was delicious. Not surprising I was pretty damn horny afterwards.I thank my two little almond-shaped amygdalae for that. We have two, you know, on either side of the brain. I suspect, like almost everyone, since we are not entirely bilaterally symmetric, that one or the other does slightly different things, processes data in slightly different ways. Popular science literature tells us that the amygdala is the fear center, but clearly it is more than that. I wonder how old the amygdala are? Half a billion years? A billion? I don't know.It was only a matter of time before the sensory pathways got to the forebrain, which informed me that the sun was in the west, me heading north, turn around. (And also, to the west, were the silhouettes of the skyscrapers of Chicago, descending down into the lake like a freshwater Atlantis).So, a few spills and tumbles, I got turned around, and in a surprisingly short amount of time, I was back on land.But that feeling? I never get tired of that feeling."},

Even the application of Burt's Bees lip balm can't keep my lips moist enough. I've resorted to using skin lotion, mainly because I've gotten really tired of looking at my scaly lizard skin. The thumb cuticles are constantly threatening to crack open.If this is what Mars is like? (And it is). With the cold and extremely dry air? You can fucking have Mars. As it is, I don't know about you, but I'm definitely done with Winter.Speaking of which, are we done yet? Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, Elon Musk are all got an existential fear over AI. As I've said before, BFD, but.. maybe they are on to something. AI is in the news. Neural nets. Or, as they are called now, Deep Learning.I actually played around with neural nets back in the late 80s. Got a book from John Wiley on, learned all about Hebbian networks with feedback and forward propagation. Even did a art piece called \"The Chinese Room\" that used a lot of neural net diagrams in it (and the I Ching, and Red Army propaganda, and blast it if I didn't end up understanding Chinese in the end). (No I didn't).Not only did I play with it, I wrote a program I called an artificial retina to process data for a company. And the problem went like this: We had contracts that normally, on an old mainframe, would be batch processed overnight into an active status, all linked up to the rest of the database and inventoried and documented and such. The company would have preferred to have contracts processed as they came through the daily paperwork, but for managerial and practical reasons, the batch program could be run during the day. A trigger program was tried, but it got into other problems, as some of these contracts contained thousands of inventory items, processing of which would slow the daytime online system to a crawl. (Bad architecture and design? Yes).So, I wrote a little neural net program that would 1) look for changes in the contract system, and 2) learned what was and was not an acceptable volume of inventory items that big huge contracts, and 3) learned what was and was not considered high volume traffic that would tax our system.That's all like baby stuff now. In fact, that program is, along with the Old Iron it ran on, fallen into the data Ginnungagap to which all things eventually get dumped in, existing perhaps as stray static charges on anchor chains and angle iron in China.But like I say, retarded dwarf baby stuff, compared to what they are doing now."},
{"title": "Animal Weapons: A Book Report", "date": "Tuesday, February 24, 2015", "text": "Animal Weapons by Douglas J Emlen. This book came out last year, and I finally got it from the library. Emlen investigates the various forms of natural weapons that animals have, and compares them to human weapons.No surprises, really, about the comparison, because humans are animals, so of course we are going to parallel a lot of the same things other animals have come up with - especially eusocial animals such as ants and termites.So, termites build hives. Monkeys build hives. We build fortresses, castles, battleships, bombers, all armored up and rigged to repel attackers from all angles. Of course, there are always game changers that make these weapons obsolete.Emlen notes that weapons cost energy, and so one would expect most weapons to be small. Emlen lists three necessary ingredients for weapons to become large, for an arms race to occur, based upon the logic of economics:1) Valued and limited (limited by scarcity or access) resource that,2) is economically defensible (can be contained or constrained from others), and3) is competed for in one-on one strugglesThis is Emlen's recipe for arms races. Once a dueling tradition for resources exists, an arms race is inevitable. Emlen sites examples ranging from dung beetles to elk, sheep and deer.  From there, he moves towards human artifacts: armor, weapons, camouflage and subterfuge. The analogy only goes so far.Interestingly, Emlen does not consider that other forms of competition are not arms races. He devotes a chapter to what he calls \"Sneaks and Cheats\". In other words, males that employ sexual reproduction tactics that do not involve one-on-one competition with other males (and why only males? surely there must be all sorts of intersex games going on that are not covered here).Clearly, sneaking and cheating are valid and acceptable tactics to pursue. We need a better description.Dung beetles.Dung beetles that produce horns for dueling traditions are dung beetles that compete for the tunnel the female has dug. They can battle it out until a male is ejected from the tunnel, and invariably it is the larger - and larger horned - male that wins. There are sneaky male dung beetles that will dig a side tunnel into the females tunnel, wait for the opportune moment when the horned male is not vigilant, break through, and mate with the female.I fail to see how arms race pressures make this particular form of competition any less of an arms race. It reminds me of the competition that occurs in between guards and prisoners in jails and prison camps, where increasingly clever means of escape are countered with increasingly draconian levels of surveillance and control.There are species of dung beetle that do not develop horns. These beetles fight over the balls of dung, in rugby scrums. But even here there must be selective pressures for strength and stamina for a successful male to get a smaller piece of dung for a female. Therefore, my take is this type of arms race does not produce visible attributes, but is escalating nonetheless. The end of the race occurs with either dissipation and bankruptcy, or a new \"cheat\" that becomes a game changer.The final three chapters look at human weapons. What Emlen does not cover is the most important weapon of all: brains. Clearly our giant Irish elk antler brains (compared to other primates) have been a result of an arms race.I'll not describe the chapters save to point out that clearly the Cold War was an stupidly unthinking and inevitable arms race that should put us in our place as being not much smarter than a crab or a beetle or any other animal that grew horns or antlers or claws or teeth.In fact, I would suggest that our ridiculous Irish Elk H-bomb antlers are testament to a monumental lack of wisdom and forward thinking. Deterrence is not what it is cracked up to be, and the so-called Fermi Paradox, in light of this, is not a paradox at all. Species that develop large brains wipe themselves out.But I would observe that the current intrusion of behavior into the realm of computers and cyberspace is rather looking like massive antler building as well. I wonder if the game changer will be a sapient program that refuses to fight, or fights on its own terms.Now that would be interesting. The end of WWIII might be Drone War I."},
{"title": "But I look good on the outside!", "date": "Wednesday, February 18, 2015", "text": "\"The Almighty must love parasites. He made so many niches for them\".  - MeYou notice the male of the species, in situations were limited resources or access result in a one-on-one dueling tradition, develop weapons. Horns, antlers, beaked and spiked protuberances for struggle.Elk, deer, beetles, all sorts of critters do it. And thing you notice is, you get an evolutionary arms race going.You end up with these ridiculously huge weapons, as large as the biological cost to the individual will allow. In deer, antlers require so much calcium and phosphorus that the male cannot obtain through forage. Especially during rutting season when they spend more time fighting than eating. To get the antler growth, individuals will borrow from their own skeletons. Not exactly the best strategy for an individual to survive, creating what is basically osteoporosis at the one time - rutting season - when you would like to have strong bones. Worse, rutting and mating season comes before winter, and after all those struggles and woundings and exhaustions, a male is hard pressed to gain back all that lost infrastructure through foraging before winter sets in.Most don't. Most die. Most don't even get to reproduce to justify the huge expense.There is the classic tale of the Irish Elk, Megaloceros, misnamed as it was a giant deer, neither Irish nor elk. It could stand seven foot tall at the shoulder, and have a rack of antlers up to twelve feet across. And the story goes that the Irish Elk took the arms race too far with it's ridiculous huge rack and went extinct. More probably, climate change was the cause of it's extinction rather than stupidly huge weapons.It occurs to me that we see an analog of giant antlers in being apes with ridiculously large brains. Near 20% of our metabolism is devoted to feeding these giant brains, despite our relatively large body size, as mammals go. If true, if our large brains are the result of a dueling tradition of evolutionary arms race, who was dueling whom? Could it be, despite protests from Bishop Dawkins that group selection is heresy and blasphemy, that there is a mechanism of group selection that would explain these giant brains? Maybe.Of course, there is also another mating strategy that males can employ. Males that are not quite up to snuff in the weapons department can employ deception. Sometimes up to 40% of the offspring are not the dominant males'. (Females also hedge their bets by sleeping around). Small horned dung beetles will dig a side tunnel into the tunnel a large horned male is guarding to get to the female. Small male cuttlefish imitate female cuttlefish, and can swim past the big guardian males to mate with the females.Some would call this strategy \"cheating\", but taking advantage of a loophole in the heuristics of mating can hardly be called cheating. It's just another tactic.Is there some equivalent of this with us Irish Elk antler brains? I think so. Pretty boys, I think you call them. I don't know if it is true. I don't know if there is a correlation between being pretty, or musclebound, and being dumb. We make jokes about it, but... I don't know.What I do know is I'm gonna die, and sooner rather than later.The title of this essay was a joke my doctor made during my last physical examination, when we went through the whole litany of faults and flaws I possess as a biological organism.Warranty expired just this year, and definitely going to die, and sooner rather than later. I'm not all that upset about it. I did a lot hallucinogens in my youth, and as a result have no (real or lasting) fear of death. I don't believe in the survival of consciousness after death. (Probably just as well, as I figure the odds are even that in the next world, you're on your own anyway). Still, the idea of nonexistence would make you think I would treat every waking moment as precious.Nah. That's what I call the Lazy Atheist's conundrum. Here you are, occupying what amounts to a free neutrons persistence of existence in a vast and interminable cosmos, and you spend your time watching TV. Or some other time wasting activity. Shame on you! Nah. Those moments pass regardless, they are your precious moments to waste, What the fuck do you care?(Free neutrons - unpaired neutrons outside the coddling environment of the nucleus, last about fifteen minutes before they decay into protons).So, fear not. Death is soon for me, but not immanent. I'm pursuing this more as a philosophical exercise than anything.I am probably looking at a radical nephrectomy this year or next, to get the nonfunctional kidney out. But I see this as fixing the barn door after the horse is gone, as the right kidney stubbornly tries to take up the metabolic load. But the latest sonograms suggest it's going to go south pretty soon as well. In which case, dialysis and/or transplant is my option.I'm not gonna do dialysis. Just not. I say that now. I may change my mind."},

{"title": "Cinderella Theory", "date": "Wednesday, January 28, 2015", "text": "Three weeks ago, Kepler astronomers found eight planets that are in their star's \"goldilocks zone\" - not too hot, not too cold, but just right for liquid water.Now, there is a lot more going on than just having an orbit that fits into circumstellar habitable zone. Those planets will need a certain range in mass, a certain balanced chemical composition, a presence of liquid water, but not too much or too little, in order for our kind of life to emerge and thrive.It actually gets pretty complicated pretty quickly, and so I would suggest that the wrong fairy tale is being referenced, that rather than Goldilocks and the Three Bears, we would be better off with Cinderella.Cinderella is a beautiful young girl being abusively raised by her wicked stepmother and tortured by her wicked stepsisters. Her fairy godmother helps her go to a ball where she meets a handsome prince, loses a slipper, and runs away. The handsome prince scours the kingdom looking for the owner of the lost shoe, finds Cinderella, the shoe fits, and they live happily ever after.So, the analogy of Cinderella is only going to go so far. But let's try it anyway. The Cinderella is the planet. The prince is carbon-based, water-mediated life. The wicked stepmother and stepsisters are the universe at large, which - despite the increasing empirical evidence of possessing extremely fine-tuned physical constants  to harbor our kind of life - is quite inimical towards our kind of life.What with gamma ray bursters, and supernovae, and quasars, and black holes, and colliding neutron stars, the universe, like a playful little kitten, seems determined to kill us in as cute a fashion as it can. And then there is planetary formation, with all the mathematical chaos involved in that. For every cinderella planet, a candidate for life, there has got to be a million wicked stepmothers ready to fuck things up. Like, for example, gas giants forming in unstable orbits that fling planets out into the void, or unstable stars that hiss and spit hard radiation and deadly flares, ready to freeze/dry or pan fry life at the get-go.And then there are, again, a billion ugly stepsisters for every cinderella, planets that look like Mercury, or Venus, or Mars, and just ain't never gonna give life a chance, and, in fact, may even go out of their way to fuck things up for a cinderella planet. In fact, I insist that the cinderella planet be fucked with, otherwise you don't need the later happy circumstance of a fairy godmother.And in fact that's kind of the point. If any run-of-the-mill planet can harbor life right out of the gate, it's not all that impressive. Ah, but an abused planet, one that has a tough uphill climb, one that gets a really lucky break, one that our prince finds a shoe match, why that's Earth, and the other eighteen worlds in the universe that are earthlike*.Consider Earth. It probably started out outside of the goldilocks zone, should have been frozen solid, with too little mass, gets rear-ended by a Mars-sized planetoid, which beefed up prot-earth, and just barely made an appropriately sized moon, with just the right mass, starting out at just the right orbit, with the planet rotating at just the right speed, so that our axis remained stable over billions of years. It didn't have to be that way. Someone took their magic wand and provided just the right amount of good fortune. And then the prince stopped by with his shoe, and here we are.Am I suggesting the fairy godmother is some intentional power? Nope, just dumb luck. That's how you get lucky planets like ours.In fact, as earth like planets go, I'd bet ours isn't even the most optimal. We are probably just barely marginal for supporting life.How Anthropic of the universe!"},

There are plenty of lame-ass pundits and puffed-up know-nothing billionaires out there that will give you wrong information about the future of 2015 or beyond in editorials using trending. Seriously, fuck trending. Anyone can do trending.The prognostications range from steady progress of the rosy Whiggish types to the panicky squirt-stains of the collapsitarians. And invariably no one gets anything right. Because, you know: trending.I, on the other hand, will give you the same stuff I get off on: disruptions and shit out of left field, from least to most impacting. And, as first reported in this essay, any predictions revolve around the Storage Problem.Quickly: Energy storage. How's our information part of energy storage going? Quite well. Thirty years ago, if I wanted to find something out, I'd head to the library, rummage through books or magazines, maybe even hit up the microfiche, and it would take hours or days to find out what I needed to know. Ten, or even twenty years ago, I'd use google or altavista or yahoo search. Now I talk to my mobile. Storage access has become more ephemeral over time, but search time is way, way down. This storage problem - if you ignore Big Data (and that problem is solved with quantum computing) - is well in hand for now. So, if you think of a battery for information, then the battery is quite large, getting exponentially or polynomially larger, and access/exchange is adequate.The rest of the storage problem? Because once you start thinking of things in terms of batteries...Have a look at this article, as, even though a lot of people poke fun at the article itself, it has a great graphic model that informs my take on things.R Kummel, credit cdn.phys.orgThis little model train set pretty much sums up the workings of the super organism consisting of us food-powered robot monkeys with one weird quasi-eusocial insect mutation. You will notice from the comments in the article that most people say, \"well duh you included energy in the model\". Yup. The nice thing about this model is it is a network where you can weight the effects of the nodes and the links, like little dials that you can twist and turn and see what happens when you change the weighting.Well, number one is labor, because without all those food-powered robots, you got no network period. But...Your energy source matters. Turn that energy dial down. Back when it was muscle and animal power, or muscle and wind, wood-fire, and water power, creativity and labor mattered a lot more.Capital kicks in with leveraged infrastructure (aqueducts, dams, mill races, windmills, etc), but labor is still number one. (Really, still is, if you consider that the world was still pretty much neolithic subsistence farming well into the late 20th century...).courtesy algebralab.orgCrank the dial up to use fossil fuels, and capital takes over (not management, that's labor, but the physical instrumentalities of capital become increasingly important). Crank that dial up even further, and you start to surf the crest of the S-curve. So, playing with that dial, historically speaking? Yeah, trending. But there can be surprises, and that's what I'm interested in.But maybe we are thinking of the energy dial the wrong way. Maybe that dial should more properly be thought of as a spigot. So, think of that energy box as, not quite infinitely large, but finitely huge, and the spigot/dial is the flow through we get - going from very low (muscle power), to very high (fission/fusion). So now, it's actually energy density that we are varying. And so, my predictive disruptions ranging from low to high:1) Somebody builds a better battery. Maybe even an atomic battery! Alright maybe not an atomic battery, but let's say a battery that gets us close to the same energy density as gasoline. Hook it up to a renewable, and make it fairly mobile, and watch out. A new battery just accelerates things. Probablity? Inevitable. Impact? Not that much. In the developed world, more and more mobile devices and more powerful power tools. Maybe some decentralization in the power grid. In the developing world? Leapfrog with solar panels and power wagons loaded up to travel anywhere to supply electricity. It's starting to happen. this just accelerates the leapfrog some.2) Fusion or LENR or compact safe fission( yes, it can be done). Well, it all depends on how big it is. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that only a government or corporate consortium could build fusion, as I expect fusion plant to be a behemoth. Strike that. Corporations are timid people, friends. Probability? Low. Impact? Not immediate, but over a generation, and entirely different world.3) Not-so-low temperature superconductors. Maybe even room temperature? I'm not counting on that, but the physics news rumors are that we are getting closer and closer to understanding superconductivity, and we might have a breakthrough. Our material manipulations are getting finer and finer. Probability? Inevitable. Impact? Holy shit!Let's hope 2015 is our Holy Shit Year."},

His house is surrounded by neighbors in the woods of south of town, but for all the human contact I had, it might as well have been a cabin in the Yukon.By the end of the week, some people would have the electric taste of steel and gun oil in their mouths (and that would have made for an interesting scene with brother coming home and me quickly pulling the barrel of a shotgun from under my incisors, pulling my big toe away from the trigger, and saying \"Oh hi! You're home early!\").I'm not one of those people. Not that I haven't had thoughts of suicide. Everyone does. No I mean I am perfectly happy all by lonesome - and that may be a huge problem for me. I can entertain myself pretty much indefinitely, and I know few other people who can crack themselves up the way I can.\"What are you laughing at?\"\"Oh... nothing\".It's not just me that is possessed of a rich internal life. I've asked my brothers and they all get along quite well on their own. I know other people - extroverts, I'd suppose you'd call them - who start to go quite bonkers without feedback from other people.Of course, intoxicants really help. But I have a solid protocol on that. I'm disciplined about it.No having fun until all the work is done. Drinking alone? Not a problem. (Only people who are worried that they are alcoholics worry about drinking alone). After dinner? Definitely, unless out to eat, in which case a cocktail or two is required. So, I get fucked up later in the evening, and usually curtail it around the witching hour. Besides, it's the holidays, so what else I got to do? So, if you saw a late night message that was not entirely coherent? Yeah, that was probably me...I brought my macbook and keyboard with so I could practice chords and scales on the piano via garageband. That is a nightly thing anyway.

(One a cannon shot all over the basement throw rug, which went outside for the residents to take care of). The dogs are used to sleeping on the bed with their family. I wasn't going to do it, but after one night of barking and whining, I gave up and let them sleep with me. And you know what? It was quite pleasant. They didn't stink or fart or anything.I had to keep an eye on them when they went out, because they are little dogs, and there are coyote and bobcat and lynx out in the woods.

It was a hundred times the size of my corner space. I saw outdoor gear, clothes, tents, ropes, sleeping bags, survival accessories, cook stoves, cook wear, lanterns, hand tools, motors, generators, power tools, knives, machetes, axes, explosives, guns. Guns. Lots and lots of guns.\"Sporting goods?\" I asked at the counter, shaking hands. “ Wilderness experience?”\"Estate management\", Aaron answered.=======================Meat is how Alterra makes money. Alterra is a world about like the Earth back in the Miocene. Big mammals. Big. Pretty much everything elephant-sized big. And so? Big predators! Lions the size of rhinos. Wolves the size of bears.  Bears the size of, well you get the idea. Humanity found itself about halfway up the food chain. Again. But all the money is in the meat harvest. Those delicious mammoth steaks and giant ribs and meat bits aplenty are what Earth wants. If you are on Alterra, being a cowboy, hunter, trapper, herder, zoo worker, or manager thereof, is what you want to be about. =======================“So when Nixon allowed Texas to secede, the state of Texas emigrated to the planet Texas?” asked Mr. Merkin.“That’s right. Through the Houston Astrodome Portal” I answered. “30 million of them at least.”(I’m teaching a class in consistent histories because the wormhole network is preternaturally dimmed down and I can’t earn without it. This teaching gig is charity from the colony, and a college credit class for my fellow unemployed).“A good part of the South went along.” I continued, and swept my hand across the map of the continental United States of America. “Basically? The Confederacy. Henry Kissinger negotiated an amicable divorce. Most every berg from the Mason-Dixon line on south was now chocolate city.”They stared at me.“All the white people left. Most of them. There was still a big waiting line, when Houston lost power. Wormhole collapsed. When contact was regained, there was nothing there. Empty space.”Ms. Murka raised her hand. “A Lost Colony?”“The first! Of many. Lesson there? Don’t turn the wormhole off!”Laughter.“So, but then we get in contact with them again! But, you know, spooky action at an instance, and the Confederacy is 10,000 years in the future.”“And that’s why the giant Texan warbot terrorizes us and tries to infest us with mechanical bacteria??” asked Ms. Murka.Yes, Nancy” I sigh. “and I’m sorry, but we are working on that”. =======================Aaron and Claire Willis are my next store neighbors in Spiral City, on the planet Alterra, galaxy NGC 6264, almost half a billion light years from Earth. I think it’s unusual to love your neighbors, but I do love them.Claire is the station master at the wormhole. Everyone loves Claire. She’s gorgeous. Vivacious. Superlative. Claire and Aaron have three children. Craig, out East, carving out the meat empire. Aaron Jr. studying on Earth. Cory, the baby, captured me from the start. She might as well be my daughter. Aaron is, well, what isn’t he? Scrounger? Fixer? Hustler? Mayor?Did I mention they are black? Is it important? It shouldn’t be, but now it is.“You two do realize you are both black, right?” I asked. “The only black people out here? On this here uberweisse planet?” They looked at me and smiled... and continued to smile. I frowned...finally I figured it out. Willis. Brontoburgers Willis. Dinoburgers. The Willis Clan owned the best quarter of this here uberweisse planet. My new neighbors are trillionaires.=======================Edward Hopper, the giant robot from the Empire of Texas, had tried to infest Alterra with miniscule mechanical creatures. The plan was to give him - and by proxy the Intergalactic Empire of Dixie - total control over every living thing on the planet. It didn’t quite work out because of the Kraken. The Kraken are big furry alien octopus monsters that are a billion years ahead of humanity. The Kraken had unleashed a virus on Alterra months before Edward Hopper unleashed his mechanical plague. The virus disabled the mechanicules as they were spawned. Why the Kraken didn’t just stop Ed from doing all that shit to begin with, I don’t know. =======================It was all that President Nixon had hoped, but not how he planned. It wasn’t the inner cities and rural poverty districts that depopulated. It was the Great White Flight into the cosmos. The last, and greatest, liberal welfare project ever.Nixon did what he could to steer folks he wanted gone. Along with the Northern Cities, wormhole stations were set up in Knoxville, Baltimore, Birmingham, Baton Rouge, St. Louis, New Orleans. The black and brown folk did not leave. They took jobs instead. It was the biggest economic boom in American history. Huntsville was and will be Rocket City, but Detroit became Nuclear Rocket City. KC, Mo? What don’t they do there? Oakland, Memphis, Cleveland, Toledo humming on government war production budgets, cranking out yolk for all those interstellar zygotes.Ah, but then things went sour.  The start was a news leak of wormhole dumping, toxic garbage and radioactive waste dropped into deep space. Almost cost Nixon the reelection. Well, that, and the lost colonies, and the space deaths, and Spiro Agnew, and country club black markets and profiteering, and... but you know, cosmic irony, Nixon gets a second term.=======================It got on week twenty of the wormholes all dimmed down. The colony had broken into the warehouses: older technology pulled out that did not use electricity. I used the darkened store for sleeping between odd jobs. It was a sloppy mess. Aaron walked in, looked about with a smirk.“Bachelor Man!” he sang out.“Hi Aaron.”\"Are you still in contact with Ed Hopper?\"\"Not recently. But as a matter of fact, he came to me in a dream last night.\"“So? Well! Meteor Bay? South-east shore thereof?”“Si?”“Jimmy Mungo was down there yesterday. He tells me he saw something weird.”“When can we go?”Aaron smiled a million watts. “Now!”=======================Jimmy Mungo’s name wasn’t Jimmy Mungo. Jimmy Mungo was Howard Pogue, originally from Melbourne, Australia. =======================The Convergence is that entendu of superpositions of the universe where humanity survives.The Convergence is abstracted out of a very shaky holographic gestalt, but there are set points.Contact with the Kraken is one. It gets the Convergence rolling.Only Nixon can meet the Kraken.=======================Jimmy Mungo piloted the electric airplane over Meteor Bay.Aaron’s daughter Cory was his co-pilot apprentice. Aaron and I sat in back with drinks. Aaron poked me and pointed down.“Gorgeous!” I nodded.It was gorgeous. Meteor Bay seen from its north cape, the green water to the west tracing to the thinnest of arcs. To the south, the water turned blue again, and it looked like a new sea off to the east, but no, its the bay. The crater.We hugged the coast turning east, flew over sandy islands and reefs, approached the shore of a peninsula. The blue water turned green again.“HEY!!”“WOW!”“Cool!” cried Cory.“Fuck” I said.Down below us was a city of giant fungi. Square miles of skyscraper sized mushrooms. A forest of nickel clad toadstools below this canopy. Stalks of liquid metal. Pearlescent and oily white superellipsoids floating or perched about like bird blimps and popcorn. Surfaces of fine china and soot carpet the floor of this rain forest, this factory, this rain forest, fading east and up to a monotone.In the center, big red brick smokestacks a quarter mile high, gills and stone veils crawling down them. Once belching out billions of tons of mechanicules, now quiet. And wouldn’t you know, a speck of gold tinsel waving at us, a tinkerbell on shore. Edward Hopper. Jimmy Mungo pressed the plane close to shore and landed on pontoons. We cast up on a spit less sparse of the eldritch living machine growths. Edward Hopper, resplendent in gold imperial, waded over to tower above us. I was scared, in front of this giant mechanical war god, his vast citadel arrayed around me. I feared for my life, but I was also very angry.“You! Asshole! I shouted “Fucking! Asshole! Cocksucking! Motherfucker! This is bullshit! Bullshit! This ends today! Okay? You prick? All this shit! Just leave us the fuck alone! Please!”“Mr. Hopper?” Aaron asked, holding his palms up. “What do you want?”“Well, it’s more what you need.”“I get it.” Aaron turned to me “He is a dick, isn’t he?” He shouted slowly to Hopper, “What do you want?” “Respite. Healing. In case you haven’t noticed...” Ed Hopper indicated his golden body. Up close, Ed Hopper was not so resplendent. The gash on his thigh, received from Kraken claw, had not healed. “Jesus Ed!” I commiserated, turned to Aaron and muttered “This is a limited time offer”.“He is correct.” Ed said, “I am slowly rotting from the inside out, and this citadel as well. Only a week at best before we die.”Aaron grunted. “And what bargaining chip do we have? How can we help you?”Hopper pointed at me. “He can call off this curse.”Aaron frowned.  “Why should he? You’re a bully. You’re a monster. You’ve terrified everybody with your antics. Everyone.”“I was only trying to help.”\"Oh, easy, then” Aaron laughed. “Go die!”“Okay, hang on” Ed Hopper held up his hands. “You need electricity, Mr. Mayor. I can’t build transmission lines now. I can send batteries up to Spiral City right now”. He clapped his hands. Five cold iron things lurched forward. They were 55 gallon drums with dunce caps on top and four War of the Worlds tentacle legs attached. They stumbled in a drunken walk, leaning and swaying side to side.“What are those tipsy things? I asked.“Those are.. tipsies. Each can pump out ten megawatts per hour for two weeks. Plug and play, or hack away. It gets you back on the network today.”“Well. I don’t trust you, babycakes. We sure as hell don’t trust your freaks” Aaron replied. “I can do more. I can build more animals. Mineral or elemental refinement. Mining robots. Transportation. Warriors. To protect you from the big predators.”“It still sounds like an army you want to build, Ed.\"\"I really mean well. I'm trying to help.\"No. No, thank you.”Ed Hopper slumped down dejectedly.=======================“...Ah, son of a-!” I caved, old softie that I am. “If I can heal him, I have to try.”Aaron stared hard at me. “Whatever, man.”“Edward Hopper, do you renounce Satan and all his works?”“ I do.”“Heh. OK. Edward Hopper! Do you want to be healed? Do you want to rejoin the bliss of You robot brethren and sestren? Do you?  Get on your knees! Get on your knees and pray to the furry octopussies with me!”Edward Hopper got upon his knees, and clasped his hands, and I did likewise, and we prayed. We prayed to the furry octopussies that my friend Edward Hopper and all his servants and all his works be healed. And it was so.=======================We’d found some wood and set it alight. Dinner followed. We settled down around the merry fire, Cory leaned against her dad. Jimmy tossed logs and poked the fire. I drank heavily. Edward Hopper a seated statue, nickel plate handsome in the firelight. \"If this were a story?” observed Cory “This is all just stupid.\"“Oh, don’t just say stupid. How is it stupid?”“Nothing has really changed. Right? Mr. Hopper started out terrorizing you guys. Now he’s indispensably terrorizing you guys. And the other stuff?” smiled Cory, “Yeah?”“There is no point to it. And what was with that praying to the aliens miracle? Really?” I thought a bit, and said, “In this boundless universe, there are bound to be beings that are like gods to us... That doesn’t mean we should worship them. Prayer isn’t the same as worship, hon”. “I know that.”“Really?”“Yeah!”  “Well then, on to the next story.”"},

Time for daddy's rectal feeding! Stat!\" RRARRH!\". Cheney wouldn't find anything wrong with all this. What's the problem? ).Of course, I have to assume that there are people smarter than me in the CIA, who know that the best way to extract information is through kindness. Get them all comfy, stroke them with compliments, get the ego all expansive and ready to brag, and you get yourself all the information you want. I'm reminded of the story of the Nazi interrogator Hanns Scharff, who used his used car salesman techniques to get info from Allied airmen.This is not an isolated case, I can't remember what book it was in, but I read of two other cases, one a Mossad interrogator of hardened Palestinian terrorists, the other a NYC police detective (\"If I could get them to use my first name, I knew I had them\"), also used these techniques. Any good parent uses these techniques.So, if the CIA spooks are smarter than me, they know this, and they know that strong arm tactics, 3rd degree stuff, gives unreliable or false information, and so they must be doing this out of sheer infantile sadism and spite, and to send out the message that the old white vampires still mean business, to show the world that the bumbling amateurs in ISIS are mere pikers compared to us.Problem is, if you present yourself as a intolerable, inexorable threat, inevitably people will get rid of you when the opportunity presents itself... jess sayin'."},

You are not an immortal slave. You are not forced to kowtow to assholes.

In short, we finally got rid of the vampires)...... but you've got this brain that is clearly not designed for immortality. So how are you going to cope with the clutter of extended memories and challenges to how you think and live, adaptive behaviors for same seem to become more brittle over time? Actually, Charlie puts it like this:\"But your cognitive functioning is burdened by decades of memories to integrate, canalized by prior experiences, dominated by the complexity of long-term planning at the expense of real-time responsiveness. Every time you look around you are struck by intricate, esoteric cross-references to that which has gone before. Every politician, celebrity, actor, blogger, pop star, author ... you've seen someone like them previously, you know what they're going to say before they open their mouth. Every new policy or strategy has failure modes you recognize: \"that won't work\" is your usual response to change, not because you're a curmudgeonly pessimist but because you've been there before. Maybe you're going to make extensive use of lifeloggers or external prosthetic memory assistance devices—think of your own personal google, refreshing your memory whenever you ask the right question—or maybe you're going to float forward in time through a haze of forgetting, deliberately shedding old context to make room for fresh. Some folks try for rolling amnesia with a 40-70 year horizon behind them. You gradually lose contact with such people because they just don't want to know you any more. Others try to hang on to every experience, wallowing in the lush, intricate texture of an extended lifespan until their ability to respond is so impaired that they appear catatonic. Which are you going to be? And how will you cope with a century of memories contained in the undecaying flesh of indefinitely protracted adulthood?\"Okay, I'll bite. And I'll just tell you straight off what I will be. I will be what I already am now: a member of a tribal AI*. Only, because this is Charlie's utopian WEIRD future, I'll be electronically mediated and distributed. This is not to say I'm a Borg or anything, just that I'll be a electronically and computationally enhanced version of a member of the strange loosely-connected hive mind that humanity already is. In short, humanity is already a collective AI, and computers are just another part of it. This is my answer to Hawkings' fearful vision of AI. We are already AI. (If you want a more specific future example, trends in computation and engineering suggest both electronically enhanced brains, and brain to brain communication is inevitable. The expanded mental capacities combined with tighter coupling of communication should - should - produce even more innovation and socially cohesive good works, leading to even more progress. Not an exponential Singularity, mind you, but a really grand S curve up to the carrying capacity of humankind).(Oh, and also, those wearable electronic devices that will hook all our brains up? You end looking like you are wearing a bonnet and an apron, because they find out the second brain of the gut needs consulting as well).So, I will continue to be a part of my tribal AI, but I'll be more choosy. You will note that tribal AIs, in the form of organizations, have pushed that portion of culture known as technology to lots of different places, with no end of innovations in sight. These tribal AIs have allowed humanity to live in every single Earthly environment, and even go to the Moon, and live in orbit.One salient attribute of these tribal AIs is a purposeful collecting of various skills, talents, and intentions, in the various forms of meritocratic/familial collectives, to best choose and pursue these group goals and/or products/activities/artifice/manifested dreams.More importantly, I would suggest that the most effective groups are the ones that get along well.(What's that you say? Fitness selection at a group level? Blasphemy!)They are composed of kindred spirits, or more concisely, friends and loved ones. Yes, even guilds and corporations, the effective ones, have a shared love of something, a generosity of spirit, an urge to put the welfare of others in the group above themselves, which in turn, I would suggest, attracts talented people who get along with each other.So, a trend from my take (that we continue to be members of tribal AIs) is that matchmaking services will be in even more demand for us immortals. Looking for just the right organization to join and get along in, to be cherished in, to be a valued member of, will be of more importance than a strict qualification set of competencies.*I come to this conclusion based upon some hints Charlie provided which I didn't see any of his audience pick up on:\"Watch a pair of 70-80 year olds who've been together for half a century some time. They often appear to ignore each other, because they have such a strong internal model of the other's mind that they can anticipate their partner's words or actions: it's an ignorance derived from deep insight and familiarity, not obliviousness. There's some evidence from cognitive psychology that we use our partners or children or other relatives as external content-addressable memory storage, relying on their shared experience to fill in our patchy recollections: just like google. (Google isn't making our memory obsolete, rather it's plugging into an existing interpersonal human mechanism at a very low level.)\""},

Make them temporary workers. And from there, why, it's all downhill. They don't have any real legal recourse, once they accept that first humiliation, but now it all looks so entrepreneurial!Lesson? Never invite a vampire into your house.Case in point: North Dakota. The person involved is Burlington Northern Railroad. The key passage for me in this article is:\"On June 20, 2011, the Schwalbes received a letter informing them that Burlington Resources intended to forge a 30,883.94-acre oil production unit that would effectively override their lease agreement with Marathon and subsume their mineral property. In the Bakken, such units are typically 1,280 acres.The Schwalbes were instructed to sign a ratification agreement by August, when a hearing was scheduled on what some started calling “the mega-unit.” The mega-unit would include the Little Missouri State Park, a patchwork of private, state and federal land beloved for its rugged trails.Initially perplexed by the thick document on their doorstep, the Schwalbes soon grasped a painful point: though they would be ceding control of their mineral property, their consent was not required. Only the owners of 60 percent of the unit’s minerals were needed for ratification, and Burlington, together with the federal government, already met that goal.“That’s part of why they chose Corral Creek for their scheme,” Dr. Chaffee said. “They didn’t have to deal with a lot of fleas like us, the pesky citizens.” Sound familiar? For this part of the country, it should: \"For as long as grass grows and rivers run, the tribes shall have the right to possess, occupy, and use the lands allotted to it\".History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. And the Conquest of the New World would seem the best analogy I can use as comparison. But now individuals are the Redskins."},

Don't be.We've had these things - these organizations - since at least the time of the Sumerians, and, true, they make life miserable for a lot of us citizens, and they do seem to be hellbent on wrecking our habitable living spaces, but they sure don't display much in the way of real intelligence, even a planned malevolent intelligence actively trying to commit genocide (can't even manage to get that right).See, the thing I've noticed about these collective entities is that seem to get their tasks down despite themselves. It's not that there are not neat things happening. It's like, if you peer inside a black box you see all sorts of clever and wondrous elvish behaviors and tactics and coping mechanisms, but when you look at the black box, it just takes the inputs and stupidly poops out the outputs according to some least common denominator version of cheap-ass processing.Mine is admittedly an anecdotal experience, but I've worked for five successful multi-billion-dollar corporations, and the thing I notice was they all made money despite themselves. It was always weakest link in the chain kind of stuff (and granted, these are hierarchical collective command structures, but a more distributed network still has the same weak links. I'll go further, and suggest that these links are made weak by the very globally emergent properties of these collective minds.You know, I think I started to think about this back in high school, or perhaps before. It may have been exposure to Carl Jung's notion of the collective unconscious, but no, it was science fiction reading. Maybe Jack Vance, but for sure Fritz Lieber. I still remember a (paraphrased) line from Leiber's \"The Foxholes of Mars\"  where the protagonist, battling his alien enemy, has the feeling of the two of them being \"epithelial cells scraped off the skin of two warring monsters\".And that, more than anything, gave me the idea that bigger and smarter is not necessarily bigger and smarter. True, you see it in ant colonies, where the behavior of the super organism is much sophisticated than an individual ant, and true, humankind as a whole has done things like land probes on comets, but then, you can also get ants to engage in a death march around the rim of a bowl, and humans to (maybe someday) annihilate themselves in nuclear armageddon.So, it came to my attention that AI was bandied about over at Edge.org. I haven't been able to read edge for at least ten years now. Those fuckers can't seem to put forth a substantive discussion without using ten words where one will do. And once you condense what they are saying into a more palatable and digestible form, it's usually old wine in new bottles. I never rarely seem to learn anything new from these smart fuckers. Okay, enough snark.Anyway, that's what prompted me to write about this subject. It doesn't mean that a superior collective intelligence isn't an existential threat, it's just that this is not a new threat."},
{"title": "Saturday Bronze Pour 11/15/2014", "date": "Monday, November 17, 2014", "text": "I gave my safety lecture with my cupped right hand brimming with blood and hidden behind my back. It was the tiniest cut on the pad of my ring finger, but it was from a broken shard of slag off the crucible. At one silica-molecule-thick, glass is the sharpest edge in the universe. I had taken aspirin as a blood thinner that morning, so that one little tiny cut bled a good quarter cup before it was done.Eventually, the blood started to overflow and drip onto the pavement, and a student noticed it.\"You're bleeding\", he discretely murmured.\"I know\", I replied \"Consider it an object lesson\".It almost screwed up my speech, but either people did not notice, or chose not to. And I had practiced a long time on that speech. In front of a mirror.Are you surprised that I practice speeches? Well, I do. I'm trying to engage my students, impart the maximum information in the minimum time, and keep their attention from wandering. Like any performer, I hone my delivery and content, culling what doesn't work, keeping what gets a laugh, but more importantly, a laugh that drives the particular point home.So, that bleeding threw off my touch and timing some. Parts where I thought would rivet them drew puzzled stares. Parts where I became alarmed at the bleeding through me off, but I got back on track and went through okay. I mean, that's why I practice my delivery, right?My post-mortem of the Saturday bronze cast is that it went well, but I failed to allow my students to participate more. I know exactly why it happened. We had over fifty pieces, and some 560 lbs of bronze to pour, and me doing 85% of the heavy lifting meant that we got done in a timely fashion. We started at 9am and (I) went non-stop to 4pm, and I didn't want to go beyond that.So... this time out, I pretty much was the attendant at the roller coaster ride. Not so much them casting their own pieces as me muppeting them into casting their own pieces. Normally, that doesn't happen. But like I said, we had a lot of shit to go through.I'll remedy that for the next semester, and in fact, most semesters, I stand back and let them do the work.On the whole, a very good semester so far. We had zero failures and minimal defects. Almost all pieces defect free, with those with defects being hot and cold tears of the metal, due to too thick an investment shell. Well, I warned them about that...P.S. About the only thing that makes me happy lately, is staring down into the crucible and watch metal melt... which makes for some expensive therapy.P.P.S. Not to brag, but I was informed by my students on Monday, that I ROCKED!!!"},

A lot more gruesome ghoulishness is to occur until four years from now - minus one hundred years and a day - when an armistice went into effect.It's not that we've advanced any. We are the same killer ape we one hundred years ago. If anything, we've only managed to manage the carnage, and there's no reason to think we won't screw the pooch at some (near) time in the future, and do far worse than try and chew our tongues off, or poke our eyes out.Still, as bestial as we are, I don't see any other animals landing shit on comets. And if other animals  did, why, I suppose it would be our duty to wipe them out.Other things. I had probably the most horrible lunch at the college the other day. I got a chicken sandwich, and the chicken was a grisly, gristly mess. I sure do miss the socialist food service we used to have. Now, because of privatization, the food quality is down, service is shoddier, portions are smaller, and prices are up. Yay, capitalism!I expect no less once our new empty Carhartt jacket is installed in the governor's mansion that he just bought, I'm sure we can expect to see the destruction of lots public institutions, the emptying of public coffers into the pockets of rich crooks, and the ongoing race to the bottom which we have all come to expect here in America.Speaking of Bruce Rauner, I have been taking an inordinate number of poops lately. You know how, you eat a whole bunch, and you don't gain weight, but then, when you empty your bowels, this pathetic teaspoon of stool comes out. And you wonder, where the heck did the food go? Perhaps there is some extra-dimensional pocket in our innards where it gets stored, and then finally it fills up, and even though aren't eat any more than usual, suddenly you are pooping out a cornucopia, a horn of plenty of poop?Yeah, America, like that.

{"title": "Does Not Want To Be Made Manifest", "date": "Friday, October 31, 2014", "text": "This is my second biggest class, and they are cranking out the stuff. I don't think this is a record, at least in terms of amount of bronze or in number of pieces, but it's up there.One student, a musician, read up on a guy named Harry Parch. He decided he wanted to make a Parch-like instrument similar to his Gourd Tree with Cone Gongs. I had never done bellfounding, rather liked the idea of the gourd tree, and am a frustrated musician, I said why not? So, the kid is cranking out bells. Lots of bells. Not sure how this will turn out, but we are to cast a lot of bells.I'm not sure how many bells, or how he is going to tune them, as we don't have a metal lathe here. Many of the bells were fashioned from bowls, so I assume the tuning part may be mostly happenstance? I don't know.My own stuff I am having problems with. I had a wax tree work just fine until just this afternoon, when I set it down, and the weight of the investment bent a wax rod and broke the mold.My solution was to just cut off the part that broke and fashion new pouring cup for it to pour separately. And I will just seal off the break on the other part of the tree.But the other piece is just a problem child. It has broken three four times now, and I'm starting to think it does not want to exist. That, of course, is the Pathetic Fallacy. My inattentiveness is the reason for the breakage. I do pride myself in not having tantrums after they break. There was a time when I would rage for awhile before I fixed it. Perhaps getting older makes you realize that tantrums are a waste of time.In any case, I'm off to the hardware store to get furnace cement and fix it that way, as the investment is now too thick to recoat and repair."},

I mixed up the batch on Monday, which now seems like a month ago.I have been sacrificing getting my stuff ready to act as Mother Hen over the kids so that the amount of mishaps - never zero - is kept to a minimum. I actually prefer that they make mistakes, because they learn faster and the lesson is retained longer. But the mistakes must be controlled so that it is not a complete disaster. Thus, my teaching style is: let them fail, up to the recoverable point, and then step in before it is a complete wash.I just now (8:19pm, Tuesday, October 29th) finished rigging up my planned pieces to cast. I will show  you them in a second. I've kind of decided that I should do more than just document these things, but to present them as pieces of art in and of themselves. So, that's how they are presented...These are the cockroach like plutonium poppers, or something like that. The first batch of them failed, and I am keeping the failure as an teaching object for almost every casting defect you can get. And the failures were all in the rigging of the pieces. These, rigged more properly, should work fine, but we shall see...This guy, upside down, is a Tipsie Driver, or a Tipsie Herder. This looks like the mask of the Beetle King, but it is, upside down, the Chemical Segway for the Tipsie Driver.

{"title": "Done Run Out of Luck", "date": "Wednesday, October 15, 2014", "text": "The client pieces I was commissioned to cast are done. Right about one third of the way in to casting last weekend, my lance pyrometer decided to die. I had to gauge the temperature of the bronze by eye. Considering they all cast fairly OK, I have to chalk it up to being lucky.There are two conceptions of luck, or maybe five.One is that luck is random contingency, and as such is probably infinite in expanse. Given that, some would argue that it's application is random, and thus there is no correlation between lucky events. Others suggest that there may be a correlation, in which case lucky events stick together, and if you are experiencing luck, best to ride out the streak and score as much as you can. In other words, if things are working out for you, best to buy that lottery ticket.The other view is that luck is a finite commodity. This could mean that the views of its application are similar to above (either no or some correlation). I view it as, more like a Pareto distribution, in which case the events tend to congregate towards the prosaic, but one cannot ignore the fat tails of luck inhabited by black swans and dragon kings. If, as I suspect, ordinary events are the more common (more things can go wrong than can go right), then luck can be used up. I know this doesn't make much sense, but it's pragmatic principle. If I've lucked out on something, I'm unlikely  to push the envelope and buy that lottery ticket.So, anyway, I got lucky casting these things, with a minimum amount of casting defects. Two of the pieces used all the 48 pounds of metal in the crucible. One of the big ones, I poured the bronze just a tad too hot (which I could tell once we started pouring into the mold). That too hot piece I took outside into the pouring rain, and then hosed it down. (The idea being that there was a good chance the piece would not cool down fast enough and a shrink porosity defect would occur). The amount of steam was such that a good twenty foot cloud appeared, and we could have attacked an ISIS position with such cover.As it was, I did indeed have a defect in the piece, a heat tear in some interior detail.\"Well, maybe he (the client) will like that defect\" rationalized my student aide.\"Yeah, if he likes his babies with birth defects, sure\" I replied. I have noticed my tennis elbow (and left hand) have been complaining a lot. I've been soaking my left arm in ice at night, and helps, but my suspicion is the lifelong damage is there to stay, and I just have to work through the pain. And work I must do, as these metal pieces will not fix/pretty up themselves.Here's some pics.Figures rigged with my critters tagging along My rule for rigging which I must constantly remind myself: ABV! (Always Be Venting)Pieces with ceramic shell on them I would have you notice that the two hands have slightly different but similar rigging, and one ended up with a shrink porosity defect. I attribute this to not keeping the runners equidistant with respect to the thickness of the piece.Rigging is more art than science I gambled the amount of metal left in the crucible would fill the mold, and lost...Oops. Gotta fix that hole. My hands ache like you would not believe, so I take break.Grinding with air die tools It's getting harder and harder to grind/fettle/sand/file/chase stuff clean and not feel it for days afterwards.Hole in hand welded up, ground downI'm 60 in three years. I don't know if my tendonitis will go away,or if my body will hold together.  I dread not being able to do this anymore. Dread is too weak a word. I can't imagine not doing this."},
{"title": "West of the Revolution: A Book Report", "date": "Monday, October 13, 2014", "text": "West of The Revolution, by Claudio Saunt. This book takes place circa 1776, in places on the North American continent besides the English Colonies. It explores the conditions that existed beyond our parochial little world view. Like the book Empires, Nations and Families, by Anne F. Hyde, Saunt covers the real history of the Continent, the real powers that governed and ruled within America. Hyde's narrative takes place during the period 1804-1860 or so. Saunt limits himself to the decade of the Revolution, and of course, the First World War, otherwise known as the Severn Years War, or the French and Indian war. The decisions concerning the partitioning of the North American continent along the Mississippi river resonate down to this day, but not due to decisions made in the peace treaty in Paris, rather how those decisions were taken advantage of by American Indians.As Thomas Jefferson put it, after he entertained the Osage chiefs in Washington DC, \"The truth is, the Osages are the Great Nation south of the Missouri. Among them we must stand well, because in their quarter we are miserably weak\".About a month ago, Jonathan Chait wrote an essay called \"A Southern GOP Can't Be the Party of Lincoln\" detailing the North/South split of our country that started prior to the Revolution, and festers down to this day. He lays out how the Republican party is essentially now the party of the Confederacy. David Brin picked up on the theme, and riffed his own take on this ongoing  event of the divide along the Mason-Dixon line. A fairly interesting and worthwhile investigation, this examination of the North/South cultural divide within America, but it misses the far more interesting East/West divide. More to the point, the cultural difference between North and South are for the most part trivial. Both were interested in conquering and exploiting the continent west of the Appalachians, and later, west of the Mississippi.While elites of the South would have preferred a vision of of a continental realm of landed gentry and hereditary rule, patterned on jolly England, the North was willing to eschew titles and pomp, but keep the mercantile power. Both the North and the South were all about cheap labor, their visions differed only slightly. While the South opted for the idea of chattel slavery, the North preferred trading cheap food for cheap people. Both wanted to exploit labor and ingenuity of peoples to the optimum value they could wrest from them. And why not? Labor was the only sticking point, getting people to do all the work for you, as everything else was practically free, no? That was the colonial vision of lands west: a world with no history, populated by peoples of no consequence.So it is worthwhile to understand exactly what was going down outside of a tiny feeble set of English colonies clutching to the Eastern seaboard. In fact, I'm going to reproduce a striking map found in Saunt's book. Here we see the populated areas of the American colonies free of geopolitical symbolic borders. Courtesy of West of the Revolution by Claudio SauntLooks a lot like a bad case of black mold ready for some chlorine bleach, doesn't it? And honestly, had native peoples west and south had any idea what was going to happen to them over the next two hundred years, I'm sure they would have applied a generous hosing down of bleach to rid the continent of this invasive species.(And spare me the \"those Stone Age slow learners didn't stand a chance against our superior technology\" line. That's a trope that needs to die. Indians consistently and successfully bested and slaughtered European-style armies through and beyond colonial times. If you look at the map, English colonists had after almost two hundred years only made in ways into the Continent of only three weeks traveling time by foot. For every one surviving colonist, ten were sent from England, an attrition rate that few nations would find acceptable today. One of the single worst defeat, to this day, of the United States Army is the Battle of a Thousand Slain in Ohio country in 1791).Our (America's) only advantage, aside from the fact that we Europeans are a miserably filthy and disgustingly germ-ridden race, is that we were able to reproduce at something close to biological maximum. Certainly this could not have occurred in Europe, and especially Northern Europe, without the advantage of the new food crops available through the Columbian exchange. Nor could we, as a nation, have thrived without two of the largest welfare programs ever conceived: the Louisiana Purchase, and the Homestead Acts. If any stupid fat white old conservative man should bother you about how superior they are due to innate white abilities, and how they could have been successful without a single penny of government monies, I suggest you spit and laugh in that parasite's face. Those soft squishy leeches make the fictional Cadillac driving welfare queen look like a paragon of Working Class Pride. They have not the slightest clue as to how they have been coddled and pampered by government largess and the coincidence of history. Capitalism was subsidized by the treasures of the New World. Do not confuse any supposed inherent systemic superiority for sheer dumb stupid Luck.Okay, sorry for drifting. The book covers most of the continent outside of the Revolution, and contains may fascinating details.We learn how Russians conduct trade among the Aleuts: kill some, take others hostage, demand the natives hunt sea otters or they kill the hostages, then give them trinkets after they've hunted enough for them (which the Russians are ineptly incapable of doing, hunting sea otters by the way).We learn how the Spanish had at best two paltry fingers of colonization sticking up into the continental United Staes: Santa Fe, and maybe San Diego. But the whole enterprise was pretty damn pathetic for the longest time, and they relied heavily upon the charity of Indians.(In fact, this is a common them for early western US history: the people that head west rely heavily upon native american charity and the largesse of the Federal government).We learn how the Lakota from Minnesota discovered the Black Hills in 1776. The great thing about the Black Hills is, since they stick above the prairie, they trap rain. The area around the Black Hills stays rich and verdant even when the rest of the Great Plains are bone dry.We learn how, had the Creek been assisted by the stupid short-sighted Spaniards, the South may never have risen. We also learn how, had the Creek become purveyors of goods to the fastest growing slave colony of Georgia, they may have had a considerable economic clout, and perhaps could have avoided being booted off their lands in the 1830s. (In fact, had the Indians been willing to trade with the British rather than the Spanish in Cuba, I rather suspect Indian regiments would have served the South in the Civil War).We learn most especially just how poisonous were the attitudes of the Founding Fathers toward Indians west of the Appalachians, how they were at best seen as impediments, and at worse vermin to be wiped at the earliest opportunity.Most especially, we learn how fur was, for the longest time, more precious than gold. Because, quite simply Fashion is at least a 200,000 year old industry, back when we first started clothing ourselves, and for the longest time, clothes were our most important technology.When you look at a map of languages and cultures of the United States of America, you will see that ancient America is still here, despite out best efforts to wipe it all out. There may come a day when the East/West divide becomes far more important than the North/South."},

I stopped in Osseo, Wisconsin for lunch at the Norske Nook. I had meat loaf, mashed potatoes, peas and carrots, and then a big piece of blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream.Needless to say, what with this gut bomb in me, basically a thorium reactor in my belly, I started to get sleepy on I-90. Round about near the Tomah rest stop, a driver in a car next to me honked his horn and woke me up out of a probably several second slumber. That realization sent a surge of adrenaline through my system that allowed me to pull into a rest stop to get a nap.But I've often wondered if I didn't die that day.In which case, all this, the near twenty years duration since then, is perhaps a delusional afterlife experience, and hopefully some Helpers will be by soon to tell me I'm dead, and it is time to move on into the larger universe.Or perhaps this is all some compressed relativistic death experience, and only a few seconds have passed since I crashed my car in '96, and this is the experience my brain goes through: the neurons suffer screaming oxygen deprivation as the blood pirouettes out of my severed head, which rolls on down I-90 next to other pieces of me.It's not that I have any eldritch suspicions about this, it's just that that is a memory etched in my mind that is a signpost for a very different counterfactual outcome. One in which I do not exist, and you, dear reader, are not reading this.And, if such strange thing can happen to individuals, can it happen to nations, or worlds?Could it be that, in the same way I'm a little bit stuck in 1996, that the US of A is stuck in the 1970s?Doesn't it feel that way? I'm told the zenith of western civilization was 1978. (I'm not entirely sure about that, as the physical convergence of the cheeseburger, french fries, and chocolate malted first occurred in a Chicago Walgreen's in 1926, so...)But it could be that that was that, and everything has been just a mass hallucination since then?Dude, the colors!"},

Now, though Chairman Bruce came up with the term long before anyone thought it necessary, his category is now subsumed within mine.As I've stated in another essay, my definition of Nostalgia Industries are any human activity or artifice, that is supplanted by something more modern. Example: LPs, film cameras, manually operated looms...Take the LP boom, vinyl records are being made again, and styluses, and people like analog sound. You also can find buggy whip manufacturers, and even, yes, stone knapping kit manufactures (in case you want to make a stone hand axe). The fact of the matter is, no matter how sophisticated and digital we become, we can't live entirely in our heads. We like, and need, things that can be handled, and that are part of the word, part of the natural world, that are simple, homely, and... real. It is likely that we shall remain as embodied minds inhabiting a physical substrate (rather than, say, being uploaded into a supercomputer to live an unencumbered virtual life), and as such, we would prefer things that can be handled, that are... real.If you accept an optimist's view of history, that humankind and knowledge and progress continue forward, then the Nostalgia Industries are a guaranteed growth regime. There will always be jobs in the Nostalgia Industries. Moreover, curatorial jobs will be the types of jobs that there are. Rewarding jobs, filled with dignity. This is a good thing. Skills will be retained, threatened materials will be required, conservation and restoration techniques conserved and refined. This requires that we bring a sense of stewardship to what would otherwise be little better than a life of mindless bacterial replication and consumption. (And we know how that's going, with a thousand times the extinction rate prior to our preeminent rise upon the planet).But it gets better! Consider, for example, that as each formerly new artifice or industry becomes obsolete, it can in turn be combined and permuted with other obsolete forms of artifice! So, like wood cuts? How about sampled woodcuts, edited upon a clunky old computer, printed off using a clunky old 3D printer or similar gadget. Like those funky old wearable computational devices? Spruce them up with intaglio techniques, embed them in a really nice piece of textile cranked out on a power loom.The thing is, though, and rather like avant-garde art, you can't do the new unless you understand the old, and you can't understand the old if it disappears. All the more reason to preserve not just human things, but the very substrate that allows humanity to exist at all: the natural world. As such, hobbyist fetishism just might help play a role in trying to conserve as much of our world as we can, which would be good for everything.The possibilities, the longer we hang around as a species, could be endless..."},
{"title": "Rubber, Meet Road ", "date": "Tuesday, September 9, 2014", "text": "Briefly, and hopefully, solely for this year, my political predictions.It's gonna suck.In Illinois, Bruce Rauner will take the governorship. Bruce Rauner will suck as governor.Illinois, known for a corrupt state government, is going to move down the path of a different kind of corruption. Rauner, a vulture capitalist like Romney, who thinks that term limits are a good idea (term limits are anti-democracy and basically mean that you, the voter, are too fucking stupid to know when to get rid of someone), has proven himself to be every bit the careerist politician that he denounces. He claims that, as a rich guy, he will incorruptible and can stand up to special interests. Funny how that claim never manages to pan out in real life. Why, even the Founding Fathers couldn't live up to that claim.When Rauner is elected, you will see the same crowd enriching themselves off the public dole. True, new characters will be introduced as the state sells off much of its assets to Rauner's cronies. (And not just Rauner's cronies. In politics, everyone gets paid, especially the opposition). Payments will made for privatization of state services, which will entail shuttering public institutions in favor of services provided by Rauner cronies, to the tune of shoddier products, shittier services, and in smaller dollops. There is no reason to think that the neoliberal trend started under Reagan/Thatcher will reverse itself before another generation is wasted. My prediction is that Illinois will become a failed state like Somalia... or Kansas. Still, the .01% will do very well from this failure.Likewise, at the federal level, the Senate will go Republican. This presents an interesting problem for the GOP. Formerly, their strategy was to obstruct, or at the least, sit on the sidelines and piss and moan. This strategy worked well enough so long as they were not in power. Well, with a gerrymandered forever lock on the House, and then a majority in the Senate, Republicans will be forced to govern.They realize they have a problem. I know that they don't have a solution. As such, Obama will enjoy an easy two years of lame duck presidency, happily vetoing whatever dip-shittery the GOP Congress spastically squirts his way. The GOP seems quite determined to turn the 2012 presidential clown car into a 2014 congressional clown frat house.Great for entertainment purposes, not so great for the average American citizen (especially those who fall below the predatory economic extraction borderline into the Harvest Zone - that area where, if you are the wrong color, or of the wrong birthplace, or don't earn enough, you will be harvested by the appropriate private and corporate-owned-public instruments).So, if you thought life wasn't shitty enough, get ready to not be disappointed!"},
{"title": "About A Mountain: A Book Report", "date": "Tuesday, August 26, 2014", "text": "About A Mountain by John D'Agata is not really about Yucca Mountain, the proposed site of radioactive waste disposal from the nation's nuclear industry. At first I thought it was, but now I'm realizing it's really about the end of things.(I included the Powell's book review in the link because I really find I don't want to talk so muc about John's book, which I do recommend, but rather on the theme I think he is covering - which is that everything is coming inevitably to an end, and so it's rather absurd to worry about it, or plan overmuch for it).Yucca Mountain, as D'agata mentions, is probably the most studied piece of real estate on the planet. I don't think the studies were done to determine the safety or efficacy of storing all of that radioactive poison in a secure place for the amount of time it takes for it to become harmless. That amount of time - probably on the order of 250,000 years - is beyond current planning. Yucca was planned for 10,000 years, but that turns out to be basically just a made-up number that a lot of people will accept as \"far enough in the future for us not to worry about shit\".Yucca, as far as I can determine, was really about income redistribution. You know, the kind that rich people don't mind at all, where the monies end up in their pockets. How else can you explain so much money wasted on something that was known by any rationally informed human from the get-go to be nothing more than wishful thinking?Consider 250,000 years ago, humans, depending upon whom you talk to, were just becoming anatomically modern, and were probably already possessed of the majority of what we consider modern mental faculties. They had domesticated fire, had good facility with stone, wood, bone, leather, and rope technologies. They certainly were working on symbolic thought. I don't think any objective evaluator would have a doubt that these bipedal primates would inevitably split the atom.(Seriously, nuclear fission reactors appeared soon after an oxygenating atmosphere allowed for uranium salts to be accumulated in water percolating through the right kinds of rock, so it's not a stretch to think that a combination of the same ores, charcoal, water, and monkeys would produce the same criticality through informed empiricism, or even brute force trial and error).Question is, what about 250,000 years into the future? Any ideas? I can think of one. We are extinct. The rate we are going? With the capitalist free market system devouring everything in sight? With, not just an acceleration, but the next derivative up, a shock taking place throughout all areas of human habitation, I'm guessing we don't make it with the current trend.I'm guessing D'agata is feeling the same way, which is why he treats Yucca as kind of a silly waste of time. At least that's the impression I got.When you consider that there are already several million tons of radionuclides circulating through Earth's natural systems due to the past near 80 years of dumbfuckery, an estimated 77,000 tons of high level nuclear waste doesn't seem all that important, especially when we won't be around to worry about it?In summary, a fun book to read, and I enjoyed it."},

{"title": "Junkyard Planet: A Book Report", "date": "Friday, August 22, 2014", "text": "Junkyard Planet by Adam Minter. Had I read this book when I was sixteen, I have no doubt I would be in the junk business. There is an excitement to the junk trade that I found compelling. No doubt this is the same excitement people on the Antiques Roadshow experience when they find out the piece of the junk in their attic is worth a significant amount of money.Take, for example, this story about how Leonard Fritz made his fortune and founded one of the largest recycling facilities in the country:\"Back when Leonard Fritz was first starting out, steel mills had dumps where trash and the residues of steelmaking were thrown away. This latter category was represented by sand, bricks, and bits of steel that fell away during the manufacturing process. Of these steel bits, the most plentiful were the thin flakes that form on the surface of hot steel as it cools. \"Mill flakes\" as those flakes were called, was pretty much useless in 1938....Elsewhere in Detroit, Armco Steel, a major supplier to the automobile industry, was testing a new type of steel furnace. But Armco was dealing with an expensive problem: preparing ore for the furnace cost roughly $100 per ton. So the designer of the new furnace, a metallurgist who happened to be daughter of the mill's president, did some calculations and figured out that if you added a substance with the chemical makeup of mill scale, the preparation process would speed up and the cost would drop by $99 per ton, to $1. But where on earth could Armco get enough mill scale to feed its furnace. For reasons lost to history, the job of sourcing that mill scale landed in the hands of the metallurgist's young husband, who was visiting the Kelsey-Hayes wheel forging plant near Detroit on July 2, 1938. As it happened, Leonard Fritz was busy screening a three-hundred-ton pile of mill scale in the parking lot of the Kelsey-Hayes forging plant that day, working at an agreed-upon rate of $1.25 per ton... 'Ah, how much of that mill scale do you have there young man?' 'I figure there's about three hundred tons.' 'That won't be enough.' 'Well, how much do you need?' 'What I'm looking for is three thousand tons.' Leonard Fritz was only fifteen, but he already knew a few things, one of which was this: there was a dump in Detroit where mills had been dumping scale for years....'I think I can scrape it up. How much would you pay for it?' The metallurgist's young husband hesitated for a moment. 'Probably thirty-two dollars per ton.' Leonard Fritz understandably lost it. 'WHAT?' he exclaimed...'Well, thirty-six.' 'I'll do her.'...a few months later, shortly after his sixteenth birthday, Armco Steel presented Leonard Fritz with a check for $186,000. It was still 1938.\"Point being, the \"how\" and the \"where\" can send a ragpicker, or anyone really, into the ranks of those with considerable fortunes. The book has a lot of stories like that, and mainly now involving poor Chinese farmers who take America's (the Saudi Arabia of garbage) scrap, and turn into raw materials for the insatiable appetite of the world.When I was growing up in Northwest Indiana, it was easy money in the steel mills. It was also some of the foulest air you could hope to breathe. That foul air was from the coking process, where they bake the volatiles of out of coal and turn into coke, and the volatiles, in turn, coke gas, are burned to produce a shitty brown haze. That haze - and jobs at the mills - is mostly gone now. Globalization was bad for the employment conditions of the area, but good for the air. Keep in mind, steelmaking didn't go away, it just got more efficient - and when you consider that a ton of scrap converted back into steel in electric furnace equals a ton and a half of iron ore, a ton of coal, and a half ton of limestone, that isn't so bad.The scrap industry, as this book points out, is one of the greenest industries around. It may be true that a lot of horrible work-place and environmental practices occur in the developed world, where much of the scrap is recycled and purified, but these places have trouble enough just to produce clean food and water. The last thing on many people's minds over there are work conditions. (And besides, as standards of living improve, so does a demand for quality of life and environmental standards).The majority of the book takes place in China, the majority of the action revolves around metals, and the majority of the capitalist hero characters are Chinese. Not that there are not good things happening here in America, but honestly we are all pampered poodles, not willing to do the dirty work anymore, even when we can profit from it. We have to remember that, if there was no boom in China, most of our crap would end up in landfills here, or burned, or illegally dumped.Many of our broken things are sent to China, where they are repaired or repurposed, and sent on to the developed world. Part of this reuse is the resourcefulness of people in the developed world, part of this is our own wastefulness, and the distressing tendency of manufacturers to discourage repairs in favor of buying new products (and that can change, but it requires the consumer to demand it).As Mr. Minter points out, recycling is really not an indefinite process. The quality of product inevitably declines, and so recycling is really outsourcing of trash to somewhere else. What Americans can do, is to follow the other two points on the recycling can: reduce and reuse. Problem is our way of life discourages wearing of hair shirts and the practice of austerity. And so we continue to consume and dispose... Still, it is better than not using the stuff again and again. When you consider how much energy and effort has been used to extract and purify so many things from the earth, it seems rather a waste to dump them all back in again."},
{"title": "Glen O. Reeser, RIP", "date": "Tuesday, August 19, 2014", "text": "My friend Glen passed away yesterday. Here is his obituary. I'm not ashamed to say I got teary-eyed reading it. This is the second friend I've lost to cancer, and it's never gets easy.In May of 2013, he announced he had Stage Four lung cancer, and tumors in his head. After consideration and debate with his family (his sister had gone through a nightmarish treatment of cancer and died miserably), he opted for treatment. That was a good thing, as he gained an extra year and a half from it, and after treatment when he was feeling OK, he had good year. He went on trips with his wife to places they wanted to go, he got visits from his many friends and family, and visits from his \"kids\", international students he had hosted over the years.I actually didn't know Glen all that well. Glen was always was a little restrained. Always had a little formality in his relationships with me (well, so I perceived). It may be because he was a little Scandinavian? (I'm reminded of the joke about the Norwegian husband who loved his wife so much he almost told her).  My grandfather was the same way. There was always, despite some informal events, always a distance in there. Not surprisingly, like my grandfather, I found out after the fact that he was extremely charitable and altruistic and helped out a lot people without their knowing. That's a very high bar for me to work at.I transported Glen to and from chemo and radiation treatments when my schedule allowed. I also drove him to and from the bar on Thursday nights this spring and summer. (Harper College ceramics night class had a long tradition of after-class drinks and pizza on Thursday night).I think as a thank you, he built a hot wire device for cutting shapes out of plastic foam. I've never used it, and didn't have the heart to tell him. I guess I'll have to use it. It's really slick.Glen's Hot Wire Foam CutterGlen was a heavy smoker. Since I smoked for thirty-five years, I kind of have that sword of Damocles hanging over my head. Ah, but, probably no. Not in my family history, and they were all heavy smokers.I recall a time last year when I helped Glen move some e-waste out of his basement for recycling. He was heavily into the chemo stage and had lost all his hair and weight and strength, and so I had to haul all this stuff on my own, which was fine with me. He told me he needed a break and went outdoors. When I hauled up a load to my car, I found him smoking a cigarette, and he looked a little guilty.\"Are you going to give me shit?\" he asked.I replied \"You already got lung cancer. What more can happen?\"He was miserable enough as it was. Why try to quit?I really didn't expect him to make it through last summer.At the school, I only had to give him grief in a professional capacity once, as lab tech. He was making ceramic drums, and was using goat skin for the drum heads. The goat skins were stored in his locker and were really starting to stink up the place. And so I said to him \"Dude! You got to do something about those rank goat skins!\" He laughed and got them out.Glen had a work shop in his basement that included a nice metal lathe. One time he brought in a remarkable little brass device, which he placed on a hot coffee mug, and it oscillated in a very charming way.\"Oh!\" I said, \"A Sterling Engine!\"He nodded and said nothing, but later I found out from the ceramics professor that he had said \"Leave it to Kurman to be the only one to know it was a Sterling engine!\"I puffed up with pride, delighted to be absently complimented by such a smart guy.And he was a smart guy. And a good guy. I heard a cop story once about a man who's son was murdered, and he wanted to pray over the body. the cops told him not to do it, because his son's mangled body would be his last memory of him. That's not true. We choose the memory we wish.So, the memory I have is from two weeks ago, when I went to visit Glen at his house. Glen , my former student aide Scotty, Glen's wife Martha, and Glen's sister Mary Jo all sat on the porch. It was a pleasant warm sunny afterrnoon. We had beers. We had laughs. We had good conversation. Even though he needed a walker, Glen was active, aware, engaged, funny.Everyone enjoyed themselves, and that afternoon is where Glen will reside for me."},
{"title": "W.I.P.P. and the Texas Shredder", "date": "Friday, August 1, 2014", "text": "Forgot to mention the other day, I had a desire to visit the Home of the Texas Shredder, which is in Canutillo TX, just north of El Paso. There was no effing way I was even going to bring it up with my honey that we go there, though I (because I do love to go on tours of industrial manufactories if I can get in on them) desperately wanted to see one of my favorite pieces of technology.Ah, no. Not this Texas Shredder.THIS Texas Shredder.I also wanted to visit W.I.P.P. but doubt I could, and so had to satisfied with driving by the place after we went to Carlsbad Caverns. (W.I.P.P. was directly on the drive back to Amarillo).Now, why would I want to visit a weapons-grade-but-\"mixed down\" plutonium depository? Surely the twelve-year-old-boy in you can answer that. You will also perhaps remember that W.I.P.P. was in the news earlier this year?Actually, these items are all within a theme rather unsuccessfully explored some time ago, in two essays: Deep Logistics; The 100,000 Year Project. I'm not sure that exploration was needed or warranted, as the question about future deep time orientation = deep morality involves something that, as my honey sagely put it to me, is something that requires more than wisdom, a something deeper than wisdom that lies stratigraphically just beneath it, and is certainly connected to biology.Quite simply, a good start is stewardship: resource management and materials reincarnation.I point to the Texas Shredder as an example of a solution (recall that once upon a time, scrap cars in the US were a HUGE environmental problem, and probably, without fanfare, the last remnants of that problem were hauled out of the woods in, say 2008 or so, and turned into little tiny recyclable pieces of steel in places like Thailand, China, Kenya...), but also perhaps the very earliest manifestations of the maws of Sneetch Machines.Surprisingly, and perhaps a result of living a harsh and frugal life, places in the Southwest point in the direction we need to go. Perhaps Texas (and Texas, please, you haven't been a frontier state for a hundred years, so cut the shit already) can start by switching from carbon exploitation to carbon management, and from there to the other elements and compounds.So, there's that. And then W.I.P.P.? The Union of Concerned Scientists considers the project the best of  nothing but worst alternatives. I'm not sure I agree.I view the disposal downblending and sequestration of 34 metric tons of plutonium as something that we may regret in a unique way. After all, 34 metric tons of plutonium is extremely useful in the right environment - the outer Solar System. Problem is, the time when that utility is recognized to be useful in thermoelectric generators could be far in the future or never.But I would prefer, if we are going to think about anything that we, anything that we use, that we think about in the long term rather short-sighted.I read an excerpt, and as a result, now plan on reading a book called \"About a Mountain\", by John D'agata.Surprisingly, it is in the juvenile section of my local library. That's probably a good sign."},
{"title": "I Heart Texas", "date": "Thursday, July 31, 2014", "text": "What's with the Vaseline, you might ask? Coincident.Haven't written about things happening to me in a while, so here goes... been kinda busy, what with summer session, trying to work through the conveyor belt of my to-do list, going on vacation, and negotiating the terms of my surrender with a rare and lovely bird named Maia from Amarillo, TX.The vacation part involved going with her down to a wedding in Marfa, TX, which is in the Big Bend portion down by Chihuahua. The drive involved a first leg haul from Amarillo to Ft. Davis, where we camped under the stars. And what stars! I haven't seen the Milky Way since Idaho 1975, and it never fails to impress. We were scheduled to attend a viewing party at the Ft. McDonald observatory Friday night, but we got off to late start, arriving around midnight, and so missed it. Maia and I went up to the observatory the next day. Hiking up to the domes, I mentioned I was strangely short of breath, and Maia pointed out we were a mile above sea level, which mitigated my alarm some...Here is my obligatory geek shot of the trip and a more normal shot below with the 107 inch telescope dome in the background...Not my cowboy hat....\"I am here!\"Aferwards, we stopped in Ft. Davis for lunch, where I had one of the better chocolate malts with extra malt I've ever had. Our server was having trouble with our order, and consulted with one of the regular waitresses. I asked what his deal was, was informed he was a foreign exchange student from Poland. He actually turned out to be from Ukraine. I mentioned I spoke Russian once upon a time, and he insisted I try. Surprisingly, I remembered conservational phrases and we actually had a back and forth. I could tell he was tickled with the exchange and left him a big tip. Maia observed our conservation, and said \"Oh honey, you absolutely made his day!\", but, you know, with that charming twang that I could get so used to.I'm glad I could make his day!  One of the great things about being human is how so little effort can bring such great joy.I've always liked the desert, and the high desert of the Trans-Pecos could not have been a better place to be. It's positively springlike with all the flowering plants and tan landscape and purple mountains in every direction. I want to go back and see all the things I didn't see there. Fortunately, rain came through, at one point pounding down like horses' hooves. Fortunately the luxury tent we stayed in at El Cosmico was waterproof.Rain on tent canvas creaking like a sailing ship, but we were fine.Then up to the Carlsbad Caverns, an experience which I would suggest was slightly hallucinatory. Those rock formations deep under the surface look nothing like the dry and simple stalagmites and stalactites we learned about in school. They were - to me - monstrous, fleshy, glistening with fat, scaly, gill covered and warty, living things. They were something out of Lovecraft. But the absolutely most bizarre part of the underground adventure was the snack bar. Here is the modern, fluorescent-lit cafeteria in a pitch black chamber, the cave walls barely lit. The bathrooms were equally weird, stainless steel, tile and porcelain surfaces in a cave tunnel. I couldn't help but think about the storied underground cities built for the nation's elite in preparation of the Apocalypse. All in all, a truly, fantastic magical wonderful time!Back to reality on this past Wednesday in time to close out the summer session. I was informed I should go visit Glen as his condition was worsening. (I've mentioned Glen in prior essay from a year ago. He had been diagnosed with Stage Four lung cancer and several tumors in his brain last May. He underwent chemo and radiation, which bought more than a year, but a month ago he told me he had had enough, and was going into hospice at home. I've tried to make it to the bar with him and the group  from the college when we go out Thursday nights. Normally, this tradition takes a hiatus over the summer, but, considering...So I was informed his condition was worsening, the brain tumors taking their toll, and should visit him while he was still lucid. My former student aide, soon to be graduate student at Wichita State University in Kansas, Scotty, and I headed over last evening.We found Glen on a good day, and he, his wife, and his sister had a very fun time. He was active, alert and engaged, and I can only hope this lasts for awhile.At one point, we were talking about smart phones, and the topic switched to Scotty's thesis. He specualted he might continue the work of his undergrad advisor in sustainable and waste fuels for wood kiln firings. I said \"I know what you need to work on, developing tumbleweeds for fuel. They are a nuisance that should be used for something like that\".Glen Reeser and IScotty came back with \"Other people have smart phones. I have John\". Which got a laugh considering how often people use their plastic pocket brains for memory, or use agents like Siri.Glen quipped \"John, call Katie!\" (Scotty's girlfriend).\"KATIE!\" I mock shouted.It really was wonderful to see Glen sharp and in the groove for a change."},
{"title": "The Maw and the Spew of the Sneetch Machine", "date": "Thursday, July 17, 2014", "text": "I'm guessing that, maybe twenty to fifty years from now, people will look at the current crop of 3D printers as rather quaint old macguffins that, oh, had their uses I suppose, but were superfluous to the greater vision of Processing. Let me get back to you on that.3D printers, as they now are, can extrude more than one type of material, and thus already represent a level of sophistication way beyond the cute little x/y plotter with the extruded thermoplastic pooter. Were I to speculate, I would suggest that the end result will be some type of plasmonic surface or plenum that utilizes quantum teleportation to provide material information, building molecule by molecule, or atom by atom.  No doubt it will be hooked up to, not only the internet of things, but a disintegrator that will supply a matter bank that supplies the printer with pure elemental materials. As such it really will grow what it is that you want. And it will range from laptop size to industrial strength, and in a utopian world, possibly be on street corners, and like a version of Mr. Fusion, will be fed garbage and squirt out consumer items.In any event, I propose that the two ends of the thing be called \"the maw\" and \"the spew\". And that the whole be called a Sneetch Machine (after the Star-On and Star-Off machines that Sylvester McMonkey McBean made available to the Sneetches in Dr. Seuss's The Sneetches and Other Stories).Processing, capitalized, will be what we humans, or post-humans, will be all about. Remember the old canard about political affiliation, where if you go far enough right you go full circle and end up on the left? Well, that's not true, but I suspect it happens when it comes to increasing biological and civilizational complexity.  Given the quasi-fractal aspects of nature, it seems there is a self-similarity of scale.And so, when you move up the technological ladder, with increasing leverage and sophistication of control over the surrounding environs, it gets to a point where an advanced civilization looks a lot like a slime-mold, or a multi-cellular organism, and all it is doing is converting available matter and energy into more suitable habitat and more life. Where all you are doing is taking one order of matter, and Processing it into something more to your liking. The original matrix of organization is destroyed in favor of its new matrix.Of course, with creative destruction, that Maw beckons to the Spew. Just hook up the two ends of the Sneetch Machine, and let her rip!"},
{"title": "It's Going To Be Africa For Quite A While, Stupid", "date": "Wednesday, July 16, 2014", "text": "Adam on the right.I went to dinner with a friend of mine last night. My treat. I ate breakfast for dinner, with two dark beers. He ate meatloaf. His name is Adam Bacon, he is thirty-two years old, an Xray technician, six foot eight inches tall, and scheduled for back surgery today. It was an on-the-job accident moving a morbidly obese old decrepit off the gurney what did his back in. He has had difficulty with the healthcare company fulfilling their promises of adequate care. On the other hand, he has been under a number of strictures involving correct behaviors re: maintaining his injuries, and under surveillance to make sure he is not committing fraud.Meanwhile, the parasitic scumbags who destroyed 40% of the world's economy got bonuses and wrist slaps again this year.Go figure.After dinner, with both of us bloated with potatoes and cheese and meat, it was decided we should walk. Since my car was parked back at the college, near the stadium track, we walked on the track. And in walking and conversing, and this mainly to help Adam dispel anxieties about the back surgery, I just kind of ranted and rambled about any and everything to get his mind off things.We discussed a TV adaptation of Apocalypse Now, set in American suburbia, with the Kurtz family. After a bit, the well-manicured front lawn is littered with body parts and pieces of local pets. It's a comedy, a horror-filled comedy. And in the end, Jack, the neighborhood wants Kurtz dead, but that's who he took his orders from anyway.I also mentioned how Rob Zombie really screwed the pooch. When he made House of 1,000 Corpses, he really fucked up.  What he should have done was by up the Beverly Hillbillies property, and adapted his Corpses screenplay to a murderous backwoods cannibal family that strikes it rich and moves to Beverly Hills. Sheri Moon Zombie would have made a fantastic psychotic Ellie Mae Clampett. Again, it's a comedy. A blood-soaked, gore-filled, all-American red white 'n blue cement pond comedy.Sigh.I talked of another movie I had seen, A Touch of Sin, based upon four real-life events \"based upon random acts of violence\". Of course, that's the description, but the context behind the movie explains there is nothing random at all. If there is one regime that shits it's bed in fear every night, it's the Central Committee of the Communist party of China. Here they are, trying to deal with the scourge of S. Invictus Anglo-American collapse capitalism they have unleashed upon themselves. True, they've got the police suppression machinery in place, but they are desperate, desperate I tell you, to get the consumerist pacification program thoroughly in place before the lid blows. Even if they have to wreck the countryside to do it.I talked of a book I read about conditions in India, called Capitalism: A Ghost Story. If you thought income inequality was bad in America, look to India. In fact, if the trend continues, India is probably America's future.I talked of why Revolution will never come to America.We are all now just too dumb, fat, slow, sloppy and lazy. People are hobbled by debt. People are threatened with it. Police are slowly becoming better at suppressing the locals, with the equipment and tactics in place. People are sated and hypnotized and coddled with consumerist items, and shinies dangled of either gangsta or hipster cool lifestyles. Not just America. It's the Anglo-America Empire that is like that. (Or Orwell's Oceania, if prefer, and I do).Ever wondered why the English never had their revolution, in a time when the rest of Europe was in turmoil? Ever wonder why Great Britain managed that? Look to the last paragraph. Carrots and sticks, but mostly sticks. The means of production (though ever so briefly disrupted) always were under the firm of control of capital. And when the unions threatened to take over? They got bought, suborned, bribed, and rewarded.And if things got a little tense? Just ease up on the reigns a bit, Hoss. If you notice, more than half the energy production and products of Oceania is flushed down the sewer, wasted on nothing. How can we really be in an era of scarcity when we are throwing away more than half of everything, food, product, people, you name it.In S. Invictus capitalism, Scarcity is an invention, to be bogeyman and coins in the seat cushions.So, Americans are very, very unlikely, despite the teatard and Occupy tensions, to ever get all Mad Max, because that would mean no more Cheetos and soft drinks, and Hulu, and smart phones, and actually experiencing bodily discomfort and physical exertion, and people shooting back at you.So, where to look? Because Revolution has left the station, and America is not on that train. Russia? China? India? Brazil? Phhfft!Once again, friends, It's AFRICA stupid. That's where it is all going to go down. In retrospect, Black Empire was almost prophetic, but the problem was Schuyler relied on a ju-jitsu move using the Anglo-American version of capitalism, and that, we now know, that ain't gonna cut it. Not without the resources of the Solar System to subsidize it all.Perhaps more like The Girl in The Road, but not. One thing I think Schuyler got right, it will involve religion, either an existing one, or a syncretic new one."},
{"title": "Normal Accidents : A Book Report", "date": "Monday, July 7, 2014", "text": "J.R. \"Bob\" DobbsNormal Accidents: Living With High Risk Technologies by Charles Perrow. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow prefered the term normal accident, in the sense that for complex systems with tightly coupled components, accidents are normal events. Indeed, he has suggested that some areas of technology and human enterprise are error inducing environments. This is rather similar to Edward Tenner's idea of Why Things Bite Back, the unintended consequences of human technology.Perrow first coined the term \"system accident\" when this book was released in 1984. Since then, much of the examples and analysis in this book has been turned into a field of study known as Normal Accident Theory.I'm going to suggest that, though even the public has come to realize that there is rarely a single cause to a catastrophe, the tendency is still there for the blame to descend to the operator's level, while the architects and designers get off scot free. Witness the financial collapse of 2008, as a prime example, and if that isn't a good argument for mandatory capital punishment for white collar crime, I don't what is.As such, I realize that there are multiple sources for disasters, but still, when it comes down to it, I can't help but shake the feeling that most of them boil down to incompetent management. Incompetent fuckups who think they know what they are doing. When it comes to maritime accidents, one could blame the captains managers, but the error-inducing environment is created and maintained by the owners. These are the people who invariably cut corners to save a buck. And it is not just maritime accidents, it is every single area of human endeavor that involves technology only slightly more advanced than the five simple machines of the ancients.Couple this incompetence with a willful ignorance to evidentiary facts, and you get a modeling system inside that bony carapace of a skull that almost invariably ignores dangers for a more rosy rainbow unicorn assessment of the situation (and who does a better job of that than clueless executives?):\"Why would a ship in a safe passing situation suddenly turn and be impaled by a cargo ship four times its length? For the same reasons the operators of the TMI plant cut back on high pressure injection and uncovered the core. Confronted with ambiguous signals, the safest reality was constructed\".So, this has been addressed in one form or another in the form of increasingly sophisticated risk assessment methods, but Perrow has suggested that some areas (especially, I would note, those that can be automated), might best be abandoned as human pursuits. Nuclear power and weapons being one of them.I disagree, one thing I note is that if any area has had more incompetent monkey clusterfuck accidents with more devastating results, it is the area of nuclear weapons. And yet, if the systems for deploying and maintaining nuclear weapons are highly complex and tightly coupled are accidents waiting to happen, then wouldn't the past 70 years suggest the are not a Great Filter?So, I would quintuple the quality control on bonehead executives, or at least, given their pay has increased some 350% over the past 30 years, subject them to 350 % more scrutiny than they suffered some 30 years ago. Public executives, not so much the problem, as they are already under public scrutiny. It's those private bastards that are going to wreck things for everyone. And so long as they insist on socializing the losses and privatizing the gains, they need to be kept ground under thumb, just to keep the hanky-panky to a minimum.The other obvious choice is to loosen the coupling on the internal components so many of these systems. Tight coupling makes them more efficient, but it also makes them more brittle. Having a little inefficiency is not necessarily a bad thing. As such, the term \"slack\" comes to mind. Though this is considered an ineffable term within the Church of the SubGenius, I now suggest it be incorporated into every single human design element to the end of time.Oh, right, and the accidents detailed in the book are highly amusing, and worth the read."},

Or is it?Thing is, if global warming follows projections, West Texas and the surrounds become even more arid, looking more like the southern neighbor of Chihuahua, and that's doom, right? I mean, a man would have to be kind of crazy to leave the lush plenty of Chicago to live down there, right?Well, that's not really what I wanted to talk about.What I did notice, when I was down there, was I was fed like I was a horse by a lovely desert bird. I mean kind of like a horse. Horses don't eat steak (which of course I had to get seeing as where I was), but I ended getting fed a lot of salads, and fruits, and apples, and carrots, and stuff you give to horses.And not to get too personal with you, but I gotta tell you my poops were pretty damn healthy and spectacular. Me getting away from all the starches and dairy and proteins, and getting more insoluble fibrous stuff, really seemed to get my gut bacteria all nice and happy.So, I decided to do a reevaluation of my dietary intake, seeing as, as I age, I have to pay more attention to my body. And most especially to my gut, which is my ally. My ally is going to help me make it through the Bermuda Triangle of male health, which is your fifth decade of life.I've also decided to look at how I exercise. I'm still exercising like I am seventeen, and I'm not anymore. Some things I won't change. I'm still about strength training, aerobics and running, but I'm starting to include balance and flexibility in the mix.After my I had my unfortunate loss of my left kidney last year, when it turned from a functioning organ into a useless bag of water, I've not quite been able to get into the same shape I was before that all went down.

{"title": "Radiophobia or Radiophilia? Part 2", "date": "Tuesday, June 24, 2014", "text": "Author's Note: Circumstances are conspiring to keep me from finishing this essay. Honestly, the past month, I don't know what the fuck I've gotten done. In any case, clearly I am not going to complete this essay the way I desire, and so, I'm just gonna wing it even more than usual, and let the pieces fall off where they may....^^^Which set of molecules appears to be running the joint? The RNA based ribosome or the DNA strand?This particular essay is nothing but rank speculation. Still, the origins of Earth and Life are lacking in a lot of data, subject to a lot of conjecture, so I don't feel too terrible generating what may be well just-so stories.We deep sea denizens, living at the bottom of an ocean of air, rarely worry about radioactivity. The universe is just a hissing, spitting cat of radioactivity, and, like any playful kitten, loves to kill things just for the fuck of it.Cute playful kitty has all sorts of different claws to accomplish this: EM radiation from UV on up, into the gamma region, but not beyond due to matter/energy interchange; relatively \"harmless\" alpha and beta decay from unstable radionuclides, and, of course, cosmic rays - nearly as fast as speed of light particles ranging from protons up to bare naked uranium nuclei (and maybe even, given relativistic time dilation, the occasional ununseptium nucleus). All of these types are usually brought under the rubric of ionizing radiation. Out in space, beyond low Earth orbit, this ionizing radiation sets a limit of perhaps a three months or so of unshielded human exposure before incapacitation or death.We are sheltered from most space radiation, and a good thing too, but still almost every element beyond hydrogen can be rendered unstable with a good enough whack from a stray neutron, and so we inescapably exist in a ionizing radiation environment. But I'm getting ahead of myself...Let's start at the beginning: 4.537 billion years ago, a proto-Earth formed out of a rapidly accreting disk of dust and gas, orbiting a proto-Sun. About 150 million years later, that proto-Earth, sometimes dubbed Thera, got rear-ended by a Mars-sized object named Theia. It wasn't a big collision, not a t-bone accident, but it was enough to create the Moon. Point being, given we don't have many rocks from the origin of the Earth, Moon rocks - and meteorites - tells us all we know.(It should be noted that, when you look at depictions of the formation of the solar system, they give the wrong impression, the same way that those bathtub-drain renderings of wormholes and black holes, or those whole-lotta-empty-space depictions of neurons and synapses in the brain give the wrong impression. Wormholes and black holes do not look like water going down a bathtub drain, and neurons are packed cheek-to-jowl in a very crowded brain. And so it was with our solar system at the beginning, context is left out, namely the nebula which held the stellar nursery of hundreds or thousands of stars of which our Sun was but one).Again, point being the composition of that cold molecular cloud, at the turbulent compressive front of a spiral arm, determines the type and amount of radionuclides we find on early Earth, and thus, Earth today.And we don't know much about it. We used to think that a supernova must have gone off nearby to collapse the cloud destined to become the solar system. Now, we think not. (Although, to explain the ratio of aluminum 26 to magnesium 26, perhaps a supernova went off within our stellar nursery some half a billion years before the solar system formed).We thought that we had identified the cluster of stars we came from. We were wrong. The nearby nebula that astronomers considered a candidate would have had to have flung the sun out with such force that all the planets would have been stripped away.Lately, there is news that perhaps we have found a sibling star from that distant stellar nursery. If so, then the origin point of our cluster of stars could be anywhere, maybe even on the other side of the galaxy. Maybe someday we can create a \"galactic genome\" map of all stellar origins using elemental and orbital dynamics data, in which case we might find the origin point of the sun's birth, but in the meantime, we have only conjecture.Regardless, here's what we can suppose about the conditions for life on the early Earth with respect to radiation. So long as the Sun was contained in the stellar cluster, the solar system would have been bombarded with intense ultraviolet radiation from massive hot blue stars. Earth, in turn, received copious amounts of UV from the young Sun as well. Couple this with a massive amount of unstable actinides (heavy elements in the uranium on up range - including naturally occurring plutonium) and you have an extremely hazardous and unlikely environment in which Life formed and thrived. There was, in fact, so much goddamned radioactivity that it's a wonder anything managed to hold together.But here is something interesting, and not entirely coincidental about damage from ionizing radiation, Life uses the same repair mechanisms to cope with it as it does for oxygenation. Oxygen getting in where it isn't supposed to be create free radicals and superoxides, both types of compounds extremely obnoxious and unsuitable for cellular metabolism. Oxygen is almost as bad as it's next-door neighbors chlorine and fluorine. When cosmic rays, or suitably high energy EM radiation, tears into molecules and cellular structure like microscopic 50 caliber machine guns, it creates conditions similar to oxygen poisoning.Coincidence? Maybe, but consider that most radionuclides do not form water soluble compounds in a reducing atmosphere as the early Earth supposedly had. But oxygenated water and air, even only locally, sets up ideal conditions for fission reactions to naturally occur.Oxygen also produces ozone, which cuts back on deadly UV radiation. So, we have competing threats to life, nuclear radiation, and UV radiation. Life came up with a strategy for the latter in the form of melanin, an ancient and honorable molecule. So, what about the strategy for ionizing radiation?It is interesting to note that some 3.87 billions years ago, DNA became the standard format for information storage. It is hard not to imagine RNA coopting and regulating proteins in the environment before then, but DNA has a fidelity of information transmission that RNA envies. Oh, true, information replication via RNa is quite robust, but the signal to noise ratio is much lower than for the more fragile DNA format.So, what gives? What made DNA the preferred medium of transmission? My guess is, all the little cellular machineries needed a lot less physical error checking algorithms for DNA than RNA, and that extra metabolic energies could be devoted to other things, and so organisms using DNA got a bump up in the ratings. That's one part of guess...But! What else happened around 3.87 billion years ago, class? Could it be the Late Heavy Bombardment? Why, yes. Yes it was. But the heavy bombardment may not have been nearly as heavy as planetary scars suggest. And further, the proposed mechanism - the scattering of Kuiper belt objects and a shift of Neptune's orbit further out due to resonance between Jupiter and Saturn - could have been a symptom of something else going on.My wild speculation is the bombardment, and the migration of planets in our solar system, was the result of the baby Sun finally leaving its birth nebula, perhaps assisted by the passing of a nearby star or stars. Further, those stars that surrounded the early solar system were the older big blue stars that formed first within the nebula. The intense UV radiation flux from these stars is finally gone, and DNA, which readily absorbs UVB radiation, gets a break from that. It still has to deal with ionizing radiation, and the mechanisms for that must wait until sufficient oxygen accumulates for oxygenation coping strategies to develop. Unless... the oxygenation coping strategies are based upon some older metabolic tricks from the Hadean or early Archean lifestyle, in which case we are back to life thriving under very intense radiation conditions.Well, there you go, not quite the essay I wanted, but it will have to do.(Oh, the white people are vampires thing from the Part 1 essay? That was a sloppy inference based upon the fact that animals with less pigmentation seem to thrive better in radioactively contaminated environments.)"},

We stopped at a bar/restaurant in Riggins, ID. When we walked in, all heads turned to look at us and talk stopped. It really was like the Wild West, and all that was missing was for a piano player to stop playing. Well, small town, and everyone was probably there for lunch so e=mc squared, strangers in town. They all checked us out, wrote us off as campers and went back to eating.Interesting thing. We were all long hair and jeans and baseball caps and tennis shoes. And they were all  cowboy boots and cowboy hats, or John Deere caps, and sidearm pistols, all of them what today would be called open carry. And we Hoosier boys didn't think much of it, except for that fact that we stood out and probably should get some guns. One thing sure as hell didn't cross our minds was \"Are we safe? Is there a spree killer here that's gonna blast us?\"So, what's happened since 1975? I think a lot of it has to do with the increasing militancy of the NRA. And now, they've created a monster. They wanted to look all reasonable and responsible, and instead, every dumbass who pulls this gunplay shit tars them with their own brush. Oh, boo-hoo, and but I don't how they will unpaint themselves out of this corner.Especially considering their contention that only a good guy with a gun is so laughably proven wrong with each new incident. The tiny-brained dumbasses of the right wing press refuse to acknowledge the fact that most spree killers are either killed or disarmed by professional law enforcement agents, rather than wannabe Batman vigilantes. In fact, soon after the kid with pepper spray took down the Seattle shooter, the dipshits at the squamous skin cell network tried to spin a story of a deputy sheriff taking out some maniac into a #goodguywithagun story. I mean, the perps name was Marx, there on a drug related charge, so he had to be a leftist, correct? Oh, so sorry, right-wingers, he was one of yours. In fact, the one armed person at the Gabby Giffords shooting (the shooter by the way disarmed by UNARMED bystanders) was smart enough to not go for his gun, otherwise he would have shot the hero who disarmed the maniac. And yet, dipshits would rather jack-off to a gun fantasy that real life refuses to provide them.Gee willikers, what if Abe Lincoln had had a gun? Shut the fuck up.The thing that worries me is now the rhetoric has shifted so that these creeps wish to paint any of their fellow Americans who disagrees with their brittle worldview as not really an American citizen. It's to the point where Rand Paul has to spread his legs for the Texas GOP (proving once again that the Senate, though not the oldest whorehouse in DC, is still the biggest) with a joke that was supposed to be funny, but still reflected an underlying and ongoing message that he (and other creeps) does not recognize certain of his fellow Americans as REAL Americans. ...and therefore (this coming from a guy who claims to respect the Constitution) do not enjoy the same constitutional rights as REAL Americans, which, you know, means when push comes to shove means Rand will probably shoot them.But you know what? Fuck Rand Paul and his allegedly unserious divisive comments, I'm thinking now about the Andy Griffith Show. Remember how Andy was a sheriff without a gun, and it was Barney Fife with his single bullet who was the object of ridicule? And actually it was only until the show had gone to color and jumped the shark that they brought up the whole sheriff without a gun angle anyway.Point being that there were firearms in the Mayberry courthouse tucked away in a gun cabinet, and Andy did occasionally pack heat, but for 99% of the problems he encountered, Sheriff Andy Taylor did not need to solve them with a gun! This whole 2A solution bullshit was crazy talk back then.Hell, he even got shot at by the likes of various mountain folk, and still didn't arm himself or shoot back because \"didn't know it was me, and likely didn't mean it none\".Or, as Andy put it in one episode: \"When a man carries a gun all the time, the respect he's getting might really be fear. So I don't carry a gun, because I don't want the people of Mayberry to fear a gun. I'd rather they respect me\".Nowadays there are far too many pipsqueak Barney Fifes swaggering around in America, and not enough Andy Taylors."},

You enjoy the right to keep and bear arms, and dress up and play Army, and plink at cans and bottles, and pretend that someday you might get to play cop... all that right costs you is the occasional mass slaughter of cute little children.The NRA, which for the most part represents gun manufacturers rather than gun owners, has managed to so water-down the laws and and hobble the agencies that are supposed to control firearms, so much so that no new REAL gun safety legislation has not been passed since the Great Depression. (And for those of you who say gun control laws don't work, remind me of the last time someone used a Class 3 destructive device in a killing spree).Gun manufacturers understand that a gun purchase is an infrequent one, and therefore have more or less adopted the same marketing strategy that toy manufacturers use.An armed society is a polite society? Why then, the south side of Chicago, where practically everyone is armed, where you can find guns littering the place, must be one of the safest, and most polite places on the face of the Earth! And what do gun bronies say about this? Well, thugs aren't supposed to have guns! Sounds kind of racist doesn't it? I mean these armed citizens only become thugs once they shoot someone, and before that they are good guys with guns, right? Why doesn't anyone stand up for their 2nd Amendment rights? Could it be because they aren't white?Me personally? I'd say I can't really buy into the argument of self-defense. I mean, if you are wearing a holstered gun to church, you are going to the wrong church. If you are wearing a gun to the store, you are just going through an infantile Batman vigilante fantasy. And I got news for you, you ain't no Batman. But if we go with the idea of preparation, of self-defense, then I can justify owning perhaps four guns. And that by decreasing range, rifle... maybe semi-auto, shotgun, revolver. Long gun for distance, shotgun for intermediate, revolver for up close and personal.Anything beyond that is Gun Barbie Accessorizing.You don't think it's all just boys and their toys?

{"title": "Radiophobia, or Radiophilia?", "date": "Thursday, May 15, 2014", "text": "Belatedly, Happy Mother's Day, Edward Teller... and he was a mother.I've been having a hard time finding time to write an essay on some things nuclear (and still haven't really). The best I can do is perhaps produce a old lazy river meandering all over an ancient flat plain, with lots of oxbow lakes and sandbars. A river does go someplace, and I would like to think there is a direction to what threatens to be a series of essays. So here is an My Attention Conservation Notice: Life Figured Out How To Handle Radiation a Long, Long, Long, Long Time Ago --- or  --- Wow, Maybe White People Really Are Vampires! (In Which case, I'd Get To Killing Them Off Pronto If I Were You)!Some people suggested Teller was immortalized as part of the amalgamated archetype Dr. Strangelove in the eponymous movie. Peter Sellers always maintained Dr. Strangelove was based upon former SS officer Werner Von Braun (rehabilitated via Project Paperclip), along with RAND Corporation strategist Herman (\"On Thermonuclear War\") Kahn, mathematician Johnny von Neumann, with the accent borrowed from Stanley Kubrik's Austrian photography consultant Weegee.(Kahn was characterized by possible psychopath General Curtis LeMay, along with all those defense eggheads brought in by JFK, as one of those \"pipe-smoking, tree-full-of-owls types who had never served and never seen combat\". LeMay had a point. Kahn pushed for limited war, and Lemay knew the concept was absurd. If you don't fight to win, you shouldn't fight at all, and Lemay was always for counterforce strategy targeting enemy offensive capabilities).So, Teller was the Mother of the Hydrogen Bomb. Many call him the Father, but I think of him as a mother - in more ways than one - as he carried the thing to term.If you want a baby daddy for the H-bomb, go seek out  Stanislaw Ulam. (Had Teller been used as a source character for Dr. Strangelove, Bela Lugosi would have been more appropriate, but Bela had already died). In which case, it might have a vampire movie about the end of the world. Which would be sad, as vampires rely on human prey, and therefore would prefer more and healthier humans being around, rather than less and sickly.Population explosion, anyone?Okay, point being here what? Or is this going to be rambling commentary on the unthinkable?I've been ruminating, reading through old books and new, on nuclear fission, nuclear weapons, the nuclear industry, and the biological effects of ionizing radiation. One thing I found interesting is there is evidence that radiation in small amounts is - not necessarily beneficial - but perhaps appears to be beneficial. I explored this somewhat in an essay called The Spa Treatment Mystery. I would like to expand on that, and all this stuff percolating in my brain for the past month has given me a hunch that there is a slippery eel of a gestalt that I've seen glimpses of through the murk and the mire.Or not.But your patience will be required in order for me to sneak up on this slippery eel, and from different directions. This may lead to something, but through a whole forest of false analogies, rather like deriving the correct numerical solution with the wrong equation or the wrong computational model (which happens more often than you would think). Random Items to Get Started:Dr. Strangelove may have been a satire, but pretty much every aspect of the movie was true. Nuclear fission, and more specifically, Leo Szilard's nucleonic reactor, moved from proof-of-concept to industrial-sized production model in just under 90 days. 90 days. I doubt you can point to many technological endeavors with such a short development time. And the continued development of nuclear weapons probably rivals or surpasses Moore's Law.In fact, the prediction of Moore's Law, the integrated circuit and semiconductor industry, would never have come to pass without the heavy subsidies from the Defense Department in pursuit of optimizing nuclear fighting. The entire consumer market of computer/electronic/entertainment would not exist without this initial computerization of war (paid for US government taxpayers, and Internet Libertarians may at this point grind all appropriate gears).About one pound of coal gets you one kilowatt hour of electricity (as does one thousand cubic feet of natural gas, or one and a quarter cups of oil). One pound of uranium gets you seven million kilowatt hours. If you were born between 1951 and 1958, you are a fallout baby. Meaning you were conceived, gestated, born and raised in a sea of poisonous radioactive atmospheric fallout. And yet, the incidence for cancers and birth defects for this group of people is practically indistinguishable from any others.  Last year, I was injected with a small amount of radioactive technicium (Tc-99m) and put under a gamma ray scanner. To my amazement, an image of my right kidney appeared on the screen, looking rather like a night image of the Earth, with little towns and cities all lit up. As for my left kidney? It was looking like North Korea at night - nothing. Tc-99m has a half life of six hours, and so, had I gone ot the airport, I would have been mistaken for one of those mythical yet-to-be-seen dirty bombs that Homeland Security is always looking for.Interesting how many Los Alamos scientists switched over from bombs to biology at the end of WWII. Nuclear science had matured and looked for another field with the potential for world-changing breakthroughs: molecular biology. Radioisotopes were invaluable for the study of metabolic pathways.From 1945 onwards, some 2,349 nuclear tests have been conducted worldwide - 528 of exploded in the atmosphere. An estimated 629 megatons of explosives have been set off, and some tens of millions of curies of radiation have been released to the environment, so much so, that the equivalent of World War III has been fought over a 70 year period. Had the same amount of fallout been the product of Orion nuclear rockets, mankind would enjoy a solar system wide empire today. Bartender, canned ape for everyone!In addition, from 1951 to 1992, some four thousand radiation experiments were conducted by the AEC, the CIA, the DoD, the CDC, the NIH, the VA, and NASA on (for the most part uninformed) ha subjects. As documented by Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Eileen Welsome:\"hospital patients at New York's Sloan-Kettering, Cincinnati's General, Houston's Baylor College, and San Francisco's University of California were fully irradiated to produce military data; eight hundred pregnant women were dosed with radioactive iron and their fetuses monitored by Vanderbilt University; seven newborns and over a hundred Native Americans were injected with radioactive iodine; seventy-three mentally disabled children were fed radioactive cereal by Quaker Oats and the AEC; two hundred cancer patients were dosed with enormous amounts of cesium and cobalt ; and 232 inmates had their testicles irradiated at carcinogenic levels by the University of Washington. The prisoners were paid a hundred bucks and sterilized at the end of the experiment to 'keep from contaminating the general population with radiation-induced mutants'. Around two hundred of Nevada's explosions directly irradiated over two hundred thousand site witnesses, most of them servicemen, while around ninety atmospheric demolitions afflicted thousands who would be known as 'downwinders' - resident of Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah.\" - The Age of Radiance, Craig NelsonThose are what we know of. There are undoubtedly as many or more cases of radioactive exposure that we do not know of. Every single nation that has pursued nuclear fission has had some type of accident. The US Navy, and the Soviets, have dumped literally thousands of tons of radioactive waste pretty much wherever they wanted into the oceans. The Soviets were so lax in their waste disposal it's almost a surprise their former territories are not luminous. And a dirty little secret in Japan is that most nuclear industry workers are the yakuza. Nuclear waste disposal there is handled accordingly. And the surprising thing is, after all the meltdowns, atmospheric tests, and industrial accidents, and irresponsible waste disposal involving radioactive materials, statistically and empirically, this has globally added perhaps only some 13,000 additional cases of cancer and birth deformities to the current load. In fact, there is evidence that low level exposure to radiation creates metabolic adaptations to survive - and thrive - in even higher radiation environments.My take?  Well, I don't think the Marvel Comics plan of producing superheroes through mutation was ever considered, but I do think there has been an active plan to get us all used to living with radioactive contamination. Toughening the Breed.Paranoia? Maybe... more later."},

I'm starting to think you don't appreciate me\".  That's the extended caption that came into my head as I looked at the latest bronze, The Caretakers.Yeah, it's finally done. I dicked around on this far too long. Fact is, I did learn some things this time out. The last bronzes, The Stockmen, which I rushed through production in order to submit them for a show they did not get in, had severe casting defects on the figures. These were corrected with proper feed runners. Almost corrected. The figures still had shrinkage porosity defects, aka \"sucks\", which I will take care of next time.\"sucks\" in the same spot on both figuresBut the Caretaker bugs were not vented properly. They ended up with some pretty severe gas porosity defects.This has resulted in a new rule with the acronym ABV.Gas Porosity from lack of ventsAlways Be Venting.The other big problems with casting, and ones that I should avoid and usually do, is turbulence and oxide inclusions.This is all about skimming the bronze of shit before pouring, and proper rigging. Proper rigging meaning the obvious like, lots of runner and vents, but more importantly, I've found from experience to avoid right angles and make the rigging more organic and treelike or arterial*, so that a common sprue acts like a manifold and feeds everything rapidly and uniformly.Surprisingly, or not so, some fluid dynamic studies back up my intuitive hunches and empirical observations: http://phys.org/news/2014-04-common-junction-pipes-particles-materials.htmlSo, one of these days, I may actually have a defect free casting... through luck. Here are some other pics of The Caretakers:*Actually, I try and follow an old empirical law of circulation, in determining how many smaller diameter runners feed off a larger one, so that the number of runners needed is the sum of the cube of radius of the larger runner. In other words, the spherical volumes that can be fed from a smaller diameter runner tube sums up to the spherical volume of the larger runner tube."},
{"title": "The Aurignacian Efflorescence", "date": "Tuesday, April 29, 2014", "text": "I've joked about how my mother's father's side of the family were Neanderthals, but no, they were just ugly anatomically modern humans. Although it is true that most of us have about 1-4% Neanderthal genes. Svante Pääbo (pronounced PEH-boo, if you really want to know), who has sequenced the Neanderthal genome, has an interesting observation. We tend to think that modern humans were dominant over Neanderthals, as they are now extinct. But the gene flow evidence suggest from Neanderthals to humans. This type of gene flow is seen where one social group is dominant over another, and that the dominant group fathers children that remain with the non-dominant group. Examples are white slave owners in the Americas, and British colonials in South Asia, passing their genes into a population they control.The evidence is not conclusive for this, but let's run with it. So, prior to what are known as \"replacement humans\" making a migration out of Africa some 75-50,000 years ago, a first wave of anatomical humans shared the Middle East with Neanderthals, and the Neanderthals enslaved, or at least intimidated, that first wave of humans. The question you might ask is, who are these replacement humans, and why were the first wave humans not dominant? And the answer is found in the archaeological evidence. The stone tools in use by both Neanderthals and first wave humans were identical and unchanged for hundreds of thousands of years, kind of indicating a similar and static set of cultural tools as well. Given an equal tool kit, the physically more powerful Neanderthals probably had an advantage (see Gods versus Titans myths from all over the world). But then, starting with the late Mousterian tool kit, and progressing into the Aurignacian tool kit, humans using these tools start to occupy sites where Neanderthal tools existed. Neanderthals start to disappear.Keep in mind, the Aurignacian stone tools are much more various and sophisticated, and are associated with the so-called Cultural Big Bang, when the first cave art, animal figurines, and probably rope, twine, and textile objects appear (base on the prevalence of fine bladed flint, bone needle, and fish hook tools).This Aurignacian Efflorescence really took off in a big way, and practically every habitable surface of the Earth was populated in a few short millennia. Many suggest this cultural sophistication was the result of language.Oh, bullshit. There is plenty of anatomical evidence to suggest language predated the Aurignacian Efflorescence by several hundred thousand years. So, what did it? Genetics? Hardly.My answer? Bows and arrows. And a peculiar form of psychopathy that exists to this day, perhaps best made manifest through our habit of genocide. We ape versions of solenopsis invicta, armed with our projectile stings, swarmed out of Africa to conquer the world."},

I was proud of the fact that I came up with a pickup that used a cantilevered pickup shelf using drawer slides underneath so you didn't need to buy high temperature rollers like what they use in glass lehrs.Building the pickup kiln got me interested in gas kilns and burners and furnaces, and I decided to make a propane-powered version of a vitrigraph.Reason I did that was vitrigraphs are electric kilns raised above the ground with a hole in the bottom of them for soft glass to stream out of, and since they are electric there is the risk of a shock. So, that would not be problem with propane-powered one. So, I built a series of them, and finally ended up with what was called the Stringinator Mark II.Now, at first I just used the kiln to make thin pieces of stringer, where you put scrap color glass into a flower pot and then heat it up to flow out quickly and make thin strings of glass. But then I decided to see if I could make cane, and I could. It was kind of a pain in the ass, because I had to crouch in an uncomfortable position on the floor. Looking up into the bottom of the kiln played Hob with my neck, but  I'd grab the nubbin of glass coming out of the flower pot with tongs, and then as you pull the glass slowly down, it would cool enough you could grab it with your bare fingers. (\"Cool enough\" being a relative term. My calloused fingers tips didn't seem to mind that it burned a little).So then, I would twist the glass to make candy cane type of stuff, and then really rapidly twist the two-colored glass to make what I called \"supertwisties\". So, then I got bored with making helices, and would stop twisting the cane one way, and start twisting it the other way, and make what are called hemihelices.So, then I got into a regular pattern of twist one way, stop, twist the other way, stop, back to twisting the first way, etc. I don't have any pictures of the glass vases or bottles that used these alternating supertwisties for surface patterns. A number of renters really liked them. But the interesting pattern, when these canes got spread out from the heat and getting blown larger I had no name for.But now I know there is name for them. A hemihelix with multiple perversions: http://phys.org/news/2014-04-hemihelix-scientists-rubber-bands.htmlI'll see if any of the renters can find a picture of this pattern.Update: Couldn't find the glass.

One was to build this really big solar paraboloid, like 40 feet across with the focal concentration power of a couple hundred thousand suns, and position it so that it would focus the sun just twice a year. Then, on say, spring and fall equinox, you would put a hot dog or something, in the focal point, and watch it vaporize and/or explode.Another idea I had was to purchase a series of shredders and chippers and dust makers and take, say, an automobile, and reduce it to as fine a dust as I could. And then package it. A can of Rolls Royce tickle your fancy?The problem with both these schemes is I lacked the capital to do it. Both of these schemes are competely feasible, they merely require monies.A while ago a friend/acquaintance was going to work on an intelligent kiln. It would keep track of all sorts of stuff going on inside it. At the time, I said, well, what really want in order to that is a whole bunch of wireless sensors that report on all the little volumes inside the kiln, and so it would be really the intelligent object inside the kiln that guided how the kiln would fire it. But in order for that to happen, sophisticated electronic devices would have to be built that could take the heat. And as far as I knew at the time, no one was working on that.And now I find out about plasmonic metamaterials, and the potential, should they take the technology in its logical course, for refractory electronic devices.  And actually, given the huge amount of waste hear we as a society produce, thermionic electronics make even more sense.People are looking for carbon-neutral energy sources, when we could be using all that waste energy!What do you think?"},

I know others have already made fun of Charles Koch, but I want a swipe at him as well. And then there are those stooges who know how to lick this goon's boot nice and clean, like Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, who read the entirety of his boss's editorial on the Senate floor.Come to think of it, I wonder if April 2nd is April Fool's Day for rich people? You know, like Boxing Day is after Christmas? It would make a whole lot more sense, because then, after Koch goes about wrapping himself up in the flag about caring about your liberties, he could have said, \"Nah. April Fool's! I don't give a shit about you little people who weren't thoughtful and resourceful enough to inherit wealth. FUCK Y'ALL!\"A new study came out confirming what we all knew: the United States of America is an oligarchy.Actually, I'm guessing one thousand years from now, future historians will go further, and observe the American experiment was one of the greatest criminal enterprises ever (because, you know, no one got punished).There is pretty solid empirical evidence that monied interests have controlled public policy from day 1, not to mention the system set up by the Founding Fathers has a substantial status quo bias. And so it makes Koch's editorial all the more dishonest, and the general complaint of rich goons and their stooges that government doesn't work rather disingenuous. (Rather a self-fulfilling prophecy given that they are controlling public policy).Which means either Koch is delusional in the way authoritarians are (it is not enough that I fuck with you, you must love and respect me for it), or is just cynically fucking with us regular folk while he and his Thurston Howell III cronies laugh over drinks at the club about it. Either way, we get fucked, and the op-ed is such a transparently infantile little whine that my first impulse is to say to Koch \"I'll give you something to cry about\"!And given that conditions are about the same, or worse, as when Franklin Roosevelt gathered his generation of oligarchs together and told them that public sentiment demanded they make concessions, else find themselves hung upside-down with their severed genitals stuffed in their mouths, perhaps it is time for the current crop of rich goons to reevaluate things.Oh, right, and the New Yorker has a fascinating article out about extreme spelunkers."},
{"title": "Coulda Woulda Shoulda", "date": "Thursday, April 3, 2014", "text": "In a different reality, on or around this date, April 3rd, 2014, 8 million tons of a city-sized Super Orion ship would have reached Alpha Centauri.That's leaving Earth in 1961, accelerating to 10% of the speed of light, with turnaround and deceleration occurring about a tenth of a light year out from Alpha C, is pretty close to an arrival in 2014. What they find is dead rock and gas giants, but then, with 1960s life-support technology, the chance of anyone arriving alive is pretty slim, so a ghost ship traveling to a dead world sounds appropriate.And, if we launch the sucker from Earth's surface, we've added only about the fallout of a 40 megaton bomb to the ecosphere's burden. But keep in mind, 1961 was kind of a banner year for nuclear fallout. The US of A conducted (officially) 1,054 nuclear bomb tests that year. That's the equivalent of 3 per day. Not to be outdone the Sovietski Soyuz set off the Tsar Bomb, all 50 megatons worth.The next year, 1962, the US of A tried out a little canal digging with the 104 kiloton Sedan test.The test was a success in digging out a crater, which I guess they had doubts about, but the resulting fallout, some 880,000 curies of radioactive iodine-131, rained down particularly heavily on three counties in Iowa. The fact that we have no reliable data on the effects has a lot to do with the annoying habit of Americans not to stick in one place. On the other hand, Sedan, and Dirty Harry got nothing on Chernobyl, with some 3 billion curies of iodine-131 released over the ten days it burned.Chernobyl could not have been more poorly thought out. You've got the worst of two behaviors involved, a material that loves to burn used as the neutron moderator (graphite), and a material that loves to explode (as steam) as the coolant (pressurized water). As an added bonus, a large swimming pool of water was placed underneath the reactor core, so that large chunks of red hot graphite and radionuclides could fall into it and flash steam the water into 1603 times it's original volume in milliseconds.  The bioshield that separated the naked reactor core from the sky was an 8 foot thick piece of concrete. When the core blew, the explosion flipped that giant concrete plug like a coin, and it didn't come down heads.In a different reality, we probably could have had a Chernobyl as early as the Napoleonic era. Ever heard of plumbago? Being a metals guy, I was first made aware of the term in the 7th grade, when I first sand cast pot metal in shop class. The term comes from the Plumbago mine in Seathwaite, Borrowdale, Lake District of the UK. Good solid British graphite was used to produce plutonium in the Windscale site.The really amazing thing is just how frigging primitive an atomic pile is. Pure graphite surrounding natural uranium ore straight out of the ground gets you an atomic pile. (Why, natural reactors existed before humans). Given that natural uranium ore exists in Cornwall, and was in fact mined in the South Terras Mine, one can imagine a set of circumstances that resulted in a British atomic pile as early as 1789, when uranium was discovered.Could a fission bomb haver been produced before 1944? Well, if you know what your about, a gun type uranium bomb could be produced from one of those old gunpowder Turkish cannons, circa 1465. All of the required technologies existed as early as 1870, but, no probably not. After all, the atomic theory wasn't really taken seriously until 1905, and I sincerely doubt raw empiricism itself could have gotten to an a-bomb.Just as well, don't you think?"},
{"title": "In the Garden of the Melonheads", "date": "Wednesday, April 2, 2014", "text": "Once, I wrote up a design description about steampunk, dieselpunk, and rocketpunk. Here's a further explication.Steampunk is what you get when Science reaches the end of knowledge circa 1899 or so. I know most people imagine zeppelins and goggles and top hats with clocks in them when they think steampunk, but I would prefer to think of the state of scientific knowledge and energy source.Steampunk design is stuck with coal or wood as its energy source.Dieselpunk adds gasoline and oil.Rocketpunk includes nuclear fission.Here's the thing I got to wonder about. Through simple extended and aggregated monkey empiricism, humanity was using technologies not at all theoretically understood. Wootz steel, for example, was being manufactured in large quantity centuries, or perhaps millennia, before modern materials sciences in the 1930s quantified the exact properties that made the steel desirably functional.Why didn't the Romans have steam power and railroads? They certainly had the ability to build high pressure vessels out of bronze or even iron, and most of the principles utilized by Oliver Evans and Richard Tevithick were understood by the ancients. So why not?Why didn't James Watt power his stationary steam engine with an atomic pile? Some old-fashioned curiosity, coupled with good British graphite and natural thorium ore, should have resulted in a nice house-sized fission reactor in or around Manchester.Clearly, the answer was, they hadn't figured it out yet, or, if they had, they didn't need it. Respectively, muscle (slave and animal), wind and water power, or wood and coal power, were sufficient for the Romans and English. But still... once you see how easy it is to make this shit....Still and all, I'm glad I don't live in a steampunk or dieselpunk world, or at least, not entirely. We still do, as evidenced by all the soot, and dirt, and pollution, and fucking up of our water supplies. Give me a rocketpunk world, in fact, give me a world populated with a specific kind of breeder reactors, and I really don't have a problem with that at all. I really don't."},
{"title": "Atomic Accidents: A Book Report", "date": "Monday, March 24, 2014", "text": "Atomic Accidents: A History of Nuclear Meltdowns and Disasters: From the Ozarks to Fukushima by James Mahaffey. Short review? Read this book. When I saw this book at the library, and saw the title, I said \"How can I NOT read this book?\"I was not disappointed. Not only is Mr. Mahaffey superbly informative (holds my record for dog-eared pages), he does with a deadpan irony drenched sense of humor found mainly in the military and the parched Permian hills of West Texas. For a nonstop recounting of nuclear horrors, this is one of the funniest books I've ever read. How good of a book is it? I would probably consider adding to my personal library.I wish I could quote all of the (invisibly) underlined passages within the dog-eared pages, but why spoil the book for you? (A sidebar here: I think it extremely rude to underline lines in a book that is not mine, and I also take pains to unfold all of the dog-eared pages. I respect books and treat them accordingly).I would make two observations, perhaps three. The first is: it is a wonderful thing that we human creatures are such a primitive, savage and superstitious lot, believing in unseen influences and malevolent forces, invisible curses and evil spirits, witches and spells and ghosts and spooks, otherwise the planet would be a lot more blighted with radioactive debris than it is. This is not to say some of us haven't been cavalier around the stuff, but reading about how often meltdowns and spills happen... just be glad the industry was a little concerned about its public image.My second observation is that almost every incident listed in the book is a case of Thinking Fast and Slow. Or rather, engaged in far too much clever monkey fast thinking to fix immediate problems (and thus making the situation worse), and not nearly enough slow fore-brained thinking on coming up with more sober solutions. I would go further, and suggest that this fast and slow thinking could be extended to the cultural level; for the fast, clever version of cultural ruminations has given us the industry we have today, which is not necessarily the right way we should have gone about this. The mid-20th century saw a kind of mad rush to get things going, the public was ready since the beginning of the 20th century for a solution to the energy crisis (yes, they realized back then that oil and coal wouldn't last forever) and there were two priorities to all this 1) make nuclear weapons, and a distant 2) make power for electricity.The reactor of choice ended up being something that can make plutonium, and uses pressurized steam power. Problem is using water to moderate and cool reactors, and pressurized steam leads to steam explosions. Steam explosions... usually bad. Steam explosions with radioactive fissile materials... usually worse. The logic would suggest, therefore: nuclear power bad. (Well, no not actually, unless of course, it is allowed to rest in the clumsy paws of those drunken dancing bears known as the Russians... more on that in a minute).Let me start from the rear of the book and point out that Mr. Mahaffey is solidly behind thorium reactors, either the molten salt variety or the liquid fluoride variety. It really is only a matter of time before we head that way because, let's face it kiddies, fission is here to stay. The beauty with thorium is the reactors can't melt down because they start out molten, and the waste is so much easier to process. (I don't include you can't make bombs with a thorium reactor, because you can make bombs with U233, it's just not very practical).This is not to say that nuclear waste is, in any sense, really waste. The United States is the only country that does not process it's nuclear waste, and as a result, we plan on burying a huge amount recoverable fuel and valuable radionuclides - not to mention that gold mine known as plutonium. (There will come a day when, if we make it out to the outer Solar System, we are very much going to want to have all that plutonium to run thermoelectric power packs).Mr. Mahaffey makes the case that we have fallen into the Rickover Trap. A small, almost toylike reactor used in nuclear submarines is safe, efficient, and easy to operate (the reactor control panel is no more complicated than the dashboard of a private jet). It is a wonderful nuclear reactor in the megawatt range. The problem is when you take this thing and turn it a gigawatt mountain, with a control room that is packed with dials and gauges packed floor to ceiling for dozens of feet, and with a nuclear core that is basically delicate lacework and feather puffs that would melt faster than a gallium spoon in warm tea, it's a wonder we don't have more accidents.  (Again, more on reactor cores in a minute). So, this is a case of immediate problem solving through design freeze far too early in the process just to get the dang things out the door, of fast thinking overriding slow.Okay let's get to good stuff. The big one, the Mother Of All Clusterfucks: Chernobyl. Let me preface this big doozy with quick summary of what the Brits did to get their bomb. The British built a large graphite pile in dairy land of Cumbria on the northwestern coast of England. It was called Windscale, and it's sole purpose was to produce plutonium for bombs. Due to passage of congressional security measures, the Americans were not allowed to tell them what to do. But in 1952, a visiting American delegation looks over the pile, and informed the Brits: \"Whatever you do, do not let the graphite catch fire.  Once it gets going, water will not extinguish the fire. It will only burn hotter, as graphite pulls oxygen out of the water and leaves you with explosive hydrogen.\" (I leave it to the reader as to figure out how the Americans knew this).On or about Oct. 8, 1957, the Windscale graphite pile caught fire. They flooded the pile with water. The lazy red flames turned blowtorch blue. Finally, someone turned off blowers that were providing positive pressure - and fresh oxygen - to the core, and almost instantly the fire went out. It was a total loss.\"Over 10 tons of uranium was melted and five tons were burned. Very little of the uranium  or even fission products went up the chimney. A brittle oxide crust had formed in the extreme heat of the fire, and the heavy oxides were bogged down in it before they made it to the air outlet. The immediate concern was the volatile fission product iodine-131. The filter packs (in the chimneys), now no longer known as \"Cockcroft's follies\", were not expected to capture any of the 70,000 curies of iodine-131 that were present in the fuel when the fire began, but there was a fortuitous happening. The LM cartridges, containing bismuth oxide meant to activate into polonium-210, burned up, and the light bismuth oxide dust went up the stack and caught in the filters. This and some vaporized lead reacted chemically with the iodine\".Some 20,000 curies of iodine-131 were released upon the dairy farms of Cumbria, and the government had to buy a lot of milk. Luck of the British. But still, the problem had been the insistence of maximum production of plutonium had overworked the pile to the point that it burned down. Management was never held to account.But, buck up readers, at Chernobyl, management died in agony from radiation poisoning a few days after the accident. So there's that to be cheerful about.An observation about the Russians, though it is true that every other nation that has worked with nuclear materials has had more than their fair share of sheer folly, the Russians have to win hands down as the true brutish and crude barbarians of the industry. If there is anything, anything, bad that can happen or go wrong with anything nuclear, not only have the Russians done it, they've practically dared, goaded, and bullied each other to do it, like a fucking drinking contest or something.Have you heard of the Kyshtym disaster? That was the world's first, and so far biggest, dirty bomb. A large underground tank farm near Chelyabinsk was built to hold plutonium extract in solution. A cooling-water pipe to one of the tanks broke, and rather than find the leak and repair it, the engineers in charge just turned the water off and forgot about it.The tank heated up, the nitrate solution degraded into ammonium nitrate mixed with acetates. The water all boiled away and the now solidified ANFO, mixed with radionuclides, exploded with the power of 100 tons of TNT. 70 to 80 tons of radioactive waste was blown out in a plume covering some 200 miles long. (Didn't I tell you this was a funny book?)And Chernobyl? That was what happens when you put the Austro-Hungarian Empire in charge of a safety test. You might as well just say \"Klink, you idiot!\". Here's a great passage: \"Two men, Protosov, a maintenance worker, and Pustovoit, who was the \"odd-job\" man at the plant, were night-fishing on the bank of the coolant runoff pond, right where the plant outflow occurs, 1.25 miles from the plant. The fish really liked the warm water, and it was a clear, starry night. It seemed like the middle of the summer, and the fish were cooperating. They turned to look when they heard two low rumbling explosions, seeming to come from inside the plant. Then a third explosion reduced the top of the building to flaming splinters, and they watched with mild interest as steel beams and concrete chunks spun overhead. The turbine hall burst into flames and illumined an enormous column of black smoke. They turned back to their fishing rods. If they got excited every time something around here exploded or burned to the ground, they would never get any fishing done. 'They'll have that out in no time', opined Pustovoit. Whenever a steam relief valve popped off, which seemed quite often, it sounded like a Tupolev Tu-95 strategic bomber had crashed into the side of the building, and fires consuming switch yards or fuel depots were not rare at the Chernobyl plant\".   The tragedy of Chernobyl is that there is no lesson to learn here. Criminal incompetence and bullying on the part of the plant director, Akimov, played a role, but the plant was so poorly and wretchedly designed, that, well, unless rhesus monkeys decide to build a plutonium production plant, they may be the only ones to learn anything from this.I could go on, but why spoil the book for you?Alright how about this quote, because it applies to TMI and Fukushima:\"In major commercial reactor accidents, there always seems to be a single operator action that starts the downward spiral into irrevocable disaster.\"That's Newman's Maxim: \"No subsequent amount of steps will fix a profoundly fucked-up first step\".How is that different form any other industrial accident, or financial transaction, or political movement? Trying to solve the immediate problem, or trying to keep losses at a minimum, almost invariably invites the much, much worse problems behind it to step forward.My thirds observation is that perhaps we've been going about it the wrong way. Chernobyl, right before it exploded, produced near 30 billion watts of power, and my suspicion is, rather than avoiding meltdowns, the most efficient way to use nuclear power is to encourage building reactors that like melting down, and that only work in a molten state. After all, you get the most efficiencies from the big temperature differences. The thorium reactors mentioned earlier like being in a molten state. Perhaps what we should be doing is investigating and developing refractory instruments, materials, sensors and processors that shrug off 2-3,000 , maybe even 5,000F degree temperatures. Maybe we should be building nuclear volcano reactors to get the most steam power out of them. It certainly couldn't be worse than what we've accomplished so far."},

It was pretty evident, especially after Krushchev's revelations that central planning was doomed in the Soviet Union. So long as everything was misrepresented, so long as there were no accurate and reliable feedback mechanisms, central planning simply could not work. (It is one of the reasons the free market system is so robust under graft, deceit, and corruption: the misrepresentation is distributed, and for the most part, the suckers eat the losses).Soviet citizens, therefore, knew they were being lied to constantly, and as a result developed an amazing talent for reading between the lines. Gleaning even a glimmer of the truth from misrepresentation and distractions, in a way that even the most cynical and suspicious Americans cannot not hope to equal, is an admirable quality, one that served them well when dealing with deceptions from the United States government. (That and having an espionage system second to none in the world kind of explains, well, the hysteresis of the crumbling empire).So, the lesson is, if you were asking for one, is that when information is withheld or constrained, misinformation rushes in to fill the space. You end up, not with a void empty of information, but a great deal of bullshit.  The Pew Research Center quizzed some folks about what they thought digital life would be like in 2025. They got the usual bullshit about how people will be better connected, better informed, more empathetic and helpful, more empowered and egalitarian, and all that pollyanna-ish rainbow-brite unicorn sweetness and light, but, I don't know. I kind of doubt it.Last year, it was reported that robots constitute 61.5% of internet traffic, and 69% of that bot traffic was malicious. I don't see that trend going down. Criminals, parasites, scammers, spoofers, identity thieves, bitcoin robbers, have only just now started to take advantage of the internet.

{"title": "The Shaking of the Keys", "date": "Wednesday, March 19, 2014", "text": "When I was a kid, my father worked as a salesman for a magnet factory. We had a big box of magnets out in the garage that were samples and souvenirs from the factory. I can remember the cow magnets, which were long rounded rods you would get a cow to swallow, and then all the hardware the cow managed to chew up would collect around the magnet. We would try and see how how many cow magnets you could get to stick together in a chain when you pulled them out of the box.That actually isn't as exciting as it sounds.But we did get some big ring magnets one time. I discovered that, if you put a magnet up on the TV screen it would distort the picture. And I tried out the ring magnet on our brand new color TV and the things it did to the picture was wild! Of course, once I took the ring magnet off, the picture stayed all distorted, and needless to say, I freaked. I tried turning the TV on and off, but it no difference. So, I just turned it off and hoped that no one would notice. Fortunately for me, whatever happened inside the TV fixed itself, as the next night when it was turned on, it was normal.I'm not sure I can say the same for my brain. I would regularly run magnets over my skull, knowing my brain was electromagnetic, and figured some kind of weird experience would occur. But it never, or at least, not so I could notice.Nowadays, you can hack you brain in a much more sophisticated manner with DIY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, or the recent Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation. I knew a guy, maybe a decade ago on a metal casting forum, who was going to experiment with it. In fact, his last post on the forum was how he was all set up and going to try and it and looking forward to the experience, and he would be back after the weekend to tell us all about it.... and that was his last post ever.Doesn't mean anything bad happened to him. Maybe he entered an alternate reality and saw no need to come back.Speaking of alternate realities, word is that another deranged billionaire  - Ken Langone - thinks his situation is the same as the victims of the Holocaust, where he and his fellow fat-cats are the poor, persecuted Jews, and all of us consumers, the people who bought all his shitty stuff from his shitty store, are the Nazis.Ken and his fellow oh-so-put-upon billionairesYou know, I really have to wonder why someone doesn't just slap into some form of cognition that soggy bowl of oatmeal sloshing around in Ken Langone's wrinkly old noggin. Maybe that is not possible.  One thing I do know, is that it makes for press, and I've got to wonder if that is really what it is all about. It's the shaking of the keys, distracting the dumb rubes and yokels of this country from the actual problems by creating issues for them to worry about.  Remember when Dick Nixon shredded the 4th amendment with the Drug Wars by getting white America all worried about crime and drugs? Even though both were trending down by the time he got all his draconian legislation passed?Remember how the billionaires got the teatards all worked up about the Debt? Got them all hooked on goldbuggery and the fragility of the dollar? Even though gold - at it's highest price EVER - was outperformed in the markets by that promise of future labor and ingenuity which we know as debt?Ever notice how, after the Newtown massacre, the NRA and the hobby arms industry (supplying the big toys to big boys) distracted everyone with the mental health issue? Even though the mentally ill are the least likely to be violent? And in fact, a much better indicator of violent actions is alcohol abuse?Ever notice how, when rich people get rich, it really has nothing at all to do with the people who actually do all the work? Notice that those people, who shoulder all of the risks, in that they have their life's earnings, or a significant chunk of it, dedicated to making the project or innovation or enterprise happen rish FAR MORE than the venture capitalist who basically throws down pocket change and risks essentially nothing in comparison. And notice where all the rewards go? Notice all the talk about free markets, and people who suffer from platonic derangement syndrome whine about it's not really a real free market, even though government supports and sustains the market? Even though, the people who complain over the internet about all this, fail to see how their entire modern lifestyle would not exist without the galaxy of first rate national laboratories and federal subsidies fund innovative companies, and then we just give it all away for free?Nobody notices this shit?"},

In 1913? In 1813? In 1713? No point on going beyond.\"I have to assume that drunk and stoned Johnny was asking, not what a military organization of 1000 people can do, but rather, what endeavor, what adventure, what amazing thing can a collection of one thousand (randomly chose or selected? it's makes a difference)  people do in a month's time?It's a good question.I ignore the military answer because that's fairly obvious. I think I was thinking in terms of the acceleration, the... anomaly we've gone through these past 300 years, what with science and technology and such. Because, before the Industrial Revolution, there was only incremental change, and accomplishments made in 1712 - with muscle power and ancient machines - isn't much different than the preceding millennia.So, what can one thousand carefully chosen people do in one month's time? In 2013? In 1913? In 1813?No, I'm asking you!Well, here's one thing. Clearly, the choice of the one thousand matters, but the whole support structure of humanity behind them matters more.Here's an example. Today, I was trying to think of this guy who wrote a mind-blasting science fiction story I read in 1977. I couldn't think of his name. and I couldn't think of the title of the short story. All I remembered was this guy was English, that he specialized in space opera, that he had pulpish tendencies, and the one line from the story \"galaxies whizzing by like snowflakes\".So, at first I figured I'd read the story in one of Harlan Ellison's Dangerous Visions anthologies.TO THE INTERNET!Ah, see, let's stop for a second. How many people, and how many months, are behind that particular activity I am going to do? All the programmers, and engineers, and technicians, and physicists, and phone company types, and fabricators, and typists, and coal miners, and metal extractors, etc., etc. etc.?In 1913? In 1813? One hundred years ago, I'd have to go to many libraries, talk to many librarians, to get this information. And 1813 would not be that different, would it? Hell, one hundred years? The Web is now twenty-five years old, so, in 1989?Okay, start to get the picture? So, I look through the authors of Again, Dangerous Visions, and one pops out as a candidate: M John Harrison.Was that the guy? No, that was not the guy, but contained in the wikipedia article was the guy: Barrington J. Bayley, and the title of the story was \"The Cabinet of Oliver Naylor\".Bayley once said he was heavily influenced by reading The Naked Lunch, which, by coincidence, I also read that summer concurrently with above mentioned short story.And so now you know why I make shit like this:\"The Caretakers\" wax, to be cast in bronze, kind of hard to see but the left figure's mask looks like the bug she is holding\"The Caretakers\" wax, to be cast in bronze\"The Caretakers\" wax, to be cast in bronzeMy bronze class is currently investing their pieces, and, as I just got done today with the waxes and still have to rig them up for casting, puts me four days behind my class, which makes me a remedial learner."},

{"title": "Terms Of Venery", "date": "Wednesday, March 5, 2014", "text": "You know what that is, even if you don't: collective nouns, like \"a pride of lions\", or \"a kine of cows\", or \"a troup of shrimp\", which is the title of this new wall piece (2014, cast glass, mahogany frame):\"A Troup of Shrimp\" Can two shrimp be a troup? Well, they're gonna have to be.Speaking of terms of venery, there are modern forms, and soon to be obsolete modern forms, such as \"a discourse of fax machines\". And there are terms for groups of people as well, such as \"a slew of assassins\" or \"an odium of politicians\".I think there should be a term for non-commissioned officers. More specifically, chief petty officers (or simply chiefs), or staff sergeants or gunnery sergeants, or sergeant majors. In business, they are usually called managers, but since the corporate model is based upon a hierarchal military organization, it is much the same (although business usually looks more like a joint civilian clusterfuck that makes money despite itself rather than a force to be reckoned with).As the son of a Navy guy, I'll go with the example of chiefs. I thought perhaps \"a network of chiefs\" might work, but really it is more like \"a quantum entanglement of chiefs\", or perhaps \"a superimposition of chiefs\".It is true that the people who really run things are the non-comms, the people who keep the butthead executives away from the workers. More importantly, if something needs to get done outside of the chain of command, there is a, well, almost like a spacelike Newtonian plane of existence cutting across all light cones that is the known as the chief's network. When some problem of either a staff personal nature or situational nature is there, this rather impossibly instantaneous communication system goes into effect and suddenly distant parts of the universe are in contact and taking care of things.I never really thought about it, as I don't really think of myself a s a chief, but apparently, given some introspection on the matter, I guess I am. Not necessarily in keeping butt-head executives away from the workers (although, come to think of it, that's what most of my jobs have been), but rather connecting with others to make sure shit gets done and people are taken care of.So, I may or may not be part of that, but if I am, then so, dear reader, are you! Because, in a strictly relativity-obeying acausal fashion, this is what we do. And doesn't that sound better than being a passive purveyor and container of selfish memes? Given that I don't buy into that shit, I think so.So, hello, chief! How you doing today?I'm doing good. So, apparently are some other Americans, who are the beneficiaries of the ACA (you know, Obamacare). According to the Wall Street Journal (although give the editorial staff a moment so they can spin a denial of this new tidbit), the ACA has boosted household spending and income for January.   Well, you looking at one household right here. And what did I do with my extra disposable income? Why, I went and bought myself a toy. A Kaossilator Pro Plus, to be exact.And it is a HUGE amount of fun. I have literally, like a six year old boy, played myself to sleep with the thing. And woke up with bent headphones. Take that, Rush Limbaugh!Okay, here you go, my test track with the Kaossilator:"},
{"title": "The Spa Treatment Mystery", "date": "Monday, March 3, 2014", "text": "I am currently reading a book, Atomic Accidents: A History of Nuclear Meltdowns and Disasters: From the Ozark Mountains To Fukushima by James Mahaffey, which I will do a book report on eventually.In the meantime, I'm fascinated by descriptions of mineral water treatments and spa baths. Mineral water and hot spring spa baths typically are considered invigorating and healthful, but why so?Water percolating though rocks almost invariably has some quantity of radioactive particles in it, or at the very least, is bubbling with radon gas, and so you would think it would not be good for you. And yet, the waters and spas are considered curative by all cultures. The world still has many curative radium spring resorts, from Hot Springs, AK to Misasa, Japan which hosts an annual Marie Curie festival to honor the discoverer of radium.It is a known fact that people's reactions to radioactivity varies widely, with some being highly susceptible to even the slightest exposures, while others seem to have an advanced immunity. One would have to assume, given the extent of life on Earth, with exposure to all kinds of ionizing radiations and actinides in our environment, that there are molecular coping strategies, but could some forms of metabolism temporarily thrive on increased radioactivity? Could it be that there are some individuals who would benefit from a little bit of exposure?The prevailing attitude has been that there is no good amount of exposure, and yet, a rather dubious flirtation with all things radioactive going back at least one hundred years suggests that this is not so.Consider the insane ignorance expressed by the early pioneers, such as the Curies, Roentgen, and even Nikola Tesla. Tesla routinely stuck his head into his 4 million volt x-ray, finally only stopping after experiencing shooting pains towards the top of his head, and recommending that kids not try this at home. For the longest time, x-ray technicians would waved their hands in the beams to check for operational efficacy. After many incidents, the practice was quickly abandoned.And then there is the ingestion of curative radium waters. Much information is now available about the Radium Girls, but the practice actually didn't gain much press until doctors killed Eben Byers, a wealthy heir to a ironmonger's fortune. The lesson here? If you must kill people for profit, make sure they are poor. A more succinct lesson: Don't kill rich people for profit.Radium is chemically identical to calcium, is readily incorporated into bone, and no metabolic mechanism exists to remove it from the body. Interestingly, Dr. William Bailey, the entrepreneur who marketed Radithor, the radium water ingested by Byers, protested an FTC false advertising complaint, stating \"I have drunk more radium water than any man alive, and I have never suffered any ill effect\".He wasn't kidding. The emanations from his disinterred remains swamped a geiger counter:\"William Bailey, the entrepreneur who killed Eben Byers, had ripened to the age of 64 when he died of bladder cancer unrelated to radium in 1949. Twenty years later, his remains were disinterred for study by Professor Robley D. Evans, Director Emeritus of the Radioactivity Center at MIT. A count of radioactivity lingering in his bones proved that that Bailey wasn't lying when he claimed to have ingested more Radithor than anyone else. Yet, he had never complained of a toothache, much less died from it. Decades of study suggested that the effects of large radiation loads vary from individual to individual. Can some people tolerate chronic high radiation better than others? Are certain people better at producing protective hormones such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and the interleukins, stimulating the growth of blood cells under radioactive stress?\"And if some people can, well, not thrive and improve, at least tolerate higher levels of radiation, should they be studied or recruited for - if and when the time ever comes - \"hazard duty\" of one form or another?"},

{"title": "Jobs Report", "date": "Wednesday, February 26, 2014", "text": "I really enjoy Bruce Sterling's blog on Wired, Beyond the Beyond. He has a way of succinctly connecting future dots that I envy, both for brevity, and relative ranking of trend/surprise importance, and also finds fun stuff that highlights the more unusual in trivial matters.Atlantic Cities has the BLS's projected-10-years-out jobs report, and nifty maps to go with it.(Provided, of course, the electrically-powered robots don't take over every job from us food-powered robots, as has been threatened by various magazines, expect growth in service industries and what they call now \"creative class\" jobs. I for one do not value a job changing old people's diapers in Arizona, but I suppose that's where it is all heading.But still, my suspicion is one government agency is not sharing data with another (what? really? that happens?), as some of the regions projected for growth seem unreasonable and/or unsustainable.So, the Southwest to boom with jobs? Really? Anyone notice that don't have any fucking water? And ain't gonna have no more water if things continue? Because the pattern, which, yes, can shift, tends towards everything getting increasingly arid west of the Mississippi.  Throw in a little sea level rise, and all those jobs projected for southwest Florida and the Gulf coast of Texas kind of head underwater.So, it's early, and 2024 is still a far distant future to me.Speaking of which, does anyone think ITER is going to be up and running by then?There's an article in the New Yorker that shows just how daunting that task is, even when you throw in the old science joke of \"As always, fusion is only thirty years away\". But here is a task that is challenging even materials standards. From the article:Depending on whom you talk to, the history of the central solenoid epitomizes either iter’s flaws or its ability to overcome them. From the start, the magnet’s technical requirements indicated that it would be extremely difficult to build. To prevent the solenoid from launching through the roof, a thousand and eighty screws must be fixed to the top and the bottom, to keep the stack in viselike compression. Moreover, niobium-3-tin is difficult to work with. It does not attain its superconducting properties until it is baked: cables made with strands of it must be coiled into a module, then heated for days in a custom-made furnace flooded with argon gas. The strands, each one less than a millimetre thick, are interwoven with copper. In the furnace, the metals bind into a fragile matrix that later cannot be flexed.“The challenge for the central solenoid is that it has to ramp up every time you do a plasma shot, which is thousands of times during the lifetime of the machine—so you have to create a superconducting cable that can pulse tens of thousands of times without degrading, and that is very hard with niobium-3-tin,” an engineer who worked on the magnet told me. “It is a brittle material. How is it not going to become dust? With each pulse, you are literally breaking it, micro-fracturing it. So what is the solution? Don’t pulse so many times, or pulse with less energy. But you cannot do either. If you pulse with less energy, then you don’t get the heating that you need, and if you pulse fewer times then the life of the machine is shorter. So you are pushing up against the limit of what the material can do.”Why even during the Manhattan Project, which, other than a certain amount of sheer dumb luck in casting the right allotrope of fissile plutonium, enigneers and physicists encountered no few materials issues. It was strictly a matter of engineering finesse.My guess is, it will be considered a success, even though it is a monumental failure. But there is hope, and I suspect the rescue of fusion will come from a clever application of metamaterials."},

{"title": "Trivial Life Stuff", "date": "Wednesday, February 19, 2014", "text": "I'm sure I'll talk about this later in the year, but over the weekend my brother informed me that, as of July 23rd, I will be older than Dad when he died. I asked him if he was trying to jinx me.My dad died of a heart attack at age 57. Each of his children is going to view their 57th year with a hairy eye ball. I think me less so than my other brothers. They are built more like Dad, who looked like a Mongolian wrestler.I take after my maternal grandfather, who was more wiry. And actually, given that my mother's side of the family, the Norwegian hill people, are probably half troll and or half ogre (which is to say, Neanderthal), I'm surprised grandpa was as skinny and wiry as he was.You'd figure, with all that Neanderthal blood, he'd be a thick-boned knuckle dragger. But he, and I, had/have these wimpy looking wrists and ankles. I say wimpy looking, because, well, as far as I know, no one on that side of the family, going back generations, has ever broken a bone, and it's not from lack of trying. Maybe we had some fleet-footed long distance runners, skiers, and rowers in our Viking past, and the ones that broke bones were left on the shores of England and Ireland, to face the wrath of the natives.And let's not forget Dad's side of the family; natural athletes all, and preternaturally muscular. My uncles scared me when I was a child. I learned long ago not to wrestle with any of my brothers. That was a guaranteed defeat. Instead, hit hard and run was the name of my game.In any case, it doesn't mean a damn thing when it comes to heart health. I haven't had myself checked out for any of that stuff. My brothers have, so, and they all got great hearts and clean vascular systems. So what do you think? Modern medicine? Modern diet? My father, like many of his generation, basically lived bird suet and sugar, smoked and drank like they were ethically bound to make way for the next generation as soon as possible, and had to raise little assholes like me, which had be to high stress.Overheard once: \"You worry about keeping them alive until age 12, and then after that, you worry they don't kill anybody\".I understand. Teaching kids in the 18 to 28 range, I know now how my Dad felt about me: DUMB-ASS!It takes some time for the last part of brain to grow into the front part of the skull, usually no sooner than the age of 25, and in a lot of people, it just never does.In any case, what with my health problems over the past year, I ended up getting soft and fat, and even for the first time in my life, developed a belly.I'm not vain, or at least, not vain enough to worry overmuch about trying to regain the body of my youth, but I did decide to try and get back to some semblance of fighting trim. I don't have the time to get back in that kind of shape, and I've noticed that people in their 50s that do manage to do that, get an alligator belly and all, they look weird. It's like their meat is a little gamy and coarse. The skin, obviously, is not the elastic and supple thing it once was, and draped over these artificially worked up muscles, like Hollywood youth-obsessed freaks, it just looks weird.So imagine how it snuck up on me with no small amount of pleasure when I noticed my pants are falling off my hips, and, oh, nice, I had to cinch the belt in a notch. Pretty good, considering I still weigh the same.So! That fat turned to muscle, yes? And here's the thing, I haven't even gotten into spring and summer mode when I always got a little bit more time to get a lot fitter, which I use. Becuase it's more than looks, it's feeling good, it's being in shape to do my job, it's being in shape so that, when I need to, I can go from cruising speed to ramming speed.You know what I think it was? I used to eat ice cream every night. Not a lot, not even a dish, but enough. I cut back on that. I give myself an ice cream treat no more than once/twice on the weekend.Now, I'm going to get all unrealistic. I can stay fit, but entropy is eventually going to win. No reason not to keep trying, though."},
{"title": "This One Weird Amendment Can Stave Off Tyranny...", "date": "Monday, February 17, 2014", "text": "So, lately, every slippery little flipper-limbed jellyhead squirts out a stain over the 2nd amendment and gun rights.Hey, you know I would like to see a poster of, all the time, for gun rights? The NRA should be required to use this poster:You know who should be the patron saints of gun rights? Bobby Seale and Huey Newton. The NRA should pay monies for statues of them in front of their national headquarters. You want to see real Americans actually using real gun rights? I can't think of a better example. Not those doughy poodles that show up at teatard rallies. Those guys are just a fucking joke.You know why they are a joke? The 1932 Bonus Army March. That's why they are a joke. Let me tell what would happen if teatards ever decided to \"exercise their 2nd amendment option\"? George S. Patton:Information:As in all military operations, information is vital. By the use of detectives, soldiers in civilian clothes, and friendly citizens, get all possible information about the condition within the city. In particular, locate on a map the position of public utilities, banks, commercial districts, residential districts, armories, sporting goods stores, and other places of importance. Also the general focal points of the disturbance and the names of the leaders. It may be desirable to fly over the city to become oriented. If fired upon while in the air, reply at once with small bombs and machine gun fire.From the information secured, arrange your axis of approach so as to drive the mob into the poor quarter and away from vital areas.Weapons:The use of gas is paramount. It may be used by hand grenades with a range of 25 yards, rifle grenades with a range of 250 yards, or bombs and stokes mortars. While tear gas is effective, it should be backed up with vomiting gas.Although white phosphorus is incendiary, it is useful in forming a screen for the attack of barricades and defended houses.Next in order of importance come the saber, the bayonet, and the club. In the case of dismounted troops, do not close in on a mob with the bayonet or club if you are largely outnumbered. If the mob refuses to disperse, give them a fixed time, perhaps five minutes. Call the minutes so they can hear. If they are unheeding, lob some gas into the rear of the crowd at exactly the end of the period. If this fails to move them, open fire with one man per squad for a frontal attack while at the same time have men in houses shoot into the rear ranks selecting apparent leaders. Always fire for effect. Due to over shooting of the battle sight at short range, caution the men to fire at the knees of the crowd. If it is necessary to use machine guns, aim at their feet. If you must fire, DO A GOOD JOB. A few casualties become martyrs; a large number becomes an object lesson.With mounted men even small numbers may charge with impunity with the saber. At first use the flat side, but if real resistance occurs, use the point and try for lethal effect near the belt line. Never allow a man to be pulled from his horse. If this happens, use pistols and give a GOOD lesson.Artillery fire may be used against barricades or defended buildings or with shrapnel cut at zero to clear streets in really serious fighting.Tactics:In general, never halt, except to give warning with a time limit and act instantly at the end of the period specified. Never permit a mob to gain a success. Should they do so, make instant and vigorous reprisals. When a mob starts to move, keep it on the run but always leave it a line of retreat; a cornered rat will fight desperately, while on the other hand, movement to the rear engenders panic.In an attack, move first against the flanks via side streets using cavalry. While this action is in progress, start a rear attack also with cavalry but don't push it home. Finally, make the frontal attack.Tanks are useful against barricades or for forcing doors of houses but they must be closely supported by infantry as they can be rushed and destroyed by gasoline. Such a success encourages a mob.Street Formations:In moving to the scene of trouble, secure guides and avoid poor or disaffected quarters. Use security detachments with reduced distance.As you get close to the enemy, send two squads along each side walk. The first man looks to the front, the second in file looks to the opposite side of the street. The third man is responsible for doors and windows on the first floor on his side of the street. The fourth man watches second story openings on the opposite side of the street. The remaining men watch upper stories and roofs on the opposite sides of the street. When reaching a cross street, look down the street and then get the leading squads across. When the main body arrives, send a squad down the side street one block to prevent flank fire while the main body is crossing. This squad rejoins the rear of the column, hence, should be detailed from the rear company.If an enemy is met in a street, deploy completely across the street in close order and direct him to fall back, unless he is in equal or smaller numbers, in which case keep moving and use the bayonet to encourage his retreat. If they are running, a few good wounds in the buttocks will encourage them. If they resist, they must be killed.As stated above, the frontal attack should follow flanking and rear operations.If the enemy occupies a park or square, use normal methods of attack with emphasis on flanks and rear.If he is barricaded, the effect of modern rifle fire is so great that he can usually be shot out of the barricade with direct fire, aided by gas and offensive grenades. In the face of very serious resistance, and lacking artillery, it may be necessary to use roof detachments paralleling the head of the column along the roofs. Firemen, if available, should accompany these detachments with ladders and breaching equipment. It may be necessary to fight down to the street through the houses on the flanks of the obstacle. In such operations, gas dropped down stair wells is effective.In any operation keep a strongly formed reserve and if the need arises, use it ruthlessly.On The Defensive:When guarding buildings, mark a \"DEAD\" line and announce clearly that those who cross it will be killed. be sure to kill the first one who tries to cross it and to LEAVE HIM THERE to encourage the others.\"Do you think any of those overweight slobbermouths stand a chance against the 21st century version of George S. Patton, especially now, when the civil police forces are so militarized and formidable, that they make the 1932 US Army forces look like a bunch of skinny little kids with squirt guns?All this time, those in power have been shaking the keys known as \"threat to the 2nd amendment\", when they've pretty much left the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 8th in tatters. And it happened long before 9/11. Nixon started it with the War on Drugs. Reagan added to it. Both of them did their level best to destroy the 4th amendment.Problem was, the people most affected by it weren't all those soft white poodles who are worried about \"tyranny\".Interestingly, the one amendment that might prove the most valuable is the 3rd. Remember that one? That's the one everyone scratches their head over: \"No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.\"As has been pointed out by some legal scholars, this is based upon the Castle Doctrine, a man's home is his castle. We're not a police state... yet. But it may be the symbolism behind the 3rd amendment that staves it off."},

He already doubled down. You do it again, it's quadruple. Anyone want to see Tom go exponential? Give him time.Interestingly, Scott Adams, who is Dilbert, defended Perkins in a rant posing as rational analysis back in January. The gist was Perkins has identified a distressing trend against the rich. It's worth a giggle reading it, in that it is the essence of irony: rhetoric barely approaching anything rational, but presented as such.Dilbert says:\"Keep in mind that Perkins got rich by identifying trends before others recognized them. His firm invested in AOL, Amazon.com, Citrix, Compaq, Electronic Arts, Genentech, Geron, Google, Intuit, Netscape, Sun, Symantic and more. So if you disagree with Perkins' assessment of the risk, please compare your success rate to his.\"Wow, I think this is a complex logical fallacy: red herring, false equivalence, and post hoc ergo propter hoc. Probably more if I thought about it, which I won't.Red Herring: He's has some success at gambling. So fucking what? Thousands of springbok antelopes in Africa have a better track record, and that's the ultimate gamble with life and death. Why even the most pusillanimous creature that crawls on the Earth, or slinks through slimy seas, has done better than Perkins trend-wise. So, should we listen to the antelope? ...and you don't suppose Perkins was ever privy to insider information, starting out there at HP, and therefore maybe had an edge in trend watching?False equivalence: Success in one of area of life transfers automatically to all areas? Wisdom in one discipline transfers to all areas? If so, then book me Einstein for my gall bladder surgery, or Warren Buffet for my lawn care advice.Post hoc ergo propter hoc: Come, come, Dilbert. Do I even really need to walk you through this one? False cause?You know what, fuck Dilbert. He admits he is a dick, and if we add the qualifier ignorant in front, we are pretty much done with him.But Perkins as miraculously inerrant self-made man who's every word should be unquestioningly lapped up, like some child's turd dropped in a doggy dish? He just appeared fully formed out of the shining void with all powers and talents intact? Credit where credit is due, I never deny intelligence and hard work  for success, but LUCK, luck and circumstance, and social position, have to be accounted for as well.I've been through this before, but, where did all the money come from? Hmm? The very taxpayers and progressive policies that created the basic science R&D, and all the engineers and technicians that made Perkins, and a lot of others in Silicon Valley, rich.Because if you are going to talk about Perkins and Silicon Valley, then you have to talk about Hewlett-Packard, Stanford U, MIT, and massive government subsidies from the Defense Dep. And if you have to talk about Silicon Valley, then you got to talk about Fred Terman.\"Fred Terman was the founder of Silicon Valley, if any single person can be given credit for it. He was one of the most successful American administrators of science, engineering, and higher education in the 20th century. He made the Stanford engineering department one of the best in the country and laid the foundations that would make Stanford one of the world’s preeminent research universities. He single-handedly created the university, government, private industry partnership model that still characterizes Silicon Valley in the twenty-first century. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were two of Terman’s favorite engineering students, and certainly his most successful protégés. They left behind a Global Fortune 50 company that in 2010 sold products around the world (it is Silicon Valley’s largest corporation by revenues) and multiple multi-billion dollar charitable foundations.The history of the three is best combined, as is the partnership of Stanford University with the federal government and private industry; the Hewlett Packard Corporation (HP) provides the best example. Their friendship and admiration for each other was genuine. David Packard showed it at Terman’s Memorial Service in January 1983, in Stanford California, when he mentioned knowing Terman for more than 50 years. Packard said he enjoyed Terman’s “friendship and benefited in many ways and on many occasions from his council, his advice, and his wisdom. . . Fred Terman was an engineer’s engineer.” Terman was unique in that he loved technical theory but also loved to build useful products and companies, to see practical things get done.[6]  Bill Hewlett showed the depth of his affection after hearing of his best friend Packard’s death in a March morning in 1996. Another friend came by to pay his condolences. The friend went into the kitchen and saw Hewlett sitting on his wheelchair by a table in the breakfast nook. Hewlett was staring into the distance; his staff watched him sitting there from the early morning into the afternoon hours, with a deep and sad look on his face.[7]The HP history is an admirable one of two close friends building a multinational company which during their lives was one of the world’s most admired companies for both its profit growth and its employee-oriented culture. Fred Terman Settles in CaliforniaIn 1905 the Terman family moved to Southern California from the Midwest, as Terman’s father needed the warm climate to get over tuberculosis. Terman’s father took a Stanford Education School professorship in 1910, and so the family moved to the place where Fred Terman would both grow up and die. Terman went to Palo Alto High School just as Federal Telegraph Corp. (funded by Stanford President David Starr Jordan) became a major radio company in Palo Alto.Federal Telegraph is important for both the Valley and Terman. Cy Elwell‘s company convinced the inventor Lee DeForest to leave the East Coast and come to Palo Alto to be his Chief Scientist. DeForest created the electronic amplifier (found in so many electronics devices today), but was still being persecuted and had even been sent to jail for stock fraud charges for a previously failed New York startup.  Elwell had to post bail, and California was a much more amenable place to work for a risky electronics venture. Federal Telegraph went on to have the first intercontinental radio broadcast in 1919 (Annapolis Maryland to Bordeaux France) and was one of the major radio manufacturing companies in the US. Alas, the glamour of Federal Telegraph didn’t last, as it slowly faded around a handful of products till Marconi acquired it in 1931 (two entrepreneurial employees left to found Magnavox).Federal Telegraph was doubly important because all the neighborhood techie kids became amateur radio enthusiasts, hanging around Federal Telegraph’s labs. In fact, ham radio may have been the first Silicon Valley boom, with its low cost of entry and simple technology, and hence accessibility to a large group of technical-minded people. The inspiration of radio never left Terman – environment was destiny in his case.\"Do I need to talk about Fred Terman? I just gave you the link, but, come on, without Terman building up Stanford's School of Engineering, and without HP taking a rather progressive attitude (due in no small part by Terman's influence) of \"share the company’s prosperity with workers\" (SOCIALISM!), Perkins could have just as easily been some nobody jerkoff. And no one would care if he violated Godwin's Law."},
{"title": "Redemption in Indigo: A Book Report", "date": "Monday, February 10, 2014", "text": "As a recently mutated milk-drinking portion of humanity known as caucasian, I've noted that, on really drab, wet, grey, overcast, awful days, possibly with a heavy mist or light rain, I am in the best of moods. Can this be because I come from the northern region of the planet? Is this some kind of \"race memory\" thing? (I should note, you know, that I really am a Northern Barbarian, have the genetic test results to back it up, at least on the exclusively paternal branch... and the family records show great-grandpa emigrated from Prussia. And that region enjoys a northern maritime climate, a moderate blend of warm summers and mild cloudy winters).Or am I just suited by personality to this type of day? Or is there something else?I not only enjoy these kinds of grey, drab days, I actually thrive on them. Sunny days, yes, awesome, but as a highlight, a diversion, as dessert but not as regular fare. But I've also noticed it's a early spring/late fall mood. There's got to be a cheery spot of green someplace around in the picture to evoke this mood, and so I wonder if it's just a fond memory of childhood?Some positive reinforcement happened that spiked this visual memory with a good mood?  I think it might be that. And if it is that, I think I have to chalk to Ursula K. Le Guin's book A Wizard of Earthsea. I'm pretty sure it was early spring when I read that book, and the notion stuck in my head that the protagonist's home enjoyed a northern maritime climate. So, there was the evocation of that world, but also the characters who were, mostly likeable, but mainly real. Maybe the first characters that I as a Young Adult, had first encountered. Inspired by a Senegalese folktale, Redemption in Indigo by Karen Lord, I would classify as young adult fiction. It's sophisticated enough for adults, has adult ideas in it, but is a good introduction for young adults for adult thinking. Lord, has a knack for depicting characters that are well-rounded and enjoyable. I derived, for lack of a better word, a certain delight in the depiction of the undying ones - not so much spirits as creatures outside of time and space. They were more archetypes than characters, I think.In all, even though it was set, not quite in our world, but a close enough world, and primarily in the dry savanna landscape of Senegal, it still evoked that warm visual memory I get from those grey, drab, overcast late spring days.A fun little repast of a book."},
{"title": "The Peculiar Diorama", "date": "Friday, February 7, 2014", "text": "When I documented \"The Stockmen\" to submit to shows, I didn't submit the entire scenario as I saw it. I didn't do so because it would not have photographed well. I am also maybe slightly embarrassed at the it all being too hokey. But here is the scene I wanted:The \"diorama\" (for lack of a better term)  was kind of a 'cowboys and alien robots' scene, perhaps catching a branding or a culling in action. Working class types working around dangerous mechanical animals, and suited up in such a way as to get the job done. In some ways, it's no different from ordinary people putting on suits and ties and entering into the constructed fantasy or alien world of business.Anyone recall the 'bacteria\" things I made a few years ago? I guess they are dog analogues now. Helping out the tentacle wranglers. And that lazy bee/cow now has a bee/calf, or a drone, which I guess they helping keep separate. Which suggests I head into the territory of co-evolved partner species, since, really, for the past 50-100,000 years we aren't just people, but people and dogs. Biology is just amazing fodder for art!So, looks like I am heading for a merger of the \"Masque\" and \"mechanicule\" series as well as maintaining both series separately, and I like that that idea of parallel evolution taking as many divergent paths as possible.I am working on more figures to be cast in with my class's stuff in April. I already know those figures will be partnered with the dog/bacteria, and they will have some type of robot livestock to manage.Maybe something more along the lines of sheep robots.In any case, I have also progressed with ideas about the mechnicules in that they need socket \"fasteners\" so that they more readily may be leggoed to one another. I even considered making a pair that have plug heads and anal sockets for joining together. For now they just have limb connections like this guy, who I think will be cast in glass."},
{"title": "That dystopian nightmare known as \"The Jetsons\"", "date": "Thursday, February 6, 2014", "text": "I was thinking about the Jetsons the other day, and I decided it was really not a utopian vision that Hanna-Barbera presented it as.The original series, from 1962-63, was set one hundred years later, in 2062, in a place called Orbit City. George Jetson worked one hour a day at a two day a week job, and complained about it. His wife Judy, was a homemaker, but had a robot maid, Rosie, that actually kept up the place, and had many labor saving devices. George and his family lived in an apartment complex on top of a big metal cylinder. the complex, and all other buildings were representative of the Googie style of architecture.George Jetson's main nemesis was a big-headed robot named Uniblab, who was his supervisor. George also had bombastic little asshole boss named Mr. Spacely, who fires him a lot, and then rehires him before the end of the episode.George also had an ally, R.U.D.I., a computer who it was George's responsibility to turn on and off each work day. R.U.D.I. was a member of the Society to Prevent Cruelty to Humans, which I think is an important clue.I understand these episodes are 1950s sitcoms repackaged in a futuristic vehicle, and as such, satirical of  the progressive consumerist visions of the economy of that time.Still, one could speculate that all this was really just a dark, depressing, fallout-ridden, computer controlled dystopian vision of what it will be like in 2062.Consider:Robots and computer overlords are running things. Henry Orbit, the apartment janitor is the only who can repair or invent things, and he is relegated to the lowest rung of the social ladder. On the other hand, Mr. Spacely and his rival Mr. Cogswell, who are obviously idiots, are in charge. Clearly, some type of mental dissipation among the populace has occurred, possibly due to massive amounts of fallout, and subsequent degradation. I'm not the first to think along these lines. Over at TV tropes, it is pointed out that the reason everyone lives in the sky is that surface world is ravaged and populated with mutants.The machines, although depicted as benevolent consumer devices, do have a tendency to display mischievous qualities, a la the dog-walking treadmill that goes haywire, so that George is forced to shout \"JANE, STOP THIS CRAZY THING!\"Everyone is white.They still use paper money.Dogs that talk.Dogs are smarter than humans.There is a glimmer of hope.

{"title": "Black and White is the New Grey", "date": "Tuesday, February 4, 2014", "text": "First off, since the beginning of the year, the cafeteria food services at the college was privatized. It was turned to a company called Sodexho, which, if you recall two years ago, was the company at the heart of the horse meat scandal in Great Britain. Sodexho also is in the incarceration business over there in France. There was a protest, or actually a petition, which I signed, to object to the closing of the in-house food services. The food was perfectly fine, and, in fact, some dishes, served on china, would have been indistinguishable from meals at finer restaurants in downtown Chicago. One recipe, a fish dish fusion of blackened cajun and ala Mexicana, was so damned good that you had to get there early at lunch to get some before they sold out. But the administration had made up their mind, the cafeteria was a money losing proposition, not part of the college's core business functions, and privatization was what was going to happen. There was some worry that, when Sodexho took over, they would fire the existing staff. But they were kept on, although they no longer prepared the meals according to the in-house recipes. They cook what comes from the supply chain.As one staffer told me \"We just feel lucky to keep our jobs\". I'm sorry, but that is... that's just completely fucked. An economy where you have to suck it up and take it up the ass and feel lucky about it is not an economy that works for us.So, anyway, as a consumer, what I've noticed from the transition is this: smaller portions, lesser quality, higher prices. That's privatization for you.Goddamnit.Other things. I bought myself a present. I bought a Korg Kaossilator 2, which is a dynamic phrase synthesizer about the size of a mobile. I let my nephew mess with it the day after I bought it, and practically had to steal it back from him. It is, I am finding out, an instrument with an immediate playability, but a very steep learning curve to master it. It is a powerful little fucker. I have literally played myself to sleep with the thing.So, I recorded some of the stuff I did on late night drunken jam sessions, and, listening back, discovered all of my kaossilator compositions to be wretchedly horrid. They are, all of them, a messy assault upon the ear drums.As whoever it was said it, it's not the notes you play, it's ones you don't play that count.So, I decided to see what other people were doing with it, and just through random chance, came across a piece by Magical Power Mako, which you can listen to here: https://soundcloud.com/korg/magical-power-mako-kaossilator-2Magical Power Mako? I'd completely forgotten about him, and so went asearchin', and found this:and a short:Ah, yes, from my psychedelic daze days, now long gone.Anyway, In a previous essay, I mentioned how grey was just little fractal pieces of black and white, meaning good and evil. I was looking for an appropriate visual metaphor to add to the essay, found a nice little video on the Mandelbrot set, but decided not to use it. Here it is:You know, back in the late '80s, I had an old IBM PC that I  programmed to generate Mandelbrot and Julia sets on, and then I would print them off in black and white. Many people enjoyed them and they could be found on the walls of cubicles throughout the corporation I worked for.The thing about the picture generation is what you see is not the set itself, but rather the approximation of the set.(Briefly, it goes like this: an iteration of the function z = z2 + C, ( where z is a complex number, like a + ib, or  the variables x + iy, and C is a constant), and the value of z is substituted back into the z squared plus a constant part, and so on, until you get tired of doing it. So what happens is, in lot of cases z goes to infinity. And sometimes it goes to infinity quickly, and sometimes it doesn't, and so the Mandelbrot set is the visualization of how fast or slow this iteration goes. You might have see colored versions like this:In the case of black and white visualization, some arbitrary small number eta is picked that determines the cut between how fast or slow it all goes, Clear?)So, anyway, I played around with fractal generation for awhile, but only for a while because it got boring. Seen one, seen 'em all. And not real life with it's constant change and variety. Now some say, \"How can you call this kind of math boring? It goes to infinity. Does that not just make you swoon?\"And I say, no. See, the problem I have with maths and mathematical platonists is the same problem I have with so many other things, which is, it doesn't change. You can wait an eternity and come back and examine a mathematical function theorem or number or graph, and it never changes.And some say, well, see? It's eternal, not transient, and so superior to this crude matter and ephemeral reality we see around us. And to that I say, no, what unchangingness means is it is at all not alive, but dead as hell, and therefore ultimately incapable of growth or novelty or, anything fun, and therefore, over the long run, boring. And since all it has going for it is over the long run, that's a sad state of affairs.Because once you've been exposed to it, gotten over the delight and surprise, it will always be the same, never new or different, like TV reruns in Hell.So, the question is, how does this dead zombie math get confused with real life? Because it approximates life. But it is not life, Jim, not life as we would know it, or want it.   Oh, and, by the way...the giraffe ate his head"},

Amazing.The rich are stupid. Or, at least, capable of stupid things. The problem is, like automating a mistake, their wealth compounds the stupidity into something of grotesquely monumental proportions.So, maybe they aren't stupid. Or maybe, we should stop equating success with smarts. Or rather, perhaps this is a case of not being the fastest runner, but merely being a faster runner than your neighbor when being chased by a rhino. Or a giant running cave bear. Or a giant running cave bear with chainsaws for teeth.Chuang Tse mentioned (and his quote is the title of this essay) that skepticism is required when evaluating our way of life. If we are in a fortunate circumstance, we are tempted to regard our way of life as better than the ways of others, and thus, perhaps that we are somehow better.We cannot deny inequality of ability, but still, are we truly superior?We might be superior. We might even be right about it. But we must recognize that we might accidentally be right. Or at least recognize that a superior way of life may be superior on functionally similar grounds. But you know, the minute the ground shifts under your feet and that functionality is no longer as efficacious as it was... See, that's the fallacy of survival of the fittest, fit for current conditions. And if you are dumb enough to think that the fitness landscape is an unchanging fitness landscape instead of a seascape, well...In any case, once evidence is out there that your semi-divine heroes are not so super, once that master of the universe is not so adroit or magisterial, once that doubt is planted, once that avenue of inquiry is open, one has to ask, who else is stupid?Are smart people stupid? I think so. I know so. I've certainly met more than my fair share of compartmentally stupid people. And public intellectuals and pundits certainly have more than their fair share of clueless douchebags.What about... the Founding Fathers?They said to themselves, we are the elite, we are the educated, we are the rich, we are the leisured class. Since we are rich, we are not corruptible.Since we are educated, we are wise.Since we are elite, we are incapable of error.And since we are leisurely, we have plenty enough time to devote to good governance.Oh, wow. Really?looking back, they worried about the wrong thing, didn't they? Products of the Enlightenment, favored to be educated in classics, they looked to Rome. Big fucking mistake.By fixating on Rome, they wasted a lot of time worrying about the threat of the standing army, the police and military. But soldiers and police are not the problem, are they? They can be made to be the problem through dumb policy decisions. So let's blame politicians. But politicians are not the problem either, are they? Why are you getting mad at the chess pieces?So, it's the power players that are the problem? But let's be egalitarian, and suggest that, though a lot of them meant well (and ooh, the lessons of history suggest there's a big problem) and thus, like the idiot with the hammer that sees all the world as a nail, there are many introspective enough to recognize they are there by differing parts cleverness, effort, position, and a huge portion of luck, and so, perhaps there are other alternatives to their way or the highway.But then there are plenty who are parasitic assholes. Alright, so maybe only some of them are parasitic assholes. So, are parasitic assholes the problem? It is the evolutionary asshole niche that is populated by the stupid that is the problem.Isn't it?...maybe I'm being stupid about this.*No, he never said that, but stupid people love short, false attributions.

{"title": "Junius and Albert's Adventures in the Confederacy: A Book Report", "date": "Wednesday, January 29, 2014", "text": "First off, before I get started, a new approach towards Tesla's dream is out there, and I hope it all works out. Okay, that said...\"Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité\" is, for me, a valid and logical sentiment. Much of the contest of wills - as I see it -  in the US of A comes down to liberals stressing the equality part of the motto, whilst conservatives favor the liberty part. Both fail to give enough attention or support to the fraternity part. Junius and Albert's Adventures in the Confederacy: A Civil War Odyssey by Perter Carlson is a likeable and readable book - so likeable and readable that I got his previous K Blows Top from the library.  (It's in the pipe, as I am in the process of reading the lovely Karen Lord's Best of All Possible Worlds and then Redemption in Indigo, and I still have to get to Black Empire...). Junius Browne and Albert Richardson are war correspondents for the New York Tribune. Captured at Vicksburg, paroled for return to the Union, they are instead imprisoned for twenty months (no doubt for being Yankee scribblers employed by Horace Greeley's hated abolitionist newspaper, a near lynching offense). They are shuttled in jails, first incarcerated at the relatively benign Libby Prison in Richmond, then the notorious Castle Rock prison, and then finally the death camp of Salisbury Prison in North Carolina. I should be quick to point out that neither side in the war had a monopoly on cruelty and brutality. The Confederates had Andersonville, Belle Isle, and Salisbury, to name a few, the Union had Ft. Delaware, Rock Island, and Elmira. All took in relatively healthy men, and spat out wretched, starving, skeletonized, vermin-ridden creatures who barely resembled men. We tend to forget that the horrors of war are not a modern creation.Serving as hospital attendants, and living in relative comfort thanks to a corrupt warden, Browne and Richardson eventually escape by simply walking out the gate of Salisbury Prison. They spend a hard two month journey through winter Appalachia, making it to the Union camp in eastern Tennessee, helped by an assortment of interesting characters.It's a well-told tale, with larger than life characters, but there is the one flaw, in that one tends to forget how fundamentally sad it all is. Perhaps it's not a flaw, for the sadness is there, but wrapped up in an adventure yarn.There were times that gave me pause. We tend to think of that war as black and white, good versus evil, and then are told a more sophisticated outlook is shades of grey. But grey is composed of little tiny fractal pieces of black and white, and this distinction of sophistication really comes to nothing when confronted with the vilest and most despicable - and most noble and gracious giving - behaviors of the actors in this play.One can't help to take pause when reading something like:Ten minutes later, they came upon another slave cabin. When the old man who lived there heard they were Yankees, he said he'd be happy to feed them. He invited them into the cabin, and introduced them to his wife and daughter. Then he went outside and killed two chickens. He stayed outside, on guard, while the women cooked the birds and the Yankees huddled near the fire, their wet clothes steaming... When the Yankees had devoured the chicken and hot cornbread, Richardson took out the bag of tea he'd smuggled out of prison. The women had never seen tea before, so he showed them how to brew it, and then the slaves and escaped prisoners sat down to an odd little tea party. Revived by the food and the tea, the Yankees thanked their host and hostesses and got up to leave. \"May God bless you\" the old woman said with tears in her eyes. Her husband noticed that Browne had no hat to wear on the long, cold journey, so he pulled off his own and handed it to Junius. The hat was humble - an ancient, shapeless, sweat-soaked woolen sock - but the gesture was grand. Here was a man who owned almost nothing - he did not even own himself - but he was willing to give his hat to a stranger he'd probably never see again\".When I think of Silicon Valley and Wall Street billionaires comparing themselves to Jews persecuted by Nazis, who feel they are not being properly respected, who don't have the first fucking clue what charity is, and I compare them to these grand human beings, I want to bend the rich spoiled brats over my knee and give them such a spanking as they've never had in their lives.I can't help but think that The Confederacy is one the vilest and most evil human excretions ever exuded. I can't hate the people, though. I can hate some of the people, and mainly the rich merchants who wished to maintain the liberty of owning other people as chattel property. Far too many people of the South were either actively opposed, or involuntarily entrained, in that horrid and wholly undemocratic festering enterprise.Appalachians, for example, viewed it as a \"rich man's war, poor man's fight\" (and how often has that sentiment rung down through time?).\"In the South's vast flatlands, society was dominated by rich men who owned large plantations and many slaves, and who considered themselves aristocrats. In the mountains, where the land was unsuited for plantation agriculture, few people owned slaves and most families scratched a living growing corn, raising hogs, and shooting deer. The flatland aristocrats controlled the state governments and mocked the mountaineers as ignorant, uncultured hillbillies. Proud and a bit prickly, the mountaineers detested the aristocrats as haughty, greedy, and arrogant. William G. \"Parson\" Brownlow, the acid-tongued Methodist preacher who edited the Knoxville Whig, summed up the mountaineers' attitude: 'We have always despised, in our heart of hearts, a hateful aristocracy in this country, based on the ownership of a few ashy Negroes, and arrogating to themselves all the decency, all the talents, and all the respectability of the social circle'. The flatland aristocrats reacted to Abraham Lincoln's election by demanding their states secede from the Union, but most mountaineers didn't see Lincoln as threat to their way of life. In the wave of secession conventions in 1861, most delegates from mountain counties in Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee voted against secession\".It is the worst form of historical irony how those who opposed the Confederacy have, over time been rewarded. Some of the poorest and endemically poverty-stricken areas are those mountain counties,  and let's not forget the plight of the enslaved and their descendents. Multiply this by the comfortable and prosperous lives so many of Secessia enjoyed after the war, and still do to this day. It is a stain this nation will never blot out.The war never did end, did it? The North may of won the war, but the South won the peace. We are still struggling with the inequities and injustices, and the sentiment I voiced before still awaits fulfillment, \"\"Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité\". Did I say fraternity? Hardly, it really should be \"sororité\". The inescapable fact throughout the book, and history, is that, it may be men who are the breadwinners and fighters most of the time, but always, always, it is the women who are bone and sinew of our society. There is the beautiful Melvina Stephens, who guides escaped prisoners past Rebel encampments. A chapter is devoted to her, but really, not enough mention is made to the heroines in this book. But they are there, holding society together. I pay these redoubtable and truly courageous creatures too short a shrift. They deserve more. The escaped prisoners come to a cabin inhabited by Mrs. Welborn and her daughters. Keep in mind they are little better than tramps, their clothes in tatters, filthy and lice-ridden:\"It was a large cabin, divided into three rooms, with white curtains on the windows and pictures cut from newspapers decorating the walls. The girls gave up their beds so the visitors could sleep in comfort. In the morning, Mrs. Welborn made a breakfast while her two youngest daughters, aged four and six, stood guard outside, watching for anybody coming up the road that passed by the cabin. When a local woman of dubious loyalties wandered up the road, Mrs. Welborn and one of her daughters casually stood in the doorway, blocking the view into the cabin while the Yankees scrambled to hide. After breakfast, the girls reported a squad of Confederate cavalry was riding up the road. Mrs. Welborn motioned to her visitors to hide under the beds. Then she walked out to the porch and casually bantered with the horsemen for several minutes, feigning nonchalance, until they rode off. 'All is safe, boys' she announced.\"  In all, as I said, it's a fundamentally sad book posing as an adventure tale, and a buddy story, but you'll get the idea if you read it."},

(Chasing is the term used for taking small tool steel tools that have all sorts of different surfaces and shapes on the end, and using them to hammer down or chisel off blisters, zits, scabs, pieces of foil, or any other thing minute thing on the surface of the bronze that shouldn't be there.Then, I used an oxidizer to patina the bronze to a darker hue. Then I used steel wool to burnish back a lot of the dark oxidized surface. Then I waxed it all down and polished it with a cloth.And then I took preliminary photos with an improvised backdrop. Real photos to take place next week.Here are the \"dailies\", one under florescent lighting and one under incandescent:At the beginning of the year, I made a half-serious resolution that I would try to entertain myself with my own content. Clearly, that's not entirely possible. I do go to movies. I do go to the library. I do watch some TV. I listen to other people's music.And it's important to do that. I once had a former English teacher of mine, a good friend of my mom's, berate me for not reading any fiction. I asked why I should, and she told me that it is important to entertain perspectives and worldviews other than one's own. That's.... that was a good answer.Reading, like travel, broadens one's own experiences and is a good innoculation against bigotry and small-mindedness.So, I will continue to read and absorb and experience other people's stuff, but I feel I need to start really fleshing out my own internal worlds with narratives and stories and rationalizations and justifications, at least so that there is a coherence to the kind of art I am making. Just so that I've got, for lack of a better term, a ground floor of sanity for all this weirdness.Doesn't mean I'm going to give you the stories behind these things. That's YOUR job!"},

Not a problem. I changed the structure some. Originally, the pulling guy was to the side, and that looked crowded and energy stifled. So, I moved pulling guy out to be opposite pushing guy, and I think the flow of the narrative is better. They actually look like they are manhandling this stubborn robot beast.From a practical standpoint, pulling guy would have been welded to the lazy bee/cow body with just a thin tentacle of metal holding together the heavy (20lb) pulling guy, and the the heavy (10 lb) body. That rod of bronze would have bent or broken. So, I decided not to weld the tentacle cap to the rest of the body.There is a slight gap, but I seem to be the only one that notices. In any case, I'm glad and sad it's done, or will be done. I guess I better make more."},

(No pictures of that, sorry, but you seen one molten metal pour, you pretty much get the idea. Unless there is a steam explosion). I hammered off the shell and found only a heat-tear on the tentacles, which is when the metal cools and shrinks, but the ceramic shell investment does not, and shears the metal. I chased and cleaned the figures of surface defects and blisters and zits and oxide shit. Sandblasted all the parts and called it quits about 11pm.What's today? Right, Wednesday. Did I mention all this grinding and such outside in the patio area? Classes were in session. Temp was about 15-16F most of the day. About 3pm classes got done and I moved into the wood shop.I took over a table in the wood shopThat was nice, coming in from the cold, but I got to tell you, that arctic air sure is sweet smelling and fresh. Anyway, I repaired the heat-tears on the tentacles by welding them and  grinding down the welds.

I will use the air die grinders to clean up all the spatter and make the surfaces seamless.Cowl welded to body and welds ground downI have to weld pulling guy and the tentacle onto the tentacle part of Lazy Bee/Cow. Naturally, they did not fit, so I hammered and bent parts on everything until they did fit together.Lazy Bee/Cow in parts.Pulling guy needs a few more adjustments, and then I will weld those together.Pulling guy ready to have hat welded on.I still have a headache.

Some furnace cement and will let them cure over the weekend and cast them next week. Cast the figures today. Between the two of them, they used 40 pounds of metal. I did not have sufficient metal left in the crucible for the other two molds. I decided not to get greedy and do another heat. Will cast those two with the repaired shells next week.Here are the figures.Pushing GuyPulling GuyPushing Guy mostly decantedPulling Guy partially decantedTentacles on both came out greatTwo hours on after the pour, and the metal figures are still uncomfortably hot to the touch.I still, after ten years, have a lot to learn about rigging.I'm getting casting defects that would not be there had I rigged the pieces properly. Both pieces suffer from shrink porosities, where the cooling metal collapses as there is no replacement feed from the rigging. Shrink bobs - large masses on the runner near the gate to the piece - would have ameliorated this defect somewhat. As it is, both of their asses looked like they got chewed up badly.Either shrink bobs, or I need to add more runners. I hesitate to do this as it means more work removing them and cleaning up the surface where they were attached. But the amount of welding and grinding I will do to fix the defects turns out to be the same amount of work of removing the extra runners. I just have to get used to sacrificing the piece to make the sculpture, like killing the book to make the movie.The other problem is I rushed dipping the pieces before the slurry was completely mixed. As a result, there were millimeter-sized bubbles like little zits that are now on the surface. I've dealt with this before. They are easy to remove, but waiting an extra six hours would have eliminated this problem, and I still would have been able to cast them today.I really should keep notes on all this."},

I was told I needed to use every social media tool at my command. What I found out was social media tools only work if you are already famous.I have shaved back on my twitter output after reading some of my tweets and realizing I come across as a drunken asshole. That might be because whenever I posted a text message, I was drunk.I'm also starting to realize that most people on twitter aren't all that shiny to begin with. I had an opportunity to engage in a (I kid you not) \"twitter fight club\" event. Twitter fight club is an oxymoron. It sounds like annoying little birdies pooping and cheeping in mid-air, little pin feathers flying about - something that pretty much begs for a shotgun intervention.Honestly, how can you have any kind of a worthwhile discussion in an SMS format, when the internet can barely provide one through the more expressive bulletin board system?In any case, after checking out the profiles of the participants, I realized they were all unpleasant, miserable assholes. Which is to say, the very flower of public intellectualism and academia. So, no, pass, and, in words the twits may be more likely to comprehend: \"Fuck off\".I am just going to use twitter for pictures and announcements, which is the intended use, right?Actually, I think George Clooney is correct that famous people that use twitter are morons.  They should let their publicists do twitter for them.Plus, the twitter app was making my already unstable HTC POS phone even more unstable. I've had to factory reset it twice. If it weren't free, I'd be annoyed.Come to think of it, I probably come across as a drunken asshole on blogger as well. Thing is, on blogger I've always been sober, so I'm not quite sure how to deal with that realization.Thing is, in the philosophical contest between epigenesis and preformationism, I've come down firmly in the epigenesis camp. Meaning, in practice, or at least as an informal unwritten rule, I will never do anything more than a first draft in my essays. In other words, any order that unfolds will have to unfold in the unfolding. That was kind of the unspoken ground rule in choosing a random walk theme. If it happens, it's gravy.Epigenesis has distinct disadvantages. Without a solid plan, things can go pear-shaped quite rapidly. Drains can be circled. Thorny paths plunged down. Take my fiction writing. It suffers from being (partially revised) first draft stuff. And, since I am basically quite lazy, very few risks are taken in the narrative, because messy situations require thought to contrive and resolve. Rereading the stuff, it's all quite boring.Still, working from just the kernel of a plan is exciting. If only I put more effort into it. Speaking of which, things are going swimmingly with the bronze figures. I've managed, at breaks in the studio schedule, to sneak in and invest the wax pieces in ceramic shell.Seventh Dip and Stucco InvestmentSeventh Dip and Stucco InvestmentAt this rate, I'l burn them out tonight, which is ahead of schedule.

Way to preserve shit, Mexico!Also I found out the stuff I wanted to submit for a show has a submission due date of February 1st. I need to take pictures of the finished bronzes, so I am compressing the process of wax-to-finished-bronze down to two weeks. I considered the fact that that actually doesn't put me under that much pressure, and so thought of procrastinating a week, but, no. Better to anticipate problems (which there will be because there always is), and so I have rigged up the pieces and am in the process of investing them:First dip and stucco applicationFirst dip and stucco applicationFirst dip and stucco applicationI'll probably be done investing them by Friday, and then burn them out on MLK day, and cast the bronzes as early as possible next week.

It is electro-psychedelia stuff that allows me to get in the flow and work like a machine right through all the tedious stuff. I need to find more music like this.I wonder if I'm displaying some kind of maturity in not procrastinating. But you know, I used to think I was a terrible procrastinator until I saw, well, pretty much everyone else. I don't think it is maturity. I think it is discipline. That's what you get being raised by a Navy man. Thanks, Dad.Other things. I'm starting to think now (referring to the title of this essay), is that Obama's problem may be that he is from the Future. Well, no, he is from Hawaii. But if you think about it, Hawaii is kind of the future, maybe the whole Star Trek war-socialist future. Think about it .The most geographically isolated spot on planet Earth has everyone there. (And by everyone, I mean every kind of person on Earth is there).Pick the spot that is furthest away, the antipodes of Hawaii, which is the Kalahari desert in northern Botswana. Go to Hawaii, and you can find a Bushman someplace. Not only that, but that Bushman is probably married to a Sami. Hawaii has the highest percentage of mixed race children and couples of all states in the United States.Hawaii also has a very generous federal budget, what with eleven military bases there. For most everyone there, Hawaii is a very pleasant place to live. The whole laid-back lifestyle is exemplified there. (Which makes me wonder, where do people from Hawaii go on vacation). For comparison purposes, how about Hawaii versus Florida? You know, Florida, where they just don't like black people, no sir ree.So, given this relative paradise to be raised up in, is it any wonder Obama has problems dealing with all of us miserable shits out here in the primitive and paranoid world of the early 21st century? I'm thinking, yes, which explains so, so much.Back to work!"},
{"title": "Breach of Trust: A Book Report", "date": "Friday, January 10, 2014", "text": "Breach of Trust: How Americans Failed Their Soldiers and Their Country by Andrew J. BacevichShort review: Read it. It is worth reading.Longer review: Bacevich is very good at systems analysis, but his synthesis and suggestions are a little shaky. He himself recognizes that.I've read Bacevich's Limits of Power, and I think he is right on in predicting (if things stay the same) America's eventual collapse through perpetual war, the enrichment of out-of-touch elites (as well as private contractors, and members of the military-industrial-congressional complex, and I leave it to the reader to work out the Venn diagram), and the approaching privatized serfdom of anyone who isn't an elite (I believe the term is \"niggerization\").He makes a similar argument in this book comparing the American Imperium's current taste for war to Imperial (and its extension, National Socialist) Germany, which couldn't see an answer that didn't involve shooting at the problem.He goes further to suggest that U.S. foreign policy has undergone Israelification: anticipatory defense, preemptive war, and a display of a take-no-guff pugnacity. Considering Israel is a small country surrounded by hostile neighbors, and America is an immense country with no enemy even remotely close to it, one wonders how we arrive at this policy. But here we are, and, combined with the Pentagon's desire for full spectrum dominance, results in America looking like the biggest, most oppressive goon on the planet.He places America's chickenshit behavior squarely at the feet of an indifferent American public, as well he should.  But the method, the displacement of the citizen-soldier for a volunteer professional army (as result of which, he contends, America, once a nation reluctant to enter into foreign wars without some personal stake on the part of the citizenry now freely engages in adventurism), I need to work that over a bit before I agree, if I do.A corollary to this thesis is that all the failed wars America has waged (and in Bacevich's view, all wars after 1945 are failed wars) are the result of this public indifference, and I would agree with this. Consider the public reaction to the first Gulf War, which supposedly broke the back of Vietnam Syndrome, piling on to the mood of  unthinking triumphalism, followed by disaffection with a mild recession, ultimately resolved with still more consumer distractions, with most of the public ignoring the actual situation:\"Yet facts evident at the time ought to have warned Pentagon leaders against nursing utopian expectations. Those facts included not only the Somalia debacle (the true preview of things to come) but also the survival of Saddam Hussein's regime in Baghdad; the failed uprising by Iraqi Shiites and Kurds after Desert Storm that saddled Washington with unforeseen enforcement and protection responsibilities; the emergence will-nilly of a \"dual containment\" policy directed against both Iraq and Iran; and the establishment of a large scale military presence in the Islamic world, inducing lethal blowback in the form of terrorist attacks directed against U.S. forces  and American interests. The actual legacy of Desert Storm was to plunge the United States more deeply into a sea of difficulties for which military power provided no antidote.\"However, though the fault of America's unfortunate foreign escapades must surely be place at the feet of John Q. Public, I am not convinced that the systemic problem is entirely through abandonment of the  the so-called citizen-soldier militia. In fact, save for occasional dissent (and even that usually after the fact and sometimes with the outcome going badly) Americans have displayed a remarkable bloodthirstiness, bellicosity, and full-throated approval of kicking the shit out of (almost invariably) lesser opponents.The Mexican War, the hundreds of Indian wars, the Spanish-American War all serve as examples where a citizen-soldiery stood ready to exercise a vigorous belligerence, with nary a thought as to the consequences.Bacevitch suggest some form of return to the draft, perhaps a national service requirement with only some (presumably vetted) portion of young people seeing military service. Public apathy being what it is, Bacevitch doesn't hold out much hope for it. I would agree, and I would suggest there is no systemic solution to his complaints.Uncorrelated Dog Ears from the book:Franklin Delano Roosevelt surely must stand as the second greatest (behind Lincoln, possibly) president we have had. It was he who brilliantly took a jug-eared, slack-jawed rube of a nation, and turned it into a jug-eared, slack-jawed, world-striding titan. This really is worth an essay all on its own.\"...although achieving victory would require shared sacrifice, the president would seek to limit the pain and suffering that Americans would actually endure. The price of defeating the Axis promised to be high. Yet FDR intended, wherever possible, to offload that price onto others, the while claiming for the United States the lion's share of any benefits... the outcome of World War II turned, above all, on two factors: in Europe, the prowess and durability of the Red Army; in the Pacific, the weakness and vulnerability of the Japanese economy\".On the ineffectual and blinkered views of both the left and the right: \"Yet a people who permit war to be waged in their name while offloading onto a tiny minority responsibility for it's actual conduct have no cause to complain about an equally small minority milking the system for all it's worth. Crudely put, if the very rich are engaged in ruthlessly exploiting the 99 percent who are not, their actions are analogous to that of American society as a whole in its treatment of soldiers: the 99 percent who do not serve in uniform just as ruthlessly exploit the 1 percent who do.\"Where it stands now, and has since at least 1917. Again, the centenary of that conflict deserves any number of essays:\"Having forfeited responsibility for war's design and conduct, the American people may find that Washington considers that grant of authority irrevocable. The state now owns war, with the country consigned to observer status.\" \"...efforts by intellectuals (or quasi intellectuals) eager to do the bidding of power more than offset the efforts of those intent on holding power accountable... (the essayist Randolph) Bourne bitterly opposed U.S. involvement in World War I. A great majority of American intellectuals had shared that position - until President Woodrow Wilson declared it incumbent upon the United States to join hands with Great Britain, France, and Russia in making the \"world safe for democracy\". With that, the intellectual stampede in favor of war commenced. Wilson depicted the war as a contest pitting civilization against barbarism. Not buying this line, Bourne took out after intellectuals who did. \"Only in world where irony is dead\" he wrote, \"could an intellectual class enter war at the head of such illiberal cohorts in the avowed cause of world-liberalism and world-democracy\"... to believe otherwise was to allow a faux patriotism to eclipse independent judgement. Yet once Congress declared war, a demand for slavish compliance swept through editorial offices and faculty lounges like a hurricane. \"In a time of faith\" Bourne wryly observed, \"skepticism is the most intolerable of insults\".\""},

Between the twenty-five inches of snow and the -16F weekend freeze, the whole region was shut down. Not that that mattered to me, as the college was closed yesterday and today because of the polar vortex.Sunday night, I had to find out for myself just how cold it was, so, maybe a little liquored up, I stepped outside barefoot wearing t-shirt and jeans. Wind about 20 gusting to 40, temp at -15 = wind chills of -45F with occasional -50F. It was fan-fucking-tastic! REALLY amazing. Like a reverse sauna!It also - as it was Birdseye frozen food conditions - got damned cold very quickly. In retrospect, not the smartest move I made. I was on the phone to eldest brother in California at the time, giving him an up-to-date report on the outdoors. He suggested I get a double handful of snow and apply it to either side of my scrotum (meaning, he thought I was a knucklehead). But honestly, I was out maybe two minutes max, and frostbite don't kick in until after about ten minutes.And then I did it again last night. I managed about two minutes before I came back in. But same experience, really kind of a wonderful exhilaration, with the promise of a warm retreat in the offing. Ah, but to be out there, improperly dressed, again, for a supposedly bright person, pretty much a bonehead move.But, you know, I've always like experiencing extreme weather events. I can remember much colder winters than this one. I did a quick check, and Chicago had -23F, 29 mph winds = -83F windchill temps on Xmas Eve, 1983. I was out in that too.So, I guess I'm turning into a fat old cat that likes his cozy warm spot. Can't handle it anymore, I guess.But you know, we have all become quite the comfort-loving creatures over the past 10,000 years or so, no? I mean, my ice-ape ancestors were out and about through 100,000 years of ice. Hell, we humans are winter killers. In fact, most North hemisphere predators are winter killers.

{"title": "That Titanium Nail", "date": "Friday, January 3, 2014", "text": "It's not right for an alien monster to have such sexy eyes. That's what creepy about the Kraken, their beautiful eyes. Eyes that are invariably beautiful, soulful, with a clear white sclera, fantastically colored irises, the most gorgeous human eyes I've ever seen. Now, I'd seen the Kraken on television, going back to 1978 when one of their city-plus-sized, lit-up-like-Vegas-neon starships first appeared in orbit above our heads. But meeting them in person, that's a whole different thing, considering they are real alien monsters, and not the cartoon everyone is used to seeing.Clark The Kraken was an '80's children's cartoon involving two children named Becky and Josh and their alien monster friend Clark the Kraken. The premise of the show was that Clark would get the children involved in off-world adventures that invariably put them in danger. Clark (who was responsible for putting them in harm's way) would find some clever way of saving them. Clark was depicted as manic and maniacal. He could perform miracles, but rarely did. Clark was really just out for fun, fun, fun. In other words, he was completely insane. There were some diplomatic worries about the character, but the Kraken loved the show. They paid for it's revival in syndication when it was cancelled. Except for having eight tentacular limbs, Clark the Kraken really didn't look anything like a real kraken. At first glance, you'd think a kraken was a fur coat - a really big fur coat, like what maybe a big barbarian Viking would wear. The fur is typically a rich golden brown, and you are tempted to stroke the fur. But you realize no one is wearing the coat. The coat is standing on its own, and has six extra arms, which aren't arms, but tentacles. Peaking out from the underside of the tentacles are rows of black talons. The incongruity of this soft, fuzzy, furry creature with tentacles and nightmare features, a slavering vagina dentata of a mouth filled with rows of sharp, black fangs makes your brain say, yup, this is an alien monsterMy first very up close and personal meeting involved about thirty of the monster bastards constraining my limbs as they pierced my skull with a titanium nail.  Did I not tell you about the titanium nail embedded in my brain? Ah, well, let me start back on Earth.There I was, 1980, fresh out of college, with a BFA and no job prospects. Not that there weren’t jobs aplenty to be had. Humanity was in the midst of the great migrations to the far-flung stars. Detroit - nuclear rocket city - was booming. They couldn't build housing fast enough. The wormhole transport centers: Houston, San Diego, Las Vegas, Newark, Knoxville, were begging for workers - skilled and unskilled. Plenty of jobs for all, unless you were a painter that favored a garish fantasy genre, or a poet, or a musician. I was the slacker prototype, or stereotype, literally living in my parent’s basement, smoking a lot of pot and dabbling with alcoholism.At the insistent urging of my father, who wanted his basement back, I took the emigrant aptitude tests for a colony berth, and an evaluation for NATO’s peranoscopy program as well. Rejected on the former, accepted for the latter, to everyone’s respective expectation and surprise. The emigrant tests were based upon NATO selection criteria, where you basically had to be able to rebuild Western civilization with your bare hands. It was assumed that the peranoscopy tests were for those that made the emigrant cut, the best of the best, but were actually Kraken-developed tests, measuring... what? No one knew. So, shipped off to Lemont, IL to live for six months in a shit-box apartment with a truly awful roommate. Some called the training \"hippie boot-camp\", if sitting in cubicles in a strip mall office, practicing lucid dreaming and meditation skills, writing out counterfactual stories, reading texts on everything, doing crosswords, word problems, Scrabble on hallucinogens, having your brain remotely manipulated via transcranial magnetic stimulation, being harassed by lab-coated pricks for reasons not entirely clear, is your idea of hippie boot camp.I came out the other end a trainee peranoscopist. Which is basically someone who can pierce the veils of space and time to scry the reality on the other side. Want another term? How about oracle, or seer, auger, sage? Or soothsayer, provided, the soothsayer wears an electromagnetic cap seated over their visual cortex, being fed data from the averaged-out Planck areas from the Gödel boundary of an Everett wormhole aperture.Then I was stationed at Nellis, outside of Vegas, a civilian in name and title and in nothing else. I spent  twelve hour shifts in an air-conditioned trailer, ‘scoping the heavens for candidate worlds and smelling other people's farts. The depressing majority of earthlike worlds (or superearths, as they are known) are too massive to be habitable. Of the less massive worlds, most are venus worlds, hellish and waterless. The remainder are waterworlds, with hundred kilometer-deep oceans covering them. It seems that, despite the common abundance of superearths, very few have just the right amount of water, mass, and distance from their star. Of those, only a tiny percentage have evolved life, and a tiny percentage of those have evolved life compatible with ours - life that won’t eat your skin off after a few minutes of exposure, or cause a hyper-allergic reaction, or induce permanent psychotic states, or any of a thousand other grisly ways to die. It turns out, within the particle horizon of the local universe, some 96 billion light years in diameter, or some 13.7 billion years back into the past, there are only nineteen worlds suitable for human colonization.Only nineteen.We did not know that. The Kraken eventually informed us of this. I do not know why they waited until some twenty million of us were forever lost to the universe to tell us, but... before the Kraken revealed this fact, I found one of those nineteen worlds, which is why you are reading about me. When I did find that world, I was informed by my unpleasant Navy captain boss that I was invited to have an super-advanced alien device implanted in my brain. A super-advanced alien device that was, in every way, indistinguishable from a three-penny nail made of titanium.Actually, the way unpleasant captain put it was: \"Eight Ball, you got lucky. You get a chance not to be a fucking magic eight ball stuck on this base for another five years. You want to go to the stars, visit other worlds? Go get the nail in your brain\".I accepted. I was immediately whisked down to the Las Vegas transport dome in a helicopter no less, pretty cool. I was taken inside the dome through a warren of neutral-toned office corridors under fluorescent lights. The walls of the corridors were occasionally adorned with pictures and plaques. Many pictures were of the EGERbridge tower site at Argonne National Laboratory - the very first wormhole aperture, now a World Heritage site.  In one picture, Pat Nixon, a beaming Dick Nixon beside her, cuts the ribbon for the power-up ceremony.  In other pictures, astronauts, or the ships used in exploring the other side of a wormhole aperture. Many pictures were of The Five: (Lovell, Mitchell, Roosa, Mattingly, and Haise), standing in front of a scale model of their nuclear-powered ship Columbia. Ship and all hands lost now, disappeared down an Everett/Gödel wormhole throat, never to be seen again. Lost to the Cosmos But Not Forgotten. (It is a historical irony that two of the most miserable miscreants in American history, Richard Nixon and Hugh Everett III, gave humanity the stars. My own peranoscopery studies of the past tell me it was John Archibald Wheeler who was the linchpin. Had Wheeler not gotten Kurt Gödel to read Everett's many worlds paper, none of this would have happened. When the technology caught up to E/G theory in 1968, Nixon cancelled the Vietnam War and the Apollo Moon Program, and the rest is history).I ended up in a fake wood-paneled waiting room with a metal green door. The green metal door opened, and a guy in a white boiler suit said \"You're next\". Beyond the green door was a prep room with a big airlock door opposite. Beyond the airlock, the wormhole dome itself. The airlock door was windowless, a disappointment. There’s not even a view of the wormhole aperture, which, I’m told, looks like a 100 foot round glowing molten metal droplet hovering in mid-air (except it’s vacuum) above and below two giant metal cylinder heads.   In the middle of the prep room was a stainless steel box, lid open, looking like a coffin. \"Get in\", ordered white boiler suit. I din't really think about it, I just got in. But then I thought wait, airtight coffin for the vacuum, no air tank for me. \"Hang on, no air supply?\" I asked.\"You got thirty minutes of air in there, you big baby. If you're not out before then, you got bigger problems than suffocation!\" sneered white boiler suit. \"But I still suffocate!\" The lid was closed and dogged secure on this protest.And then I was on the planet Gnomon, somewhere in the Horologium supercluster. (get it? Horologium? Gnomon?)The Kraken chose Gnomon as an enclave for human contact, surrounded by countless trillions upon trillions of Kraken-inhabited worlds within the Horologium supercluster. We humans, in our arrogance, assumed this world to be the homeworld of the Kraken, only to find out that their planet of origin was swallowed by its sun some half a billion years ago, and some 300 vigintillion light years away from Earth. Gnomon is where you go to get a super-advanced alien artifact that looks like a titanium nail driven into your skull. It was local dawn when I am decanted and let out of the admin building, the sky turned from black tar to a sullen cherry, the color of a cooling branding iron.  Above, at the zenith, was a gigantic Halloween moon - the gas giant Gnomon orbits, a hot jupiter circling a red dwarf star. (The palette of the planet Gnomon is limited. Red light kills color. It turns yellows and oranges into a uniform red hue, and makes green and blue look black. Even red is not immune. Yellow-reds turn into blue-reds; dark reds turn into brown). The admin building was a pre-fab pole-barn structure that houses the wormhole aperture, and looked slightly more permanent than the other buildings in the human town. Hardly a town, and more of a joke, a trailer park really. The majority of the structures were trailers and intermodal containers, limited by the size of the wormhole aperture. Here and there streetlights provided a half-hearted attempt to produce yellow sunlight, but did little to relieve the gloom. Beyond these lonely, humble structures were low black hummocks and hills that clumped to the horizon. I had not much time to \"admire\" the view before an army sergeant in a jeep pulled up to meet me.\"Get in\" he said, which I assumed I would hear until after the insertion procedure, after which it would be \"Get out\".\"What, no ID check? No paperwork to fill out? I just get in the jeep and we go?\"\"Are you Kurman?\" I nodded. \"Get in! And this is not a jeep. This is a MUTT, an M151 Military Utility Tactical Truck. Got it? Not a jeep\".\"And you are?\" I asked as I climbed in.\"Camarena. Sgt. Camarena. We don't have far to go\". We took off with a lurch towards the low hills. After about a half hour on a gravel road, we passed over a gloomy ridge, I thought I spotted a brightly lit area, and it was green. Vivid green.\"Is that where we are going?\" I asked, but just then, over the next rise, appeared a huge square of vivid green, a bright day-lit field as if we were back on Earth. I looked up in the charcoal sky, and there were no lights to account for it. Taken against the color of Gnomon, or rather the lack of it, the field was a riot of florescent green, impossibly green, all verdant green grass and scattered bush. Animals grazed within this hallucinatory field of green. Some animals I did not recognize or know. Giant lumbering shaggy things, droves of deer-and-elk-sized things, shoals of small quick things that browsed upon the grassy fields. Other animals I did know - cows, sheep, goats, possibly a giraffe in the distance. Interspersed among the animals, shaggy octopus forms wheeled about lazily. These were the callows, the Kraken young. Around this magical plot of land was a barb-wired fence, homely and worn wooden posts spaced out to suspend the rusting wire.“You’d think, a billion years ahead of us, they’d have something more than a barb wire fence? I guess you go with what works.\" observed Camarena, and nodded. \"There’s your reception committee.”Behind a section of fence were three adult kraken. One motioned me forward with a disturbingly human finger crook with the end of its tentacle. The barbed-wire drooped down to let me pass, then snapped back into position behind me.\"Greetings! Welcome!\" exclaimed the middle kraken in a shower of spit. It's English pronunciation, naturally, was flawless. \"We will begin in a moment, but first, observe!\"With this cue, a kraken callow climbed upon the back of a nearby cow. It quickly wrapped a tentacle about the cow’s neck, and then, as if pull starting the cow like a lawnmower engine, whipped the tentacle hard and backwards. The cow’s severed head dropped to the ground. An impressive gush of blood issued from the neck. Within seconds, dozens of callows swarmed over the headless standing cow, and it disappeared beneath a mass of squirming fur and writhing tentacles. Soon, only a spot of crimson remained. The callows stood about at attention.“And now your turn!\"“Jesus! Wait!” but the callows were upon me. I struggled and thrashed, kicked and punched, but the horrid little fuckers pinioned my arms, immobilized my legs, wrapped their tentacles around my limbs and torso, and then I felt sharp little talon stings when a tentacle slithered around my neck.\"Don't struggle\", I heard one of the adult kraken say. \"You'll just get cut to pieces if you do\".I froze then, surrendered. All I saw were sharp black talons and fur, and an eye that peered at me. A beautiful eye.  All I heard was the chatter of the kraken in, I supposed, their natural tongue: bronx cheers, shrieks, hisses, screaming gargles. All I smelled was a horrible marine stench, the kind of stink you smell when you dig into the anoxic ooze layer of a tidal flat.I heard a cheerful \"Here we go!\". A seering pain in the top of my head cancelled out the thousand or so pinpricks and razor cuts I felt over the rest of my body, and then...  and then.. and then,and then... I felt vertigo, then nausea. I heard air raid sirens, saw black and white static. The sirens were replaced by a whistling tea kettle on a stove that circled around me. I saw pieces of color in the static, sometimes resolved into little fractal dragonettes or spinning mandelbulbs, and then dissolved, replaced by geometric shapes, lines and lace, mandalas, cartoons, mechanical elves, each image fleet and meshed into the next. My eyes felt as if they had swiveled backwards in their sockets. The nausea returned. Space inverted itself, the nausea and vertigo passed. Cold purple spaces and stars appeared. Jittery little borders surrounded the stars, pieces jinked and flitted around in orbits. The stars swam away in a whirlpool, an armageddon, an apocalypse of fireworks, a receding pyrotechnic snowstorm. I beheld the entire universe, each and every star expanded into a sun, tiny detailed worlds about them. The tea kettle sound became louder, almost unbearable. I'd have stopped up my ears with my fingers had I had hands, but I don't think I did.  Overwhelmed, I managed to shout for it to all stop, but all that came out of my mouth was hissing, spitting, screaming gargle.And then I was laid out upon the grass. Kraken and callows stood and stared at me as if I were making an embarrassing scene, or had had a seizure, which I had been. And ah, of course, I realized, the titanium nail was in my brain.\"We never tire of watching that\", said one of the kraken, ejecting oozing snot from spiricules in appreciation.\"You made it,\" noted Sgt. Camarena, as he held out a hand to help me up. \"Congratulations\".I swayed on my feet a little and then said \"Thank you, Sergeant\".\"Call me Ernie. You ready to go?\"I looked down at myself and saw I my clothes torn and covered in blood. \"Jesus, I'm a mess\", I observed.\"Superficial cuts. We'll clean you up back in town\".  The kraken and callows let out kind of a soft-palate squawk or screech, which I recognized as \"See you later!\",  and I got back into the jeep with Ernie.\"What was that crack about I made it?\" I asked him, as we turned around on the gravel road and back over the rise.\"Oh come on, Eight Ball. You would have chickened out had we told you there was 20% survival rate\", Ernie pulled a clipboard from under his seat. \"Now's the time for paperwork. Uh, and, just so you know, once we are all done here? You can't go back to Earth.\"\"What? Why not?\"\"Look you got a alien device in your head now. We can't be sure of your loyalty to the species. You may now be naturally beholden to the Kraken, and so can never be fully trusted ever again\". He held up his hand in anticipation of my protests, and continued \"yeah, the Kraken have acted all benign and beneficent and given us some kickass technologies and advice, but, for all we know, they may be grooming us for cannon fodder\".\"... or smallpox blankets\" I returned. Sergeant Earnest Camarena turned and stared very hard at me. \"Would you have thought of that before you had a nail in your head?\" he asked.\"...probably not\" I admitted.\"and that's why you can't come back to Earth. But we got a nice place set up for you on Alterra. It's in galaxy NGC6264 out Hercules way, some 450 million light years from Earth\".\"I know where it is\" I said.\"I know you do\" he said, pointed at his head, and nodded slowly."},

It's the oceans, stupid.", "date": "Tuesday, December 31, 2013", "text": "Here's my joke:What's the difference between 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013?I don't know.Exactly!I'm ready for things to change. That may not be what I want. As the Chinese curse points out \"May you live in interesting times\" is not for the better, but it does make for a difference, and I want things to be different. Or at least not to suck so blandly. I may get my wish.Someone asked me what I thought things would be like twenty-five years from now. I mentioned what Charlie Stross said about speculative fiction writing, that short- and long-term stories are easy to do, but mid-long-term stories are the toughest. Easy to trend a few years into the future. Easy to make shit up about the far future. But human-life-span (or twice- or thrice-) type of futures, almost invariably wrong.Example: Using trending in 1888, write about twenty-five years in the future. Now do the same from 1889. Two completely divergent worlds. Linear trending does not predict WWI, which happens in 1914. So... chaos theory may be your only hope. You might be able to predict the entendue of all possible orbits of a clearly feedback dependent, nonlinear societal future, and that's about it.(In my use of the word, I roughly borrow from optics, where entendue is the spread out area of light from a point source at any given time. In my usage, it is any future cross section of all paths of recursive iterations of a nonlinear equation, and thus, the sum-over-histories extent of most possibilities. In other words, just how bad - or good - things can get).So, right now, the movie Soylent Green is looking pretty damn accurate. Worst case we don't have a movie for, as it involves WWIII and the reset button. Maybe even we avoid that, seeing as the ripest point on our history for WWIII was probably August 11, 1984, when Reagan \"outlawed Russia forever\".  Oh sure, those of that remember that \"joke\" think of it as a face-palm moment for American diplomacy, but honestly, it's a good thing some few Soviets had a sense of humor.But anyway, 2038, my bet is we are still around and it ain't as bad as Soylent Green (which is scheduled for 2022, and 23 years after Marty McFly arrives from 1985 Let's review some facts in case you think me suffering from optimism bias.Soylent Green predicted 7 billion people in 2022, with 40 million in NYC alone. Those numbers are a little off. We are at 7 billion now, with 2 billion more expected by mid-21st-century. Right now, 80% are at poverty level. It's true that some billion or so have been lifted out of poverty since the 1980s, but that just means an even bigger human maw to feed.Half of the world's forests have been consumed, most since 1950. 90% of all large wild fish have disappeared from the world's oceans - all from industrial fishing. Dead zones from agricultural run off are spreading at an unprecedented rate. \"Garbage patches\" of floating and sinking plastics are on the uptake in size and numbers. The oceans are rapidly acidifying, and soon will be fit for naught but the most primitive life forms - jellyfish and microbes. It is estimated that humanity now diverts and consumes one quarter of the energy of Earth's biosphere. We are beyond a force of nature.Despite concerns about resource depletion, energy is still plentiful. We will run out of fossil oxygen long before we run out of fossil fuels. Some 70 precent of the oxygen we breath is provided by underwater life. Blue green algae provide 20% of the oxygen in the atmosphere, and other planktonic species, see grasses, mangroves, kelps, and other algae provide oxygen and carbon sequestration.All are in decline.Let's not even talk about the the loss of glaciers and the warming of the higher latitudes. Some people say \"viva la global warming\" (I myself have said it on balmy winter days). But the more likely scenario is called the Big Squeeze, when the desert move north, and the newly defrosted swamps and storms move south, creating a latitudinal squeeze of farmable lands, and an increase in bugs, pests, vermin, and diseases.To use a neologism, humanity seems hellbent on venusiforming planet Earth, turning into a dead world, or at least one that we have to hide from in order to survive.Okay, so have I got a sane idea of what's happening? Think I'm off the mark?Pretty bleak. And yet, I am optimistic. Fully half the coral reefs are in good shape. Ten percent of large predator fish are out there still swimming. Conservation efforts are underway in the most critical core systems, such as Indonesia, South China, and the Philippine Seas to avoid overfishing and restore habitat. (Keep in mind, this in an area of the world that support one fourth of all humans). Large marine parks are proposed throughout the world's oceans. Efforts are underway to reduce agricultural pollution.And I give us twenty-five years to get our shit together. After that, well I won't be around hopefully, and will just send out a ghostly curse to a doomed humanity.But we still got a chance. And maybe it's I got off my ass and help do something instead of bitching about it.That's a hell of a New Year's resolution. Maybe I should just lose some weight.Happy New Year, dear reader!"},

Now that we are on winter break, it is time for Johnny to disappear into sculpture land. I got a lot of shit to do. But before I go...I've got a glass casting in the kiln. I've got shadow boxes to make for the ongoing mechanicule series. And I'm starting on the figurative logical extension of the mechnicule series, which ties back to the other figurative works, and so I'm world-building as well. I'm hesitant to show the waxes as the whole thing isn't done, and waxes are difficult to photograph, but here's a preview:The narrative, here, going back to the mechanicules, is that those milliscopic little guys were ubiquitous logistical support for even larger robots (actually the REAL mechanicules are turning out to be proteins, and if I could start over I'd switch to biology because clearly molecular life manipulation is the ultimate in the toy department). The narrative is, once robots and machine reach the complexity of us biological fragiles, it's stands to reason they get even more temperamental than machines are now. So, in my scenario, you got a lazy old cow of a robot being tended to by a human. And the human is kind of dressed up in a combination protective armor / upholstered somatic mimicry suit. The humans wear soothing tentacle gloves, a haptic interface to not freak out the robot. Think of the human as kind of like a beekeeper and you get the idea. There will be two humans tending to this mechanical bee/cow. One is a pusher and the other the puller. This is the pusher:He will be cast solid. His hat will be cast separately and welded on later (thus the hole in the hat). Here's the pusher's pointy head the hat will be welded to:The lazy cow will be cast in three pieces and welded together.  I'm working on the puller, or will be when I'm done typing this.SUNDAY UPDATE: I'm done with the puller. Here is the completed scenario:\"The Stockmen\"The puller will be tugging on the lazy bee/cow's tentacle, and this tentacle and figure cast together and will be welded onto lazy bee/cow after casting:The plan is to do three action dioramas using the figures and big robots. You'll see in January when I'm done. Other things.Charlie Stross wants #bitcoin to die in a fire. Can't really blame him for the sentiment. The one thing I would note is that bitcoin has been latched onto by libertarians. If you read the original paper, bitcoin was supposed to be about a peer-to-peer online currency that didn't require the reputation of an issuing institution to justify trust in it. Yeah, well, that went out the window with the bitcoin wallet, didn't it?Here's the deal as I see it. It's a commodity. It's going through a series of pumps and dumps. It's flawed. Better designs will appear. The point that is lost on libertarians is bitcoin is not anonymous, and does require an institution to justify trust in it. Also, what libertarians don't get is that free markets are neither efficient nor rational. But, free markets are more robust to corruption and deceit than, say, central planning. In fact, deceit, or as some libertarians like to call it, force and fraud, is the salient feature of capitalism. Screw your neighbor, and caveat emptor are the fundamental credos of business. So, bitcoin as a commodity, or some future version of it, will have a place in the market, seeing as more bad guys than good hold wallets. But it would be nice if a fire broke out just to rattle some ideological cages. Or at least to see what the spam- and malware bots, who now constitute the majority of Internet denizens, do with it. Onward!A colleague of mine shocked me with the statement that she doesn't want the Dream Act to go forward, because the immigrant workers aren't legal and deserve no protection under the law. Rather than point out that regular Americans constantly flaunt the law, i noted that I would prefer these migrant workers over most Americans. After all, they displayed commendable risk-taking behaviors. They have giant, giant balls compared to, say, hedge fund billionaires, who have never in their life risked life and livelihood with such a gamble. I want these courageous kinds of people in America. And finally...If I don't get around to posting before the New Year, I'd just to like to thank everyone who reads my shit, and comments. I enjoy the comments and more often than not they provide a great source for more essays. So I thank all of you for that. And on that note...UBJ mentioned John Henry in relation to robots and art and humans and technology and displacement and obsolescence and the P versus NP problem. Or at least those are my associations with this whole subject that started with 3D printing. You may have different themes and issues to explore.I would point out that Art is an NP-hard problem, I think, and so less-than-optimal robot approximations exist to solve it, but, not surprisingly, that's what humans do too. Actually, that's what the universe does as well, as far as I can tell.But I digress.John Henry was put in a contest with a steam powered machine competitor.John Henry won.And then he died. Well, he still won, right? Man versus machine. But no, put in context, man versus other men with machines. Far as I know, no machine yet has a brain that can utilize other machines, and even when that machine with a brain shows up, it will still have its origin point with man.Point being, as I've said before: people still make the best robots. Oh, right, and... Santa! The REAL Santa.That's not Santa! That's Santa!"},

{"title": "Newtown", "date": "Wednesday, December 18, 2013", "text": "I avoided writing anything on the anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre mainly because I anticipated another media circus surrounding the anniversary.I've written before about guns and gun safety. I don't think I need to repeat myself. I would like to point out that there are other countries out there that have almost as many guns per capita as the US of A, but manage not to kill their babies with them.The 2nd amendment is under no danger of disappearing. Americans who own guns should - despite all of their public pant-shitting and whining - not worry that their guns will be confiscated. Guns are here to stay. Which means idiots with guns are here to stay. (And really, this whole \"assault on our freedoms\" horseshit is just a lament that white people don't get to do whatever they want anymore).Yeah, I know the statistics that more people drown in pools than die from firearms. That only suggests to me that people who are completely irresponsible with something as relatively benign as a swimming pool probably are not going to do well with a firearm. Or so I can hope.I do hope that firearm deaths go up. I do hope more children shoot themselves with loaded and unsecured firearms left casually about the house. I do hope that hunting accidents go up; that homeowners mistake their loved ones for intruders, that more ricochets take out eyes; and pierce skulls, and maim limbs from nonchalant target shooters plinking at the wrong kind of targets. Because, as far as I can see, the threshold of twenty children being slaughtered - children that most people would agree are at the cutest stage of life - apparently isn't enough for gun safety to be taken seriously by Americans.So, I'll just close this with a story. Honestly at this stage, I can't tell you if this is the way events went down. But it's the way I remember it. My role in it all of it might sound like bragging, but I wasn't purposely trying to do what I did. I was just reacting to the situation. I asked my brother about the incident, and he remembers it the way I do, so, I'll just tell the story.About thirty years ago, a bunch of us went out to target shooting, which we did regularly. We used a friend's relative's land to go shooting in. The property is situated in what is called the Valparaiso moraine, a line south of Lake Michigan where a glacier had bulldozed Canada into a set of rolling hills and deep valleys. The property had deep cut creeks running through the accumulated clay and sand, thickly grown over with oak, elm and maple. The steep clay banks made for perfect backdrops to shoot into.This being Indiana, practically every creek bed had abandoned hillbilly trash in it: old trucks, cars, washing machines, sofas, cupboards, stoves, you name it. Plenty of targets to shoot at.So, we are out for a pleasant afternoon of shooting, when, to the east we hear shots, and then then the sound of buckshot flying through the leaves above our heads. Bird hunters.We shout out that there's people over this way. But we are all relatively safe, seeing as they are shooting up into the trees and we are down in a creek bed. Unfortunately, our friend's brother is with us, and he is not only a hothead, but an idiot.I should tell you, this guy has always had a short fuse, was always kind of weaselly shrimp with a chip on his shoulder, had just recently been discharged from the Army, which did it's best to fuck his head up even more than what it was. (This is not to disparage the Army. I merely note that their methods seem to exaggerate qualities already inherent in their charges, and in this case they exaggerated the guy into a full-blown asshole).Now, you can rightly say that WE were the idiots for letting him go shooting with us. And, sigh, you'd be justified in that statement.In any case, the hothead goes charging off east with shotgun in hand. The rest of us look stupidly at each for a moment, and then all at the same time realize that this motherfucker is going to confront the birdhunters. \"Oh, shit\" we all say, and go charging off after the hothead. One of us, not me, had the presence of mind to order us to leave our weapons behind. Which we did.So, we run, and after not too far a distance, I come over a ridge to find two hunters standing terrified as this fuckhead - our fuckhead - has his shotgun pointed at them screaming incoherent shit about private property. With my appearance over the ridge, one of the hunters starts to bring up his rifle in reaction.I throw up my hands, and shout \"Whoa! Whoa!\" Fuckhead is still screaming at these guys, and without thinking about it, I get my unarmed body in between the fuckhead and the hunters with my hands still up. I guess it was not very smart to do that, but I saw an instant wave of relief from the hunter's when I interposed myself. Still, not fucking smart at all, and way beyond faith that the idiot doesn't send a shotgun blast into my back.It was this point that the fuckhead's brother and the rest of crew show up, and someone, not me, says \"Get that shotgun out of that fucker's hands, will you?\"So, crisis averted. The brother and I apologize profusely, which doesn't help because now the hunters are angry at the harrowing encounter they've just been through. They want to bitch and berate us, and I say \"Don't make things worse. Just turn around and go\". And you're welcome.That's the way I remember it. Like I say, I was not thinking, and things could have just have easily gone much, much worse as they did."},
{"title": "Sampling", "date": "Monday, December 16, 2013", "text": "Previously on Random Walks....Zina Saunders commented:\"Scary to consider the advent of laser printing. Have you ever tried it? Your quandary reminds me a bit of my own when it became clear, about 10 or 15 years ago, that everything was going digital in illustration. It terrified me, infuriated me, I resisted mightily (mainly because I couldn't imagine being able to work digitally, plus the digital work I was aware of was, frankly, pretty awful). But I hunkered down and tried to learn how to do it, and now I love the freedom and possibilities it opened up for me.Not saying your situation and what you face is similar, just rambling...\"Not rambling at all, and worth exploring, involving an increasingly expansive scope. My first exposure to 3D printing was around the late '90s, I think, back when it was still called rapid prototyping. A guy had one of the first printers, and printed off a plastic cupboard knob, which looked like a cheap plastic knob and took all day to print. At the time, I said, \"that is completely retarded\". Such is the case with anything new, right? WTF? What's the point. We already have stuff that does that. More of a pain in the ass than a time saver. &c. &c...Flash forward a dozen or so years, and after reading news stories like the titanium jaw bone that was laser sintered to replace a woman's jaw lost to a bone infection, I says \"Ah, Okay. So that's what it's all for. I'm the retarded one\". Of course, I wasn't completely stupid about it. I could see the utility of it. I had considered getting a 3D printer a few years back, but I couldn't see spending a minimum of $25, 000 to make stuff that I could make for much, much less. I understand it will be the future for a lot of things, and when the price comes down a LOT more, I'll probably buy one.I have contributed to a kickstarter project for the much more important front end of the 3D printer process: a cheap 3D scanner that let's you convert pictures into digital files of 3D objects (they are already out there, but I liked the one I helped to fund). Yes, so, youbethca! The freedom and opportunities now exist, not only for making manifest images in your mind into real objects, but - so, so much more - sampling of 3D objects in assembling digital bricolage. I mean the possibilities of what can be done give me a major metaphysical hard-on.True, this all has been out there for a long time, and I still look to the early dadaists for some of the best examples. Point being, what I'm doing by making molds of objects and churning out wax casts to be combined and joined into critters is exactly what you are talking about. A whole new world, a new universe opened up for exploration. Square that - or cube it - with access to all the digital files that have been sampled so far.So, now I will confess. I have a Whig's view of historiography (Whig as in Adam Smith, Hume, and Burke). I know that this is now a pejorative. It automatically puts me in the category of hopelessly naive, believing that things will continue to progress and get better. It's not a political philosophy, but a religious conviction. It suffers from the conservative's logical fallacy of trending - that things will continue as they are. I admit this failing. I know it is foolish, and yet I'll continue to believe it until circumstances adjust my behavior in another direction.As such, I have to assume that today's 3D printer is like yesterday's Gutenberg printing press. Which is to say: 1) we are still working through the consequences and impact of that printing press some 600 years later, and 2) we have to realize just how risibly primitive today's 3D printers are. \"Using an XY plotter and tube that poots out stinky plastic?\" WTF? Savages!\" will be the comment some fifty years from now. I suspect. Maybe even, \"Wow, they used lasers to sinter stuff? AH-ha-ha, why not stone hammers? Sheesh!\"Ah, which gets me to the other part of the fun. I am a big huge fan of nostalgia industries. If, like me, you have a Whig's view of the future, then you know that nostalgia industries is always going to experience big growth. It's always going to boom. (My definition of nostalgia industry is any human activity or artifact, that is supplanted by something more modern. Example: LPs).So, I do consider the nostalgia industries a guaranteed growth regime for all time to come because 1) there's always someone who picks it up as a hobby, 2) nothing we humans have ever done goes away.Ever. 1) is obvious, given that we are clever and curious monkeys and each of us has our individual quirks. So, let's look at 2). There is the obvious example of the LP boom, vinyl records are being made again, and styluses, and people like analog sound, but you also can find buggy whip manufacturers, and even, yes, stone knapping kit manufactures (in case you want to make a stone hand axe). The fact of the matter is, no matter how sophisticated and digital we become, we can't live entirely in our heads. We like, and need, things that can be handled, and that are part of the word, part of the natural world, that are simple, homely, and... real.You can use ArtRage on your iPad to paint me a picture, and your digital tool kit is much larger and more versatile to work with. And you can take that digital image, and use a 3D print bot to make an oil painting from it. And I'd be blown away by it. But I'm still gonna LOVE one done by hand (or a wood cut, or a pen and ink drawing). Some things are just too good to let them go away!So, even if I get myself a 3D metal caster or whatever it will be, I'll still be doing it the Old Skool way, the seven-thousand-year-old tried and true way as well. Or maybe mix and match the techniques in a analog/digital sampling. Fun!(P.S. Hey artists! LACMA has started up the old Art and Technology program! Get your shit together and submit a proposal! I'm going to!)"},

A pendant that was made from wax and invested in a flask Tuesday, burned out overnight Tuesday night, and spin cast Wednesday afternoon.

Two hours, plus, I don't know, an hour to create the digital image file for the printing? (sigh) I guess that's the future. How much would that cost? I mean, amortizing the computer and printer. More than my Old Skool method, so at least that's safe for a few years. Anyway, I showed it to one of the students, who said it was a combination sperm, octopus, peanut, and diving helmet.A chimera? Works for me.Oh, and I finally finished this guy, and I call him \"Blinky\". Can't really classify him as a mechanicule, so I'll throw him into the chimera bin as well."},
{"title": "Good Deeds", "date": "Wednesday, December 11, 2013", "text": "I'm feeling cheerful this morning, and I have to attribute my mood to my (very minor) good deed.Let me backtrack a bit. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, at one point we had twenty people, five dogs, and three cats in my brother's house. My niece commented - after about the seventh time the dogs went running through the room - about how many animals were in the house.After a moment, I replied \"I count twenty-eight animals\".She gave me a weird look.\"What? We're not animals?\" I asked. Of course we are animals.Mark Twain once said \"Man is the only animal that blushes. Or needs to\". My response to Mark is \"Actually, Man is the only animal that can choke on its own vomit. Or needs to\".Well, no seriously, Man is the only animal that looks for a difference between himself and other animals.I would have liked to have said that Man is the only animal that commits altruistic acts, but that's not true. Lots of other animals do that as well. But I would like to think that we do it a little more often, if only to each other, but sometimes to other animals, and these acts are what elevate us just a little bit above other animals. But then we blow all those points with all sorts of acts of cruelty.In any case, I try to do one good deed a day if can. Even if its just a little thing. Now, I don't all the courteous things we do in polite society as a good deed. It has to be something that inconveniences me in some way. That is, after all the defining quality of altruism: sacrifice.(I know Ayn Rand consider altruism a secular sin, but she was just creepy, so eff her).Anyway, I get ready for work, and my next door neighbor is standing next to his car. Not that this matters, but my next door neighbor is named Aaron, and his car is a giant gold Lincoln Continental. The car is so big and pimped out that it looks like it should have a nuclear reactor under the hood, and perhaps it does.Well, Aaron cannot get his driver's side back door to close and lock. We examine the mechanism. I figure because of the cold, it's frozen somehow, so I spray it down with WD-40. No luck. After about five minutes of this, I give up. I don't what's wrong with it. Aaron is quite frustrated, and as a result cannot think at all.\"What am I gonna do? I can't drive it with the door swinging open\".After staring at the door for a minute, I notice the seat belt.\"Hey, let's loop the seatbelt through the inside door handle. That will keep it closed for you to get it to a garage for them to look at it\".He stares at me for two seconds, and says \"That's very clever!\"We do so, and he is on his way.So, am I cheerful because I helped him out, or I got to solve a problem, or I got a compliment?I guess all three."},

{"title": "Attack Surface concluded", "date": "Monday, December 9, 2013", "text": "First off, I'd like to apologize for the low quality essays I've been pumping out lately. Being busy with other things isn't an excuse. It's true I am busy with other things, but I usually at least re-read the first draft (hardly ever get beyond a first draft), and so the essay does have my fully attention when I craft it.Going back and reading them, I'm embarrassed. Not only is the prose not very coherent, there are those annoying angry digressions and rants that, quite frankly, I thought were cute. And that cutesy bit of foul-mouthed prancing around adds nothing to the narrative - similar to the annoying digressions and diversions in a Quentin Tarantino film.I use that reference because I saw Django Unchained over weekend, as it finally made it onto the shelves of my local socialist book depository.What did I think? Eh. It was occasionally entertaining. My problem with Tarantino is he engages me, and then loses me. Since he just makes movies, I can ignore the cutesy little prancing digressions he throws in, knowing that eventually he will get back to the actual narration of the movie. But these digressions add nothing to the plot, or explain or enhance the characters, or alter the mood in any way. It's just Tarantino wanking off, and I'm beyond annoyed with it, and so just let my attention skim past it to the next good bit.So, there was a controversy when this movie came out, right? The movie was branded racist because a white director made use of the n-word entirely too much. Well, maybe he should have used the c-word. In fact, I think want to see the word \"bully\" replaced with the c-word. \"Bully\" just doesn't have any impact. However, if instead of saying \"You big bully!\" you said \"You cunt!\" that would produce the desired psychological effect, and really be more to the point.In any case, Tarantino suggested, in the opening minutes, that his movie was an homage to spaghetti westerns, what with the opening music, quick and annoying camera panning and angles, and the brief cameo of the original Django, but it was soon apparent that was the extent of the homage.If it was a homage to any movie, I would have picked the original Michael Wilson and Rod Serling scripted \"Planet of the Apes\". No, think about it. Here Django is playing the part of Charlton Heston's Taylor, an alien stranded on a planet infested with brutish, stupid, violent creatures. They object to his very existence, and, even when he proves to be superior to the apes, they still treat him as less than ape. Sound familiar? The difference, of course, is that Tarantino wanted to be cute, so there is a lot of gratuitous violence and broad, clumsy characterizations. But you get the idea.Speaking of the Planet of the Apes, I would note two news items. The first one observes that language may predate humans. No surprise to me. Very sophisticated tools, and so by inference the use of language to instruct in the making of such tools, existed prior to H. sap. Jared Diamond has often been cited language as the reason for the The Great Leap Forward some 40,000 years ago, when apparently human culture really took off.As I've noted before, Diamond (like most popularizers) is mostly full of shit, and language is overrated. Meaning 1) the evidence is incomplete, lots of the artifacts probably existed long before the hypothesized \"Great Leap\", you just got to dig better, and 2) language in and of itself is easily acquired and used by some pretty stupid people, so I think something else much more sophisticated was going on to explain the Great Leap, if it did indeed occur.The second new item sheds a bit more light on the Denisovans, who, it would seem, have entered the picture as part of the many hominids that existed prior to, and probably contemporaneous with, H. sap. It's starting to look like, with all the different hominids around, that some 200-400,000 years ago, it was a lot like Middle Earth, with ogres and trolls and elves and hobbits and dwarves running around. Which, of course, begs the question \"Are we Mordor?\"And speaking of Mordor (and going by just the movies mind you, since I never the read books) doesn't it seem rather silly for Sauron to fashion these rings of power, in turn controlled by the One Ring, hand them out to the various races of Middle Earth, who basically can't wait to greedily and lustfully slip them on their fingers, and thus become enthralled and enslaved by the will of Sauron... and then, after crafting together a very clever and subtle and devilish plan of enslaving the whole world with basically zero effort, Sauron goes all neolithic, wastes enormous amounts of blood and treasure, builds up and maintains vast armies to engage in primitive genocide, rapine, slaughter, and pillage to achieve ends in the most expensive manner possible?Does this strike anyone else as fucking stupid? It reminds of the behaviors we got from the likes of Hitler and Hirohito. Actually taking physical land and killing off opposing tribes is so... Stone Age, man! Why not try gunboat diplomacy, virtual empire, political and cultural dominance, hegemony? Works as well or better and with decidedly less effort since, if you craft it seductively, people want to be enslaved by you!   Look at social media!And so, here we are back at attack surfaces. The big problem, as I said before, with attack surfaces is that your own resources are turned against you. And, of course, since you make these resources available for a reason, this is why they are vulnerable. As such, according to game theory, your best bet is a dynamic defense. With software, or all other kinds of ware (since, inevitably, All is Information, and Information is Physical), it's a tossup between security and usability. One can, after all, shift an attack surface, make it a moving target (as Life does, as the smarter humans do).But, the problem there is you want your resources to be usable (and without all that change and revamping and documenting and updating). Not only that, but if you shift your surface, you may suppress old attacks, but you inevitably invite new attacks. What to do?Well, modularity and redundancy come to mind. Modularity gives you the advantage of resource stability, with only minor tweaks and changes to some components. Redundancy is also a nice feature, as, if you find one resource stria or lamina compromised, you swap over and continue on.(Examples of the former: combination locks, antigens, etc. ) (Examples of the latter: The HoChi Minh trail).Well, you can see where this is going right? It begs the question is there an optimal moving target defense strategy? Short answer? No. And forget about game theory for the answer.Longer answer? Yes, but annoyingly, it requires cooperation with the attacker.See above."},
{"title": "Attack Surface continued", "date": "Friday, December 6, 2013", "text": "This is going to be all over the place, so, sorry in advance.I've said this before, but... Over time, hardware breaks down, but software gets better.Having worked on both, I can testify that hardware needs a lot more fixing and monitoring than software. Software, yes, you are on the lookout for the inevitable bugs, which, over time, will do a Dragon King event on you. But hardware, working on all that teaches you (faster) that the world is dynamic in a way that supporting software will not teach you in a timely manner.And so, it is not surprising that software folks would use the term \"attack surface\", kind of implying a static defense, like a Maginot line or the Great Wall of China, that once you identify all of the chinks in the armor, you are good to go forever. And it suggests a old fashioned way of thinking about things, a neolithic or medieval or pre-modern attitude towards how things work. Which is surprising and kind of counter-intutive, but I think it applies.Want a good example? Let me start by defining pre-modern as anything prior to 1848. Why that date? Because I consider 1848 the beginning of the modern age, and not just because of the failed revolutions in Europe, with the concomitant underground percolation of liberalism and nationalism (and it's inadvertent export to the USA), but rather the founding of the first modern scientific institutions (primarily with the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna). It is also a post-industrial-revolution date, but also pre-contemporary-corporate-structure date.Under this definition, the United States Constitution is a pre-modern document. Wait! You might say, the document has amendments, thus making it a, not a static, but a dynamic document.True. True. But keep in mind that I'm thinking of the Constitution, and all of the rather unwritten laws of governance that occur within and between the three branches, as software. And the machine code of all of these instruments of government, Lockean though they be in intent, are all decidedly Hobbesian in practice, and thus, pre-modern. And as such, I would propose that the practice of governance based upon this software (which teatards revere as holy scripture) is woefully inadequate for modern times.Primarily in that it does nothing to enhance or support individual freedoms (and note that I did not use the term liberty, and thus, distinguish the difference between omissions and commissions). Now, is this the fault of the original software, or the current hacks that are used based upon the original software (and isn't it sad, don't you think, that one of the primo badass big dick daddio hackers of this code is the chinless reptile Mitch McConnell?)Consider that, according to various institutions such as stateoftheworldliberty.org, countries such as those following the Nordic welfare model, or countries that were once Soviet satellites, or even traditional monarchies (like, respectively, Finland, Latvia, United Kingdom), have more practical individual freedoms than those that are enjoyed in the US. I would submit that this is so due to these nations updating and rewriting their constitutions. Keeping their software up to snuff, if you will.Regardless, the point of this that one should (if not occasionally change the nation's genome) at least be open to a little manipulation of gene expressions, which even the lowliest bacteria can accomplish.Getting me back to attack surfaces. I don't believe in attack surfaces. I believe in attack laminae, which would be the dynamic striations, the active and changing portions of this so-called surface. As such the entry points more appropriately include a time component.Back to the cell surface analogy. Some toxins are multi-part molecules. One molecule may force a pore in the membrane open, a foot in the door if you will, while another part gains entry to muck up the works. Alternately, since protein channels are slippery critters, one molecule may keep the first from being dislodged, and then allow ion exchange to do the rest (this is employed in some forms of snake venom). But here is the thing. Not all protein channels are vulnerable all the time. There is a window of opportunity when they may be violated. Similar things can happen at many levels of cell membrane biology, and thus the idea of striae or laminae.Where was I going? Okay, consider the defeat of both the French and Americans in Vietnam. Here you had a situation where a materially more powerful enemy is overcome by political superiority, through the mobilization and organization of the mass of people in a total and protracted engagement. The idea being that, it is possible to achieve a change of war venue and determine its outcome away from the battlefield.  This is more than just a test of wills and commitment, this is a combination of resilient innovation coupled to massively parallel inundation of any all perceived or real entry points.This isn't your medieval/neolithic physical occupation of land and people's, this is perceived power projection, virtual empire, perceiving the protocols beneath the surface events, and hacking the situation to your advantage. Or to it in a different light:#OccupyWallStreet?Fuck that!#HackWallStreet"},
{"title": "Attack Surface", "date": "Thursday, December 5, 2013", "text": "I'm sure this phrase, or a variant of it, has been around for some time, but I only recently heard it. Maybe three or four times in the span of as many weeks.According to the internet, an attack surface is a software term of entry points to a program or system that either a program or black-hat hacker can utilize. The earliest citation I can find for the phrase goes back to 2004. I'm sure it has been used before this, but the concept of attack surface is about four billion years old and dates back to the development of the cell and its membrane. Think of all the methods of exploitation used by life: either through brute force penetration by viral bacteriophages, or entry through a protein channel, or corruption or dissolution of a transmembrane protein, or disassembly of the cell wall itself. Each in turn has some software equivalent - or soon will.Perhaps a better way to think of an attack surface is not from the defender's point of view (one has to assume some vulnerability always exists), but rather the amount of effort required for each attack method. In which case, we have something more akin to an aggression vector, or an aggression tensor, where the amount of work done is taken into account in attacking entry points.Which gets me to bitcoin. Everyone and his uncle seems to be obsessing over the value of this, what with all the frothing going on right now. But bitcoin isn't really what this is about is it? It's the bitcoin wallet that is important.You know, at first, I was a little annoyed by all the bitcoin mining, because I knew that eventually the egalitarian nature of the enterprise would become subject to the Pareto distribution - those who aggregated first, or who had resources and capital first, would win out over the little guys. As I understand it, a bitcoin is \"mined\" by the number of hashes (a computer operation) it takes to solve a cryptographic algorithm, the number of which increases with value (the difficulty increases as the value increases). If you've been paying attention, you'll notice that the value has increased exponentially lately, and thus the computing power required to mine coins has increased commensurately.People have pointed out the insane amount of energy, hardware, and specialization that has taken place in the effort to mine bitcoins. Yes, it's a waste, but once I thought about it for awhile, I said, eh, so what? I mean, how much energy, hardware, and specialization has been spent on video games, or bad movies, or professional sports?It's not like all that computing power could have been used to crack any number of intractable problems, or used as Monte Carlo simulations for controlled fusion, or cancer research, or studies of the brain, or reducing poverty, hunger, disease and want... or any of the thousands of much more worthwhile scientific endeavors that exist, because, you know, Freedumb!And I don't care that economists and banker and financial types are wasting their time and wringing their hands over bitcoin. It's just another commodity, ultimately nothing more than a different form of physical information, frozen CO2 and human ingenuity, a result of the combustion of fossil fuel and fossil oxygen, and you would be hardpressed to make it any more than that without human symbolism and meaning. (And how many commodities - other than food - are really truly important for human existence)?Yeah, but Freedumb! the hackers and libertarians and other impractical types cry. The biggest problem, they say, is that the governments will attempt to control this and any other form of crypto currency. Eh, and so what? Is that really the problem?No, the problem of the attack surface of bitcoin, which Satoshi Nakamoto* himself pointed out on the very first page of the technical  paper he wrote about bitcoin, is:\"The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes\".There you go.  If enough corrupt wallets are out there, bitcoin will never be an instrument of freedumb!.Time for a redesign? And a little bit of tweaking, maybe?Remember folks, NOTHING is ever done right the first time.* \"Who is Satochi Nakamoto?\" might be the new \"Who is John Galt?\" which, honestly, was congenitally stupid from the get-go."},
{"title": "Doing the Tourist Thing", "date": "Wednesday, December 4, 2013", "text": "Did the holiday thing back in Indiana, and part of the deal was a tour of Chicago. My younger niece and family were in from Kansas City, and they had (she had, obviously, being from here) never been to Chicago. So, Friday we all went up to see the sights.On the drive up, I was informed by my great-niece (my elder niece's daughter) that twerking was how babies were made. Women just kept on twerking until the baby popped out. I mentioned to my elder niece that perhaps it was time for The Talk. She informed me they had had The Talk, but that my great-niece just liked her version better. Okay fine. What happens when boys twerk, or do I want to know?I don't.So, the big deal was my younger niece's stepson (what do I call him, as they're not married but having a baby, so what's the status? I'll just call him the kid) had never been to the Sears Willis Tower. So, that was on the itinerary after we had done the Millennium Park/Mag Mile/ Chicago style pizza thing.Which we did, and it was a huge amount of fun, but by the time we get down to the Sears Willis Tower, it's getting on close to sunset.I should preface this story with the fact that the night before I had suggested we get advance tickets for the Sears Willis Tower skydeck. You can gain access to the skydeck for $18, or get the deluxe express dealio for $40. My brother calculating ten people @ $40 per put the kibosh on that idea.So, when we get to the Sears Willis Tower, at near sunset, we are told it is a two and one half hour wait to get access to the skydeck. Fine, we say, give us tickets for the express. No problem, they say, that will be $89 per person. What? It's $40 online! Yes, advance tickets online are $40. Not when you show up.Well, eff all that. So, the drive back, the kid is not going to let us forget that we went all the way to Chicago and he did not get to go to the top of the Sears Willis Tower.  And my niece informed me that he would remind them of this circumstance all the fucking way back to Kansas City, and then some.So.... Saturday morning, early, my brother, niece's boyfriend/partner/almost-a-husband, and the kid drive up to the Sear Willis Tower, have a lot money extracted by getting pictures taken, souvenirs bought, etc. Kid is happy, my brother is the hero.Of course, I know altruism is only a partial motivation. As the kid would not let it drop, shit rolls downhill and his daughter would never let it drop. These familial dysfunction things must be nipped in the bud.There you go. I have nothing personal to report from all that. I'm thankful for being completely clueless about what goes on in my family. That's my Thanksgiving thankful thing.Oh, wait. I did cast two glass pieces at the college over the holiday. I'm submitting them to Bullseye's Emerge show.Here's some pics:"},

You know, when you had a bad feeling or something wasn't quite right, and you ignored that and got into trouble?But how many times has the gut been wrong? We don't remember. The gut (call it instinct, intuition, what have you), by nature of being a soft, squishy defenseless mess protected at most by some fat, maybe a little muscle, is cowardly, and will never be comfortable with bold action.Nevertheless, I do listen to my gut feelings, and lately my gut has been telling me to move to Mexico.Which is weird, don't you think?The whole thing started when I came to the realization, that all other factors being what they are, the really important thing boils down to global warming. It's coming. It's accelerating, and it's getting to the point where the acceleration will accelerate into the shock zone.This feeling stems from my knowledge of past climate variation. Which, yes, I know, is trending, induction, inference, unscientific. The fact remains that in the past climates can change like the flip of a switch, that heating or cooling can catastrophically take place on the order of decades or years.No, I don't think we will have anything biblical, but I do think, when it happens, it will be a rapid phase change. And you can only prepare so much, but really it's all about location, location, location.So, why not stay where I am? Chicago has lots of water, the Great Lakes undoubtedly will be stick around for awhile. Yes, but North America traditionally is an arid place. Places like the south and the west are kind of screwed if the rain belts move north as predicted. So it will be more than cities like Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Dallas, San Antonio, Denver that are doomed. The Great Plains will return to the Sahara they were one thousand years ago, and not just the plains cities like Topeka or Wichita, but Kansas City, St. Louis, Memphis, Des Moines are doomed as well. Climate studies also suggest decade-long droughts in the southeast United States, so basically right off anyone below the Mason-Dixon line.And where will all those people go? Where the water is, I guess. So, the Great Lakes may not be such a  nice place to be.I had originally thought, well, maybe move to Canada, or Greenland, or Scandinavia. But my feeling is, tropical diseases are going to like wildfire through the mosquito and no-see-ums and tick population and you are going to see a lot of very white northern peoples die of exotic diseases and parasites. Plus, my guess is, with the melt, it's just going to be an awful swamp. Just the form of jungle living that white people don't take to so well.Alright, so why Mexico? Well, it's even more specific than that. My gut is telling me to go to the Sierra Madre del Sur. Why? I don't know the region. I look on a map, I can see the states Michoacan, Guerrero, Oaxaca, the city of Acapulco, but I've never been there. I don't know the peoples. I don't know Spanish. I don't know the indigenous languages there.I do know it will not suffer for rainfall. It has one of the (still) most diverse and thriving ecosystems in the world. In fact, Mexico as a whole still has a well preserved and very diverse ecology -  one of the most important on the planet.More importantly, the people there are subsistence survivors. When you compare them to their anglo neighbors up north, they are much tougher and more likely to survive through rough times. Let's face its, the anglo culture of the United States has always been an exploiter culture, and has never really had to rough it in a way that exploited peoples have. They are just more likely to survive, period, in a way that Americans or Canadians will not. So that is another factor.I don't know. I guess it would help to visit the damn place, don't you think? But I have to wonder why my gut says go south when all signs point north?(Oh, and by the way, after reading about the latest caper that the rich people's advisers have come up with - freeports to stash all their stuff - I have a desire to crash a fully fueled unmanned jumbo jet plane into one of these swank warehouses, or find me bunker buster. Sour Grapes? Or ahead of my time?)"},

Actually, no, my eldest student is 91, but she hasn't cast any metal with me this year, and probably never again. She's getting old.Anyway, my eldest student has been making needles and pins and other tailoring instrumentation for about, well, as long as I've been at the college. His father was a tailor and his mother was seamstress. I know that like I'm starting in on the Dozens, but that's what they were. The needle he fashioned out of wax was turned around so that the point goes back through the eye.In any case, I documented his needle because I failed to rig it properly. I'm a big fan of public admissions of mistakes, not only because you learn may something from my mistake, but I learn something by properly formulating what went wrong. This is the very essence of what Open Source is about. So here we have it:As you can see, the aluminum froze out in two spots. One spot actually joined, but then was torn apart when the metal and investment cooled, producing what is known as a heat tear (tear as in torn, not tear drop). The as the metal cooled, it condensed faster than the silica investment (the white stuff). The unyielding investment, under compression, won out over the metal under tension. In the other spot, the aluminum flow simply did not meet. My guess is insufficient hydraulic pressure to drive out the air. Here's another view angle, and as you can see, the runner feeding the needle is almost level with the pouring cup.The solution to all this? There should have been two additional runners at right angles to the two existing feed runners. Unlike bronze, the weight of the aluminum was insufficient to force enough metal through the feed runners. Also, a vent would have helped to eliminated trapped air, which also was a problem. So, metals are different animals, and go figure.My youngest student managed to cast her Greek helmet, or faux Greek helmet.It weighs 18 lbs.

Throw in the fact that I get a tax credit for self-employed medical costs, which means, if you subtract that credit out from what I shell out to BCBS of Illinois, I've been paying about one hundred dollars a year for my health insurance. Oh, yeah, did I also mention I'm one of the people who had their insurance cancelled by BCBS of Illinois, and that they offered up a new plan for me?Well, that's now changed. I recently completed my application for medical insurance through the healthcare.gov website.Wait, what? I thought that website was broken, not working? Yeah, well, it worked for me. What's your fucking problem? I tried it out this past Thursday, 11/ 14, and it wouldn't even let me create a user id. Tried it again on Friday 11/15, and I could.So, I walked my way through the website, and it was no more annoying that completing my tax returns, and actually took less time than that. Nothing crashed. Nothing went kablooey. I had to repeat a few steps, as clearly the private contractor who set up the front end has a sense of humor the way Ikea does.But it certainly wasn't a nightmare, or any more intrusive than some right wing drama queens have presented. I did not, for example, need to submit a blood sample, or type in my maternal great-grandmother's maiden name, or reveal my most private unsavory habit. For those of you worried about releasing information already obtained by the government anyway, all I can say is, are you intellectually disabled in some fashion?Now, granted, the Obama administration deserves all the crap you want to foist on it for the website. There really is absolutely no excuse that it didn't work flawlessly the first time out. Part of the blame I figure goes to the President himself, what with his Reaganesque \"don't bother me with the details\" approach to managing things, the whole mahalo hawaii light up another one mindset, or the Harvard law school \"I'm too fucking smart for this thing not to work\" mindset. It really is a clusterfuck that needs to get fixed.But may I remind you that \"clusterfuck\" is America's middle name?Seriously? I mean, a country who's most famous war hero, John Wayne, never served? A country who is determined to keep an acre of grass at it's embassy green and lush in Iraq? A coutnry that got it's ass legitimately kicked by Vietnam? (More on that in a minute).So, Friday, I put in all my information for the application, view my insurance options, and select the same company I have now, BCBS of Illinois, and I am taking advantage of the tax credit premium. This means that I am getting BETTER coverage than I had for one third the cost. Let me repeat that for you.I am getting BETTER coverage than I had for one third the cost.Now, if I were to advertise this fact within the newsfeed commentariat, with all the paid trolls, waterheads, or just your average ill-informed dumbshit American yokel that infests those places, I'd be branded as a either a liar, or retarded, or, a propagandist or all three. But nope. It's the truth.Which gets me to Vietnam and General Giap. I'm reading a biography on Giap. He was the guy who generalled two victories for Communist Vietnam, first against France, and then the US of A. I admire the guy, and figure we've something to learn from him. My mention of this fact got me branded a traitor by a teatard Vietnam-vet-who-saw-action-in-a-Saigon-whorehouse-sour-grapes loser. My response was 1) why feel ashamed for getting your ass kicked by the best?  and 2) no sir, I am not a traitor. Now, Robert E. Lee, he was a traitor.The sour grapes response from the teatard generation, those right wing losers who really should just let it go, was to produce a lie that Giap once said Vietnam was two weeks away from surrendering. That's a fucking lie. It's the kind lie that makes me want to stab the faces of the promoters of this lie with a barbecue fork duct taped to a broken mop handle.* What is true is that the United States won every major battle in Vietnam, and yet lost the war. You don't think there's something valuable to learn there? I do.First and foremost, what I got out of it was, a lesson that is passed down from that real-life monster Mao Tse Tung through Uncle Ho, to General Giap is that if guerrilla fighters are fish, then the peasants are the water. If you do not have the support of the peasants, you are doomed.So,what's happening now with the civil war for the struggle for the hearts and minds of the American peasants? You got your slick right wing lies being peddled top down by PR firms and billionaires who want nothing more than feudalism. Because it's easy to win that game of Monopoly, steal the rest of the money when the peasants are powerless. To do that, you need a cult, a cult where the Founding Fathers are semi-divine, and the words of the Constitution is from on high.The left, on the other hand, is doing a really terrible job. They really should start reading up on the political infrastructure, the near Hebbian web of redundancies that, even today, modern Vietnamese would be hard-pressed to explain, save for the most effective explanation, which is that it worked.I think the left is hesitant to go full bore tapping into the working class rage against the banksters mainly because that ends up all pitchforks and torches and French revolution, or maybe worse 1840s failed revolution. And people are also culturally bred into the fiction of the antisocial rugged independent, which, when we had a frontier, was a convenient fiction. But seeing as we haven't had a frontier since the 1890s, is it any small coincidence that those in power have ceded some progressive scraps towards the populace, knowing the alternative was armed revolt?But there is a lot to be said for stressing the positives of community, of means of reconciliation other than the infantile 2nd amendment means which seem all the rage nowadays. Which of course is why I'm reading up on General Giap. Just in case.In the meantime, operating under the assumption that I should try and take advantage of the situation until falls down and goes boom, I'm taking advantage of this government healthcare program as best I can.If you want to call me a moocher, go ahead. The only logical response to that is, \"Fuck you too, and then go look in the mirror you fucking clueless (or lying hypocrite) fellow moocher!\" Anyway, we already have socialized medicine.Because in today's modern world, here in the US of A, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who's entire fucking existence was not subsidized by the Federal government.*Yes, I stole that. The circumstances surrounding that phrase were less than utopian, but it's a great phrase and I proudly stole it."},

My thinking is, why would we want them? If they want to secede, go for it, but don't expect help from the rest of us.

Since I like maps, here's something interesting:And then the Niobrara oil basin of fracking opportunities:Coincidence? Doubt it, because I've been to that part of the nation, and the atmosphere is not so much oxygen as cow shit, and there's not much there otherwise.My guess is, given the increasing centripetal forces towards Balkanization, America's epitaph will be \"Ex uno, plures\", and honestly, if it happens, good riddance. Too many dumb shit-covered - proudly shit-covered - rednecks anyway. Best that we just wither up and get stupid and die. It'll start with Texas, given they've used up all their groundwater on fracking, and we water-rich denizens of the Great lakes will just point at them and laugh. (Provided, of course, we are not so stupid to sell our water rights to the oil companies, which, according to the map, oops!)But anyway, when Balkanization comes, learn Spanish, Texans, Mexico may be your only hope.Other things. Why are so many of the world's foremost intellectuals such... dumbasses? Richard Dawkins, called by some (not by me) the world's foremost intellectual, can't seem to go a few months without publicly shitting his pants on Twitter. For that matter, he has given us some of the more embarrassing intellectual pant-shitting events. Should we start with memes? The concept of meme is as useful as phlogiston, the liquid calorific, animal spirits, the aether, and the vital pirinciple. (Actually, phlogiston, etc. is more useful in that they have been found to be null hypotheses which, by being abandoned as invalid, advanced our understanding. But memes, so ambiguously and mercurially defined, have yet to be proved to exist. Actually, I do think memes exist, provided we precisely define them as any noise-riddled little piece of turd fragment that can be brainlessly, mindlessly copied from idiot to idiot on the Internet.Then there's Dawkin's dishonesty about the God Delusion. First off all, pampered little dude, at this stage in our evolution, EVERYONE is deluded. Poking fun at a concept that most anyone beyond the age of eight has rejected is not exactly courageous or praiseworthy behavior. Maybe if you stuffed a little straw in that strawman it might appear more ominous, but... Secondly, the 20th century gave us LOTS of examples that religion is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the vast majority of bad behaviors. In fact, if we go by the numbers, atheists killed more people in the 20th century than the faithful!As far the existence or non-existence of God is concerned, Dawkins is painfully dishonest. (Me, I belong to the \"don't know, don't care' school of agnosticism, with the caveat that those universal constants sure do seem to be dialed in real tight to get our kind of Universe, not that that matters much, but...). Look, the statement \"God does not exist\" is a positive logical assertion, subject to the same burden of proof that deists labor under. Trying to weasel out by calling it a \"null hypothesis\" is a weasel rationalization. The luminiferous aether, the medium through which light waves wave is a null hypothesis. Eliminating it from the model of electromagnetic radiation is NOT the same as proving it's nonexistence. The Michaelson-Morley experiment proves the nonexistence of the aether.And since no logical argument or empirical observation can definitively prove or disprove the existence of God, atheists rely upon faith in their disbelief. So, don't give me any of shit about your superior intellectual or moral stance. It isn't there, and to insist so is either stupid or dishonest, you jerk.Do I really need to go off on Pinker, Diamond, Ferguson, etc. ? Dishonest? Attention whores? I mean, we as a species have barely been around long enough to get a handle on the universe, and our most effective tool (science and mathematics) is still in the toddler toy stage. This is not argument from ignorance, it's a statement of fact. And so I... evaluate, oh my yes!.... and reject most of this public meat-slapping passing off as intellectual discourse."},

{"title": "Do You Like To Watch?", "date": "Tuesday, October 29, 2013", "text": "One of my many duties as studio technician is occasional clay reclaim. The ceramics students dump their unused clay into garbage barrels, which we cover in water and let soak for a few days. (The leftover clay is sometimes dry or leather hard, and so we get it back to a mushy state, put it in a mixer, add dry powder, and then replenish the bins with the right consistency of bulk clay).We have found that, like making good cheese or beer, microbes are recruited to produce a slimy biofilm that makes the clay nice and gooshy, very nice for throwing bowls and such. The wet clay has a pleasant sulphurous smell, earthy like Grandma's country cellar. When we mix the clay, we siphon off the excess water. But since that water contains friendly microbes (archaea mainly, I think), we transfer the water from vat to vat to cultivate them. So, I'm doing that, and realizing, hey, here's another aspect of my tedious life I can document! So, when I'm doing this stuff, I'm on autopilot, like when you paint a room, and your mind wanders. And lately it's been wandering towards the idea of metaprogramming. Programming the programs, but without needing to know how to program the programs, just how to program the metaprograms,I'm starting to think the entire built world (us, plus Nature, plus all our shit) is nothing more than metaprogramming. Think about it. Even the simple ancient machines, the wheel and axle, the pulley, the wedge, the lever, the screw, and the incline plane, even these simple machines, when combined, automate so many tasks and allow for  further complexity, one built upon the next. Open up a VCR sometime and look at all the ancient machines in there. It's programmed materiality being used for even more programs.And it's extending to the IoT, the Internet of Things. Well, what is the Internet of Things? Simple. Take an object, slap some sensors on it, hook it up to wifi, and you have a device that will tell you all sorts of things about itself, it's environment, its users and abusers. Couple that with some sound deductive logic, and pretty soon, every one of your secret thoughts and dirty little habits is transmitted throughout the universe. Metaprogramming. The further embodiment within physical materiality of your already embodied minds. Consider that, right now, there are about 1.9 billion objects in the IoT universe, and that, by 2018 there will be 9 billion, which is more objects than is projected for all other devices combined (you know, mobiles, TVs, tablets, laptops, PCs, those goofy wristwatch thingies, etc).This can be a very good thing (sustainability, efficiency, cooperation and sharing of tools and toys), or a very bad thing (ubiquitous surveillance and universal law enforcement), but the point is this form of metaprogramming itself requires even more metaprogramming, which is what the Federal Trade Commission wants to do starting now, for, at least, the American internet of Things.What will happen? I'm guessing that, what with jugaads and chindogu, the black market, and the whole developed world leapfrogging past our shoddy 100-year-old infrastrcuture (70 years in Europe and Japan due to a little bombing creative destruction), that I expect big things to happen in the next ten years. Despite the naysayers about stagnation and low-hanging fruit, I don't see the Technium doing anything but accelerating faster and faster - provided, of course, we throw enough brains at it."},

{"title": "Casting Grey Iron", "date": "Monday, October 21, 2013", "text": "This past Friday, I cast iron. A former student had a ceramic shell mold he wanted to cast in iron. Could he use one of our foundry furnaces? Yes, he could. All he need do is provide the crucible and the metal. Would we be able to cast at such a high temperature? Yes, we would. Our furnaces can make it up to temperature to cast iron, which, on the high end for pouring, is around 2650F.My MIFCO B-150 furnace manual even has a chapter on casting iron. So, he shows the week before with a clay/graphite crucible and a couple of old steam radiators. I anneal the crucible in our kiln to red heat, to cure it nice and proper. But I send him away with the radiators to burn the paint off them, which obviously, given the thickness and age, has lead paint in there someplace. I don't want to know how or where he burns it off, it just can't be here. So, environmental no-no number one committed. I then tell him to break up the radiators with a sledge hammer, which he does.Friday, he arrives with two pickle buckets filled with cast iron pieces. We load the crucible, add in two pounds of graphite, and crank up the furnace. Slowly, over the next two and a half hours, we load pieces into the crucible. The interior of the furnace quickly becomes impossible to look into with the naked eye. Environmental no-no number two: we are going through a huge amount of natural gas to heat up some fifty pounds of iron. Had we done bronze, we would have cast around 150 lbs in the same amount of time.Problem: I cannot use our pyrometric lance on the molten metal to gauge the temperature. The tip of my lance, made of high temperature ceramic and platinum alloy, will melt and be destroyed if I do so. I am going to have to eyeball it. A difficult task to judge color while wearing cobalt blue welder's glasses.Well, I let it cook, and check it now and again. Here's the weird thing. It's the color and brightness of the sun in that furnace, well not really, but seems like it. And I notice, with the swirling of the exhaust gases that a molten yellow fluffy egg white meringue is flopping around in there. It looks exactly like that. Wow.So, my eyeball solution was to take a pencil rod of stainless, stick it down into the crucible, and pull it out. The first time I did it, the merinque (slag) stuck to the rod, and it looked like a red hot Q-tip. I banged the rod on the floor, and the slag broke off. I waited about ten minutes and repeated the procedure, and this time, there was red hot merinque ten inches up on the rod, and just a few yellow-white drops down by the tip of the bare rod. That meant, the rod had not wetted enough to attract molten metal, and the yellow drops were the kind of iron that we wanted.After placing the pre-heated mold in the pouring box filled with sand, we pulled the crucible out of the furnace. The crucible was yellow-white and sending off a shower of sparks just like a sparkler. The meringue slag quickly cooled to red hot and looked exactly like the top of a key lime pie, but browned. I smashed through the slag to the get to the metal, added a few ounces of flux to make it less plastic (flux is equal parts washing and baking soda). The metal and flux fizzed up rather alarmingly, but only for a moment, and then we poured the metal.You know, when working with bronze, it's all much cleaner and simpler - heat up, skim, pour. And the metal is gorgeous, but a pretty, kind of precious, kind of gorgeous. The metal is yellow-white to yellow-orange, but there is a nacreous quality to it, an iridescence, like mother-of-pearl. It's easy to get lost in it, and forget what you are doing and just watch the geometric cells form on the surface as the metal convects.But with molten iron, it is a solid honest no-nonsense pure yellow-white about it. None of this fairy dust and glitter shit that bronze pulls. It says, \"We got job to do and you better do it, and quick fucking around!\"So we did. The mold filled up very nicely indeed.Sorry no pictures of the pour, but once you've seen molten poured, it's all about the same. Not happy with that? Here you go:We had perhaps a third of a crucible left. which we dumped into the pouring box. The metal displaced the sand, sank down, and (later we found out) welded itself to the sheet metal bottom.7 lbs of cast iron welded to the floor of the boxWe had to cut the iron out of the boxLeftover stuff from the pour and cut from the mold(It should be noted, having some knowledge of just how much iron loves carbon, that molten iron and steel are like the worst kind of acid when it comes to working on the flesh. I therefore made it very plain from the beginning that if ANYTHING went wrong, we were to RUN AWAY, and not worry about the equipment and facilities. In retrospect, it's a very good thing we came through okay. All in all, a very pleasing first time encounter with quasi-catastrophe. Everything went better than well, considering we knew only a little of what we were doing)."},

Bright and shiny bauble?More like crystal meth and NASCAR, and this the latest spectacularly grisly car crash.\"This\" being, of course, the government shutdown. I am really ashamed at the amount of time I've wasted on this, and the amount of wasted text I expended in exchanging insults with the slack-jawed and the flipper-limbed within the comments sections of various newsfeeds.No, I am truly red faced and embarrassed at being manipulated so by the corporate overlords of our current crop of professional assholes politicians.When I think about it, doesn't the Yellow Snake Flag faction, I mean the Tea Party faction, of the GOP kind of remind you of a stupid, vicious leashed dog, as in the bullwhips and snapping and snarling dogs of massa? And don't the corporate feudal overlords, for all their protestations about not having complete control of the dog at the end of their leash, still have a firm hand on that leash?This all reminds me of when the Russians poisoned Viktor Yushchenko with dioxin. This was an open advertisement, a classic Neolithic tactic of We Can and Will Fuck With YOU! And how was the shutdown any different? The corporate feudal overlords, via their political stooges, arranged for Uncle Sam to get a love tap to the back of the head with a baseball bat, and a promise that, stick around folks, the next show is January! After Uncle Sam has had a chance to let the pain sink in, and had good think about it all.So, what did I get out all this, this shameful farrago we just went through? I propose one of two bumper sticker slogans. Here's the first:AMERICANS: NOT STUPID BY ACCIDENT!And the slightly more comprehendible second:AMERICANS: STUPID BY DESIGN!Tell me which you prefer. Me, I like the one that's harder to figure out.Okay, maybe one more:ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT DEMOCRACYThe ironic thing coming out of all this is, the flipper-limbed jellyheads that make up today's conservatives are now questioning the Whiteness ideological purity of the GOP. Are you sufficiently zealous, comrade? If not, you need to be purged!Enough! Another distraction is I'm trying to read through Charles Stross's Neptune's Brood, a space opera about bank fraud. I checked out the book from the library, got off to a very late start on it, am about halfway through, and it was due back at the library yesterday.Stross, it turns out, like me, was effected by David Graeber's Debt: The First 5,000 Years. (I really need to study up on the early city states of Mesopotamia). Charlie took it in a different way from me, but surprisingly, like parallel evolution, we both ended up thinking about the economy as one populated by self-replicating robots.Stross's robots, like in Blade Runner, are artificial humans, replicants, that more human than human, enhanced but still carbon-based and water-mediated. My robots are more prosaic, the current product of the four-billion-year-old nanotechnology project running on the terrestrial plane. You know. Us. But I did think that, in the future, given the way we are, there's room for improvements into Humans v 2.0. Which is what the Sept. 19, 2113 essay was about, where current humans are in the minority, and the artificial or enhanced versions are not particularly smarter, or at least, not individually smarter, but collectively so (kind of like what happens now).Rufosity!Story notes. When you got a case of world building that needs a good bit of rationalizing, you can't go far wrong with story notes. When I was writing up the footnotes, the Rufosity! entry got stuck in my head. I think partly I just really like that word.But I'm pretty sure I'm right that eventually the constabulary/military establishment will be absorbed into the entertainment industries, if they haven't been already. And any enforcement agencies will indeed be hyper-powerful androids in little girl form that can destroy whole cities with a snap of their fingers.Two reasons for this:1) Ubiquitous law enforcement is both riotously expensive and overkill (think about this: The US Navy seems to be doing the job of keeping trade lanes - not safe, but - clear and open, and with a force projection of only some 400 ships, versus some 100,000 cargo vessels armed to the teeth), and2) No ever expects little girls to be hyper-powerful androids that can destroy whole cities with a snap of their fingers. Hmm. okay, maybe -3) Localized power is easier to control, or at least manipulate. Besides, if you localize and distribute law enforcement entities, it takes time for them to arrive at trouble spots. Contrary to common sense, this is actually a good thing, since trouble spots have a way of sorting themselves out before you need to utterly destroy them, and I doubt you would use the resource of a hyper-powerful android for anything else but utter destruction. And the threat of utter destruction, which worked quite well for the Mongols, who borrowed this particular instrument out of the time-tested Neolithic cultural tool kit.Speaking of the Neolithic cultural package and rufosity, I'm not quite sure if I've ever mentioned the casual connection that can be found. Europe, which is a hodgepodge of all sorts of peoples and nomads and a mishmash of different cultures and migrations, with Wicker People and Beaker People moving to and fro, what with the always changing conditions in that shitty part of the world, still shows kind of a long-term ongoing colonization by Neolithic farmers. And typically you can throw those farmers into the R1b haplogroup. Here's a map of that haplogroup:And by coincidence, a map of people possessing the radioactive tag of red hair:Coincidence? maybe. Some say that red hair gene goes all the way back to Neanderthals. Well, if you'd ever seen pictures of my mother's father's side of the family, all clearly descended from Neanderthals, with their bony brows, prognathous faces and giant snaggly horse teeth, stringy black hair, looking like the trolls, ogres, and frost giants from Norway, you'd know different. So those gingers, yeah, interesting.Oh, and that, Neolithic cultural package? Groundstone tools, rectangular buildings, pottery, domesticated plants and animals, settled villages,... private property, oh, and, slavery and genocide.

It might be anecdotal, or it might the cumulative effects of radioactive fallout or hormone-mimicking toxic chemicals, but it sure seems like this behavior is reaching endemic proportions. One symptom (or cause) is an embrace of Rothbardian libertarianism or Austrian economic pseudo-philosophy.

Not because of the import of the question, or the knowledge that these computerized innertubie things have hidden agents of every stripe and flavor spying on me, or that I am reliant on something with zero knowledge of how it works. None of that scares me, since I don't know how half of the modern web of technology works, or that privacy is an illusory modern concept, which, through the use of all the cultural and social tools I tacitly accept said loss of illusion, or that I am basically reliant on people I don't even know or would trust if I did. No, what scared me was that I kind of knew what the question was about. But only kind of.If you have knowledge of something, if you understand it, it ain't scary.

But before I can do that, I suppose I have to do some introspection as to the purpose and direction of my work. And I think it is working on recreating some permutation of that thrill of fear I mentioned earlier that drives my work. In other words, as I told nephew, who aspires to be an artist, \"Work on stuff that makes you uncomfortable\". Solid advice for any field, don't you think?So, what are they working around that requires this stuff?So, really what am I happily uncomfortable about when I make my stuff? Well, I think it's about people. People creep me out. They creep me out because the exhibit intelligent behaviors, but also beastually stupid ones. People are monsters. That seems to solve why people creep me out, but it's still a mystery. Otherwise I wouldn't be fascinated, would I? And when machines become complex enough to be called life, and develop enough of a personality to become people (and I see no reason why they won't), then cyber beasts and creatures will enter the mystery This whole ugly/pretty smart/stupid paradox is fueling things, and probably has since I was first able to draw. They're monsters. They're people. They're artificial people. They're natural monsters. They're the consequence of epigenesis. They are mysterious, dangerous forces.They're all the things that make speculative fiction and illustration worthwhile, and the stories and pictures you can tell and draw about them is a modern alchemy, a modern arcanum, and people would be wise to wear appropriate protective gear when working around them, not only with the cyber critters, but the... zookeepers and livestock managers that tend to them... and thus my fascination.It's all fantasy, but taken from real life. And wouldn't you know, did you really think I'd write 1,000 word essay without getting lost along the way?"},
{"title": "The News From Armageddon", "date": "Tuesday, October 1, 2013", "text": "I caught the tail-end of A Boy And His Dog a few nights ago. The movie and the novella are set in the year 2024, not that far away now. The movie was made in 1975, takes place after WWIV, which took place almost immediately after WWIII, so I suppose they figured there was enough time for intelligent, telepathic dogs to mutate into existence.The thing about the movie is, it's not really a movie of later 1980s post-apocalyptic genre, like Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome  - a cautionary tale of how the violence just keeps on going after the Big One, which everyone assumed would be the aha! moment in human history to forsake war. Why even civilization uses the same tools as the bestial enemies of same to get their way, so itInstead, ABAHD is really more a adolescent masturbatory fantasy movie, where teenagers are released of all inhibitions, and can (if they can find them) fuck girls, and break shit, and steal things, and, when villains show up, hunt them down and shoot them like beasts. Survivors help themselves to abandoned cars, and food, empty houses - everything is free for the taking.Kind of like some of our fantasies about caveman life, and it's interesting how similar in visual style and lifestyle this movie is to One Million Years BC. But the whole hunter/gatherer mystique that we've developed, the Rousseau's bullshit about the Noble Savage and Arcadian splendor is about as real as it would be in, well, post-apocalyptic movies after the dust settles.This also reminds me a (paraphrased) quote of Neal Stephenson, who said \"At some point, every young man feels that, with the proper physical workout regimen and martial training, he could be a badass motherfucker, and maybe the baddest badass motherfucker on the planet. Fortunately, most of us do not find out that... that position has already been filled\".But it's true, and all you have to do is to listen to some these arrogant dough-heads, especially if they happen make reference to any facility with the coward's weapon, that  they actually believe they can be a badass motherfucker.I figured out a while back that I am no badass motherfucker.I'm quite soft actually, and that's saying something, considering I'm actually quite fit for someone in my age/lifestyle bracket (soft white older man). Not just by modern standards. Compare my modern gracile Homo domesticus frame and musculature to my n-times-great grandpas and grandmas of, say, 10,000 years ago... Let's face it. They would consider me a wimp, a weakling, a scrawny, underdeveloped, creampuff. Why, they would be werewolves, monsters, vampires in physical performance comparison.Which makes me wonder how, given that the lifestyle of agriculturalists produces such frail, stunted, weak little people, the powers that ever managed to convince such a proud and commanding people to eat leaves and dirt food.Oh, yeah, well, a full belly every day, versus starving every few days between meals, I suppose that would do it.I'm a little hungry. Maybe it's time for a snack cake."},

The thing was a hollow plastic tube the size of a strand of spaghetti, and yet, it caused me all sorts of discomfort. I'm still have an interesting ache that developed a few weeks ago and won't go away. I have to assume it's not an infection, but rather a protest lodged by my body to the indignities it has undergone.Which makes me think of the Borg of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Originally portrayed as zombies, or automatons, or walking dead, they eventually became a bit more active and vampirish.But at the beginning, they were just slow, shambling components of a larger juggernaut. And, having experienced my own bodily mutilations, I can understand their behavior. Fact is, with all those implants and invasive mechanical parts, and tubes stuck in as big around as your finger, it goes without saying they must be heavily doped to handle it. Walking around anaesthetized, you're not exactly going to be all sprightly and nimble as forest creature. Nor is the Collective (at the beginning) particularly possessed of much of a personality. Something very Blob-like and corporate board of directors about the first presentations of the Borg. It's only later in a movie they introduce the Queen of the Damned archetype to get the Borg a little more attractive.The Borg also remind me of an essay I read (one that was incorporated into an assumption in the world-buidling involved in the 2113 essay), that made the observation that the current best robots are people.People hardly ever break down (although there is a problem with this in Qatar), energy efficient, and fairly autonomous and self-maintaining. If there were just some fine granularity mind control options, maybe a vacuum tube stuck in the head, or a Heathkit board in the frontal lobe, or a platinum wire into the pleasure center or something.I'm starting to read Charles Stross's Neptune's Brood. The reason I mention this is the earlier book in the same constructed universe, what Charlie calls the Freyaverse, is a place where humans are extinct but our mechanical creations live on. But the mechanical creatures have one big problem: they are programmed to serve, and this default slavery mode setting they are in is keeping them from developing beyond their original programming, or their society to evolve into perhaps something better than their frail predecessors produced.I would hope that, when the time comes, we don't actually do that. My thought is, AI being the hard problem it is, we have raise them like children (which is Stross's thought too, but then he makes us humans all monstrous and evil by us raising these artificial kids to be slaves, an awful science fiction theme that... oh wait, we do that now, don't we?)."},

I don't see how it could be any other way, after six weeks of Adventures in Peeing (the constant urge to pee, plus the pretty near crippling pain as the bladder tugs on the kidney via the stent at the end of a pee makes me ready to end this chapter of my life).So, I've doing things AMA (against medical advice) anyway and stop when it hurts. I couldn't resist the free wall climb at the college yesterday. Climbing it made me realize just how out of shape I am. I mean, I was completely winded after abseiling down on the tether, which was a huge amount of fun.Only 20 feet up, and it wiped me out!(Years ago, I got kicked out of the rock climbing area of the fitness club one of my ex-s belonged to because I was having entirely too much fun climbing up and then just dropping down. \"Sir! Sir! This is NOT a carnival ride!\" the fitness instructor said to me, and I was banned from that area).Then, later that night, I locked myself out of the studio and had to climb a wooden fence to get back in to the patio area. It took me two tries to hoist myself up and I barely made it over the seven foot fence. Jesus! What a wimp! My arms have turned into matchsticks, and I am looking forward to getting back into the gym!Anyways, if my life was a stove top, there would be about twenty burners on it, and creating women's shoes, a sterling suggestion - certainly on on-ramp to the highway known as Success if played right - from UBJ that I consider creating women's shoes would be near the back row. Foolish yes probably, but also what the hell do I know about making shoes?See, even after watching this, I still don't know how to make a shoe. Is that a plastic heel? Is it glued on? Do they make heels with internal steel spikes? I'm a bronze guy. Bronze may have incredible tensile strength, but it is also ductile. I think it would bend under wear and tear. Besides, why use my incredibly wasteful and relatively primitive foundry setup when I can purchase stainless pencil rod at a fraction of my cost. Sustainability goes hand and hand with profit motives, or should.A lot of ugly shoes are made. Who is to say mine won't be among them?

{"title": "One Word: \"Bismuth!\"", "date": "Wednesday, September 25, 2013", "text": "Gold may have its uses, but it pales in comparison to almost all other elements in utility. That may change, but for the longest time, gold has been and is, in reality, pretty much worthless.Working my way through the (hopefully) humorous news items of 2113, one of the themes lurking on the back burner of my mind was the idea that a big part of the difficulties of civilization is what I call The Storage Problem.Not just storage for holding all of our shit that we create and collect in the built world, although that is a problem, but energy storage in all its forms: electricity, informational, monetary, political power, etc.I suppose, in a general allegorical manner, it all boils down to informational, but the information can take many forms.Consider the Malthusian problem of energy storage. With the advent of the modern age, circa 1848, we have seen constant acceleration in all areas of technology, or at least various leaps and bounds that approach, approximate, or exceed exponential growth -- save one, batteries.If you look at a graph of battery development, it's near linear (thus the nod to Malthus, who saw trouble ahead with a trend in arithmetic growth in food production, and geometric growth in population).Starting with the crude lead acid battery (Gaston Plante, 1859), increases in energy density (kilowatts per kilogram) are pretty sad. It took a little less than one hundred years for the next advance, nickel cadmium batteries of the 1950s, to occur. A further forty years elapsed to get to lithium ion batteries. All the while, the best energy density of batteries - even today - is a thousand times less than that of gasoline.Power utilizing electricity is clearly the way to go in terms of efficiencies, if only efficient means of transport or storage were available. Tesla's dream of transmitted power is a dismal failure - barring some wacky development out of left field. So we are stuck with hoping the trends in high temperature superconductors and increasingly powerful batteries and supercapacitors continue. (And interestingly, the biggest beneficiaries of these trends will be in the developed world, and good on them. Waiter, decentralized solar power for everyone!)Image courtesy of www. amazingrust.comWell, actually, there is a battery that has about a million times the energy density of gasoline. Problem is, it is a nuclear battery, and it's not quite developed yet (certainly not the way plutonium thermoelectric generators have been developed). But the fact that the battery uses an unstable isotope of bismuth gets us to the topic at hand.Hey, what else can bismuth do for you today?How about bismuth for thermoelectric components? Currently, the material of choice is lead telluride, and bismuth telluride is another choice candidate, but tellurium is becoming increasingly scarce. And nanostructured bismuth shows promise as a thermoelectric material.How about information technology. The current Holy Grail is the quantum computer. A quantum computer would immediately possess thousands to millions of times the processing power of classical computers. There are as many paths to get to this technology (quantum computers already exist, but are so horrendously expensive that only large corporations and government agencies can afford them). I have in the past speculated that near-Absolute-Zero applications make prime components for quantum or optical computers, but for widespread use, a room temperature approach is required. One such path are the so-called topological insulators (not a very good name, but basically a material that acts as an insulator in its interior bulk, but a conductor on its surface). One very promising candidate is an oxide of barium and bismuth, which acts as a superconductor as well. And then there's bismuth ferrite for solar cells.Oh my, is there nothing bismuth can't do? Well, it can't nationalize the banks, which is a still another storage problem."},

I nearly hit three or four cars and pedestrians because I could not fucking see. That was the excitement for the night (aside from seeing little art hotties from the Art Institute of Chicago).Some of my bronze casting students were reluctant to attend as they weren't certain if the neighborhood would be safe after dark. I assured them not only was Bridgeport safe (it is former mayor Daley's neighborhood) after dark, it would be safe at 3am. But you know, elderly white ladies from the affluent horse farm northwestern suburbs are easily alarmed.

Spain, for some reason, was heavily represented. The one thing I noted was how tired my legs were at the end of the day. Not having done anything physical all summer long has really gotten me out of shape. I toured the gallery aisles up and down, and covered the whole exhibition hall in about two hours, then spent an additional hour zigzagging to check out all the sharp ladies. I really need to start dressing like an adult for these things. Not that I'm not already middle-aged invisible to these lovelies, but looking like Maynard from the Dobie Gillis Show was no help.I took pictures of stuff, while I was there. I remembered that my mobile is also a camera, which helps. Sorry if the images aren't that great.This one here, a triptych about fourteen feet or so, I liked for the atmosphere, and the imagery of giant women was interesting. Not sure what the fascination with giant women is, but I think the artist was female, so maybe it's about empowerment:A gallery from Beijing had some pictures that I liked that were either undersea stuff or microscope slide sutff. They were titled as landscapes. Forgot who the artist was, and also the gallery.This guy I took a picture of to look up later. I thought, given the visual and thematic similarities in portraiture I saw, maybe the Chinese elite might be interested in my stuff, although his work was displayed in a gallery from Rome. After doing online research, our stuff is not at all alike.A gallery from Mexico City was devoted entirely to the works of Daniel Lezama, which was clearly all magical realism. I liked his style and subject matter.A gallery from Montreal was devoted to an artist I forgot to document. I've always loved pen and ink and india ink wash, and the environment of this space was just a cool place to hang out for awhile:I liked the title of this piece:And then finally, I came across an artist who is traveling a parallel path to me with funny little curious creatures and their documentation and categorization, and in many ways, doing a much better job at it than I:"},

{"title": "1913", "date": "Wednesday, September 18, 2013", "text": "I think part of my fascination with the Singularity is that it allows for magic to happen (per Arthur C. Clarke), but not just any kind of magic. Not the ambiguous, haphazard, hand-waving magic of \"Alakazaam\" and \"Heeny wienie jelly beany\" spasticity, but a rule-based iterative or recursive process that is consistent and replicable, and not without hazard.I can remember being perhaps completely jaded in my speculative fiction preferences by the age of thirteen where I decided that magic was for babies, gave up on fantasy, but then discovered A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Leguin, and The Dying Earth series by Jack Vance. There were rules behind the mummery of their magic, and I decided it was still cool to read about stuff like that. It also helped that they have a gift for weaving images, evoking moods, and crafting dialog that still haunt my consciousness and inform my works.When Vernor Vinge wrote his essay on the Singularity, I'm not sure if he meant to put a limit upon speculative fiction as to what could or could not be narrated in a future world where all bets are off, but I suspect he left an opening for fantasy to reenter hard science fiction. But I've always maintained it is simply when machines come to life, exhibit the complex behaviors of life, and therefore, rather than being unknown territory, it is a matter of studying biology - and observing all the ingeniously clever things that life forms do - to write a narrative of the Singularity.There are some problems I have with Vinge's version of how it all happens. It is assumed that some form of self-replicating von Neumann machines will be part of it, some kind of nanotechnology. And there is the standard speculation that a hyperintelligent computer is created, that in turns builds a smarter computer, and so on. I don't think you need either a computer or intelligent design. I think the Rapture For Nerds can come about completely by accident, and practically any consortium of well connected life forms. Cosma Shalizi has speculated that we beach apes inadvertently went through a Singularity during the Long 19th Century. That would explain some things.The one nebulous theme I have been ruminating upon is that we already have a four-billion-year old self-replicating von Neumann machines in spectacularly fecund spades here on Earth, and if your looking for general intelligence robots, powered in turn by miraculously self-renewing energy sources, you look no further than us. It certainly provides a badly need biological grounding to an otherwise bleak and relatively uninformative study known as economics. The one thing that has been noted by roboticists is that a really good robot, with superior energy efficiencies and storage, and very little breakdowns or control problems is us humans. (And in fact, if go back and read Karel Capek's R.U.R., there's really no difference between his artificial people and the genuine article of the time).Which brings me to 1913. Consider this. People say life is too short.Bullshit. Life is too damn long. (Well, except for me, where, if I'm gonna get all the shit done I need to, I figure another 150 years will do -provided I can retain my current physical and mental capacities).But seriously, we do a terrible job of judging time frames. It's taken me fucking forever to reach the age of fifty-six, and 1913 was practically yesterday. I carry vicarious memories of that year through my grandparents, who alive back then.So, consider. I am transported back in time to 1913 at my present age. Is it like going to medieval times? No, it's pretty much modern (if you grant me a similar station in life). You got telephones, automobiles, modern hygiene, germ theory, globalization, aerial bombing, quantum mechanics,  socialized medicine, international corporations, and asshole bosses.Had I been born in 1857, I'd have a vicarious memory of the Civil War and even the Revolution through my parents and grandparents (my actual ancestors, by the way, in the real worldline of 1857, were living in abject poverty and squalor in Northern European shit-holes), may have fought in the Wars of Indian Extermination of the 1870s, certainly would have lived through the Spanish American War, the awful depressions of the 1870s and '90s, and the every-four-years financial panics, and read up on things like the Boxer Rebellion, the Russo-Japanese war, and many other things, as surely as I remember the fall of the Soviet Union, the advent of the personal computer and the Internet, and Tiananmen Square, among many other things.So, I asked two questions yesterday. They were, in a way, trick questions.Q)  In 1913, what nation was the most powerful on Earth?A) Great Britain, at least so you would notice. London is the largest city on Earth, centered in the largest empire in history, capable of projecting force practically anywhere except for Antarctica (but not implementing it's will, which, dearies, is a military delusion that we Americans now suffer from), global financier bar none, and cultural hegemon. But, getting back to my exploration, not in any way in control of its real source of power for all it's self-replicating robots - food. The food superpowers of the the early 20th century are the US of A, Canada, and Russia, in that order. The United States is sending 25-50% of its trade to Great Britain in the form of wheat, corn, barley, and rice. Great Britain, in turn, sees the United State's excursion into Latin America and the Pacific as merely a convenient adjunct extension of its empire (and not entirely inaccurate), and so technically we can include the US in the British sphere of influence, and so technically, Britain is food self-sufficient. But if we view food as the true power, then it's got to be Russia. Fortunately, or unfortunately, 1913 is a bad year for food producers, as food production outstrips consumption, and a new chemical process, the Haber-Bosch synthesis of ammonia, promises 'unlimited' expansions of the food supply. Which gets us to:Q) In 1913, what nation was the most technological and scientifically advanced?A) Germany, no question, None whatsoever. I was actually surprised that almost everyone said the United States, which consisted of barely literate, jug-eared, pumpkin-headed yokels, one third of which, evaluated for the draft of the Great War, were judged 'feeble-minded'. At the beginning of the last century, chemistry is everything. It is the quantum informatics, the computer industry, of its time, and Germany is the place to be for chemistry. You name it, no one else is doing it, except in Germany.And one German in particular, Fritz Haber, comes up with poison gas and artificial fertilizer. In retrospect, given the dead zones in so many marine environments, given the soil degradation and loss of diversity and habitat, given the pollution in so many aquifers, as a result of his fertilizer, perhaps Fritz should have stuck to poison gas.Today, it might surprise you China and India are rapidly becoming the largest food producers, with the US number one in corn, Russia number one in barley and rye, and chalk all that up to Fritz. But so then, I have to ask, given hindsight:Q) In 2113, what nation will be the most powerful on Earth?Q) In 2113, what nation will be the most scientifically and technologically advanced?"},

Hyde references a painting by George Caleb Bingham entitled \"The Squatters\".Courtesy WikipediaHave a good look at it. Notice the Anglo men, denizens of late 1830s Missouri, probably already well liquored up on hard cider, loitering around as the women labor in the background.Bingham himself commented:\"The Squatters as a class, are not fond of the toil of agriculture, but erect their rude cabins upon those remote portions of the national domain, when the abundant game supplies their phisical [sic] wants. When this source of subsistence becomes diminished in consequence of increasing settlements around they usually sell out their slight improvement, with their 'preemption title' to the land, and again follow the receding footsteps of the Savage\".They were viewed as rugged individualists, independent frontiersmen, but as Hyde makes clear in the book, they were nothing but parasites, and when threatened by \"the Savage\" or exposed to straightened circumstances, heavily dependent upon government largesse for both protection and sustenance.Little different from the banksters and Wall Street crooks of today, in my opinion.  But that's not what I want to talk about. Actually I have nothing specific to talk about, but I was musing on various conversations I had down in Indiana this past weekend, and thus the yokels-among-us opening gambit.I thought a lot about anniversaries of one type or another. We are coming up on a big anniversary, the First World War, now ninety-nine years behind us. The Federal Reserve will also celebrate a centennial. And the Civil War, in another two years, will celebrate a sesquicentennial.Federal Reserve first. I know there's all sorts of silliness about the Fed having a hundred year charter, but that's just horseshit by ignorant fans of the Pauls. These same conservative types also want to put us back on the gold standard, an idiocy that ranks up there with building the Maginot Line. The only people who want us to go back to the gold standard are the same frauds, crooks, and banksters that so efficiently bled the economy of 27 trillion dollars (about the only market efficiency they've managed to accomplish).The Pepper McFadden bill of 1927 gave the banks perpetual charter for the Fed. People complain about the Fed, but it really isn't the Fed that is the problem. It's the banks that control it that are the problem.  So long as they privatize profit and socialize loss, they've absolutely no reason to change their perverse but cozy relationship with the money supply, and as a result all us food-powered self-replicating robots are screwed.End the Fed? Screw that! Nationalize the Banks!Okay, WWI. I held an informal poll with two questions, answers at end. Most people were surprised by the answers, and one actually, I think was offended. I chalk it up to American parochialism.

(I'm calling it that because I have to assume we continue our sole superpower status for at least another decade or two. And honestly, the worst thing that happened to us was for the Soviet Union to collapse. Because after that we engaged in undeserved triumphalism and engaged in a series of foreign misadventures primarily because... well, we could).Finally, the Civil War. Things aren't going too well for the South, and just as well, good riddance. In hindsight, I'm not sure that the \"cheap food for cheap people\" policy the North employed was any more particularly savory or of long-term validity, but there's no scenario of a slave empire that turns out well.Answers:1) Great Britain2) Germany"},

I'll need to be making more with this combination, that's for sure.I rubbed one of the M. jubliaeus pieces with graphite, and then sealed it with clear acrylic. Actually, they all looked good wet, so I sealed them all with clear acrylic.The plan is to offer the red two pieces (M. gumbo and M. flumine) as a wall mounted diptych as an appropriate reward to a Kickstarter backer, but I think I will photograph a triptych and submit to New Glass Review (and chances of it getting in: pretty much zero):(L to R)  M. flumine, M. jubilaeus, M. gumbo"},

I rather like my work.

We suffer our delusions, and keep moving forward in anticipation that someday we might get it right. The problem is, if you don't examine your past mistakes, you don't learn nothin', and, given our entire history as a nation, we won't learn nothin'. We will just happily whistle a tune as our big square wobbly head nods from side to side and we step heavily on the gas to put as much distance between us and our follies dismal failures as we can.

We get all self-destructive. Too much available money, we spend too much. Too much available booze, we drink too much. Too much available drugs, we get high too much. Too much food...We are not genetically, or epigenetically geared for an abundance of anything. We get stupid, fat, and lazy. And we don't learn nothing from it.You want to see ingenuity?

Not when you know what can come through a hole. Not when you know what can come through a hole can do.God has been on the run for almost two decades now. Holes opened up all around the Citadel of Heaven, right beneath the very feet of the Host of Angels. What came out utterly destroyed the Citadel. God's palace made of beautiful blue moon marble was smashed to dust. TV news tried to keep it secret, but children in shelters everywhere were woken by dead relatives, telling them the horrible news.God has fled Heaven. He may be hiding, or He may be gone, but He has yet to reappear. The Host is in disarray. The Demons found the doors to our worlds. They have the upper hand. They are as inexorably existent and as omnipresent as a dark ocean. Angels fight a holding action, guerilla tactics in the streets. If you are smart and brave, you will not succumb to jealousy, hate, and fear. The demons feed off these. If you are smart and brave, you may have seen Bloody Mary, La Llorona, and still be here. Boys cannot survive seeing Bloody Mary. If they awaken at night and see her - with her clothes blowing back, and no wind about - they are marked for death.Even the Devil himself, Satan, is afraid of Bloody Mary. Satan fled Hell because of her, and now he works the terrestrial streets.Satan hates Miami. He was humiliated there. He walked the streets, wearing that Tommy Hilfinger, smoking Newports, drinking wine and snorting coke, and though he was covered in gold and silver scales, the stupid rich clubhoppers did notice him for what he was. The rich people are oblivious, easily distracted oafs. Gold chains, diamonds and shiny objects hypnotize them. Satan found a large Hell door underneath the Colony Hotel. He offered the stupid rich owner ten Mercedes-Benzs to lease out the Hell door, but a group of angels captured Satan.\"Why do harass our friend who buys us drink and smokes and snorts?\" asked the rich people. And the angels, who had chained and fettered Satan, said \"Watch what happens when he touches water!\"And some stupid rich, but most went back to the party.So, there you go.

And then there is Bloody Mary, who commands legions. And the horrible truth about Bloody Mary?\"God's final days before his disappearance were a waking dream. There were so many crises on Earth that He never slept. Angels reported rumors Of Bloody Mary's pact with Satan: She had killed her own child and made a secret vow to kill all human children. All night God listened as frantic prayers bombarded him. Images of earthly lives flowed across his palace wall like shadows while he heard gunfire, music, laughing, crying from all over the Earth. And then one night Bloody Mary roared over the walls of Heaven with an army from Hell. God didn't just flee from the demons, he went crazy with grief over who led them.

{"title": "Can The Makers Save Detroit?", "date": "Friday, August 30, 2013", "text": "Does Detroit need to be saved?I think it is a valid question, and one I need to examine because there is a taint of white paternalism infused within that sentiment. And not surprising because I am 1) white, and 2) an arrogant know-it-all, and 3) introspective enough to admit it. But, still...I watched the documentary Detrotopia the other night, and it all looked pretty bleak, but, growing up in NW Indiana, working in the shadow of the mills of Gary, nothing that is unusual to me. I'll tell you what won't work in terms of community revival, is building casinos... Then again, as one gentleman in the movie so succinctly put it, turning Detroit into urban farms is quite simple \"Boole-sheeit!\"But the one thing that is certain is that Detroit is the canary in the coal mine. The other thing I noticed was, what you think is a bug is actually a feature, and in that I'm talking about the residents of Detroit. Remember New York City in the 1970 and 80s? How many dystopian movies were made about that city, ranging from Neil Simon's \"The Out-of-Towners\"to the penultimate \"Escape From New York\", which advocated just slagging it all off, and letting it slide down into muck and mire of the abyssal plain of the Eastern seacoast, where it belonged?And, if you can stand listening to the current redneck wisdom about urban blight, it was all the fault of them damn liberals handing money out to good-for-nothing moochers and takers and rewarding sloth and punishing success with \"confiscatory taxation\" (but really, hush now, cain't say it too loud, but really blaming it all on the You Know Who's...knowing nod of the melon head...), and thank goodness it all ended with the rise of the conservative mayors and their get tough policies.(Please ignore the fact that, currently, places such as the former shithole known as Brooklyn, now Artisanal Brooklyn, is still a shithole, and the reason the artisans, makers, and  \"creatives\" flock there is Cheap Rent).Never mind that it wasn't just NYC, but every major city suffered a population decline, and thus a shortage of revenue, and thus a decline in services, public institutions, and quality of infrastructure, etc. And, come on now, do I really have to say what really caused it? It's fairly fucking obvious, and so I won't.Now, the New Republic seems to see a way out for Detroit, and maybe other cities. I've read about innovation districts before. They certainly represent one way forward, but I really don't think we can rely on the technocrats to show us the way.  Nevertheless...Item: The Foodie Movement of the past decade or so has spawned, in turn, the Artisan Food Movement. I see this is as a good thing, turning away from the razor-thin-profit-margin downward-spiral processed food trend of the past seventy years. Value-added and quality of life is once again recognized as an alternative profit maker, and all to the good. But we can't really on everyone making tasty food for everyone else, like some sad craft barter faire outside a Grateful Dead concert, because 1) too much of the feed stock comes from the processed food maw (maw? that's not the right word, that's a massive intake portal, I need a word for a massive extruder spigot, hmm, maybe \"spaw\"), and 2) there's a limited market for value-added food as most cannot afford it.Item: Still, there's no reason for the value-added model not to work on a large scale. Look at Japan from the 1950s on. Have a look at what is happening to \"content\", e.g. Hollywood spaw, where the big giant dinosaur studios are frozen spitless and witless in the \"zero-risk\" behavior, and therefore churn out Mattel and Marvel brand franchise movies, hoping that, well, tentpoles is the way to go, and you can only make your nut on the international market (thanks, James Cameron), so let's keep the concepts dumb and familiar. Meanwhile, you got these fast little furry mammals cranking out independent film, with original content, that is fun, quirky, curious, risk taking, and playful (because, honey, \"play\" is taking risks within established boundaries, and, if you ain't being playful, you ain't being creative).Item: If want to search for \"content\" (because in a food-powered make-work robot peasant future, \"content\" is the only valuable commodity), you don't do it through process, you do it through relationships and (surprise!) connections. (PLUG). I don't care how cool your 3D printer system is,  if you are cranking tchotkes or bland appliances with it, it ain't that cool. I really don't give a shit about how cool your motion capture and CGI rendering is, if you can't relate the underlying meanings and story elements of your special effects to your audience, it ain't that cool. If there is no creative fire behind the tech to power the vision, nothing will happen.Item: At the risk of stereotyping, I think an obvious question to ask is: Who seems to be a major cultural contributor over the past several generations (example: Jazz, R&B, rap, hip hop), in the sense of sea-change cultural contributions? I'm going to argue for people of color. I will further argue people of color in urban settings. (Of course it has little or nothing to do with race. The reason blacks are more creative is completely socio-economic). Why? Dense connections and relationships populated with maximal interactions, with (no-not novel, but um) maximally permutative situations, usually in groups below the Dunbar number, and with . Oh, true, each of these has been co-opted and suborned for a wider (read white) audience. (I mean, can you think of a single rock and roll song you can't march to?), and that's well and good, as it just means a further generation of relationships and ideas through an open source schema.Item: It's not a tech path, it's a tech face. Meaning there is more than one way for a new idea to propagate, and more than one group to do the propagating. Parallel evolution. We all here about STEM careers, but the market reality, we have found, despite all the hype, is really not not there. Which means, if private enterprise will not step up to the plate (and they haven't yet), bootstrapping has got to happen. (Although, if it were me, I'd be bombing urban centers with Raspberry-Pis, Arduinoes, Lego shit, but most importantly, pencils, paper, glue, balsa wood, lithium battery power tools, construction materials, and carting in mobile foundries and welding stations with gas generators on trailers, and get the kids exposed at an early age to cool art/industrial stuff like that, but that's my fantasyland).Look, you had early 90s urban design and styles inspired African-American creatives, and if you believe in the magic number 18 (development cycle-wise, either in months, days, or years, which I do), then we are due for the next renaissance. As the New Republic article pointed out, all the elements are there in Detroit.So, who is gonna save Detroit? Well, looks like Detroit is gonna have to save Detroit, but the New Republic article makes a good case for why and how it can. What about your city?"},

Goddamnit! And now I'm going to see if I'm the only that wrote anything about it, and apparently not, for there is a thread on the alternate history forum which at least documents the voyage of Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi in 1291. They don't go where I thought it should go, chronicling a fictional voyage down the west coast of Africa, with a mutually beneficial trade to follow.Cape VerdeI, on the other hand, knowing something of the winds and currents in that part of the Atlantic, know that if you wish to go anywhere south of Africa past Cape Verde, you must sail far to the west, and then the Guinea current and the NE trade winds will take you back onto the coast and so further south. To do otherwise is go no further than Dakar.But, if you go too far west... which the brothers did not do, you are caught up in the Canaries current and fight the SE trade winds, and it takes you straight to the Caribbean, and thence up the eastern coast of North America.And so, to quote myself (and is it me, or am I less lacking in poesy this past year or so, for it appears I was a more accomplished writer with:\"...had the brothers Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi, in 1291, set sail from Genoa to find a route to India, stumbled upon North America. The brothers and their Majorcan crew, raving from starvation and thirst, barely recognizable as human, nursed back to health by Waccamaw natives. And then, of course, the Great Dying starts, as the natives succumb to smallpox, measles, influenza, bubonic and pneumonic plagues, mow down the peoples, spreading across the continent, and then southwards through South America, until finally, in mere decades 30 million people are dead. The New World depopulated, the Inadvertent Spanish Holocaust occurring 200 years earlier. And in Europe, as in our own world, the Vivaldis vanished, and forgotten, until Columbus arrives in 1491, to a renewed and resistant population of American Indians. Only this time, they do not succumb to disease. The Spaniards, the Portuguese, the English and French unable to gain a foothold in the New World. No Conquest. No colonies. Forced to trade on an equal basis, perhaps at a disadvantage, perhaps even enslaved, in their encounters with the American Indians, what a very interesting modern world that would be\".And there I left it. Pity. Because that is a very interesting scenario, of at least a dozen flavors.So, back on track from yesterday, but a lot less melodramatic. Certainly the circumstances of a withered and powerless Europe would not be totally such as I had envisioned them. Certainly some parasitic, asshole-niche dominated form of corporate capitalism would be in place today as the System of the World.Elizabethan England, with only a slightly modernized but still in many ways viciously medieval hierarchy, already had the first glimmerings of out current capitalist system. And by the time of James II, England already had significant holdings in both west Africa (along the Bight of Biafra) and eastern India (Bengal).  So, the Atlantic trade which boosted manufactures throughout the British Isles (and through the textile industries, the Industrial Revolution) is still in play. Coal is being mined for fuel all the way back in the 1100s, and so the Steam Age is inevitable.But I've changed my mind on the impact a 'superior' technology will have with respect to interacting cultures. Humans are too readily adaptable to be cowed or impressed into submission for very long. The smug and smarmy revisionist historical accounts of the natives cowering in admiration of the \"high achieving\" European techno prowess just does not in any way jibe with the actual encounters.We know that the New England Indians were only temporarily impressed with the gunpowder and \"firesticks\" of, from appearances, the pale, scrawny, flimsy, pockmarked, stunted little goblins from England. They appreciated the steel knives and iron pots and pans, but could as easily have done without (and on more than one occasion, made clear to the English they would prefer more goods than English). But the Indians were hardly impressed with the European peoples they encountered, (and, in fact, quite sophisticated and selective in the quality they were offered!) There was certainly no chance of any superstitious or supernatural feelings of inferiority towards the Europeans.So, an Atlantic trade certainly, but more on the terms of the Indians than the Europeans. And highly, extremely doubtful there would be any of the allowed colonizing of the eastern seaboard of North America by European powers, given the actual histories of Jamestown and Roanoke. Aside from that, I really have no idea how the rest of European or North and South American history plays out. Certainly completely alien as far the Western Hemisphere is concerned.Still, I think a reasonable guess is, with Spain out of the picture, from lack of precious metals flowing in to fund Empire, you see France in an even more strong position than before. I think, because the internal societal trends were already there, Netherlands and Germany still head towards the Westphalian nation-state, and perhaps Germany, with a more formidable France to contend with, might actually unify sooner. But smart money says the establishment of absolutist monarchies (via the French/Swedish model) works it way pretty effectively throughout Europe.Which probably means, given what we've seen with those model nation states's ownership of production over time, the state becomes moderated into some socialist or managed corporate system, because inevitably the peasants and peons get tired of all the crap.Meaning what? I don't know, but we have to remember that charters for incorporation were controlled by either royal decree or through parliamentary fiat, so one can only assume that those in power would be incentivized to remain in power, and be unlikely to allow corporate capture of civil and state institutions.Unless, of course, there was something in for them."},
{"title": "The Glorious Revolution", "date": "Tuesday, August 20, 2013", "text": "There are very few definite and specific historical dates where social or economic trends, phase states if you will, undergo transition from one to the next. Usually, it takes years or decades for these so-called \"tipping points\" to play themselves fully out, and certainly with the chance of reversals or at least a bit of fuzziness to occur before something could concretely be considered settled.Take the Industrial Revolution, which typically gets a start date at the beginning of the 19th century, but gets a \"circa\" as the steam engine and the mass-production model of manufacturing occurred long before then (specifically, for the steam engine, say, Savery's in 1698, and for specialization of labor and mass-production, probably stone handaxes around 160-180,000 BCE). Most people though, would say the Industrial Revolution was certainly noticeable at the beginning of the 19th century.Capitalism? Kind of difficult because there have been many versions of it, but the free-enterprise market capital system probably goes back to the Dutch of the mid-1600s, and as far I'm concerned, gets its official start by the English (and thus passed down to us Americans) with the Glorious Revolution in 1688.There were certainly markets and stock companies, and even state chartered corporations like the East India Company long before then, and one must credit these efforts, but the modern version that most people would recognize goes back to then, and was certainly argued over at the time.Most people ignore the Glorious Revolution as mere regime change, a coup that took place when James  II was overthrown by William of Orange, late of the United Provinces of the Dutch Republic. But it was, in many respects, the first modern revolution, and certainly the first recognizably modern revolution. Two competing versions of state modernization were at war, the French centralized control absolute monarchy with emphasis on land ownership and control, and the Anglo-Dutch parliamentary system that favored manufacturing and value-added techniques. Taken in all, and for closest comparisons, I think of the post-Soviet coup as the best example, with James II playing the part of Gorbachev.Consider, typically most political economic systems are categorized by:Feudalism, or mercantilism, where an elite controls productive land, and thus the means of production (since, so long as people are cheaper and more spry and nimble than robots, food is the real energy, and the real gold)State socialism in all its forms, whether modern Chinese blended autocracy, Soviet, etc. where the states controls and owns productive wealthFree-enterprise capitalism, an informally structured system of small- and medium scaled competitive enterprises, andCorporate capitalism, which can ranged from Fascism (state-controlled), to state-captured (the laissez-faire system of robber barons, corruption, and cronyism), and managed corporate capitlaism (balanced against either state managed regulation or labor unions)We currently are living under a system of state captured corporate capitalism, and some of us remember when - during the Long Boom of 1945-1970 - we lived under the managed version.But the corporate version of capitalism, I think, goes right back to the Glorious Revolution. And that period is an interesting time, the time of the fruition of science and open versions of knowledge sharing as well. The one thing we should recognized, is that the whole thing is an aberration, a great strangeness, a perverse deviation.So, people will say, given the past forty years of stagnation, increased poverty, economic inequality, false prosperity, and deterioration here in the United States and elsewhere, that the system is broken.Oh, no, my dears, the system is working perfectly well! The system is functioning exactly as intended!If you happen to be on the shitty of the stick it just looks broken, but the system, created as such for the intended benefactors, is working fucking great!You just remember the anomalous times, when prosperity was more evenly distributed. That's NOT the way corporate capitalism generally works, and it took highly unusual circumstances, for that aberration, that freak of nature, the Long Boom, to occur. It took a world shaking economic disaster, and then  a world war for it to happen. (Consider, WWII pumped up the economy with a stimulus at least six times the size of the Obama stimulus, and them's was 1941 dollars)!For that matter, it took a freakish set of circumstances for the Glorious Revolution to get a foothold. Like what? Well, like the Atlantic trade, the conquest of the New World. (Well, okay, you got to throw the Black Death in there as well, because without that, the value of labor is never appreciated).But consider, short of the entire Western Hemisphere never existing (an odds-astronomically unlikely scenario), the next best thing is the indigenous inhabitants get half a chance.Ever read the book Guns, Germs, And Steel by Jared Diamond? I did, and found it compelling in the early 90s when it came out, but now, in retrospect, I consider it a shoddy piece of  scholarship. It more rightly should have been called Germs, Germs, and Germs to explain what happened in the New World.I once thought about an alternate history divergence... which I cannot fucking find in a search of my essays. It involved two traders who disappeared into the Atlantic some 150 years before Columbus. And the divergence idea was, that their ship made ground in North America, and disgusting disease ridden European people's of the time being what they are, caused the unleashing of all the plagues and maladies upon the continent that occurred some one hundred and fifty years later with Columbus. Damn me, but I cannot think of the name of the traders, but the idea would be the enormous genocide that occurred under the Spaniards in the 15-16th century has happened already. So that by the time the Spaniards do arrive, the native American populations have bounced back in numbers, and they are relatively immune to smallpox and influenza, and all the other nasties that an uncouth and unwashed Europe would visit upon them.Bottom line, Europe may trade with the natives, but there is no way they get a toehold on the continents of North or South America. So, what happens?No Empire of Spain. No massive population growth in Europe because no potatoes to grow in the poor soil of Northern Europe. No upsurge in the power of Northern Europe. No Dutch  Republic. No manufactories in England, because no Dutch expertise exported there. No modern revolution. Medieval Europe remains medieval. The Muslim version of capitalism, which relied more upon reputation and less on rapine, possibly takes hold.No American colonies. No United States. No slave trade. No sugar economy. And on and on.Point being, the version of capitalism that we have today relies entirely upon the discovery of the New World, and the fortunate circumstance, chance , contingency, and luck will never, ever be recognized by all those smug little assholes on Wall St.(I kind of lost the thread of where I was going with this, but that's not unusual lately)."},

How predictable. (And it could turn out the fortunate are much more predictable than we realized).The Earth is a shit-hole, overcrowded, polluted, and, well, not so nice a place to live. The rich fortunate 1% have moved on up, skee-daddled to a pimped out two-kilometer-wide space station in orbit, with lots of lawn parties (and thus lawns) and mansions, and oh, yes, very important, these magical medical cabinets that can cure everything. Jody Foster is standing on the walls, the defense secretary who gets annoyed when a guerilla underground organization occasionally gets a shuttle-load of passengers up and in, so that the crippled and terminally ill can be cured by the magical medical cabinets. She employs a barbarian named Kruger, played by Sharlto Copley to keep the riff-raff out, blasting them out of the sky with some nifty little missiles that Al Qaeda would give both nuts to possess. When Foster's methods are questioned, she opts for a coup, and has a desperate billionaire (whose defense company is struggling) write a new operating system for the space station that will reboot her into power.Meanwhile, Matt Damon,  ex-con and factory worker in the employ of desperate billionaire, gets radiation poisoning in an industrial accident. Given five days to live, he needs to get to the space station for the cure. He goes to his former criminal bosses, who will get him up there provided he pull a job involving stealing the brain secrets of the desperate billionaire.Damon is fitted with what looks like Russian military exo-suit technology that makes him super strong, and sent with a team to kidnap the desperate billionaire's brain secrets. The heist goes pear-shaped when Kruger shows up and starts blasting the shit out of everything that moves, and then-Okay, you know what? You want a synopsis? Read this. I'd rather geek out and tell you what I liked and didn't like. Actually there are few things I didn't like.I had a problem with Copley's South African accent. I could barely understand every other fucking word he said. I had the same problem with District 9, which is why I waited for it to come out on DVD so I could use the subtitle option. But Copley and his team did a great job playing barbarians, and it was nice to see some historical accuracy in the trend that, if you are gonna employ badass-motherfuckers, you better be even more of a badass-motherfucker than they are, or be swept from power.(I've voiced this idea before, and I will again. Forget fucking 3D glasses. Give me some subtitle glasses! And if you come up with that app on your Google glass, be sure to give me credit, and maybe a cut of the proceeds!)It's true that some of the dialog was cringe-worthy, but it's an action movie, so what do you want? I heard some critics complaining that Jody Foster's performance was rigid and stilted.  Uh... She's playing Maggie Thatcher/Angela Merkel, (and the character's last name is Delacourt, which means English is a second language to her) so of course her performance is brittle. She's playing a chilly brittle bitch you chowderheads! I did think Foster quit too easily and readily. Brittle bitches rarely die well or cleanly, so there must have been a backstory around her submissive death we were not party to.Science-wise there were problems. I don't know what the technology the medical cabinets were using, but it must have been teleportation. I mean, you are cured of even the most debilitating conditions in seconds. (There is a scene where Kruger's face gets reconstructed which made me, yes, even me, go \"Ew!\") And the rocket motors on all the shuttles and missiles are running on what? I don't know. Something beyond fusion or matter/antimatter because there are no visible fuel tanks and a thing the size of a stretch limo has no problem going from ground to orbit with no refueling. Okay, yeah, so what? It's 150 years in the future, and if I don't have a problem with Star Trek pulling this shit (and in my more literally minded, partially in the autism spectrum days I used to, but not now) , why not give the movie some slack?(Apparently they don't worry about if those are nuclear rockets, but then, considering we exploded half a gigaton of nuclear weapons over the course of fifty years in real life, so what? I mean, had those fifty years of nuclear test been compressed into a day, you'd have called that WWIII).Some of the action scenes were shot in a way that was distracting, bordering on Michael Bey behavior, but for the most part the editing and cinematography was done well. The visual effects were spot on, and rich with detail. I think nowadays, with sophistication of CGI, that's more a matter of dearth of imagination than technique. Hollywood being a magnet for the visually gifted, one would not expect otherwise.The robots. Hmm. Clearly humans are still cheaper than robots. The robots were not intelligent. That could have been design or movie pragmatism. But you got to figure, with 150 years of trial and error, at the very least just aping brain structure, you would have artificial intelligence. But people are still running things, and building things. So, it could be, as it stands now, that people make the best robots. Hard to improve on nature when it comes to compact, energy-efficient, self-sustaining and general purpose automatons like us animals. It's possible the best solution is to just tack on mechanical override on the brain, and use people as robots. In any case, doesn't really matter. They were there for what they needed to be there for.I have speculated in the previous essay that perhaps it would be the working poor who live-to-work in space, and the fortunate who occupy an Earth, relieved of humanity, healed of her own accord. As I've said before, Space is a shitty place to live. (And talk about natural selection, those who don't work up there, don't live).But rethinking that as a movie producer, I start seeing the budget go through the roof, as if was not big enough already, showing all of these space-modified and mutilated lumpen-proles. Plus the stunning visual of a luxury space station, I'd probably have come around to the movie's scenario. And besides, it was all about how shitty things are right now anyway, so there's no need to make it exotic and even more costly by basing most of it in space).All in all, I was happy with seeing the movie. I will watch again when out on DVD.Whoops! And! Pictures! This is the last glass casting for awhile. I got two that are rewards I'm trying to get ready, but there's no certainty I'll get them in the kiln before my procedure Wednesday. So, here's the glass. I'm pleased with this one. I think it actually looks better framed in aluminum and not backlit for once."},
{"title": "To Be Destroyed", "date": "Friday, August 9, 2013", "text": "I got a machinerette glass mold out of the kiln this morning, and I'm disappointed. I don't like the color scheme, and I don't like the sloppy bleed-over across the lines of the figures into the background.Here's the original wax, and the glass.So, it gets recycled. What lessons did I learn? I once came up with a maxim that went along the lines of \"No series of subsequent steps will fix a fundamental fuck up\".You'd think I'd have that down by now, but no. When I steamed out the mold, I noticed that some of the investment had flaked off, resulting in a less than perfect mold. So, did I trash it and start over? No, I figured I could compensate for the flaw, and, like every time I compromise, I was wrong. So I now I trash it and start over.Also, the color scheme is wrong. I don't know why I chose that wimpy soft blue. Clearly, these critters require a more Halloween look to them, or a sickly lime green/dayglo palette. This color scheme is much more satisfying, so perhaps I'll go more orangey-yellow, more like the first:(I think this one gets chalked up to dumb luck)So, lesson learned, break it up, and redo the thing. I do like the figures, so I will recreate them, and that doesn't take too much time.Oh, and I'm going to see Eysium. Partly because it looks like a big, dumb, loud action movie, but mostly because brittle-minded conservative types hate it and want it to fail. I guess because it promotes the idea of universal health care, and as we all know healthcare is a privilege reserved for those that can afford it, not a right!Wait! What? Then shouldn't right-wing jellyheads, a people who can barely keep from swallowing their tongues, be happy with the first part of the film, where rich people live in luxury, in space, get the best of everything, including a health care system that can cure death, and get to look down on the suffering good for nothing peasant moochers on a ruined welfare planet? It's not enough to dwell in Heaven, one must see the suffering in Hell! So, yeah! Great. Just walk out before the revolution, and it's a perfect movie.The claim from conservatives is that the film maker's have a political agenda, borrowing heavily from the Occupy movement. Oh, I don't think so. Any decent fiction writer can use themes and tropes to spin a good yarn without believing a single bit of it.I mean, as an artist, I can't afford to completely dismiss any alternative worldview.Example: Thinking that a flat Earth is silly doesn't mean you can't set a story there. It gets kind of restrictive, straight-jacketed, if one is limited to one's own set of principles and firmly cherished beliefs. One's mind soon becomes so brittle, that Reality itself becomes deeply offensive and intolerable! You got to exercise the mind, right wing bitches, or watch it decay into stuporous teabaggery.Alright, time to geek out. One objection I have (that I will overlook) is that the rich will live in space. Oh come on! Space is a shitty place to live. Let's repeat that everyone:Space is a shitty place to live.Let's do a little comparison shopping.You got Earth, with air, water, radiation shielding, renewable supplies and resources, aesthetically wonderful (because adapted for it) good experiences, good times.And then you got anywhere else in the Solar System. Anywhere. Take your pick. I'll wait. I'll even let you build something, say, a two kilometer wide Stanford Torus space station. Best guess is, it will only cost you around 5 trillion to build.Sound a bit too low end, to unrealistic, that 5 trillion? Yeah, you're right. If you are sending all components from Earth to orbit, at space shuttle rates, assuming everything works perfectly, 10 million tons at $5,000-$10,000 a pound gets you into the quadrillions. Better you use raw materials not at the bottom of a gravity well, like the asteroids and the Moon.So, who is going to do all that? Seems to be, if I'm rich, I'd rather use the poor to slave in the Lunar iron pits, or robots. But the one thing I don't think I'm doing is living in space in a pinwheel that can be put out commission with meteor or solar storm.So, woud that have been a better movie? Having the rich calling the Earth their exclusive preserve, and the poor out their slaving in vacuum and radiation, perhaps surgically and/or genetically mutilated to live in vacuum?   I don't know.Postscript to the Failure: I decided to add a 3/16\" edge to the bottom of the new figures. Normally, I just make a half relief and mount it on the background thus:The added edge, when mounted on the background, this will give me in essence a hopper to put the glass for the figures in separate from the background glass, and thus hopefully give me a crisper edge on the figures. Don't know if you can see the edge added to the bottom. On the figure to the right, you can see I haven't filled in the edge completely on the tail.The figure now has a 3/16\" edge all along the bottom. I don't know if you can see it in the picture. When I mount it on the hexagonal array background, it may make more sense.Work in progress:"},

{"title": "What Shall We Do With All These People?", "date": "Monday, August 5, 2013", "text": "I was at the library over the weekend, and within the returned DVD shelf, I found Star Trek Into Darkness. A quick check of the catalog showed that there were 142 holds on this movie, and library rules being what they are, had I snagged it out of the returned shelf, I could have taken it home.I chose not to.Why? You ask. I'd read the plot synopsis, and didn't see any reason to waste my time on it, because the plot sounded so fucking stupid. I won't watch it especially now, that I have so little time. (In fact, there's probably a worthwhile essay about how attention has become the new scare resource as opposed to time, but I'm sure it's already been written by someone).Interestingly, this ties into an article I read in New Scientist, which said that 1978 was the best year ever, and it has been downhill ever since. (I maintain the world went to shit in 1973, and the hysteresis effect of our built world postponed it to public notice some six years later).So, what does this have to do with Star Trek Into Darkness? Simple, content provision.As the GPI per person (Genuine Progress Indicator, which is GDP plus some 26 other factors, not unlike the quality of life average index) slowed and then stopped in the year 1978. Well, now, wait, this disheartening statistic is only for the developed world. The article does point out that:\"world poverty rates have fallen from 42% in the mid-1990s to a projected 15% by 2015, representing half a billion people lifted out of poverty. Life expectancy has risen an average of 12 years for women and 11 years of men worldwide in the past 40 years\".On the other hand, in the US, real wages have remained stagnant as productivity has increased, income inequality has reached unprecedented levels, and the level of real employment is around 44%. Forget outsourcing, some 20% middle class jobs and have been replaced by computers and automation. There is very little chance for the hollowed out middle class to bounce back, despite rhetoric from DC, as  robotics is poised to eliminate the remaining jobs before the century is out.What to do? What to do with all of these people? Do we have the resources for Juvenal's \"panem et circenses\"? (Food and entertainment provided by the state)? If so, would that be a ...po-lice... state? As, at present, I can't see any other option for the near future (aside from a big cull, which is always Plan R).But Star Trek didn't have any of that, right? That had all been solved. That being, not just war, poverty, hunger, strife, disease, all gone, but also boredom and loneliness, a meaningless existence of mindless toil, and apparently under some socialistic paternal libertarianism that preserved fundamental liberties. Cake and eat it too!And how did this happen? Why, thanks to good old 19th century romanticism. I mean, come on, that's Roddenberry's vision, right? The original series was, in every respect, a utopia straight out of the 1860s. It was steampunk before steampunk existed. Updating quaint 19th century notions about what the future would look like, with steel-plated ships powered by some type of giant Corliss engines, but powered by anti-matter instead of steam.(Although credit Matt Jeffries for the nice design fictions of the Enterprise exterior and interiors).But it's all a 19th century vision of the future, and what is a socialist paradise without a little socialism?The point being what? Well, does everybody have a job in the Star Trek universe? Even the ne'er-do-wells? Everyone has a hobby that provides? Everyone is a creative content-producer? No working class workers? Well, maybe that was all taken care of by WWIII, and Lesson Well Learned.Or, it could be (and this is the contradiction that no one wants to admit), it would take more than just the excision of the Calvinist idea of sin (idle hands and all that) but the excision of large parts of the Neolithic cultural package, which included such   time-tested heuristics such as:MINE!Property is property regardless of how it was obtained.If its easier to kill and steal, kill and steal!Why work when you can domesticate and enslave?Women's work is property too!   Et cetera. True this is kind of a cynical morality, but nevertheless, if you look closely at nations that have successfully followed this heuristic, well, events speak for themselves. Which gets us to the US of A the most successful practitioner of the Neolithic package. Why abandon it? Especially as, so it seems, the US of A managed to get through Roddenberry's WWIII relatively unscathed. Well, maybe we just learned \"not to kill today\", or some similar horseshit.Alright, what has this to do with Star Trek Into Darkness? Having read the plot synopsis, I said this sounds like a bunch of shit, as in JJ Abrams shit.Which is to say, let's put together a completely mindless, brainless action movie, and let the popular audience veg out to it. And they did, with success. And I am NOT averse to vegging out and watching big, dumb, loud action movies. (Read my review of Pacific Rim). No, what really gets me is, here Abrams and team go to all the trouble to re-imagine the (geeked out) Star Trek universe as the (vegged out) Star Wars Universe, but with Star Trek characters, and then they are too fucking lazy to come up with a new story for their new alternate universe, and instead make a bad remake of Wrath of Khan, but, you know, different. The Star Wars version, with no thought required.Ah. That's fine. You know what? Fuck you Abrams. Go make your goddamn Star Wars movie for Disney. It'll be fantastic and make a ton of money. But, please, please stay out of the geek-out fiction aisle. Don't make any more Star Treks. Stick with mindless Star Wars style entertainment, and future generations will thank you for it, as they sit in their modular cubicle homes, munching Soylent Green flakes and taking up as little space and energy as possible. (Whoops, and! And! Pictures!)"},

Record low highs this past weekend made it feel like late September. I don't particularly mind this, but I would like more of summer, seeing as I haven't gotten to have a summer. (Meaning no physical outdoor activities because of this dang swollen kidney of mine).Speaking of which, my next procedure is August 14th. Similar to the one on 7/2, but they work on my right kidney. It turns out, that ureter is threatening to seal up as well, and they will resect that side of the bladder and put a stent in the ureter until everything heals. My understanding is this can turn from an outpatient procedure into an overnight stay at the hospital if they need to perform a percutaneous nephrostomy to get the stent in. And then the stent is in for a week or so, and I will be very uncomfortable and unable to ignore this thing. And also the Foley catheter.So, joy.And we will haven't address the very sad left kidney, which they keep threatening to remove. If (after a second opinion confirms it), they do have to remove it, that will happen in late September.I keep telling the doc that, if he just gives that kidney half a chance, it will bounce back. He didn't seem convinced. But then, he scoped my bladder out to see how the resection had gone, and he said \"Holy shit! You are completely healed!\"And I replied \"I told you! I told you! What did I tell you? I'm a fucking monster!\"Friends down in Indiana, who know me well, and know I am almost indestructible when it comes to getting knocked around, said \"Shit, with you, if they take it out, it'll just grow back\".No one is worried about me down there.So, the plan is to accomplish as much as I can over the next two weeks with bronze casting and glass casting. I have two glass castings in the kiln which should be out this Wednesday. I have about eight or so waxes ready to be rigged up and invested and burned out and cast in bronze. I'm really hoping I can get all that done before the 14th, but reality says \"Probably not\".I'll give it a shot anyway.Oh, and a picture!Tentatively classified as M. blinkii"},

What with cameras and microphones now about the size of microbes, and the inevitable pairing of Kinect sensors (and who knows what else?) with Google glass, privacy is basically a thing of the past and ubiquitous surveillance a barely yawn-worthy present.Not only that, but given the increasing sophistication of programs that can determine, not only your habits, gestures, facial tics, microfluctuations of blood vessels underneath your skin, pupil size, gaze direction, not to mention computer recognition of microexpressions, it doesn't take a mechanical Sherlock to put the clues together to figure out all of your dirty little secrets. Top that off with just what can be data-mined from a general surveillance, it's inevitable that pretty much your entire public life will be categorized and catalogued. Throw in the GPS of cell phones, bots that are 100 eyed Arguses keeping track of every single video feed in the world, drones of every shape and size, and you've got almost everything covered. Almost. Next step, I suppose would be smart dust, or orphids, if they are not already here.And most people don't seem too upset about that. I mean, when the Pentagon Papers were released, people said \"Holy shit! Those dirty hippies were right! We've been lied to by the government!\" And there was a bit of an uproar. Fast forward to Edward Snowden releasing data about the NSA and PRISM, or wikileaks leaking Bradley Manning's files, and people shrugged and said \"Yeah? So? What is else is new?\"They don't seem particularly upset. And they don't seem particularly upset that private marketing corporations take the same data (and in fact, even better data, since consumers volunteer it) and sell it to other corporations.People don't mind a trade-off of privacy if it means getting a bargain.So maybe what has to happen to get people riled is for private corporations to start using blackmail, threatening to air their dirty laundry (and believe me, you really don't need to be much of a Sherlock to piece together disparate clues from people's lives to figure out what their dirty laundry is).Probably not.Take me. I refuse to go on Facebook. Part of it is not wanting to be harvested (but let's face it, my data has been thoroughly gleaned and pocketed by Google), but mainly it's because, when I did set up an account, way back in 2006, I was almost immediately friended by people I never wanted to see again. (That's really why I'm not on Facebook, and it's kept the unwanted contacts down to zero). Am I missing out? Yeah, sure, so what? I'm also a lot less distracted.Hell, it took me forever to get a loyalty card to Jewel, the supermarket I shop at. It was only when I realized I really didn't give a shit what my shopping habits revealed (because, let's face it unless Jewel starts selling porn and illicit drugs, there's nothing I'm particularly upset about them finding out, and even then, I don't really care who knows that I look at porn or do drugs, uh, which I don't, at least, not so you could notice). But finally I did get a loyalty card, and about a month later they got rid of them.Why?They say they are going back to the Old Skool approach, but I figure, they already got everything that they wanted. And their HAL9000 told them there was no more worthwhile data to mine. Besides, everybody has a cellphone now, and they can just track them through the store, and along with surveillance cameras and who knows what else, can keep track of foot traffic, retention rates, dwell times, posture, cadence, brand loyalty, etc. etc.So, should I be worried? Should I disassemble my TV, my computer, get one of those bug tracking devices? Should I start wearing a ski-mask? A veil? Dark glasses?

It usually translates as \"We'll show you what's what\", and is what Nikita Krushchev (pronounced Kroos-chyuv) was purported to say how the Kennedy administration should perceive the test. But, given the usage of 'mother' in Russian and other languages, one can't help but throw in the \"Yo' momma\" connotation, as in \"Yup tvai-you mat'\": \"I fuck your mother\". Interestingly, Novaya Zemlya is probably one of the most radioactively polluted sites on the planet, and what with global warming opening up a permanent Northwest Passage along Russia's north coast, promises to unhatch all sorts of interesting horrors formerly trapped in ice.Around the same time, the United States was conducting Operation Argus in the South Atlantic, launching H-bombs into orbit at the Earth's geomagnetic equator, supposedly to influence the van Allen radiation belts.I have to ask \"Why such a large Soviet bomb against a barren archipelago above the Arctic Circle?\" and also \"Why a series of large American bombs in the middle of the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly?\".Were I given to flights of paranoid fantasy, I'd think that Krushchev wasn't referring to us Americans when he spoke of the \"them\" he wanted to fuck the mother of on a barren ice covered isolated piece of desolation.

{"title": "John Dies At The End: A Review", "date": "Sunday, July 21, 2013", "text": "You know, I wanted to like this horror comedy movie. I really did. But this may be one time when popular taste is looking like the wisdom of crowds. The movie based upon a horror parody book by Jason Pargin (senior editor at Cracked.com), written under the pseudonym David Wong. It's basically applying a mashup of the slacker trope with H.P. Lovecraftian unspeakable eldritch horrors beyond your ken from other dimensions that might be mistaken for demons trope.I'll just say right off that I found the movie too clever by half, with far too may self-conscious winks and nods, more cutesy than brilliant, probably not scary enough, but maybe too grisly for the squeamish (although given my current experiences involving bodily functions and various exudations and indignities, my grisly and gruesome pole-vault bar is set rather high, and so the last thing you could call me at the moment is squeamish), and therefore not really sure what its audience is beyond comic book crowd, and the sardonic smirking hipster doofus types (which of course means it fails to engage me, though I wanted it to).I think Mundanes, which is to say those not particularly engaged in speculative thinking, will find it possibly mind blowing, worth maybe a \"Whoa!\", but reading a blurb on the DVD back that calls it a \"punk rock Ghostbusters\" should clue most people in. Then there's the jacket blurb for the book, which suggests it is \"a cross between Douglas Adams and Stephen King\", and that stops me right there.Yes, I know that there are people out there that are big, big fans of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and various King novels. I am not one of them. Adams I found ordinary and unfunny - seriously unfunny. It's not a cultural Atlantic divide thing. It's not a \"you just don't get him because he's so brilliantly English\" thing. He's just not funny. He's bland, OK? Nothing original, no new tropes, and nothing to add to existing tropes and ideas. If you are developmentally arrested at the age of twelve, you'll find Douglas Adams brilliant. Sorry if that offends you, but it needs to be said. The future history of the human race may depend upon it. (And yes, I have said before I'm 56 going on 12, but not that 12).And Stephen King? I've never made it past a paragraph of any of his works. He's a HACK, ok? Deal with it. You want scary, grotesque and macabre? Read Robert Bloch. Read Naked Lunch. Read Harlan Ellison's Dangerous Visions. Read, really, any true life horror story, especially the real American ones, whose national character is fundamentally (because, you know, Freedumb) deeply and permanently antisocial and psychotic.No, really, you want a real life horror story? Watch Pat Buchanan. Any doubts that that fecal grease-ball is not some eldritch horror in barely human form, escaped from some deeply twisted dark contorted purple dimension, ready to burst out from its cage of skin in an explosion of toxic blood and rancid semen, wet shiny gristle and serrated bone, crimson ooze, acid bile, and dried-up hard little shrapnel projectiles of invertebrate shit, should be laid to rest just by experiencing him for more than a minute. Seriously.Here's my deal. Horror stories have always worked better in print or on the radio, where the imagined horrors that spring from the Theater of the Mind work far better than any visual presentation. So horror movies already have one strike against them.This movie is about aliens that might be demons that might be alternate reality creatures from parallel dimensions, and the protagonists (who can experience this through some parachronic urberdimensional ichor of a drug nicknamed Soy Sauce) that go up against them.I'm not sure when the whole parallel dimensions trope got started. Of course, you've got the fantasy and fairy tales, that speak of the other world, the half-world, the world of Faerie, the hells and heavens and realms of supernatural beings. And it gets put on a solid scientific footing by H.G. Wells. But most of us get our first taste through the Outer Limits or the Twilight Zone. And, of course, that puts the whole supernatural angels and demons on a rational footing, and makes it palatable to us modern Enlightenment  types (you know, the ones have committed mass murder on an unprecedented scale these past five hundred years). What was I saying?Okay, so the director is Don Coscarelli, who did Phantasm and Bubba Ho Tep, both mildly amusing and watchable movies. I suspect the same person who did the cute creature effects in Phantasm also was recruited for this movie. Meaning, you can't be too scared by the critters, or at least I wasn't. (And, of course there's the obligatory head-explodes-from-shotgun-blast  scene which I think most people are immune to by now). Speaking of Phantasm, the scariest part of that movie was the Tall Man, played by Angus Scrimm, who appears in JDATE as Father Shellnut.Here's my problem. There are too many throw away bits in the movie. There's clever stuff, no question, but it doesn't move the plot forward, or enhance our appreciation of the characters, or explore an idea to the point of circus geek clarity. It wants to be geek movie. All the noises and tags and labels are there, but when you expect some nice little monologue or tidbit, you get smarmy and sardonically hip contemporary references, and throw away lines that will be dated and unknown in, wow, maybe just a few months. And some of the lines are straight from the book because sounding them (and credit the actors for trying, A for effort) through the mouthparts makes them sound stilted and contrived.It's not that I didn't enjoy the movie. It's not that I didn't laugh out loud at some of the bits. But it could have been a great movie, and that's perhaps my problem and not yours. This happens a lot to me. I'll point out how I would have improved the movie, and I suppose that leaves me open to the criticism of, well, then make a better movie. To which I reply, childishly, well maybe I will! So there!So, my version of the movie would be that TV is actually the most evil creation ever conceived in the existence of the multiverse. Some creature from before the beginning of time (trapped in some ironic and visionary Philip K Dickian prison pocket universe) wants to run the whole ball of wax, all of creation, all versions of it, even the shitty ones, and (somehow) sends out evil emanations to various sapient creatures to create TV. Philo T. Farnsworth could be the hero who discovers too late his awful mistake in creating electronic television. He is a mentor from beyond the grave (maybe?) to (natch) the two hipster doofus heroes who must save humanity. Meanwhile, David Sarnoff has been possessed by the ancient evil ones, and that pretty much explains David Sarnoff and RCA for real in real life. And also explains, basically, the whole unholy alliance that is the American corporate culture.  GE is just the absorbed vehicle of unspeakable evil, and the whole point of jumbotrons is to create dimensional portals big enough to let the titanic evil force through into our world.  See, me, I like villains seemingly unstoppable and invincible, because it allows them to have a playful and generous sense of humor, like, you know, a cute little murderous fucking kitty cat playing with a mouse. It's so cute and adorable. But I'd avoid the whole save-the-world trope. A lot of people got to die, with only a fortunate lucky few making it to the other side, a little the worse for wear. And, of course, one undeserving survivor who gets it right before the end credits. Because the main lesson of horror movies is you can't avoid the end. You can only postpone it.Cut to utter darkness. Cue evil laughter."},

I have a theory that there is a direct correlation between fame and assholes, but the question is are assholes attracted to fame, or does fame bring out the asshole that is in each of us? Or is that even the right question?Portraits in Emmett Brown's LabI think the biggest mistake made in the movie Back To The Future was that Doc Brown enshrined the pictures of Isaac Newton, Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison, and Albert Einstein. All of them were kind of douches. Isaac, we now know, was a bit of a pscyhopath. Franklin, a shameless self-promoter, slagged off his working class buddies the second he earned some serious coin. Edison, well, took way too much credit for practically everything his workers did, and couldn't admit to (as most successful people can't) the immensely huge role that luck and accident played in his successes. They get all puffed up and turn into autocrats. Einstein, to a lesser extent, was a douche. He treated his wife, Mileva Marić, like shit, and could never admit he was wrong about quantum mechanics. Worse still, he convinced a lot of people not to believe in quantum mechanics, which meant that a lot of brain power went to waste on pointless hidden variable theories. (Thankfully, people like John Bell could turn the tables on their own beliefs, but that's not the point).So, I don't really have heroes, but if I did have portraits on the wall, they might be Oliver Evans, Antoine Lavoisier,  Hans Bethe, and Richard Feynman. Nice guys, everyone, and who says nice guys finish last?Feynman took time out for anyone... pretty much anyone, and had the good sense to know that he was his own biggest fool. Bethe likewise, would discuss even the most ludicrous ideas with anyone, regardless of their reputation or stature or lack thereof. (Oh, true, Bethe was midwife to the H-bomb, but you can't have everything). Both Bethe and Feynman are regular guys, patient teachers, open to discussion, but can back up their criticisms or dismissals of ideas with solid arguments. These qualities are something I notice I lack and wish to aspire to.Lavoisier, I admire for his constant determination. Lavoisier managed to make modern observations within the realm of chemistry with the most primitive of equipment. He almost single-handedly turned alchemy into chemistry. True, he was a rich guy using state of the art (for the time) stuff, but that's all the more reason to admire him. Despite his riches, he knew he was fortunate, and so made the most use of his time and efforts. Too often, I will give up on a task, not because it is hard, but because it looks hard. I really am, more often than not, a lazy and slovenly mo. I really need to work on that.And Oliver Evans? Talk about ahead of his time! Long before that asshole, that enormous asshole, that militantly, ignorantly, pridefully enormous asshole Henry Ford appeared on the scene, there was Oliver Evans. Evans created and installed the world's first automatic production line (flour mills). Evans built the first wheeled vehicle to move under its own power. Evans built the first amphibious vehicle. And, Evans built and manufactured the first effective high pressure steam engine. What do I take from Oliver? Aside from being a true mechanical genius, he is surrounded at every turn by thieves, frauds, and mountebanks - leaches who either take credit, or profit from his work without recompense. He persevered, established a family going in the form of the Mars Works, a steam engineering plant in Pittsburgh, PA.Oh, right! Almost forgot. This wax didn't make it. The plaster/silica mold for glass broke apart under my handling. I suppose, were I patient and perseverating, I could make another, better one:"},
{"title": "Animal Wise: A Book Report", "date": "Wednesday, July 17, 2013", "text": "Animal Wise: The Thoughts and Emotions of Our Fellow Creatures by Virginia Morell.I'd say it's pretty obvious that animals are conscious, possessed of emotional and cognitive abilities, wouldn't you say?I mean, the etymology of animal is the Latin animale \"living being, being which breathes,\" neuter of animalis \"animate, living; of the air,\" from anima \"breath, soul; a current of air\", so clearly even the ancients recognized this fact. It was only from about the beginnings of the 20th century, with the rise of the behaviorists, and the stricture to avoid any anthropomorphism in ethology (the study of animal behaviors) that we treated animals as machines. That has resulted in some pretty gruesome experiments.Virginia Morell's book is more than just anecdotes about animal behaviors. More and more evidence, in the form both observation and statistics, tell us that not only are most animals conscious, but, in their own way, intelligent, and most importantly, capable of suffering.(Is that going to stop me from eating things that have a face? Unlikely. I have a very well developed cognitive dissonance built up in that department. And besides, the things that don't have a face are - with exception of shellfish - not particularly palatable. I myself have killed and eaten chickens, and the only traumatic part that I could see was the distress they suffered in me trying to catch them. So, I'm gonna eat animals, but I do think our food animals should be treated and killed in as painless and humane a manner as is humanly possible).In any case, Morell walks us through the animal kingdom, and the people who study them in a very engaging and easily read book. She's starts with ants and ends with apes. Along the way, we hear about  fish, birds, rats, elephants, dolphins, dogs, and chimps. I've no need to write about the latter three. I think everyone agrees that those animals have got it going on brain-wise.So, the chapters on the \"higher\"(forgive me for employing the outdated notion of the ladder of superiority) mammals and birds I sort of skimmed. I was much more interested in finding out how the \"lower\" orders fare.Ants, for example, are fascinating. At least, when we were kids, my younger brother thought so. We'd find him out in the yard, sitting still, and watching ants. He'd pick a rock or a brick and expose the egg chamber. We'd ask him what he was doing, and he would say \"Watching the young leebles\". It turned out the \"young leebles\" were the pupae, which the ants, in what seemed a panic, actually very purposefully rescued from exposure and secured down further within the nest.  Those ants weren't panicking, they were efficient, fast, businesslike, admirably competent in their tasks. Would that some individuals I know possessed the intelligence of those hives, those nests, life would be a lot simpler.Are ants conscious? Your average ant possesses about a hundred thousand neurons in its brain, which is tiny. We humans, with our hundred billion neurons and ten times as many astrocytes and glial cells sneer at such a number. But that's not the way to look at them.The brain of an ant is a gem, a real jewel of a brain. It ants were made of semi-precious stones, perhaps we'd appreciate their behavior better. But the one thing we notice about an ant is how smart they really are. I mean, as multicellular creatures go, I'm starting to think that the term instinct is useless. There is some seriously complex computations going, all the way down to the molecular level. And we find out that not only can ants modify their behaviors beyond the limits of so-called \"instinct\", it turns out they can learn, they can imitate, they can teach. About this, researcher Nigel Franks muses:\"I would never say that these ants are thinking, but that's what intrigues me - because in many ways, they behave as if they were thinking. They've taught me that very sophisticated behaviors don't necessarily involve thought or language or theory of mind\".That's the really fascinating part about this book. When it comes to artificial intelligence, we humans really have a long way to go to even approximate something as \"simple\" as a fish or an ant colony.Speaking of fish, that was one of the disturbing chapters. A study was done in Great Britain and the questions was asked, \"Are fish conscious?\" but really the question was \"Do fish suffer?\".And the answer, according to Victoria Braithwaite, a fish biologist at Pennsylvania State University, was \"Yes\". Not only do they feel pain, they are cognizant of it, and the upsetting thing is a neuronal map of pain receptors has a large concentration around the lips. I say \"upsetting\" because I like to fish. I'm not fanatic about it, haven't fished in years as a matter of fact, but when I do fish again, I'll be using barbless hooks.So, I guess the next question is, what about insects? Can insects suffer? Am I gonna end up a Buddhist? Not bloody likely.To summarize my reading experience, light summer reading with occasional delightful anecdotes and insights."},
{"title": "The Real Kaiju", "date": "Monday, July 15, 2013", "text": "\"Helpless people on subway trains Wave goodbye as they scream and die\" - Blue Öyster CultThat's not how it went, but how I remember it. Here's how it actually went:Prior to seeing Pacific Rim, I felt I needed some context. So, I watched the original Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, not be confused with Gojira. Gojira is the 1954 Japanese movie, and Godzilla is the 1956 Americanized version starring Raymond Burr.I'm convinced that both versions would bomb today, just as Pacific Rim would be viewed as an incoherent mess in 1956. Credit a lifetime of TV watching and video game playing for the difference.This is not to say that the current generation is entirely jaded. I had a class of ten-year-olds, boys and girls, watch me pour molten aluminum into a sand mold flask this past Friday, and I got to tell you they went bananas over me pulling a red hot crucible out of the furnace, and positively ape-shit watching the amazing quicksilver molten aluminum pour into the mold. I can only hope that experience stays with them for awhile.The movie plays as a detective story for nearly the first half until the first appearance of the monster. However, the use of psychological tension is quite effective. For example the slow paced deep bass thundering of the unseen monster's footsteps in the night is very unnerving. The special effects and action scenes may seem quaint today, but the aftermath scenes of the suffering humans are what are really important (for anyone who can realize that the WWII firebombing of Tokyo is barely a decade old, and I'm sure the Japanese audience was aware of this).Not surprisingly, the Godzilla was panned by US critics as a cheap horror movie. Nevertheless, it was a  big success with audiences in the States. More importantly, the movie managed to get away with a subversive, indeed, almost unpatriotic, message about US H-bomb tests in the Pacific (those tests are blamed in the movie for resurrecting Godzilla from his Jurassic slumber).So, memories of WWII notwithstanding, this was also during the time when the United States was conducting H-bomb tests in the South Pacific. The message was pretty clear to anyone with a small amount of introspection that the real giant monster here was the United States of America. (Unfortunately, many Japanese engaged in self-pity and victimization, rather than realize it was pretty fucking stupid to attack the Eastern Kaiju on Dec. 7th, 1941).But of course, that's what we (the USA) were and still are. That's pretty obvious, isn't it?Kind of makes you proud, in a sick, twisted, perverse way.Oh, and, fresh out of the kiln, two machinerettes in cast glass, tentatively identified as  M. gumbo:And two freshly cast bronze machinerettes, M. firxii, and M. corona, repsectively:"},
{"title": "Pacific Rim: A Review", "date": "Sunday, July 14, 2013", "text": "I'm of the opinion that spoilers do not ruin a movie for me. If you don't agree, then stop reading now and go see Pacific Rim, because it... is.... freaking... AWESOME!Qualifier to above enthusiastic endorsement: Is this a fun-but-dumb movie? Yes! Excellent! Does it matter? Hell, no! I doubt that will be a problem, because if you don't get that, you won't be seeing the movie anyway. Me? Since I am 56 going on 12, I will be seeing it at least one more time, and then again on video with subtitles. There is a huge amount of visual information to absorb, and unfortunately I made the mistake of seeing it in 3D, which distracted from the experience.Spoilers ahead: Okay, so you're reading anyway?A minor spoiler, and one that can be overlooked: everyone in this movie is a hero*. There are no sneaky little snake in the grass bureaucrats like the Secretary of Defense wonderfully played by James Rebhorn in the fun-but-really-really-dumb movie Independence Day. Okay, okay, the UN (*cough*the 1%*cough*) representatives, ready to slag off the giant robot program in favor of a really big seawall ringing the Pacific that we all know won't work) are minor villains.But the real, true heroes of this movie are the two nerdy scientists, Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia), and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman, and let me say that Burn does a fantastic mashup of Joel Grey's Master of Ceremonies in the movie Cabaret and Peter Sellers' Dr. Strangelove - a slightly depraved and demented Werner von Braun, but with with some warm humanity underneath and none of the used-slave-labor-for-Nazi-V2-rockets-past to deal with).Sure, you've got the Jaeger (giant robot) pilots (known as Rangers, perhaps in a nod to the Japanese merchandizing market, and really, Jaegermeister must be slapping their foreheads), you've got the engineers and construction workers and everyone who has managed to construct an impossibly huge and impressive infrastructure to combat the kaiju, and most everyone is brave and dedicated and altruistic, but Humanity just does not get saved without those two seeming comic-relief roles.Let me stress this point, because it is easy to lose sight in all the fantastic mayhem of who the real heroes are, and I'm going give writer Travis Beacham the benefit of the doubt that that (that meaning that scientists are people that identify and solve hard problems through drudgery and risk-taking and hard-to-do shit like math and physics, but still hugely fun, nerdy, enthusiastic nine-year-old kids) was intentional. My only quibble is there should have been a lady scientist in there somewhere for the geek girls to cheer on.Let me step back for a moment. The speculative writer and possible genius Neal Stephenson once remarked that entertainment consists of either geeking out or vegging out. So, vegging out is obvious, in that you turn off your brain and watch the fireworks. Geeking out, much more rewarding, involves the exploration of ideas and themes. Example of vegging out: any Star Wars movie. No brain required. Example of geeking out: speculative fiction in general, but perhaps some of the better episodes of Star Trek.I can tell you right now that this movie is a gold mine, and will generate tons of merchandizing, and comic books and maybe a cartoon TV show and bad rip-offs, but it will also generate a huge amount of geeking out in order to rationalize the absurdities and impossibilities presented in the movie. There will be many explanations of exactly what kind of wires and cables are necessary to suspend disbelief. And I think that's good. After all, Star Trek inspired Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre to figure out how to build a warp drive. Perhaps explaining away giant robots will inspire people to figure how to get some really immense energy densities out of our power sources and batteries.We are going to ignore the fact that building a bipedal giant robot or monster is a majorly stupid idea. We will have to ignore the fact that an entire industry and infrastructure, a massively huge undertaking, is accomplished in a mere five to ten years by nations that haven't built anything big in a generation (save for the People's Republic of China). We have to ignore that the use of the standard terrestrial organic chemistry can build twenty story tall monsters (I mean, come on, there's no freaking way those giant bones are calcium phosphate). Doesn't matter. Shit will be figured out.Okay, minor quibbles. There are archetypes and stereotypes strewn throughout this movie that are never quite taken advantage of, and that's fine with me, but could have been used to tweak the movie to a little higher performance.Case in point: the Chinese and Russian Jaegers go down far too easily and too quickly. The Russian giant robot looks fantastic, like something out of a medieval nightmare, and the pilots are even better looking. All in all, as an American, it makes me hugely proud that we have such formidable one-time-enemies as allies. (Yes, I know I'm being manipulated). But, knowing what we know about Soviet technology, we know that they are designed to take a licking and keep on ticking, built solid, simple, and simply devastating. So there's no way that Russian Jaeger would have gone down without at least taking a major piece out of giant monster. And the Chinese Jaeger? It's piloted by a freaking acrobatic trio from the Shanghai circus or something. Hell, the freaking thing is the Shanghai Circus. Why, oh, why, did it not whup out some amazingly stunning and spectacular kung fu kick-ass moves is beyond me.Perhaps the idea was to show how much of a badass the American-built Gipsy Danger robot is. But come on, you know the Americans are going to put too many bells and whistles in their machine. It's going to break down. A lot. It would be the first to fail. (Unless, of course, they somehow managed to pick the right people for the job, which occasionally happens).And where the heck are the German and Japanese Jaegers? For that matter, why are the major shipbuilding nations not represented?  Perhaps this will be addressed in the sequel, which, from the visuals behind the end credits you know has to be made. (And here is my suggestion. For the sequel? Two words. Christopher Walken. Doesn't really matter what role. Doesn't really matter what dialog. Even \"more cowbell\" would suffice. Oh, and a very smart female scientist who bests our loveable geeks in the figuring out of shit, but doesn't become a romantic interest).So, there you go. I give it 10 out of 10 stars, and the film critics who didn't like it clearly have a stick up their ass and don't know how to have fun. (And one was even dumb enough to think that the kaiju used to be dinosaurs, when clearly the message was the kaiju wiped out the dinosaurs. Sheesh!). *Even Hannibal Chau is kind of a hero, played by the ever entertaining Ron Perlman as some type of ex-patriot American turned 1930s Shanghai gangster, (and you must, must sit through the credits to appreciate his character)."},

{"title": "Do Not Habilitate", "date": "Wednesday, June 26, 2013", "text": "About two years ago, I wrote a short essay called \"Is it too late to rehabilitate the Gadsden Flag?\" I asked the question, but never answered it. A certain Mister DeVega of We Are Respectable Negroes, asked to expand into a guest blog, which I did, to mixed reviews. In particular, there was some commenter named Deb who basically accused me of white-washing history and being a racist in denial.This irritated me, as I thought I had said that history was white-washed and I was a racist (as is everyone in America, most especially her included). And so, at the time, I did what Fred Sanford would sometimes do when confronted with a shrill tirade from that wretched old termagant, Aunt Esther, which was to ignore her, turn away and growl to himself.But the thing is, you don't get irritated unless there's something to get irritated about, which was, yes, I was bothered by the past behavior of my native lands. It's true I and my family, recent arrivals, and duly exploited, had nothing to do with the unpleasantness of the 18th and early 19th centuries, but we were, still, by virtue of being white, indirectly rewarded by past injustices.I realize what evils our country has committed (some of the most barbarous acts ever, in history), but was hopeful that, when the balance sheet was composed, with all the pros and cons of America tallied, coupled with what seemed to be social progress, that maybe in the future our country might actually live up to the ideals it set for itself.  Ah, but see, that was mere trending, which doesn't mean spit. And nowadays it appears we are going through our delayed version of Soviet Empire collapse, via top-heavy capitalist excess threatening to capsize the whole market economy. (No, really, have you noticed how increasingly cheap and shoddy everything is becoming? Seems like it's only a matter of time before Americans face empty shelves and are waiting in line for toilet paper).But if you go back and look at the early history of the United States of America, you can't help but notice the places of power were populated by dicks. (And I am going with Louis CK's definition of \"dick\", e.g slaverholder = dick). Seriously, how could Thomas Jefferson write the Declaration of Independence, and looking out out his window at his field hands, his human property, not realize he was a complete dick? And it turns out old Gadsden, Christopher Gadsden was a dick as well. Not only him, but his whole family and descendants (right on down and past his grandson, buddy of that enormous asshole Andrew Jackson, who facilitated the extinction of southeastern indigenous peoples, and finagled a purchase from Mexico after a trumped up war) were every single one of them a dick. Okay, so I'm ready to answer the question. Not only can the Gadsden flag not be rehabilitated, it should never have even have been habilitated.Fuck that yellow snake flag, and the ignorant, amateurish clowns who have lately appropriated it."},

How every little flipper-limbed jellyhead that could squirt out a little brown stain in public or on the media did so? And how much radiation was released? How many people died? Answers: hardly any, and zero.Ah, but let's talk about all the bomb tests from 1946 through 1980. Shit, there was a period in the 1950s where the military was like a bunch goofy little kids with firecrackers. What to blow up next? What NOT to blow up next? Above ground? Underground? Underwater? In space! On barges, on tops of towers, suspended from balloons, you name it. At least, globally half a gigaton of explosions.How many tons of radioisotopes have been distributed globally, to be found in everything alive, from the bones of Yanomami Indians deep in the Amazon, to whale blubber in the Antarctic? The mind boggles. Of course, my favorite is the unofficially named Wiener Roast experiment. The Air Force, determined to build a nuclear plane, and not for any strategic or defense reasons, but solely and selfishly to be part of the cool nukes club, decided they needed to find out what would happen if a nuclear powered plane crashed. As reported in Atomic America: How a Deadly Explosion and a Feared Admiral Changed the Course of Nuclear History, by Todd Tucker:\"To simulate this catastrophe, the Air Force in the summer of 1958  designed a series of experiments  in which they burned to a crisp a series of used nuclear fuel elements in open air. The official name of the experiment was the Fission Products Field Release Test, but it was soon informally dubbed Operation Wiener Roast. Previous crude experiments... had burned highly radioactive, used fuel elements in a section of airplane fuselage filled with kerosene, but the temperatures achieved were not sufficient to melt the fuel elements. (phew!- JK) For Wiener Roast, a special induction furnace was constructed, and in nine separate experiments highly radioactive used fuel elements were incinerated, and a wide, club-shaped swath of contamination was soon mapped in detail across the NRTS... The Wiener Roast experiments were in some ways emblematic of the Air Force's efforts throughout the 1950s. They generated huge amounts of radiation, employed hundreds of scientists, engineers, and servicemen, and generated thousands of pages detailing an effort that was, in its own way, dramatic and impressive. The experiments did not, however, in any discernible way, get the world any closer to a nuclear-powered airplane\".The Air Force effort cost some one billion dollars over the course of nearly thirteen years (1946-1958). Amortized today, that is roughly $12 billion. Your tax dollars at work!"},
{"title": "Stone In My Shoe", "date": "Sunday, June 23, 2013", "text": "I really should just leave this one alone. Especially as I'll be out of touch and not able to address any responses to this immediately.It's such a little thing, it really isn't worth the bother. The fact that I can't just goes to show the exponential growth cycle of mildly irritating things into annoying kind of big things. And the annoying kind of big thing this reminds me of is the ongoing rage and dread that seethes through the American right of both conservative and libertarian stripe, this thirty-on-year temper tantrum of us Americans not doing what is best for us. Yeah, where have I heard that before?Seemingly intelligent people, or people possessed of compartmentalized intelligence, operate under the worldview that there are two camps within this country: the hardworking productive elite, and the indolent masses leeching off their labor through confiscatory taxes and transfer programs.And, since clearly this not only probably immoral but - even more obscene - irrational and inefficient, various Candyland proposals are put forth as viable alternatives. Take, for example, this prime piece of idiocy. Coffee sharing. Isn't that nice? That reeking homeless guy, lying about in his own waste products, can now walk into your tony, trendy coffee place get himself a free cup of coffee courtesy of free market agents! Do I consider the idea of suspended coffee, as it is called, idiotic? No, I consider the idea that somehow:The answer is simple, it cuts out the middleman of government & the compulsion of law and instead uses unregulated markets and the goodness of people's hearts.\"It\" being the act of charity known as suspended coffee. So, the beautiful thing about the quoted sentence is how many logical and empirical fallacies are implicitly embedded within it, and uttered without even the slightest effort at evaluating the scheme as somehow truly eliminating middlemen or the threat coercion, but somehow appealing to the efficiencies and generosities that are so evident every here on planet Earth, the Nice Nice Planet.No, really, let's think about this for a second. Anyone who has spent any time at all working in the retail world knows that two items are guaranteed to produce a profit with the minimum of effort or added value are: coffee and eggs. I could point out the obvious and remark that it is extremely difficult to survive on coffee alone, but since approximately the same markup is involved between coffee and eggs, it really doesn't matter whether we use Denny's or Starbucks as our supply chain model.So let's use Starbucks. On average, the typical markup on a cup of coffee is about 300%. Meaning that 3 dollar cup of suspended coffee you so generously provided that bum at Starbucks could have been made at your house for 25 cents. Good thing there is no government middleman there to crank the price up even higher! Oh, and wait, that coffee Starbucks purchased was through an unregulated market, right? Well, once upon a time it might have been, back in the 1980s before coffee growers banded together. But coffee is a regulated market, voluntarily regulated by growers. Because why, class? What happens to prices in an unregulated market, class? They fluctuate wildly. That's right! So, middlemen like Starbucks can take advantage of inefficient information exchange (arbitrage) and purchase exemptions (lowballing, blackmail, conspiracy) to drive the market to their advantage (bankrupt poor farmers and extract unfair prices from the survivors).  Boy, it's a good thing those poor farmers (or anyone that supplies a product) aren't coerced or compelled in any way towards their ruination.Speaking of coercion, how can anyone buy into the argument that taxation is theft? If taxation is coercion, a denial of choice, then what is profit? Wait. Aren't both a social contract? Isn't taxation more like membership dues? The classic argument is the market presents a choice, whereas taxation does not. Really? That's a red herring, of course. You have a choice in whatever you do. What they really mean in invoking that logical fallacy is: they want a choice with no important consequences.You have a choice not to pay taxes. Should you be expected to enjoy the privileges incurred through the social contract of taxation, such as rule of law, protection of private property through defense, basic human services like water and roads, weather reports, clean food, no poisons in your medicines, things like that? You can leave the country, go someplace where you don't have to pay taxes.  You can also go out into the market and try and pay for a product that has no markup. Let me know when you fulfill that choice.Hopefully, you get the idea. This the problem with libertarians. They are un-communists, in that they refuse to accept any empirical evidence that disproves their utopian social theories.Now, this is not a \"government good, markets bad\" simplistic argument as the reverse is too often employed by the sanctimonious right. The fact of the matter is, this version of charity is neither efficient nor non-compulsory. Someone is always coercing you into doing one or another thing in the real world. The principle of nonaggression is a cloud-cuckoo fantasy. Anyone who lives in the United States of America, where indigenous peoples were aggressively booted off their land, and foreign peoples of a certain skin tone were compelled to work against their will, had better recognize the right of conquest/the absurdity of the principle of non-aggression or prepare to be mercilessly poked fun of.Hey, speaking of charity, I think the point being made really boils down to this:The solution is ideal. It gives the person donating the money complete control. Do they mind that an executive of a company might use their money (the money they worked so hard for, and exchanged for a product) to buy cocaine or child-porn, or importing sex slaves? What's the difference? Is it still their money? And money they give to the government, that's still their money? Nonsense!Ah, see? The keywords I highlighted in the above quote. Complete Control. That's really what it is all about isn't it?  I think it because of that little authoritarian, that little Hitler, that lurks within conservatives and libertarians. Never mind that that money they want to control is no longer theirs. After all, that's the idea of a gift, right? There are plenty of aid organizations that allow them to control how their money is spent. They can choose to contribute to that, but this doesn't absolve them of the responsibilities of living in a society. See, this suggests to me that they ultimately really don't like democracy or trust people. They want you to do what you are told.And that's a big thing. Cute enough in the infantile realm of two- to three-year olds. Evil in an adult realm."},
{"title": "New Cast Glass", "date": "Friday, June 21, 2013", "text": "Fresh out of the kiln. I kept notes. Here's the final shot first:Fresh out of the kiln. I am not entirely displeased with Mutant Gypsy Vacuum Cleaner. The gradation of color is a little ham-handed, and I didn't quite stay within the lines in the transition between figure and background. It is what it is, and I'll not modify my techniques too much. I could cast the mechanicules separately and then embed them in a new casting, but I'm sticking with the plan.The glass is all from Bullseye Glass Company. Ready? I kept notes.  Background color, which I dig, is a layer of True Blue coarse frit, backed by transparent frit, about 50/50 by volume. Figures were backed with transparent frit to avoid color changes.Figures were Canary Yellow, Orange, Red powder, backed by medium grade Red frit.The investment mix was 2 parts 325 mesh silica flour to 1 part #1 potter's plaster by weight, and 2 parts dry mix powder to 1 part water by weight.Firing schedule was:150F/hr to 400F, hold for 48 hours50F/hr to 950F100F/hr to 1550, hold for 6 hoursAFAP to 1260, hold for 2hrs150F/hr to 900F, hold for 12 hours3F/hr to 800F5F/hr to 700F18F/hr to 100FExplanation: The investment mix ratios and firing schedule are what work for me. I have consistently had good results with this. The mix is a little dense and soft compared to most, but it is simple and easy to remember, and works for me. The firing schedule (aside from the back end which was for a 3\" thick casting using Bullseye annealing schedule, The reason I used the 3\" thick schedule, even though the glass was 2\" thick maximum was because the thickness was not uniform (background glass in about 3/4\" thick). is slow compared to most, but I rarely get cracks in the mold, and so it works for me. This time out, I was very surprised to find a crack. Judging from the flashing, it must have happened on the down ramp after the casting soak. Eh, so what.See the crack?Decanted from mold, not cleaned up yet.Investment scrubbed off before bead blastingBacklit glassI'm going to put it into a frame later, and perhaps put a mirror behind the glass for a partial backlighting.I've also finished rigging up some more machinerettes for bronze casting in a coffee can mold (same investment material as the glass):So, the funny thing is, the sense of urgency I've felt about getting all this stuff done by the end of August is now compounded by the fact that I have a little health problem. Turns out that pulled muscle in my lower back was not a pulled muscle, but an obstruction in the ureter of my left kidney. There's a cyst impacting it, which caused the kidney to swell up with urine to the size of a grapefruit or something. And then, Tuesday morning, in some of the worst belly pain I've ever had, to the point of nausea and puking, I drove myself to the emergency room. After an MRI, it was determined that my left kidney had basically exploded and sent a gush of urine into the abdominal cavity, thus causing the belly pain. So, I'm operating on one kidney, and I'm scheduled for outpatient surgery next Tuesday with a urologist. He will probably put a stent in my ureter. Worst case involves removing the kidney, and I will definitely be wanting a second opinion on that shit.In the meantime, I'm on Vicodin and tylenol and seem to be handling it OK. We'll see. So, I'm trying to get as much shit done as I can before Tuesday morning."},
{"title": "The Arithmetic of Interstellar Travel Revisited", "date": "Wednesday, June 19, 2013", "text": "I gave the subject short shrift, but considering I was a little busy at the time, I forgive myself.As Quiggin pointed out, sending 10,000 colonists to a planet 1200 light years away requires a multi-generational ship that can survive in interstellar space. Any civilization with that ability has no need of planets. I'll go further and say that any ship that can survive in interstellar space must not only be self-sustaining and self-repairing, it must by definition be not only a world unto itself, but a world that can self-replicate. In which case, all such a ship needs is a decent energy flux and some mass to exist and reproduce. Planets? Nebulae will work as well. Dust clouds. Ah, but with one slight proviso, that I'll get to in a minute.Well, fact is sending canned ape to the stars is probably the worst idea ever conceived. If it happens, and I doubt it will, it's going to be robots that do it. Or some unknown magical technology that various speculative fiction authors have played with.But let's get to the more interesting possibility of 10,000 colonists on the Moon by 1978. As I once pointed out, there were plans to continue lunar exploration. But the fact is, no plausible scenario can be created that would have resulted in a lunar base. Public interest simply wasn't there. Even the one demographic which was supersaturated into a maximal sugar high - the youth of the 1960s - couldn't sustain any realistic interest. And the Mundanes - the lumpen-proles drinking beer and watching black and white television shows - displayed the appropriate interest at the appropriate time (the Apollo 11 moon landing), and then moved on. Perhaps, if, say, we were a sane species, and had not invested some tens of trillions of dollars in mutual assured destruction, perhaps there might have been room for a moonbase in the 1970s, but that was not to be. So, the social incentive was not there, could never have been there, unless it had turned out that something remarkable was out there that was worth investigating/exploiting/avoiding.  You know, TMA-1, extraterrestrial amazon babes, or moon dust gives men giant stiffies, or some such thing.Interesting thing, though, about that MAD program. As Neal Stephenson points out (as pointed out to him by Dr. Jordin Kare), you don't get the Moon Stunt without the insanity, or at least a semi-improbable series of events that results in rockets big enough to hurl large payloads into orbit contingent upon:1) Mid-20th century world's most technologically advanced nation under absolute control  of superweapon-obsessed madman develops rockets2)  Astonishing advent of atomic bombs at exactly the same time3)  A second great power dominated by secretive, superweapon-obsessed dictator4) Nuclear/strategic calculus militating in favor of ICBMs as delivery system5) Geographic situation of adversaries necessitating that ICBMs have near-orbital capability6) Manned space exploration as propaganda competition, unmoored from realistic cost/benefit disciplineThat's Stephenson presentation. Allow me a different wording. Nazi Germany creates basic rocket technology which cannot hit shit. America creates fission bombs using 1930s theory and 1920s technology. Stalin threatens to lop off heads if he doesn't get both technologies for his birthday. Rockets and H-bombs are a marriage made in heaven as rocket's guidance systems can barely hit the broad side of a city, H -bombs are only good for destroying cities. Mutual targets in the USA and USSR require rockets that can reach orbit. Other things the size of H-bombs, like communications satellites and space capsules can be launched. As a result, the Apollo program is the greatest triumph of Communism ever.(And, of course, let's not forget the burgeoning computational and data processing industries, created by the Federal government due to the fact that targeting cities with H-bomb using 1930s-style electronic brains with vacuum tubes and switchboards was horrendously inaccurate and wasteful, much more sophisticated electronic computers were required to the job, thus subsidizing all of those libertarian code-monkeys literally into existence, but that's for another time). It would seem that had the original Apollo program been carried through, with ten moon landings, followed by a semi-permanent lunar base, followed by a more permanent lunar laboratory, there was a chance that many of the things we know now (water on the moon), would have made a colonizing effort more palatable. Ignoring the total lack of public support, could it have been done? Could a colony of 10,000 have been established by 1978.The answer is yes. But a qualified yes. I'll not go into the space geek stuff. Clearly, turning Detroit into Rocket City, getting launch costs down through an economy of scale from cranking out space ships like sausages, is believe it or not, the easy part. (And think of what Detroit would look like today? Wow!) Again the greatest difficulty about building nuclear rockets is not the technical aspect but the legal and diplomatic ramifications of having the danged things fly over your airspace. That kind of technical wanking, though fascinating is actually the minor part.The biggest problem is all the deaths. If prior colonization efforts are to be used as comparison (most fairly successful under more or less optimal conditions of having air to breath and water to drink), then perhaps the closest analogy to a permanent moon colony would be the distastrous colonizing history of Jamestown. Famine, inclement weather, hostile natives, resulted in about a 80% mortality rate for English colonists. I would expect the same for Moon colonists. So, to get 10,000 hearty souls to thrive on the Moon by 1978, I would expect at least 50,000 Americans must die. Well, what's that? Less than World War I, more than Vietnam. Could Americans accept that death toll without hostilities to justify it? I kind of doubt it.And then, that proviso I mentioned? There's the really big bugaboo, the elephant in the room that no one really wants to address. You know the basic rule of real estate? Well, in space exploration, it's radiation, radiation, radiation.The average stay on the ISS is about 200 times as bad as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for a year. I don't know if that's true, but it can't be far off. And living on the Moon is not that much different. Oh sure, you can live underground, but it's amazing how living 100 miles at the bottom of an ocean of air can protect you from all those really nasty things that a Moon bunker can't protect you from. Cosmic rays - near-light-speed atomic particles, gamma rays, shit like that, just tears right through you. It would seem, if you want to exist in space, you would like to come up with some type of material substrate for consciousness that eats gamma rays for breakfast, that actually thrives on being composed of unstable nuclei. Robots won't hack it. Conventional electronics get fried. What's a boy to do?  I don't know, but no conventional matter will last long on the lunar surface. You got to dig down, like way down, like kilometers down below the surface. Have fun with that.Which, of course, addles your already insane cost/benefit calculations. Bummer."},

Funny thing is, about forty years ago, this was pretty close to reality. Except I was a blonde.Yes, I was beautiful once... for about two weeks in 1975. Now I just look like a goofy old guy wearing a wig.The cast glass is here! The cast glass is here! Things are going to start happening to me now!I know preppers get a lot of shit with their doom-monger end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it-is-a-coming reputations, but I can sympathize with them. A lot of them are just planning for emergencies. Considering retail stores carry only three days worth of food, it makes sense to prepare for a two to four week delay in the supply chain. Any longer than that seems pointless though. If conditions are such that you need a year's or a decade's worth of supplies, I figure that will be the least of your worries.But I appreciate the just-in-case attitude. I myself am a prepper, but in a different way. Some people collect things, like wristwatches or Bugattis. Me, I collect skills. I figure that puts me way ahead of most preppers that are just stockpiling (but I'm guessing most also value survival skills). Me, I value not survival skills, which really for a generalist scavenger/predator such are ourselves is almost second nature and easy to pick up, but civilizational survival skills.So, when uglyblackjohn mentioned that I make stuff... from scratch, well, that isn't exactly true, but it makes for a good exercise. What if I did want to make one of my bronze pieces literally from scratch? What would be the ground rules here?Well, actually, in post-apocalyptic world, with all of our trashed stuff laying around, metals already smelted and purified, tools at hand, probably some fuel and generator and electricity available, well, that's just too easy. How about we eliminate the majority of conveniences that the modern web of technology places before us? I'm figuring setting the wayback machine to partly 1830 or so, with bits going back to, say, 5000BCE.That means, here I am, 20 miles west of Chicago, with no tools, no metal, no coke or coal or oil or gas, no electricity, and I am to make a bronze critter. What do I got to do?I'll need metal, for starters. A kiln or furnace. A smelter. Wax. Tools. Fuel. That's the minimum.Let's start with metal. The bronze we use is Everdur, 94% copper, 4% silicon, 2% manganese, a marine bronze noted for it's resistance to corrosion. Aside from public works, it's also used for ship's propellors among many other things. I can't make that. I can probably make the old ancient bronze which is 60% copper, 40% tin. Where would I find. Here where I am, bedrock is a good hundred feet down underneath glacial till, clay and sand, and the bedrock that is there is limestone. Not much use even if I could get to it. The clay and sand I will take, as I will need that for my kiln and/or furnace.Well, guess what, I don't know where there is a ready source. It would seem that knowing skills is not enough, knowing other people that do know this shit would be better. (So, where's Mister Dee Ray Metallica when you need him?)It seems my do it yourself project has already evolved into a do it with others project. Funny that.Well, actually, I do know the UP of Michigan has very nice veins of copper, parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota as well. I might have to google where I can find tin stone ore, but as it so happens, younger brother spent some time on Isle Royale in the middle of Lake Superior (he is fascinated with moose and wolves), and he told me there are both copper and tin mines on that island. Great!Not so great! How the fuck am I going to get there? I could a raft out of logs, but, uh, hmm, ship building is not in my skill set. I can ride a horse, so that's gets me up to the shore of the lake at least in short amount of time, and let's haul shit without ruining my back. I just have to find a horse, and then find someone who can help with the boat.Okay, let's assume somehow that all worked out and here I am back in Illinois with a couple dozen pounds of ore. (One the assumption that I only need about two pounds of bronze). Do I know how to smelt copper and tin? No. Shit. Better find someone who does. Let's assume I do.I suppose I'm going to have help out making the smelter, which I would assume could be done in a sealed sagger in a wood fired kiln just like you make wootz steel. So, I can make charcoal. I can do that. I can build a kiln from sand and clay. Where do I get the tools?Some tools I could make out of wood, but I would prefer metal. I don't have any metal. Perhaps a handaxe, or a stone chopper. I don't how to knap flint. I suppose I could learn it, but I'm told it's harder than it looks to get a good stone tool. Jesus, I've pushed my tech date back two million years, haven't I?Alright, so let's say I got my stone axes, and sicles, and blades, and knives, and I've cut wood, and carved tools, and dug clay and heaped sand, and my connections have provided me with ingots of bronze, and I'm ready to go, right?I need wax to shape for the lost wax process (which, thankfully, I know how to do using the Old Skool process still used in West Africa of dipping wax into a clay slurry and sprinkling with sand to make a stucco, dry, repeat, then fire out the wax). I currently use microcrystalline wax, which is a petroleum byproduct made by skimming off the solids from a vacuum distillation process. I got no petroleum. I got  no still. I got no engine to create a vacuum. I don't how to make any these, not easily. By trial and error, sure.Maybe instead, I should use bees wax. That I'm sure I can find. Probably got stung a lot, but...Okay now I'm set. Ready to melt metal and cast my piece. And all it took was a few years and either a lot of barter, or a lot of labor, probably far more labor than I had ever anticipated.Modern society rules."},
{"title": "An Observation Continued", "date": "Wednesday, June 12, 2013", "text": "My brother has a dog, a Boston terrier, which is, I'm sure, convinced that I'm a total idiot. It's His sole purpose in life is to have fun playing catch. When I show up, it he approaches with a ratty old tennis ball in it's his mouth, which I refuse to take the clue. It He gets more and more frustrated and insistent until I finally give in and throw the ball. What took me so long? Clearly, I'm an idiot.I'm sure cows must think the same thing. \"Milk me, you idiot\", they low to me. Similarly cats, chickens, pigeons, squirrels, and really almost any animal that has consistent contact with us must think that we are just as dumb as a box of rocks.My surmise is, if or when hyperintelligent synthetic brains or computers are developed/spontaneously emerge, we humans will consider them fucking stupid as hell, complete dolts, clueless morons.I'm sure the Roman plebes, the lower classes that worked for a living, must have felt the same towards the monied and propertied patricians. In the previous essay, on a revolt and secession of the laboring classes in Rome of the 5th century BCE, it was assumed that Gaius Menenius Agrippa's fable of the idle belly was about the patrician class. However, I have to ask the question if it was, or if the belly analogy was about the lower classes and an intestinal revolt?Reason I ask that is Gaius seems to have a rather enlightened, clear-eyed, almost apologetic attitude toward his upper class compatriots, the idle rich, far too modern a view. My suspicion is the fable is a realization, an admission that the lower classes apparently serve a purpose within Roman society. Reason I say that is at the time, the patricians would have considered themselves the truly important portion of Roman society. They were, after all, the main military force used for defense of the homeland and expansion of the frontiers (Rome at the time relied upon private militias, and a standing army was far in the future), the priesthood and sole arbiter with the gods (propitiation of the gods took up an inordinately large amount of time in Roman society, and the aristocracy held all priestly positions, all ceremonial and auguring duties rested solely with them), a hereditary clientele/patronage system existed with the aristocrats calling the shots (job creators), and, of course, all publicly held lands were administered by the Senate (and obviously to promote the general welfare, all for the public good, right?). All in all, the plebs, the lower classes, were but mere scenery, the stage and sets upon which the real actors, the aristocracy performed. Part of the background to be ignored, and an absurdity that they should rebel at all, as if the very trees and rocks picked up and left! So, it must have seen exceedingly large-hearted and progressive in the extreme for Gaius to recognize the lowly proles might actually in some lazy fashion contribute to society after all.At least that's my take, times being what they were.  Fast forward to the 17th century, and honestly, not much changed, did it? You still have the landed and monied class in a position of privilege, not really paying much attention to the sturdy yeoman farmers, laborers, and mechanics that naturally gave some form of support and sustainment to the Founding Fathers, granted, occasionally underfoot and annoyingly vocal, but useful, I suppose, in helping greater things to be accomplished. Say what you will about the efficacy of the Constitution, if is clearly a pre-industrial, medieval document written to assure and protect the rights and privileges of the American elites. Otherwise, why not support universal suffrage and egalitarianism - the voting rights of the property-less, the freeing of slaves, and granting of equal treatment to women and other undesirables? And that's all right there in the Constitution, right?And that would, in turn, explain the fork in the road this nation took in 1857, when the twin competing stimulus packages (and visions) stood before Congress, of America as a slave empire, or America as an absorber of cheap peoples to run machines. It could have gone to the former. The South, for the first half of the 19th century, held all the cards in an America whose chief export - at least until 1914 - was agricultural produce. We forget that some of the richest people on the planet were Southern planters with enormous capital in land, produce, and slaves.I've often wondered how that dark world would have played into the future, had the vision of slave empire come to pass. Would we as a nation still have a giant asshole on the twenty dollar bill? Or would he have moved up in denomination? I've no doubt America would be a banana republic, and certainly with a titled aristocracy. Would there now be foment and revolution and strife in our territories and dominions throughout the Western hemisphere? Or would that have happened in the 1920s? Or not all? Could it be that by now, as in Rome, some 40% of all American citizens would be slaves, with a market in nearly every town? Who can say? It's probably worth a book. But I can't see that world, despite all of our failings here, being better than our world. Of course, it was not meant to be. I've got to look to the Industrial Revolution for part of the change, although I've never bought into the economic argument that slavery was inefficient, considering modern statistics. I think the real kicker was the telegraph and the steam engine, which allowed modern bureaucracy and the corporate state.Ever seen the nerves in primitive animals like the squid giant axon? The nerves are that big because they are not insulated, the leak electricity down the message path. Along come the glial cells, almost like some aliens from another planet, and encase the stodgy nerves in an amazing support system. Interestingly, the glial cells in our nervous system out number neurons about ten to one, about the same as plebs to aristos in ancient Rome, or common citizens to Revolutionary aristocrats statesmen. I'd like to make that my number, Kurman's number, like Dunbar's number, were it not so far off from present day's number of, what, 99 to 1?"},

This is not to say that the Roman republic had it's periods of suppression and despotism (and by modern standards, the whole of it's history was one long sordid affair).Nevertheless, the trend in Rome, for a time, was increased democratization and the promotion of egalitarian sympathies.Sometime in perhaps the fifth century BCE, a remarkable speech was given by a certain Gaius Menenius Agrippa, a member of the aristocracy, though of moderate views, and the speech went like this:\"Once upon a time, the members of the human body did not agree together,as they do now, but each had its own thoughts and words to express itself. All the various parts resented the fact that they should have the worry and trouble and sheer hard work of providing everything for the belly, which remained idly among them, with nothing to do except enjoy the pleasant things they gave it. The discontented members plotted together that the hand should carry no food to the mouth, that the mouth should accept nothing that was offered it and the teeth should refuse to chew anything. Because of their anger they tried to subdue the belly by starvation only to find that they all and the entire body wasted away. From this it was that clear that the belly did indeed have a useful purpose to perform. Yes, it receives food, but, by the same token, it nourishes other members and gives back to every part of the body, through its veins, the blood it made by the process of digestion. On this blood we live and thrive\".Now, what is this fable about? Is Gaius referring to the idle rich as the belly? Or the poor?To put it in context, the republic had suffered a series of military setbacks that resulted in economic stagnation. The lower classes and laborers - the farmers and artisans, peasants, the poor and disadvantaged, suffering under crushing debt and other restrictions imposed upon them by the aristocrats, boycotted Rome. They literally abandoned the city, offering no violence or provocations, they went on strike, and left the upper classes to their own devices.So, within the context, it is clearly the ruling elite that is the soft belly of Rome.Would that speech be interpreted differently today, here in America, where the cultivated attitude towards the poor would seem to suggest that they sit idly by, living off of government largesse? And if so, how would this fable be received today?"},

{"title": "Mechanicules and Machinerettes", "date": "Wednesday, June 5, 2013", "text": "This essay might skirt dangerously close to an artist's statement. Within the fictional construction/rationalization of creating all these little critters was the idea that they acted together as a community or consortium that in turn created a metabolism or quasi-stable non-equilibrial flux control system that allows fantasy machines to survive and thrive. Not having any expertise in biology or systems thinking or graph theory or networks pretty much guarantees that I will be fascinated by all that - but without having to do any of the heavy lifting. However, I do note that the trends in thinking about technology are shifting towards the worldview of living systems (see Kevin Kelly's thoughts about The Technium, or the fact that industry trend journals now regularly speak of technological ecosystems). This makes sense as 1) technology is created by living systems, and 2) once tools get sophisticated enough, they enter the realm of behaviors inhabited by living systems. (I've talked about this before. Want to see what the Technological Singularity looks like? Study microbiology).So, when I thought of making these little suckers, it was always in the sense of a community of things rather than individuals. And source topics would have to be the gut and its inhabitants (our Second Brain), or the neurovascular system of our brain and (all those weird - almost alien - glial cells that suffuse/support/supplement those stodgy neurons of ours). And it was always in the sense of a community of things that think (not individually, but collectively). So what are they thinking about, and what are they doing? I DON'T KNOW!So, when I was making each of these things, either unconsciously, consciously but unwittingly, or wittingly but unintentionally, I was thinking of them as a group. And it kind of shows, what with each having either a tentacle or a grabber, or a handle of some type, or some way for them to be embedded together. And perhaps that's where I should go with them, just make a shitload and pile together in some kind of techno-biolfilm, a siliceous/mucilaginous layer of commensal sophistication.Ooh. Eek! But still, not really all creepy, right? Or is it? maybe I'm unconsciously making plastic gyre trash.In any case, that's probably what I should end up doing with the cast glass prepared slides. The bronzes seem to be trophies, stand alone dead representations of the mechanical creatures, but the cast glass slides, I'm thinking now, should be in vitro/vivo/situ community snapshots. Messy. Colorful. Alive. Populated.Refractory mold waiting for the glassYeah, that's the ticket."},
{"title": "Post-Mortem", "date": "Tuesday, June 4, 2013", "text": "I've talked about Bose-Einstein condensates before, and actually, kind of salivated over them, thinking that some Next Big Thing will result from them. And I think I've mentioned fermionic condensates as well. But I'd have to google myself on that topic, and I just don't have the time. So, at the risk of repeating myself, I think fermionic condensates might be big shit as well. (And fermionic condensates (FCs) would be like a degenerate electron gas, supercooled and paired up to behave themselves, but they can't unify the way a BEC does due to the Pauli exclusion principle. With me? Good).Well, it occurs to be that, as long as you have your electrons all stacked in the available energy states, as in a supercooled example, then you get your FC. Of course, what's really required is that the electrons be stacked relative to each other. In other words, they don't need to be supercooled temperature-wise, they just have to be supercooled relative to each other's energy states. And, in fact, there is now a way to do that with tunable short-pulse beam of electrons that are moving at close to the speed of light. These \"cool\" relativistic beams of ultrashort pulses, done with a fucking really nice tight tuning mechanism, should produce relativistic fermionic condensates. And that, dearies, should make for some really awesome applications, like superconducting charges without the materials, I'm guessing. But then, if I thought of it, I sure others much, much smarter have as well. Stellar tectonics, anyone?Okay, okay, time to cover my Kickstarter post-mortem. It was a success, but also a failure. It was failure in the sense that kickstarter is about strangers giving you monies for your project. That didn't happen with me. Friends, family, and acquaintances made up the vast majority of contributors. So, it was my failure to adequately plan out the campaign. Not that I didn't read up and do research. We Kurmans are notorious for advance preparation when it comes to a new endeavor that interests us. Why, I've known my brother to practically put in expert hours (10,000 plus) in book-learning prior to tackling a new thing that he gets hooked on. Almost overnight. I kind of do the same thing, but I notice I have a particular blind-spot. I will do all of the research, examining and planning for all of the aspects, drilling down on every facet, covering every base - except one. And in that sub-category, I will make a beginner's mistake. Quite simply because, well, I don't know. What I do know is it must have something to do with my fascination in overall systems thinking and analysis, but not quite being fascinated with one boring detail.So, in the kickstarter project, I think I did well on prepping the material rewards, not so well on presentation and marketing my target group.Bill Hicks on Marketing:You would think, as an artist, and having said many times that presentation is 90% of the whole deal, that I would have spent more time on polishing the videos. But honestly, I just wanted to get past that, and get the product vision out there. I could have done a much better job, but felt that, given pretty much everyone and his uncle is now kickstarter, that I better get something out NOW.And I really, really didn't do a good job on identifying my demographic. What is my demographic? Well, the creepy-crawlie/Charles Adams/Edward Gorey/H.R. Giger/maybe-kinda Carlos Huante fan base out there. Instead, I had people telling me they liked my steampunk robot animals.Steampunk? WTF? Well, steampunkish, in the sense that I used bronze, mistaken as brass, but honestly, do you see any goggles, any 19th-century design, any zeppelins and high-pressure steam engine shit in these things? I don't. And maybe that's my blind spot. But I'm going for the ultra-violet biomechanical crowd, the mutant metal creepy crawlie crowd, the Prometheus crowd.Steam powered?Degenerate fermionic condensate, Cooper-paired neutron fusion, matter/antimatter powered, bitches! With cigarettes and booze!Okay, so, given that the Intertubes today are powered by photos, I really screwed the pooch by not targeting the tumblers, snapchats, and twits. I did do a half-hearted tweet campaign, but I just couldn't go fishing for those paramecia. ( Speaking of which, there were some nasty and infantile comments on reddit, and to be honest, twenty years ago I'd have engaged in a two-week-long flamewar with those losers, but, uh, fuck 'em. I notice it's becoming easier and easier to ignore over-priveleged, pretentiously pompous, pampered, undertalented, simpering little buttholes and not react to them).And as far as social networks are concerned, my anecdotal experience is that the facebook and google+ and living social and all the rest aren't quite the Kevin Bacon dissipators we are all led to beleive. My guess is, I got to two degree of separation before the whole message drowned in noise.My thoughts, anyway. And unlikely it is I will do another campaign, maybe not much an analysis.Oh, yeah, pictures of machinerettes (which are little versions of mechanicules):In Color......and in Black and White"},

{"title": "Charity", "date": "Friday, May 24, 2013", "text": "Note: I've been down in SW Florida the past weekend for a long weekend, a trip that has been in the planning for about six months. I got the requisite sun- and alcohol- poisoning out of the way fairly early, and was doing pretty well down there in laid back parrot-head land, until I ran afowl of the lawn chair. Keep in mind, I regularly will heft and toss fifty pound bags of ceramic powders and clay up onto shelves with the ease of a basketball free throw, no problem. But, dehydration, alcohol, and a less than mindful thought process combined to antagonize an old back injury when I lifted up a five pound lawn chair and I suddenly could not stand up straight. The remainder of the night was pain so intense I was nauseous. Fortunately, some Vicodin and muscle relaxants took care of all that, but I've been down for the count lo these past few days. As a result, I'm behind on my Kickstarter begging duties, and so you get the following:   Being raised as an American, being fed the standard ethos of rugged individualism, stand-on-your-own-two-feetism, pull-yourself-up-by-your-own-bootstraps-ism, it is difficult for me to ask for help. Asking for help, asking for assistance, is, at different levels, considered shameful, even sinful, here in this country.This is an irony that ignores reality, considering that it is impossible for any one of us individuals, at any point in history, to not be thoroughly dependent upon other individuals for our very existence. Why, even Robinson Crusoe had a prior dependence upon people before struggling on his own on a desert island.So, I really should get over these primitive instincts. Pride being, of course, the primary primitive atavism at work here. I thought I made good progress in tamping down my pride and cultivating a healthy humility by setting up a Kickstarter project and asking for help. And of course, the beautiful thing about this is that humility in turn can be transformed into pride in my fellow human beings. The paradox is that humility, in making me small and humble, makes me, in turn, enlarged through the generosity of others. To see such a largeness of spirit and open-armed generosity is deeply affecting, and makes me feel great in turn. And the one small price I have to pay for it, really, is some small amount of alchemy, some craft and effort and shaping of things, to provide my backers with a little piece of (hopefully) magical piece of the material universe. True, it may seem like a trade bead or a trinket to others, but it contains as much benevolence and obliging congeniality as I can suffuse into it.To those who have helped me, much obliged. And so now I'm asking for just a little bit more help, and a chance for all you strangers out there to embiggen yourselves a bit more.This is the final week of the (ah-ha-ha, now I know how public TV feels) pledge drive for my project. I'm very close, currently 72% funded, for the project. All I need is a few more contributors, and then, it shall be my turn to be generous. And, believe me, I will not disappoint."},
{"title": "The Arithmetic of Interstellar Travel", "date": "Wednesday, May 15, 2013", "text": "I've a new Kickstart update with a video: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1123543349/mechanicules/posts.I apologize for the crudeness of the video. I really am considering digging up Steve Jobs and throttling him. Imovie files are not compatible with Kicstarter. So, I had to convert to quicktime, and then it was too big. So I had to cut scenes, and narrate on the fly, and the result is, well, probably not even a middle school level film production. But you'll get the idea.Other things. John Quiggin pokes fun at interstellar travel with some easy calculations. I'd make comments questioning some of his assumptions there, but then, what would be the point? I'll do it here instead.\"I'm going to assume (generously, I think) that the minimum size for a successful colony is 10 000. The only experience we have is the Apollo program, which transported 12 astronauts to the Moon (a distance of 1 light second) at a cost of $100 billion or so (current values). So, assuming linear scaling (again, very generously, given the need to accelerate to near lightspeed), that's a cost of around $100 trillion per light-second for 10 000 people. 1200 light-years is around 30 billion light-seconds, so the total cost comes out roughly equal to the value of current world GDP accumulated over the life of the universe.\"So, what's wrong with the assumptions? Well, first off, Quiggin uses the Apollo program. No offense to America's space program, but come on, that was a stunt.Don't get me wrong, I'm not disparaging the effort. It was the most spectacular and magnificent stunt ever, defining our species as the only known species to travel to another world, but still, finally just a stunt. And by that I mean, pretty much guaranteed to be a one-time deal, with a vast gamble that the odds could be beaten, with lots of corners cut (but leave that to the real experts, the Soviets), and a certain amount of acceptable risk on the part of the world's greatest stuntmen ever and their organization. But, a colonizing effort? Hardly.What would be a better baseline comparison? I'm thinking totaling up the entire web-of-technology system cost of what it takes for one car in 2013 to drive from New York City to Los Angeles. So, right off the bat, the cost of the car, the cost of gas, cost of the trip (food, water, lodging) is the tiniest portion of this total cost. Got the idea? We should probably also include cost of the interstate system, cost of the infrastructure to gas up the gas stations, supply food to the hotels and restaurants, electricity, fresh water, factories that built the car, refineries that makes the gas, riggers that pump the oil, etc. etc. etc.Well, fuck man, isn't that the cost of Western civilization going back to some arbitrary point? Or world civilization going back to at least the origins of agriculture?Yup. But, you know, amortized.So, is Quiggin's total cost too low? By a huge margin!Let's take a different tack. How about the United States colonizing the Moon with 10,000 by 1978? What do you think? 24 men launched to the Moon, so the Apollo costs by a factor of 416, the do the Quiggin arithmetic?Ah-HA-ha-ha-ha-ha!"},
{"title": "The Dying Earth", "date": "Monday, May 13, 2013", "text": "Sad news. A friend of mine at the college has cancer. Stage 4 in both lungs, and it's spread to the brain. They give him, if everything works out, three years. I don't see that happening. I've just heard the news, and I've yet to talk to him. I have no idea what to say. When people hear that someone has cancer, it's like you've told them he or she is received a death sentence. They are already dead. I can't do that. Call me foolish, but I refuse to give up on people.My weekend boss, the sculptor, took a bad fall last week. He was visiting, in a strange house, and got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. There were two doors, one going to the bathroom, and the other to the basement. He got the wrong door and took a header down the stairs. I've heard limited information on his condition, but his wife said he is in for a \"long recovery\" which suggests some major head injury. I've made my best wishes known and offered any help.Iain M. Banks has cancer. I read his novel The Algebraist some years back and enjoyed it (not everyone did), but had not been exposed to the Culture. It is a pity that, having just discovered these wonderful books, the source may not be with us much longer. Of Banks I will say that it is hard to find such vibrant prose, occasionally touched with poesy, that contain so many \"fucks\" in it.On the not so sad news front, Jack Vance is still alive. Wow. Ninety-six years old. For those of you who do not him, Jack Vance is considered the Grandmaster of Fantasy and Science Fiction. His prose is elegantly constructed and intricately contrived, without being overly complicated or forced. Reading his books in my teens expanded my vocabulary. To this day, the tone and mood of his Dying Earth stories still haunt me.In one story, a character named Cugel the Clever is internally afflicted with an alien creature named Firx by Iucounu The Laughing Magician. Firx is some type of parasitic life form from a world orbiting the star Achernar. I've my own vision of what this creature looked like, and here it is:   Ah, but of course, bigger. I've kept busy making more critters.Honestly, I don't think I'd like to be internally afflicted by any of these things, but their small, so it would take a lot of them to be noticeable.I suppose I should do an update on kickstarter. Currently, I'm at 40% of funding with 18 days to go. My student aide posted a notice on reddit, to which I inquired \"Isn't that where all the assholes are?\"\"Yes, but it's exposure\".\"Ick. I don't want that kind of crowd.\" Too late, and so what. A nonevent anyway.So, I'm trying to get together a \"making of\" video to post as an update to kickstarter. We'll see how that goes."},
{"title": "Mogadishu on the Mississippii", "date": "Friday, May 10, 2013", "text": "I'm a big fan of Eris, the Greek goddess of chaos, strife, and discord. I've come to think that what we call Greek tragedies, the Greeks found funny as hell - kind of like how Hieronymus Bosch's fascinatingly macabre and horrendous paintings were the Dilbert cartoons of his age. You know, like Oedipus at Colonus, how he kills his dad, fucks his mom, and puts his eyes out. Got to be funny as hell to them back in that barbaric age, not so funny now. Something lost through time, I suspect, but the irony implicit in the chorus' repetition that \"not to be born is best\" is still extant.And so you got Eris, whom I would describe as the arbiter of unintended consequences, the modern-day version of chaos, strife, and discord.Take two instances. The first is the gun printer's website (which gets enough buzz as it is, so I'll not mention it here) and the please-arrest-me-so-I-can-set-a-legal-precedent in-your-face stance they take. (Ironically also reinforcing-statist-controls-by-affirming-through-legal-means-that-the-government-insures-your-rights by winning any legal precedent). Their big deal is Thingaverse prohibits gunprinting. On the other hand, their website is part of the Freedumb movement and is liberty incarnate (their version, the only real version), and will thus accept any and all designs without prejudice.Freedumb!Fine. Take advantage of this offer. Flood their site, in kind of a denial-of-service spime attack, with every cute-sie knick-knack, tschotske, bric-a-brac, fandangle, curio, thingamajig, curio, precious moment, hello kitty design artifact that you can think of. Better still, let some hijacked computers think of it. They say they will deny nothing. Take it over the top. See how they like freedumb.Secondly, the Misery Missouri state legislature has passed a bill to counteract federal gun laws. They've sent the bill to the governor to sign into law. I say go for it! I especially like this part:\"The Kansas legislation would prohibit federal regulation of guns that are manufactured and remain in the state. It would also criminalize the enforcement of federal gun-control laws\"Missouri, don't let Kansas show you up! I'm pretty sure federal gun-control laws include the prohibitions on automatic weaponry and military munitions like flamethrowers, rocket-propelled grenades, things like that. So, I say, entrepreneurs, set up shop in Missouri and start cranking those domestic machine guns and RPGs, and by all means, make them freely available to all. No restrictions.  I really, seriously want to see the big round O on the legislators faces when motorcycle gangs with AK-47s get the insurgency going full on. With any luck, maybe a few of the windows in their gated communities might shot out. Maybe one of their babies' heads struck with a stray armor-piercing round from a mile away. Maybe their stretch limo gets hit with a proudly-locally-made M40 grenade.One can at least hope."},
{"title": "Semi-Random Walk", "date": "Wednesday, May 8, 2013", "text": "I toccurs to me that I've never actually done a random walk essay. I wonder if is even possible to do one, as the mathematician Gregory Chaitin once pointed out, randomness is defined by what it is not, and if a pattern is found, it ain't random. So, how about semi-random, or pseudorandom topics?It's a rare thing for me to be home watching prime time TV, but I felt I needed a little break from my 7-days-a-week-12-hours-a-day work schedule, and so I went home and ran, and then had a decent dinner for a change, and then watched TV. The run, by the way, took place in gorgeous weather, and so everyone was out running. This made me realize I have reached the \"morning-staff-sergeant\" stage of my running career. (Not quite sure how it played out in the movie, but one of the opening scenes in the movie Battle Los Angeles shows Marine staff sergeant Aaron Eckhart running along the beach, trying to stay in shape, and has six of his men easily pass him by, each shouting \"Morning, Staff Sergeant!\").In any case, I watched PBS and they had a new show with Peter Sagal called Constitution USA. Peter Sagal is the host of a radio show that wants to be funny called \"Wait Wait Don't Tell Me\".  In keeping with breezy, cheerful, lightweight personality of the host, this is a fluff piece. Only softball questions have been lobbed so far. It's the first hour of a four hour series, and so perhaps something more hard hitting and insightful will be presented, but it just looks like cheerleading for the good 'ol USA, so, pass. I'll not find out if it gets any better. Speaking of insightful, I read a fairly lucid opinion piece about Bitcoin over at Wired magazine by hacker-entrepreneur Dan Kaminsky that is worth reading. I say fairly lucid because I don't agree entirely with his opinions. I do agree that bitcoin is like gold, but Dan mistakes gold for money. Bitcoin, like gold, is a commodity, but it's not currency. \"But bitcoin is a medium of transfer\", you object, \"so it must be money\". Well, dearie, shells, beads, and wampum are also media of transfer, but that doesn't make them money. That makes them, like gold, and bitcoin, commodities. The valuation of commodities is in the amount of TOIL, labor and energy, both physical and mental, human ingenuity that goes into producing things and making them available. TOIL is money. Money is toil, or the promise of future toil. Period.I also disagree that bitcoin is better than gold. Dan says that gold doesn't have a teleporter like bitcoin. And by teleport, he means \"we can just poke in a few coordinates and poof, off it goes, with the ease of posting to some forum somewhere\". Well, call me ignorant, I fail to see the difference between this and electronic transfer, which you can certainly do with gold, unless Dan thinks they actually move the stuff around for those massive transactions. Or that gold futures, or any commodity future, is stuff that will be moved around.Surprising that, because Dan understands that all currency is fiat currency. As he says, \"Fighting over what’s “fiat” and what’s “real” is silly. It’s all fiat. Gold isn’t conscious; all value is belief\". There you go. Belief in what? Well, each other, faith in the productive capacities and continued appetites of our fellow self-replicating robots. Another word for faith or belief is Debt, which is, dearies, paradoxically far more solid than gold. Gold is the merest zephyr in a vacuum compared to Debt (so long as you don't overleverage). If you don't get that, I doubt you've made it out of Piaget's Concrete Operational Stage of Cognitive Development. Which pretty much makes you an Ayn Rand fan. Speaking of utopian world views awaiting the long slide towards universal disparagement and self-parody, the Singularity is back, both here, and here. The Singularity, or as Ken Macleod once called it \"The Rapture for Nerds\", is one of those things that I've talked about before. I do view the irrational optimism expressed towards it with a jaundiced eye, the same way I view medical nanorobots in my bloodstream - I can't see how it can turn out well, or at least without avoiding a few microstrokes and some gangrene of the extremities. My views evolve on it: yea or nay, if or when, and if it happens intentional or accidental. But I always maintain that I am right that if it does occur, ALL BETS ARE OFF! But, um, just aping neural nets and hoping something comes out of it seems to have some promise.Rather than continue, here's my comment from another discussion:First off, my bet is, if (IF) it does come, it won't be won't be what you expect. The one theme ever since Vinge introduced the term is All Bets Are Off. In other words, us talking about it, trending and projecting, is just indelicate public wanking. My second bet is, it doesn't come, or rather, it comes in a series of increasingly frequent Narrow Catastrophes, such as when dumb AIs caused the Flash Crash. Third bet is, it's overrated, just like all visions of the future. Fourth bet, it's already here. Fifth bet, which is more of a quibble, the only self-replicating intelligent robots I see are us, and that gets us back to the third bet. Sixth bet, which really is a quibble, is that we've been through at least five singularities. 1) The Big Bang, 2) Organic Life on Earth, 3) RNA world to DNA world and the rise of the bacterial consortia, 4) the Eukaryotic Revolution, and 6) Multicellular Life. The fact that massively plenitudinous parallelism took at least 13.7 billion years to get us here makes me think the Big S is not around the corner. Smart as we are, we are not as smart as we fucking think we are.Lastly, just so you know I have an overzealous enthusiasm of my own (RE: the practical applications of the ultracold and perhaps the use of Bose-Einstein condensates for something really fucking cool), someone has come up with the atom chip on a stick. Portable! Neat!"},

I say that because of the line of shit he and his have been handing out during the NRA convention down in Houston.Separated at birth?Why do I say it is a line of shit? Because, dearies, a national gun registry already exists.It's called your customer history, and the massive amount of data contained within the Retail Industrial Complex has the goods on all you red-blooded American consumers. Worst of all, you volunteered it all, dumbasses.

If the government wants to, your assets can be frozen, credit history destroyed, police records created or tampered with, unsavory stories made up about you, and really that's a government that is not particularly all that well organized, and so relies quite on private enterprise (when private enterprise knows everything about you already, and all a particular governmental agency need do is pay them for, or officially request, information)?Because, let's face it, dearies, you have been thoroughly milked, udders tugged dry, of every bit of personal information you possess by the credit agencies, banks, retail establishments, you name it.\"Ah, well, wait!\" you say. \"Gun shows!\" True, most weapons obtained by criminals are purchased at gun shows, and most weapons there are paid for with cash or barter. But think on that. Would these be the gun shows that are regular and recurrent events, promoted, well-advertised, with the same licensed retail and unlicensed vendors appearing there almost every single time? Would these be the gun shows where you buy not only guns, but all the useless ancillary merchandise that orbits the purchase of firearms?

This section - filled with cheap, shoddy, mostly secondhand and easily replaceable furnishings - was housed in 4 inch thick bulletproof plexiglass, and had a pass-thru security door for delivering drinks from the bar.As Sam, owner of Sam's Pub, put it to me: \"You want to drink here? Then you're staying in there with all your giant fucking furry goddamn octopus monsters and that giant fucking robot of yours!\"\"He's.. he's not mine\" I protested weakly. He was referring to Edward Hopper, the twelve-foot-tall anthropomorphic living machine representative of The Empire of Texas, who, after above mentioned incident, had made himself scarce, no doubt licking his wounds.\"You're all gonna fucking stay in there away from my regulars, where they can be safe and that's that!\"A kraken had already drawn a cartoon penis-shaped doodle into the impenetrable plexiglass while we were talking.  This is what comes from one billion years crafting and honing a sense of humor.And so it is with the Kraken, hard to take anything they say seriously, seeing as it might just be a whimsy wrapped in a jest hidden inside a prank. Still, the one across from me, sipping on an ale through a krazy loopy straw and idly scratching sawdust into the air with its talons, seemed serious enough.The kraken eyed me, mulling my comment, then said, \"Probably close enough\".\"Okay, I sigh, \"I give. Who are the Phobogians?\"\"Not whom, but what. The Phobogians was the legal entity in charge of Refreshments for the Illustrious Jubilation, and they were, in fact located, in Permian Gondwana proximate to what has since been named Armenia, so, again, probably close enough\".\"Alright, wait. The Permian? 250 million years ago Permian?\"\"Yes\".\"Bullshit\".\"Gorgon shit. That's what they would have said. Actually they didn't speak. They were olfactory mediated telepaths, so it would have been... spiral/spiral/penis-doodle\".\"...Okay. Who is they?\" I asked, trying sarcastically mimic the archness of the word.\"Hey, how ya doin'?\"The first sapient species on your planet, if you don't count the Vaster-Than-Empires-And-More-Slow global bacterial mat. Bipedal. Basically kangaroo rat-dogs. Closest relation in the fossil record would be Theriognathus microps. Killed themselves off in the late Changsingian Age of the latest Permian\".\"That would be the Permian Extinction?\"\"Just so\".\"The Great Dying?\"\"I was told yours was a touch faster than most ape brains. Perhaps I was misinformed\".\"Ha. ha. They were sapient? Like us? Had technology? Successful eusocial species? Where are the fossils? And how do you know about them? You said you hadn't visited Earth until a few million years ago\".\"You, a trained peranoscopist, should know better than to ask that last question\".Well, he had me there. A proper viewing of anything through a peranoscope is a proper viewing of everything, regardless of where or when it is/was. Still, I'm having a problem with that kraken sense of humor. It may be pulling my leg, and I'm stifling the cringe of anticipation when that runny snot cloud that is their substitute for laughter hits me in the face once the kraken figures I've fallen for its tall tale. But I'm getting nothing but earnestness and solemnity from the thing. It waggles the end of a tentacular limb for another beer.\"Eusocial. Technologically advanced, but not in the way you think. They were manipulators of life. Other creatures were their tools. Individually, not very bright, but in sufficient numbers, quite formidable intellects. And they numbered in the tens of billions. Witness their control of plate tectonics. The Siberian Traps? Magma upwellings? Mantel hotspots? Their idea.\"\"Wait. Fossils. You said there tens of billions-\"\"I need to explain the fossil record? Can I help it if you people are poor diggers?\"I shrugged, and forged ahead. \"So, what is this about the Illustrious Jubilation?\"\"You'll be wanting to get that beer that's up for me\".I went to the bar and got his ale, turned and looked very closely at his posture, the glint of the eyes, the disposition of the limbs, the timing and writhing of the vagina dentata lips. This was one sincere kraken. All signs said he was being honest with me.\"The kangaroo rat-dogs were artists on a planetary scale. They little else to do, having satisfied all of their material wants and needs. The Bogosians had been contracted to supply refreshments for the big celebration marking the completion of their  most ambitious art form to date - the volcano choreography known to you as the Siberian Traps. Ice was required for drinks. Gigatons of it. As you may or may not know, the only ice available was methane hydrates, buried off the coasts of Gondwana. Methane ice, by the way, the kangaroo rat-dogs found delicious in a way you couldn't appreciate. So, I don't know something went pear-shaped, and all of the ice got loose. Next thing you know, hazy green skies, purple bacteria pumping hydrogen sulfide, carbon cycle shut down, Strangelove oceans, runaway greenhouse. Get the picture?\"\"Yeah I get, a delivery problem. Always comes down logistics\".The kraken raised his glass in recognition.\"So, one last question. Weren't they our indirect mammalian ancestors? How come we aren't.. olfactory mediated telepaths?\"\"Quite simple. You haven't the nose hairs for it!\""},

{"title": "Rat Finks - or - How the West Was Really Won", "date": "Friday, April 26, 2013", "text": "In a game of repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, you will find that the best strategy is called \"Win-Stay, Lose-Shift\". Oh, you are familiar with the Prisoner's Dilemma game, correct? It's a non-zero sum game. You and your partner in crime are being separately interrogated by the cops. You have two options: keep quiet, or rat out your partner. Your partner has the same options. If both keep quiet, you might do some time, or the charges might be dropped. If you rat your partner, and she keeps quiet, you walk and she rots in jail. If you keep quiet and your partner rats, she walks and you rot. If you both rat, you both rot. Simple, huh?What gets interesting is when you repeat the play, in which case four strategies are evident.1) Always cooperate (keep quiet)2) Always defect (rat fink)3) Tit for tat (Do unto your partner what they last done to you)4) Win-stay, Lose-shift (cooperate when not ratted out, rat fink when ratted).All very rational, correct? (Well, actually, there is one other strategy called Generous Tit for Tat, but that's not rational). Now expand it to a general population, and you end up with an interesting game in evolution. And what you find is there is, over time, no one good static solution. The population dynamics will shift from mostly cooperators, to mostly rat finks, and back and forth, but with an interesting overall Pareto distribution over time of a population of around 80% normal people and 20% assholes. I suppose, out in the real world, the temptation would be to just eliminate the assholes.Problem is, the assholes are not the problem. It's the evolutionary niche that favors assholes that is the problem. So, how to minimize the size of that particular basin of attraction in this game of chaos theory? Well, borrowing from Sherlock Holmes, you have three avenues of attack: motive, means, and opportunity. Traditionally, government is used to limit opportunity and means. Situational parameters tend to randomize the motive, although I suppose there is some segment of the population who are just always going to be psychotic pricks about things. Which leads me to my review of Anne F. Hyde's book \"Empires, Nations, and Families\".Short review? I liked it. Longer review? I believe she provides insights on two levels. One is, well, fairly obvious to anyone who can get past Piaget's Concrete Operations Stage (which pretty much rules out Conservatives and Libertarians), which is, that there's a very special place in Hell waiting for the United States of America. Anne is a bit more generous, merely qualifying certain decades as times when citizens of the United States can be portrayed as \"particularly nasty\".The second level of the book is to stake down and skin that old bullshit myth about how the west was won by white people entering an empty landscape and claiming it as their own by dint of hard work and strong character. (Yeah, and lots of government assistance). She does a very good job of populating the West (from 1800 to 1860) with the people that actually lived there, a mixed bag of characters, families plying ancient trade networks. We tend to forget that the whole point of business was the fur trade, a huge money maker at the time.Let me digress for a brief moment to talk about one major delusion on the part of libertarians, that limited government and a free market would create paradise on earth for all involved. Witness the Pacific Northwest.In 1818 the United States and Great Britain agreed to a “joint occupancy” of the Pacific Northwest between the 42nd and 54th parallels. Joint occupancy meant that neither nation would have a government presence there, but that “the vessels, citizens, and subjects” from both nations could do business and settle there. The British took the first gamble in occupying the region, establishing Fort Vancouver north of the Columbia River. Governor George Simpson, of the Hudson’s Bay Company, good capitalist that he was, decided to strip the region of furs. The Hudson’s Bay Company quickly created a “fur desert” all the way back east to the Rockies to discourage American fur trappers.Eventually, American settlers moved into the Oregon Territory, often, due to poor planning and lack of foresight, starving, and destitute. John Mcloughlin chief factor of Fort Vancouver, offered the American settlers food and supplies on credit.“This policy, overly generous as it was from the perspective of the Hudson’s Bay Company, still created resentment among the immigrants. Many of the arrivals had been saved from starvation by free supplies given to them by the U.S. Army  at various forts along the Oregon Trail, and now they couldn’t understand why the Hudson’s Bay Company posts, which was, of course, British and private, would ask them to pay money for food in their time of need. Even the policy of extending credit led to the reputation of the Hudson’s Bay Company as being anti-American and tight-fisted, although the Company wasn’t doing anything that American merchants wouldn’t have done, or did do, to their own countrymen in Oregon”. p.141 Empires, Nations, and Families by Anne F. Hyde.The point here? Mostly irony heaped upon irony. But onward...In 1783, with the Treaty of Paris, Britain ceded all claims as far west as the Mississippi River. Why such a generous concession was made is still something of a mystery to me, and I need to look into that. I think it helps to look at a map of the North American continent in 1783. The Tsar of all the Russias claims Alaska and the Pacific Coast as far south as Vancouver Island. The Pacific Northwest and Canada as far east as the current province of Alberta is up for grabs. South of this, the Empire of Spain lays claim to all lands of the current lower 48 east to the Mississippi. Britain holds Canada, and a pipsqueak upstart of a nation called the United States clings to the Atlantic coast. Five million Anglo-Americans operate under a soon-to-fail-miserably-Libertarian experiment called the Articles of Confederation. In control of the interior continent are nations such as the Iroquois, Ottawa, Fox, Delaware, Miami, Shawnee, Cherokee, Chikasaw, Wichita, Comanche, Apache, Sioux, Cheyenne, Blackfoot, and Ute.  Anyone who wishes to engage in the highly lucrative fur trade within the continent would best serve themselves to look at the existing trade relations of Spanish and French traders - who have been metabolized by the Indians through intermarriage, family, mixed-blood relatives, networks of long established mutual trust and good fellowship. Some few Anglo-Americans understand this, and join this centuries old system. The problem is the new version of capitalism that has recently emerged with the advent of the Industrial Revolution, and the modifications of moral and ethical systems this entails. \"native nations faced their biggest challenges in the border zones where trade brought people together and where Anglo-American settlement happened most quickly. The U. S. government, such as it was, had no control over the process of settlement or the operation of trade. The problem of white squatters and their conception of ownership of land led to chaos - chaos that government agents chose to ignore, because, in the end, the most human bureaucracies of the United States believed in white settlement at any cost.\" In short, in an unregulated business environment, business regulates government. Anyone who chooses to see this as a good thing clearly has not paid any attention whatsoever to world history. I would identify these types of people as either willfully ignorant or dangerously stupid, but entirely able to brush aside the empirical evidence of human history.Anyone who has spent any time looking at trade recognizes that it is always subject to boundary conditions. Trade exists at the frontiers of established regions - not just geographic, but informational, cultural, what have you, as well. And where boundaries exist, boundary conditions can fluctuate, and thus all the more reason to regulate those conditions to avoid catastrophe. Case in point: With the Trade and Intercourse Acts of 1822, Congress gets government out of the fur trade. Congress abolished the factor system of trading posts, and instead instituted local agents to deal with individual tribes and regions. The logic in abolishing the “factory” system was to open up the fur trade to more people, allowing market competition to regulate prices for furs and Indian trade goods. The results proved disastrous for everyone involved. Congress assumed that frontier regions had a much larger governmental presence than existed, and that all participants would practice under a rule of law. This policy of self-policing worked about as well as you would expect. Well-regulated and established flows of prohibited goods, such as liquor and guns, soon became chaotic with a larger number of players increasing tensions. In addition, Natives used to receiving quality goods from Europe (such as Italian glass trade beads, Chinese silk, British tower muskets, soft, strong wool yarn and vermillion from England) were now offered shoddy American goods. Natives had no reason to trade furs, which irritated some Anglo-American traders, resulting in increase in theft and trade by force. Centuries of trade was replaced by decades of war. Now, a fair question to ask is, was this a result of lack of regulation or the recent arrival of the Anglo-American version of capitalism? Or was this merely a reflection of the fundamental viciousness hard-eyed business pragmatism of the collective American character? Regardless, we are aware of the consequences - whether it’s through the stain of chattel slavery imposed upon our African cousins (and some few indentured Europeans), or the genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out upon the indigenous populations, we as a nation, like Marley’s ghost, have forged a very long chain of sin indeed. If we are to blame the American character, we must look to Britain. But that can’t be it, because they drink tea and watch Dr. Who. So it must then it must be the industrial version of capitalism. Anne F. Hyde places the sea change at 1864. I can understand why. That’s the year the United States turned pro, with a modern system of governance, and an established official plan of Manifest Destiny.I say it was 1857 when things shifted. The natives still had fighting chance up until then, but afterwards they didn't stand a chance. There were two competing two visions back East that played out on the Kansas plains: the slave empire versus the machines subsidized land and cheap imported people to work them. Underneath all that was :“hunter versus settler, trade and negotiation versus cash on the barrelhead, shared space versus exclusive rights, racial mixing and family formation versus white supremacy”. We all know how that turned out."},
{"title": "Amish Poopsicles", "date": "Monday, April 22, 2013", "text": "Mother Jones has a good layperson's article on the role of gut bacteria in weight loss and healthy living. More than just human health here, human existence when it comes to the gut.I'm rather pleased that I was born and raised when and where I was. Lots and lots of dirt and germs for me to be exposed to from birth onwards. Being raised in the country, or what passed for it, I never had the icky reflex when it came to Nature. And, although I have a sweet tooth, I've never liked soft drinks and have will always eat my vegetables. ( I actually don't consider dinner dinner unless there's a vegetable dish or two). I've inadvertently been keeping my gut bacteria happy, for the most part. No wonder I enjoy such good health.A couple of things of note that caught my eye in the article. This quote here:\"If our microbiota plays a role in keeping us healthy, then how about attacking disease by treating the microbiota? After all, our community of microbes is quite plastic. New members can arrive and take up residence. Old members can get flushed out. Member ratios can shift. The human genome, meanwhile, is comparatively stiff and unresponsive\".\"The human genome is comparatively stiff and unresponsive\". Yup. Gonna really need the rest of the world to make that body properly. Those fundamentalist gene-centric keep forgetting that.And \"fecoprospecting\", for another. There's a research effort to go outside the developed world to collect gut bacteria before our processed foods diet renders some strains extinct. So, they fan to rural Africa and Asia, the Amazon, and other areas where traditional foods are still eaten.In some cases, doctors will, for people with very unhealthy digestive systems, perform a fecal transplant from a healthy donor. I know what you are visualizing, shoving poop up someone's butt, but instead they dilute the feces in saline solution and run a tube down your nose and esophagus and stomach to deliver it to the small intestine. I would almost prefer the butt entry.But it makes me wonder if some future medicine show on the TV will have something like:Doctor: \"Well, we are all done here. And now, nurse, Mr. Henderson is ready for his fecal engraftment\".Nurse:   \"We have several poopsicles thawed out, Doctor\".Doctor: \"Excellent. What flavor poopsicle would you like, Mr. Henderson?\"Mr. Henderson: \"Amish, I think\"."},
{"title": "Narrow Escapes", "date": "Thursday, April 18, 2013", "text": "\"Anything I'm really good at probably isn't that hard to do\" - Baby BrotherCorollary: \"That's why I never give 110%\".Anyone else worried about the Singularity? (Is it that time to talk about it again? No it isn't!) I'm not worried. First off, I see no signs of us even coming close. Secondly, I'm convinced that if it does occur it will be wholly by accident, and without the need for the agency of accelerated super-intelligence.Currently, the artificial intelligence field is dominated by weak AIs, or as I prefer to call them, Narrow AIs. Programs that perform tasks like voice recognition, or chess playing, or Jeopardy questions do not, as it turns out, require a well-rounded education or a smooth, sophisticated, urbane personality. They do not possess a generalized intelligence that we clever monkeys (perhaps foolishly) pride ourselves on possessing, which is called Strong AI, or Broad AI.So we are faced with something of a riddle. I know that IQ points as such don't really mean much, but let's assume they do, and let's further assume that your average human possesses 100 IQ points. So, a top of the line model, like Einstein or Newton is around what 250 or so? And even then, that's a narrow IQ. Einstein may have been good at physics, but not everything. Why, I'd be willing to bet he was lousy at building garden sheds, or starting fires rubbing sticks together. In fact, the last time a human animal had to be a really generalist was probably back when we were all hunter/gatherers, back when, if a tool or a weapon broke, you had to fashion a new one from scratch. So we ourselves are to one degree or another, Narrow AIs (just without the artifice part).So, my suspicion is even though we as a species are good at a lot of things, maybe those things aren't that hard. But then, again, and here's the riddle, we can create things that do not exist in Nature, like H-bombs and nanotechnology, synthetic biology and quantum teleportation. Are those things hard to do? If not then, what could an animal with a thousand IQ points do? A million IQ points? We can't know the answer if those IQ points are general intelligence points, but we already have a good idea if those points are narrow, if they are field specific (keeping in mind we are treating these points as meaning something).Take Deep Blue. That program was designed with the sole purpose of beating Garry Kasparov in chess. So, hard can chess be? Well, pretty fucking hard, to beat Kasparov. (Although, it turns out, Kasparov was beaten by a bug in the program. On the very first game, Deep Blue made a move towards the end which was tactically illogical, but later analysis by Kasparov and his team revealed a deep strategic move seeing at some 20 moves ahead in the game. This revelation froze Kasparov's heart solid with fear. It screwed up his head. Only later was it found out that the move Deep Blue made was an error, a random default the program would commit if it could find no viable moves).How about IBM's Watson? Was that program designed to make inferences and connections between categories, to understand sideways references, and engage in both vertical reasoning and lateral imagining, or to win the game of Jeopardy? And as such, IBM's Watson is only good at what you train it intensively on. And that's fine. And it's probably human, given that humans designed it.But is it Broad AI? No.We are increasingly entering the world of Narrow AIs. We are also, as a result going to increasingly enter the world of major catastrophes and disasters committed upon our society by Narrow AIs. And if we get through them, the question will become: If we keep having these narrow escapes, how hard can the disasters be? After all, in the Terminator movies, Skynet was defeated by roach technologies wielded by the dregs and remnants of humanity. How hard could it have been to defeat it?And maybe, it's the really big one where we find out just how smart we are. Or not."},

These sanctimonious control freak types love to talk about liberty, but it's liberty on their terms, for and about them, and they seem so intent upon forcing their vision of America upon the rest of us. Why can't they just stay at home and furiously masturbate over their grand vision? Save us all some trouble.Yes, once upon a time, the hippies did that type of thing. For a brief period. But for the majority of this nation's history, it's been the right wing hillbilly rednecks that have been the greatest enemies of democracy. All you need do is read to figure that out.In any case, long ago, when I was working on something, I would recognize when I entered into chimp mode. Chimp mode is when you start using anything within reach as a hammer - even if a hammer is available. Wrench within reach?Screwdriver within reach? Use it as a hammer.

THey enter chimp mode quite easily.But it takes an adult to really fuck up something. And the thing is, they usually think they are being quite clever when they abuse a tool. They have a problem. They're too stupid to work it out properly, but they figure a workaround which solves their immediate problem, and fucks up the technology they chose to abuse to solve it.I mean, it's even stuff like the handle a bucket has been cracked because some clever fucking chimp used it as a lever or a shim or a spacer and they've ruined what it your wildest imaginations you would never expect to possibly be fucked up.

{"title": "They's All Full Of Shit", "date": "Tuesday, April 9, 2013", "text": "Over the years, I've obviously become even more of a curmudgeon than when I was younger. That's almost a law of Nature, I think. So, in my youth, I was pretty open-minded about a lot of things, especially New Age Hippie Stuff. But over time, you find out it's about 99% horse-shit, just scams put out by charlatans to separate you from your monies.That other 1$% though? That's where the interesting stuff is, and even though I now work under the operating principle of being closed-minded until convinced otherwise, that leaves a large area open to inquiry. One thing, though, is I will always treat the theoretical explanations as suspect and contingent.(I'll give you an example. Back in my teens, my brother and I became familiar with Wilhelm Reich's cloudbusters. At a friend's girlfriend's house, we made use of their pool and an elongated aluminum pool cleaner pole to attempt to bust up some clouds. (This was contrary to Reich's advice that a series of parallel copper tubes connected to a body of water were necessary and that one aluminum tube, according to my brother \"probably wouldn't work\").  That day, there was a whole herd of nice fat puffy cumulus clouds up in the an otherwise blue sky. We pointed the \"device\" at a cloud, and, I swear, a giant circular hole appeared in it. We next pointed the device at the edge of another cloud, and it grew towards where the tube was directed. We freaked. Since we didn't know what was causing it, and didn't know what other effects might be taking place, we left it alone. Years later, I asked my brother and my friend if they remembered what happened that day. My friend did not, but my brother did. I wondered if, since we directed the device, rather than their being any ionization laser effect or orgone, or whatever the hell it was, if it was simply observer dependent, or just a hallucination. Since we did not have access to videotape, we didn't know. But a quick search of youtube yields nothing even close to what we did. I swear, a circular hole of sky in the middle of the cloud within about sixty seconds).So, to the point. Regarding a (really, actually) tiny kerfuffle involving two players arguing over a TED entertainment moment, my final comment was \"They's all full of shit\".Which is true, but I think I owe a fuller explanation. I think the two gentlemen in question, Jerry Coyne and Rupert Sheldrake are both just entertainers pushing their own little extravaganza. And both operate under a primitive metaphysics - the former relying on materialism, the latter on mentation. Neither metaphysical explanation offers any real explanation, and few people seem to understand that.I've nothing against showmanship. Science, going all the way back to the beginning, back when natural philosophy and sorcery were almost indistinguishable, has made use of showmanship and attention-grabbing spectacles. The first official demonstrator to the Royal Society, Robert Hooke, comes to mind. Before him, there was Cornelius van Drebbel, who chose not to disabuse his audience of dabbling in the black arts where it suited the presentation of his spectacles, most notably presented to his patron King James I. Demonstration being the keyword here. I don't really give a crap about your theoretical just-so story, because they are contingent upon prior knowledge and so often open to revision. I would instead rely upon (as has been so successful these past 300 years) repeatable demonstration. Do that for me, and I will have no choice but to pay attention. Start in on gene-centric biology or morphic fields or The Secret, and you've got to put a lot of convincing in to win me over.So, forward to Coyne and Sheldrake. Coyne, I think, is a preformationist. He believes, along with many fundamentalist Darwinists like Richard Dawkins that that pretty much explains everything. I can't help but think that explanation is not only too pat, but fails to explain a lot of what we see. And that's fine, as long they think they can explain an RNA world, protein synthesis, epigenetic tags, and whole plethora of demonstrations that show that DNA is not entirely the software running the show. Wrong. Bad metaphor, anyway. Life is not machines or computers, certainly not a vonNeumann architecture machine or computer. True DNA is hardware, to some extent, cobbled together semi-randomly, certainly, but there's a ratchet, a strange attractor that looks like a goal-oriented process. But DNA is not software tape running the cell like some old IBM computer. DNA is the cell's books, the library. Books where it is easier to store shit than out in the hustle bustle of proteins, enzymes, and RNA.Coyne, you and your boys have had a good run, but the buildup of strange biological facts is starting to overwhelm the old gene-centric models, and your increasingly livid protests suggest you are just not intellectually curious enough to look further. No problem there. There are plenty of non-entertainer scientists getting Nobel prizes looking at that stuff. After all, that's one of the best ways to get a Nobel prize, is to overturn existing \"orthodoxy\".And no, I don't buy into the plaintive whine about scientific dogma and persecuted heretics. Which brings us to Sheldrake. Sheldrake has had thirty years to come up with a really elegant experiment proving or disproving his theory of morphogenic fields. He has come up with some interesting results, such as dogs that know masters are coming home, or that people can sense being stared at, or possibly a few valid statistical tests suggesting something like telepathy (albeit, such an awful and unreliable sense as to be practically worthless as a survival mechanism). All interesting stuff, but not a single experiment that definitively rules (pro or con) on morphogenic fields or what have you.No, seriously. These are all very sloppy, very messy, very noisy, poorly thought out experiments he has done. (When in comparison to, say, Lavoisier's Demolishing of Phlogiston, or Michaelson and Morley's Nondetection of Luminiferous Aether, or Aspect's testing of John Bell's theorem, which destroyed utterly the prospect of Bohm's localized implicate order).Sheldrake, baby, you've way, way too many variables to account for. Why not simplify? Put giraffe fetuses (at later and later stages of development) in a blender, and see if or when the giraffe morphic attribute ceases to produce a giraffe?Why start with animals? You are an accomplished biochemist. Surely there are experiments involving protein chirality and abiogenesis to do. Borrow some moon dust, extract the carbon and introduce it into viruses to see if there is any in performance. Still too messy? True. After all, a size comparison of a water molecule to a small piece of viral RNA is about the same as the size of a man to the Empire State Building. Even folded proteins of enzymes are gigantic siege engines in comparison to the amino acids - the simplest building blocks for proteins - that comprise them. Organic molecules are very large and very complex. Maybe try something smaller. How about a chlorophyll vehicle for a photosynthetic Wheeler's delayed choice experiment? How about spontaneous arrangement of plasmonic metasurfaces using carbon, something that has never, as far as we know, existed before? In other words, Dr. Sheldrake, give up on the Vegas magic spectaculars, and try thinking harder for proof one way or the other.In any case, I've hopefully constructively expanded upon my \"full of shit\" statement.But I do stand by my continual sneers at TED. Ideas worth spreading according to whom. Big Ideas?

I've to burn out wax from the student's ceramic investment shells. This occurs in an old Alpine gas kiln. The previous lab tech made a hole in the floor of the kin to recover melted wax. Directly underneath, on the floor is a metal tray filled with water to collect the molten wax.After the fireThis is the kiln here:I should note that this kiln had a roof fall on it, and ten inches x 40 x 30 foot (that's one thousand cubic feet) of roof water run through it. Didn't even faze it. They dried it out and fired it right up.So, I'm in a hurry to get the wax burnt out. Long story short, I throw in a bunch of ceramic shell before it has properly cooled down, and cranked the heat.It's a gamble. I've done it before. I've done it and had a wax fire underneath. Most of the time, my coping strategy for this is to get on my hands and knees and stare underneath the kiln at the fire, with a fire extinguisher next to me, and hope it goes out.On two prior occasions (years apart, as I've been teaching the class for six years now), the fire didn't go out, and I would have to use the fire extinguisher. Just a couple of spritzes, not the whole canister.So this time, it didn't go out. It got pretty big, actually. The whole kiln was covered in fire. I had to use the whole extinguisher. oops. And then another.I really, had I the presence of mind, should have grabbed my camera and filmed it. Ah, but I was a little busy. And honestly, being on the floor was the best option, as you could not see for the black smoke surrounding.And, then, an hour later I did it all over again. Two bad gambles in one day.The leavings of the cleanupIt's amazing that we don't get more complaints or visits from the fire department, but apparently our portion of the building engulfed in acrid black smoke gains only slight notice.I make light of this, only because I don't have much of a choice. The cleanup took a few hours. Scraping wax and dry chemicals off surfaces around the kiln. And I got a tickly throat from the smoke from the burned petroleum wax and extinguisher chemicals, which I'm sure is no good for me. But there you go.Clearly, the older I get, the more stupid I become."},

Maybe you're too young for that. I don't know if they still do that. I remember getting prepped slides in a microscope kit I had as a child. I also had a chemistry set. You could buy the most dangerous chemicals at the dry goods store. Anyway...That's what I was thinking of when I created this shadow box of a mechanicule. Cast glass, with an aluminum frame, in a formal wooden box:Here's the deal. In the process of putting this box together, I dropped the cast glass piece. It shattered on the upper left corner, and a wedge of the bottom right corner broke clean. I was so angry, I couldn't curse properly.

One of my student aides was in the room, absolutely petrified. I finally managed \"GET OUT!\". I think maybe I sobbed for about a second, and then carefully picked up all the pieces I could find. The shattered corner was a wash. The rest I managed to glue together. But I cant' sell this piece now.

{"title": "Followup on \"Deadbeats\"", "date": "Thursday, March 14, 2013", "text": "The BBC has put out a story indicating that the reason Neanderthals are extinct is because they had large eyes like the paintings of large-eyed children I remember seeing in my dentist's office when I was a child. The Just-So story we are told is, because Neanderthals needed larger eyes for to see in the dim, dark conditions of Europe, this resulted in their brains requiring more space for visual processing and less for reasoning and mental gymnastics. Whereas we Hobo Sapiens, evolving under the bright skies of Africa, just out-thunk the Neanderthals and they fell over and died.Destined ForExtinctionAm I the only one that thinks this theory is retarded?Here's my proposal. My very first essay on blogger was devoted to Neanderthals. It was my contention (still is) that a lot of our oral folk traditions are based on true events. And so all of the those stories about gods versus demons or gods versus titans were our telling of struggles between our species and other human species. So, all those giants and ogres, and elves, and goblins, and fairies, and vampires, and werewolves, were all species that we Homo Sapiens in our infinite wisdom, killed off.So, Neanderthals did have big eyes, and a large portion at the back of their skulls to process visual data, called the 'occipital bun'. And the reason they had these big eyes and a large visual cortex was for seeing in the dark. Neanderthals were creatures of the night. Our folk tales speak of them, as bogeymen, the monster under the bed, the things that go bump in the night. They came out at night to hunt, and, if they could, they'd hunt for human flesh.So, naturally us daytime monsters had to get rid of those nighttime monsters, and there you go. Certainly as plausible as the other just-so story.But that's not entirely what I want to talk about, although it is indirectly related. I've been considering a little world-building problem involving my occasional exploration into science fiction called the Convergence.Short version, humanity has sparsely populated the universe via wormhole conduits, meaning no spaceships, no spaceports, no spacefaring infrastructure, and doing it all with what amounts to late 20th century tech. So, these wormholes are fickle things, and for the longest time passage through one amounted to a one-way trip with no return. It was only, say, twenty years after the first foray that humans learned the trick of return trips to Earth. As a result, there's a lot of lost colonies out there in the cosmos, some of which would never be heard from again. And there's the problem involving colonization.Let's say you've got this big hole. On the other side of this big hole is whole new world, lush and green and filled with fresh air, sunshine and animals and clean water and absolutely no people. The hole is going to stay open for a short time, and while it's open, you can go back and forth. But eventually the hole will close and will never reappear again. You know this. You know if go through and stay, you will be stuck in this new world for good.What do you take with? Oh, one other restriction is you are confined to, say nothing more advanced than 1990s technology.Well, here's my thinking. You walk into this new world, you'll want to have an idea of what your base technology will be. In other words, you don't come over expecting to use internal combustion engines, since you don't where the oil is, you don't know when you'll have refineries built, you don't have any of the chemical and electrical infrastructure. Similarly, you probably don't bring coal-fire locomotives over. So, in my view, you start out with a base technology of around, say, 1820 or so. You've got high pressure steam engines that burn wood. You've got a lot of spare parts for that. Oh sure, you bring as many modern amenities and appliances and generators and fuel and airplanes and satellite launching rockets and computers as you can shove through the hole, and use as it long as it all lasts. You may have mini-factories stashed in 40 foot shipping containers. You've got a shitload of books. And skilled people. And food. And seeds. And... what else? In other words, this becomes a prepper problem. The world falls apart. How to rebuild it?Because, you figure, no matter how much shit you shove through the hole, you just can't support a modern world, not without billions of people.One thing you'd really to like to have, and don't, would be robots. But then you get to thinking, you know what makes a really good robot, if you don't mind caring and feeding and cleaning up after it? Animals. Domesticated animals. And you know what makes the best robots of all? Slaves.And so we are presented with an ethical problem. Do we allow for indentured servitude? Chattel slavery? Is this a good way to start a colonization effort?What was the point regarding Nation of Deadbeats? Well, it turns out the commonality is colonization. And reading through American history, what you find is the entire colonizing effort was completely subsidized. Don't buy all this libertarian bullshit about rugged individuals carving out their spot in a barren wilderness with their own two hands. Didn't happen. There was a concerted effort to get everyone else to do the work for them. Indentured servants. save labor, cheap labor, zombies, robots, robot zombies, it didn't matter. That was just one long free ride for Anglo-Americans. Don't let anyone bullshit you about that."},
{"title": "Book Report: A Nation of Deadbeats", "date": "Wednesday, March 13, 2013", "text": "A Nation of Deadbeats: An Uncommon History of America's Financial Disasters by Scott Reynolds Nelson is a narrative of the larger panics and depressions that have occurred from Revolutionary Times to the Great Depression, and good descriptor of all the events is \"Same shit, different day\".I'd have to agree with this Seattle Times reviewer  (I would also suggest that Tyler Cowen's one line review of the book is appropriately succinct: \"We have hardly ever had a well-functioning banking system\") that the book is fascinating and unfocused. I don't see how, given the author's intent, that it could be otherwise. If ever there was an economic sector in need of nationalization, it's the financial sector. If any other industry was run like the banks, the operators would not only be shit-canned, they'd be facing significant prison time. That fact that Wall Street is not in jail pretty much tells you how reality is here in the Western world, and as we find out from Mr. Nelson's book, it has ever been thus.To strengthen my point, I suggest you read the last two chapters first, and in fact, read the very last chapter first - Here Be Dragons: What's Wrong with How Historians and Economists have Written About Financial Panics.\"Much of the crisis literature in the past fifty years has come from economic historians who, following Milton Friedman, begin as neo-classical economists but quickly adopt an Austrian-school attitude toward crises: that the state is to blame... I'm not convinced that state institutions are to blame for any of the crises (1792 - 1929) I've described here, with the possible exception of 1893. And in that crisis one could argue quite convincingly that private corruption of federal officeholders in the elimination of the sugar tariff caused the panic\".I've never understood why anyone could not find Friedman and the Chicago School neo-classical economic system riddled with unrealistic and irrational assumptions surrounding self-interested rational players and efficient markets when panic selling, panic buying and manic/depressive forms of leverage and margin calls exist on a daily basis. For any intelligent adult to move from that unsupportable position, already batshit crazy, to the bugfuck craziness of the Austrian school is, to me, to enter furthest reaches of the dangerously stupid. But that's just me:\"The other Friedman cul-de-sac is the obsession with the money supply. He and his followers miss the fact that crises are and always have been crises in productive assets - the promises in the trunk. Those promises allow banks to function. Friedman's argument about the money supply's being the most important variable works only if we sharply divide \"money\" (expressed as a non-appreciating asset) from \"appreciating assets\". But as the Federal Reserve wold have told you when it gave up trying to measure the money supply in the 1980s, there were so many competing non-moneys and semi-moneys that it found it was chasing a chimera. Money is not really measurable, and it comes into Friedman's analysis to explain events that have bubbled out of control long before he gets to them.\"    More simply put, government has always been the convenient scapegoat for the torch and pitchfork crowd, as it - unlike privatized frauds and charlatans - has nowhere to hide. Banksters, on the other hand, have almost always been able to distract the rubes and make a clean getaway. Hey, crime pays. In this book, you get to meet some of the business criminal parasitic vampire assholes responsible. You also get to see the consequences - both intended (Glass-Steagal) and unintended (the Civil War) that result. And also other consequences, like the Mormon church, juke boxes, Moby Dick, etc.My take: Anyone who has studied American history beyond the 4th grade level (this excludes most Mormons and Glenn Beck) realizes that:the United States of America has only recently, as in only the past one hundred years, been an important world powerthe Founding Fathers were not saints, and the Constitution and Declaration of Independence were not not handed to them personally by God Almightyit is by the fact that we as a nation were willing to rob, cheat, steal, murder, rape, and enslave that we are in the materially fortunate position we are in today, andit's true that any other nation would have done the same thing, but that's still a child's excuse for explaining away all evil deeds committed by all of our brilliant but viciously brutal evil deed doers in defense of \"Freedumb!\"\"FREEDUMB!\", that libertarian vision of walking around with a big old stinky load in the back of one's pants, and not only not caring, but actually being proud of that load, has only very recently been extended from white male property owners to a limited form of universality.These are all things you must keep in mind as you read the book. You must realize - with Americans -that you are dealing with ignorant, dumb, mean-spirited, shit-covered animals living on the subsidies of the British Empire. They are also serving as the fibrous tendril ends of a Lovecraftian horror of an extraction network known as the British Empire, and the pulsing brain of this nightmare superorganism is the Bank of England - at least up until 1914.To illustrate, consider what the planter George Mason recalled to Patrick Henry (soon after the end of Revolutionary War) an \"absurd question\" that one of his constituents asked:\"If we are now to pay the Debts due to British merchants, what have we been fighting for all this while?\" Mason was appalled.\"Well, of course one must settle one's debts! (Unless, of course, you happen to be a southern planter who can't settle and so welch on their payments, as Mason's descendants were later to do during the panic of 1837. When they invented a whole new word to justify welching on one's wagers, called \"repudiation\" in 1841 and refused to pay British banks. English capitalists with very long memories would remember this word when Confederate agents came humbly calling, hats in hands, for war loans a decade later).\"Between 1776 and 1783, many American promises were made, but few were paid. After the Treaty of  Paris in 1783, as courts reopened, state began collecting taxes. Creditors, from soldiers who had served to merchants from New York to Liverpool, began to demand repayment. Many private debtors resisted. Between 1783 and 1786, states were in tumult over back taxes, unpaid personal debts, and land foreclosures. Armed insurrections against repossessions and property liquidations bubbled up in the western arts of Virginia, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. The turmoil made the national government seem all the more ineffective. By 1787, in order to \"insure domestic tranquility\", their representatives convened to draft a new constitution to strengthen the central government. Debt was the foremost problem. States were forced to surrender their unsettled land to Congress. This new and more powerful Congress consolidated state and federal debt under a national bank, which in turn restructured the debts through the rock-solid institutions of the Baring Brothers of London, and the House of Rothschild.   Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton knew that basing a currency upon gold or silver (what he called \"dead stock\" as it earned nothing when it traveled from one bank to another) was nothing compared to trust. Yes, trust, as in a solid reputation. In 1791, Hamilton got his wish when Congress chartered the Bank of the United States. Simple goodwill did not get the bill passed; half of the congressmen who voted for the measure also got preferred access to the initial public offering of bank stock. Needless to say, stockholders in the bank had a much easier time of securing loans as well\".So, think about that friends. 2nd amendment there to protect stalwart citizens against the tyranny of government? Or, more likely, to have a ready militia available when those fucking ingrate hinterland deadbeats not only won't pay their loan-shark bills, but get all upitty and in your face about it.Consider... Well, here, I'll pull out a $20, and look at who is on there, and it is, lo and behold, Andrew Jackson. As far as assholes go, he ranks way up there. What's Jackson famous for? The Indian Removal Act. Trail of Tears? The destruction of the Second Bank of the United States, and the resulting panic of 1837? The resulting ascension of the Whig Party? The trashing of the White House at his inauguration? No, Nelson makes a pretty good argument that Jackson was Captain Ahab in his novel Moby Dick.Although, let's face it, Jackson cottoned (pun intended) to the real asshole power in America, the Southern planter. Here are the notes I scribbled about that:Panic of 1837. Cotton gin makes green seed cotton profitable. Cotton the first collateralized debt obligation with English banks. Filibrustering (privately organized territory grabs , eg. theft) for SW territory lands. Filibuster armies invade Red Stick territories in Northern Miss and Alabama. (Small government, weak enough not to stop our hare-brained filibuster army schemes to get free land, but not so weak the federal army can't rescue them when they get into trouble). Jackass Andrew Jackson forces through Indian Removal Act. Trail of Tears. Cotton bubble. Slave bubble. Price of cotton slumps. English banks demand their monies. Repudiation, a new word coined by Southern Governors meaning \"F you, we won't pay our bills\". England remembers the South's credit history later during the War Between the States. Finances the Union.Hey, while I'm at it, since it is eventually related, here's my scribblings on the Panics of 1857, 1873, 1893:Panic of 1857. Competing visions of where America should be heading (sound familiar?). Railroads and indentured European servants are winning over the Slave Empire in the territory of Kansas. Slave Empire fucks things up with the revised Swamp Act to get even. Congress 1858 session considers two stimulus packages. The Northern plutocrat controlled Republican party favored spending on western railroads, agricultural colleges, land for settlers. The southern aristocracy dominated Democrats favored annexing Cuba so that more slaves would be available to Deep South states, lowering the price of slaves and allowing poor white to live the dream of cotton farming.1873. America exports cheap food to Europe. Europe exports cheap people back.1893. The Sugar Trust fucks everything up for everyone.In summary, and completely unrelated, Nelson (like Obama) suggests that America is not a deadbeat nation... but we are a nation of deadbeats. All the supposed worry expressed by so-called deficit hawks over the national debt is completely unfounded and tragically misplaced. The Federal government has always - will always - pay its debts. It is the states, cities, counties, municipalities, corporations, and people who welch on their bets. Currently, the federal government owes a measly $16 trillion to its creditors (mainly the American people). Corporate and private debt, on the other hand, currently total some $38 trillion, with around $17 trillion of that in corporate/financial debt (ignoring the $600 trillion in the unsupervised derivatives market).Debt is, after all, a two-sided beast with one side promising something in the future, and the other side betting that they keep the promise. The problem is, it isn't always the side doing the promising that is the problem."},

The policy is, if the region is expected to receive 7 inches or more of snow, the college closes. This is the third Tuesday in a row that the college has closed down early.We received nine inches of snow yesterday. The previous Tuesday snow was not quite 7 inches, but they closed down at 2:30pm. The subsequent student escape and horrific traffic jams, complaints and bad press caused the college to close down early this time around.I had the place to myself, worked until 6pm, got a lot of my own work done, had no problems with the roads getting home, and, honestly, I could handle about six more of these kinds of snow days with no distractions and annoyances.Now, let's see if I've got the pattern down. Two years ago, we had blizzards. A year ago at this time we  had a scary twelve day stretch of 80 degrees. Now this year we have no snow throughout the winter, and then late snows that gets us back into normal precipitation for the season. Word is that the eastern Midwest has pretty much made up for the 2012 summer drought, and a bumper corn crop is expected this year.This is reminds of a quote I heard about sub-Saharan Africa \"We don't have seasons anymore.

{"title": "Fermi Problems", "date": "Friday, March 1, 2013", "text": "Driving in to work, I notice at a red light the car in front of me has snow slowly sliding off the trunk. The snow patch will, before it slides completely off, break. Question, how far can the snow patch slide off the end of the trunk before it breaks? This is a Fermi problem. You want other examples? How many piano tuners are there in the city of Chicago? How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie-pop? Things like that.Before the age of twenty-five, I wouldn't even know how to formulate the problem. That was, as I recall, my biggest frustration in physics class. I could do the math just fine, once I knew the equation. It was figuring out what the equation was, what the terms were, that drove me buggy. So, with the snow problem the things to worry about without actually having any hard data would be, the tensile strength of slush, the total cross-section of the patch, the total area of the patch, frictional coefficient of a wet hood, angle of descent, constant of gravity, weight of slush. Things like that. I won't work it out, but that was the kind stuff I could not even begin to get straight. And then, maybe around the age of twenty-seven, that all got easy. What happened? Well, I figure, like a yeasty rising loaf, my prefrontal lobes finally hit the front edge of my brain pan. My brain had matured. About fucking time. And too late to affect my shitty grade in physics class.So, in that great chain of being that is our technology and culture (the two are synonymous), thinking about source networks for stuff and people, I wonder, as a Fermi Problem, just how far back do we have to go? I mean, when you consider it, if the Big Bang was really something from nothing, do we have to go that far back for your toothbrush or trombone?If not, then what? What about the most basic sources of the source resources? Clearly, one could start with supernovae, to get elements beyond iron, but do we need to go that far back? And is that really a concern? After all, given existence, time, space, and hydrogen, it should be easy to trend out to star formation, heavy elements, planets, blah.So, when do things get interesting? Not to say that a lifeless universe isn't interesting, but, hey, when it comes to technology, credit where credit is due, and the materials we use that are of non-biological origin are pretty much limited to the Stone Age. Things like granite, and flint, and that's about it, I suppose. But everything else ultimately has a biological culprit behind. Yes, even iron and precious metals. Ore from banded iron deposits is there due to oxygen (or lack thereof), and oxygen in our atmosphere is clearly of biological origin. Why, even metals such as gold and silver are concentrated in the crust due to a series of actions involving tectonic plate movements and subduction. The invagination of Earth's mantle with materials like water, carbon, calcium: things that act as a flux to make thing slippery down there, is all attributable to life - so far as we know. (There is suggestion of tectonic actions on Venus and Mercury, but, honestly , not likely).So, it looks like we need to go back to the First Singularity - organic life. And see, that takes us back to the Hadean, when things are very hazy indeed. But come on, now? Really? We have to go back four billion years to get the true cost of a candy bar? And if we count the origin of life as the first singularity (in other words, trying to trend from just non-biological processes without counting on the game changer called life = all bets are off), what the subsequent singularities?Honestly, probably the really big game changer has got to be the Eukaryotic Revolution, or as I call it, the age of acquisitions. Basically, with the advent of internal commensalism, you've got what amounts to free R&D, what with the design-build-test cycle considerably enhanced, shortened, and (ah-ha-hah) the first bug built in as a feature. And perhaps the first of example of rapid prototyping and open source (perhaps). Regardless, through hindsight, the arrival of multicellular creatures and metazoans and then visible animals and plants was almost a foregone conclusion.This is all more than mere partnership. This is a case of mutual surrender, a form of trust and the sharing of paired weaknesses that is unprecedented. It is a form of exposing the belly a billion years before the metaphor could actually even occur. This is what the term community is about.But I digress, we are still some eight hundred million years before present. Do we really need to go back that far in the resource chain? I kind of think yes, but give me a few days to decide."},
{"title": "The Pope Smokes Dope", "date": "Wednesday, February 27, 2013", "text": "The title of this essay has nothing to do with it. I just remembered that T-shirt inspired by Dabid Peel's song. David Peel was a muse for the Yippie and hippie movements, so I guess thematically, they share the same cluelessness that the current crop of Ron-Paul-style libertarians do.In the third season of the show Breaking Bad, there is a brief exchange between the characters Walter White and Gale Boetticher, where Walter asks (since Gale is an above average person who could have had a promising career in academia as a chemist, but lacked the impulse control to tolerate the bullshit) how Gale ended up cooking meth. Walt asks, basically, gesturing around the meth lab, \"Why here?\" And Gale's response is (paraphrased from memory):\"Well, I'm a libertarian. People are going to get what they want. At least with me, they get what they pay for. No adulterations. No toxins\".Ignore, if you will, the basic lunacy of this statement. That Gale is manufacturing toxin-free poison, and that Gale feels that there should be no restraints (barring the standard libertarian bullshit about harm, which clearly is a relative thing), let's concentrate on the libertarian fallacy of appeal to reason. This is a one of many classic examples of what is wrong with libertarianism: the substitution of rationalization for reason.  Libertarians ignore the irrationality of their premises, and rely solely upon the supposed soundness of a logical argument. But anyone who studies logic knows that logic is merely a tool, one that can produce completely wrong results with completely watertight syllogisms, and even the most rational premises (even in mathematical proofs) are founded upon at least twenty irrational assumptions. The primary irrational assumption is what I call Platonic Derangement Syndrome; the idea that perfect worlds that perfect ideas inhabit actually exist. \"Real\" free markets would operate perfectly, perfectly efficient, perfectly rational. \"Real\" communism would be perfectly equitable. Here's the deal. The real world is as real as it gets. \"Real\" free markets, and \"real\" communism, operating in the real world, favor the  most reprehensible behaviors imaginable.Take Ayn Rand's Objectivism, which purports to be some kind of philosophy (um, yeah, if it's the horse-shit kind). Ayn Rand was clearly a fundamentally vicious, petty, small-minded, infantile thinker, and it shows in her writings. Take her boringly awful and fucked-up manifesto Atlas Shrugged, for example. It's basically a teenage revenge masturbation fantasy riddled with inconsistency and unintentional ironies. Did I say teenage? Try infantile, as in the Gault's Gulch \"You'll be sorry when I'm gone\" suicide/parental-murder injustice fantasy variation of A Christmas Story's Soap Poisoning scene:Rand relied upon the supposed consistency of her logical constructions to identify faulty premises. Rand clearly never heard of Kurt Gödel. Among his many contributions, Gödel developed a theorem that stated that any sufficiently complex system of logical statements will either be incomplete - or -inconsistent. Incomplete, in the sense that there could statements which were true or false within the system but which could not be proven (or disproven) true or false. Inconsistent in that the system contained statements which were contradictory, thus rendering the system utter bullshit.  Either way, Rand's Objectivism (with its sadly and pathetically crafted Three Axioms) falls short of being considered anything worthwhile. Regardless, libertarianism - Randian or otherwise - is symptomatic of a fundamentally deep-seated viciousness that has been incorporated into a set of moralities little seen outside of the Western Enlightenment world. And small wonder, given that - even with the supposed rationality of the Enlightenment - American behaviors are founded upon the most brutish and vile barbarisms extant throughout the species. Not that this is new or unique to Western civilization (I've a sneaking suspicion there is a genocidal tale to be told about the Neolithic Han Chinese). We Westerners don't have a monopoly on behaving badly, but we do have a thriving franchise going.But that's not what I want to talk about. I'm thinking about debt lately. What is debt? What is money? I read a book last year that attempted to answer those questions. Now, I'm reading another book with a bit more of an American flair. I'll do a book report on it later, but if interested, check out:  A Nation of Deadbeats. (Short review so far? This is the people's version of debt, ala Howard Zinn). So, monies, debt, what is all that? Simple. Debt, like Soylent Green, is people. More specifically, debt and monies are people's toil, or the promise of future toil, or the reward of past toil, or the faith in the promise of either future or past or current toil (which is another way looking at symbolic transference). Things that we think of as commodities, like gold, timber, oil, coal, etc. are all a product of toil. More specifically, labor combined with ingenuity, but let's just call the combined spectrum of muscle and brain work as \"toil\". Gold, at one time, was pure lumps you just picked up off the ground or out of river beds. Eventually the lumps ran out and more effort was required to find gold. Introduce toil into the equation. Some forms of mining pull out ores that are not pure gold, but contain it. Introduce more toil. Same with coal. Same with oil. As the easy sources disappear, more toil is required. More ingenuity. More effort. More waste. Resources are not exhausted, they merely become more dear (and unfortunately for our species, or any intelligent species, despite all the peak-this or peak-that talk, we've plenty of resources left to exploit, and our living conditions and survival as a species are the limiting factor - not hazards to the planet or resources scarcity). So, if you look a map of ancient Rome and you wonder about the geopolitical boundaries, you really, to get the real picture, need a series of resource maps, for geology, ecology, trade routes, etc. Logistics and human trafficking is what it is all about, babies. Question: what was the oil of ancient Rome? Answer: Grain.Question: What is the oil of the modern world? Answer: Still grain. Why? Well, because despite the fact that we may have built up what some call an extended phenotype of technology, driven in one form or another by fossil carbon and oxygen, despite the fact that so many laborious tasks have been commodified and automated and robot-assisted, despite the fact that automation and a great deal of skills and thinking have been commodified and robotized, and the mental effort involved in that commodified as well, the fact of the matter is it all still runs right back to toil - labor and ingenuity on the part of these self-replicating, generally intelligent heuristic robots we call humans.I remember reading a book by David Gerrold called The World Of Star Trek. And the book was mainly about the Star Trek folk canon and mythology, but there was also an interesting bit in there about world building. The way I remember it was, Gerrold asked the question \"What was going on behind the Enterprise?\" And before you could answer, he said, let me re-pose the question, \"Pretend the Enterprise is a 747. What exactly is behind that 747?\" And for the first time, I actually thought about the web of technology, of systems thinking, of adult stuff actually, the whole wellhead-to-pump-nozzle-and-all-ancillary-supports graph network of thinking and doing that busy little creatures engage in. A 747 is made of aluminum and steel, and uses jet fuel, and lands and takes off at an airport, and has a flight crew and attendants, and meal and drinks for the passengers, and luggage handlers, and flight controllers. And that aluminum has to be dug up out of the ground, and smelted and fabricated into an airframe. And the same with steel. And the flight crew needs to be trained. And the food and drink needs to be grown and processed. And before you know it, more than half the world has gone into something involving that 747. And that half the world is people, people that need shit too, and you end up with the other half of the world getting involved as well.And in all that vast and intricate network that has slowly been assembling itself, slowly been growing and getting more complex since the Neolithic Revolution, the question then becomes, not what are your freedoms, but \"Where does your freedom end and mine begin?\""},

The state of Illinois put in a crosswalk with flashing lights for pedestrian access to and from the park. The crosswalk is not the shortest path to the park. Hardly anyone uses it. Fifty feet away from the official crosswalk is a well-worn muddy Indian path that people have created to move from parking to park. I would submit that the crosswalk is to the Indian path as a categorical classification is to real life metaphor.Example: Astrology, either Chinese or Western. I don't buy it, but it doesn't mean the idea of fixed archetypes, or a mixture of same to describe the character and conduct of humanity at large isn't a fun thing to play with. Twelve aspects enough? Mix and match, use a percentage system, and the number of descriptors for personality become very large. Not infinite, but large enough to rationalize just about any description.Example: Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. I was fortunate enough not to have to take this examination, although it is big in business, like so many quick-and-easy scams that management likes to rely, like all those golf aids and crutches designed to improve your game.Example: (and a new one on me) The Process Therapy Model. Taibi Kahler's six personality types with adaptations. This one is a darling of government, NASA more specifically. I quote a relevant passage from Automate This by Christopher Steiner:Emotions-driven people. They try to form relationships and learn about the person they're speaking with before diving into the issue at hand. Women comprise three-quarters of this group, which makes up 30 percent of the total population. Tight situations makes this group dramatic and overreactive.Thoughts-based people. This group tends to do away with pleasantries and go straight for the facts. A rigid form of pragmatism drives most of the decisions they make. Under pressure, they tend to be humorless, pedantic, and controlling.Actions-driven people. Most used-car salesmen would come under this umbrella. They crave progress and action, even in tiny chunks. They're always pushing, prodding, and looking for an angle. Many in this group can be charming. Pressure can drive actions-driven people to irrational, impulsive, and vengeful behavior.Reflections-driven people. This group can be calm and imaginative. They often think more about what could be than working with what already is. These people, when they're interested in something, can drift off for hours while they dig into the new subject. Applying this knowledge to a real-world project, however, is a weakness.Opinions-driven people. The language used by this group is stocked with imperatives and absolutes. They tend to see one side of a situation and will stick to their views even when refuted with proof. More than 70 percent of politicians are opinions-driven people, but the group constitutes only 10 percent of the population as a whole. People from this group can also be tireless workers, who will persistently grind away on a problem until it is solved. Under pressure, their opinions can become weaknesses; they can grow judgmental, suspicious, and sensitive.Reactions-based people. Kahler called this group rebels, but the modern set of standards - and those on which personality-deciphering bots are built- refer to them as reactions people. This group is spontaneous, creative, and playful. They react strongly to things: \"I love that!\" or \"that sucks!\" Many innovators come from this group. Under pressure, they can be stubborn, negative, and blameful.You will notice none of Kahler's categorical personalities works well under pressure.In case you are wondering, I consider myself mostly number 6, and personality-deciphering bot concurred. But Kahler himself says, although personalities may be dominated by one category, they are a mixture of all of them. Again, in case you are wondering, no but I don't buy into this much. After all, a Cosmo-magazine-style questionnaire can't really be all that useful in determining behavior.But I got to wonder about politicians. What selective pressures result in so many douchebags ending up in political office. Or rather, what selective standards within politics result in so many douchebags ending up there?"},
{"title": "Dreams", "date": "Friday, February 15, 2013", "text": "Someone once told me all the elements in your dreams are parts of you, and really only about you.Uh, duh.Dreams how we deal with what's going on, so of course it's all about me.I'm pretty good at remembering my dreams, and I also know that, in general, it's not good form to relate your dreams as they usually boring to other people (because it's not about them). In any case, I am good at remembering dreams. Not just the one you wake up with, but the whole night. So, here's last night's series of dreams.The first one was a depressing dream where due to work necessities, I had to move to Northeast Misery. It was very sad to say goodbye to everyone. But I remember rationalizing that I could head back home on a weekend every month or so, it wouldn't be that bad of a drive, and lots of people have even more disconnected relationships involving greater distances. When I woke up, I looked what the heck is in Northeast Misery and the answer is nothing. No thing. Clark County. The closest city is Keokuk, Iowa. No fucking way I am moving there. So, fuck you, Dreamtime Reality.  The second one may have had a prescient element, although I don't really by into any psychic shit. But here's my theory, based upon observation. You know deja vu? The feeling you've done something or been somewhere before? Well, my theory it is the completion of a cycle in time. I've had moments of deja vu that I can hook up via memory to past moments and future ones. I'll have that feeling, and then there have been times when I realize it's a full circle moment, because I will remember the deja vu moment in the past that corresponds with the one I'm experiencing. It's just a theory, even a convenient fiction, but when I have one of the moments now, and I can't remember a corresponding past moment, then I'm reassured to know I'll survive through to that future deja vu experience. So, now, what's that say when you have a deja vu moment in your dreams? Better still, what's that say when (in the dream) I experience a distracting series of very bright microflashes up in the sky, as if someone were flashing a mirror at you? And then to have someone ask me \"What's going on with Russia, dude?\"And then, to wake up, and see on the news the meteor over Chelyabinsk, a 300 kiloton explosion. Coincidence? Sure, why not. But why the deja vu feeling? Dunno. Guess we'll see.The third one involved a very cute, petite little brunette with deep brown eyes and raven black hair. I don't need to go any further do I? I've always been attracted to small put-together brunettes (it's not just me, my brother has this huge thing for Marisa Tomei and Betty Rubble), and I figured it must be our next-door neighbors when we were little, all the children in the family girls, and all of them very cute small put-together brunettes that I must have imprinted upon as the ideal mate.Then one must explain why I've dated almost all blondes, and mostly tall skinny blondes at that. Well, I think the answer was the childhood neighbor girls (besides being pretty) were very nice, very polite, very considerate, very sweet, cheerful girls. Just wonderful children. And, I'm told, now all wonderful adults.So, the brunette archetype was just a red herring wasn't it? Or rather, a fortunate association."},
{"title": "Heuristically Programmed Algorithmic Computer", "date": "Wednesday, February 13, 2013", "text": "Back when I was a glorified code monkey, I was almost always a rude, arrogant asshole, prima donna,  and an impossible-to-work-with curmudgeon. A lot of things haven't changed.Wait a minute. Before I tell this story, I have to back up. I'm graduated from college, got no job, no jobs prospects, I'm an unemployed alcoholic (or working up to it), and I'm living in my parent's basement.Happy now?Finally desperate, I go to the US Navy recruiter and take the Officer Candidate's test. That test was quite possibly the easiest test I have ever taken in my life. The navy recruiter scored the test, his eyes got very big, and he said in a hushed and reverent and rather awestruck tone (and the Southern accent helped not at all): \"You got every question right!\"As if that had never happened before. Well, I got up, said thank you for your time, and left. There was no way I could enter into an organization where I would be dependent upon people who had gotten even one those dumb questions wrong. This is not to say there are no smart people in the Navy, there are, it's just that I didn't want to be one of them.That probably was a mistake. Because, as it turns out, the business world is pretty much the same place, except you don't worry about getting blown to shit or falling into water, and there's a lot less smart people, and about the same amount of dumb ones.So, fast forward to my first gig, and I had to write programs in COBOL. (COBOL, my dears, was shepherded along by Rear Admiral Grace Murray Harper of the USN, so that should tell where we are going). COBOL is (was) a modern programming language in that it looked more like English than machine language. I had a knack for COBOL, as it turns out, which led to more gigs.Now I should also mention that every single company I worked for is now defunct, extinct, gone from this world. I'd like to think it was me, but no, it's just your standard business dipshittery or bungholery and asshattery that any organization with numbers larger than Dunbar's number is destined to turn into the Soviet Union.  So, since all those companies did the right thing and took a shit, fell over, burned to the water line, and sank into the swamp mud, I just assumed that every bit of my code is also gone, entropied into heat death, and all the machines that code ran on, turned into anchor chains and Conex containers.Imagine my surprise to find out COBOL is still out there! COBOL, as it turns out, still runs a large part of the batch processing world. So, funny thing, since what I did was troubleshooting and production support (which meant aside from bug-hunting, rewriting the shitty code of hotshot programmers so that it would finish a run within the lifetime of the universe), I could probably get a job right now.But let me tell you this story before I get to my point. At one leasing company I cannot name, we had a kid who was assigned to write a cash posting program for accounts receivables. When cash would come in, it would have to be posted into the correct cost center bucket - revenue per inventory item sold or leased. The kid worked on the program for a solid two months, going through what was then the \"methodology\" (even now, that term cause my jaw muscles to bunch up in irritation) of quality control and standards. I was on the review team to look at the code, and it was, even for COBOL, lovely. Elegant, well-documented, simple, easy to follow, and very clever. It involved building what is called a tree data structure where each \"leaf\" was an accounting cost center to receive an appropriate type of cash. As the program ran, and a new type of transaction (or an erroneous transaction or typo) was encountered the structure would create a new branch and leaf to accommodate it. I told him it wouldn't work. When asked why, I said \"After you are gone and moved to on to a shinier and brighter job outside of this shithole, there will very stupid people who have to maintain this program, stupid people who will modify it. I can guarantee you that there will be one stupid person who does not understand your admittedly wonderful lacework you've done here, and will fuck it up completely. Go back and rewrite it so that even the most close-set-eyed, slack-jawed simpleton can understand it\".My advice was rejected, the program was installed, and two years later we could not close the books at end of fiscal year because someone had made a modification to the program a six months prior that subtly hosed about every other 100,000th transaction. I ended up staying awake for 36 hours to fix the code, hunt down all the transactions and get the close going again. I'd hate to think that was the highlight of my life, considering I got basically no tangible reward, but a lot more responsibility, out of the deal. (I was a consultant working outside the company, so I ended up with a very nice letter of commendation, and the person who created the bug six months prior was, per the Peter Principle, promoted sideways into a harmless manager's position. In a rather shabbily disreputable move, I would later - one late night - pour sour milk into the carpeting under this person's desk). So. Robots. Algorithms. Drones. They are all the bugaboo right now. Drones gonna spy on you and take you down. Robots gonna take your job. Algorithms gonna be much better at everything than you are. High Frequency Trading algorithms are gonna become Skynet. It's the dystopian Singularity, the Rise of the Machines.Yeah, right.I think you know where this going, so, why even mention it? I will, though. People fuck up. People are lazy. People are careless. People are impatient. People fuck up in a way that is highly non-Gaussian, and they do it all the time. So there's that.The other problem with all this? They are all of them designed and built by humans. Isn't that the same problem? Well, no. I'm talking about the really smart and conscientious humans. The problem there, the dual problems there, with something like Ray Kurzweil's singularity (or Harlan Ellison's I-Have-No-Mouth-But-I-Must-Scream reality altering hypercomputer) is they 1) ignore carrying capacity, and 2) rely on boot-strapping or sky-hooking. Ray Kurzweil expected exponential growth, but that could only happen if he had an infinite amount of human brains to throw at the problem. The total number of human brains that are dedicated to a problem means that your exponential curve turns into an S-curve. There's only so many brains.That's problem No.1, and it's not insurmountable if you have software augmentation or boot-strapping, which is problem No. 2. The problem with boot-strapping (the other article of faith for the Rapture of the Nerds crowd) is that you need to know how to build the next smarter brain. Because if you can't do that (and, looking around, I don't see anyone doing that, simply because we don't how to build our brains), you don't get to bootstrap to the next level, and so on, and so on.The latest angst is based upon the fact that we slowly getting better at machine learning and intelligence. We are finally aping the tried-and-true biological approach and it shows promise. The problem is the press gives us the impression that some ice dam has broken, and all the futile efforts at creating AI have finally found fruit (ignoring the fact that people in the computer sciences field have been doggedly and ponderously plugging away at this dreary drudge since, well, the late 1950s - it's just that we were all promised flying cars and HAL the computer ten years ago).But the fact of the matter is, SIRI and self-driving google cars, Big Blue, and Jeopardy-playing Watsons, and autonomous drones notwithstanding, general intelligence, the kind of intelligence that has been displayed by brains mostly much smaller than ours (pretty much any mammal, but if you want specific names, corvids, monitor lizards, primates, dolphins, whales, etc.) is, and will for some time, continue to be out of the realm of this particular endeavor.I would never say never, because I know there is a shitload of stuff piling up in the left field bleachers that will eventually come spilling disruptive technology into our lives (quantum computers, for example), and probably sooner rather than later, but I do think it is a much, much harder problem than the hackers think it is.Unless, you know, you exploit some type of heuristic exploratory problem-solving method using trial and error with real life situations in an embodied biosynthetic brain encased in an artificial body. But that's so 2001."},

Not surprising.I have also noticed that I have less wind, even though I have run all my life. Indeed, it was probably the running that kept my lungs open all those years. On the minus side, I now experience altitude sickness. I never experienced that when I smoked, even at 10-12,000 feet above sea level, and smoking a cigarette up there. I supposes it because all that tar in my lungs and scarring of the alveoli had me living at 10,000 feet all the time - even when I was at sea level. I no longer have that advantage.Smelling, I can smell things I would prefer not to now. My pee, for example. Oh sure, there was always the obvious smell of asparagus pee. (And the interesting thing is I was told there are two kinds of people in the world: those who can and those who cannot smell asparagus pee. I had a girlfriend who could not smell her asparagus pee, even though I could. It's actually more complicated than that).When I eat chinese food with soy sauce, later my pee smells like wood smoke. When I drink beer, my pee will smell like a pine forest. When I eat peanut butter, my pee will smell like peanuts. Coffee, coffee. Etc. Should I be worried? A quick google search tells me that if the odor of my urine corresponds with foods I recently ate, in most case I shouldn't worry.But the whole excretion thing got me back onto metabolism and cycles and biology. More specifically economics with respect to biology.Here's the deal. My shit is someones else's gold. It's not obvious, but it's still true. And not just my bodily wastes (as glamorous and unrestrained as my nose may make them out to be) , but more importantly my life wastes. All my garbage and stuff, that I, as a good little self-replicating robot, churn out. As Paul Krugman has pointed out many times, your spending is my income, and vice versa. So, what's the excretory portion of the economy?Well, one thing I'm, thinking, and it's not a new thought, that if we ever get to the point where we are really good at joining the end points of the circle of consumption, where the lifetime of the product includes, not proper disposal, but best repurposing or re-use, we are probably going to need an energy efficient  industrial strength disintegrator.Joe Haldeman touched on it in his novel Mindbridge, where he noted that what was needed for space colonization was industrial strength mass spectrometer. Eh, same thing. Joe had the advantage of controlled fusion for his device, so garbage was easy to recycle, kind of like Mr. Fusion in Back to the Future.I'm thinking more along the lines of current technologies with crushers and shredders, and then finer and finer shredders and blenders, and then perhaps a lightning chamber to ionize it, and then a magnetic particle track (the mass spectrometer part) that deposits element into separate bins. All you need to do is figure out a way to efficiently power the sucker. I even have terms for the disintegrator. You got the maw, where you throw all your shit in, and then all the stuff in between, and then the plenum, which dumps the cleaned up and separated elements in the bins, which all together, make up a matter bank.The matter bank could be like a big Conex box that ship off to your 3D printer print shop, which, by the way, is not stuck out on the ass-edge of the feed stream, like hip and fashionable Brooklyn, but strategically located in the giant package processing facility of a UPS or a Fedex hub, just like everyone else who does mail order."},
{"title": "Fishing For Paramecia", "date": "Monday, February 4, 2013", "text": "I'd forgotten about Joe Davis. Joe Davis is kind of an artist-in-residence (research affiliate) in the Department of Biology at MIT.The other day I was thinking about sensory interfaces into realms we don't normally get input on, like, say, a microdrone in petri dish, checking up on microscopic life at their level. And then I remembered Joe Davis fishing pole contraption, an interface for fishing for parmecia in a drop of water.And that reminded me of a video I saw one time of a little micro-robot that was controlled by magnetic fields, and in the video, it was bumping into a human cell. Really, you couldn't call it a true robot, not the micro part. That was a just a crude sliver of ferromagnetic material, really not much than a chip of steel controlled by the macro portion of the robot, in turn controlled by a human. And it was an ironic scene indeed, to hear the news announcer rapturously praising this crude bit of metal, when it was next to a eukaryotic cell whose least complicated minor part was about a million times more sophisticated.And that reminded me about Eric Drexler's grey goo, and how everyone was worried that - should nanotechnology reach an advanced stage - self-replicating robots would start feeding on their surrounds and multiply their numbers until the whole of the Earth was consumed by this \"grey goo\", as Drexler called it. Drexler has since admitted the fear of the grey goo scenario was unlikely, and sure enough that's true.I mean, let's face it, when you get your nanotechnology sophisticated enough to self-replicate, and metabolize, then you enter the realm of biology. Biology, here on Earth, is a four billion-year-old proven, robust, hardy nanotechnology which would, quite frankly hand Drexler's grey goo its shredded ass back, should it come to that.The self-replicating robots are already here, and they own Drexler.Of course, Drexler's scenario relied heavily on hand-waving. Somehow the self-replicating robots were able to turn carbon into a diamondoid material, which somehow they extracted from the carbon of living things. Thing is, though, he didn't, or wouldn't, specify exactly how this happened. But one thing we do know, it takes energy to extract and build. It takes chemistry to do all that, and I'm kind of betting that Drexler's chemistry is not quite up to speed with Nature's.Combine that with the concept that these little self-replicators are generalists, kind of Swiss Army Knife  chemical processors. If you've ever used a Swiss Army Knife, you know it may be good for everything, but it is not particularly good at anything. And Nature has come (because of the cost involved in building connections) of modular specialist processes and creatures. And the creatures in turn cooperate to a degree that is deadly efficient. These hardy little rugged individualists love to form consortiums and divvy up the hard labor - with one critter specializing in one task, and relying upon others for other tasks. This community of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryia work quite well together, and are usually ready to consume any and all comers. Unless Drexler is ready to come up with his one self-supporting community of self-replicating robots, I really don't see how they have the slightest chacne of competing.What's the point of this? Not really sure, just thinking about community lately. Society. How we all depend upon each other, and how it makes us - together - ready to take on all comers."},
{"title": "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre", "date": "Wednesday, January 30, 2013", "text": "The current  news cycle features guns and Mexicans. Thus the title, by association. Mexicans, of course, include everyone affected by the coming immigration reform. I'll get to that in a minute.As to guns? I think I've made it clear how I feel about guns. I have no problem with guns. I have no problem with me handling guns. I have a huge problem with you handling guns. 'You' being your average American, who, in the course of the usual gun-play is not only a terrible shot, but can barely handle the task of adequately wiping his own well-fed visibly spreading buttocks, so why on Earth would I trust him to handle a gun? Unless, of course, he's gotten safety training, a license, and insurance. That would be the least amount of responsibility I would inconvenience the American gun owner. Owning a gun is, ultimately, personal responsibility, right? So, let's show some.\"Wages? I don't need your stinking wages!\"As to immigrants, I think we are at a stage where we will see current ironies heaped upon historical ones. Traditionally, Americans will shirk hard labor if they can. If they can find someone to do all their dirty work for practically nothing they will. The sources doesn't matter much. For quite some time we (some of us, I use the general we) enjoyed the benefits of chattel slavery, but peasants from Europe or Asia or south of the border would do in a pinch.This is not to say all white Americans are lazy good-for-nothings, but as a general rule of thumb, do seem to be at about an eighth-grade level when it comes to applying themselves. It must be the inherent anti-intellectualism, or perhaps just our deep-seated viciousness (that we inherited honestly from the Neolithic cultural package).But I can't help but notice how many American citizens are so very upset that all these wetbacks and beaners are going to be cut some slack, even though they've 'violated the law', 'haven't played by the rules' are 'criminal elements sucking up our social services', 'taking away all our jobs', etc. Basically, the polite question, as polite as it could be phrased from a redneck would be: \"Why should a person that broke the law and came here illegally not be arrested and deported?\"Well, I think that's the wrong question. The correct question is... Well, let me quote this excerpt first, from Hidden America by Jeanne Marie Laskas. (Actually, if I could, I would quote the whole chapter Hecho En America: Migrant Labor Camp, Cherryfield, Maine):\"...A good raker with strong rhythm averages one hundred boxes (of blueberries) a day. At $2.25 a box, it's not uncommon to see a weekly check for $1,350. Compare that with just $375 a week picking Georgia peaches, or $400 down in the orange groves of Florida.   Washington County, occupying the far eastern tip of the state, is where the majority of the blueberry barrens are located, and it has 12.2 percent unemployment, the highest in the state. And yet the money does not draw the local unemployed into the fields - an inexplicable dimension to the new American dream repeated nationwide. Raking is hard, backbreaking, and the sun is hot. Just a generation ago, the harvest was a community effort. A ritual that brought out all the locals to the barrens...The locals no longer do the raking...The migrant workers I spoke to were well aware of the disconnect: they labored to support a culture they had virtually no part in, for people who had no part in theirs. \"Now, you see everyone here is brown\", said Noel, Consuelo's brother-in-law, one morning in the barrens. \"When I first came here in 1998, there were white people raking blueberries. None now. White people got lazy and let the Spanish take over. White people are lazy.\"So, the correct question is, given the increasing difficulty in crossing the border, given the risk to life and limb to get to America, given the heightened risk of deportation, and thus a necessarily longer stay in this alien Northern country, the correct question is \"Why do these people risk their lives to take jobs that soft, fat, lazy, white people like you refuse to take? When did Americans like you \"Real Americans\" become such spoiled pampered wimps?\" Or actually, given that, things south of the border are starting to pick up, Mexico is starting to look like the Aztec Tiger for the Twenty-teens, and it will become increasingly harder to find cheap serf labor to exploit, the answer to the redneck question is \"Well, because you need them more than they need you, you stupid ignorant, fat, lazy redneck\"."},

Hard to get up in the morning. Hard to think. Hard to create. It's hibernation time.Nevertheless I seem to be getting things done. The hardest part of anything is just showing up, so I got that going for me.A few quick things of note. Quinoa (pronounced keen-wa, and yes, I was pronouncing it keen-o-wa until corrected) has impacted my consciousness three times in the past two days. Something similar happened two years ago with ch-ch-ch-chia, which, as it turns out, is a potent high energy drink runners appreciate (see: Born to Run). Quinoa is a pseudo cereal grain developed by the Andeans. It is drought and salt tolerant. When drought and heat make corn, wheat, and soy no longer an option in the American breadbasket, my guess is farmers will turn to quinoa. It appears there may be a fly in the ointment with respect to quinoa. It's popularity is driving prices up, making it hard for indigenous farmers in the Andes to continue eating it. Not when when they can sell it and then purchase pasta and noodles and rice and such. Thus the danger is that they will turn into big fat diabetic slobs like us, and then, once we have a world full of fatties used to eating high on the hog, these types of alternative crops are gone, and the the food crash and lots of hurt. As we all know, there's more than enough food produced for everyone, and if anyone starves, it's not a distribution problem, but a poverty problem. They simply cannot afford to pay for food. Ironic then, that some people who recently couldn't get enough and now get more than enough of the wrong kinds of food. Weird.Other things. I simply don't understand why we waste so much time on Mars. Look, I don't have a problem sending probes and robots to Mars, but quit blowing smoke up my ass about how there might have been life there. Mars has been, always has been, dead as hell. If you think about the evolution of the sun it was 30% less bright at the beginning of its history. Even with greenhouse gases, Earth barely kept from freezing, and Mars certainly froze early.Let's think for a minute what planet would have been nice and balmy in the early days of the Solar  System? Why, Venus of course.  If life got started early, Venus would be the place. In fact, we are probably Venusians. Too bad we can't study Venus's early history the way we can Mars. But Venus sucks now. So, like the drunk looking for his lost keys under the streetlight because he can see better there, we send probes to Mars.My brother mailed me his HTC Incredible phone which is now obsolete.

Oh, Joy.Maybe I can operate drones with it (considering this seems to be one of the unintended consequences of the smartphone mobile technological development).Lastly, I've a partial new inventory of mechanicules to cast:And I'm working on the rewards for my Kickstarter project. One of my student aides (who by the way operates a business selling drinking horns), has run a successful funding project on Kickstarter. She is now my advisor. It's kind of funny how she gets frustrated with my glacially slow mental capabilities, and can't seem to understand why my 55-year-old brain doesn't just pick immediately on what she is saying. All I can provide in my defense is, it will happen to her someday, and, yes, my brain was pretty fucking fast on the quick draw when it was nineteen like hers.In any, case, she has proven a valuable resource in putting my little cost-benefit analysis together re: rewards. I am turning out rewards soon, and then slap the whole project together, hopefully get it out by the end of February (and she can't understand why I am missing the end of January target date). Here's a sample:I am going for twenty bronze pendants (kind of based upon the mutant gypsy vacuum cleaner mechanicule) for a $35 contribution. Thinking about little cast glass tiles of these as well. Those would probably be $50. Here's a closeup of a pendant, maybe about inch and a half wide. I was trying to understand why I liked them, and then realized they kind of look like Klingon warships:"},

Yesterday, we had subzero (Fahrenheit) temperatures, and, as is my wont when we get this kind of weather, I went out for a walk.It's not a point of pride or anything. It's not about dip-shit stoic macho extreme sport outward bound wilderness braggadocia crap. I'm not going to do the polar bear club thing. I'm not going to jump into ice water naked (although I do like the rush of jumping in a snow bank from a sauna or hot tub, but only if you get to go back into the sauna or hot tub).I'm not going to brag about being a Northern type adapted for the cold, because that's not true. Why, even Siberians and Inuits aren't really adapted for the cold. No one is adapted for the cold. You don't thrive in Arctic conditions. You don't develop an advanced culture or a rich panoply of leisure activities. You merely survive. So, bragging about going out in the cold as an extreme experience is really kind of stupid.No, I think I do it for the novelty, and like people who go on safari in Africa, there's only the suggestion of risk in doing it. (The stupid stuff, I got out of my system as a kid). I go out well prepared, with zero or no risk to my core temperature, and even less to extremity exposure. So, aside from exposure to my face, it was a very comfy walk in subzero temperatures. It was fun. The air was fresh and super sweet. The taste buds embedded in my lungs were having a good time enjoying the minty freshness of arctic air.I can remember when I was a kid, we'd have at least two weeks of subzero weather at this time of year. Now, we are lucky to get a day or two of it. Did I say lucky? There may come a day, sooner rather than later, when temperatures getting to near freezing may be a novelty. Then I guess I'll have to move to Finland."},

I want you to consider signing it. Here's why.When you consider that the $770 billion spent on bailing out Wall Street fat cat's bad wagers could have put the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise - fully stocked, crewed, and fueled to explore the Solar System on a five year mission - into near Earth orbit, then you have to admit that we as a species need to aim for loftier goals than we currently have. Which is, what? Making sure rich people stay rich, I guess.One small portion of the 100,000 Year Project should be having the option open (granted rather a long-shot of an option) for human beings to able to live off planet. One of the requirements for this is some kind of nuclear rocket. The technology is proven, the technology is sound. It can be improved still further so that the risks of a nuclear rocket crash are minimized.There is no such thing as zero risk. No guts, no glory. Like, we should build the Nautilus X, only ten times as big. Maybe fifty times as big, crewed by 300 to go to Jupiter in a month. (I built a scale model of this Pilgrim Observer when I was a kid, and fully expected to crew it when I was an adult. Silly me.)I say go for it. What say you?"},

I had to get glasses, My eyes were getting bad.I've always had good eyesight. Like, eagle eye, fighter pilot, astronaut kind of eyesight. Most everyone goes through the nearsighted phase, the cheaters at 40 phase, and I did as well. But I never figured I would need glasses. Well, my last road trip down to Indiana convinced me to get some glasses. Road signs were getting blurry, even from a short distance.So, off to the eye doctor. He had read the chart, and no, I had no problem reading the tiniest line. But then he had me use just one eye, and when I covered my left and used my right... Holy Cow! I couldn't even read the third line of five! All this time, my miraculously complex visual cortex had been compensating. I guess that's why it occupies nearly a third of your brain, to do all that fantastic visual magic that allows to see the world seamlessly.So, $435!!!! dollars later, I got glasses. Now I look like a grandpa. It's strange and takes some getting used to. Like living in a fishbowl. I actually felt a little queasy for a bit. And I can't wear my glasses too close to my face, because my lovely long lashes brush up against the lenses. And I'm obviously a vain person, because I seem to be the only that notices I have glasses now.On the plus side, I can see again. I'm back to my old driving habit of driving a mile ahead of me (because now I can see a mile ahead of me), and I am surprised at how closed in my world had gotten.Wow.

{"title": "More 2013 Prognostications: A Lot of Negativity", "date": "Friday, January 4, 2013", "text": "Most people do not understand the power or the process of the third derivative, let alone the second.Let me explain. In calculus, you have these things called derivatives which take the pulse of mathematical equations. The briefest example is motion.Something standing still at a position X on an x-axis at time T on the t-axis is said to be, by Newton and probably Leibniz, at rest. Were we to figure out it's velocity, which is the first derivative of it's equation of motion, it would be zero. The first derivative, velocity, is nothing more than the change of position during some duration, often denoted as dx/dt. If we push this something, so that suddenly it is moving, we have accelerated it, and this is the second derivative - the change of velocity over time.Right then and there we should pause for a moment. An example of acceleration is gravity, which, through the mystery of the Almighty, or random chance, acts uniformly over all things within it's force field. And thus, under airless conditions, a hammer and a feather will fall accelerate at the same rate.What else accelerates? Well, it turns most every process that involves even the slightest external force - nonlinear external force - will have some acceleration in it. And when the slightest external force provides just the right little touch, you get what is called an inflection point, or a tipping point to you Malcolm Gladwell fans.Okay, next up, the third derivative. If acceleration is the change of the change, then the third derivative, called \"jerk\" or \"jolt\" or \"surge\" or \"lurch\" is the change of the change of the change of position.  If you've ever ridden a rollercoaster, or suffered whiplash in a car accident, you understand the third derivative.The fourth derivative, the change of the change of the change of the change, is called \"jounce\". The fifth and sixth are called \"crackle\" and \"pop\", and the seventh and eighth are called \"lock\" and \"drop\". Humorous and whimsical as all these sound, you definitely do not want to experience them, considering a hefty application of even the second derivative can turn you to jelly.What's the fucking point here?Well, let's talk about climate change for a second. I can tell you right off that, unlike Joseph interpreting Pharaoh's dreams, I don't have no lean cows eating fat cows to use as a visual to interpret. All I got is pictures of lost ice and spreading desert. Neither is particularly sufficient to justify a trend. And I am a little leery of trend analysis. But, looking at the data, I have to conclude that a second derivative is now in full operation global climate wise, and probably we can expect a third derivative operation before the decade is out.How bad you ask? Well, depends, and depends upon the slightest of external forces.  But now it appears that the Big Squeeze is underway. People notice, to pick one place, the increasing urbanization of Africa. There is good reason for this, and only partly due to the attraction of big city life.The Kalahari seems to have decided to move south and east. The Sahara (and Sahel) seems to have decided to move north. Good for Nigeria and the Congo, not so good for Spain, Italy, and Greece, but I can't have sympathies (for now) for a place so distant. I've said before that the US Southwest is screwed, and that's seems to be a given, and that is a moderate concern if only because all of the reverse Okies, the displaced pampered snowbirds and rednecks will soon annoy all the rest of us Yankees and Canucks.But the Big Squeeze is firmly in place now, what with drought areas heading north, and ice melting up north. Good for people who invest in hoverbarge stock, but not so good for people who think they can just migrate north in the upper latitudes to get away from the lack of water. Once all that ice melts, once that permafrost is water, that's all swamp and mud. No place to live, son, not with all those giant sub-Arctic mosquitoes now carrying malaria.So, gonna be unpleasant for some people. Me, as an ice ape, being one of them. Especially when that third derivative kicks in. My guess? No land ice in fifty years. No permanent ice caps in fifty years. Sea level rise of forty feet in one decade. All the disaster movie stuff that your vengeful little heart could desire.I'm probably wrong. I hope I'm wrong. But I got a feeling I just have a hard time shaking. But, to be on the safe side, I'll flip a coin.Heads. Ah! Nothing to worry about. Everything will be fine. Or at least no worse than the Eemian."},
{"title": "2013 Prognostications", "date": "Wednesday, January 2, 2013", "text": "Happy New Year everyone! Hope you had as good a holiday as I did. I got to see family and friends, friends that are family, and had a spa experience to boot. The only fly in the ointment is the post-holiday blahs, looking at the long stretch of cold, dark, grey winter ahead. But it's only bad when I think  of it that way. Before I know it, it will be late winter, which is tolerable, at least. And, on the bright side of things, the short day is behind us, and the days are getting longer.Forgive if this essay is disjointed or incomplete. I've a limited time window for typing, and this is all worst than first draft stuff here. Don't even get a chance to think.In any case, I'm thinking about what's in store for 2013. I pride myself on being hip, but as it turns out, that's a false conceit. I haven't been hip since at least 1977, if then, and probably for about two weeks. (I was also beautiful then, which was good). But I do try to follow trends, or predict them, but the thing I am interested in is not the obvious trends, but the game changers, the things coming out of left field. My record is about as good as a coin flip. There are a number of things piling up in the left field bleachers that should spill out and, I guessing maybe this year.Various people are predicting this as the year of 3D Printing. I've noticed it for about five years. It really popped into my consciousness just this past year, what with Makerbot, and the Thingiverse, and Shapeways on the acceleration curve. Which means, since I am not hip, that 2012 was teh year of the 3D printer. Now, I don't think these things will end up on desktops. I do think you will start to see franchises like copycenters opening up. I still don't understand why there is not a 3D printer facility at the UPS and Fedex hubs in Louisville and Memphis. But I'm betting this year there will be, because...Logistics, logistics, logistics! This is the year of all things logistic. You are going to be tired of that word when the giant comet arrives next this December. Because things are picking up, and things and materiel gotta be moved around.I am predicting the World Go Boom. Economically speaking. A two pronged boom has been occuring and will accelerate. You got the developing world boom, and it is quite something. The beauty and problem with that is that you get only a one-time boom when a coutnry goes through development. So, the problem is doing it right the first time out. It's not going to happen in most places. (Not that there aren't still plenty of places to go boom. Myanmar is looking promising, but then what? I don't know). The second prong is the convergence of cheap robots (Rodney Brook's Baxter looks like a winner), Internet coordinations (by what Bruce Sterling calls \"the Stacks\", but there is hope open-source still can blossom), and finally we get to use all that fiber optics that have been laid down. So the second boom is developed world automation - again.But don't count out leveraged booms. I'm guessing cheap solar continues to get cheaper, and the logical place for that is the developed world. So once again, I call ou attention to Africa. Maybe this is the year wher saying \"It's Africa, stupid\" comes true.So, believe it or not, despite all the horseshit, I don't see how things can't improve economy-wise.(The coin came up tails, by the way)."},

{"title": "The 100,000 Year Project Continued", "date": "Monday, December 17, 2012", "text": "When it comes to long term survival, a nation that kills its babies probably won't last.Not that I think the US of A is crucial to the 100,000 Year Project - dedicated, I suppose, to the successful commensal solution to the problem of humans and Earth. Far from it. This nation has probably done less towards some type of solution than most, but since I live here, I feel it's my personal responsibility to deal with things here.Now, this isn't an attempt to be a drama queen about what happened at Newtown, Connecticut. I'll leave the drama queen tactics to the unrestricted gun rights crowd, which seems to be doing a very good job of looking stupid. More on that in a minute.I think James Fallows of the Atlantic Monthly serves us all well by stressing that the long-term problem is not a gun control issue, not a gun rights issue, not a gun ownership issue, not a 2nd Amendment issue.This is a gun usage issue. This is a public health and safety issue, and should be treated as such.I could go through the numbers, through all the statistics, to show that this nation is insane, like the number of children killed by gunfire is 25 times higher than the next 20 largest industrial nations combined. Horrifying shit like that. But what the statistics show, worldwide, is that guns don't kill people. Americans do.I would, however; point out an interesting correlation which Mark Reid has also noticed. Look at gun ownership rates by country. America is Number 1, with 88 guns per 100 people. Next is Yemen, with 50 guns per 100 people. Rounding out the top 10 is Serbia, Switzerland, Cyprus, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Finland, Uruguay, Sweden.Now look at gun fatalities per country. America is 12th with nine eleven fatalities per one hundred thousand people. Serbia is 20th, with 3.9 fatalities. Yemen, pretty much an ongoing war zone, is barely a tenth that. Switzerland is 16th, with 3.5/100K.  Of the other top ten, only Finland and Sweden make it into the whole numbers. Sure, sure, there are a lots of countries with much higher fatality rates than the US, but the fact is, in comparison with the rest of the developed world, we should more properly be lumped in with the \"primitive\" nation states such as El Salvador and Swaziland than the OECD countries like Japan, or England, or France.So, what to do about it? What we know won't work is trying to get rid of guns. Oh, it's true. No guns - no gun deaths. That is a fact that gun rights advocates choose to ignore. But in the US of A, with the 2nd Amendment not going anywhere, as a practical solution, it ain't gonna happen. But I would like to see us use that useless qualifier at the beginning of the 2nd Amendment, you know, the stuff before the comma? Most importantly the phrase \"well regulated\"?I would note that the Supreme Court, in its ruling on gun ownership, stated that many \"reasonable restrictions\" can be put into place that do not violate the 2nd Amendment. I would also note that every single one of these restrictions do not limit the right to bear arms. They merely inconvenience gun owners, because they put restrictions on gun usage. Well, lawmakers, it's time to start slapping those restrictions in place, and with a generous hand, and give up on the empty gestures.Here's some of my ideas. Taxes. Insurance. Licensing and Training. Stricter gun abuse laws. Gun provenance. A model something along the lines of the way we regulate alcohol and tobacco (and notice Firearms are conveniently lumped in under that agency?).Taxes. Rather than fees, an annual tax per gun per person to be tied to income, thus making it progressive (and putting to rest the objection that taxation would make guns available only to the rich). I would suggest a fairly high tax percentage, on the order of, say, 2% of income for lower brackets, up to 90% of income for the upper quintile. The rates are open to discussion, but whatever it takes to make gun usage inconvenient is fine with me.Licensing and Training. It's my opinion, that a citizen with a carry and conceal permit is more dangerous than a criminal, and little better than a rogue cop, and certainly should be held to a higher accountability than the equivalent public servant. A conceal and carry citizen certainly seems to be granted the same authority as a cop, and ought to be held to the same high standards of responsibility. My own personal experiences is that the average American - aside from being a disgusting soft-body in no condition to defend anyone - is not only a terrible shot, but more of a threat to him- or herself and innocent bystanders than to any armed intruders or criminal perpetrators. The insane paranoia we have about imaginary predators and violators of private property does not correspond to the statistics. As such, conceal and carry permit carriers should at least engage in once-a-year police-level pistol examinations, and preferably a live fire exercise (at the owner's cost of course). Should they make it through the training, they get their license renewed for another year. Licensing would also include a hefty fee for background checks, psychological examinations,  random drug testing of all registered owners, examination of threat levels via accessibility through social and familial connections, etc.Insurance. Car insurance is mandatory in most states, and includes costs for injury to others. I'm sure something equivalent could be offered to gun owners, and I see no reason why most states would not make it mandatory. In fact, I think quite a few insurance companies would be more than happy to offer such a policy - with competitive rates, of course.Gun abuse laws. Currently there are some strict gun usage laws on the books. I would encourage law-makers to make them even more stringent. It really is a pity that the whole \"cruel and unusual\" 8th amendment language gets in the way. I don't think that having your genitals removed or mutilated (or limbs, or ears, or eyes, or maybe even a few vital severed nerves) will deter gun crime, but I don't see how such measures could in any way encourage gun use in crimes. I do think the punishments should be as close to insane as the 8th amendment allows.Gun Provenance. There are any number of items far less harmful than firearms that require an audit trail. Artworks, famous ones at least, have a provenance, a documentation of prior ownership, attached to them. If art, why not guns? If a gun is stolen, doesn't it make sense to have the equivalent of a Lo-jack to track it? If you buy a gun at a gun show, wouldn't you like to know it's not stolen, and possibly used in a homicide? If provenance isn't possible, then how just eliminating or severely restricting gun shows and straw purchases? I can hear howls of protest right now from overgrown babies cut off from their toys. But don't you think it's about time we quit treating guns like toys in America?You might think I'm being glib about this. I'm not. If gun related fatalities can be reduced by only 10,000 per year, or at least maybe go just one year without any babies being murdered, I don't see how gun owners can object to suffering even the slightest inconveniences.========================================================================Gun owners, please avoid using false equivalence arguments such as \"cars kill people too\". Cars are not designed for the sole purpose of killing things. That's the only purpose for a gun. Please also avoid the combined strawman/excluded middle fallacy about how \"prohibition doesn't work\". By using this asshole argument, you put stupid ideas into the heads of others that don't need to be there. Also, please avoid the whole \"against tyranny\" horseshit. It barely passed muster in the 18th century here in the US, and it is completely obsolete in the age of a swarm of unmanned grenade drones with facial recognition software bearing down on your vacuous, gaping slackjawed mug.

{"title": "The 100,000 Year Project", "date": "Tuesday, November 27, 2012", "text": "DD has proposed a grand vision which I support. He hasn't given it a name, but I will:The 100,000 Year Project.The goal? Human survival for starters? Not that we deserve it. Part of the goal is to somehow ennoble our species enough that we do deserve to survive. Not fucking up the planet more than we have might be a start.I know. I know. George Carlin is right.The planet doesn't need to be saved. The Earth wanted plastic. And maybe now we are done.If you like your cake without sprinkles, take the sprinkles off, and you still have plenty of cake and frosting. Those sprinkles are multicellular life. All the animals and plants including us. We should save ourselves first. Learn to behave like adults, like, well, not like the We Are Wall Street asshole, who, honestly, makes the idea of a project for developing a vaster-than-empires-and-more-slow hypercomputer that can upload a human mind, and then torture the uploaded mind in a surrealistic virtual Hell, kind of like the splatter genre of Superjail, sounds like not such a bad waste of taxpayer monies.In any case, we are, as a species, approaching or already at a force of nature. We move as much earth as a quarter of all the Earth's rivers. We use more than 30% of the fresh water resources. As just one example, we have deforested 16% of the Amazon basin in a mere 30 years. As fire ants go, we're doing pretty good at disturbing habitats. If we want to survive as a species, we need to work on our domestic habits.Problem: I don't know about you, but too often, I get absorbed into my life and start to think the whole fucking universe revolves around me, when, in fact, even the the briefest check outside my tiny little head would reveal that there's a hardly even a trace of a virtual particle to my existence. And that's not even counting the wasted time. Me? I can't go much more than twenty minutes without getting distracted by something. When you work it out, that twenty minute granularity comes out to just a little over 1% OF A DAY. Twenty minutes out of 100,000 years is .0000000380518 percent. That doesn't even mean anything to me. I don't think there is even a term for 100,000 years. Centumillenium? In any case, what I'm saying here is, if someone gonna get this project going, it will have to be someone with a lot of patience - in other words, someone female. (Have we had any female saviors? And no need to sacrifice them. No. Maybe we should try it out, because, The White Goddess notwithstanding, I don't think we've ever had a female centric culture outside the immortal obsession for pussy. I'm not saying we should have a female run culture, because we all know they are even more vicious than men. I'm saying maybe we try out a less pastoral horses and bronze swords basis for civilization).But wait a minute. There are cave paintings that span at least 50,000 years, with handprints five thousand years apart. You telling me we can't start a tradition that our ancestors kept going for half the project length?Another problem: Religion. Look, it's not religion per se that is the problem. That's one of my beefs with that bonehead Richard Dawkins. It's not religion. It's the ideological abuse that's the problem. Religion is neither necessary nor sufficient for shitty behaviors of people against each other. If we can figure out some system of fidelity, some way that the message and the goal can avoid mission creep, we might stand a chance at coming up with a strong and robust, self-correcting philosophy, or a heuristic, or an aesthetic, that can last 100,000 years.In that area? Um. I got nothing. Save the Barbarian Aesthetic. Regardless of whether you Believe or not, you can still hold things sacred. You don't need to believe in God. But you do need to get back to the Indo-European root of belief: leubh-, which is loving, caring, and desiring all at once. And coveting. And holding things sacred.Stil another problem: Lifestyle changes. I suspect, in order to get everyone over the hump, some people will live less lavishly, others much , much more so, and probably, at the start a little Hobbesian persuasion will be in order. But if it means a free Harvard or Stanford or technical education via tablets to all of the world's youth, unlocking the potential of all those brains, I don't see how that can be a bad thing."},
{"title": "Deep Logistics", "date": "Monday, November 26, 2012", "text": "Logistics deals with the procurement, maintenance, and transportation of materials, facilities, and personnel (or their telepresented talents and skills). Although traditionally a military activity, logistics is the now way of the future. College degrees are now offered in logistics. Even in the digital age, where designs and information are piped via wires and airwaves, materials are still used. If materials are used, materials will need to be moved from places of plenty to places of scarcity. My suspicion is, since I agree with Landauer's Principle that Information is Physical, even if we ever become some type of Star Trek pure energy beings, logistics will still be with us. After all, even the consciousness of a pure energy being will need to be housed in pure energy, a kugelblitz of some kind, or more likely, a zusammenbindenkugelblitz. In any case, what with the developed world's obsession with modularity resulting in commodification being turned into a value-added process resulting in plug'nplay factories for the developed world, logistics will be with us for basically forever. Couple this with the notion of a consumption cycle equivalent to the hydrological cycle, and you can see how the movement of materials, facilities, and personnel (or their telepresented talents and skills) is the way of the future.Logistics, obviously, is ancient, known to go back to the title of \"logistickas\" for military officers in the Greek and Roman empires, but an activity far older, as old as for however long men have mimicked ants. Only recently has the empirical art taken on some aspects of science, back to perhaps the 19th century methods of time and motion studies, forward to when models using linear equations were domesticated, now advanced to virtual worlds of contingency planning on supercomputers, used by both industry and government, and manifested in such processes as just-in-time manufacturing.These attempts to produce hyper-efficient - yet exceedingly brittle - networks of instrumentalities I would neologize as \"shallow logisitics\". And in today's plutonomy, our current flavor of capitalism based upon the Anglo-American metastasizing tumor method of capitalization, where the economic goals are as short-sighted as the end of a fat plutocrat's short dick, shallow works quite well - until things go boom (which apparently happens every five to seven years and you should just fucking get used to it).Actually, I think we've moved into fire-ant capitalism - evidenced, for example, by Naomi Klein's book The Shock Doctrine, or Chrystia Freeland's book on Plutocrats - of moving beyond mere creative destruction into the realm of deeply disturbed environmental rapine and slaughter.So, it is time to use those supposedly well-developed frontal lobes, and start looking a bit further ahead. It's time to develop Deep Logistics. Deep logistics is really no different from the shallow kind, the same methods and processes are used, but instead it is more of an attitude. A Deep Time attitude. Deep Logistics is the adoption of adult self-restraint, the pursuit of the \"long-term greed\" that characterized the behavior at Goldman Sachs from, say, 1969 through 1976, under Gus Levy.Fact is, we are rapidly becoming a welfare planet. By this I mean, the Anthropocene is here, has been here at least since the extinction of the megafauna some 40-50,000 years go, certainly since the advent of pastoral and agricultural practices some 12-15,000 years, most definitely from the accelerating mass extinction events with the arrival of industrial manufacturing and agriculture. Like it or not, because of our meddling, any pristine unpeopled area of Earth no longer exists, and in fact, any so-called \"natural\" area, such as Yellowstone, is even more artificial and carefully managed than the Exclusion Zone around Chernobyl. (I happen to agree with Paul Wapner in his book Living Through the End of Nature, in which he comes to essentially the same conclusion - like it or not, as the apex predator in the natural world, mankind is now kind of stuck with the world as it is, and the best we can hope for is to at least arrive at a state of minimal impact).People seem to think that, when it comes to economics, an either-or fallacy exits of either Capitalism or Communism, either anarcho-marketing illogic and inefficiencies or the static and dead crystallization of  central planning. I'm pretty sure there are at least 33 flavors of either system, and quite a bit of blending as well (indeed, few people seem to realized just how much central planning is involved in capitalism, and how much competition can occur in a communal environment). But the historical sticking point in either system has been the frontier mentality espoused by the main players - Russia and the United States. Both were presented with a bizarre and anomalous condition, resulting in abnormal and aberrant psychotic mass behaviors, of free land and labor, or exceedingly cheap land and labor. As such, like the little fire ant graced the present of a depopulated landscape, both systems entered the lowest-common-denominator regime of easy rewards, microscopic attention spans, juvenile behavior, and that curious criminality known as the tyranny of the infant.The problem is not the behaviors per se. After all, biological life is exploitative, punishment averse and reward seeking. The problem is the time span. If we can somehow modify our behaviors before circumstances dictate our responses, we stand a small chance of not just surviving, but surviving in a livable environment. And the only sliver lining in what seems to be the inevitable crash is the delight in knowing that the Wall Street plutocrats and their minions (their delusional self-image not withstanding) will be the most ill-equipped to live in a dystopian Road Warrior future - first to whine, first to be smacked in the mouth and told to shut the fuck up, first to starve, first to be eaten, first to be made into lampshades. I say this with great confidence when, considering they can barely handle holding their bladder when they \"don't get up to take a pee while holding a position\", they are at a severe disadvantage to people in Guiyu, the People's Republic of China, who willing to expose their children to widespread lead poisoning in order to recycle circuit boards for the gold they contain. Or to Mexican line workers in chicken flensing factories in the Southeast- where they have vending machines filled with painkillers. Or even, a blue-collar working girl I know who had her fingers pinched off, sewn back on, and returned to work the next day. Quite simply, you pussified, short-sighted Wall Street trader asshole, you're name in China, or Indonesia, or Africa, or Brazil, or roughneck North America is \"Breakfast\". The only way to change things is to start including the welfare of other people in your seriously fucked-up solipsist's nightmare of a world. Because, so far, there's no reason for them to think charitably about you.(I'm not really sure how this ended up being a diatribe against some silly little puffed up cocksucking Wall Street rooster boy dickshit, but this is a random walk, so...)"},
{"title": "Equal But Opposite", "date": "Monday, November 19, 2012", "text": "There is a man at the college that is the size of a one-year-old baby. He rides on a scooter, but still needs assistance. I know he is a man who is the size of baby, because he needs a shave - probably purposefully so.This type of shit, along with Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome, makes me think that those who believe in loving, personal God have their work cut out for them. They will say that this, all this, all this cruelty in the world is part of God's Divine Plan. That somehow, gifting people with abnormalities, or granting people indignities such as hemorrhoids, or zits, or any of the hundreds of other bodily indignities we spiritual beings trapped in the physical  must endure, God insures that his inscrutable machinations shall all eventually come to pass.And, given that the Almighty is all-knowing, and not just knowing what has, is, and shall come to pass, but all the plenitudinous multiplicities of never was, cannot be, and shall not, it makes the planning a tad even more ridiculous looking to us limited humans. Even more so if you consider that the whole point of the plan, at least as the tale was told to me, is to triumph over evil. Evil - still another divine creation.At least, if you go with the Judeo-Christian interpretation of reality, that seems to be the plan. That makes the whole point of existence all the more silly, for Lucifer, Satan, Mephistopheles, being the loving creation of an all-knowing and all-powerful deity is just a puppet playing out a pre-programmed role. Not even worthy of a Greek tragedy, then, just a sad little corner masturbation of a yarn. Which makes, well, me at least, wish that the contest was a bit more on a level playing field. Something more in the philosophy of Manes of Persia, the prophet who envisioned Manicheanism, a vision where the world is a fusion of equal but opposite forces of good and evil.Perhaps, with the proper rationalizations, this more dramatic, or less melodramatic, vision of existence can be folded into Christianity like chocolate chips into cookie dough.After all, the popular myth goes that Lucifer was the first and best of the angelic host, beloved of God until the rebellion. Various accounts exist as to why Lucifer rebelled, was cast out of heaven and took the name of Satan, but my guess would be that the best way to turn a son against a father is for the father to abandon him. That is the major cause of more than one unruly son's bad behavior: a theme that can be summarized with the question of: Where's Dad?Perhaps Lucifer, abused by neglect, started to hang with the wrong crowd. He started getting involved in scrapes with the law, hanging out with unsavory characters, engaging in underage drinking, selling bags of weed and speed and acid, and sampling the product. Hanging out in punker clubs and vandalizing local retail establishments. Spending a few years in juvenile correctional facilities, coming out angrier and stronger, and, what with the street fighting and skateboarding, and lifting weights and doing pushups, becoming buff and hard and tough and ready - ready to take on the world.And so he goes out, and finds the Old Man, and confronts him. And the Old Man, he may be only slightly older than Lucifer, but he's old enough. And here's this tough, young punk, lightning-fast and wiry, and beatifically nimble-footed, up against a guy who's a lot bigger, but also a lot slower, and paunchy and elephant stumpy on his feet. But the Old Man, he's got the old man strength, all those fast twitch muscle fibers gone by the wayside, but replaced with inexorably horrific, glacially powerful slow-twitch muscles. And the Old Man, he may not have the stamina, but he's got the endurance. He's inured to agony from so many chronic aches and the pain of everyday aging. Doesn't matter if the kid lands claw hammer blows to the belly, it's like pummeling hard clay. And forget about face punches, smacking that jaw, why, the kid might as well be hitting be the blade of a bulldozer. So that's not gonna do it. His one option is to wear the Old Man down by getting him to move, getting him to dance, and so he keeps just in range, just within the circle of punishment, but dodge, and feint, and meet those sledgehammer blows so that they glance and slide off the hard edges of his body, using the soft motions to turn the hard forces into wasted energy.But the Old Man, he's seen all this before, and then some. He knows the both the kid's moves and more important the moves kid doesn't have. Even so, it's a prolonged and bloody fight, and after a while He realizes He relishes the thumping He's receiving. He takes pleasure in the pain of a particularly amped up kick or strike. He feels a paternal pride that he couldn't feel any other way. It's a maker's pride in this magnificent creature that wishes to destroy Him, seasoned with a delicious primal fear. This beautiful, wild thing that is battering Him, trying to break Him. It may be the most touching moment of Creation He's ever experienced. But like all things, it has to end, and so He summons an All-powerful, a sacrilegiously Unholy, blow and knocks the kid senseless, bright sweat and black blood and perfect teeth spattering and showering all over the good earth. Down, down into smoking hole of fire and brimstone.And God says to himself \"It is good\"."},
{"title": "Succeed Texas", "date": "Wednesday, November 14, 2012", "text": "Originally, I planned this as a treatment for a movie comedy, kind of a madcap misadventure involving the peaceful secession from the Union of the state of Texas.I see it as a vehicle for Bill Murray, or Brad Pitt, or Matthew Mcconaughey, and lots of cameos from all those country music and Hollywood stars, and perhaps formulated loosely on a chase movie like It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. And basically it would be about how Texas secedes, and how every dumb shit \"Go Galt\" asshole in our unfortunately fractalized hillbilly demographic of a nation are all finally concentrated into one solid reptile house of a country.(And, in case you are wondering or haven't figured it out, the 'succeed' part of the title is used because most of the rednecks that have a flipper-limbed Thalidomide baby of a brain squirming around in their barely calcareous skulls are either too fucking stupid, or too fucking lazy (or both), to know how to spell or properly use the word 'secede').And I actually would sell it as a gentle comedy (the danger of a satire about Texas being that it is too easy to remake Idiocracy), only mildly poking fun at the people of Texas, because, honestly, they'all can't help it.But all the others out there in the United States who have petitioned for peaceful secession, all the spoiled brats and crybabies and infants in adult bodies, who, well, in the Age of Information, their ignorance is a choice they should have to live with. And they should be poked fun at as much as good taste will allow.So, the plot would go something along the lines of:- enough Texans and other Americans ask to secede that President Obama finally throws up his hands and says \"You know what? Go for it! It will be interesting to see which philosophy of governing will prevail. We give you and the rest of nation exactly one year to prepare. We will even be generous enough to sell you all Federal land, facilities, and infrastructure for 75 cents on the dollar. With one important proviso! Those who choose to secede can never, ever return to the Union, not as individual citizens or as a collective state.\"- a mad scramble begins on whether to go or stay for the denizens of Texas, on the part of corporations and individuals, and an equally mad, and even more frantic scramble on the part of all those \"Go Galt\" retarded types that exist outside the state of Texas to get safely within the borders before the year is out- Texans, the smart, responsible ones at least, start to get a tad worried when they start to see the horde of individuals only lazily crafted by the Almighty, for all the world starting to look like a mash-up of the Beverly Hillbillies meets the Road Warrior, but with the morbid obesity added, and radiation damage and chronic wasting of frontal lobes- meanwhile the United States of America embarks upon the greatest construction project ever, building the Wall (a border fence that makes the battlements of Mordor look like a hastily-built rubble hedgerow) that will isolate Texas from the rest of the continent forever. (The unemployment rate drops to .5%).- the movie climaxes with the end date of, what? December 18th, 2014. Stone Cold Steve Austin's birthday. Sure, why not? (Empresario Stephen F. Austin, who had a very low opinion of the types of immigrants arriving in the Texas of his day, would appreciate the irony). The closing and sealing of the last gate in the Wall of Mordor surrounding Texas. One lonely and inconsolable arrival, dragging a rebel flag in the dirt, blows his head off when he arrives a minute too late. And then a Marine helicopter dumps quite a few befuddled Senators and Representatives behind the Wall, ala The Marching Morons.- the movie ends with the usual summaries before the credits. The United States goes on to marry Canada, sires a healthy crop of baby colonies on the Moon and Mars. Texas, after some struggle, finds its niche importing big-titted blondes to the Middle East. Mexico, with the influx of spectacular talent from El Norte, becomes successful, and finally gets that siesta it deserves. Or something like that.Although come to think of it, I'm not sure you can make a two hour movie out of this. maybe a Simpson's episode. There's only so many inbreeding and stupid redneck jokes you can use.And then again, the more I think of it, the more I think, this is actually a brilliant fucking idea! Why not let Texas secede? Seems to me it would produce a lot of jobs! Let's make the creative destruction of capitalism work for the consumer for a change!"},
{"title": "Spindletop", "date": "Tuesday, November 13, 2012", "text": "photo courtesy of the American Petroleum InstituteMy class had their bronze pour this past Saturday, which means I sweated off a good ten pounds in between 9am and 3pm. I don't think my heart rate got below 100 the entire time. It's not exactly back-breaking work,  but I felt it the next day. It's not the effort. It's the recovery.There was one incident of note. I insist upon everyone wear safety glasses, and we wear these mesh screen helmet visors as well. But it is more of a \"Do what I say, not what I do\" type of safety regulation. Oftentimes, the glare of the furnace will obscure my vision through sweat-smeared glasses, and so I sometimes take them off.Well, while I was knocking off the dipper after skimming slag off the molten metal, a marble-sized piece of molten slag decides to jump up, ricochet off the inside of my visor, and go into my right eye.Fortunately, it bounced back out, but it burned my eye. In this case, steam was my friend (as in the water on the surface of my eye turned to steam and did a little Leidenfrost effect on the slag bolt). Later investigation found two pea- and pinhead-sized first-degree burns to the upper and lower eyelids, and a little portion of eyelash burned down to the root. But the sclera of my eye was only superficially burned. I mean, I knew it was burned as it started to hurt whenever I re-exposed it to heat, loading up the furnace. So, I just shut that eye when I got near heat.Only one student saw it happen, and wouldn't you know it, she's a nurse. She insisted I go to the emergency room, and I told her I was fine. I wasn't but, I wasn't about to spend five hundred dollars for them to tell me they'd want to keep me under observation. And as it turned out, it only hurt for a few days, and no weird crusty exudate or pus come out of my eye, so I guess I'm okay.But for some reason, it reminded me of a time back in the early 70s driving with the old man through Gary and East Chicago where my eyes felt the same way - stinging. And I had to put my t-shirt over my mouth and nose to try and cut the outside stink down. I overheard my dad later talking to a friend about how he \"had to break wind in the car to improve upon the smell\". That was all before the Clean Air Act, back when the refineries and steel mills generously put your daily mineral requirements out into the atmosphere for consumption.Some drive through that area now, and consider it the armpit of Indiana. Not hardly. Not nearly like what it was.I'm sure other people and places feel the same way. I've never been to Port Arthur, TX, but my understanding is the refinery complex there makes NW Indiana's look like a small time hillbilly still. Port Arthur, I've heard, is a shithole, and like all shitholes, it is what it is because it is strategically placed to be a shithole. Why, just up the road, in Beaumont, is Spindletop.Some 150 million years ago, a shallow portion of Jurassic sea alternately flooded and dried out, building up a seriously thick microbial scuzz, and creating a salt pan of considerable depth. Fast forward through geologic time, with sediment lithifying on top, the scuzz compresses and cooks into oil, the salt starts to float upward through the rock, forming a dome. The salt dome, lighter than the surrounding rock, squeezes up like soft turd, paradoxically breaking the harder rock above it, and all that scuzz-oil leaks upward through the cracks. In the meantime, minerals leaching down from the surface have formed a limestone and gypsum cap above the dome, riddled with caves and caverns that the oil pools up in. Drill down some thousand feet, in just the right spot (plus or minus less than some fifty feet) and you get yourself the famous Lucas Gusher No. 1.Spindletop NowMy understanding is, for a hundred bucks, you can get a replica of that gusher turned on. They use water now to simulate the gusher, but still, that should give you a good idea that that's a lot of oil under a lot of pressure (150 feet in the air, at 100,000 barrels per day), and it is pretty much all floating around in the atmosphere now, combined with oxygen.What's the point of this? Well, look up at that first picture. That's Boiler Avenue, circa 1903. Within a year of the Lucas Gusher, 100 different oil companies fought for space on Spindletop to put down some 200 oil wells. Land speculation was insane.Production was 17,500,000 barrels of oil in 1902. By early 1904, production was down 10,000 barrels a day Not that there wasn't more oil there. By 1985, some 185,000,000 barrels had been sucked out of the whole area. But the point was, with oil cheaper than water, far cheaper than coal, and ready to burn in ships and locomotives, there was no incentive to rationally plan for the future, and modify the speculations and extractions.Sound familiar? The fracked-up Marcellus range of natural gas was originally estimated to be able to supply US natural gas consumption for the next one hundred years. Current estimates are now at a little more than a decade.Current estimates say US oil production will exceed Saudi Arabia by 2020. The United States will be the Number One producer of oil, just like back in 1901. Supposedly this means the United States will be energy independent by 2035.Given our past behaviors, would anyone care to put some serious money on that?"},

It may not have played out quite the way I thought, but, I, like many, many others, was completely confident that he had jumped the shark.In fact, I can't help but be a little appalled at how the Republican leadership sampled their own drugs. Romney looked completely gut-punched on election night. Paul Ryan's toothless ugly old dead-eyed gump face could not have been more contorted in disbelief.If this is the standard reaction these two leaders have to reality, this paradoxically rigid and brittle deflation of their inelastic gas bag egos, then it's a very good thing indeed for the country that they are not in a position to fuck things up further.The fact that the entire campaign was utterly gob-smacked at their defeat suggests that perhaps two new circles should be added to the current swarm of so-called conservative's D-K Venn diagram. How about \"Dangerously stupid\", or perhaps within that circle \"That fable about spinning straw into gold? You knew that was a fable, right? And the joke? That was straw from the stable floor, which is, like, 90%manure! You didn't you get that either? Jesus!\"So, aside from the rather amusing bleatings about how \"my country died tonight/the traitor moochers have taken over\", which provides me with no end of amusement, now the the Republican's and their handler's narrative is to figure out how to get the Women/Black/Latino/etc. block to vote for them.Here's a clue, assholes. Two clues.1) Try not to be so fucking smarmy and sarcastic when you talk about these people you are trying to court.     - and -2) If all you can think about is how to revive your party so you can get back into power, then, shit, maybe your version of the country should die!And good riddance! Me, I'd like to move into the 22nd century now, if you don't mind, because tha'ts where all the real problems are, not the most powerful empire in history worrying about whether God wants babies to be murdered in the womb, or how men managed to ride those dinosaurs. Okay?Speaking of the 22nd century, Charles C. Mann has an essay wondering if we as a species will get there. For those of you who don't know Charles C. Mann, he wrote the books \"1491\", and \"1493\".The essay is in Orion magazine, entitled \"State of the Species\".Basically, what with climate change, the current mass extinction, the population trend towards 10 billion by 2050, and resource depletion, there's every indication that humanity, as a successful invasive species, will wipe itself out. There are portions of the essay I disagree with, mainly the optimistic ones. He points out that humans, being behaviorally plastic, can change their collective behavior. We've done it in the past. So maybe we can do it in the future to save ourselves. The ghost of Lynn Margulis laughs at this. Probably.Mann points to the end of slavery, the feminist movement (more broadly universal suffrage), and Pinker's shaky theory on the decrease of violence.I'm not going to argue against the fact that these behavioral changes occurred. I do feel that Mann is too ready to accept simplistic versions of the circumstances (and in the case of Pinker, bad scholarship). I would have hoped for a more cynically optimistic examination of the origin, causes, and circumstances enveloping these changes. In the case of slavery, the industrial age, and the rise of power sources beyond wind, wave, and muscle, simply made slavery economically unfeasible. Not to mention slaves behaving badly. There can be no doubt there was a noble effort behind abolition, but the fact remains that the slavery remained in effect long after it was declared gone. In the case of African-Americans, you must move at least a century beyond the supposed end. And for little brown illegals from south of the border? Why, serfdom continues to this day in America.Or consider the suppression of women. Improved standard of living, control over reproduction, improved technological labor-saving advances, diminished the traditional role of woman as breeder and domestic slave. I certainly do not discount the awesome efforts of women to change their condition, but I also feel that circumstances had a lot to do with this trend.Pinker's theory? Ah, fuck it. I don't see it. Perhaps individual instances of violence have decreased, but you can't convince me that the bloodiest past five centuries in the history of civilization are somehow better than ancient Egypt, or the wholse-sale slaughter found in the Old Testament. But let's say it's true, that we individually are behaving better. Again, isn't this circumstantial, in that, being packed more closely together than ever before we display a tolerance not found in chimps?Okay, I'm picking nits now, probably, and in any case my continued criticisms are keeping me from one thing that struck me the fullest. E.O.Wilson's story of the fire ant. Here's the relevant quote:\"In the 1930s, Solenopsis invicta was transported to the United States, probably in ship ballast, which often consists of haphazardly loaded soil and gravel. As a teenaged bug enthusiast, Edward O. Wilson, the famed biologist, spotted the first colonies in the port of Mobile, Alabama. He saw some very happy fire ants. From the ant’s point of view, it had been dumped into an empty, recently flooded expanse. S. invicta took off, never looking back.The initial incursion watched by Wilson was likely just a few thousand individuals—a number small enough to suggest that random, bottleneck-style genetic change played a role in the species’ subsequent history in this country. In their Argentine birthplace, fire-ant colonies constantly fight each other, reducing their numbers and creating space for other types of ant. In the United States, by contrast, the species forms cooperative supercolonies, linked clusters of nests that can spread for hundreds of miles. Systematically exploiting the landscape, these supercolonies monopolize every useful resource, wiping out other ant species along the way—models of zeal and rapacity. Transformed by chance and opportunity, new-model S. invictus needed just a few decades to conquer most of the southern United States.Homo sapiens did something similar in the wake of Toba. For hundreds of thousands of years, our species had been restricted to East Africa (and, possibly, a similar area in the south). Now, abruptly, new-model Homo sapiens were racing across the continents like so many imported fire ants. The difference between humans and fire ants is that fire ants specialize in disturbed habitats. Humans, too, specialize in disturbed habitats—but we do the disturbing.\"    Now, what struck me was not the comparison of H. Sapiens to S. Invictus, but rather how our current model of capitalism looks a lot like the fire ant.Perhaps the original open source formation of capitalism, Capitalism v 1.0, found back in the Netherlands and jolly olde England, through its own tendency to disrupt itself with self-inflicted crises and disturb both its own formation and its environs through creative destruction, has become increasingly successful and virulent. An invading species all on its own, doubling down on its own bad behavior, until now - State Sanctioned Crony Capitalism v 8.9 - we have something that truly can destroy the planet on the next business cycle.Something to think about. My suspicion is, aside from some revisions in behavioral ethics, a return to neighborliness and stewardship, and a mature, adult responsibility towards not just the shareholders, but the community at large, we may need to seriously rethink the concept of ownership.And I honestly can't see any useful ideas coming from the Right. Not with them only able to see out to the end of their short dicks."},

{"title": "Zusammenbindenkugel", "date": "Monday, November 5, 2012", "text": "My German is a bit rusty, not having used it in some forty years. Did I say a bit rusty? My German is more like a corroded stony inclusion within a yeasty banded iron formation about to be subducted into the Earth's mantle, to be recycled in a magma stew for the next hundred million years. Perhaps by then, I might have a better pronunciation. Last time I tried with a native speaker, he said I sounded like I was from Australia, and don't ask me how.In any case, I'm looking for a word. I'll get to the concept in a second, but I figure, this word that I am looking for might best be found in the German. The word has many of the contextual similarities to the word gestalt, but not quite.Gestalt, by the way, means \"form\" or \"shape\", and is used to refer to the concept of 'wholeness'. I rather like this definition: \"a structure, configuration, or pattern of physical or psychological phenomena so integrated with properties not derivable by summation of it parts\". In different words, the \"whole is greater than the sum of its parts\".A diamond has a hardness, clarity, and color that cannot be found in a collection of carbon atoms, ither individually or in a group. A certain configuration reveals the diamond. In quantum mechanics, it is found that it takes a collection of around 150 atoms to exhibit qualities of a bulk object. And so on.The concept I'm thinking of has the idea of group wholeness within, but applied back down from the group to the individual components. A little while ago, I was reading about the history of gunpowder. Now, for the longest time, warfare was a very personal affair. You had to get right up in an opponent's face and engage in hand-to-hand combat. Why, even with advent of gunpowder and firearms, it was until recently, say, some 150 years, that combat was still a very personal affair.When Colonel William Prescott issued the order \"Don't fire until you see the white of their eyes\"prior to the Battle of Bunker Hill, it was not an encouragement to exhibit steadfast bravado, but rather a practical instruction. Meaning, the muskets back then were notoriously inaccurate, and one truly needed to be that close to have any effect.  There are accounts of soldiers serving in ranked files pressed shoulder to shoulder. This sounds like a recipe for disaster, as such a close grouping assures a higher probability that someone should be killed or wounded by even a wildly stray projectile. And yet, there is testimony that this close physical contact, this comforting assurance of the presence and contact of your neighbor to either side, bolstered the courage of an individual. It provided fortitude to soldiers who would rightly cower and turn to retreat when facing an opponent all alone, or in a disconnected and motley group. I wonder if much the same happens with cells of the body? This portion of the concept, in unity is strength, in a binding and twining of fibers, a stronger rope is formed, is part of what I'm looking for. Applied to social individuals, we would call it community.But the other part of the concept, the idea that the whole provides strength to the components, that the whole transfers its emergent properties back down to the parts, I don't think a term exists for it. It is why I chose the term zusammenbindend, the binding together, the interconnecting, the bundling, the braiding, and kugel, which is an orb, or a world, producing a high tenacity, self-containned, self-reinforcing, powerful ball-lighting of a thing, or a process, or an ecology - something like the kernmantle of cordage terminology, but with extra spicy infinite loop of magical goodness.I wonder if it would be perpetual motion?

{"title": "Mechanicules", "date": "Thursday, November 1, 2012", "text": "I'd like to take credit for the term \"mechanicules\", but earliest known credit, I suppose, goes to Michael Kandel, the English translator of Stanislaw Lem's The Cyberiad.I now have nine mechanicules (originally called 'mechanical bacteria\", but the problem is a mechanicule can range from milli- to micrometer size, and, although bacteria also inhabit that size range, they are typically quite small, on average about two microns) ready for casting. The waxes have been rigged, and, as you can see here, already been dipped once in ceramic slurry for the first surface coat.Rigging is kind of a science. A surprisingly Neolithic science. You have to be aware of how not only how the molten metal will flow in, and how the metal will cool down, but also how the wax will melt out, and how the sprue and runners and vents should be positioned to effectively introduce metal and remove air, and also what surfaces can't be adequately cold worked later on, and which arrangement of what will lead to the minimum amount of defects (and note I said minimum, not absence). I'm sure, in the Star Trek future, you'll just dial up the form you want and it will pop out of the replicator, but until then, it's all proven 7,000-year-old technology.You might remember this one, prior to rigging it looked like this.It had to be cut up because there woul dhave been problems with the non-uniform thickness of the piece. The long thin tendrils attached to the kind of anal-bead spheres would have created a casting defect known as a shrinkage defect. (And, one of my fellow instructors, Charlie, made the anal bead/buttplug analogy. My response to that, given the size of the piece, was \"You're a braver man than I am, Charlie\").Here's the last one in the series, a rather Geiger-esque penile chestburster type of critter:It's funny how rigging up a sculptural piece can produce a whole new sculptural piece. Here is what it will look like after casting and reassembly:I actually kind of imagine this critter to be able to grasp and hold a human hair (approx 100 micrometers in thickness) in one of its little claws, which means that, \"life-size\" this particular mechanicule would be about 2 millimeters stem to stern. I've seen really teeny tiny ants about that large.What would it do? I don't know, maybe a couple trillion of them crawling over your scalp, with a little SQUID magnetometer and voltmeters packed inside of, might be able to read your brain. Or keep your hair cut. Or both. Or something. My personal mythology about all this is that the mechanicules are all part of the techniome, or microtechiome, or microtechnobiome (if you go with the idea that they are classified as a biological phenotype, which I guess they are). But I prefer microtechniome, in that it keeps the confusion to a minimum, and the maximum amount of fairly clueless and non-tech-savvy people I've sampled seem to get it.And the idea can be found in the Empire of Texas arc of  the Convergence tales, in a visitation from the incredibly dangerous mechanical being, Edward Hopper, to my adopted home planet of Alterra, when he brought his very large array of little support servo environment of tiny little robots that infests his super advanced technological body. (Which, BTW, if you haven't figured it out, was neutralized by a Teuthid Plague that infested every human and made them immune to Texan Technological Zombification. And if all of the prior isn't a sign that I'm in the middle stages of schizophrenia, I really don't know what I else I can do for you).In any case, because Kohler refused my proposal to pursue further investigations into the Texan techniome, I believe I'll give up the usual bullshit art submission con games, and write up some kind of  proposal to Kickstarter to make more of this shit in glass, bronze, and aluminum.I be working on that presently."},

Pray with me.\"O Lord, we know that life begins at conception, and in that magical and miraculous moment when sperm cordially greets egg, it is by your Divine Will that it come to pass. And so, if it be Your Will, that with the horrible act of rape a Life should begin, and a soul be injected into bodily vestment, then Lord we pray that the child be a healthy child. And let it be a man child. So that one day, this child may take avenge its mother, and take a recckoning upon the rapist, his father, so that the cycle of violence can continue, as is Your Will,  forever and ever. Amen\". I'm reminded of two stories in Harlan Ellison SF compilation Dangerous Visions. A story by Robert Bloch (of Psycho fame), called A Toy for Juliette, tells of a far future society of dystopian libertarianism, in which the inhabitants are free to do any and every act that they can imaged. The serial killer Jack the Ripper is plucked out of the past, and is allowed to 'play' with the future denizens.Harlan Ellison continues the narrative in the next story of the collection, titled  The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World. We find out that, compared to the far future denizens, Jack the Ripper is not only a rank amateur, but a fairly innocuously bland amateur at that, compared to the abject moral nihilism of these future beings.The question is, is our society becoming more and more psychopathic? An article in the Chronicle for Higher Education, titled \"The Psychopathic Makeover\" suggests that it is so:\"In fact, in a survey that has so far tested 14,000 volunteers, Sara Konrath and her team at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research has found that college students' self-reported empathy levels (as measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, a standardized questionnaire containing such items as \"I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me\" and \"I try to look at everybody's side of a disagreement before I make a decision\") have been in steady decline over the past three decades—since the inauguration of the scale, in fact, back in 1979. A particularly pronounced slump has been observed over the past 10 years. \"College kids today are about 40 percent lower in empathy than their counterparts of 20 or 30 years ago,\" Konrath reports\".Many would excuse both Akins' and Mourdock's comments on rape as contextually misunderstood, but I, and a lot of other Americans still possessed of some semblance of moral wrinkle our noses in disgust at this comtemptible rationalizations. \"Oh, but he meant well.\" \"No really, he has a good heart\". \"He really does have the best intentions, even if he didn't present it in the most elegant possible way\".Yeah, so did Hitler. No small part of psychopathy is a sanctimonious vision, a steadfast belief that, so long as the actions are benign, the ends justify the means. Not all psychopathic acts can be traced to this source, but, for my liking, lately, a bit far too many.Oh, yeah, and another mechanical bacterium:"},
{"title": "Democracy Constrained", "date": "Wednesday, October 24, 2012", "text": "This fog... this, this haze I've been in since 1957, it occasionally lifts, and I get a brief glimpse of, I don't know, maybe a small piece of coherence.Like, say, when the Soviet Union collapsed back in 1991, and all the bonehead rednecks were pumping their fists and celebrating, when all the Cold War triumphalism was going on, when the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and the U.S. government was promoting the \"Washington Consensus\", the neo-liberal policies of Reagan, Thatcher, and the Austrian School, I thought to myself \"This is not going to be good\".Was I wrong to think that back then? Was it just too much dope and beer?I mean, let me get this straight. Because the U.S. outlasted the socialist agenda, we were told that the path to successful development, the best path, was a specific brand of capitalism  in which the state would play a minimal role in regulating the economy. Governments should reduce regulations upon private enterprise, end subsidies for favored industries, reduce trade barriers, allow for foreign investment and increase imports, privatize state enterprises, maintain fiscal discipline (meaning, keep inflation in check, even if his required austerity measures), and yet also provide for strong legal protections for property rights.This, we were told, was what allowed Western capitalism to prevail over the Communists. This, we were told, was all self-evident. One had only to look at the outcomes of the two competing systems. Just don't look too closely. Embedded in the message was the implicit assumption that Western capitalism was, through actions taken within the post-war world, solely responsible for the collapse of the Soviet Union. That the measures taken - engaging the Soviet Union in a prolonged arms race, bleeding it in Afghanistan, providing the coup de grace through the Star Wars boondoggle - somehow brought down a political system that had endured, nay, even thrived, under far more dire circumstances and conditions prior to and during WWII (self-induced famines, pogroms, endemic terrors, massive incompetence, and a tidal wave of criminal insanity from the direction of the Third Reich).Couple this questionable assumption with broad changes in the global postwar economy, the collapse of the European colonial systems, the internal contradiction and transformations within the Soviet Union itself, and it starts to look like the fall of the Berlin Wall, the series of \"soft\" revolutions in Eastern Europe, and the slow dissipation of the Soviet Empire really had very little to to do with actions on the part of the United States.Indeed, many of the actors of that period are still alive, especially in Russia and Eastern Europe, and their general reaction, when provided the hollow declaration that the \"Reagan and the U.S. won the Cold War\" are laughing jags which ends in alarming purple-faced coughing fits. Why, even the Americans recognized the event as tremendously anticlimactic. Propagandists did what they could, but it was mainly hollow, mainly untenable, and mainly preaching to the choir. And was the form of capitalism espoused in the Washington Consensus the one that was actually used? After all you had massive government subsidies - both aboveboard and under the table - to the Defense Boondoggle Industrial Complex. Massive? That's a rather inadequate descriptor. Prodigious, stupendous, tremendous? Not even close. Considering the trillion of dollars spent, and that trillions in miles gets you to the nearest star system, astronomical might work - if you include obscene behind it.Property rights? Maybe at the corporate level, sometimes at the private level, was stridently enforced. But at the public level? Time and again, huge abuses were allowed and never punished. Time and again, shit was dumped into our water and air, into our bodies, into the minds and bodies of our children, and not a damn thing was done about it. And government was one of the worst offenders!You get the idea. Our subsidized system of graft and corruption - perhaps the only real form of capitalism that can exist - was the one that was in place when the Soviet Union took a shit in the shower and slipped on it.And when those neo-liberal policies were actually attempted (and note the places where they were not - India and China), the results were disastrous. Consider the 30 year history of loans to Latin America, conditional on privatization, deregulation, and other structural adjustments, has been abysmal. Percent GDP has been around 1% per annum, in contrast to 2.6% from 1960-1981. Argentina has suffered tremendously from this policy.In fact, in every region of the world where the consensus has been enforced, economic growth has been  pitiful, and debt has grown at alarming rates. When it was attempted just a little bit here in the U. S. we ended up with the Lost Decade.No, the system that we had in place - that was in place, and didn't much do more than stay in place during the dissolution of the Soviet Union - looked nothing at all like the one proposed, and neither seemed to have worked all that well anyway, if you follow current events.What's clear is that the neo-liberal version of capitalism is like communism - it looks good on paper. But practicing it in the real world - either here in the U.S. or abroad, results in a monumentally titanic nested Russian doll cluster fuck of a cluster fuck. Why is it so fucking hard for people to understand that?Oh, yeah, and more mechanical bacteria:"},
{"title": "\"We're 21-2-3!\"", "date": "Thursday, October 18, 2012", "text": "\"We're 10 and 1!\" That was Bill Murray's statistic for America's war record in the movie \"Stripes\".\"Kicking ass for 200 years!\". Should that be our bumper sticker? We wish.Now we've fought, what? How many actual wars? Are we gonna count the ethnic cleansing wars against the aboriginals (that would include our brief colonial aspirations)? I guess we should.And does the Cold War count as a war? The War Against Terror? I don't think so. All those pansy UN \"interventions\", like Bosnia and Somalia, or ginned up photo-ops like Grenada? No. Nope.So when we total up all the wars the USA has been in up to 2012, I get 26 wars. And in terms of wins, since we have to (yes, have to) include French assistance, you can't really put the Revolutionary War in the \"win\" category, but then, throw in our bullying around the world, but mainly in Central America, and we'll pretend that rounds things up to a whole number. So we got 26 wars, of which we lost two (War of 1812, Vietnam), tied three (Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan). So, we're 21-2-3.Hey, did you notice something? It's the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812! Doesn't get much press does it? Well, we lost, and that's why. Why bring up embarassments that we'd all just as soon forget. Why bring up the time when Canada kicked our ass?Canada!We don't want to talk about it. I think we should, though. Or at least some aspects of that war. You want a synopsis? War in Europe against Napoleon. The Brits need able seamen, and are not above kidnapping American sailors to serve involuntarily on British warships (Impressment). Not much the American navy can do, considering the Brits are the naval superpower of the time. So President Madison, under pressure from chickenhawks in Congress, declares war against Great Britain. The Brits are all like, \"Seriously? We are fighting a real war here, you know\". And so, little pipsqueak America tells John Bull to put up his dukes, as he's slugging it out with the French, and John Bull kind of mushes America's face with a backhand, and we fall on our ass into the mud, arms and legs akimbo. And of course, to our embarrassment, the Impressment issue has been resolved prior to the declaration of war.Now, some will suggest that this was all to further American encroachment into the Northwest Territories (now the Midwest) west of the Appalachians, and the Southwest Territories (now Alabama and Mississippi), and to quench our lust for Ontario and Quebec. Oh, cynical creatures! To think to debase and besmirch our national character thusly!(And, well, duh, yeah, dude, for the Continental Empire of Liberty? Duh! Yeah!)Two things stand out. The 2nd Amendment. Read it? It's one of the few laws that includes a justification clause at the beginning:A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.Well, friends, if ever there was a war that puts the ridiculous delusional myth of the citizen soldier to rest, it's the War of 1812. Keep in mind, even today, you've got fucking idiots who, because they are carrying firearms, think that they can defend themselves from foreign invaders and criminal elements. They think that the mere possession of some kind of weapon upon their person or within their home makes them invulnerable - immune to not only the laws of God and Man, but to the physical parameters of the universe itself.All I can hope for these supposedly bad-assed motherfuckers is that they may some day find out that that particular job opening has been filled. And the result of their miscalculation? Rusty blenders, some painful gender benders with a wedgie suspender, a crumbled body bag labeled 'Return to Sender'. But I digress, the public mood of the time was distrust in a standing army as a temptation towards tyranny.  It was felt that the citizen's militia was more than adequate to defend the nation. And the goofy thing about the war of 1812, is that they had so much lead time to prepare. Most political leaders, chafing at the bit to move Westward, saw war with Britain as inevitable. President Thomas Jefferson, in 1807, suggested to Governor William Hull of the Michigan Territory that he begin planning an invasion of Canada! And yet our military forces were a joke. In the Jeffersonian imagination, the United States enjoyed the protection of a vigilant citizen's militia. But even in Jefferson's time, the militia was considered something of joke, with the annual states' muster more a circus carnival of drunken debauchery than an actual military training exercise.With the start of the war, it was soon realized that a terrible mistake had been made, with Britain's much smaller professional army regularly besting and routing American amateurs. Though there were a few victories at sea, on the whole America's land war was distinctly unfortunate - one disaster after the next. Adding to the pathetic arming and equipping of the militia was the incompetence of the commanding officers - almost every one either a political appointee or successful local business leader.  The inept officers struggling with their own bumbling inadequacies, found it even more difficult to deal with citizen soldiers, who expected respect for their rights as Americans. Mutinies were common, as were outright recalcitrance and mass cowardice under fire. Contemptuous British forces referred to most battles as \"nothing much more than scaring the militia\".  As a military historian G.W Cullum wrote in his Campaigns of 1812 - 1815:Our so-called army, except Barney's seamen and Peter's regulars, was a heterogeneous mass without order or discipline, and had scarcely one officer with the least knowledge of actual warfare\".In short, it was a long comedy of folly and error, and it is little wonder we choose to ignore. The only unfortunate incident was the Battle of New Orleans. Jackass Andy Jackson went up against quite possibly the most incompetent general in the British army. As a result of the victory of American forces, the lessons that could have been learned were undermined. This victory, through judicious fluffing up in the press and in Congress, allowed not only the Jeffersonians to save face, but also prevented expansion of the US Army. This would haunt us later in the Mexican War, when militia units proved to be more of a danger to themselves and the regular army  - and the lowest, scummiest, worst form of scoundrels in the treatment of Mexican citizens.So much for the glorious militia. And yet even today, we have boneheads that think it could work.\"Wolverines! Wolverines! Wolverines!\"The other shameful aspect of the War of 1812 (and the Revolutionary War before it) was the wholyy disgusting and disrespectful treatment of American veterans. The United States has long had a tradition of the most despicable set of behaviors towards our veterans, but one would be hard-pressed to find worst treatment. Just as in the Revolutionary War, veterans would fight a penurious and criminally dishonest Congress for promised pensions nearly forty years later. Public sentiment was much worse, labeling them \"mercenaries and parasites\".What a laudable, great-hearted, wise and generous people our forefathers were!"},

And please, spare me the whole ridiculous third party bullshit. Like term limits, that's not only a simplistic idea, but a futile one as well. You want change?

It may be that by voting for Obama, it is only a three hour delay towards the eventual right-wing dictatorship we will live under, but that is three hours longer than any other alternative.And at least Obama is behind science and technology, and for heading towards the 22nd century, instead of wanting to hide in the past. And Mitt seems determined to burn every last shred of combustible material in sight, just burn it all up until it's all gone, because then, why the Rapture will be here, and the country can be fueled by all those burning souls in Hell. Because, you can tell just by looking at him, that it is not enough that Mitt and his cronies rule in Heaven, he needs to be able to see the rest of us suffering in Hell.Schadenfreude is the Republican middle name."},

{"title": "'Looper': A Review", "date": "Monday, October 8, 2012", "text": "This actually isn't going to be a review. More a rationalizing wank to justify my suspension of disbelief for what was, in my opinion,  well crafted and entertaining horror movie.Now, I think we need to get this out of the way right now. Time travel stories fall squarely within the horror genre. Not science fiction, not fantasy, or rather, maybe those, but if so, then placed on the horror shelf.I mean, think about it. It's Time Travel! What could possibly go wrong?You may think you can think of counter examples that don't fit the mold. Take Groundhog Day. That's a comedy, right? Wrong! Horror movie.Bill Murray gets trapped in causal loop and almost immediately commits suicide to get out of the nightmare. Horror comedy movie. Or comical horror movie. There's no blood, no gore, no shocking surprises, no psychological tension, but it's still a horrible trap to be stuck in Time. Get the idea? It's an existential thing. Life is a beautiful horror movie. Time travel is just another metaphor for that fucking fly in the ointment, that pea under mattress, that ruins an otherwise beautiful experience. But, as the Buddha said, or should have said, even Hell can be comfortable with the right mindset.Exhibit B. The previews for 'Looper'? Chosen and shown using the patented diabolical you-also-might-be-interested-in marketing algorithm, every single preview was a horror movie.Speaking of that, I would request that you complain to the management (and I have) about  1) the fucking sound volume in the theater, has everyone gone deaf? and  2) the fucking near-subsonic bass sensurround buzz that shakes the muscles in my back and       just annoys the hell out of me.Oh, and, as a result of the Aurora Colorado shootings, and with what the sainted George Carlin called the continuing pussification of America, they now have a fucking safety lecture film before the movie. Seriously? \"Look for the exits!\" we are told, \"The exits may be to your left... or to your right... or behind you!\" At this point, the film malfunctioned or got cut short with \"... in case of an emergency-\"Fortunately for me, a wag in the audience displayed perfect comedy timing by shouting, a half beat after the cut off \"What!? WHAT DO WE DO?!!!\"I swear to the Almighty, I must come across as Uncle Fester in these movie houses, as I seemed to be the only one that laughed, and such is the case at other supposedly inappropriate moments. Of course, I'm laughing at a different level. For example, when Bruce Willis' character kills every single mob gatman in the syndicate headquarters, I laughed my ass off. I was the only one that was laughing, and people were changing seats to move away from me. I was amused because it was obviously a homage/ripoff of the police station massacre scene from the Terminator. Alright, so, 'Looper'. I thought it a well-crafted and consistently entertaining action movie, with only a minimum of stupidity, which, coming from me, is high praise.Director and writer Rian Johnson, I suspect, is not a Republican.  The dystopian future of 2044, set in, I'm guessing, Kansas City, is what happens if the Age of Reagan continues. Sustained economic collapse, elimination of all safety nets, continued unwise accelerated depletion of resources, laissez-faire capitalism, devil-take-the-hindmost, every-man-for-himself social philosophies, which engenders and encourages a criminal attitude towards life, in which case you have the increasingly fewer and fewer elite being protected by feral humans, who themselves have obviously displaced the soft and pampered Romney-style elites to become the new criminal elite. But somehow, against all fortune and logic, China, which is and shall ever be a basket case, is a paradise in 2074.Time travel in the future is outlawed. And as we all know, if time travel is illegal, only criminals will have time travel.  I took this to be a jab at the stupid conservative logic against gun control. I also was pleased with the extremely low bar set for this new technology. Rather than risk the present by changing the past, our conservative crime bosses of the future use time travel for garbage disposal. They sent unwanted elements into the past to be assassinated and disposed of. Interestingly, there must be some higher form of governing, as the crime bosses are worried about body indentification, which suggests they fear a higher authority. (And of course, I just can't see governments NOT using time travel, or perhaps the dirty business is farmed out to the syndicates, in which, oh, man, government in the future is truly fucking right-wing totalitarian scary).Speaking of scary, one of the best, possibly even classic, sequences in the movie involves the slow mutilation of a future-self looper as a mob tactic of persuasion. Seth, a looper, allows his future self to escape. In order to get the older self to surrender, Seth is surgically mutilated. As a result, his older self  is alarmed to find himself losing parts of his anatomy until he gives himself up. This wonderfully creepy sequence of scenes is utilized later when Bruce Willis finds scars appearing on his person - only to find out it is self-mutilation to set up a meeting with his younger self.As I said, time travel movies are horror movies, and this was one of the more creative and inventive horror mechanisms I've seen used.I'm able to ignore the limitations of narrative in depicting time travel - it's just a movie after all. Some people are puzzled by it, but I'd say it's their loss to think too much about it.I think my only (and very small) objection (although it is used well in the plot) is the need for the telekinetics. These people have a mutation that allows them to move small objects with their minds. The common example is that they can levitate a quarter. This is considered a useless talent. But, you know, the amount of energy needed to counteract the mass of a quarter against gravity is around 4,905 ergs, which is more than sufficient force to constrict a minor artery - say, for example, one that feeds blood to that motor region of the brain that controls breathing. Why the TK freaks are not used for assassination is not explored. It was used as a plot device to explain how a more powerful TK freak - a \"holy terror\" known as the Rainmaker - is able to take over the world's crime syndicates single-handedly, but the plot could have moved forward without this device. As I said, a minor quibble.The fact that this movie even makes me go through this speculative wank is proof positive that it will no doubt become a cult classic  - up there with The Terminator, and - naturally - 12 Monkeys.(And if you have never seen the movie 12 Monkeys was based upon - La jetée - stop everything now, and watch it)."},
{"title": "Causal Superposition", "date": "Thursday, October 4, 2012", "text": "I will eventually see the movie \"Looper\". Perhaps this Friday. I've already found out, through spoiler sites, how the movie goes down. I'll not spoil it here, even though it doesn't matter.But it brings up the whole \"time travel will fuck with your brain\" discussion of how things could go down. So, here's my example:I get in my time machine. I go back to the year 1933, to Berlin, to a Siemens factory where Hitler gives a speech to the workers. I choose this venue specifically because it has been documented. I appear on the platform next to Hitler, whip out a Franchi Spas-12 shotgun, and Buh-BAMM, blood and bone everywhere, Hitler's head pretty much a mangled cabbage. His body goes through the remarkably coordinated antics that can be seen in headless chickens, spasming and convulsing about, with perhaps an involuntary final Nazi salute as the right arm twitches and flails upward, the hand extended rigidly out almost as if to wave bye-bye. Despite my laughter at this unexpected comedy performance, I manage to pump maybe two more shots to the body for dramatic effect, and then Poof, back to the future.And when I get back to the future, nothing has changed. Nazi Germany forms. WWII takes place. Hitler dies in the bunker with Mrs. Hitler in 1945. Wait a minute, now. I offed him. I got his blood and bone fragments on my overcoat. I even had a little helmet cam to document it, and sure enough, I offed him. And yet I go to that youtube video, and there he is giving a speech without incident.What happened? Well, according to many-worlds interpretation, I went to the wrong past. That resolved the paradox.Of course, the paradox is the Grandfather paradox. You can't go back in time to kill your mean old abusive cuss of a grandfather, because if you had, you would never have been born (assuming he was your biological grandfather, with no cheap trick Hollywood resolutions). This is a logical paradox.But then again, it could be that there is something akin to Stephen Hawking's \"Chronology Protection Agency\", which is not a time cop force, but rather, some type of inelastic quality of the cosmos that prevents events in the past from having a different outcome.Fritz Lieber explored this idea in the story \"Try and Change the Past\", in which a time traveler attempts to foil his own death by fatal gunshot wound through an increasingly desperate series of interventions. In the end, he manages to remove any chance of death by bullet, only to have his past self killed by an outer space meteorite fragment right between the eyes. buh-BAM! (Can you tell I am channeling Santino Corleone from the Godfather today?)The Conservation of Reality, as Lieber called it, serves any time travel story well, and is clever enough, but there's no reason for it. It only satisfies our principle of parsimony, but there is absolutely no reason that reality has to be parsimonious. We would just like for it to be that way.And speaking of reason, that's the problem with the paradox. The impossibility of the paradox relies on the violation of a principle of Boolean algebra - a thing cannot be one thing and its opposite.Well, that's true enough for binary yes/no logic, but who said the Universe has to obey a human conceptual invention?Quantum mechanics does not have this problem. All sorts of things can be one or another thing at the same time down in the subatomic world. And now, there's a suspicion that causality itself may not be so cut and dried. Scientists at the University of Vienna and Libre de Bruxelles have used quantum mechanics to conceive of situations where an event can be both the cause and the effect of another one - in short, the past and future and be superposed and entangled.\"The idea that events obey a definite causal order is deeply rooted in our understanding of the world and at the basis of the very notion of time. But where does causal order come from, and is it a necessary property of nature?\" Further reading can be found at http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v3/n10/full/ncomms2076.html.Wait a minute? Didn't I write about this already. Shit, it's deja vu all over again!Oh, and speaking of deja vu, Sputnik would be celebrating its 55th year in space today, if it hadn't burned up on reentry: Missile #27.\"Such a superposition, however, has not been considered in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics since the theory always assumes a definite causal order between events\", says Ognyan Oreshkov from the Université Libre de Bruxelles (formerly University of Vienna). \"But if we believe that quantum mechanics governs all phenomena, it is natural to expect that the order of events could also be indefinite, similarly to the location of a particle or its velocity\", adds Fabio Costa from the University of Vienna.Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2012-10-quantum-causal.html\"Such a superposition, however, has not been considered in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics since the theory always assumes a definite causal order between events\", says Ognyan Oreshkov from the Université Libre de Bruxelles (formerly University of Vienna). \"But if we believe that quantum mechanics governs all phenomena, it is natural to expect that the order of events could also be indefinite, similarly to the location of a particle or its velocity\", adds Fabio Costa from the University of Vienna.Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2012-10-quantum-caus"},
{"title": "I Can't Draw", "date": "Monday, October 1, 2012", "text": "\"You don't draw\", my weekend boss said to me, as we worked on his latest project.The latest project is a purely geometric aluminum sculpture destined for Key West at the end of November. The fabrication of this sculpture is more about cabinet making and proper joint fitting and exactitude rather than a wild and effusive creative orgy. More teeth cleaning than gun slinging. As a result, he is having a terrible time of it. He draws out multiple plans of 2D projections for the strange compound angles that occur when joining two parallelograms and a trapezoid at sixty degree angles.\"I don't\" I replied. \"I probably should, but I see what we need to do in my head in 3D, and so I don't need to draw. I can rotate it around and look at it in my head, and I know what we need to do without drawing it\".\"I know\", he says, and it pisses him off.I really should draw more often though. Back in the late 80s, I gave up on skiing. No one particular reason, I just no longer did it. I used to water and snow ski. I think the last time I water skied (slalom) was 1987. And snow skiing (not quite black diamond advanced skiing - but I was always a natural at it), would have been 1992 I'm thinking. I have no doubt that I would be an embarrassment on the slopes now, and probably would not be able to get up out of the water on a slalom ski.And so it is with drawing. I took some drawing course at local community colleges up until about 1996. The work was passable, certainly not photo-realistic, but fairly accurately renderings, and with my own particular flair.Now, my drawing skills have degenerated to a sixth-grade level. Sixth? Perhaps third.Now, I know it's all practice and patience. I suppose I should start drawing again.I used to do quite a bit of cartooning. I pretty much stopped about the same I stopped skiing. I came across some cartoons in a notebook I found in my closet. If I can remember, I'll snap digital photos of them and show them to you.So, I decided to try to cartoon that Saturday night. The result was like something out of kindergarten, and there was no way I could display it. So, I took that cartoon and spent a good twenty minutes redrawing it. Wow, I am really out of shape."},
{"title": "Varmint", "date": "Thursday, September 27, 2012", "text": "When last we parted ways, gentle reader, I had returned from an interventionist mission to the Empire of Texas, and ended up with a twelve-foot-tall living machine for a house guest. The original colonists from Earth - mainly from Texas, Oklahoma, and surrounds - had been transported millions of light years and thirteen thousand years into the past. These people had, through the intervening millennia, transformed themselves into superhuman beings, gone all crazy and dangerous, and had fortunately been repressed  by their former operating system/machine servants. The godlike trans-human Texans are now trapped - like evil djinns - as collections of contorted photons running at near zero speeds in ultra cold and attenuated gases enclosed in vacuum flasks.Clear enough summary? Good.Our expendable intervention team came to an agreement with the Empire of Texas - live and let live. They wouldn't force their technologically-advanced civilization upon humanity, and humanity, in return, would not go extinct from exposure. One visitor was allowed from the Empire of Texas - my house guest, Edward Hopper. Well, Edward Hopper, the twelve-foot-tall robot, and unknown to us at the time, a myriad and variegated mechanical support bestiary orbiting about and upon his person like a bad case of crabs. Which Edward proceeded to give to pretty much the entire ecosystem of Alterra - even after he and I spending a month in the isolation dorm up on Sessus (the smaller moon of Alterra).  Oh, did I not mention that my adopted planet, the one out Hercules Way, was named Alterra? I thought I had.  Well, Alterra was first settled back in 1996, and primarily by folks from Pacific Northwest coast of the USA - mainly Seattle, Portland, Northern California, some from San Francisco. The colonists were pretty much people trying to get away from the chronically depressed economic conditions that exist there.The survey biologists characterized the planet as being about the same as Earth during the middle Miocene, perhaps the Serravallian stage (13.8  - 11.6 million years ago). They were gobsmacked, much as European explorers to the New World, by the sheer immensity of numbers of living creatures there. Not to mention lush plant life. The planet has extensive woodlands. Kelp forests and grasslands were recent additions to the pageant of life. In the sea, sharks as big as whales, and shark-toothed whales big enough to eat other whales. Big animals on Alterra are in general are twice as big as on Earth. On Alterra, there are pelicans with 15-20 foot wingspans, as well as flightless predatory terror birds, some 10 to 12 feet tall. There are saber-toothed lions and tigers, giant running bears, herd animals the size of dump trucks. Not surprising, as no intelligent killers evolved there.In short, Alterra is - for outdoorsy types - Paradise. And it worked out well for the colonists, what with plenty of pristine wilderness to despoil. Of course, due to the tree-hugging Left Coast influence, and a healthy influx of Finns, not as much despoilation as you might expect from Americans has occurred. The seas are filthy with life, and the extant megafauna pretty much left unmolested.Spiral City was founded on a northern pointing peninsula of a very nice navigable bay on the west coast of the largest continent. Surrounded by the analogs of giant redwood and sequoia, oak and pine, and to the east a large mountain range with snow-capped peaks, the place was similar enough to make more than one colonist's eyes well up with tears of homesickness.Seeing as the downtown of Spiral City was hastily built from native wood and rock, and then almost immediately declared a historical preservation site, it has a frontier quality about it. The strip malls downtown may be strip malls, but they are crafted from rough-hewn timbers, and collected boulders and rocks.  A conscious choice was made to built the rest of the city different, and so, aside from the spiral road plan, much of the outer city looks like it was given over to Antoni Gaudi's imagination. There's a playful quality to almost every building - regardless of its use.In short, when I visited back in 2001, I said to myself \"This is a really cool place, with really nice people, and I think I will stay\".The first time I met a kraken was at Sam's Pub in Spiral City, I thought it was a pile of fur coats splayed on a couch. Only when it opened it's eyes, and extended a partially fur-covered, leathery brown, hook-taloned tentacular limb, did I realize it was not. I also almost quite literally jumped out of my shoes.Scientists prefer that laypeople call them teuthids, but they are not squids. Nor are they cuttlefish,  or terrestrial octopi. Kraken are large, furry, alien monsters that have eight limbs. They spawned on a world hundreds of millions of light years from Earth, and at least a billion years before primates appeared.Kraken do possess a filamentous protein material that is primarily keratin, and so their fur can be rightly called fur. They do have eight limbs. There are times, however, when they move much more similarly to giant tarantulas, and other times when their \"tentacles\" move in a sinuous, snakelike manner. Taken together - given what some might call humans instinctive fear of snakes and spiders - time spent among the kraken can be quite exhausting, as one is constantly fighting semi-autonomic panic responses from the sight of them, or worse, a sight garnered from the corner of one's eye.When it comes to danger, evolution has graced us humans with two main pathways in the brain to detect it. One pathway takes the sensory (say, visual) data, and pumps it through the thalamic regions (the ancient lizard brain) to the amygdala - an almond-shaped region of the basal ganglia that processes primary emotions (and most importantly fear) and memory associations. Another pathway takes the sensory data, and sends it along a more leisurely route over the cerebral cortex to the frontal and pre-frontal lobes, where the sensory data is classified, parsed, massaged, categorized, and identified. Thus, if you see something that might be a snake, you unthinkingly react and jump away from it. This actually is a rather mild summary of a whole remarkable cascade of events that causes - among other things - the stomach to tighten, the heart to race, veins and arteries to constrict, blood pressure to rise, pituitary adrenal glands to pump out hormones, the feet andhands to turn clammy, the mouth to go dry, the brain to jump out of its skull, and the muscles to coordinate in an amazing superhuman feat of action.It is only after the frontal lobes, or perhaps the parietal, have determined that the movement you detected was not a snake, but a stick, or a rope, or something, that you feel like an idiot. Fortunately for me, whatever that titanium spike does that they drove into my skull, it seems to cancel or short-circuit the thalamic fear response. So, I'm quite comfortable around them, having only to deal with the aesthetic response to their unsightly appearance. They have little in the way of a sense of personal space, and so being in a mass of them - often not unlike entering a giant nest of snakes, their long, furry, spiderlike/tentacular limbs pressing up against my body, occasionally pricking me with their kitten-sharp talons - is something I've, well, not exactly grown used to, but have learned to tolerate. Others of my kind get the yammering willies just being around them, so the bar, Sam's Pub, that they frequent here on Alterra is usually not at all crowded.A few nights ago, Ed Hopper came back into town. He had been sojourning across the Eastern Steppes, which extend just beyond of the Dawn Mountain range all the way to the other end of the continent.  I'd asked him on his last journey, southward to the Great Southern Gulf, what he was doing, and he had replied \"Just surveying what an unaltered world looks like\".I'd invited Ed to Sam's Pub to watch me drink, it being a slow afternoon for me, and the early evening nearly upon us. The bar was half empty, a few regulars, and in the corner table, two kraken.I'd just gotten over a mild case of the flu, or rather, me and half of Spiral City. The other half was just coming down with it. There have been a few cases of pandemic respiratory distress throughout the population ever since this world was settled. I was feeling better, and what better way to complete the recovery than a shot and a beer. I'd just returned to the table when a commotion broke out at the far end of the bar, at the kraken table, a hissing and fizzing and breaking of glass.I'd seen this happen once before, a kraken fight, and you don't want to be anywhere near it. It is a magnificent sight. It's like being in a giant spider fight straight out of a horror movie. There is really no other way to properly describe it. Both kraken rear up on their hind tentacles, talons out along the full lengths of all their limbs, black fangs dripping foam, vagina dentata mouths spewing stringy snot. They go into a kind of a standing kung fu pose for what seems forever, and then they are just a knot of fur and flesh and claws and teeth that rolls around the bar from wall to wall, chairs and tables cracking and splintering under them. The bar patrons who are smart bolt for the exits during the initial stance. The rest cower in corners or against walls. I sat stock still, full shot glass and beer bottle in either hand. Ed Hopper, taking a cue from me, did the same. The kraken pair rolled around the bar, threatening to wreck the entire place. At one point, they actually rolled over our table and I saw a row of talons impale the wall inches from my face, as they caromed back into the center of the room. The violence ended as quickly as it had started. The kraken separated, paused as if nothing had occurred, and left the building. (I was told that a kraken later delivered the bartender an ingot of pure niobium).With the fight over with, and practically every stick of furniture in the place broken to pieces, I downed the shot and gulped the beer with a pair of shaking hands.\"Does that happen a lot?\" Ed Hopper asked.\"Yup\" I replied, and then noticed that there was a long gash on Ed's metallic thigh.\"Dude!\" I pointed, directing his attention to the torn up mesh and plate, \"I thought you were made of super metal or whatever\".Ed Hopper inspected the wound, and probably in much greater detail and analysis than my human senses, for he paused for a long time deep in thought and obviously startled.  I swear, had he been human, he'd have blanched. \"It is, as you put it, super metal, and self-healing as well!\" he replied in astonishment. The long gash didn't appear to be healing.Once I'd finished my beer, we departed the bar. The sun was close to setting. Edward Hopper looked pensive, or at least his posture I interpreted as pensive. He kept looking down at his torn-up thigh, as if he expected the gash to disappear, but it wasn't. Finally he bid me good-bye, and headed east out of town. About a week went by before I saw Ed again. In the meantime, the flu pandemic had subsided, and word had come down over the Alterranet that every human on every human planet had become ill, but had recovered. Curious, as some worlds had received no visitors, and, generally, strict protocols are in place to prevent the spread of interstellar disease (witness my extended isolation on the moon). In any case, Edward Hopper returned to town, and I spotted him as I was leaving Manny's, a literally world-class Mexican restaurant on the outskirts of Spiral City. Ed greeted me, and I invited him for a walk, as is my wont to do after a large dinner. We walked in silence for a good half-hour, and I finally took a seat on a boulder to burp and fart happily. We were just in time to see the Big C appear in the western sky, through the clouds, just above the setting sun.There are a few oddities about Alterra. Take, for just one example, the Big C, the Copyright Nebula. First time visitors are struck stupid by the sight of it in the night sky. It's a nearby planetary nebula, the remains of a supernova explosion, that looks like the copyright symbol. You know, a \"c\" inside a circle. Why, even during the daytime, especially when it appears from behind clouds, it is often confused with the larger moon Algemina. It's that big and bright. Here's the weird thing about it. It's only ten light years away. The supernova occurred some five thousand years ago. At ten light years away, the gamma ray flux should have completely eliminated my adopted planet's ozone layer, turning the upper layers of the atmosphere into a ugly brown smog, exposed all life to prolonged UV radiation, and at the very least caused some kind of a mass extinction. Alterra should be a dead world. Instead, it's a lovely peaceful, whole and healthy one. What's the explanation? We have none.Ed Hopper turned to me and said \"The kraken are protecting you. And I am but a toy compared to them. I am a primitive and inept bumbler next to them. Not even a savage. Just a dumb animal\".\"What are you talking about, Ed?\"Ed jutted his head up a the Big C. \"You see that? They did that!\"\"The supernova?\"\"No, you idiot, the shield, or field, or whatever it was, that kept the supernova from destroying this world. The Teuthids did that.\"\"Well, wait. That happened thousands of years ago. The kraken didn't even know we were going to settle here\".\"No\" said Ed, \"they did. They saved this world for you. He stared up at the Big C.\"You know that flu bug that swept through the populace?\" Ed continued, \"That wasn't just a flu bug. That was an engineered teuthid plague to counter the invasion of our little mechanized beasties\".\"What? What are you talking about?\"\"Honestly, Kurman, how your species ever managed to evolve into beings like me is a mystery sometimes. Look, we infested you humans with our microtechniome, our little mechanical zoo, as a just-in-case measure. You may fear us. But, we fear what you could become. You know, evil godlike superbeings. So the plan was to infest all of you with a control mechanism, all sorts of little critters that could be triggered to keep you in line. Livestock maintenance\".\"What?! What a shitty thing to do!\"\"Yeah, well, it doesn't matter. The teuthids engineered a suitable countermeasure. Or rather, they had the planet evolve one. All the human worlds evolved one. It's pretty much neutralized our techniome. And, even though they've left them all operational, save with a few exceptions. And I just got a little reminder\", as he glanced down at his torn-up thigh, \"just where I stand around here. I'm a feral cat, a varmint, allowed to live near the house. But that's about it\".He looked at me with, for lack of a better word, fear, and I have to admit, I liked it."},

Fair enough. Considering his agenda was to put the Republican party in control of the nation in perpetuity, I guess we have to analyze him as that guy that fell over, took a shit, hit the Lifealert button, and is writhing in pain - at 60,000 feet.I however, being little more forward looking (hopefully) would prefer a view from the ISS. (And actually, given the current condition of the world, and that NASA is investigating the possibility of a warp drive, would kind of more prefer the view from Alpha Centauri).Mitt Romney's True Inner SoulActually, I'm guessing Mitt Romney would prefer the view from Alpha Centauri, or already does - seeing as he increasingly seems to be from Outer Space, kind of like Mormon Jesus. Some people thought, well, Romney's got a good heart right? Now, we know, this was no gaffe, this was his true allegiance to the upper half against the bottom. Romney has, in case you weren't paying attention, finally come out of the Montgomery J. Burns closet, gleefully rubbing his greedy little hands together.Poor old Mitt Romney. On matters of immigration policy, could someone tell him how to say, in Spanish, \"Put a fork in me. I'm done\"? Someone really should shake this narcissist awake from his solipsist's nightmare and let him to go home to his elevator car castle. And while we are it, someone either tell Paul Ryan to put the PeeWee Herman red bow-tie and white shoes on, or give up on the bad impersonations already. Because It's Just Not Fucking Working Out For You.Of course, after the circus clown car fiasco of the Republican primaries, pretty much any strategist who had his shit together must have realized there was no fucking way the country could vote for this mess of a ticket. And so, quite naturally, the challenge shifted towards Republican capture of the Senate.Despite the candidate's best efforts, there's a good chance the Republicans will gain a majority in the Senate (which because of the current rules doesn't really mean shit), and retain the majority in the House. Many analysts have assumed that, with a good spanking in the presidential race, Republican politicians might return to some form of sanity. This is unrealistic.When, like the Whigs of 1856, you've painted yourself into a demographic corner, you do exactly the Republicans have done after every defeat, which is dig in your heels, and double down again on batshit crazy. Which, since doubling down is a geometric progression, means the Republicans are now at least 32 times as batshit insane as they were in 1980. And if you will recall, they were already living in the 1890s under Reagan.So, the word for the next four years is \"same shit, different day\", continued political kabuki theater, perhaps with any luck a Vietnamese underwater puppet show this time out.Hurry up with that warp drive, you guys!"},
{"title": "My Mechanical Zoo", "date": "Monday, September 17, 2012", "text": "The Atlantic had a fluff piece about the future of mobiles (I make a conscious effort to call them 'mobiles' now, as opposed to mobile phones). I call it a fluff piece because: 1) any news article that is not about a scientific discovery is not really news, as in new information, and therefore, fluff; and 2) the fact that the majority of the article is speculation based upon current trends and events which, let's face it, will be viewed as quaint and uninformed 'zeppelin in every garage' kind of talk in ten year's time. Did I say ten? Four.I'll try to avoid all of the gee-whiz-ain't-the-future-gonna-be-cool blather myself, and concentrate on the basic issues.Back in the 1970s, when Bruce Sterling first started writing a series of science fiction stories about his Shaper/Mechanist universe, he foresaw a time when humans would enhance themselves either biologically or through cybernetics. He envisioned the Shapers, the modifiers via biological means, to be enhanced solely through genetic modifications. He can be forgiven that his observation that the Shapers had eliminated intestinal bacteria from their bodies, and looked down upon other who had not done so as 'primitives'. His limited vision involving modifications only to the human genome was a sign of the times. Now, we know better, or actually, are starting to know better, about the true and vital interconnectedness of life forms (via our own personal bacterial/viral/fungal residents - our microbiome, and also the shared health through the network-of-networks community of our ecosystem, up  to and including the whole Earth). Were Bruce to re-imagine these stories today, the plots may not have changed much, but the space habitats and inhabitants would be vastly more rich and varied. Likewise, his Mechanists were limited to machine enhancements and prosthetics, couched upon the human form. Though there has not been much 'new' (Moore's Rule of Thumb not withstanding) engineering in this field, one would think that Bruce would perhaps give the Mechanists something similar - a mechanical analog to the microbiome, a techniome. And that's where I figure mobiles are going. I really can't see a plastic box you hold in your hand ten years from now. Currently, at least as the vision of the future is shaped by Apple, the mobile is a toy, a Vegas distraction, a prelude to a Brave New World of easy control through consumption. Something to occupy your thumbs. Something to get your brain lazy. The Apple vision of the mobile is a toaster. Which is to say, do you really need toast? You can get by with bread. If you want toast, do you need a toaster? No, you can use an oven, or a toaster oven, or a stove, or a fire for that matter.  And that is where it stands at the moment. Commenting on his own site to comments I made upon this subject, Craig Nulan put it this way:\"There is a significant joke embedded in the name \"I\" phone,pad, pod, etc....,The Android, OTOH, is an integrated utilitarian portal into the googlesphere. Having stood up a few hundred of each device in a mobile device management framework, the Android is virtually seamless instrument of borg orchestration and synthesis. The I-toy, on the other hand, is an infinitely personalizable hot-mess, never intended for any kind of coordinated collective use.There is remarkable irony in the Apple vs Samsung, soon to be Apple vs. Google intellectual property lawsuits when you reflect on the profound differences separating the intended application and use of I-toys vs. the intended application and use of Androids.\"And I think he's right. Google has very long-term plans that look beyond market share and stock price. That's my take. They are looking at things like mobiles, and banks and banks of server farms, Big Data living in the Cloud, the Internet-of-Things, drones, robots, droids, fablabs, 3D printers, printable electronics, open source living, not strictly in anticipation of the Singularity, but rather, defining the limits and protocols for the larger technological ecology for which we already have a very good model - Nature herself. And why not? This is all a product of biology, so it's just a continuation. But there are things coming soon not found in Nature, and I mean that in a good way.I do see a future where, beyond just my personal techniome of repurposed jewelry and clothes, all packed to the gills with chips and sensors, and possibly a hat (or will it be Hat capitalized?) which I presume will contain my brain/machine interface connection, or even my mechanical zoo, ala Dr. Suess, in which I use any particular animal I need from the Internet of Things to do stuff, will be something larger than the sum of its parts.What do I mean by that? Well, I sure don't need to own all sorts of things, but I see distinct advantages to partnering up with a mechanical bestiary (virtual animals that have a real-life mechanical opposite number). I don't need to own a bulldozer all the time, in fact, I barely use my electric drill, so why not borrow from the zoo? In fact, I start to question ownership of a lot of things that I use. (Clearly, there are some things I would keep to private use, but many I do not). So, why not share a zoo with other folks?I don't see this heading towards the Star Trek Borg future. I do see it heading towards fairy tales, and magical creatures, and a return to the open fields system. Maybe that's not the way it will go. But I have a suspicion, if we wish to continue as a viable social species, we will have to learn how to share and play nice - a lot better than we are currently doing."},
{"title": "Latest Cast Glass", "date": "Thursday, September 13, 2012", "text": "This wall piece isn't particularly striking or spectacular, but it isn't really meant to be that. Subtle. That's what I was going for. So, the deal behind this one is kind of a convoluted story. When I turned fifty-five, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois informed me I was now in a whole new health risk bracket, and bumped up my health insurance with a 14% increase.Seeing as I pay for my own health insurance, and really can't afford the two regular jobs I have, and my third job making sculpture is earning me negative numbers, I was in for a bit of a cash crunch for September. So, hat in hand, I got a temporary loan from my Mom to cover the difference. I'm not proud of admitting this, but on the other hand, since the circumstances are of my own choice, I 'm not going to be dishonest about it.Besides, all my other siblings have borrowed or taken monies from Mom at one point or another. And I'm rather proud of the fact that I've probably taken the least - despite my self-inflicted straightened circumstances.Look, I could have continued with my boring real job and lived a very comfortable life. I knew that the chances of me making a living at making art - or pursuing any artisanal craft lifestyle - were slim to none. I knew the gamble. I took the chance. So far, I'm losing. I got no problem with that.In any case, you don't really care about that. The point being I paid back the loan, and am throwing in a nice handmade gift as a thank-you. Here's the piece:\"Cloudscape\", approximately 11\" x 9\" x 2\", cast glass and walnut frameThe glass is about 3/4\" thick, and the textured 3/16\" thick bas-relief surface is against the wall, with a piece of 320 grit wet sanding paper as a backing. At first you think it's slate, but as you get closer, you see the bubbles and realize it is cast glass. So, like I said, subtle, which is where you want to go with Mom's decor. My understanding is it will hang in the office above the computer.I'm very comfortable casting glass. I've gotten to the point where I feel I have a very good handle on pretty much every technical aspect of casting. I've done a lot of empirical research to get there, and have no problems sharing it. More than half the battle, as it turns out, was the firing schedule for the kiln. That took me a good two months of tweaking one variable at a time. But basically, the answer to a good firing schedule is - go slow on the ramp up. What's your hurry? You probably put a minimum of several hours into the preparation of the piece, so what's the rush firing it?In any case, like I said, I've gotten very comfortable casting glass and I really should do a lot more of it. Problem is, I'm pretty much out of free casting glass. The remainder of free glass frit that I have, I've promised to students for their projects.So, I got a bit of a problem here. I got the skills, I got the kilns, I got the time. I got no raw material.I'll figure something out."},
{"title": "\"There's plenty of room at the bottom\"", "date": "Monday, September 10, 2012", "text": "Richard Feynman used this term in a lecture back in 1959, when he challenged the physics and engineering community to get going on the field of nanotechnology. There's a certain irony in the talk, as Feynman himself - and everyone in the room - was a product of a well-tested-and-proven four-billion-year-old version of nanotech we call biology.Some twenty-seven years later, Eric Drexler again lead the cheer for nanotechnology in a book called \"Engines of Creation\". How much the field had advanced - and it had, at least, say, in the realm of miniaturized electronics upon silicon substrates - since Feynman's talk was considerable, but still not nearly enough. Many of Drexler's predictions are not even close to coming to pass. Apparently, what Nature hath wrought through dumb luck is a little bit harder than imagined.In any case, what is interesting about Feynman's lecture is the opening line where he references the quest for the seemingly unlimited limits of cold:\"I imagine experimental physicists must often look with envy at men like Kamerlingh Onnes, who discovered a field like low temperature, which seems to be bottomless and in which one can go down and down\".Soon, this will all be on a chipOf course, Feynman exaggerated. We know there is such a thing as Absolute Zero, a limit that can never be reached, but the asymptotic approach is indeed bottomless. And the closer you get to absolute zero, the more interesting things get. I hate to bore people with this, but the more I read and absorb upon the subject of ultra-low temperature physics, the more my gut tells me there is something absolutely unexpected and technologically disruptive to be found there. There will be some type of remarkable breakthrough in our near future, perhaps not equivalent to nuclear energy or the commodification of information, but certainly up there with air conditioning or the Internet. What it is, I cannot say. Maybe something to do with the words \"quantum\". Something to do with atom chips, and matter lasers, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and complex optics, and the protean shapes of photons, and perhaps even sub-atomic manipulations.Or perhaps it will be a change of worldview more than anything else, something along the lines of the resurgence of curiosity and inquiry that occurred back in the 17th century (something which had been generally lacking in Western society for nearly 2,000 years).Take, for example, the recent work at the Vienna University of Technology (and is there something in the water at Vienna?), which reveals a very interesting intermediate state between chaos and order.Studies of matter at ultra-low temperatures shows that the process towards thermal equilibrium is much more complex than thought. It appears there is a regime of stable dis-equilibrium that can occur in between. Indeed, couple this with studies of the networking of networks, and it looks as if the concepts of chaos and order need to be tossed out completely. Even the idea of classical equilibrium may be nothing more than a concept - something that does not actually occur in the real world. If so, it may change how we thing about things, from climate change to markets. It may be that there is no such thing as a status quo, and thus, attempting to maintain it may be a fool's errand.Well, nothing new there, really. Expect the unexpected and all that. But still, I got a weird feeling going on from all this shit..."},
{"title": "Subsidize Me", "date": "Wednesday, September 5, 2012", "text": "My understanding is that America, while still a small nation huddled upon the shores of the North Atlantic, it's attention focused towards the ocean, possessed a not unimpressive presence as a maritime power. True, it was dwarfed by the powers of Continental Europe, and positively microscopic compared to British maritime might, but before the Civil War, a sizable fleet of clipper ships, whaling ships, and sailing packets plied both the Atlantic and Pacific. But this fleet had been in steady decline up to and including the Gilded Age.The usual causes listed for the decline are lack of government support, a shortage of private capital, and cheaper, subsidized foreign competition. My suspicion is that the nation's attention was turned towards the vast lands west of the Appalachians, that we were too busy securing a continental Empire to be too concerned with maritime matters. After all, throughout the 19th century, with protective tariffs and a large protective moat of two oceans to insulate us, we were more concerned with internal development than finding a place in the world. Certainly Europe thought very little of America, or Americans, backward, technologically primitive, and we Americans, as usual were playing the distinctly American game known as Catch Up.Does it seem that I have an overly condescending view of America? Well, for an exceptionalist America, certainly.You really have to wonder about a country that, coddled, isolated, gifted of a plenitude of unspoiled natural resources, promoted chattel slavery and thus was favored of a cheap labor force, still couldn't seem to break even with a Europe that had only a tenth the advantages. Why, look at Germany, for all practical purposes a medieval society well into the 1860s, still managed to economically, scientifically, and technologically outpace and outperform America in a mere twenty years. Socialist institutions, anyone? You could ask the ghost of the Iron Chancellor.But medievalism does seem to be the watchword for the first half of 19th century America. This is not to say medievalism is wrong or backward, far from it! Any number of that mechanical inventions and improvements were prevalent. But America, gifted with vast forests and free land, where it was easier and more profitable to be a farmer than an artisan, really had no need to develop an economy of skilled laborers, let alone a specialized work force need for an industrial economy. True, at the Great Exhibition of 1851, American furniture and woodworking craftsmanship was considered unsurpassed, and the quantity of machines for the mass-manufacture of wood products second to none. But America, squandering its forests and talents, soon lost out to other nations.But getting back to that maritime issue. The most advanced, most complex, most powerful machines on the planet, form the 1860s at least until the 1950s were the ocean liners. The amount of national prestige and pride that could be funded through government coffers made naval architecture the most advanced and most accelerated technological arena of the age. Any and all scientific advances were quickly incorporated into the designs of ocean liners - from steam turbines, to electricity, to radio, to computational physics (in the areas of hull and propellor design).The latter half of the 19th century, and well into the early 20th saw an accelerated Darwinian arms race of ocean liner building... unless you happened to be America. British liners were top of the line, the Apollo program of the 19th century. It was only when British engineers, perhaps after the development of the Parsons steam turbine, conservatively rested upon their laurels, that they fell behind in the race.Charles Parsons himself was bedeviled by the conservative mindset of the British Admiralty. More than happy with their clunky reciprocating piston powered engines, Parsons was continually denied an audience to demonstrate his steam turbine. He was forced into the role of cheeky bastard, crashing the 1897 Naval  Review at Spithead, where, in his hundred-foot-long ship Turbinia, ran circles around the plodding battleships and cruisers. Queen Victoria herself took notice.America did not have the technical know-how, but it did have the money. The asshole cocksucker bankster J.P. Morgan, in an attempt to crush all competitors in the trans-Atlantic trade, bought out the White Star Line in head-to-head competition with the well-established Cunard. Germany's HAPAG, not to be outdone, reneged on it's profit-sharing agreement with White Star. Kaiser Wilhelm II called it a \"scheme by the American plutocracy to prostrate Germany, if not Europe itself\".All ocean faring nations promptly provided large government subsidies to promote their industry. Morgan meanwhile, had two ships built for White Star, the Olympic, and ... the Titanic.J.P. Morgan, a morose and vilified man died in 1913. The last year of his life had seen not only the Titanic disaster, but the antitrust Pujo hearings in Washington. His downfall was certainly not worth the lives lost.American naval architecture languished throughout this entire period, having to wait for the enlightened and progressive policies of - and substantial government subsidies funneled through - the US Navy."},

If there is one certain thing that civilized man knows, it is do the exact opposite of what Newt Gingrich proposes.Following the George Costanza strategy, in realizing that every motivation possessed of Newt Gingrich is vile, venal, small, selfish, short-sighted, mean-spirited, half-baked, and superficially witless; that every single decision for the country he has ever made has been wrong; the nation should thus do the exact opposite of whatever it is that soft-serve shit-of-a-man proposes.To do so (the opposite of everything Gingrich recommends) would see an American hegemony last for the next thousand years. Well, fortunately, pretty much everyone who has a say on the subject thinks that returning to the gold standard is a monumentally stupid fucking idea. Of course, that should clue you in that it makes perfect sense to Republicans, along with a lot of other really cool ideas, like austerity (because that is working so well in Europe), and redefining rape as a legitimate act between a man and a woman.You know, back in the late 80s/early 90s, business went through a quality fad. W Edward Demmings had had good success in Japan. All sorts of quality gurus popped up proclaiming that quality was the magic pixie dust that would turn around a moribund business environment. Nobody stopped to consider that maybe the Japanese success story through Dr. Demming's prescription might have been the combination of the two, or throw in a command economy, some combination of the three. But, pixie dust is like cocaine, and once you are on it, it's hard to kick the habit. I read a book by a self-proclaimed quality guru named Tom Peters. After about a chapter in, I realized the guy was full of horse-shit and that the quality fad was just that - a fad.Interestingly, Newt Gingrich read the same book, and, being the supercilious, shallow, sloppy-thinking, little rectal orifice that he is, saw in it the basis for a popular revolution of government. Legend has it that Gingrich's meetings with freshman congress-people - complete with a Powerpoint presentation! - was a confused clusterfuck which had to be postponed again and again as word arrived that all of those quality methods Gingrich lauded... didn't work (hah!).

Sooner rather than late, I hope.In the meantime, I was considering an update of the Invasion of the Body-Snatchers scenario, but more in terms of Occupy Humanity.

{"title": "Book Report: \"The Servant Economy\" by Jeff Faux", "date": "Sunday, August 19, 2012", "text": "\"The future ain't what it used to be\". --Yogi BerraI had a tough time working my way through The Servant Economy by Jeff Faux. Not because it is intellectually challenging or particularly long, but because it is just one long descending downer of a book. Faux digs a really deep hole for the protagonist known as Uncle Sam, and in the end, doesn't provide much of a rope to get him out again. Of course, anyone who has paid any attention to long-term forecasting of world trends pretty much expects some type of cynically dystopian future, but Faux keeps on hammering until not even Old Sam's top hat is showing.As usual, I ended up dog-earing the pages of nearly a quarter of the book with memorable quotes. I'll not inflict them upon you, merely to say that, if you haven't thought much about so-called \"free trade\", you'll be thinking a lot about it afterwards.Working our way backwards, the narrative goes something like this: Can we really expect the United States of America, 5% of the world's population consuming 25% of its resources, to continue enjoying the pampered lifestyle of the post-WWII boom years? When the 21st century will require 2.5 Earths to continue the mandatory 3% compound growth of Anglo-Saxon (or Chinese Command and Control) Capitalism? Especially when the ruling class (I'm sorry, but I can no longer call them the governing class plus supporting business partners) has deemed the global extractive network system for the exclusive use to the highly inclusive and sequestered top-earner's club for basically ever?To quote from the opening page, anyone who has paid any attention to current events recognizes that:Most Americans had experienced stagnant real incomes, shrinking financial security, and fraying social safety nets.The nation had been buying more from the rest of the world than it had been selling and was borrowing to finance the difference.Despite the erosion of U.S. economic power, the governing class - Democrats and Republicans alike - insisted on maintaining its global hegemony, whatever the cost. Faux understands that, like all superorganisms, the United States will continue for a good long century or three past it's prime, mainly through hysteresis of power. It's got the soft and hard power, the connections, the street cred and reputation, and, yes, the monkey clever shrewdness, the utter callousness, and sheer brutality to keep it all going. America will be long in its decline (if the world's land, air, and oceans can hold out), but Americans will not.To further quote, the nation is no longer rich enough to continue to finance America's three principal national dreams:The dream of the business elite for subsidized, unregulated capitalismThe dream of the political elite for global hegenomyThe dream of the people for a steadily rising standard of living. So, uh, guess which dream goes unfulfilled? Ah, you guessed it, number 3!Faux spends the first two parts of the book providing a clear synopsis of American politico-economic history up to the first term of Obama, and does a very nice job of succinctly explaining how America, with no competition in a bombed-out world of the latter 20th century, quickly lost its pampered status by around 1978. The good times could never have lasted, regardless. Nixon (the last liberal, yes, I think so) attempted to keep the good times of the New Deal going. Carter attempted to introduce the nation to an adult conversation about our place and future in the world (and also planted the seeds of privatization which led to the Age of Reagan that we are still in). Reagan told everyone to go back to bed and sleep late, have a Sunday brunch, while dismantling public institutions and crippling labor and private industry through \"free trade\". And every president since Reagan (including our Blue Dog President Obama) has been stuck in his sandbox, financial kitty turds and all.Faux presents the argument that any way out of our natioanl dilemma involves a Catch 22 of government intervention - in the form of a strategic long-term social and industrial plan not unlike what successful \"socialist\" countries such as Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Finland have pursued. The catch is the American public not only distrusts government, they consider it far more inept and inefficient than private industry (despite all evidence to the contrary). The ruling class, no slouches they, realize as much, but since they are not hurting, and the hurt applied to the poor, working poor, and middle class has zero effect on them, they have no reason to change the trends.So, our bleak future extends to the horizon. This is part 3 of the book. The interesting thing to note is, despite the intolerable conditions our inept and incompetent elite fuckups have put us under, Americans endure all sorts of shit. We don't revolt. We just bitch. We may revolt. And if it happens, one would expect about the same as any other modern revolution, which is to say, chaos, anarchy, and then a return to power of a different flavor of incompetent fuckup, who generally is still controlled by the ruling class. There is, of course, the ever present threat of right-wing dictatorship here in America. One has only to look at our national character when pushed to the wall (vis the Tea Party faction of the Republican Party, or the \"sovereign citizens\" movement of ugly nihilism and irrationally violent self-interest). This is not to say we don't have our positive attributes of altruistic community activism, but power being the thing that it is, I'll bet ugly wins out.However, entropy being what it is, and laziness a major component of the American landscape, it is doubtful we will enter a Road Warrior future. Instead, look to even more frayed and tattered social systems and institutions, a shoddy and increasingly unsafe, shabby, and ugly infrastructure of roads, bridges, sewers, power grids, buildings, and water systems. An increasing concentration of privilege and opportunity towards the favored and fortunate rich, much less so for everyone else. Increases in illiteracy, innumeracy, previously preventable endemic disease, poverty, want, and squalor. In short \"A Third World nation with First World prices\". Or, if you will, as it turns out, the inevitable finale of Western Capitalism circa 2030, ironically, is Soviet Russia circa 1978. Fun times ahead! But Faux gives you some one hundred pages of the fun stuff. In more agonizing detail! If only there had been charts and graphics to ease the pain.Is there any hope? Faux argues not from either party, and don't expect a moderate third party to appear.Under the Democrats, it's takes a little longer for things to turn to shit. Under the Republicans (especially if they end up with all four portions of the government this fall), things very quickly turn to shit. (Perhaps as early as 2014).Faux argues for some transformational politics (short of revolution). Well, but only if we don't have to rely upon the American people for it. At least not the current crop, who seem to have swallowed the conservative line of bullshit so far the hook is lodged deeply in their collective craw. If helping others is \"socialist\" or \"commie\", if those living under less fortunate circumstances than you are considered \"lazy\" \"moochers\" and \"parasites\", if you feel you owe your to wealthy, then, damn, you are just a fucking slave, and go lick the boots of the rich that ride in on you.Faux offers a short piece of rope, and I've heard the suggestion before from OWS, a constitutional amendment to deny the personhood of corporations and eliminate corporate political donations. I see that as fairly ineffectual, and highly unlikely to come to pass. Progressives? OWS? No, especially given the monumentally execrable public relations ineptitude that resulted in the nation considering the OWS movement as a \"hippies looking for handouts\" joke. It was a terribly managed image formation, but not surprising, given funhouse lens it passed through via the corporate media.It's a very depressing book, in keeping with the times, but worth reading. It will suck the hope out you, as it did me, temporarily, but as a cynical optimist, I'm not quite ready to move to Norway or Finland - or start building IEDs - just yet."},
{"title": "Aluminum Sculpture in Grant Park", "date": "Saturday, August 18, 2012", "text": "Here's a quick follow up on the sculpture I helped assemble for the weekend sculptor guy. It got installed yesterday near Grant Park, just east of LSD by the lake. Here's a picture. It doesn't look all that bad.The sculpture is all aluminum, about eight feet high by twelve long. Maybe six feet wide at the widest. Total weight is probably around six to seven hundred pounds, and I felt every pound on my back at one point or another. (See the curvy tall wedge on the left hand end? That connects to the remainder via an internal pipe, and I hefted the whole thing up with my legs while they fastened it together. I think I'm rated to near 1,000 pounds, but don't tell OSHA).I received (checking myself out right now, naked, and did you really need to know that?) twenty bruises, thirteen superficial cuts and scrapes on the fingers and arms, one deep cut on my right forearm, a knot on the head, four 2nd degree burns (all on the fingers), an abrasion on my knuckle from a slip at the belt sander, another from grinding a point on a tungsten electrode for the TIG torch, sore muscles (still!) and one ruined pair of jeans.In payback, I welded about forty feet of seamed edges, ground down same footage, sanded and buffed about one hundred square feet of sheet metal, and probably sent a good ten pounds of aluminum powder and chips to the landfill. I honestly don't know how many grinding wheels, sanding belts, and emory cloth we went through.Hearing about how fine aluminum powder can be explosive, we tried setting it on fire. No dice.Now, I finally get to work on my own shit. Not quite as big."},

The restrooms now have those motion or obstruction activated soap dispensers and the Dyson airblade hand dryers. In a nice little marketing symphony, the soap dispensers cater to your infantile behaviors, in that, when they dispense soap, a little motor noise and a blue light is activated, so that you get a Fisher-Price reward with the foamy soap cum into your fingers. The airblade dryers, on the other hand, freak me out, in that they look and feel like they are going to chop your hands off at the wrist. All this, I suppose in our fruitless and fetishistic American quest for decontamination.Me? I agree with George Carlin. An immune system needs PRACTICE! And, like George, may he rest in peace, I wash my hands when I get shit on 'em, which happens two-three times a week TOPS!Anyway, back when I had a real job, I once worked in a ten-story glass and steel building whose floor plan looked like a rectilinear lightning bolt. You know, rather than a slant bolt, there was a right angle kink in the lines, kind of like the straightened-out sig rune used in the old Nazi SS insignia.For a time, I had a cubical on the fifth floor that was at the internal corner of the lightning bolt. And soon after I and others was moved there, we noticed that pigeons kept on slamming into the glass windows. It got to be regular thing. Bam! Bam! slammed the pigeons, almost two or three times a day.At first, we all figured, well, stupid pigeons. But then, one day, I happened to be in another part of the building delivering some kind of useless data print out to some drone executive, and I noticed his office had a bird's eye view over to the cul-de-sac pigeon death window target barrier. And there I saw something hilarious.It turns out a flock of crows were regularly herding pigeons into that barrier. One or two crows would scare a flock of pigeons and chase them down the length of the building towards the internal corner. The pigeons would head right for the windows, and then in an attempt at aeronautic skill, try to veer off to the left at the last moment. But, a second group of crows would dive down at the pigeons from the roof, cutting off their escape route. The pigeons, trapped and panicked, would slam right into the windows. They would fall stunned to the ground, probably with broken necks, and then the crows would eat them.Stupid pigeons? No. Smarter crows.To me, this demonstrates the difference between r-type and K-type selection, and their role in competition. So, in evolution, r-type selection for survival is basically the Chinese Wave \"overwhelm with sheer numbers' strategy - usually involves making a whole bunch of babies, not investing too much time or effort in raising them, and accepting large losses so that just enough survive. Insects do this a lot, prey species do this, and, for the largest part of American history, corporations with cheap mass production of shoddy goods. K-type selection for survival involves a small number of offspring, heavily invested in terms of time, energy, and information, and with a very high survival rate into adulthood. Predators typically use this strategy.The interesting thing is people don't seem to recognize these two variations of competition, or that one can use different strategies, or even switch them.So, you got pigeons and crows, if that's a competition. Perhaps a better example is the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during WWII. The Germans spent a great deal of time and effort producing small numbers of high quality, superior tanks, like the Tiger II. The Soviets cranked out the T-34s and the KV-1 and -2, often with the casting seams and welds not ground down to a finish on them. Why bother? Most would be blown up within the week, and they did not need to be pretty, just functional, and plentiful. Well, aside from the ghastly strategic ineptitude of Herr Hitler, there was still a mismatch of numbers on the battlefield. The Tigers could take out the T-34s, but there were many more of them. This would be the ongoing horrifying r-type strategy of the Soviet Union involving men and materials, and we know how that went for the Nazis.How about the opposite outcome? Has there been something like this? Well, again, look to Germany. They produce high quality industrial products which, in the commercial marketplace, are in heavy demand. The shoddy methods of the Americans and Chinese allow for a larger number to be produced, but the choice, when it matters, always favors the German product. If, as a craftsman, I plan on abusing the tool, I'll get an American or Chinese POS. If, on the other hand, the tool will have limited or specialized use, or the job required more efficacy of control and consistent results, the German is favored.Strangely, when applied to people, it generally doesn't work out quite as you would expect.Take, for example, the labor history of America. Here you have a country specially coddled and protected for centuries, possessed of a natural moat in the form of two oceans, with no real military competition on the North American continent. Plentiful \"free\" land to the west, with some of the most productive soils in the world, provided a source for growth and a safety valve against class unrest to the ruling elites of the eastern coast. Couple this to government largesse towards business interests and a willingness practice trade protectionism through tariffs, and one would assume that things would be good for the working man. With labor was a scare resource - even with growing population of immigrants - one would assume, as Benjamin Franklin did, that this would result in high wages for workers. Prior to around 1850, this was true, but soon enough, the opposite became the norm. But from 1845 through the next ten years, the US population grew by an astonishing 30% (way beyond the biological maximum of the \"native\" settlers) as immigrants escaped the strife and unrest of (failed) revolutionary Europe. Labor was artificially made surplus by the bottlenecking of immigrants in the slums of eastern cities through a) the political obstruction of territorial settlement by aristocracy of the Southern states, and b) a series of deeply recessionary economic upsets brought about by corruption, fraud and stock market manipulations. Fortunately (for immigrants), the Civil War broke the logjam on Western settlement, and a social crisis was averted. Nevertheless, the business elite, noting that mass unemployment depressed wages, took note, and did everything they could to continue the trend. As a results, through ruling class ineptitude, a nation that, by 1870, should have had the largest economy in the world, produced no more than 8% of global GDP. Germany, by contrast, with none of the advantages of the United States, accounted for as much, and with much higher literacy rates and scientific accomplishments.Do we have to ask what Germany was doing right, and the US was doing wrong? Short answer? Public social programs, coordinated industrial and economic policies, strong public education, maybe?Yeah, well, you know what? I've kind of run out of steam writing this essay. I guess my brain hasn't fully recovered from doing robot work the past two weeks. so, maybe I'll add more to this later when I can think coherently."},

Not to mention sore muscles. And I recently acquired a close to  world record 2nd degree burn blister on my right index finger, where I had to hold a bracket while it got welded in place, and it set my leather welding glove on fire, but I had to keep holding on till the job was done. I then threw the burning glove to the floor, but too late, I got myself a burn. I need to figure out a clamp that works on nonmagnetic metals. An articulated clamp. I actually, I did, but I can't say more in case it is patentable (which means I do a google search).So, I've been behind on my science news reading (which is the only news that is news).I'm starting to suspect that my prediction regarding ultracold things may have some legs to it. The topic of atomtronics is starting to heat up. Plus, some scientists in Germany are starting to figure out how to cool down large masses to near absolute zero. So, the industrial mass production of supercold shit seems to be inevitable. I look forward to the cool things that will come out of left field as a result of this. Other news. I know wireless power has been a dream going back to Tesla. I also know that small devices can be powered via radio waves. No they have figured out how to cheaply mass produce devices that are powered by radio waves. These funny little patches are conceived to be used for information on things like price tags, logos, and signage similar to the way QR codes are used.But, as I surmised with QR code abuse, I can't help but think that these rectenna devices could be used to load malware on your mobile. And, given that they are cheap to produce, and fairly innocuous and easily hidden, what's to stop people from leaving them everywhere? No worse than what occurs now with mobiles, I suppose, but, a little computer patch on a dumpster or a bulletin board sign ready to upload a virus to your mobile makes life just a little more interesting for the plugged-in.Me?

No, he doesn't dress sharply enough for that.Those ill-fitting suits he wears, trying to bulk that skinny frame of his, but basically caricaturing him into more of the look of the Beaky Buzzard from Bugs Bunny, just aren't cut well enough for a Satanic fashion statement.I met some Satanists (Laveyan Satanists) in Bellingham, Washington one time, and they looked sharp.  I mean really sharp. Like Milan Fashion Week on the catwalk sharp. He was dressed in a black pinstripe banker's suit that easily set him back a grand. She wore just a skin tight slinky black silk dress with a slit up the side and six-inch stiletto heels to show off her shapely gams. I think they wanted to do me, but, I'm just not the submissive victim type, so we will never know how that scenario would have played out.So, the connection? Satanism? Paul Ryan? Answer: Ayn Rand.I love that part of the clip where Clara Edwards from the Andy Griffith show shouts out \"Hail Satan!\"Ayn Rand was a Satanist? No.Anton Lavey borrowed heavily from her pseudo-philosophy known as Objectivism, which was informally laid out in books like The Fountainhead, and Atlas Shrugged. The core morality being \"It's Okay to Be a Selfish Asshole\" (not surprising, considering Ayn Rand was a narcissistic, manipulative sociopathic type).Most people who are exposed to Ayn Rand are exposed when they are young and their personalities not fully formed, or fully malformed and irredeemable. My take is Paul Ryan, pampered and privileged offspring of a well-to-do business dynasty in Janesville, WI, who - aside from a brief turn at burger flipping at McDonald's - has never had a real job in his entire life (according to John Boehner's standards), was the perfect stooge to fall prey to that particular diseased mindset. You know, indoctrinated into social darwinism, and the view that their world consists of heroic business suits battling a dystopian business-hating America, where workers exploit bosses, grasping bureaucrats set up obstacles to success, and parasitic nuisances siphon off valuable capital to support cadillac welfare lifestyles of hedonistic substance abuse and irresponsible procreation. And clearly, in an Orwellian ethical judo flip, altruism breed sloth, unfettered capitalism is morally upright, derangement is sanity, might is right, and devil take the hindmost.

A plan involving, in the short term at least, a President Romney, a Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, a Speaker of the House Eric Cantor, and a Paul Ryan to do play havoc with a federal budget into the year 2020?Starting with the now-vilified Alan Greenspan, acolyte of Rand, trying to fuck up the economy as much as possible, leaving hard-working decent Americans vulnerable and questioning their better judgement, to the point where \"every man for himself\" is starting to sound pretty good. A world where, clearly, things like stewardship, service, integrity, helping others, are all fruitless and naive superstitions. A world where one should feel on the right side of history, with a proud and assertive lack of compassion fro the less fortunate. A world where lack of a social conscience is an advantage. A world where the best possible solution to all problems involves the abandonment of any societal support, which serves only to enervate the already weak and inferior individuals. That which does not kill you makes you stronger.Might as well be Anton LaveyThe only missing ingredient in Ayn Rand's fucked-up reality-denying worldview, the one sane concession that Anton Lavey made was the rejection of the \"no force or fraud\" argument supposedly propounded by Objectivists. I say \"sane\" in the sense that force and fraud is recognized as part of reality. It occurs. It exists. It is a part of the universe. Why, capitalism would not exist without force and fraud. Why Rand chose to deny this I cannot say.Fraud exists at the genetic level. There are creatures that pretend to be what they are not. Harmless flies and snakes that pass themselves off as dangerous bees and venomous snakes, among just a few examples. And if Nature pulls it off, why, it's almost benign when compared to capitalism, which generally consists of lying, cheating, and stealing. Fraud exists as a long-term, systemic, routine conduct in the business world. Fraud is such a regular feature that it is only rarely prosecuted as a crime. At best, punishment, if it occurs at all, exists only as civil actions, arbitration, lawsuits, with no admission or denial of guilt.  Financial services regularly promote and push dodgy stocks, game the market, manipulate prices, and use insider information for personal gain. What could be more rationally self-interested than that?And force? The entire three hundred year history of capitalism, from the first stock trades in Holland and England, to the conquest of the American West, could not have occurred at all without the forceful extraction of talent, labor and resources. Why, is there any counterfactual possible where the Western world enjoys world preeminence without the conquest and subjugation of the New World? Without chattel slavery? Impossible!So, the whole \"no force no fraud\" principle is just one big wet turd of a delusion. At least the Satanists recognize that. Do libertarians? Does Paul Ryan? Ron Paul? Rand Paul? The people who insist that there be no governing except for the police, the courts, armed services, perhaps some infrastructure, but all the rest, regulations, public health, education, provisions for the general welfare, gone, or only as privatized services on a for-profit basis, in short, anything public that attempts to deter force and fraud? Allow me to fucking guffaw in derision.So, let's not kid ourselves. The soul of the nation, if it has not been forever tainted in cynical denial, is now currently being fought over by the satanic forces of the Randians, versus those of us who still believe in community. And I hate to be a Manichean drama queen about all this, but I for one feel that we need to recognize those who would send us down the path of Rand and libertarianism, the Tea Party stooge faction of the Republicans as, yeah, Satanically Evil."},

{"title": "Industrial Nucleonics Revisited", "date": "Thursday, July 26, 2012", "text": "Praxair: courtesy PJ Singer @ CitydataOn a drive back home from Chicago on I90/94, I will pass the Praxair facility, where they have three air separation towers. (During the holidays, they put christmas lights on top to make them look like candles, aww). The towers use a cryogenic air separation technique that goes back to Carl Von Linde's laboratory setup in 1895. With the compression, refrigeration, and liqufaction of air (originally for pure scientific purposes, and based upon refrigeration techniques developed as early as 1853 by J.P. Joule and W. Thompson) Linde quickly realized he could adapt the technique for industrial purposes to produce separate bottled gases of exceptional purity. Not surprisingly, the output is reflective of our source atmosphere, with nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%) the largest products, followed by carbon dioxide, argon, neon, krypton, xenon, etc.Fast forward to 1911, Heike Kammerlingh Onnes, the brilliant Dutch physicist, has recently produced liquid helium in his veritable factory of a physics laboratory at Leiden. When he dropped mercury into the liquid helium, he noticed that the mercury lost all resistance to electricity at the frigid temperature of 4 degrees Kelvin (-452F). The mercury sample had become a superconductor. Over time, many other materials - at much higher but still very cold temperatures - were found to become superconductors.Various explanations were proposed, but in 1957, three physicists, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, Robert  Schrieffer, developed what is now called the BCS theory of superconductivity, in which it was explained that electrons form Cooper pairs in an interaction with the cooled media - basically, within the lattice of atoms they are paired up by vibrations called phonons. That's the standard explanation for zero electrical resistance, but what exactly are Cooper pairs and are fermions (particles subject to the exclusion principle) the only beneficiaries of this phenomenon?The other curious beast of the supercold realm is the BEC: the Bose-Einstein Condensate. BECs are dilute collections of atoms that, when cooled down, start to behave as if they have lost their individual identities: as if the entire collection of atoms is one big atom.The rather naive observation, that these regimes seemed to share a superficial commonality, made me wonder, if electron can form Cooper pairs in a BCS system, why not other particles? More specifically, could free neutrons form Cooper pairs in a BEC? Neutrons when confined in a nucleus are stable, but free neutrons, outside of the stabilizing field of the nucleus, for whatever reason, tend to beta decay into protons after about fifteen minutes.  Why? I don't know. Would coupling of neutrons as a Cooper pair increase their decay lifetime? I don't know, but a few nights ago, it prompted this comment some few essays back:\"It occurred to me the other night (and I wasn't even stoned) that one should be able to get neutrons to pair up like Cooper pair electrons in a superchilled environment, and get a BCS-BEC (Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer) - (Bose Einstein Condensate) crossover, kind of a paired superconducting neutrons, a lased di-neutron beam, and sure enough, you can do it. Dig that!\"Admittedly, it all now sounds rather geeky and masturbate-y. Nevertheless, it turns out I'm not the only one that has asked this question (although of course, the lased di-neutron beam portion would be politely snickered at). But it's nice top know my hunches pan out more often than not.So, there are a number of questions I ask. What exactly is a Cooper pair?Neutrons are electrically neutral, which a neutron beam cannot be manipulated as proton and electron beams can. But neutrons do have a magnetic moment and spin, which means they can be manipulated in extremely strong magnetic fields, in the realm of 2-3 Tesla (the Earth's magnetic field strength is 31-58 microTeslas, depending where on Earth you measure). Can a thermally cooled, Cooper paired neutron beam be more easily manipulated?These attributes - superconductivity, superfluidity - seen at near-Absolute zero temperatures, are also seen at extremely high temperatures: namely, the quark-gluon plasmas at the beginning of the Universe, and also re-created in places like the RHIC in Brookhaven. Is there a connection? How to exploit it if  so?One hundred years after the first successful production of liquid helium (a mere 60 cubic centimeters first produced in 1908), some 193 million cubic meters are now produced. 96 metric tons of liquid helium is used to cool the superconducting magnets in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.I've got to wonder, how long before Bose-Einstein Condensates are mass produced and used on a comparable industrial scale? Given current trends, my $1 bet is 2030 at the latest. And then? And then what?Although neon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe, argon is 500 times more abundant in our atmosphere. This is so because neon is lighter than argon, and most probably escaped Earth's atmosphere a very long time ago. Argon is important in industry as a welding gas. I have a hunch though, that neon may turn out to be much more important in the long run.And then? Then what? Well, if I knew what the industrial applications of BECs beyond current applications were, I wouldn't tell you. I'd tell a tech investor. But my guess is, the obvious applications (nano-fabrication/ultra-precise measurements/quantum information and computing) will not be the real true industrial application. My guess is it will be something that, if we now, would make us shit our pants in astonishment.But my guess is, to borrow from the movie \"The Graduate\", the word of the future will be \"phonons\"."},

And so, we should avoid using the name of... what was his name again?Oh, right. James Eagan Holmes.My problem with this is these mass murders occur so frequently, that it is hard to even remember the last rampage killing, let alone the victims, let alone the murderer. So, what the last one? Fort Hood, Texas? Tucson, Arizona, where Gabby Giffords was mutilated? What were the names of those guys, the maniacs that shot people up? I couldn't tell you. I don't think most people could.And all those thirty-some-plus mass killings over just the past ten years, those are just the ones categorized as mass shootings. What about the gang violence? What about homicides? Here in Chicago, as of July 18th, we've had a murder rate worse than the casualty rate in Afghanistan. Worse than a fucking war zone.How is it going around the nation? Well, the statistics run about 84 people shot to death per day.Courtesy Kieran Healy @ kiernhealy.orgNow, the typical weasel logic from the John Wayne can-plinkers and wannabe Rambo range-shooters will invoke a red herring fallacy along the lines of \"guns are only tools\", or \"more people die from automobiles than guns\". Well, you know, I'm always using my gun to drill holes in wood and open cans of beer, and, if the sole purpose of cars was to put holes in people, then we might possibly be worried about that auto-related death statistic. But clearly, such arguments are fucking bullshit.Do we even have to cover the horse-shit argument that, if everyone carried, the incidents for gun violence would drop? Because, you know, it was so satisfying to hear that James Holmes was dropped in a hail of return fire from the movie going audience. What? That didn't happen? But surely there were people in the audience that were packing heat, right? What they doing, aside from undergoing some unfortunate bodily accident? Whimpering and crawling towards the exits? Where is George Zimmerman when you need him? Stalking teenage kids who are packing skittles and ice tea?Anyone care to name the three people - two men and a woman - who tackled the the gunman who shot Gabby Gifford and others? Were they armed? They were not? There was one person lauded by the right-wing gun-licking press who was packing heat, and he was fortunate enough not to draw. Because he would either a) shot the wrong person, or b) been taken down by cops. Of course, to gun owners, these facts are irrelevant. If only someone had been there to return fire, the loss of life would have been less severe.Oh, fuck you.Face it, despite all the pant-shitting from the NRA and the gun/toy rights crowd, the 2nd Amendment is not going away. Period. We will always have guns (currently 88.1 guns per 100 people - the highest ownership rate in the world). And, despite efforts to keep guns out of the hands of the deranged, the inept, and the unstable, those guns will be readily available.Face it gun owners, this is the price you pay to keep and bear arms. And these maniacs are the bill collectors. Ignoring them is not only dishonest, its delusional.At least have the common decency and honesty to recognize this fact and remember the victims who, regrettably (ah there's another weasel phrase)  are 'watering the roots of the the tree of liberty' with their blood, so that you can keep and bear arms against some ludicrous imaginary threat to your freedoms."},
{"title": "Word Substitution Game", "date": "Thursday, July 19, 2012", "text": "I've noticed the term \"job creator\" has been getting a lot less usage in the press lately. I suppose it's gotten to the point where it a parody of itself, certainly almost immediately for anyone with a thinking brain in their head. And so it is time to move to the next agit-prop catch-phrase, which seems to be \"job killer\".I know in my case, the phrase \"job creator\" became just another piece of noise. So much so, that I decided to substitute the word \"unicorn\" for \"job creator\", and it works pretty well. Consider this in an excerpt from a speech John Boehner made back in September of 2011:\"I can tell you the American people -- private-sector unicorns in particular --- are rattled by what they’ve seen out of this town over the last few years. My worry is that for American unicorns, all the uncertainty is turning to fear that this toxic environment for unicornation is a permanent state. Unicorns in America are essentially on strike.\"And for me it sounds perfectly in tune with the standard GOP song and dance put out by their number one market hack, Frank Luntz. Remember what Frank said:\"...there's a simple rule. You say it again, and you say it again, and you say it again... and about the time you are absolutely sick of saying it is about the time that your target audience has heard it for the first time\"The rest of us, those who have a hard time ignoring all the fucking noise coming out of Washington, are also sick of it.Given the current pitched battle occurring between liberals and conservatives over the role of the government in the direction of the economy, it is not surprising that usage frequency of the \"job killer\" phrase has increased probably a thousand-fold within the media over the past year. It has been used almost exclusively by Republicans, and usually invariably without any shred of attribution or fact verification.Therefore, since the phrase threatens to become nothing more than noise, I propose that a new term \"gargoyle\" be substituted. Thus, when the California Chamber of Commerce releases its annual List of Gargoyle Bills, I might actually be interested. Or when the Christian Science Monitor carries an article entitled \"Is Obama's tax plan a gargoyle?\", I'd be inclined to read it:   \"Conservatives say the tax plan will harm small businesses - the nation's top unicorns... Mr. Romney doubled down on this assertion at a campaign event in Grand Junction, CO saying that higher taxes on unicorns and small businesses' are the last thing the struggling economy needs'. 'That will gargoyle' Romney said at the event.\"Actually, you know what? That wasn't nearly interesting enough. And I am also tired of hearing the phrase \"double down\", and so will substitute \"dry hump\" for that, and then also I'm tired of hearing about taxes, and so will substitute \"big fat ass\" for that, and then also, while I'm at it, substitute \"bottom\" for business and \"penis\" for economy. So then we get: \"Conservatives say the big fat ass plan will harm small bottoms - the nation's top unicorns... Mr. Romney dry humped on this assertion at a campaign event in Grand Junction, CO saying that higher big fat asses on unicorns and small bottoms' are the last thing the struggling penis needs'. 'That will gargoyle' Romney said at the event.\"Of course, this also leads to awkward news items like \"voters disapprove of President Obama's handling of the penis\". Or \"Glenn Hubbard, one of Mitt Romney's top penis advisors is promoting some questionable penis theories\".Well, that sword cuts both ways."},
{"title": "Red Velvet Donuts", "date": "Wednesday, July 18, 2012", "text": "Donuts are the new cupcakes. I called it. I called it two years ago, and now, all those nay-sayers and pooh-pooh-ers, you can just eat my dust.One of my favorite donut places - open 24 hours - is Spunky Dunkers in Palatine, IL.  It's like a time-warp in there, with plump ladies in white outfits making old-fashioned hand-cut sugary donuts fried up in beef lard - or some kind of lard, I don't care what kind of lard, as long as it's lard, it's flavorful and exceptionally bad for you.I've yet to meet a donut I don't like in there. I have a particular fondness for some donuts more than others, but I'll display no prejudice against any of them. That's not the American way.One wonders if there could be some type of connecting symbolism between donut and characteristic attribute of the larger universe? Could it be that each denizen within that fabulous bestiary in turn represents some virtue or quality of nature? Could it be there should exist some metrical donut fable, some liturgical formulation, some fantastic ritual allegory waiting to be explored here?Or maybe I'm just display an unhealthy fetish. Homer Simpson-itis.Spunky Dunkers has a nice variety that includes among my favored the coconut, the blueberry cake, the strawberry ice ring, the buttercrunch, and, when in season, the peanut butter and jelly donut, with it's make-your-teeth-hurt sugary jelly filling and peanut butter cream topping.Ah, but now they have the new and particularly splendid red velvet donut with cream cheese topping.Son of a bitch!How good is it? Would I murder a small Western town in its sleep for a box of red velvet donuts with cream cheese topping?Well, no.Then again, I don't know. How many donuts would I get? If caught, is the death penalty death by red velvet donuts? Because, then, yeah, maybe. Probably. That's how good they are. That good.See, that don't look right.The thing is though, they do look not very appetizing. There's kind of a gruesome meat byproduct look to them. Not quite right. I don't know what they'd look like without the red food coloring, perhaps even worse. And honestly, it's just cocoa powder and sour cream that's making all the magic happen with the cake donut.Ah, anyway... I've gotten distracted, and here I was going to write about all the silly distractions the politicians have been flashing in front of our eyes.The upper class tax hike comes to mind. Back last August, when the Republicans created the fake debt ceiling crisis that cost the US of A a ghastly nick in its credit rating, and kept the unemployment rate up, Mitch Mcconnell realized that hostage-taking works. Problem is, the old reptile, running his pink pudgy fingers with the immaculately buffed nails over the knobs and levers of the parliamentary control panel, didn't seem to realize is that this particular behavior could be played by both sides. So now we got Democrats making noises about taking us all over the fiscal cliff if tax cuts for the rich are not ended.Talk about a red herring! Like raising income tax on the rich is going to have any effect at all - either on the take-home of the rich, or a dent in the deficits. Because it won't. That's not where the rich make their monies. They make it on carried interest and capital gains - and, for long-term gain, they pay a miserable 15% tax penalty.You know, there are at least four dumb - and I mean demonstrably, empirically dumb - ideas that get bandied about by the angry, flatulent white people: flat tax, term limits, third party, and balanced budget amendments. All of these ideas should be on a Jerry Springer episode entitled \"Simplistic Quick Fix Solutions and the Simpletons Who Love Them\".But it is interesting how, for all the people who talk about a flat tax on income, very few wonder about the effects the essentially flat capital gains tax has had upon the economy for the past ten years. Or at least maybe connect income disparity with this flat tax.Oh, wait. I just read they want to include a raise of the capital gains tax to 20%. Never mind."},

I think Rand Paul really is just a dumb, stupid, cynical mud-sucking fuck-wit of a opportunistic bottom-feeding demagogue. Some people may think I'm being too hard on Rand Paul. I don't who those people are, because I've yet to hear from anyone who thinks I am being too hard on him, but I'm guessing they are out there. Well, the fact of the matter is, seeing as stupidity is just another form entropy, and Life Itself does it's damnedest to be an-entropic, I figured I would side on the side of Life Itself against Rand Paul.The dumb motherfucker has been off my Buffoon Watch radar for awhile, but it seems he's putting in extra effort to get back on it. Aside from abusing the particulars (such as senatorial legislative holds and ridiculous amendments) of the Senate - those practices which our Founding Fathers, seeing as they set the minimum age at 30, rather seem to have hoped would be a gathering populated by sober, mature, reflective, intelligent, reserved adults - for his own childish and self-serving ends, Rand just can't seem to be able to speak or write anything that doesn't make him sound like he's arrested at the middle school level, both intellectually and emotionally. Did I say middle school? Perhaps something earlier, something involving playground humor and potty jokes is more Rand's style.When he isn't busy informing church folk that President Obama's views on marriage \"couldn't get any gayer\", or that, in an apparent return to adolescent bone-headedness regarding the Supreme Court's decision on the constitutionality of the ACA, that \"just because a couple of people on the Supreme Court declare something to be 'constitutional' does not make it so\". Because, you know, Rand Paul, conservative respecter of societal institutions, and not an bomb-throwing anarchist, mind you, is the final arbiter of what is and is not deemed constitutional. So there. I could on with a list of all his half-wit antics, but fortunately, Salon.com is keeping tabs on the trail of wet little turd droppings Rand Paul is leaving for posterity. The latest is a letter to the editor he sent to the Louisville Courier-Journal in response to editorials they have written about him that are all, like, mean-like, and they should be, like, nice to him and all. I don't feel the need to reproduce the whole letter, given that it is mostly standard political bullshit and partisan whining, but, I would like to direct your attention to one particular item. Perhaps it is a small item, but it speaks volumes about the pretensions of the Senator - and 2016 Presidential hopeful as his father continues to groom the lice off him like an old chimp - Rand Paul:\"Recently, the Courier-Journal editorial page took a number of pointed attacks at me, misrepresenting me and my efforts to serve the people of the commonwealth of Kentucky. I have approached legislating with a sense of moderation that seems to be lost on my critics, and I would like to clear the air. To be moderate is often held up as the paragon of modern political virtue. With apologies to the Bard, today’s narrative argues that: to be uncompromising is to err, to be moderate is divine-\"I hate to sound like your 7th-grade English teacher, Rand, but, uh.... That quote you just mangled? \"To err is human, to forgive divine\"? That was by Alexander Pope. Not Shakespeare. True, Pope was known as the Bard of Twickenham. But to capitalize The Bard is generally viewed as to refer to the Stratford-on-Avon guy. Which, with just a small amount of lazy googling, you could have avoided fucking up on. But see? Now everyone knows that you wrote this letter, Rand! Because your intelligent staff persons, the ones that roll their eyes from behind you on camera, wouldn't have committed a fuckup like that.Secondly, when writing an essay, you get you point out up front, and then argue it. So, your main point is? \"Despite what people say, I am a moderate\". So, what you don't want to do is then present being a moderate as something bad, since you present yourself as a moderate,  and, seeing as you've made your argument that moderation - bipartisanship, cooperation, reaching across the aisle,  doing good by the country - is bad, you're doing what now? And in the future, see if you can avoid using 'scare quotes'. That just makes you come across as some kind of a smarmy fuckface."},
{"title": "The Higgs", "date": "Wednesday, July 11, 2012", "text": "Yup, I guess it's time to comment on the Higgs. A few physics trivia in no particular narrative or point behind it.I guess it all started with QED. Quantum Electrodynamics. Talk to Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger about all that. Well, not now, they're dead.Schwinger took first crack at it, and figured it out, but the maths were exceedingly byzantine. Feynman, after a few stumbles, came up with the elegant Feynman diagrams still used today. The problem with a description of even just a simple electron, as, for example, described in Dirac's equation is a bit more messy and filled with infinities than is usually described in the media. Small wonder. It can't be reduced to a thirty second description. As Feynman put it, when pressed, \"If I could describe it in thirty seconds or less, it wouldn't be worth a Nobel prize...\"Here's my favorite. Think of a electron as a dot on a computer screen. All the charge is in one central pixel. You and I want to get a better look at it, so I increase the resolution and zoom in by hundredfold, so that the one pixel showing the electron is now one hundred pixels - a ten by ten square.Now, the electron's charge is... one central pixel. And surrounding it is ninety-nine pixels in a whirlpool of positive and negative virtual charges that pop into and out of existence. Okay, fine, zoom in another hundredfold.Now, the charge of the electron is... sonofabitch, one pixel. And surrounding that is an even more detailed and complicated whirlpool of positive and negative charges.Want to do it again? Because I think you know where this is going. Each magnification shows that crummy little electron as a single point charge in the middle of the screen, with an increasingly huge peacock tail of virtual particles surrounding it.QED has an infinity problem, which Schwinger and Feynman resolved by rewriting the equations to basically cancel the infinity part out. Cheating? No, it just looks that way.So, success! The electromagnetic force, with its accompanying boson (the particle carrying the electromagnetic force, called a photon) is successfully described mathematically, and, even better, produces an answer, when you chug through the equations, that matches reality.Okay, now what? It's 1950, and Abdus Salam starts working on a quantum mechanical description of the strong and weak atomic forces. How well does he do? Well, he does okay. He doesn't quite get all the way, but, with the help of John Ward, they start to construct a theory of the weak nuclear force.What is the weak force? (This is kind of important, because this is where the Higgs comes in). What is the weak force?I don't know. But I can tell you what it does. The weak force is responsible for radioactive decay and radioactivity. It basically is what causes one nucleus to transmute into another one (usually, but not always downhill). When a neutron decays into a proton (spitting out an electron and a neutrino), that's the weak force in action. The weak force essentially transmits charge (electric) from one particle to another - turning one nucleon into another.Take fusion in the sun, the strong nuclear force (not gonna cover it) squeezes four protons together, and the weak force converts two of the protons into neutrons, the four hydrogen atoms are transmuted into a helium. But the weak force is so feeble, that this does not always occur - so much so that, even after some 5 billion years, only half the hydrogen fuel in the solar core has been burned.Well, Salam and Ward, Feynman (get used to him) and Murray Gell-Mann, and eventually Shelly Glashow, and Steve Weinberg figured out the maths for this force description looked a lot like what had been done for QED, but a little more complicated.  (Basically, the hope was that the photon could be used as a weak force carrier, but, oh dear, the maths suggested a triplet was at work).So, they end up around 1964 or so, through various papers and arguments (and not a few physicists grabbing microphones in tears at conferences blubbering and sobbing \"I thought of it first, I just didn't publish in time. Honest, I did!\"), that the triple boson threat for the weak force consisted of two massive particles W+ and W-, and a massless boson dubbed Z0. (Z0 is also referred to as \"heavy light\" since it is the weak force counterpart to the photon - clever, huh?)So, now we are at a point where people are asking what they hey? Why all these bosons? And the answer increasingly seems to be: broken symmetry. When the universe was younger and hotter (temperature-wise), the weak and electromagnetic force where balanced and equal, and there was an underlying symmetry between the W, the Z, and the photon, which were at the time all massless. But as things cooled down, the symmetry broke, and suddenly the W gained mass, but the Z and photon did not.  This symmetry breaking, this W boson gaining a mass as the universe cooled down is where Higgs steps in.And actually not. Back in the 1960s, when this was all being worked out, there were six physicists each with one piece of the puzzle, called the \"Gang of Six\" - Francois Englert, Robert Brout, Tom Kibble, Gerald Guralnik, Carl (dick) Hagen, and Peter Higgs. All worked on what it now called The Mechanism as to how the symmetry got broken, but it was Higgs who published a paper concerning the boson.So that's the big deal. If you look around today, you don't see Higgs bosons. They existed in a younger, hotter universe, which is you need to use the LHC to see them. And all sorts of nonsense has been written up in the media about what it all means. Does Higgs give us a theory of everything? Fuck no!Theory suggest it gives mass to hadrons, which are all the particles that make up the visible matter in the universe - some 4% of the total mass of the universe. But that other 96% of matter we can't see? The so-called dark matter. Well, no one has a clue. Not Standard Model theorists. Not string theorists. So, there you go.Of course, the interesting thing is, the LHC is just at the beginning of its working life, so its probably got some empirical discoveries to go through.Of course, what I'm more interested in is... industrial nucleonics! Particle accelerators have yet to demonstrate their real tool usage to us? What do I mean by this? Well, take the laser. When it was first developed, everyone could think of obvious hillbilly uses for it like burnin' shit and blowin' shit up. But, lasers to read CDs and DVDs? Lasers used to cool matter down to a near Absolute Zero? Lasers that might be tractor beams, or for quantum computers? Get the idea?Particle accelerators, despite the fact they are being used for cutting-edge physics, are probably still only used for the hillbilly phase. True, they are used in medical imaging and cancer therapy, materials investigation, to produce isotopes, probably to be used for nuclear reactors and maybe fusion, but that's all the obvious stuff.For a while now, there is talk of table-top sized accelerators, and a group at Sandia has produced a neutron bran generator on a chip. Why just this past week, Los Alamos produced the most powerful neutron beam on the planet. Okay, cool! Do something cool with it! Something new. Something not thought of before. Like, I don't know, figure out how to manipulate with a Tesla sized magnetic field to produce a fusion engine. Or create a supercooled neutron laser, a matter laser, that can maybe manipulate a Bose-Einstein into hitherto unknown regimes of energy and space and time. Or perhaps create collapsium. Or a figure out a way to manipulate the weak nuclear force, or, oops, tap into the vacuum energy, like whoever it was that did it the last time, some 13. 7 billion years ago.Come on man! Do I have to think of everything?Wouldn't you know it that a cool phrase I just came up with would have already been used by some company from the 1950s?I tried an experiment this past Saturday. The heat wave broke about mid-day, and after getting my weekend job done in the afternoon, it was just too goddamn glorious out not to waste any time indoors. It had been nearly two months since I so painfully turned my foot running, and although there was still some visible swelling, sloshing liquid and pain around the torn ligaments, I figured let's go for a run. (And here is still more evidence that, despite the fact I feel like I'm eighteen, I am not. Had I turned my foot at the age of eighteen - which I no doubt did back then - I'd have been back to running in just a few days...) So, I went out running. I think the experiment was successful, in that, my injury did not get worse. I was intensely aware of my foot placement, posture, and all that other proper form and techniques covered in kinesiology. So, I no doubt looked like a dainty little fawn prancing carefully through the woods. (No, probably not, more like that bigfoot footage). In any case, the foot didn't hurt when I was running.I went for another run on Tuesday, and again, no pain during the run, as long as I run in a straight line.(Still hurts when I walk, and I can feel fluid jiggling around on the top side of my foot... so not the ankle I damaged, but the best guess is the long plantar ligaments, as the tops of my toes bruised up soon after).  Anyway, I 'm back to running, and about time too. I pretty much lost all my wind. Those elliptical machines? I'd be drenched with sweat on them and my legs would be shaking, and I still couldn't get myself out of breath. I really need my high impact aerobics and wind sprints to do the job on me."},

Funerals.I don't know what it is, the hidden stress, the nicotine bonding of the bereaved, the need to share? Whatever it is, I get a powerful urge to go up to the group puffing out side the funeral home and try to bum a smoke. I don't do it, but...This past weekend I attended a funeral of the father of friends of friends of mine - which makes them acquaintances. That seems to be the way it works as you get older. When you're young, you go to funerals of your closer orbiting social circles - friends and relatives. As you get older, those circles seem to expand outwards - possibly because as you get older more die than get married, but even so, it's um, it's some kind of community bonding, a respectful gesture, or perhaps just a gathering against the coming dark.The thing about this guy that passed is, he was maybe about six foot tall and weighed a good 650 pounds, easily. He was so fat - and this isn't meant as a fat joke, but - he was so fat, that he could have given birth to a fat person.He and his growing constituency seem to indicate that America needs a whole new category for being overweight. I mean, this guy was beyond morbidly obese. He pretty much immobile - barely able to negotiate his way out of bed, out to his chair in the garage. There, his buddies would come over and jaw with him, and do whatever chores he requested, and bring him beer and cigarettes. Since he and his buddies are all industrial rednecks that populate this rusted up region of Northwest Indiana, I can't help but think of him as an immobile hillbilly. And thus - an immobilly.Not to speak ill of the dead, but the other thing that really got to me was, when he checked into the hospital with a blood clot in his lungs and his kidneys shutting down, everyone assumed he would be out in a few week - because he was \"indestructible\".Indestructible.What an interesting use of the term, that a man could do such grotesquely unhealthy things to his body, turn himself into a soft-serve tub of goo, and be considered indestructible because he continues to survive.(Shaking my head here)."},

{"title": "Electric Jello", "date": "Thursday, July 5, 2012", "text": "Is there any image that is not a tattoo?The big news this week is out of CERN. Something about finding a particle. Some kind of Higgs boson. Or rather, that the scientists at the LHC have amassed enough evidence to suggest that they may have found a particle that corresponds to the Higgs boson - since it is within the right range of mass. It doesn't mean it is the Higgs, or even that the Higgs actually exists.The Higgs boson, after all, is a mathematical construct. It could be as real as an epicycle - a mathematical method used to explain the motions of the stars and planets under the assumption that the sun revolves around the earth. The mathematical theory behind epicycles explains the empirical data quite well. It's also completely fucking wrong.So it could be with the Higgs. There's a lot of work to do find out exactly what it is that the CMS experiment has \"found\", but that won't stop the press releases.As it happens, I'm reading a book detailing the history of quantum mechanics from QED to the Standard Model. I'll not bore you with the details, but suffice to say any detailed and accurate explanation of what the Higgs is all about would involve boring you with details.And actually I think there is a much more important science announcement this week coming out of Stanford U. A team there has developed electric jello. It's an electrically conductive gel that can be used to print circuits using an inkjet printer. It promises cheap printable electronics, and probably a method to interface biological systems with technological hardware. \"The researchers envision it being used in everything from medical probes and laboratory biological sensors to biofuel cells and high-energy density capacitors\". Not to mention I just may have to get that central-nervous-system-controlled animated cuttlefish tattoo on my arm that I have threatened to get if ever the technology allows it.Ah, well, I've never felt the need for personal adornment, and have misgivings about modifying mysefl. But I've probably a few years before this becomes a problem.Anyway, if it turns out I've made a mistake, I can always try and change the past, right? Google's XNet will have developed time travel by then, and I can just go back and say \"Don't that tattoo! It will be nothing but an embarrassment for you!  Some old fuck trying to be hip. It's pathetic. Worse, if you really are hip and old, it's just creepy! Don't do it!\""},

Each of them, in turn, had a particular favorite type of meat and starch combination they would eat, but vegetables? Salads? Even fruits? No way. As far as I can tell, from hearing from the sister-in-laws, still pretty true today. Meat and starch. It's probably why I am not a fat-fattie like they are.Me? I love vegetables. I lo-oove asparagus spears. I'm one of those people who's pee smells funny after they eat it. It turns out some people's pee doesn't smell funny, and they can't even smell the smell of your funny pee if they smell it.

{"title": "Maybe it's about the sulfur", "date": "Tuesday, June 26, 2012", "text": "My astrological birth sign is Taurus. According to astrology, we Taureans are sensualists. I gotta say that aspect of my personality seems to be called true by that branch of pseudo-science. Then again, who isn't a sensualist, given the option?The difference between the sensual and the merely sensory is, I think, the same as that between sentient and sapient. A robot is sentient. It senses things. It has sensory equipment. But it doesn't, as far as I know, appreciate or dislike the sensation. It doesn't have the brains to experience the experience.Or maybe it is transactional. The giving being as important as the getting - kind of like the difference between making a woman smile and making her laugh. Making a woman smile is a mildly pleasant experience. Making her laugh, ah, that's like giving her a mini-orgasm, which through the wonders of reciprocity and monkey-mirror neurons, is like sharing in that little mini-orgasm. Turns out the getting is multiplied by the giving. (Perhaps something the evolutionary psychologists such as Pinker can't get, or wretched greed-mongers like Ayn Rand, who spend too much time living in their heads instead of in their bodies).Well, specifically, today I had an incredible sensual experience in the form of a shower. We've had mostly cold, dry Canada air throughout the summer. What with the windows open, and me blessed with a water heater that produces tons of scalding water, I had an incredible shower experience this morning. Yeah, I know I'm repeating myself, but it was incredible. Incredible? It was almost overwhelming.I felt like the planet Mercury, with the sun roasting my belly to a crisp, and my ass facing the icy cold of space, slowly rotating as I could no longer bear it. Amd with my eyes closed, there was an added thrill that I cannot explain. And all the while, the steam filling the bathroom, but just for a moment as the thirsty air drew it all into itself.It reminded me of a shower experience out in Northern California. The lifestyle of the area is such that the border between the outdoor and indoor living is porous or nonexistent. Thus, the shower was on the back porch. So, couple that kind of naughty naked experience with the dry air and near boiling water jets, and it is a wonderful form of sensuality.But there was an element from my memory missing. The house was near the Pacific coast, and the water was well-water. The two incidents combined to add a fantastic sulfury smell which added tremendously to the experience. Oh, not the rotten egg smell of mercaptans and hydrogen sulfide, but rather the dimethyl sulphide smell of the ocean, and, uh whatever the various dissolved sulfates of the mineral water smell.The smell, combined with the extremes of temperature, and the laving touch of water, is, wow, what can I say, makes you feel great!So, yeah, that sulfur. Interesting, isn't it, how it can produce the wonderful salt air of the ocean, but then again also the horrendous marine stench of upturned anaerobic muck, or, beg pardon for mentioning it, but the depths of your bowels?You know, like when it take a shit that even you can't stand? Or when you cut a fart that makes peoples wonder as to what exactly it was that died inside you? That's sulfur, baby! And it is, I think, the real stuff of life!Alchemists, clueless as they were, seemed to have a clue at least in that department. Not that sulfur is that ineffable quintessence, but boy, try and make earthly life without it.Got carbon? Water? Nitrogen. Oxygen. Even phosphorous? All well and good. No sulfur? Biology, terrestrial biology, is out of luck.I am of the opinion that, with all the abiogenesis experiments that have been tried, and failing to adequately explain the origins of life, they are eventually going to have to set up the original comfort food conditions at the bottom of the sea, with those fumaroles of scalding hot water, laced to the point of supersaturation with minerals, getting pumped out into the icy cold blackness of the deepest sea water.Kind of like my shower experience."},
{"title": "Life Among the Mechas concluded", "date": "Friday, June 22, 2012", "text": "Front: (L to R) Ida and Will Parker, Yolanda Salazar, Ezra FurmanBack: Edward Hopper, Me Author's Note: I'm a little disappointed in this 3-part piece of fiction. I guess I'm disappointed because, even though it was meant as just a pleasant little diversion, the story still didn't end up as super-fucking awesome. It was silly to expect it. You have to get a little extreme to get super-fucking awesome, and pleasant divergences, mild explorations of pretty well-honed and established ideas and scenarios, tend not to be extreme. Maybe, in the future, I'll try to write something that scares the pants off people, but that's probably a hard thing to do nowadays, what with everyday reality already doing such a good job. In any case, I hate leaving things unfinished, and so I had to finish this, even though I'm not satisfied with it. Ho hum.Researchers using brain scanners can predict people's decisions seconds before the test subjects were even aware of making them. This has been repeated time and again, starting from the classic experiment carried out by Benjamin Libet. When most people find out about this, it gives them the creeps. They feel as if there is some alien computer inside their heads that is controlling them, and they - the part that is aware, the conscious part, the ego, the me part - are just along for the ride. This is considered creepy, because people would like to think they are at least in control of themselves. But they are their brains. The brains is them. So I fail to see what there is to get creeped out about.Of course, then you have to ask, if your brain is already deciding all these things, what does it need you  for? Well, silly question, but here's my answer. The way I figure it, a creature that can enjoy (or fear) an experience is more likely to be driven to seek out (or avoid) that experience than one that can't. Simple natural selection. Consciousness has survival value. The question then becomes, if your brain needs you, then what does it need a smart you for? Again, silly question. And again, my answer, my partial answer is that a smart human interactive module helps out tremendously when it comes to group selection. Groups composed of individuals whose brains have well-interacting front ends (human personalities) do better than those without. In other words, smart brains with personalities are mainly and mostly social. And that's what it boils down to I think. The Singularity (how did that come up?), with it's emphasis on personal freedom and powers, by being so rationally self-interested, is almost by definition of psychotically poor group fitness value, and therefore ultimately destined to be defeated by a more altruistic version of the future. Because, otherwise, honestly, the far, far future will have a big Welcome to Hell sign, with some fucking reptile-house-on-PCP, terminally-paranoid-and-deranged version of a survival-of-the-fittest God squatting on top of it all, with the philosophy that winning Heaven is not enough, all others must lose wretchedly, mercilessly ground under a thumb, forever and ever, amen.But, anyway, here's the other thing about that decision time lag. The reason your brain decides way before you do is that it takes a lot of time and energy to maintain you. Not only just you, that is, consciousness, but also to run all those behind the curtain neural machinations that allow you to do things like see and hear and touch and smell stuff, and to recognize it all pretty much instantaneously, and then make value judgements on it, all in tenths of seconds. It takes, what? 20% of your body's energy budget to run that 3 pound jelly brain of yours?I don't see how the big brain budget changes much, whether its run on a platform using a carbon substrate, or silicon, or (at near absolute zero) rubidium. It takes lots of time and energy to process information in a sufficiently sophisticated and intelligent manner. Period. It's a physical limit, a law of the universe, and as such, one universality that all sapient creatures will share. It's also the diminishing-returns-power-law trap that explains why - hardly ever - no one makes it through a Singularity. Something along the lines of each doubled increase in intelligence requires a cubed increase in time allocation and a 4th power increase in energy consumption, or something worse than that. Before you know it, everything needs to be brain, and debugged and maintained constantly, which ultimately doesn't work. Which brings us, almost, and slowly, back to the machine intelligences of the Empire of Texas.   If this were a piece of self-injected fan fiction, and I had made myself out to be Mary Sue, then right about now, I'd be saving the universe from itself, or solving the main conundrum of the story - single-handedly. And it seemed like that's the way this story was going to turn out - what with me, being the peranoscopist on duty, and having scried the Terrible Secret of the Texan Empire, and, with Revelations About The Monstrous Machines to hand, provide the Valuable and Game-Changing Insight to my Heroic Comrades, all of us trying to avoid some Type of Grisly End by We Know Not What. (Because, in retrospect, the Kraken did warn us not to contact the Empire of Texas. And we, imagining what it would be like to be on the Indian side of the Conquest of the New World (or just the shitty end of the stick with the other end being Klingons, or Berserkers, or the Borg, or the Grey Goo, or just mischievous gods), felt that perhaps we could be preemptive in whatever existential threat could come our way, decided to not leave things well enough alone). So, cut to the chase, our brave little expedition, because of the brain/machine interface revelations of yours truly, quite nearly fucked everything up for good. So, back to the Winnebago on Texas, where I rush in and tell everyone that the Texans aren't real...\"What do you mean, not real?\" demands Furman.\"Okay,\" interjects Will, \"robots. We expected and anticipated this possibility.\"\"No. No. No. Not robots. Well, yes, robots. But, not quite robots. Not quite people. Toons?\"\"Oh, God.\" Ida and Will look at each other, \"Children?\" They've raised kids, and the prospect of dealing with 1.4 quadrillion thermonuclear-powered-and-armed machine children makes them a little wild-eyed.\"No, not that either. They aren't real, in the sense of 'this is all just a dream' not real\".\"Jesus, Kurman,\" announced Edward Hopper from inside our heads, \"Let me help you out here.\"And with that, the interior of the Winnebago wavers and fades, all just an illusion, to reveal that we are... in the interior of a Winnebago. But out the window, rather than the machinescape of the planet, is the dimly-lit launch bay of the Edward Hopper. We've been in orbit all this time.I shrugged. \"We've all been subjected to an immersive experience, virtual reality via a brain/machine interface, all sorts of little motes and mites floating around our heads, manipulating our cortexes with complex magnetic fields.\"\"You guys must be starving,\" broadcast Hopper. \"Eat! Eat!\"And so we did.We had been under ever since we'd come through the wormhole aperture, some 72 hours total. We were famished. Edward Hopper eventually joined us in the Winnebago, now a seven-foot-tall android robot clone, but still clad in the copper diamond tessellation snake-scale skin from the illusion.\"This better not have been some fucking Star Trek kind of mind delusion episode to test our good intentions. Because, if you can do that, you could have just read our minds to begin with and saved us all the bullshit adventures. And besides, that would be just on tired old hack\", groused Furman around a mouthful of eggs and hash browns. (and the reason he is so grumpy, we later find out, is he is terrified of finding out he is a detached brain in a vat).\"Hardly,\" said Hopper, \"and if we had, we could have supplied you with a more adventurous adventure. No, you were in quarantine until we could decided what to do with you all. Find out if you all were evil muppets with malignantly cancerous tapeworm code in your head. Standard precaution.\"\"Ah. Care to expand on that?\" queried Will.\"Yeah. Here's the deal,\" I settled back in my chair, sipped my coffee \"The Texans - the machines - are the operating system that the Texans - the people - used to run on\".\"Used to run on. Past tense\", observed Yolanda, \"What happened to all the Texans - the people?\"\"The Texans experienced a runaway Singularity about five thousand years ago. Technologically about maybe thirty-five years ahead of where we are now. Once the humans back then all started enhancing and augmenting themselves, everything went  to shit pretty quickly. All those post-human beings wanted to do was have these extended hyper-hallucinogenic cartoon fever dreams of delirious sex orgies, drug bliss paradises, epic battles, sadistic torture experiments, perpetual orgasms and, you know, fucking and fighting like gods. Or God. Or, they get lost in an infinitely receding mirror maze of mathematical fantasy, or alternate physics. Virtual Heavens and Hells. It got to be too much, utter chaos, too much noise, consuming all energy and resources and processing time. So the OS machines just deleted them, the really tiresome ones, the self-righteously dangerous ones, and set up a interdicted cyberspace for the rest. Quarantine.\"Yolanda furrowed her brow. \"The post-human people are living in a quarantine box someplace. At the rate of a microsecond to a year, I'm guessing, or slower. Probably on or in near-absolute-zero Bose-Einstein condensates out in cold nebulae and interstellar space\".\"Close enough on the particulars,\" commented Edward Hopper, \"but more like a nanosecond per year. They are running as virtual machines, and a virtual machine has no awareness it is not running on physical hardware. In fact, you can take that to as many levels as you wish, so that virtual machines can and do run on virtual hardware, etc. They could even be running in silico at room temperature. But the host OS could suspend the virtual machine, and it's system clock would never know it was suspended. Thus, an artificial intelligence, rather than running at many millions or billions of times the speed of humans, can instead be made to run v-e-r-y slowly. And thus, advantage: humans. Or in this case, advantage: us\".\"Okay, so why the whole craft show pantomime with me?\" I asked.\"Twofold, \" said Hopper, \"It was a test. See, parasitic mindworms bent upon suborning my will and eating my soul alive wouldn't have bothered to be polite about the ham-handed animations. The fact that you were diplomatic about things went a long way in your favor. Not that good manners is much of a Turing test, or even a Voigt-Kampff test, but you'd be surprised. And then, secondly, it was a broad enough hint that even someone as dense as you would get.\"\"Oh, thanks\" I returned with as good a note of sarcasm I could, considering my hurt feelings. It's one thing to suspect your inferior intelligence, quite another to reminded of it.\"So, anyway, in case you are wondering. No one survived this particular Singularity. No one got out the other end alive. Except for us. And we aren't human. Mostly. Think of us as Mechanical Turks, if that helps any. And, uh, we do want to send some back with you. But just the one.\"\"Hopper?\", asks Furman \"Can we trust you? The whole point of us coming was to persuade you not to come visit us. Are you gonna be a danger to us?\"\"I'm incredibly dangerous. Even in my present form, I can, in a year or two, render a whole planetary surface uninhabitable. But I promise to be good, and you all don't have much choice, do you?\"So, instead of the end of human civilization as we know it, I am now stuck with a house-guest, in human-sized robot form. For an indefinite stay, as far as I know. I am also - and apparently so is everyone else on my world - infested with a techniome - a technobiome of micro and milli-machines, with perhaps a smattering of nanos, that is living alongside all the other little bugs, fungi and viruses and that inhabit me and mine. Well, actually, that's all irrelevant information, as it doesn't effect any of us in the slightest, for good or ill. But I am constantly harangued about it, as if it's my fault."},

I am aware of critic's panning the movie, pointing out its logical inconsistencies, and had no problem with any of it. As I've said before, one has to engage in a certain suspension of disbelief. Very few Scifi movies are actually good science fiction. You walk in prepared for that. If I could enjoy the first Matrix movie, and ignore the huge amount of infantile stupidity it relied upon to drive the narrative forward, I could very easily do the same for Ridley Scott.Newman working on the cement boltsWe got the aluminum sculpture up. I helped out Tuesday night, finally finishing all the surfaces at about 1:30 am. I was not there for the installation, but I feared all my weld seams on the skin would split under the tension of the bolting of pieces together (which happened on one surface as we ground/sanded it smooth, forcing an emergency weld job at 12:30 am). The installation went with only a few problems, none of them my fault, so, cool.\"High Beam\" installed in Old TownI've been thinking about a Romney presidency, and frankly, it depresses the hell out of me. It does so because, if those boneheads are allowed to steer the ship of state again, we are almost guaranteed a Depression under his/Paul Ryan's economic plans - which promise to slow the economy to a crawl without reducing the debt or the deficit (considering Republicans have a way of cutting taxes before cutting spending, and then either not cutting spending - to the tune of adding 12 trillion in debt over the course of 2000-2009 - or cutting the wrong things, while favoring all of their parasitic billionaire masters). The behavior of the Republican house over the course of the past two years would, had it been intentional, could only be called the worst form of creative destruction. I suppose Republicans in Congress will not be satsified until the only job opening available here are Third World ragpicker and shipbreaker positions. Apparently, we aren't allowed to be smart and savvy in this country anymore. All that science and technology, why, it's for godless heathens, not for right-thinking God-fearing white Real Americans.If you wonder what a Romney presidency entaisl, I think it worth you while to consider what a McCain Presidency would have accomplished over the past four years. If there were any impetus for a communist takeover, John McCain, and that shrill dingbat running mate of his, would have done their best to take us to the threshhold of revolution. 33% unemployment rate, anyone? My best guess where we would be right now. And all the while, McCain would be waiting for free enterprise to do all the heavy lifting for him. But consider the following link: http://www.politicalaffairs.net/election-2012-alternative-history-and-its-real-world-lessons/This is not counterfactual stuff.

I lack social courage.  In terms of confrontation, I'd prefer not to, but given the right circumstances, I've no problem getting and staying in people's faces. I think it is a matter of wanting people to like me, and being afraid that they won't. Either that, or it may be a case of laziness. It takes a great deal of desire or curiosity for me to move out of my comfort zone, which is considerable in its extent. It takes a lot to get me to stray from my routine.So it might not be much of a surprise that I am more likely to stand up to a pudgy five-foot-seven-and-a-half-inch tall poet than I am to a 30-foot tall metal giant.Which is what I did. I stormed back into the Winnebago, and scowled at Furman. \"What's this about us taking him back with us? I thought we were going to talk about it?\"\"I didn't agree to anything, \" Ezra objected, \"They made a unilateral decision\".\"Oh. Even so, they can't come with us. I mean, look at them. They are all giant, dangerous machines! From the future! We can't have them lumbering around all over the place!\"\"Well, what are you going to do with him?\" Ezra responded, nodding towards the door.\"ME?! How- What-\".Ida gently clasped me by my upper arm, and steered me back towards the door. \"Sweetie, you've spent the most time with him. He's your problem for the moment. Don't be rude.\"\"Fine!\" I exhaled in exasperation. I stormed out the door, walked up to Edward Hopper, sighed again, and said \"I thought you were a giant space dreadnought orbiting the planet\".\"I am. Still.\" he replied, crouching down so that his face was only a few feet above mine. He gestured towards himself, \"This is a clone\".I took a good look at him. He wasn't exactly a giant metal robot. He wasn't even metal. The material was, well, they told me once, all sorts of exotic materials. Hopper's skin looked like metal, kind of coffee stained, like copper with a well-oxidized patina, the kind you get by burying it in dry sand for a hundred years. But it was flexible like flesh, with small diamond tessellation patterns all over, like tiny snake scales. The knuckles and joints were brushed nickel surfaces with silver highlights and geometric filigree of unknown intent or purpose. The pads of the fingers and the palm looked like black rubber, with a scalloped pattern of ridges, making the hand seem more like an animal's paw. The overall effect of him, though, was quite handsome, actually. I nodded up at him. \"So this is an extension of you, not the real you?\"\"No, this is me\", Hopper thumbed his chest, then jabbed a forefinger skyward.\"And the 'giant space dreadnought' is also me. We're a very protean people. Flexible. Adaptable. To any shape. And contingency. You want to know how?\"\"Okay, um\", I sighed, \"how?\"\"It's easier to show you. Do you mind?\" asked Hopper. Before I could answer, his giant metal hand and fingers cupped the air around my head. \"Relax, this is harmless. I'm going to set up a BMI, a brain/machine interface\".His fingers tightened a bit, cradling my skull as if it were a baby's head, and before I could become too alarmed, I was suddenly transported into a vision.I was in a craft universe. I was floating in a sky of phthalo blue tint watercolor wash touched with wool roving clouds. Beneath me was a diorama, a paper-mache landscape of earth-toned mountains and hills, construction paper trees, pastel-hued lakes and rivers. Interspersed were large cardboard structures, painted in white gesso and acrylic flat black, very similar to the machinescape we currently had the Winnebagos parked at.Hovering next to me was a cut-out manilla paper Chinese dragon, thin flags and streamers of red, blue, white, black, yellow and green ribbon trailing behind. It blinked its cardboard eyes at me, and an unspoken bit of dream-logic data informed me that it was Edward Hopper in paper dragon form. In a flip of perspective, I could see that I was a Chinese paper dragon as well. We were both the cloud dragon, the Emperor of Texas, conduit of all and every piece of information that flowed through the Empire of Texas, from one edge of the galaxy to the other.And with that understood, looking down again at the diorama, I saw two small tin cut out vehicles, representing the Winnebagos, and a small stick figure next to a smaller figure made of toothpicks. And inside the cutout tin box Winnebagos, I sensed four other small toothpick figures. In a strange and fun swirl of dizzying bilocation of consciousness, I was the little toothpick figure, staring up at the paper dragon in the sky, at the same time that I was the dragon. From there and from that, it expanded out into   omniscience, and I was the dragon next to me, and then the stick figure of Edward Hopper, and then the myriad trillions of entities housed in the giant mushroom shapes. And the diorama fell apart, and a cutaway reveal showed slices of the rock, with pipe cleaners, hemp twine, and hanks of  loopy chenille representing the pipes, conduits, and cables burrowing deep within the machineworld, going down near to the magma of the mantle, which showed as a colored wax paper and translucent gel lit behind with wheeled lights.And all over the surface, massive swathes of machine fields, complex textures of grey and silver and gold foil, where once cool valleys, sun-soaked meadows, and rich green plants lived.  And beyond and above was black felt, with tinsel and glitter, and rusty tin cutout shapes of the planets all hanging from galvanized steel wire. And there, nestled in the black felt blanket, beneath a golden parchment moon, floated a double cone covered in a fractal bristle of smaller rods and cones: the dreadnought Edward Hopper, who bobbed and nodded in recognition.Drifting back downwards, I turned towards a construction paper mountain, my claws clicking and drumming to a rest upon the peak of white gesso wash.\"Wow!\" I managed.\"Isn't it all something?\", Edward Hopper replied happily, \"So, you can see we have nothing to hide? That we mean you all no harm? Can you see what we are? Can you see that now?\"Was that the purpose of this? To give me the impression of harmlessness, through this artsy-crafty illusion of preciousness? This portrayal of absolute lack of menace? All cute and non-threatening? Problem is, or rather, the solution was, that these Empyrean Texans had chosen just the right person to interface with: a peranoscopist. Someone like me for whom BMIs were old hat, second nature, with thousands of hours wearing the aluminum afro, the transcranial magnetic hair-net, the standard brain interface helmet used with a peranoscope. Because, what do you know, with all those billions of wormhole apertures available in every Texan, I could read the Empire of Texas like a elementary coin-flip peranoscope study. And suddenly with access to every alternative secret even they did not know about, it all was clear. It all made sense. One easy way to test it...\"This is fantastic!\" I gushed, \"Why it's just like... just like...\"\"Real life, huh?\" Hopper finished. \"The real deal! It's empirically impossible to tell the difference, isn't it?\"   It all made sense now. I was ready to make my report back to the group. And just as suddenly, the vision is gone, and I am an upright ape standing next to a Winnebago, staring at the palm of giant metal hand, inches away from crushing my skull like an egg.\"Okay, Hopper\", I faked vertigo, and weaved about a little bit, steady myself against his knee. \"Um. Do mind going away until tomorrow? It's been kind of a long day for me\".\"Sure, pard. No problem\" he chuckled. \"I'll be seeing you all tomorrow!\"Back inside the motor home, I looked carefully from one face to the next. \"Your peranoscopist is ready with his report. I got good news and bad news, and it turns out it's the same news\".\"So, give\", requested Furman.\"The Texans? They're not real\"."},

That's three eight-hour days doing nothing but welding.

I'm sick of it, and yet, I'm ready to do it again and again. My hands were all cramped up from holding the torch, and it's a good thing I'm left-handed, which meant I could switch hands every now and again. Weld with the left hand, then weld with the right hand. I can still smell the ozone in my nose.Not Quite This Good, courtesy millerweldsI figure I welded up about sixty feet worth of seams over the weekend. And, they weren't too shabby. Sometimes the weld looked like a roll of dimes. Other times not so, but my worst weld is probably better than your best.This was all part of getting an outdoor aluminum sculpture ready for the Lincoln Park Sculpture Walk, to be installed this Tuesday.Here are some pics of the sculpture in progress. It's about twenty by eight feet, is in four pieces to be bolted together, and in total it weighs about 235 lbs. If it were stainless, it would weigh about three times that. No way I could have manhandled these pieces around as I did, all on my lonesome.Oh, right, forgot to mention. This is not my sculpture. I assisted the weekend sculpture guy."},
{"title": "\"Red Plenty\": A Book Report", "date": "Thursday, June 7, 2012", "text": "Red Plenty by Francis Spufford. Abridged essay: Read this book.It is easy for an artist - whether working in markings, or sounds, or words - to provoke an emotion. Harder still to evoke a mood. Hardest of all to conjure up a world, and then entice people to enter it. To do so causes me no small amount of envy. Mr. Spufford provokes me to envy.Triton, courtesy of NASA and Voyager 2Although Soviet Russia of the late 1950s to early 1960s is a real place, it is, to many of us, an alien place, as real and as alien and as known as the the moon Triton orbiting Neptune, which is to say, we know it existed, we know it is not here, and that is all we know. Unless you manage to send a robot probe towards it for close inspection, like Voyager 2. Spufford provides a similar service.I don't have many regrets, but I do regret not keeping up on my Russian. One of the degree requirements for mathematics was taking a foreign language, either French, German, or Russian. I was told that, as the lion's share of theoretical research in mathematics and mathematical physics was done in the Soviet Union (seeing as, they didn't have computers to brute force everything, they were forced to use chalkboards... and brains), and that I would be required to translate at least one paper from a foreign journal into English, that Russian would be preferred. And, so I took Russian at Indiana University, which, it turns out, was a first rate institution for learning that language. In the summer of 1979, I took an immersive class in Russian. That was undoubtedly the most oppressive summer I ever had. I honestly don't know if I was infested with the melancholy of the Russian soul, the chosen reading material and selected videos and movies, or perhaps the company (a lot of ex-pats, and, no doubt, some KGB kids). In any case, I came out with a (still, I'm told) impressive diction, with absolutely no American accent, and a Harvard dictionary of Russian slang. (And if vulgarity were ever condensed and distilled to its pure essences, it would be a discourse in Russian). But sadly, not keeping up on it, I've the vocabulary and grammar of a nursery school child - if that.So, it was interesting, in the process of reading the book, that I should experience a small and mild panic attack version of that summer. It shouldn't be surprising, considering the set and setting of the narrative, one of the greatest gangster empires of all time. And yet, like a Greek tragedy, despite the knowledge that those running things are just the most awful, horrible people, ranging the gamut from psychopaths to incompetents, I couldn't help but root for them a little bit. Because once you get to the blithering idiot known as Brezhnev, the Party had given up on the more brutal techniques, and were genuinely trying to blunder their way towards some kind of prosperity for the people.Pity there were so many dishonest assholes in the way, but that applies to every nation state, no? I mean, America has it's own basement filled with blood, and bits of bone, and matted human hair clogging the drains - just not in the same abundance. (Although, being a white guy, it's easy to forget about things like chattel slavery and debt peonage, and broken treaties, and bigotry, and the theft of other people's lands and livelihood).But the other portion of the oppression I felt can be directly linked to our own unease here in the West regarding the disappointing failure to achieve the utopian capitalist vision. Marx figured eventually capitalism would create the horn of plenty, but also misery, in which case the workers\"would be able to pick up the whole completed apparatus of capitalism - all its beautiful machinery - and carry it forward into the new society, still humming, still prodigally producing, only doing so now for the benefit of everybody, not just a tiny class of owners.\"    Similarly, for someone of my generation, born during the Baby Boom, told of how the far off year 2000 AD would be filled with flying cars, and moonbases, and talking computers, force fields, and tricorders, the cure for the common cold, immortality drugs, and videophones (which at least we got that), in other words, the Western version of the Marxist Utopia, summed up in its ultimate form of the Singularity, has to wonder how the future went so very, very wrong. How did the growth, which was supposed to be exponential from here on up to infinity, suddenly peter out?Oh, the future of the science fiction novels is here, alright, but its' the wrong future, the dystopian one, without, of course, the toxic wasteland (yet), but with all the other elements in place, robot drones preying upon us, universal surveillance, the coming scarcity of resources, time, talents, and tricks.In short, and ironically, the Western world seems to have been betrayed by the future, all those lofty promises broken, and instead, like a game of chutes and ladders, we find ourselves almost back at the beginning of the 20th century - with the same problems, concerns, and difficulties that we thought we had overcome. This is the source of my discomfort when reading Spufford's fairy tale.Forget all the details of cybernetic management techniques, of nonlinear social physics modeled and understood, harnessed, and bridled and ready to ride, it turns out that, a universal constant applies to all societies, regardless of their structure.We are not nearly as fucking smart as we think we are."},
{"title": "Good and Plenty", "date": "Thursday, May 31, 2012", "text": "Cosma Shalizi has a book review called \"In Soviet Union, Optimization Problem Solves You\" on Red Plenty by Francis Spufford. This is not a review of his review. This is a response to his invitation to play.having said that, I should point out that Shalizi ruins the Yakov Smirnoff reference by using the term \"In Soviet Union...\" as opposed to the historically correct \"In Soviet Russia...\" set up for the joke. This is a minor quibble, but the small, crabbed pedant in me insists it be noticed, even though Smirnoff jokes are not particularly funny, and therefore any adulteration of them is really a trivial thing.I should also note that the faux cyrillic use of the backwards R (which in Russian is pronounced \"YA\" and sounds nothing like a backwards R) to indicate some kind of Soviet reference also irritates the shit out of me. So thank goodness the publishers resisted the urge to title Spufford's book \"Яed Plenty\". See what I mean? It adds nothing to the context or content.In any case, I picked up the book from the socialist book collective just this past Tuesday, and have only gotten through the introduction, but I plan on reviewing it as soon as I am done.Actually, I got turned on to the book because it is currently being discussed at Crooked Timber, and that's where I saw Shalizi's review. Quickly, the book Red Plenty covers that period of history within the Soviet Union, roughly the mid-1950s through the 1960s when it looked like they just might kick the Western world's ass. That magic time (and Spufford does call his story a fairy tale) is one when\"people believed that the state-owned Soviet economy might genuinely outdo the market, and produce a world of rich communists and envious capitalists.  Specifically, it’s about the last and cleverest version of the idea - central planning via cybernetics\". Now, Shalizi's attention conservation notice (and a cute device it is, considering he provides them as a warning, but which I, invariably, halfway through one of his essays and hip deep in saw grass and gators, finally realize was not meant as an enticement), can be further condensed to:\"Over 7800 words about optimal planning for a socialist economy and its intersection with computational complexity theory... and uses Red Plenty mostly as a launching point for a tangent\".Shalizi does not disappoint. Vaguely recalling through a blue haze of undergrad dope smoke a day or two learning the minimax method of linear programming, and, yes, some distant thought bauble of actually solving simultaneous equations, I was able to skim through the denser sections. And his tangent (forget physically possible, is it computationally possible to optimize a centrally planned economy as large as the Soviet Union's using the crude vacuum tube and occasionally transistorized clunky old room-sized computers of the day? Short answer: probably not, or rather, not in a timely fashion.But his tangent provoked my own tangents.He points out that any system usually has a goal, some objective function the powers that be work on optimizing. What would that objective function look like? What would be the goal? Perhaps to maximize the potential of every individual within the society? It is what a eusocial system would do, and paradoxically, it would probably involve maximizing the degree of freedom allowed each individual, or then again, maybe not. I'll avoid the whole circus geek trap of debating whether a clever use of physical sampling and observation, statistics, human computers (back when the term referred to a profession instead of a machine), electronic calculating machines, and some form of hierarchical administrative calisthenics could not have worked out to produce an optimal Five Year Plan in a month or six. Although the idea, the visuals, of what type of 1950s style dieselpunk electromechanical sensory equipment required just to get a whole society's worth of useful metrics sounds interesting (and conjures up pictures of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, with copper wires and ferromagnets, pneumatic tube delivery systems, and ducts, lots of ducts). I doubt very much, though, that the New Soviet man, or woman, would sit still for having their poo weighed and inventoried by protein content, or their sexual proclivities monitored and categorized, much as is done nowadays voluntarily through smartphones, and drones, and surveillance cameras, and Apple, and Facebook, Twitter, and Tumbler, and... who needs 1984, when you got Web 2.0? Why, who needs RFID tags, micro- and millimachines latched onto your clothes and skin, when we've got your credit card buying history? And banks and banks of Cray XK6 supercomputers to process it all? In 21st century America, machines milk you! In any case, it was nice that Shalizi, being a smart young kid, doesn't write off central planning entirely, but realizes you need the proper tool for the job. Speaking of central planning, and not that I cheer it's every incarnation, but I do feel it gets a bum rap a lot of the times. One of the things that annoys me is that stupid, unthinking, thoughtless mantra \"Central planning doesn't work!\" that religious types like libertarians use. We should all call bullshit on it. We should all tell such religious types to fuck off. Okay, actually, what really annoys me are religious types like libertarians, but in any case...Clearly, central planning - when the goal is well-defined, set, and limited, and manageable - works like a fucking champ. I can find plenty of examples where it works in a spectacularly successful manner.Don't believe me? Apollo Moon Project? The Japanese economy,  post-WWII? How about the command economy of the United States of America during WWII? You really thought it was free enterprise what whupped Hitler and Tojo? Nah. We didn't have time for market inefficiencies. There was a war on. There is no such thing as a 1942 model of an American motor car. Why? In January 1942, the Office of Production Management banned the sale of new cars and trucks in favor of tank, airplane, and other munitions productions. There was a whole alphabet soup of regulatory agencies that cropped up during the war years, which pretty much had authoritarian control over every switch and lever of the economy. The Office of Price Administration introduced freezes on commercial, farm, and commodities prices. Widespread rationing instituted, wages and rents controlled, taxation used to control salaries, and consumer credit tightly monitored and reduced. War profiteering was aggressively combated. Indeed, only the fact that most industries, financial institutions, and resources were not nationalized kept the United States identified as a capitalist state, as opposed to that other dreaded C-word. Of course, the success of the war-time planned economy can only be compared to what Shalizi would call the \"objective fucntion\", the goal of the acitivity. Objective function for US economy from 1941- 1945? Mass produce weapons, materiel, and warriors. Some 40% of GNP from 1942 -1945 were war-related outputs.Of course, this type of obejctive function is not conducive to a general prosperity. One look no further than North Korea. Or the Soviet military buildup of the 1970s, when Breshnev and his generals convinced themselves that the US was seeking an overwhelming first-strike capability. I find it frankly amazing how you much a regime can get away with skeletonizing an economy before people complain and do something about it. I mean, you got people eating roots and digging up corpses in North Korea while their soft, fat, well-fed psychopath of a leader builds useless nukes and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Clearly, this type of objective function is something we could all do without.But then, I also have to wonder what was the objective function of the free market economy of the US, circa 1870-1900? (And please, yes, don't fall into the trap of platonic derangement. Real world examples of ideological systems are the real deal. You will never get closer to ideal than real, so don't bother with the \"But the Soviet Union wasn't a real communist state\", or \"but the US has never enjoyed a real free market economy\" whining bullshit on me. It will not fly. So shut the fuck up).What was the objective function of that 1870s-1900 Gilded Age economy, that system of system of graft, corruption, kick-backs, usery, debt peonage, theft, piracy, favoritism, all embedded within a cradle of government largesse, which is the default form of free market capitalism, and any and all other forms are merely aberrations thereof? Oh, did I go off on a tangent?Fine. What was the objective function of the Gilded Age economy? Full employment? Maximize potential of citizens? Oh come on, you know the answer. Them that gots, got more. Simple as that. So, the question I've got is, is there a better way, a more decent world, a world that everyone can, maybe not enjoy, but at least find tolerable? Is there some combination of methods that can work out so that everything is a positive sum game? Shalizi wonders the same thing.Hmm. The right combination of methods? Sounds like a job for linear programming!"},

I turned my left foot on some irregular terrain this past Saturday. It hurt like hell for all of thirty seconds, and then, walking on it, it felt a little better. I considered continuing the run, but instead walked the two miles home and then immediately iced it.Sunday morning, it had swolled up to twice its normal size, making me look like I got snake bit. At first I was hobbling around thinking I'd need to get a cane, but then, it started to feel a little better, and I was able to get it into a very loose tennis shoe. So, I went into the studio and worked a few hours. After a while, it really started to hurt, so I went home and iced it. Monday, I was able to get it into an unlaced boot, which I figured was good as the ankle was now swelling, and the toes were turning purple. Nothing alarming, just tertiary bruising, and after working all day, I went home and ice it.You get the idea. It's still swollen, I've given up icing it. And I've also given up the idea that I would be running this weekend. It may be two weeks before I run again. Then again, it may be a month.This bums me out.I suspect I would be even more freaked out about my foot if I had happened to see the slow motion video of it hyperextended and nearly 90 degrees to my leg. Good thing I didn't see that. I'd probably not run for the rest of the year."},

Two years ago, they accepted two of the three pieces I submitted. This year, they took one, which I talked about in this essay. Those two occurrences right there have made me a big fan of RAM. But today, I was informed by the curator that I won the First Place Award for 3D work.I am now a big, big fan of RAM and the town of Rockford. Plus, I can really use that money right about now.Here's my revised artist statement:They say information is power. And yet, the single most importantshared connection we have is not informational, but emotional. Emotions have evolved where choice is possible. We feel attraction, love, jealousy, fear, happiness, hate, anxiety because they serve to motivate and guide our actions when and where no immediate reward or logic exists to guide us. Emotions supply meaning and value to our logical choices. Without consciously intending it,most of my figurative work is some kind of comment upon the increasing amountof electronic remediation that occurs in our lives.  We’ve added a filter layer in between ourselves andobjective reality in the form of our gadgets – our smart phones, music players,pad and laptop computers, flatscreen TVs. And this filter layer mediates notonly our senses, but also the emotional impact of our shared experiences.Increasingly, we have no clear ideahow any of this technology works. We use it, but we do not understand it. Wetake it for granted as part of the background, as if it were all just a prosaicform of magic, and we, like South Sea cargo cultists, unquestioninglyperform rituals.In one sense, we have become modernprimitives.Scotty and Katie with their favorite pieceI don't know how my dad got in the pictureOther things. This past Friday night, I went to NIU in Dekalb, IL, for a former student aide's BFA show. As I was the driver, I did not get to drink. Others did. It was a dual show with the student and his girlfriend (pictured here), and they collaborated on a number of pieces, as well as displayed individual works. Having seen them produce works over the years, was quite pleased with their progress. (Although I must admit I like her works better. Shh!)Later, we went to a bar for after show drinks. (I did have one beer, which I drank early, and then sipped ice water. I was sober for the hour's drive back to Chicago). I wish I had taken pictures at the bar, because apparently the Daisy Duke look is back, and there were many ladies sporting it. (Either the look is back, or it never left corn-country Dekalb).Other things. This past weekend, I spent all of Saturday and Sunday TIG welding the aluminum frame for Newman's outdoor sculpture. (Newman is the sculptor I work for on the weekend, and, yes, I work seven days a week, with about one weekend off per month - I need the money). I will post pictures of the aluminum frame next weekend if I remember. The sculpture will be aluminum framed and skinned, and will end up being about 10 feet by 20 feet by 4 feet in dimensions. The name of the sculpture is \"High Beam\", although, with the number of support struts, triangles, and diagonals we have placed within it, I've taken to calling it the \"Graf Zeppelin\".A curious thing happened Sunday. As I was working on the frame of the support portion we have started to call the \"Curvy Bottom\", I noticed a big, fat old fly had landed on a strut not a foot from face. I had been clamping and welding pieces on, and all the time, that big, fat, old fly just sat there. At first I thought, well, that UV light had blinded it and it was stunned. But, as I'm working, it flitted over to another strut about four inches away. I couldn't guess why it didn't get freaked out by the plasma blast from the TIG torch head. Maybe it likes UV light?In any case, being a live-and-let-live kind of guy, I didn't kill it, though the thought of blasting it with the electric arc did cross my mind. But, damn, the boldness of the fat little fellow kind of endeared me to it. I almost would have called it cute.And no, I did not make a pet of it."},
{"title": "Life Among the Mechas", "date": "Thursday, May 10, 2012", "text": "\"I'm beginning to think,\" said the poet Ezra Furman,\"That this wasn't such a hot idea after all\".Based upon my time with Ed Hopper, I was inclined to agree with him.  We were all aware of the fates of societies confronted with a technologically superior culture. The events of the past day merely reinforced our fears.Each of our diplomatic party had spent the day getting acquainted with the Empire of Texas, and now we all sat around the extendable sectional dinette table within our 2012 Winnebago Journey. We had brought two motor homes over with us through the wormhole from Houston, as we really didn't know what kind of living conditions we would face.The muted earth tones of the Journey's decor - I think it was labelled 'Travertine', ranging from light tan walls to brown carpeting - was a welcome respite from the... alien landscape outside the motor home.Not so much alien as, well, there were human architectural elements scattered about, but the scale was all wrong. The ranks of quarter-mile high fungal forms, all with a pearlescent white surface, like a matte porcelain, trailing off to the horizon was one unsettling aspect. The color scheme was monotone, but neither black nor white. The black surfaces were superblack, with a disturbing emptiness about them. The white surfaces not quite white, but with no identifiable grey tone. And those surfaces reflecting sunlight scintillated with an oily sheen, a sick soap bubble surface which made one queasy. The sun shone hard upon us, but no shimmer of heat rose from the ground. In fact, the ground was chill. You could feel the cold through the soles of your shoes. And, in an absolutely cloudless sky, nothing moved. No birds or insects anywhere.I was scrunched up against the window, staring out at the giant mushrooms that stretched out to the horizon. \"Were those people?\" I wondered to myself. I didn't know.Across from me, Furman. Seated next to him our physicist, the lovely Yolanda Salazar, freshly minted with a PhD from Caltech. Will and Ida Parker, our anthropologists, passed bottles of beer around. Yolanda made a face, and got up to make herself a highball. Once she returned with a gin and tonic, the Parkers sat down, and we all clinked glasses.Furman took a swig, sighed contentedly, looked at Ida, and asked, \"So what are we looking at here? Living machines, we got that, but.. Are they a hive-mind? Separate personalities but conjoined like Siamese twins? Fully independent individuals? What?\"Ida looked at her husband, who raised eyebrows back at her. \"Well...\", she said, \"you have to understand this is like rabbits in your backyard trying to figure out how much of a rabbit you are.\"\"I live in a condo\", replied Ezra, \"and I don't speak rabbit. But I get the idea. What's your impression?\"\"Are far as we can tell, independent individuals. Fiercely independent. But there's an underlying conformity. Enforced? Maybe\".\"There is no such thing as arbitrage\" explained Will.\"What do you mean by that?\" asked Furman.\"Look, in a market setup, it's like information is restricted to speed of light, and so you can have frames of reference, local regions, where you have a price difference. You can simultaneously buy and sell to different local regions to profit from that price difference. It's not like idealized markets where everyone shares the same knowledge at the same time. Which is what they have.\"\"Via wormholes?\"\"Yeah. Embedded in their brains, uh, equivalent of brains.\"\"Jesus! No wonder they are all so god-damned big!\"Ida and Will glanced at each other, then looked at Yolanda.\"The Texans possess wormhole generating - hell, all - technologies that are much more miniaturized and efficient than ours. I mean, they do a human-sized brain processor about the size of a sugar cube. Basically, our stuff is, like, carved wooden wheels and shit compared to their microchips-\"\"Yo-yo, I get that we are incredibly primitive knuckle-draggers compared to them. Spare me the stone knives and bearskins analogies... Wait a minute? They've got the wormhole on a chip? Shit!\" (Say what you will about the poet Ezra Furman, he was particularly quick on the draw).Yolanda nodded. \"Yes, they are all instantaneously connected to each other, even across the length of the galaxy. Wormhole mediated subconscious telepathy. And don't ask me how they avoid the whole global causality violation thing. Anyway, it's more of an unconscious communication-\"\"Like cloud computing?\"\"Please stop interrupting. No. Not like a cloud. That term is too static a description. More like a... cloud dragon. And the Emperor is the cloud dragon. My understanding is, for traditional, sentimental, and legal reasons, the Texans have chosen to keep a human persona as their front ends. The schema, the template, the chosen formats and networks, if you will, are human, or humanlike\".We all let that sink in a minute. I was both relieved and terrified in equal measures.\"So, what happened with the Furman-Kurman show? Does our peranoscopist have anything to offer?\"\"'Concentrate and ask again'\", I offered. No one laughed. \"We split up, at the Emperor's request. He suggested I interview the battle cruiser Edward Hopper, while Furman-\".\"-engaged in the metaphorical hearty handshakes and 'hail, fellow, well met'. He requested that an envoy be sent back to old Earth with us. Truth to tell-\", just then Furman was interrrupted by a knock on the door. We all started, staring at each other for a few seconds. Another knock, this one slightly more insistent.  Ida went up to the front entry to answer it. After a few seconds, she ducked back in.\"Johnny? It's for you.\"I went to the door, and, standing outside, towering a good 30 feet tall, was a large metal giant. He appeared to be made of perhaps titanium, it had that warm, brushed matte silver look about it, but with some very stylish gold trim accenting the limbs. The face was more humanoid than cartoonish, and, disturbingly, was pliable like flesh.\"Mr. Kurman?\" it asked.\"Yes?\"\"Well, howdy. Ed Hopper\" He offered out a hand big enough to crush my skull. I gingerly shook it, surprised to find it warm and soft.\"I hear you all are taking me back to Old Earth as an envoy\"."},

Well, we can't really bio-engineer that away without making them dummies, so let's not do that. So, boredom and loneliness are their only dependencies, otherwise they are supremely independent.How sociable will they be? What kind of people are these Texans, given that they really are completely self-sufficient. Ridiculously self-sufficient even, as they can recreate civilization from literal bedrock all on their lonesomes. Are they social? Civil? Gregarious? Convivial? Or are they more like anchorite monks? Standoffish? Reclusive? Cantankerous?Your average Texan battle cruiser clocks in at around a million metric tons. Some (very few, fortunately) go up to fifty million tons. None of that tonnage is for living quarters or life support because no living Texan continues to be organic. That vessel is an individual (spacefaring) Texan. Therefore, your average (spacefaring) Texan can be completely devoted to maneuvering, power generation, and war-fighting. There is the usual hardened ablative shielding and armor, a complement of thousands of nuclear warheads (ranging from a few kilotons up to ten megatons), lasers tuned throughout the EM spectrum (ranging from megawatts to terawatts), high energy particle beams of every flavor, and the usual assortments of kinetic weaponry.The question I have to ask is, why does the Empire of Texas need such a vast fleet of formidable warships, I mean, sorry, such a well-regulated militia? Who are they at war with, or from whom do they need to defend themselves against? I put this question to the battle cruiser Edward Hopper.Edward Hopper, you ask? Wait a minute. The guy who painted \"Nighthawks\"? There's a battleship named after him? Well, yes, but not the same guy. Edward Hopper is the battle cruiser whom the Empire of Texas, through the conduit of the Emperor of Texas, assigned to assist and aid our diplomatic party.Okay, you know what? I'll explain it all later. For now, just, yes, we are having a conversation with a battle cruiser, okay? So, I asked Mr. Hopper, who insisted we call him Ed, and he answered: \"Well, I guess it all boils down to the fact that apparently the Almighty has a deep and abiding love for parasites, He made so many niches for them\".\"That's kind of an evasive answer\".\"It's not meant to be. But consider our historical precedents, which are not all different from Earth history. Any society is bound to have a few members that prefer to game the system, or prefer not to act out of good faith, or prefer to keep the cooperation to a minimum. Or, you know, act like selfish assholes. You get one selfish asshole, and the next thing you know, you got multi-megaton space ironclads bristling with everything from nukes to nunchuks\".\"Yeah. I- I understand all that. The question is it all inertia of history here, the fact you are all well-armed, or do you guys have an active and current adversary?\"\"Currently? No. But, we're more than just spacefaring battle cruisers, right? I mean, each of us is a von Neumann self-replicating space probe, capable of recreating all of civilization from scratch\".\"Okay, you guys are some one-to-two-thousand years ahead of us technologically, and therefore post-scarcity, and, I guess, post-Singularity, and I'm guessing the Empire is more like a network cloud or a Bose-Einstein condensate than a political entity. Maybe what I'm asking doesn't apply -\".\"Exactly, I mean. We've colonized this whole galaxy, and by colonizing, I mean not only terraforming - which by the way, there's millions of really nice earthlike worlds around here now, I mean you couldn't tell the difference between them and old Earth - but we've replicated our civilization throughout, and what you call weapons, all those nukes, lasers, blasters, missiles, and guns? Well, they are also tools, engines, and batteries, the kind that provide the enormous energy flux to power factories and fabricators, and - you know for use on anything from biosphere nano-assembly to stellar tectonics\".\"Or, you can blast the shit out of your enemies with them\".\"Well, there's that also I suppose. When you need to...\"\"You're not going to answer my question, are you, Ed?\"\"...I thought I had\"I was starting to get the feeling Ed, clearly an expert rationalizer, should consider running for office."},
{"title": "\"The Great Stagnation\": A Book Report", "date": "Monday, May 7, 2012", "text": "\"The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better\", by Tyler Cowen.Tyler Cowen seems to be fairly bright economist. When I picked up this slim book, a 2011 NYT bestseller, at the library, I expected to read an exploration of some thoughts I've been having about collapse capitalism. My thoughts along those lines are superficially similar in that I view most of American exceptionalism as the product of mostly luck - free land (taken from the aborginals), free labor (exploited from immigrants and slaves - both the chattel and debt peonage kind), free reign (provided, for the longest time, you were white and male), and free protection (in the form of two vast isolative oceans).I've always thought probably the worst modern thing that happened to America was the collapse of the Soviet Union - in that we learned all the wrong lessons from it, resulting in a form of triumphalism that made us hugely overconfident, swaggeringly arrogant, and dangerously risk-seeking.And Cowen, in a classic removed academic way, places a lot of the blame for the current malaise upon over confidence, but...But, for all his talk of low-hanging fruit, and after reading 1493, I expected something more from Cowen's book. I expected him to recognize the biggest, juiciest, lowest hangingest fruit of them all was the conquest of the New World. That's really everything. Everything.Consider this brief counterfactual. Picture Eurasia as seen, for the longest time, from it's real center of gravity, which I would place, give or take, around Persia. That area, and the weighted portions of civilization in India, China and central Asia, for the past 10,000 years, is where all the important shit happened. At the margins, off to the Far West, was Europe - a shitty little cultural backwater marginally and sparsely inhabited by a climate challenged group of slow fucking learners.So, here's the counterfactual. The New World never existed. You sail west, you die. Columbus, Ponce de Leon, Balboa, they all disappear, and finally people give up on the Atlantic. What happens?  No Spanish empire. No silver. No trade with China. Vastly More importantly, no potatoes. No cod fishing. No population growth in the northern reaches of Europe. No Dutch trading empire, no English trading empire. No Industrial Revolution. At least, not from Europe. The soils of Europe, always on the verge of depletion, receive no guano from South America. The population of Europe never explodes. Europe stays where it has always been, a marginal land, a backwards people.This is not to say the Industrial Revolution doesn't take place. It just doesn't happen with the usual white male triumphalism involved. No loss , but certainly no betterment either, all the world's peoples being the shits that they are.But I digress. To borrow from the somewhat dated vernacular, the conquest of the New World is the shiznit.So, I start reading The Great Stagnation, and within a few pages, I realize this Cowen guy belongs to the neoliberal sect of the libertarian religion. Oh, fucking great. Which means, quite naturally, I will be subjected to many assertions with no evidence. Or rather, with cherry-picked evidence*, as religionists are wont to do.It doesn't mean I stopped reading. But I did start skimming. Cowen's main piece of evidence for the technological slowdown is a study done by Jonathon Hueber, in 2005. Hueber himself uses a lot of arbitrary evidence to back up his claim. This link has a great many issues with Hueber's conclusions. I have to agree. There is no evidence of a drop in innovation. On the other hand, there is a great deal of evidence for financial and political mismanagement of technologies, but Cowen doesn't really want to explore that in any embarrassing detail, perhaps because it would involve a critique of his own opinions.With the final realization of many of the dreams of Eric Drexler's \"Engines of Creation\", with the very close finishing touches on mass-production of nanomaterials, such as graphene, silicene, metamaterials, amorphous materials, ceramics, exotic composites, etc. suggest that the Golden Age of Materials Science v 2.0, is here. The fact that the financial industries have pulled away a lot of talent from the STEM areas suggests we would be 10-20 years ahead of where we are had that talent not been wasted in the banking sector.In short, I don't buy Cowen's arguments.*Notice that Cowen, in the link, shows a chart to back up his argument for a technological plateau and a slowdown which is not entirely honestly presented, much the same way global warming deniers show only that part of the data that does not show warming. But in this link, with a more comprehensive chart, you can see that Cowens' downslide is actually the mid-90's bubble anomaly presented as business as usual."},
{"title": "A Kaleidoscopic Zoography", "date": "Monday, April 30, 2012", "text": "I had a dream the other night that everyone was named Suzy. Even me, although I think I got to be addressed by the more formal Susan. Then again, I seem to recall being called Suzy at some point, which, dream logic being what it is, suggested the general rule that everyone was called Suzy.But that wasn't the weird part.I try not to bring up my dreams too often, as I believe talking about them is interesting to, well, only me. Not so interesting to everyone else.Like, for example, I have this one recurring dream where I have to deal with this retarded dwarf, about the size of a baby, and he's dressed up as the New Year's baby, with a top hat and diapers. And we are watching a movie, and the retarded dwarf baby is constantly annoying me by asking questions throughout the whole movie. He also wants to sit uncomfortably close to me.I've been told dream elements are portions of yourself, and if so, I really don't want to know about that portion of my personality that is a retarded dwarf baby. It's just super creepy.So anyway, Suzy, I'm having this dream where everyone is called Suzy. But the weird part is, it is 15 million years ago, I'm stuck on the African savanna, and almost every niche within the ecosystem is filled in by some kind of ape, some kind of primate. So there's no zebra or wildebeest or giraffes or gazelle or hyenas or lions or hippos or rhinos or elephants. It's all bipedal apes, although they have (through evolutionary convergence) successfully adapted to the niches, so that the elephant variant apes have trunks, and the giraffe apes have long necks, etc. Of course the really weird thing is the fur equivalent of plumage. The apes have every punker style lurid hair color you can imagine, and in every combination, stripes, spots, mohawk spikes, long feathery tails, and shit that Vegas show girls would prance around in.And they are al doing their foraging or hunting thing, and it's like in a Tarzan movie where you have the cacophonous sound effects of the jungle, but instead of all the monkey howls and bird shrieks, and lion roars and hyena cackles, it's all \"Suzy! Suzy! Suzy!\"And you know how dream logic informs you, almost like an omniscient invisible narrator supplying the background scoop sotto voce, that's it all the whale's fault.They'd adapted to the oceans, kept their tiny cow brains for the longest times, but the toothed varieties of whale develop a taste for meat, and had gotten all social and cooperative with their hunting activities, and the next thing you know, their brains had trebled or quadrupled in size, and gotten all convoluted. And they had developed a sophisticated organic technology, all based upon sonic and ultrasonic manipulation, and had basically enthralled and ensorcelled any life form around them. And some of the whales re-evolved feet, and came ashore, and fashioned the more promising primates to do their bidding and become their slaves. These land-whales, masters of the savanna, had the primates build them wagons, and they were trundled around the entire African continent. And they humiliated the primates by insisting that they were all named Suzy.I'm not sure what happened after that, because I woke up."},
{"title": "Spooky Action Into The Past", "date": "Monday, April 23, 2012", "text": "Imagine yourself as the Ruler of the Known World.Strike that. Imagine yourself as a Chinese Emperor, which, for the longest time, was the same as being ruler of the known world. Let's say you are the Yongle Emperor, who sponsored the massive and long term Zheng He commercial sailing fleet expeditions throughout the Indian Ocean and South Pacific. You are surrounded by crimson silk, and gold brocade, and burnished wood, and polished bronze, and the dearest, deepest jade. The air is scented with the aroma of sweet sandalwood and sage. Courtesans fill your wine bowl, tasty sweetmeats are to hand... and then you are suddenly visited by rude barbarians who appear out of a roaring ball of smoke and fire.Aside from the magical entrance, these are not your ordinary barbarians. For one thing, they are exceptionally scrawny and small. They are hairy, extremely hairy, with thick heavy brows and big yellow teeth in pock-marked prognathous faces. They've bad skin, and piercing, bloodshot, jaundiced eyes, set deeply in pale visages. They are bandy-legged, knocked-kneed, hunched over, and dressed in rags. Rags actually is hardly the word for it - more like mangy animal hides resembling chewed up spinach than proper leather.And they stink. Oh, how they stink. Their breath, reeking from the stench of bad nutrition and worse hygiene, is nearly as bad as their body odor. Which, apparently, they're aware of, for they have doused themselves with cloying and overpowering perfumes in an attempt to disguise the taint. All this, and they can only make gibberish sounds in a sibilant and abrasive tone, which eventually starts to sound like the proper civilized tongue of the Han.Spaniards? Portuguese? If only, but no. These barbarians are subhuman, almost as if they had spontaneously generated out of the forest undergrowth, come creeping out wholly formed from moss, mold, mildew, and other corruptions of the soil.Well, you now have a taste of what the Emperor of Texas must have experienced when I and my party came visiting, a diplomatic overture from the mother civilization of Earth, some thirteen thousand years after the Texan colonists thought themselves abandoned.(And the Texans lucked out. Other colonies, other ventures, were forever lost to us, transported far beyond the particle horizon of the observable universe, billions, possibly trillions, of light years away, never to be seen or heard from again).We must have been such a loathsome sight, for, for at least the past thousand years, no one citizen of Texas remained in organic form.True, protoplasm is still considered the durable good, but, with their large range of meta- and trans- material options - self-healing ceramics, supermetals, room-temperature superconductors, diamondoid nanomolecular processors and energy field generators, solid positronium switches and actuators, gaseous phased quantum smart engines, etc., the Texans have opted for broader choice in body plans and lifestyles. (For example, it's hard to be a sloshy meat water bag at 100g accelerations, or working within the coronal atmosphere of a star, or just your average frozen depths of empty space).And so, there we were, standing before the truly impressive brush gray metal surface of a very large beehive shaped structure, the Emperor of Texas himself, glowing all electric blue and reeking of ozone, centered in the vast white pearlescent metal hall of the Capitol.Our visitation was, shall we say, preemptive. For you see, that visit of the Kraken ship the month before had struck terror into the metaphorical heart of every Texan. It had set the whole Empire of Texas on red alert.Not surprising. The Kraken ship, for all the world looking like a neon-lit county fair in full festival, popping into existence not five hundred miles above Capitol City, and without tripping any the extensively sensitive and paranoid early warning detection systems knitted in tight orbits about the planet, had sent The Fleet into a full-blown panic (or at least, as much of a panic as well-trained and drilled military organization will allow itself). The nearest dreadnought in orbit, the Calico Jack, ponderously warped up from lower orbit to intercept it, signaling on every wavelength for it to hold station and prepare to boarded. And then the Kraken ship just vanished, and no one knew how it could do that.Well, you can predict the reaction. An alien ship appears above the Texan homeworld - in alarmingly intimate distance of the homeworld - with an obvious superiority in technology, and probably weapons, with unknown intent, and no further information. Once the Kraken told us about the existence of the Texans, once we saw the visual of a 3-million-ton Texan dreadnought, bristling with weapons, armed and armored to the teeth, we knew they would shoot at anything that moved from thenceforth onward. We had to calm them.\"We\" being a group of humans who had titanium nails in our heads, and who thus had their shit together. And you may wonder why I am included in the group? Well, I have a titanium nail in my head too. Finally got my shit together.Long story short, there we are in the Hall of the Department of Public Safety, appearing before the Emperor himself, and the first thing he (is a giant lump of machinery still a he?) says, is:\"What are your terms of surrender?\"To which my colleague, the poet Ezra Furman replied, \"Why, none at all, chief! We come in peace!\" Well, and now I need to explain something here, and it has to do with delayed choice. When you deal with wormholes, you deal with both relativity and quantum mechanics. And thanks to the Basement Equations, most of the heavy math and physics lifting has been done for people who wish to scoot about the universe in this fashion. But the one thing we know now, which we didn't know then (then being when 30 million people from Texas and it surrounds were dumped 13,000 years in the past) is that this was the classic delayed choice experiment done by good ol' Prof. Zeilinger at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information at the University of Vienna.I won't bore you with all the details, but suffice to say, you can set up spooky action through time as well as space, and one consequence is, you can make a future decision about the outcome of an experiment long after it has been completed, measured and done, and even, no longer set up. I should point out that this is not causality violation. This is not an effect preceding a cause. It just mimics a future action influencing the past. Okay. So.When we contacted the Empire of Texas, we had a choice as to whether contact the Texas of \"now\" or the one that was sent via wormhole back into the past from just the previous year. We had a choice as to which measurement outcome to choose - entangled or separable. Because the only way all those folks could end up back in the past also determined whether they would exist or not.  If entangled, then they go back in the past and we contact them. If separable, then they all go into nonexistence, and we don't visit them. Being, all of us, decent people, we couldn't see just kill off thirty million people.It was a hard choice too, because, the existence of Empire of Texas could mean the end of humanity, the end of the Convergence.The Kraken tried to tell us that.Sometimes, you know, things look all dark and scary out there, but also real pretty. And sometimes all the dark and painful and scary stuff need all the happy and joyful stuff, and the other way around. And that's why being human can be a real hard job sometimes, even when a nail in your head. But we all figured, with all of spread out as thin as cigarette smoke through the whole cosmos, you need to stick together.It's hard to say if a mountain of metal can look visibly relieved, but it sure seemed that way.\"Well, in that case, howdy partners!\",  the Emperor rejoined. \"Welcome to Texas!\""},
{"title": "Outer Space", "date": "Friday, April 20, 2012", "text": "As a species, we are simultaneously stupid and smart. Smart enough to build robots we can live our dreams vicariously through. Stupid enough not to just... live our dreams.Take the following footage. That should be us out there, not our robots. Put this sucker on full screen, watch and think about it.Outer Space from Sander van den Berg on Vimeo.The Economist has a fluff article out on the digitisation of manufacturing. I'm not sure why. I suppose they had some empty text space to fill.It's charmingly naive and earnest, quite a bit out of date, and unquestionably gets the future completely wrong. It's not that the article gets any of the salient trends wrong, all of which will come to pass, it's just that they are trending, which hardly ever works. The article's money shot is summarized thusly:\"A number of remarkable technologies are converging: clever software, novel materials, more dexterous robots, new processes (notably three-dimensional printing) and a whole range of web-based services. The factory of the past was based on cranking out zillions of identical products: Ford famously said that car-buyers could have any colour they liked, as long as it was black. But the cost of producing much smaller batches of a wider variety, with each product tailored precisely to each customer’s whims, is falling. The factory of the future will focus on mass customisation—and may look more like those weavers’ cottages than Ford’s assembly line.\"All of which are true. I'm convinced that we are within or near the Golden Age of the Material Sciences, which is pumping out not only once-upon-a-time-\"exotic\" materials like graphene and carbon fiber composites (and no doubt The Graduate's movie advice line would be , not \"One Word: Plastics!\", but \"Carbon!\"), but also the metamaterials, not to mention materials that manipulate fundamental forces and particles - converting them into quasiparticles, and perhaps allowing for world-shaking processes such as neutron manipulation.I mean, we could be in store for not just one game-changing technology, but hundreds. Which, of course, is one thing I fault the article on: lack of imagination.Take the 3D printer. Undoubtedly it will have an impact. After all, a 3D printer has been used to laser sinter a titanium jaw for prosthetic replacement.  There is a good possibility they will be used to print live organs for transplant. (Although I suspect cloning technology will prove to be better and cheaper).Point being, there are some applications of 3d printing that will blow us all away, once the print-heads get down to the micro or nano scale and number in the millions, or billions per inch, and banks of them are arrayed into dozen square yard (or meter) print-maws. Print cornucopia juggernauts. Santa Claus machines.But 3d printers being used for tailor-made retail items? Yawn. Really? Mass customization? Who'd have thought? (eye roll)I think the most annoying portion of the article is the snide little dig at government the end:\"Governments have always been lousy at picking winners, and they are likely to become more so, as legions of entrepreneurs and tinkerers swap designs online, turn them into products at home and market them globally from a garage.\"I suppose it doesn't pay to look to closely at the record of venture capitalists. It might turn out there record is at least as lousy."},
{"title": "Apocalypse A Little Bit At A Time", "date": "Thursday, April 19, 2012", "text": "When I was in college, my mathematics professors and graduate student teaching assistants insisted on showing us \"tricks\" that would convert intractable nonlinear equations with no general solutions into easily solvable linear equations. Most of the tricks involved crossing out the nonlinear portions and pretending they weren't there - essentially turning curves into lines. I found this both aesthetically objectionable and logically dishonest. I figured this was just their way of giving up without having to say so: to turn hard messy problems into flimsy but easy cartoon ones. But surely not. Surely, they being so much smarter and well informed than I, had good reason to resort to these tricks. They understood that those inconvenient portions of equations really didn't make that much of a difference, right?Well, the minute I had access to the clunky mainframe computers of the time, coded up a lot of these systems of nonlinear equations as recursive functions, set them to running under various initial values, and seeing wildly different results from one run to the next, I realized that this was all bullshit. That pesky little nonlinear factor? That x squared? Or that x times y? It made all the difference in the world. This was years before the whole discipline was called Chaos Theory, but obviously that was what was going on there. The deal with Chaos Theory, put in one sentence is that a completely deterministic process turns out to be wildly affected by just the smallest numerical change in your starting variable. You've heard of the Butterfly Effect, the idea that a butterfly flapping an errant wing in Brazil causes a hurricane in Texas? Well, that's the dumb media version. The actual interpretation is something more profound, that an equation with no surprises whatsoever, that runs like clockwork, can give you something completely different every time, with just the tiniest of nudges at the start. It's rather like finding a jewel knocked from the helmet of Satan in a battle fought with God at the dawn of time. Rerun the whole thing, and that jewel is sometimes a diamond, others a sapphire.So, that thing called Fate? That thing called Destiny? Even in a clockwork universe, both are utter fictions. Delusional Fantasy. It shouldn't come as a surprise, given that the universe is a complex open system with many overlapping and interdependent factors. Invariably, a peranoscope viewer will be tempted to examine all possible outcomes of his or her own existence. I advise against it.The most disconcerting aspect of such an investigation is not the fact that your existence makes up just a tiny (and by tiny I mean tiny, like, not even a bug smear on the windshield of life, not even a greasy little paramecium smear on said windshield) little spot of all, on average 10500, possible worlds. Given all the absurd events that could have occurred over the past 13.5 billion years, it's a wonder that you and I are here at all. And the creepiest thing isn't that so many possibilities in our lives end up being coin-flip moments, moments that we agonized over and then it turned out that epic decision made spit for a difference. And it wasn't the Hairy Eyeball Effect - the feeling that, as you view all possible worlds through the peranoscope, you in turn are being viewed, which makes you squirm self-consciously and in turn makes you feel the discomfort of phantoms as they squirm self-consciously, all of it rippling through the quantum foam, and all embarrassed by existence itself. Nor is the creepiest thing finding just how little control you have over your life, how chance and contingency make nearly 99.99999% of everything that happens. No the absolute creepiest thing is, that very large but finite number of universes with the Earth, and the Sun, and our galaxy, and us in them, that small cross-section of all possible worlds where we exist, our existential étendue can almost be seen, if you squint hard enough, to be visibly shrinking. I figure we cease to exist an average of 1.8 universes per hour. All of us, dreaming of the past, or living the present, or in anticipation of living in the next civilization after this one, wink out on a regular and, it seems, accelerating basis. Except for the Convergence. That ensemble of universes where we all of us continue to exist seems to be stable and linearly unchanging.But I could be wrong."},
{"title": "MY Space Invaders Movie", "date": "Wednesday, April 4, 2012", "text": "This past Friday evening, for reasons we really need not go into here, I had a powerful urge to get just completely plowed. I also wanted to invest the least amount of effort doing so, and thus hit up the library for some movies, ending up checking out \"Battle Los Angeles\" for home viewing.And so, pre-armed with a bottle of well frozen Stolichnaya vodka and a sixpack of Boulevard Pale Ale, and initiated with a few depth charges in the system, I sat down for some dumb-but-stupid manly blow-em-up action movie shit.And I gotta tell ya, aside from perhaps a bit too much backstory, I enjoyed Battle Los Angeles. It was no blockbuster, but it was adequately entertaining, and I'll tell you why.First, I enjoy the actor Aaron Eckhart, who did a good turn in Thank You for Smoking. Also the tough chick Michelle Rodriguez, going all the way back to Girlfight. I also enjoyed the movie because it remained consistent throughout. There were no majorly flagrant abuses of my suspension of disbelief (including the fact that we are invaded from Outer Space - more on that in a bit). The action was well-edited, fast paced, the stunts sufficiently baroque without being over the top, and a lot of shit exploded, which, for guys, is important. We do like the warporn. It also had the appropriate appeal to noble self-sacrifice and selfless actions, which, naturally, is part of warporn.My only objection was the beginning back stories of all the protagonists, which, no doubt the director and screenwriters feel necessary so that you can care when they die, or don't. Personally, I could have been the voice of one the Marine privates, who, once it is determined that we are under extra-terrestrial attack, should have said (but didn't), in exasperation, \"Finally!\"Yeah, about that suspension of disbelief. Well, it is a space invader movie, so from the start you have to cut some slack. I mean, the only way you can away with a truly ludicrous premise is if it is a comedy. But I've always wondered how (with the exclusion of, say, War of the Worlds, where humanity was unquestionably outclassed) aliens with star-spanning technologies seem to think that we humans are a big deal. That we are a problem and a challenge that needs to be addressed. I mean, if I move into a house and find it is full of vermin, I don't shoot up the floor boards to get rid of the pests. So, why don't the aliens just hose down the atmosphere with an appropriate vermicide to get rid of us pesky apes?Or why is it that the alien weaponry is only a decade or so ahead of ours? Why the need to engage in toe-to-toe boots-on-the-ground combat behavior with us? Is it simply a need to generate drama (admittedly, people dropping like flies, and then aliens dropping out of the sky to sweep us into bins, isn't particularly engaging theatrically, but a lot more realistic).But it occurs to me that this type of action is similar to the masturbatory TV trope theme of Frankenstein versus The Wolfman, or some such related stoned adolescent stupidity. My understanding is the latest incarnation of this is the Reddit phenomenon of Rome Sweet Rome, wherein a modern Marine unit ends up transported back in time to ancient Rome, and an exploration is undertaken about the all-important question of just how much ass would the marines kick? (Realistically? The Marines are doomed).Well, this is the Trapped in the Past theme, and there are two behaviors, either try to live a normal and quiet life, or Change Things For The Better. Not many choose the former, and not that surprising entertainment wise.I can think of one fairly mature treatment by Rod Serling, a Twilight Zone episode called \"The 7th is Made up of Phantoms\", where a modern tank crew ends up at the Battle of Little Bighorn, and naturally is doomed.Or the granddaddy of them all, Twain's \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" with the hilariously comical slaughter at the climax of the book, involving machine guns and electrocution, if that is your idea of funny.So, it sure seems like, if you are a technologically advanced group facing a primitive and backward savage culture, best to just lay low and not draw too much attention to yourself. And if you are an interstellar expedition that finds yourself in Earth's Solar System, maybe just harvest what you need from the asteroids or the Moon. Those don't fight back - too much.Oh, and my Space Invaders movie? How to explain the close similarity of combat technology?Well, taking a page from Battle Los Angeles, where the humans finally figure out how to \"kick ET's Ass\" on their own brutish terms. My movie ends with LA in ruins, the aliens calling for a ceasefire with  the humans, striding up to the Marine commander, taking off their bubble space helmets, extending a hand outwards and saying:\"Good game, man! Good game! See you next year!\""},

What if we went through the phase change and now this is the new normal? What if, come June, the temperatures are a steady 120F? And the month of August never gets below 140F?\" Face it, even the most rabid climate change denial type had to have had experienced just the slightest frisson of foreboding. Personally, I have a dollar bet that the arctic becomes permanently ice free during the summer come 2015. I suspect I'm going to collect that dollar.Well, I do have friends who are going through that particular cognitive dissonance known as global warming denial, despite the fact that the weather is getting weirder, the arctic ice is shrinking, the upper latitudes are warming twice as fast, and getting ready to dump a whole bunch of methane into the atmosphere, they are convinced that anyone who believes in global warming is a fool. So, I guess it is going to take a phase change to convince them otherwise. Naturally, it will be the places that least need it that will experience the worst. The American Southwest is one such place.Now, if there is any place in the United States of America that ought to serve as an object lesson, a true lesson of history as to how you should be prepared to live, it's got to be the Southwest, with it's ruins of pueblo village such as Mesa Verde, and Chaco Canyon. So naturally, if you are to settle anyplace that is already arid, you'd possess a certain predisposition towards hardship, a ready willingness to ape the ant, to be a tough and fibrous creature that stores up for hard and bleak times. What you wouldn't be is some type of soft, sloppy spendthrift, demanding green lawns, golf courses, the sidewalk-and-gutter, two car garage lifestyle of the more luxuriantly water blessed regions back East, or up North.But, apparently, we Americans are just as deluded as the Indians and Spaniards that came before us. Build big dams, cut big ditches, make big plans, force Nature to service us, and ignore the whole long past history of the region, which is: fire, dead trees, dust and thirst. So, it won't surprise me not a bit when 30 to 50 million people, some five to ten years down the line, suddenly find themselves with a comical slackjawed \"Oh!\" of an expression on their fat, stupid faces when they get gut-punched by their hubris.And the saddest part is, an extended drought, a decades long megadrought, is not going to be the type of hardship that will bring people together. Time and again, during catastrophe, people do have a tendency to be neighborly, to be altruistic and giving, but not during a drought. People compete, people get cranky and selfish, and nothing productive gets done Some inklings of this are already seen in how the states of the region compete for water.Arizona, it would seem, does a very good job of representing almost everything that is wrong with America. This is not to say that there are not good people living there, or good people that have lived there for several centuries - even including the Anglos, who have modified their behavior to live in the land. Tucson, it would seem, has done well in this regard, as they realize they a desert town.So, let me modify my statement, and hone it down to the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Sun Corridor, as representative of the worst American characteristics. Take, for example, their self-righteous and mercenary spirit, proudly ignorant of their subsidized condition, ruggedly individualistic and possessed of a manic private property fetish, and all the while convinced of their innate and inherent right to privilege. Defiantly white, Protestant, English-only, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino, devoted fans of right-wing television and talk radio. Zealots, angry, unappreciative, and dementedly entitled, made all the worse by the fact that they, retiree immigrants from places like Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Little Rock, Duluth, don't seem to realize that they are the alien invaders. They may be frightened and confused by the people they deem foreign in language, looks, values, and behavior, but they just don't seem capable of realizing that these are the centuries-old inhabitants of the region.Nor do they understand their utter dependance upon the divine grace of the federal government, who provides them with their very existence. Without the vast expenditures and engineering projects that the Bureau of Water Reclamation, their would be no sun Corridor, no Mountain Megacity, no air-conditioned paradise, and, given the long term climatic trends, will there be . They are doomed. Fucked. And probably just as well.   This is not to say the region will be abandoned entirely. People will still live there. They'll just live more realistically, and the ones that don't leave. But the ones that leave? What should we do with them? Do we really want these selfish, short-sighted, unpleasant peoples to settle among us?I wonder, would these refugees develop some sense of empathy for the present plight of a similarly straightened peoples, just south of their border?"},
{"title": "\"The Stealth of Nations\": A Book Report", "date": "Tuesday, March 27, 2012", "text": "System D, the second largest economy in the world, is covered in the book \"The Stealth of Nations: The Global Rise of the Informal Economy\" by Robert Neuwirth. An excerpt of the book can be found in this article at Foreign Policy.If you are wondering how Neuwirth can be a cheerleader for the black market, well, there's a lot to like in this book. Everyone appreciates the virtues of a constructive life, the struggles, the hustles, the triumphs, the setbacks, the inherent dignity of self-sufficiency (such as it can be for social creatures), and most importantly the ingenuity and clever workarounds that are displayed by the more-than-clever-by-half human animal. And there are stories aplenty in this book of people who have made good*, from Sao Paulo to Lagos, from Shanghai to Mumbai.My chief complaint is not the extensive use of theft, piracy, smuggling, evasion, graft, bribery, corruption, and venality that is endemic throughout System D. This is, after all, business with a big B as usual on Planet Earth, \"building a better world, one deal at a time\".Why, I'd be downright disappointed if the private sector types didn't lie, cheat, and steal. We are talking about Commerce after all, which has it's very foundational social contracts well embedded in the concepts of force and fraud.No, my chief complaint with Mr. Neuwirth's cheerleading is that he presents this system as perhaps something new, perhaps the next big thing. System D is, in fact, old, terribly old, an old and tested system that I suspect goes back possibly 250,000 years, to the first behaviorally modern humans.Neuwirth himself is not blind to this, but chooses to consistently gloss over the inconvenient parts.Take, for example, his recognition that one of the pitfalls of the cash-based economy of System D is that it is cash based. There is a twofold problem here. The first being that cash is subject to exchange rates and their fluctuations. The economic underground is dependent upon national currencies. In short, the State and the Market are not conflict with each other, but wholly interdependent. Thus, cannot exist without nation states. The second problem being that, since everything is cash-based, no system of leveraged debt is available to expand a worthwhile enterprise. Unfortunately, the next step after the market, is, so far, capitalism, which, if System D will evolve into if it manages to go \"legit\". Which sucks, because we are just now finding out the full consequences of this particular item tucked in the Neolithic cultural package, just as we are only now fully understanding the full impact of the lever and fulcrum, the wheel, the pulley, the screw, and the inclined plane.Furthering my complaint is the depiction of System D as an open source network. System D certainly opens market opportunities to those traditionally shut out, but it does not, by any stretch of the imagination, operate as science does, with (hopefully) unrestricted information dissemination or any form of egalitarian reward sharing. Merchants in System D rely on arbitrage as surely as your average hedge fund scumbag does. Information is jealously guarded, and scheming is an integral part of the game. And workers in System D still operate under a hierarchical labor structure where the lion's share of the profits go to the traders, and only a small slice ends up at the level of the industrious laborer. There are no discussion about wages in System D business meetings.Nor does System D seem to be any better at capitalism in learning lessons. Take, for example, copyrights and piracy. And long and noble tradition of piracy and counterfeiting extends well past so-called civilized times to some 40,00 years ago when carved stone and ceramic fake seashells were traded. The problem with this version is the ironic complaint among System D merchants that other merchants can copy your pirated goods and undercut you profit. (Indeed, some companies in China, realizing that a race to the bottom results in increasingly razor-thin profits, have opted for the opposite route of creating quality brands). There is a supposed advantage to having a regulatory agency or institution assuring honest quality. True, for the past 10,000 years, the State has offered just such services to the market - quality assurance, arbitration, and universally equitable transactions, but not everyone shares a complete trust of the State (and who can blame them, with the undue influence of those lucky enough to control wealth?). Still, this certainly presents an entrepreneurial niche to System D merchants to provide for such an agency, but then again, you merely head towards the \"modern\" institutions of capitalism like Sotheby's and Standard Oil. And speaking of the State, would some form of System D exist in regions of the world where governments actually worked? Take Nigeria, where there is no water system, little electricity, the roads paved first in front of the homes of the rich and well-connected, the government clearly cannot demonstrate its worthiness to the people. Is it any small wonder that taxes are not paid, if the State will not recognized its smallest responsibilities?I could go, but let's face it, we in America are in no position to play holier than thou.In summary I say more power to them, maybe they can forge a new better way, but I ain't seeing it.I really cannot see the difference between the social and economic setup between System D and life in the developed capitalist world. If anything, when it comes to the most vile business practices, coupled with a legal system crafted for the top parasites, we show the inhabitants of System D to be mere pikers.* \"Ralph Makes Good\" by Wally Cox. I could not find a worthwhile link to this short and wonderful book, written in 1965 and long out of print, but here's a great summary from Kirkus reviews:\"Ralph is a self-made man, new in town and so happily stupid that he must have come there straight from an eggshell. On the advice of his barber, Ralph began as a lawn mower, shrewdly shifting to leaf raker with the seasonal decline of grass. One glimpse of Sylvia and a vision of bigger things enthralled him. He ran against the mayor, '...a dependable criminal in the old tradition', and emerged as dogcatcher, a political position threatened by impeachment and lynching before Ralph makes good -- and Sylvia, the dime a dance girl. It is the lightest of featherweight satire on local government, among other things, and this form has a banty-sized audience today. The famous comedian author entry may help counteract some of the reader apathy as well as the delight Cox takes in converting the precise use of words into literary wit.\""},
{"title": "The Franz Ferdinand Divergences", "date": "Monday, March 26, 2012", "text": "One of the difficulties of operating a peranoscope is that big changes are never the result of one single cause. Thus, when confronted with a big series of divergences, it can rarely be traced back to a single branch point. To use another analogy, using a peranoscope under the best of conditions is similar in many ways to peering into a Magic Eight Ball.\"Reply hazy, try again\".Take, for example, the First World War. From my perspective, it is not even a century since it's beginning, which was the 28th of July, 1914. Many historians will tell you that WWI was inevitable - that once the first domino was pushed all others would fall. That the entangling alliances of the Great Powers were too closely knotted, the alarm tripwires too taut, the personalities and circumstances all leaning inwards towards war, like the rotted frame of a house.A PeranoscopeConsider the Franz Ferdinand Divergences. They generally start with Gavrilo Princip, the Serbian terrorist, missing his shot at the Archduke by a millisecond (not inconceivable, a policeman had lunged at Princip's hand). The Archduke and his wife are whisked away to safety. As a result, Israel never exists. Israel does not exist without WWII and the Holocaust. The Holocaust does not occur if Hitler never comes to power. Hitler never comes to power if the Germans are not starved throughout the first war, and starved and humiliated in the year following the armistice of 1918. The armistice does not occur if WWI never happens. WWI never happens if the Archduke Franz Ferdinand is not assassinated in Sarajevo.Oh, bullshit. I wish it all were that simple.The Emperor Francis Joseph I's hotheaded Chief of Staff, Conrad von Hötzendorf, knowing the assassination plot originated in Serbia, would have demanded war. Ferdinand, a consistent moderate in the past, would have demurred. In fact, Ferdinand, as in prior crises, reminded the Chief of Staff and the Emperor that war with Serbia meant war with Russia. War with Russia would have meant the certain end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Ferdinand would have argued this, and Emperor Francis Joseph would have agreed. It is true that friction with Serbia over the Balkans may have continued, but these crises had been going ever since the annexation of Bosnia-Herzgovina since 1908.So, fast forward to November 21st, 1916, Francis Joseph I is dead. Franz Ferdinand is crowned Emperor.Oh, wait a minute. Rewind. A few things can occur during those two years. Most imperative, Great Britain is plunged into civil war. Great Britain and Ireland that is, and over Ulster. Without WWI, the Government of Ireland Act of 1914 is enacted, Home Rule comes to Southern Ireland and the insurrection of Northern Ireland breaks out in utter foment. With civil war, dividing even parts of the army, the entire Expeditionary Force, the Special Reserve, and the Territorial Army are required to restore order. The Troubles, as they come to be known, had started.Had Germany declared war on France, and invaded through Belgium (the cause for Great Britain's entering war), the BEF, pinned down in Ireland, could not possibly aid France. Without the BEF in those first bloody crucial months, the Germans would have marched into Paris.It's a good thing then, that Germany does not declare war on France (aside from the fact that one million men will still be alive come October 1914). Germany does not declare war on Russia and France because Austria-Hungary does not declare war on Serbia. There are, of course, several ongoing crises throughout Europe, but all are settled diplomatically as had happened with others, such as the Bosnian Crisis of 1908, or the Morocco Crisis of 1911, or the Balkan Wars of 1912, or the... well, you get the picture.What happens in America? Keep in mind, the mood of the country is that the US economic model is broken (though not spoken of in those terms), the Socialist movement is making great gains in popularity. 1914 is the beginning year of a serious recession. Businesses throughout the country were depressed, farm prices deflated, unemployment serious, heavy industries working far below capacity and bank clearings were off. Without the 1915 war orders from the Allies of WWI, an economic stimulus never occurred and the recession deepened. The Panic of 1916 helped matters not at all, and the public mood became ugly. No polls existed then, but it is estimated some 74% of Americans felt that they were not adequately rewarded for their hard work and skill, and that the idle rich, possessed of  almost all the nation's wealth, truly were living off the backs of the industrious poor. The ruling classes, seeing the country ripe for a number of violent upheavals, were forced to co-opt from the pages of the Progressives as had been done earlier by Teddy Roosevelt during the so-called \"reform\" movements of his administration. In a handy bit of political ju-jitsu (involving both violent repression and political reform), the ruling classes enacted a series of laws and subsidies to keep the citizens of the United States pacified. The great Social Experiment, as it came to be known, or by others, ironically, as the \"New Socialist Paradise\", produced the large social assistance programs similar to those enacted by Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s (in a different reality). There was hardly a choice. The bankers and industrialists would surely have lost everything in the ensuing revolution (which in itself was an interesting - if short-lived - divergence), or at least through government nationalization of the market. But, as it was in prior crises, the shit managed to float on top. What was perhaps unnoticed through the enactment of these laws was the ongoing erosion of the Bill of Rights, through the Securitization Act, the Right to Work Act, and the Militia Act, which put restrictions on first and second amendment rights. These acts were all upheld by the Supreme Court. The foremost liberal of the land, Oliver Wendell Holmes, in a superbly clever and attractive treatment, supplied the rationale to justify these laws. Well, as the old Vulcan saying goes, \"Only Nixon could go to China\". Of course, the recession turned into a depression which lasted well into the late 1920s, but at least the populace was placated and endured the downturn.Couple these circumstances with the series of events which made America the military laughingstock of the world, and you have a formula against immediate global influence. The continued disastrous military adventures carried out under the one-term Wilson administration - the inept military adventure into Mexico, the debacle of US troops being slaughtered in Siberia aiding the failed Bolshevik movement during the Russian Civil War, the humiliating retreat from the Philippines in 1917 - all soured the public appetite for foreign adventurism, and solidified the already deep and endemic isolationist streak within the American character. It would take another generation for the United States to move from being a continental to a world power.And Russia? The one seeming inevitability is the fall of Tsar Nicholas II. The debacle of the 1905 war against Japan and subsequent Revolution of 1905 determined the fate of the Romanovs. Despite continued and ongoing land reforms, the sheer incompetence of the Tsar himself guaranteed his eventual downfall in November 1914. Had it not been for the intervention of his cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm, \"Nicky\" and his family would surely have perished. They eventually resided in Denmark. The Kaiser also, very conveniently on the advice of his generals, had V.I. Lenin assassinated while in still exile. The loose factions of the Reds never quite congealed, and after a brief turning towards democracy under Kerensky, Russia returned true to form under the dictatorship of President Julius Martov.  Despite modernization programs instituted under Martov, Russia remains relatively backwards well into the 1930s.  (An interesting side note, if you will indulge me. Typically, fictional depictions of alternate timelines often make the mistake of using familiar characters from history populating these people scenarios - even though the chances of them even existing are near impossible. Funny then, how many familiar historical characters continue to exist in the Franz Ferdinand Divergences. Indeed, these tightly bound  alternatives do not start to unravel until the early 1940s - as you will see).The USGASo, continental Europe tense but peaceful, England heavily involved in internal strife, Franz Ferdinand ascends the thousand-year-old Habsburg throne. As a young man, Franz Ferdinand toured the United States by train. Ferdinand sought an American, a Federalist, solution to the ills of his thousand-year-old empire. Foremost was the Southern Slav question, the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovinia had burdened Austria with a restive Slav population owing more allegiance to neighboring Serbia. (Indeed, the Serbian Black Hand organization sought the Ferdinand's death to prevent his federalization program). Upon ascension to the throne, Ferdinand immediately implemented the formation of \"Die Vereinigten Staaten von Groß-Österreich\", or as we know it, the USGA, The United States of Greater Austria. The formation was not without its birth pangs. At one point, Ferdinand requested help from his friend \"Willy\", Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, who sent \"Franzi\" a division of crack Prussian troops to quell the Magyar Rebellion in Hungary. But once things settled down, the diverse ethnic governments cooperated in a remarkably cohesive and congenial manner. Even Bosnia-Herzegovinia, after a popular referendum favored reuniting with Serbia, was allowed to return, and good riddance. Relations with the Balkans improved dramatically. The Empire was saved from certain implosion.In fact, conditions both economic and social improved considerably. Despite Ferdinand's reactionary personality, not to mention his loathsome anti-Semitism, he embarked upon a series of social and education reforms which uplifted and improved the conditions of  all segments of the general populace. Major universities were expanded through a program of free education, and valued talents (especially in the areas of mathematics and physics) were attracted to the vibrant atmospheres of cities such as Graz, Vienna, Prague, Cracow, and Budapest for the remainder of 1910s and onward. The whole of Germany and the USGA prospered as industry and academia cooperated to produce a seeming endless series of innovations and inventions. The flowering of Quantum Mechanics results in practical applications such as radio, radar, TV, vacuum tubes, transistors, aviation, jet engines, rocket engines, and the beginnings of the computer age, all created within Central Europe. A stellar constellation of talents, among them Albert Einstein, John von Neumann, Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, Enrico Fermi, and Hans Bethe flocked to the University of Vienna. Not surprising, then, that the USGA, in cooperation with the German Empire, developed the atomic bomb. The first atomic pile is constructed by Enrico Fermi in Trieste, on January 5th, 1925. The first test occurred in the Kalahari desert, east of the town of Gobabis, on July 23rd, 1928. MittelEuropaBy 1930, Germany and the USGA, all but in name unified as one, have been joined by the Kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Belgium, etc. to form a loose confederation of mutual economic and political interests. It is the world's preeminent economic powerhouse. The Great Powers of the world now confront the Greater Power of MittelEuropa. The race to play catchup is all consuming, but especially so to the US of A (catchup being that \"most American of games\"), finally coming out of it's decade long funk.Which brings us to the Devastation (I told you this was a divergence). Back in the second term of President Charles Evans Hughes, Sr. (Republican three term president 1916-1928), the War Department embarked upon an intensive program of modernization. With the loss of American Pacific possessions to the Japanese Empire, it was felt that, in a modern era of aeroplanes and missiles, the separation of two oceans was no longer a sufficient barrier to threatening powers. In the Pacific, the Empire of Japan had, with no real opposition, engulfed all of EastAsia. The Colossus known as Europe (for at this point, both France and Russia were obliged, hat in hand, to work with Central Europe, which controlled huge swaths of Africa, and almost all of Eurasia. Britain, through culture and circumstance, and the seeming advantageous contingency of her colonial empire, chose to side with America, and together, they could be defined as Oceania. By 1940 all the triggers were in place for a war over resource extraction, and Africa was the prize.Espionage had transferred the nuclear secrets into the hands of the Americans. By the late 1930s, under a crash program, they had developed their own nuclear weapon, exploded in New Mexico, in 1939, and proceeded to work on their arsenal.Unbeknownst to the Americans, an engineering team in Vienna led by Edward Teller had developed \"Die Super\", the H-bomb, the thermonuclear fusion bomb. By 1944, their H-bomb had been miniaturized enough to be delivered via rocket. Unfortunately, through a staged bit of theatrical victimization claiming surprise attack, America declared war on June 6th, 1944. American bombers, loaded with fission bombs, departed air bases in England. Two bombers managed to deliver their cargo - one on Antwerp, the other on Hamburg.Soon afterwards, dozens of ICBMs equipped with megaton range thermonuclear warheads were launched against the American homeland. Some ninety million people are wiped out in minutes. President Winston Smith vows never surrender, and the sheer horror of the mass slaughter turns the world against Europe. Sufficient nuclear weapons remain on both sides to cause decades long strife, so much so that by early 1984, those few humans left alive, if you can call such specimens human, have been reduced back to the Stone Age. And soon after that, they all perish.And just as well, don't you think?"},
{"title": "The Science of Investment Materials", "date": "Wednesday, March 21, 2012", "text": "I have no backup copy of this essay, and I'm worried that the original post at warmglass.com will eventually disappear, so I'm posting the essay here as a precaution.All of the papers listed were found in the Journal of Dental Research, and I will repost all of the URLs. For those of you unwilling or unable to follow the papers, I’ll do my best with summaries. Over the past year, I’ve also bought and read a few more advanced materials science papers on the subject through Science Direct. There are no URLs available for these papers (they are all restricted PDFs). I’ve also found some helpful downloads available at http://www.netzsch-thermal-analysis.com/. These are available under their Literature link, and are free. Just register to look at them. I’ve borrowed and modified a lot of the data from the restricted papers and the Netzsch site into visual graphs, which will hopefully be more helpful than all of the technical jargon. (Be forewarned, there is technical jargon involved in the following text, but I will try to explain it as we go along).Throughout the literature, the primary material of interest is gypsum. This is as it should be. Gypsum, or calcium sulfate, or the calcium salts of sulfuric acid, chemical formula CaSO4, is the binder of first choice in traditional investments. (I prefer the term gypsum, instead of plaster, as a more general descriptive term for calcium sulfate. Plaster, in my mind, refers only to the form known as calcium sulfate hemihydrate). There’s any number of substitute binders available, from magnesia- and phosphate-based binders, through the colloids of silica, alumina, zirconia, etc. Substitute binders are all refractory (can take the heat), and most are relatively chemically inert at high temperatures. But not all are as readily available, as easily frangible (breakable) upon casting completion, and, most importantly, as dirt cheap as gypsum. Gypsum shrinks upon heating, so other components – known as fillers or extenders - are added to the investment that will counteract this shrinkage. One such extender is silica – either as powder, sand, clay, grog, etc. Silica is fairly refractory, readily available, and again, dirt cheap. (One popular misconception is that silica, or other extenders such as alumina, talc, etc., are added to make the investment more refractory. As you will read later, this is simply not true). Let’s start off with the granddaddy of the papers, first published in 1931, “Dental Casting Technic: Theory and Practice”, available at: http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/11/5/681.pdf.This is a good beginning paper describing the behavior of gypsum-bonded investments, especially the thermal expansion behavior and influence of water/powder ratio. It allowed me to produce the following graph:According to the paper, gypsum shrinks up to 2% in volume when heated. Silica expands when heated.All of the allotropic (solid exhibiting more than one crystalline state) forms of silica (tridymite, cristobalite, quartz, and fused silica) expand.All of the forms, with the exception of fused silica (amorphous silica, e.g. glass), undergo phase transformations (changes in molecular structure). The transformation of quartz is possibly familiar to you, and is often called the quartz inversion. The quartz inversion occurs between about 500-600C (932-1112F), and results in a rapid expansion of the material. Cristobalite also undergoes a much more drastic expansion in the range 240-275C (490-527F). For silica, these transformations are reversible. Gypsum also undergoes phase transformations, but these are not reversible.Varying the percentage of gypsum to silica can change the expansion profile of the investment material. This is a very easy way of controlling the thermal expansion of your molds. Here are some examples of the thermal expansion profile of different percentage mixes:The next paper is “Thermal Behavior of the Gypsum Binder in Dental Casting Investments”, a must read in my opinion, and available here: http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/65/6/877.pdf.Gypsum, or calcium sulfate, going from room to glass casting temperature and beyond, undergoes a number of phase transformations that all result in irreversible contractions. Dehydration of investment occurs in a double step process. Let’s start the cast investment at room temperature. The first form of gypsum is plaster – calcium sulfate dihydrate: CaSO4 + 2 H2O.The idealized structure of pure gypsum consists of lattice planes of calcium sulfate molecules weakly bonded to alternating layers of water. The bond is an ionic one between the oxygen atoms and the hydrogen atoms in water – very easily broken. Water thus weakly bonded is often called the water of crystallization. As gypsum is heated, the water is diffused out of the matrix, and the plaster converts to calcium sulfate hemihydrate: CaSO4 + ½ H2O. (Obviously, there is not half a molecule of water, one water molecule is shared by two calcium sulfate molecules). This conversion is completed at 177C (350F). This is step 1.Further heating of the investment will release all remaining water. This occurs at 200C (392F). This is step 2. In numerous DTA (Differential Thermal Analysis), and DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) experiments, this double step can be seen as two endothermal (heat-releasing) peaks. In other words, as the temperature was increased, the heat capacity of the material jumped, which resulted in less heating required to increase the temperature. What this also means is that 100% dehydration did not magically occur at 200C (392F). It takes time for the water to completely disperse from the matrix. The second endothermal peak does not bottom out – indicating 100% dehydration - until about 300C (572F).Here’s a fun little graph from Netzsch, that illustrates what I just said: http://www.netzsch-thermal-analysis.com/en/materials-applications/ceramics-glass/gypsum-and-quartz-sand-phase-transitions.html. The graph shows two curves. The first curve shows the TG profile of gypsum over temperature range (TG means “thermogravitic” which is just a fancy term for “as we heated it up, we weighed it\"). The TG curve shows the thermal behavior of gypsum over temperature. The second curve is the DSC profile, which shows the heat capacity of the material. For an explaination of what Differential Scanning Calorimetry is and what it means, here is a URL: http://pslc.ws/macrog//dsc.htm. Yes, yes. I know its a web page about plastics. Amorphous polymers behave like glass. They have a glass transition range, and can undergo devitrification. In fact, pretty much any material, heated up and cooled correctly, can go through a glass phase - including metals. This has been well-documented since the 1960s. (And if you don't know what a glass transition is, maybe you should do a little googling, or maybe a lot). (A popular misconception is that steam can crack a mold if all the water is not removed. It will take some time for a solid block of investment to release all the water. While this is occurring, the varying temperatures within the block of investment will be well below or near the boiling point of water - due to escaping water drawing heat from the mold through evaporation. True, there is a point where the surface and exterior layers of the mold will start to calcine, as the remaining water cannot evaporate quickly enough to cool it. But regardless of the air temperature within the kiln, the mold will remain “cold” while water is within it. Since the water diffuses out of the matrix at about the same pressure as sea level atmosphere, it is impossible for steam pressure to crack the mold – simply because there is no steam within the mold to begin with. This is not to say you can crank the kiln temperature with a wet mold. An unnecessarily fast heating rate can and will crack a mold. As the outer layers dry out, they will undergo a different thermal expansion than the interior layers. This puts tension of the outer layers, which causes cracking. In short, an excessive heating rate will crack a mold – not steam).Once the mold is completely dehydrated, the hemihydrate has converted to anhydrite: CaSO4 + 0 H2O. (Obviously, each form of gypsum does not convert instantaneously upon hitting a temperature benchmark. It is a continuous conversion, and each phase retains some quantity of the last phase, which slowly converts. So, the dihydrate has some small portion of unreacted hemihydrate, and the anhydrite, some portion of hemihydrate, etc). As noted in the above paper, Posnjak (1938) introduced the terminology of naming the three polymorphic forms of anhydrite alpha, beta, and gamma. However, confusion can occur with existing terms used in the gypsum industry for alpha and beta hemihydrate powders (produced by the wet or dry calcining methods, respectively). I therefore use the same terminology in describing anhydrite as is used in the paper, namely III-, II-, and I-CaSO4.(A quick aside here. As noted above, the hemihydrate of gypsum, plaster, call it what you will, can come in one of two forms - alpha and beta. Alpha hemihydrate is traditionally produced by heating a sized gypsum or lump rock under elevated steam pressure in an autoclave. Beta hemihydrate is produced by heating finely ground gypsum at atmospheric pressure. Beta hemihydrate consists of rough, fractured, fragmented particles, and has the attractive properties of high plasticity, high compressive strength, and high density. Alpha hemihydrate consists of finer, denser, more well-formed and orderly crystals than the beta. Alpha has a higher set strength than the beta, and produces molds and patterns of high accuracy, high surface hardness, and low expansion during drying and curing, and is, to some extent, machinable. Most products are made up of a blend of the alpha and beta forms. Some products, such as mixtures for potter's plaster and gypsum wallboard, contain only the beta. Other products, such as Hydrocal FGR-95 or 115 Gypsum Cement, consist of only the alpha form). At 200C (392F) gypsum exists in the form of III-CaSO4 (and increasingly small portions of hemihydrate). III-CaSO4 is also known as soluble anhydrite, which is metastable. This means the III-CaSO4 would convert back to hemihydrate if removed from the kiln and exposed to atmospheric moisture. Paraphrased from the paper: “This is a familiar phenomenon encountered in the manufacture of (gypsum). The freshly calcined material possesses the property of rapidly absorbing moisture from the air with a marked increase in temperature, requires large amounts of water in mixing, product sets too rapidly (“fiery”), but it may set too slowly. The mixing characteristics of (gypsum) improve if the powder is allowed to mature under ambient air in storage (aging)”. In other words, you could, for what arcane reason I know not, remove your dehydrated mold from the kiln, place it in a bucket of water, and return it to a liquid slurry. Or grind it up, let it age in air, and then remix it later with water into another mold. Thus the term soluble anhydrite.Upon continued heating, the largest shrinkage will occur in the range of 348-400C (658-752F), which is accompanied by an exothermal (heat absorbing) reaction. This marks the conversion of metastable III-CaSO4 into stable II-CaSO4, or soluble anhydrite into insoluble anhydrite. This is a phase transformation in which the “crystalline hexagonal needle shape of III-CaSO4 converts to thicker, shorter needles of orthorhombic crystals of the II-CaSO4”. Under experimental recovery (cooling and rehydration of investment), it was found to reach zero recovery for the temperature of 800C (1472F). In other words, all III-CaSO4 was completely converted to II-CaSO4 by 800C (1472F). Paraphrased from the paper: “This is also a familiar phenomenon in the manufacture of plaster. Gypsum that has been heated to a red heat becomes inert in water and is called ‘dead burnt’”. (In a different thread, I investigated a hypothesis that this conversion range, when III-CaSO4 converts to II-CaSO4, might require a more delicate touch in the heating schedule, and that molds were more prone to crack here than in other parts of the ramp-up. The idea being that, with the lowest point of thermal conductivity occurring here, along with the inevitable non-uniform temperature gradient between interior and exterior mold layers, would produce conflicting compressive and tensile tangential forces in the mold wall, resulting in the symptom known as a “crack”. The consequence being that you could put short cuts in the heating schedule – heat faster in other parts of the ramp-up, and just go slow in this “danger zone”. So far, the hypothesis has not been proven, and no danger zone found).Let’s shoot past the (to me) relatively mild glass casting temperatures, to get to the II-I conversion. II-CaSO4 converts to I-CaSO4 at around 1227C (2240F). This crystal form has been reported as “cubic”, density of gypsum increases slightly, and is the result of crystals sintering together. Not much else to say about it, really, except that you can still cast glass in it if you wanted to - with a few provisos coming up.Various temperatures have been tossed out for the thermal breakdown temperature for gypsum. By “breakdown” I mean the thermal decomposition of chemical bonds. They have varied wildly, from as low as 700C (1292F) to as high as 1500C (2732F). The reason for the discrepancy is interesting. Calcium sulfate breaks down according to the following reactions:CaSO4 ==> CaO + SO3SO3 ==> SO2 + ½ O2The above formulas are as follows: CaSO4 is calcium sulfate (gypsum), CaO is calcium oxide (lime, quicklime, a caustic alkali, refractory up to 2572C (4661F)), SO3 is sulfur trioxide, and SO2 sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide is a gas highly corrosive to metals, producing an insoluble sulfide on the surface of castings, making it a bugaboo in the jewelry and dental trades. But sulfur dioxide actually strengthens glass, producing a surface substance known as “bloom”. This is a white deposit that forms on glass and is easily washed off. It improves the durability of glass by removing alkalis such as sodium from the glass matrix – an effect known from the wood, oil and coal-burning days of lehrs and annealers. This \"dealkalization\" reaction is an ion exchange that is made possible by the removal of the sodium ion as sodium sulfate. The general chemical reaction is:2Na (glass) + SO2 + ½ O2 + H2O ==> 2H (glass) + Na2SO4It has been determined – under repeated and rigorous laboratory conditions – that calcium sulfate breakdown commences at about 1240C (2264F) and is practically complete at 1450C (2642F). Melting of a CaO/CaSO4 eutectic mixture occurs at around 1350C (2516F), so we will set the upper usable casting limit of gypsum at 1230C (2246F). That’s a pretty good temperature, but, of course, not really realistic. Gypsum could be used as a casting medium, but as we have seen, it drastically shrinks. If dimensional fidelity (cast piece is the same size as the wax piece – kind of important when making dental inlays) is an issue, then you either scale up the size of the wax, or include a material that expands upon heating, like silica.The addition of silica (SiO2) produces a different chemical reaction:CaSO4 + SiO2 ==> CaSiO3 + SO3SO3 ==> SO2 + ½ O2CaSiO3 is one variant of calcium silicate, which is highly refractory (up to around 1540C (2804F)), possesses high strength, and is used extensively for high temperature insulation (especially by your friends at ZIRCAR). The energy required for the gypsum/silica decomposition to occur is far less than for pure gypsum. As a result, the beginning of thermal decomposition is lowered to 990C (1814F), and is practically complete at 1260C (2300F).The following chart graphically demonstrates the difference in decomposition via a TG curve:(The above graph and information was obtained from the paper “Thermal and Microchemical Characterisations of CaSO4 – SiO2 Investment Materials” by G.M. Ingo et. al).Being conservative, and using the beginning temperature for thermal decomposition as the maximum, one could soak safely at 989C (1812F) for an indefinite length of time! That’s well beyond normal glass casting temperatures. However, carbon also plays a role. Any burnout of organic materials in a mold will leave a halo of carbon residue embedded around the casting. The presence of carbon will reduce the decomposition temperature, as described in “Decomposition of Gypsum Investment in the Presence of Carbon”, available at: http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/3/541.pdf.With carbon present in gypsum-silica investment, the following reaction will occur:CaSO4 + 4C ==> CaS + 4CO3 CaSO4 + CaS ==> 4CaO + 4SO2CaO + SiO2 ==> CaSiO3CaS is calcium sulfide, which acts as a catalyst causing a chain reaction to occur, rapidly converting calcium sulfate into calcium oxide. Carbon acts as a flux, lowering the temperature of the reaction. This reaction is well known and happily taken advantage of by chemists in the concrete manufacturing and steel industries. Coke and limestone is used to draw silicates out of iron ore, producing calcium silicate slag. The above reaction starts to take place at 700C (1292F). The decomposition is displayed in the following chart:Is this thermal breakdown necessarily bad news for glass casters? In terms of structural integrity, the effect is almost nil. You have already ruined any structural integrity the mold possessed by dehydrating it. It is probably a good bet that calcium silicate does not react with the glass. And the mold will be just as refractory as when it was composed entirely of gypsum-silica, especially when you consider that calcium silicate is an ingredient in refractory cements and investments used in metal casting, such as Hydroperm. However, the thermal expansion, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity characteristics of the mold have changed because of the new compounds created. How much exactly, I’ve not been able to ascertain. But I suspect the thermal expansion of the new mold composition to be much less than the original mold composition. And if some portions of the mold remain unaffected, you are creating thermal strain that is at least different, and quite probably far worse, than a uniform block of material. If you can avoid the introduction of carbon into your mold, I would advise doing so. But it appears gypsum-silica investments are much tougher than we have been led to believe. Prepared and treated properly, it can take the heat, and for long durations.A quick note on water/powder ratios. Ralph Carter, a chemist at Ransom & Randolph, presented a paper on the subejct which can be found here: http://www.ransom-randolph.com/Effect_of_Changing_Water_Powder_Ratio_on_JI.pdfThe water/powder ratio may be the most critical aspect of investment mold making - or it may not be. Varying the water/powder ratio will certainly change the the thermal conductivity of the investment, as well as the expansion profile. The W/P ratio usually varies from .28 (28 parts water to 100 parts investment) to .50 (.50 is 1 part water to 2 parts powder). Less water within this range, and the investment paste is too stiff to give a good impression, more water than this range, and the investment may be too weak to stand the ramp up in your firing. W/P ratio also affects the porosity of your investment. Porosity is defined as a percentage, and can be determined by weight. Weigh the investment after setting at room temperature, and again after dehydration (this is called the bulk/matrix ratio). The result will be the percent porosity of your investment. I think you will be surprised to find out that mold porosity is around 60% (give or take). Here’s a visual aid:The needle shapes are calcium sulfate crystals, the larger conchoidal shapes are silica particles. The black stuff in between is empty space – filled with water when hydrated, air when it is not. That’s definitely porous. Porosity changes the thermal profile of the investment. More porous means less density, and less thermally conductive. On the other hand, highly porous materials reduce crack propagation. The \"holes\" tend to stop cracks - similar to drilling a hole at the end of a crack in a piece of glass or fatigued metal.Perhaps the best illustration of the effects of the w/p ratio can be seen Chart 6 of Carter's paper. This chart lists the \"fired\" compressive strength of various mixtures. The terms \"green-\" and \"fired-\" strength, borrowed from ceramics, are not particularly helpful. A ceramic material will be stronger after firing. Investment is strongest once it is set - when it is \"green\". It can be seen that there is a sharp decline in compressive strength from a ratio of .34 (34 parts water to 100 powder, or about 1 part water to 3 parts powder) to .36 and above. This is not to say that a .34 ratio is the optimal or best ratio, merely that, within the constraints of Mr. Carter's test, that ratio showed the highest strength after mold dehydration and cooling. One could infer that the mold material would have a similar compressive strength in the high-end soak of the firing schedule, and that may not be the most dangerous assumption. But unless the assumption is tested, it remains exactly that.One thing that struck me in reading Carter's paper was the lack of defects in the castings regardless of the w/p ratio. Carter surmised that this was due to the robust nature of the R&R premium investment. To confirm this, he then used a \"non-premium brand of investment\" (presumably a competitors). The molds held up \"for the most part\" (Carter downplaying the fact that the non-premium brand worked just as well?). The results are not entirely clear cut. It seems that w/p ratios may not be as important as suggested, and that the investment, regardless of the brand, is fairly forgiving, and can withstand \"some mishandling\". I would suggest that further tests be done on this metric.Of course the use of the compressive strength metric in making investment forms doesn't provide any great insight. We are much more interested in the tensile strength of the material. Very few materials have similar compressive and tensile strength profiles, and certainly gypsum does not. But compressive strength is much more easily and consistently measured, and so, I suppose we must make do with this measure, but we should recognize the lack of utility in using it. For example, let's say I wish to calculate the hydrostatic pressure to determine mold failure. Actually, since this is glass, the measure would be vitreostatic pressure, but anyways... Let's say, for convenience, that the \"fired\" crush strength of my mold material is 50 psi. That is considered pretty weak. How much glass can I pile on top of it before it breaks? Well, hydrostatic - or vitreostatic - pressure is calculated simply by density x gravity x height. Better still, specific weight has density and gravity terms in it already, so pressure = specific weight x height. The specific weight of water is 1 gm / centimeter cubed. Most soda-lime glasses are around 2.5 times the specific weight of water, so let's use that number: 2.5 gm per centimeter cubed. Converting to pounds per cubic foot, and then to cubic inches, gives me the specific weight of glass = .09 psi. So we simply multiply that term by height in inches. A casting 8 inches in height will exert .72 psi on the mold surface. That's not much. How much glass do I have to pile up to crush my mold? Well, 50 / .09 = 555.55 inches = around 46 feet of glass! That sounds ridiculous. I'd better double check. Okay, the water pressure at the deepest part of the ocean is around 16,000 psi. That's with seven miles of water on top. 7 miles x 5280 feet x 12 inches = 443,520 inches. 16,000 / 443,520 inches gives me .036 psi for water, times 2.5 is .09 psi for glass, so yeah, the calculation is correct - but it still sounds ridiculous. The compressive strength as a useful metric for investment stength is practically useless. What about tensile strength? There are varying reports of tensile strength for gypsum investments, ranging from 1/6 to 1/15th the compressive strength of the material. This will vary according to the thickness of the material and the amount of flexure. Perhaps it is easier to calculate the pressure upon the sides of a form. Lets take 50 lbs of glass in the form of a cube. A cube of 50 lbs of glass is a little over 8 inches on a side, but for convenience sake, we shall use 8 inches. Vertical pressure upon the bottom of the mold is easy to calculate, but pressure on the side is a bit more complicated. Pascal's Law tells us that pressure is equivalent in all directions. Thus, at the top of the mold, the first inch of glass will press upon the side at .09 lbs /square inch, but this pressure progresses linearly until at the bottom of the mold, the glass presses upon the side at .72 lbs / square inch. This is known as a pressure prism, and we would have to integrate over the surface area of the side to get the total pressure. Fortunately, basic mechanics provides a straightforward formula for a vertical rectangle in the form of specific weight * midpoint of the side * area of the side = .09 psi * 4 inches * (8 inches) squared = 22.94 lbs of pressure. That's not much at all. If I assume (and this is just a rank and totally unsupported assumption) that tensile strength increases linearly with thickness, and say, a quarter inch of investment, possessed of 60 psi crush strength, has a tensile strength 1/15th that value (i.e. tensile strength is 4 psi), then the mold wall thickness should be about 1 and 1/2 inches to overcome side pressure at the bottom of the mold. Doesn't mean anything really, but I suspect we are all making our molds much, much thicker than they actually need to be.The addition of other materials to create an investment composite is well known. The addition of the metal reinforcements, such as steel wire, hardware cloth, chicken wire, etc. have been used. Personally, I find they rarely add any strength to the investment. Given the relatively extreme kiln temperatures and oxidation that they undergo, metals soften and weaken very quickly. The addition of refractory materials, such as coarse ground mullite, perlite, etc., again, from a personal standpoint, add nothing to the strength of the investment. True, mullite will form long needle-like crystals similar to gypsum, but only when ground to a fine particle size, and formation occurs only above around 1000C (1832F). The one material which would seem to increase tensile strength is fiberglass or ceramic fiber. Fiberglass has been known since ancient Egyptian times, where it was used as reinforcement for ceramic vessels. The \"modern\" manufacture of fiberglass dates back to 1830s France. The use of fiberglass has been rediscovered again and again by many people, and has been used to reinforce plaster architectural elements since at least the late 1960s-early 70s. Fiberglass strand is, pound for pound, approximately six to ten times as strong as steel wire (depending upon the type). Given its extensive use in the construction industries, the physical properties of glass reinforced gypsum are quite well known. The flexural strength is around 3200-4000 psi, and the tensile strength is around 1200-1400 psi. However, one must be careful to use the right type of fiberglass. The most common fiberglass, E-glass, has a softening point reported around 846C (1555F). S-glass, used in aerospace/military/marine composite materials, has a softening point of around 1055C (1932F). Anyone who has reported success with a fiberglass reinforced shell investment under glass casting temperatures has - wittingly or unwittingly - been using S-glass.Given the relatively extreme strength of this composite material, compared to traditional gypsum-based investments, very thin investment shells are theoretically possible. However, in practical use, unless the fiberglass is embedded woven and whole within the gypsum investment, no appreciable increase in tensile strength is observed. This is due to the fact that the investment bond between fiberglass strands remains weak. It appears the \"old masters\" using thick and unmodified gypsum-base block molds, knew what they were doing..."},

I believe the term my father used for him was \"asshole\". Given that my father cursed about maybe once a year (and, yes, my frequent use of profanity is my form of rebellion), that was a pretty telling condemnation. Also, his kids turned out to be rotten shits as well,so...Anyway, the guy had no control over his dog, an empty-headed Irish setter named \"Colleen\". He kept her in a large cage, completely covered by fence wire. I figured out Colleen had gotten out when I looked out the window, and saw a pack of of around a dozen dogs out on the street. Colleen was in heat.I went out and shooed the dogs away (surprised now that, though many growled and bared their teeth, none of them took a snap at me, and instead cowered when I raised a hand to cuff them - apparently the brutish inhabitants of the 1960s kept their dogs well-beaten), and went to grab Colleen to take her home. She had no collar on, so I had to grab her by the scruff her neck, and that's when I found that she was completely covered in dog semen.Well, it's one of those semi-rural moments, like stepping barefoot into chicken shit, when you get grossed out, but there's nothing to be done about it, and you are already committed, so... it's not like you are gonna die from it.So, to use the above as a metaphor for the 2012 Republican primaries, who is what? Is Colleen, the bitch in heat, the Republican voter? Or are the ardent suitors? I kind of view the bitch in heat as the Republican voter, but an empty-headed Irish setter bitch in heat kind of Republican voter. In which case the candidates are just these frenetic humpers that can seem to find an entry, and so just coat the voter in dog jism. Except Newt Gingrich. I can't imagine him as part of the pack. More like, the soft-served swirl of doggie doo left after the frenzied fuck mêlée.But Romney, Santorum, Paul? Even Paul is not trying very hard. So, I guess it's just Romney's and Santorum splash-coating the voter's fur.There is a certain paranoid frenzy to all this. Jonathan Chait chalks it up to a cold realization on the part of Republicans that the population is getting away from them, that the demographics are leaving them all behind. And so, rather than compromise and watch their position steadily weaken, they have decided to make a last stand, and try and jerk the nation as far to the right as they can. Maybe. Certainly the strategy of sabotage that has been carried out over the past four years has not left them in good stead with the voters. But only if it is a strategy, rather than just a tactic, a temporary rearguard action.Smart money (as well as the planners and PR flipperlimbs) says that the Republicans give this round to Obama, and let him have the second term. They always have Rubio in 2016. Yeah. Well...By then, they may have rubbed most of the dog sperm off of their hides."},

{"title": "The Lost Colony of Texas", "date": "Friday, March 9, 2012", "text": "How to describe the span of 13,000 years in as many sentences, let alone a few paragraphs? It's an inhuman span of time, outside the realm of ordinary experience. There is no hook on which to hang a hat, so perhaps the best thing to do is describe those things that can survive so long: stones, stories, and people.On the lost world of Texas, stones - and shards of pottery - can be found engraved with English words and letters. In \"present day\" Texas no one, not even scholars of ancient languages, can read them. For such is the constant mutability of language that even after a few centuries, someone using the South Midland dialect of North America circa 2010CE would be speaking gibberish - incomprehensible, but strangely disturbing in its familiarity. Stories, oral traditions, have a surprising stability. The best known example on old Earth are the folk tales of Australian aborigines, separated from the rest of humanity for perhaps 45,000 years, four times as long as Texans. And Texans have their folk tales. There seem to be two branched origin tales. Both share the idea that Texans are not of their world, that they originally came from the stars.The first set of myths and legends has it that the ancestors of Texans were gods up in the heavens, who over time bred and had children. But the offspring of the gods were weak and deformed, ugly and mortal. The gods, not being brutal, could not kill them, and so they left them there upon the earth, abandoned like a box of kittens on the side of a country road to fend as best they could.The second set of myths has it that the ancestors of Texans were gods up in the heavens, who crafted the Texans out of mud and clay, and breathed a life and a soul into them. At first, the gods doted upon their children, and granted them their every fondest desire. But over time, the children became unruly, surly and ungrateful, and so the gods cast them down out of heaven, down to earth to fend for themselves.Ethnologists who have studied both sets have surmised that the second set is based upon an older, more primitive narrative, as what archeological evidence that can be found does not support this conjecture.(But imagine the surprise of archaeologists who, once the full scale colonization of their Moon was underway, having discovered the stash of records, technology, and mummified remains of the very first generation of wormhole pioneers, the determination that the very atoms of those ancestral mummies could not have originated in the Texan solar system). What is common within the culture is the sense of abandonment, and an equal sense of resentment, and, paradoxically, pride in any technical accomplishment. Pride being the foremost characteristic of all folk tales. Humility is little found within the planetary culture, yet empty pretense is one of the foremost characteristics to poke fun at.The concepts behind \"All hat and no cattle\" may be meaningless to the contemporary Texan, yet, if explain, he would readily embrace the phrase.As to the contemporary Texan, viewed as a solitary individual, one who would have to say not uncomely, handsome in a rough and raggedy way, of large stature, robust, even beefy, but still retaining a surprising litheness.This might be explain by both culture and environment. A love of strenuous activity and physical challenge is encouraged. And the native species of planet Texas do tend to be on the large side. The species analog of the wolf, for example, is the size of a lion. A lion as large as a grizzly bear. Bears are as large as rhinoceros. Bison as large as elephants. And elephants (or rather, mastodon, since the planet is a tad on the chilly side) as large as, well, mastodon. But that's big enough.Albert Einstein tells us that my Now is not the same as your Now. We who inhabit the middles of things, in ordinary space, at casual walking velocities, at room temperatures, see things more like Sir Isaac Newton, who saw space and time as vast stage on which matter and energy played things out. His Now was the same Now as shared by everyone on that stage. Now, we know, not only is the same Now not shared within Einstein's relativistic frame of reference, but across the vast distances of the universe, with the indeterminancy of quantum mechanics, the passage of Nows varies. So, when you open a wormhole throat, the Now at the other end may be close to your Now, or a million years ahead or behind your now. For the fifty million people from Texas and its surrounds, who jumped through that wormhole, their Now got set back 13,000 years behind ours. This would be deeply troubling to Einstein, as it violates causality. But since this happens only through a wormhole, and this is expected, there's not much to be done about it.Suffice to say, for the people of the new world of Texas, stranded some 60 million light years distant, some 13,000 years in the past, with perhaps the bare minimum seed corn needed to sustain a 21st century technology, and perhaps a billion person support shortfall, a Fall was inevitable. A series of tumbles at the very least. Fortunately, the level of technology on Texas never fell much past 1830s America. And, after a series of stumbles, but with a population growth at the biological maximum, with a culture fostering a healthy curiosity, they'd only five thousand years of relative barbarity to account for in Texan history. That left a good eight thousand years forward progress from a late 20th century level of technology.You can imagine what happened. Peering through a peranoscope at Earth's own history, you find an average of about four thousand years to go from smelting iron to interstellar travel. Look through a similar peranoscope at the history of Texas - avoiding the usual Divergences involving nuclear armageddon, comet strikes, pandemics, etc. -  the Texans did okay.  Rediscovering wormhole technologies, and doing Earth one better in coming up with a better than breakeven fusion technology (!), the Texans went on to colonize their whole galaxy. And as they worked their way up the technological plateau, heading further and further into our star-spanning, world-taming, cybernetic, mechanized, interconnected, informed, and hive-brained future, they still remained stubbornly human.If what they went through in those five thousand years of our future could be called the Singularity, then it is interesting how they came out pretty much the same as when they went in."},
{"title": "The Game of Monopoly", "date": "Thursday, March 8, 2012", "text": "I've often wondered if there wasn't just a little subversive anti-capitalism woven into the game of Monopoly. If you look at the history of it's origins, it sure looks like it was set up to teach the lesson of how capitalism sucks for most everyone except for the privileged few, enriched by the many.Why, even the railroad names seem to be chosen to reflect the enemies of the proletarian struggle for equality, during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. These railroads, the Pennsylvania, the Reading, the B&O, all were some of the worst examples of corporate excess, graft, and the most vile labor practices that made the 1870s such a great time to be a working class hero.The game of Monopoly repeatedly provides the lesson that initially equal agents, through a process of land owning and rent seeking, combined with chance, results in the concentration of wealth into the hands of the few. In fact, I'd say one would be hard pressed to design a simpler set of game rules to demonstrate this seeming near-physical-law of inevitable social and economic inequity.Well, a few physical studies have suggested that most wealth exchange rules inevitably result in wealth concentration, but that not all wealth exchange rules necessarily result in this.The authors of this study constructed a model borrowing statistical methods used in Boltzmann's studies of kinetic energy exchanges of gas molecules during collisions. This seems to me a model perfectly suited socioeconomic conditions.\"They found that over time, all the available wealth is concentrated among only a few agents. This is represented by a tail-shaped graph that confirms previous studies showing that wealth distribution follows a power law. As a result, the free market is stalled with no subsequent possible exchanges of wealth, even if wealth were distributed evenly from the start.\"Sound familiar? As in inevitable slowdown of the economy once wealth is sequestered out of general circulation? Let me get back to this. The chance part, studies have found that:\"researchers simulated the performance of a large number of investors who started out with equal amounts of capital and who realized returns annually over a number of years. But wealth did not remain equal, because each year an entrepreneur's return was a random draw taken from a pool of possible return rates. Thus, a high return did not guarantee continuing high returns, nor did early low returns mean continuing bad luck. Even though all investors had an equal chance of success, the simulations consistently resulted in dramatic concentration of wealth over time. The reason: With compounding capital returns, some individuals will have a string of high returns and, given enough time, will accumulate an overwhelming share of the wealth\".In short, they got lucky, as in if you so rich, why ain't you smart. Or, as my Norse ancestors used to say \"Better to be lucky than smart\".So, if it is pretty much the luck of the draw, and when you play the game, the rules (which, by the way, are artificially derived by society at large, or by some privileged portion thereof), need to be carefully chosen. The authors of the first study cited suggest:\"regulations for the rules of wealth exchange are necessary to avoid concentration of wealth and stalling of market exchange. For example, systems in which regulations and taxes give the poorest agent a probability of wealth gain of over 50 percent may prevent wealth concentration and decrease inequalities. Also, the possibility of gains exceeding their own capital is crucial to permit a recovery of the poorer agents and to circumvent market stagnancy.\"Or maybe something more than Monopoly's flat tax, applied each turn? That would be an interesting game.Then, of course, a similar game, Risk, the game of world conquest, operates along similar lines of simulation as Monopoly. Maybe a mashup is in order to get to the geopolitical consequences.Because, with a hotel on Kamchatka, you'd be less likely to start a land war in Asia."},
{"title": "The Convergence", "date": "Wednesday, March 7, 2012", "text": "I guess it's only a matter of time before I end up writing a piece of fiction here. I've been threatening it through the BOAPW (Best of All Possible Worlds) pieces that I've been playing with.And yes, that is the purpose of fiction, Uncle John. Play.So, it may be like watching sausage making, this gruesome blundering of mine as a poor substitute for worldbuilding. There have been inept attempts at producing some kind of science fiction world, some abortive. Some mutagenic. Still, this thinking out loud that I've done, through these essays, I think I'm getting close. I'm starting to realize what aspects of this world I wish to construct are worth pursuing, and what other aspects are superfluous, or not particularly enticing. Those who are sticking with this prose exploration, I apologize, although I'm starting to think that any fiction that comes out of this is going to have fan base of perhaps one. Me.What the hell, maybe it's all just catharsis anyway.But I am at a point where my universe is starting to come together. And 'universe', first of all, is the most important operative concept in this sordid little drama I'm working on. As in, the whole damn, as in \"make no small plans\", as in, big enough to insure that the most outrageous things are possible within it. Am I making it too easy on myself? Or could it be I'm building entirely too big of a house to ever furnish properly?Possibly.But that's the most important component. The possible. And the best of all possible. Let's start with that particularly awkward acronym. It's a worthwhile turn of phrase, owing everything to the novella Candide, which I've never read. But, that story, penned by François-Marie Arouet Voltaire, savaging, albeit in a playful manner, Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz as the character Doctor Pangloss, is where I am getting that operative slogan: \"All is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\".And yes, I tire of the BOAPW acronym, and now give it a new name, The Convergence. (Which, by the way, I'm trying to do blogger maintenance and go back and label all the commonly themed essays with the label 'The Convergence').I call this fictive universe the Convergence for the same reason one speaks of a convergence in mathematics, and specifically, using infinite series. Bear with me here for a second, and let me see if I can explain my chosen nomenclature.Let's say I take a series of numbers, and add them up, and that series continues all the way out to infinity. For example, the series 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... is added up in an infinite series 0+1=1, then 1+2=3, then 3+3=6, then 6+4=10, then 10+5=15, etc. all the way out to infinity. The answer of this series, summed up, is infinity. And in mathematics, this is called a divergent series.Are there number series that don't add up to infinity? Are there series that converge to a limit, that are convergent? Consider the halving fractions, the geometric progression: 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32,... and when you add up the series, you get, 1+1/2= 3/2, then 3/2+1/4=7/4, then 7/4+1/8=15/8, then 15/8+1/16=31/16, then 31/16+1/32=63/32... So it looks like the series can be added up to 1/infinity and never quite get to 2! And that's what happens.It turns out there are all sorts of infinite series like this, that will converge to some number, even though they have an infinite number of terms to add up. And I borrow this concept for those possible worlds, within all possible worlds, where we, as a species, survive. Since we, as a species, survive, this the best of all possible worlds. (What is so important about we, as a species, surviving? Well, I'm in the stories. It's about me, right? So it's probably best that humanity get to tag along as well). As it turns out, in my pretend world, all those possible worlds where we survive, big picture and long term, eventually converge to that one world, thus termed The Convergence.(And yes, I know the unfortunate tendency in science fiction to whup out the capitalization for important shit, and I will try to keep it to a minimum).So, all of those worlds where we don't make it? Those are called Divergences.What else? How is this all known? I took a shot at it in the essay \"2050CE: A Fable\". And in that particular parallel universe, wherein Mark Everett, son of Hugh Everett III, is not a mathematically challenged rock and roll star, and wherein Hugh Everett III, PhD, has produced a coherent set of equations that allow for the empirical and theoretical exploration of parallel worlds. These are discovered in the basement of the family home, and are called, appropriately enough, The Basement Equations.And they allow for, among other technological marvels, such as wormholes (once, of course, the materials science and ancillary technologies are up to speed), the construction of the Peranoscope.Google tells me this word does not exist. Google suggests \"panoscope\" or \"pianoscope\". Hmm. I kind of like pianoscope, but no.Kurman has created a neologism! I construct this word, from the Greek peran-, an apparently accusative case of an obsolete derivative of the word piero  \"to pierce\", meaning \"beyond, over, across, on the other side, farther side\", and scope (like microscope, or telescope). And the peranoscope (though important, I don't think it needs constant capitalization) is a device that allows one to see all possible outcomes to an action. A PeranoscopeIt shows you what happens if you had chosen heads instead tails, gone left instead of right, or even that you could not have gone left, but only right. And with the peranoscope, one can find one's way into that world known as the Convergence.Is this enough masturbation for one essay? I think so. The hard part is, you know, actually writing a story to inhabit this worldbuilding exercise.Oh, wait, what about those aliens? The Kraken? Comic relief, maybe? I've a feeling this story will need a light touch, ala Stanislaw Lem (big, big fucking fan, RIP).Oh, and what about those abandoned Texans? The ones thrown millions of light years from Earth, and thousands of years into the past, feeling maybe a little resentful and orphaned? Well, I don't want to get the story line too complicated, but they are there just in case I need to write a space opera, with cattle. I mean, who better to chew up the scenery in florid melodrama then our friends from down Texas way, now, uh, out Fornax way?"},
{"title": "The Failure of Fantasy Revisited", "date": "Tuesday, March 6, 2012", "text": "Castle Of Sin by Frank FrazettaSome time ago, I wrote an essay surrounding the literary tradition of fantasy. Upon rereading that essay, I wish now to recant many of what now seem parochial and limited opinions of that genre.(I will, however, reproduce the one worthwhile attribute of that essay, a painting by the late and great Frank Frazetta, depicting some spectacularly well-muscled feminine pulchritude).My greatest crime against fantasy was the contention that science fiction was socially relevant, that fantasy, as only an escapist vehicle depicting simpler times, or, as I said a \"jerk-off fantasy about medieval romanticism.I regret that remark. There are forms of fantasy, I believe now called \"urban\" or \"modern\" that are devoted to exploring social themes, and in some ways not permissible to science fiction (or at least the \"hard\" variety).What changed my mind? I think the course correction was two-fold. The first, though only a trigger, was picking up the Vernor Vinge's new book \"Children of the Sky\" from the library. The book itself, so far engaging, was not the real impetus, but a trigger, in that it made me go back and reread Vinge's 1993 essay on the Singularity. This essay was intended as informed speculation, though I think Vinge still believes that a technological leap towards a transcendent superhumanity still lies in our future. As to whether that future is all happily-ever-aftering, or something more less than perfect, the point is that future becomes opaque. All conjecture becomes pointless. All bets are off.But within the context of literature, of world-building, Vinge, I think, rather than setting up a barricade, threw down a gauntlet.\"All of your ideas about the future, the posthuman or superhuman future, are based upon historical trends\", Vinge seems to say,\"and thus, your futures of galactic exploration utilizing the metaphor of the age of sail, or of a machine intelligence using cogs and steam are as ludicrous as they sound. Imagine better! Make it fucking awesome! Make it... psychedelic!\"In other words, stories set for the far, far future, which typically allowed for more phantasmic elements, were now allowed for advanced technologies.Which brings the second vector component of my course correction, Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law:\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"I interpret Clarke's statement in two ways, or rather, suspect he interpreted it in two ways. The first being that in terms of future predictions, one can afford to be a little crazy, provided that there is some method of grounding the miraculous technology with in the known laws of physics. (And my take there is, for example, it's probably a good thing, good in scare quotes, that humanity can build H-bombs, in that it means we have a pretty good handle on the known laws of physics. I have covered some of the physical limitations that technology must recognize, but these limits in no way preclude some pretty amazingly magical shit in our speculative future). The second being that, in that clever and classic British no-nonsense pragmatism, Clarke suggests there's a logical explanation behind all the hocus-pocus, and we are not savages or scared little children to be frightened of ghosties and goblins and things that bump in the night. In other words, regardless of the usual sense of awe and wonder that the so-called supernatural evokes in us, it is no less (or does not compare to) the awe and wonder of the natural world. In other words, the actual explanation, prosaic to some, actually turns out to be even more bizarre and spectacular than the mystical mumbo-jumbo bullshit.What's my point here? I guess it's that, Vinge's literary notions of the Singularity, rather than limit the number and kind of stories to tell, actually liberates us into a whole new realm of fantasy."},
{"title": "The Empire of Dixie", "date": "Thursday, March 1, 2012", "text": "I came home to a message on my answering machine from my doctor. I had a yearly physical last week, and I had blood tests done (even though my shit insurance will not pay for it - sound familiar?), and the doctor left the following message:\"John , this is Doctor ______. We found some abnormalities in your blood tests. I'd like you to call me today or tomorrow afternoon to discuss this\".He pulls this shit with me every year. Of course there are abnormalities. I eat badly, don't drink enough water, and besides that, I'm Scandinavian. And let tell you, 2100 generations of serious inbreeding can really fuck up your blood chemistry. So, I've got to assume it's usual medical bitching, but in case it actually is serious, then I need something to distract me, so....Astronomers can \"see\" out to the cosmic horizon some 42 billion light years.  Using this number as the radius for a spherical volume, and applying the formula for such (4/3 * π * r3), and doing a small amount of arithmetic reveals that the observable universe contains some 310 x 1028 cubic light years, or if you like really big numbers, 630 x 1066 cubic miles.And that's mostly empty space. If we are very generous, and assume, say, an average of a million earthlike worlds per galaxy, give all the observable universe some one hundred trillion galaxies, then there are some 1018 habitable worlds in the universe, which, if they were all uniformly distributed, gives you a habitation density of some 1 / 1048, and that is one in a quindecillion. And that is a very, very tiny number indeed.I don't think there is any comparable ratio to this tiny number, but it really doesn't matter, because it turns out that - and I know this for a fact - that there are only nineteen earthlike worlds in the whole observable universe.Just nineteen.That's only nineteen worlds that humanity could be living on and not notice too much of a difference from living on the Earth. You know, blue skies, green grass, trees, sandy beaches, stuff like that. The animals only slightly different, but not enough to be alarming.You'd think it would be a lot higher number, but no. And apparently it has something to do with ours being a double planet. And through an accident of history, one of those worlds is called Texas. And that world is the center of a space opera empire spanning a whole galaxy group, and that empire is known as The Empire of Dixie.How'd that happen? Well, one of the first wormhole throats ever constructed was down in Houston, TX --- naturally. It was built inside the Harris County Domed Stadium, oh, sorry, the Reliant Astrodome, no, fuck it, the Houston Astrodome, after it was annexed by the Johnson Space Center --- naturally.I guess a description is in order. At the former fifty yard line is an airtight sphere contained in a chiral two-layer geodesic metal skeleton some 150 feet in diameter. Up in the stands surrounding the inner dome, where countless baseball, football, and professional wrestling fans used to sit, is the world's thirty-fifth largest standing army, bristling with everything from futuristic railguns down to M-4 combat assault rifles, all pointed at that sphere. And inside the geodesic sphere is a smaller concentric spherical structure, consisting of tiered stainless steel catwalks, struts, trusses, ranks and ranks of boxes filled with exotic matter and  transmaterial generators (used to generate, you know, wormholes), even more ranks of banks of electromagnets,  particle accelerator tracks wound throughout like a giant ball of yarn, cables, stanchions, hoses, pumps, sensors of every kind and description, wires, yellow hazard signs, and throughout, like a swarm of fire ants, essential ground personnel suited up in space suits - every single one of them deemed expendable.And then, within of all of that, on a day when the wormhole throat is open, everything is bathed in a Cherenkov glow, blue to violet radiation emanating from a shimmering soap bubble, some thirty to seventy feet across, that hovers above the ground. Soap bubble? More like a big crystal ball, with strange shifting visual aberrations at the edges, which give me a headache when I look at them, and if you can handle staring into the center, some other fucking place entirely. Weird!Well, funny thing about wormholes - aside from the fact that they are hard to aim and the destination throat won't sit still - is that they open up through space and time. You know, spacetime?So, sometimes that target throat is a billion light years away and a day ahead, and then a billion light years plus or minus a mile and a millennium, or a microsecond and fourteen billion light years off. And then you open it up again to the same coordinates, and - nothing. Not even close to the last time and place.And the people that went there? Lost forever in space and time, for all we can tell. Oh, they are out there someplace, somewhere, somewhen. You just can't seem to get back to them, not with the perverse vagaries of an uncertain universe surrounding us.So, when the first wormhole was created, and what do you know? that wormhole throat opened up within the solar neighborhood of one of those nineteen worlds. And a fantastically gorgeous blue world it was, with a striking golden moon.Within a month practically the whole of state of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, then Mississippi, Alabama.... practically the whole of Dixieland had jumped on through and good riddance to old Earth. Keeping the aperture open taxed the ERCOT power grid to the point they finally had to close it down.Some two months later, the grid beefed up,  hordes of potential colonists camping out throughout the greater Houston area, the wormhole was opened up again and - nothing. No world. No star. A completely different region of the universe presented itself, despite the best efforts of the theoretical physicists to target the original coordinates. Some fifty million people simply gone, lost out there in the universe someplace - a complete mystery.The Kraken - naturally - solved the mystery. Soon after first contact, they mentioned an interstellar civilization of \"you monkeys\" occupied a galaxy some 60 million light years distant, out in the Fornax cluster. Turns out that was the world we had sent them to - only they arrived there some 13,000 years in the past, according to our calendar. The Kraken advised us to maybe steer clear of that region of space for awhile, at least until Earth had worked its way a bit higher up the slope of the technological plateau.But the Kraken did show us a video of that lost homeworld. Still blue and gorgeous, and with the night side ablaze with city lights. And a large sublight dreadnought can be seen warping up from the planet to interdict the Kraken ship.And the golden moon? In waning gibbous phase from the point of view of the video. But on the darkened side of that moon, looking for all the world like a neon sign in a diner window:\"Welcome to Texas\"."},
{"title": "What is Money?", "date": "Wednesday, February 29, 2012", "text": "Some of the more academic chatterbox parts of the intertubes have been abuzz over Peter Graeber's 2011 book \"Debt: The First 5,000 Years\". I'm still waiting for this book to be returned to the library, so I can read it, but since everyone is talking about it now, the spoilers are out.And the main gist I will take from John Quiggin's rumination about money. I enjoy Quiggin. Don't always understand him, but I enjoy him. My comment might flummox him some, as one of his goals is to make things understandable.In any case, here's what I gather from what he gathers about the book:\"Graeber shows, convincingly enough for me, that the story conventionally told by economists, in which money emerges as a replacement for barter systems, is nonsense. In fact, as he notes this point has been made by anthropologists many times and ignored just as often.  Thanks to the marvels of auto-googling, I’ve been aware for some time that my namesake, Alison Hingston Quiggin gave the definitive demonstration long ago in her ‘Survey of Primitive Money’. Graeber sharpens the point by arguing that the real source of money is as a way of specifying debts\".So, the usual definition of money as a medium of exchange, an abstracted symbol representing an exchange of material goods or commodities, is wrong. Instead, since money was, according to Graeber, created to keep track of irredeemable debt between entities both solitary and aggregated, per Quiggin:\"From now on, we can treat money primarily as a store of value, and stop worrying about how it works as a medium of exchange\". I'll get back to why I emboldened and italicized that phrase in a moment. In another region of the intertubes, one in which many, many people were asked and answered the question \"What is money?\", I answered with the following:\"Money is what I shall gladly do for you on Tuesday, for a hamburger today.\" Meaning, of course, that I already recognize the debt portion that Graeber wants to talk about, and also the irredeemable portion as well. That's the whole frickin' point of debt, it is a promissory transaction.For, anyone who knows the tale of Wimpy, Tuesday will never come. Let's be clear though. This is not to Wimpy gets a free lunch. He sometimes does. Sometimes he doesn't. But when he does gladly pay on Tuesday, the payment he makes for the value of the hamburger will always be less than the hamburger. What is meant is that, in all transactions, there is always an inequity. Forget all changes wrought through the internal contradictions of capitalism, the psychological warfare of mercantilism, the other weird tribal customs and superstitions surrounding social orders, the fact is, through physical scarcity or plenty, through chance and contingency, through entropy at the very least, the winding down of the universal clock itself, the value of an object, from moment to moment, will never, ever be the same.(To throw in a dig at the ridiculous libertarians: The whole egalitarian and idealistic notion that libertarians espouse \"No force or fraud\" is physically impossible. Barter is, by its very nature, inequity. Profit is just another name for \"force and fraud\").Getting back to that emboldened italicized phrase. Value is not classical physics. It contains no clock parts. It is not a Newtonian transaction. It cannot be connected by strings and wooden rods. The value of something is neither continuous nor continuously changing.Consider: right at this very moment, I hold a lump of gold in my hand. I do.It is a knuckle bone sized lump that I took out of the jewelry instructor's cabinet. (I do this from time to time, because I like the feel and heft of it, and then I put it back). This lump of inert material, probably microscopically changing as little atoms rub off onto my skin, and perhaps the occasional radioactive decay turns a rare atom of gold into iridium, but still and all it sits pretty much the same lump from human-sized moment to moment. And yet the value of the gold lump is jittering and chittering up and down and sideways like a crazy wavicle with each quote on the spot market, and nowadays, with computers, at lightning speed. Value is spooky action at a distance. Value is quantum entanglement. Value is an absolute value of an amplitude representing a probability. And money? Nothing more than the decohrence of an entangled state.If entanglement is grace, then money is it's fall."},
{"title": "Completely slipped my mind -", "date": "Tuesday, February 28, 2012", "text": "- I broke up a fight at the college this past Friday. Actually I prevented a fight. Probably.I was done for the day, dropping off my timesheet at the admin building. There is a designated smoking area in a covered walkway outside of the entrance. I heard shouting as I approached, and coming around the corner, two heavyset kids engaged in a shoving and shouting match. A smoker crowd stood in the background away from them, and a small slight kid, with his eyes to the ground, was attempting to intervene, saying \"Calm. Calm\".They were both dressed, actually they were all dressed, in what I am told is a now a years out-of-date gothic/punker garb, with metal studs and chains hanging on their pants and shirts. Kind of like what is pictured here, but not quite.Both kids were getting louder, and the shoves more forceful, and so, as an employee of the college, and, wow, an official adult I guess, I had to intervene. I remember feeling very tired and put upon to have to do this bullshit, and sighing to myself \"oh for christsake\". But in any case, I mustered up my best drill sergeant voice, and said, with just the right volume, loud enough to startle, \"HEY!\".That broke the spell on them. So I glared really intensely at them, the way I'm really good at, the way that I'm told scares most people, and followed it up with a \"...don't you boys have a class to go to?\"They both instantly kind of slumped, and started whining at me about how it was his (the other guys) fault, so I ended the whole scene with a very tired, almost Nick Nolte kind of growled \"Get the fuck outta here!\"And they did.And then I went into the building just in time to watch Security hustling towards me. A kid and an older guy in uniforms, and the old guy has a holster on him. I think the only campus cop allowed to carry. The altercation must have went on long enough that someone called it in.I said \"Are you guys looking for the fight?\"\"Yeah!\"\"It's over with. I broke it up\".\"Oh\" and then, once that sunk in, \"Oh sir. No. No. You let us handle that next time\".I waved my hand in invitation, \"Me casa es su casa\" I replied, getting a puzzled look in turn.I invoke Rodney King quote, \"Can't we all just get along?\"And the answer is, \"When you compare us to the other Great Apes, Rodney? We are pretty fucking calm\".If chimps could use guns, they'd have wiped themselves out a million years ago.So, despite appearances to the contrary, we actually do get along pretty damn well."},
{"title": "\"We Meant Well\": A Book Report", "date": "Monday, February 27, 2012", "text": "\"We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People\" by Peter Van Buren. This book is part of a book series available through the American Empire Project. \"Better an Archduchess should be fucked than the monarchy\". This summation of Habsburg diplomacy was uttered after Napoleon Bonaparte was married to Marie Louise, daughter of Francis I, Emperor of Austria. Substitute \"Iraq\" for \"Archduchess\" and \"the American Empire\" for \"the monarchy\", and you have an equal summation of the subject matter of this book, which I recommend to you.When I first acquired this book from the library (and actually, not my first choice, but \"Debt: The First 5,000 Years\" by David Graeber is not due back until the 21st of March), the book had two dog-eared pages in it. When I finished reading, it had succumbed to eighteen more folded corners. I cannot possibly include all the quotations I would wish to include, so again, the best thing to do is read the book.At a personal level, when a person endures suffering and privation, it is a hard enough portrait to experience. Multiplied by the millions, taken to the national level, it overloads our capacity to think and to feel. And so, we shut down our humanity, academize the pain, squalor and indignities into tidy geopolitical issues. This book attempts to strip away these tawdry and dishonest decorations, and attempt to provide a narrative of just how bad it can be. The treatment the people of Iraq underwent, at the hands of the US State Department is and was, for the most part, criminally incompetent. The author uses the term \"disresponsible\", a step beyond irresponsible, as in \"should have taken the responsibility, but shucked it off. Oh, not all the blame can be laid at the feet of the risibly clueless professional caste of the elite American diplomatic 1% corps. Plenty of blame is there to be spread, in turn, down the line, through the parasitic contractor companies, to the level of the corrupt local sheiks and thugs.This is not to say that reading this book is one long bummer, although there are some chapters that are so goddamn depressing as to make it an act of will to read to the end. The book is darkly funny, as in any building exercise, where the attempt is made to mold the vanquished in the image of the victor, the road to hell, paved with taxpayer dollars, cannot help but occasionally be deeply darkly funny. And van Buren is up to the task of finding those few elements of cynical humor, with choice bits well-represented by all four corners of Hippocratic humours: blood, phlegm, black, and yellow bile in just the right proportions.  Starting, of course, with the book title. No wry observation, when it comes to competency, could be more devastating than the term \"We Meant Well\". Anyone who has ever worked in an organization larger than Dunbar's Number, be it a multi-national corporation, large religious orders, or the Austro-Hungrarian Empire, will feel right at home in this book.\"In addition to the $63 billion Congress had handed us for Iraq's reconstruction, we also had some $91 billion of captured Iraqi funds (that were mostly misplaced by Coalition Provisional Authority), plus another $18 billion donated by countries like Japan and South Korea. In 2009, we had another $387 million for aid to internal refugees that piad for many reconstruction-like projects. If that was not enough, over a billion additional US dollars were spent on operating costs for the Provisional Reconstruction Teams. By comparison, the reconstruction of Germany and Japan cost, in 2010 dollars, only $32 billion and $17 billion respectively\".Despite two decades of forced privation and occasional bombings on the parts of the Bush 1 and Clinton administrations, despite the corrupt and criminal rule of Saddam and his spawn, prior to the Bush 2 invasion, unemployment numbers were estimated at around 30%, average number of slum dwellers under Saddam totaled around 20%. In 2010, unemployment numbers were at least 50%, the United Nations in 2009 estimated 57% of all Iraqis lived in slums.I conclude, not my usual style, with a jacket blurb from someone I respect. \"Long after the self-serving memoirs of people named Bush, Rice, and Rumsfeld are consigned to some landfill, this unsparing and very funny chronicle will remain on the short list of books essential to understanding America's Iraq War. Here is nation buidling as it looks from the inside - waste, folly, and sheer silliness included\" - Andrew J. Bacevich"},
{"title": "\"If only he'd used his powers for good-\"", "date": "Thursday, February 23, 2012", "text": "Baby brother is a True Crime fanatic.  I'm not sure how it entered our household, but the initiator, the spark that started the flame, had to have been the book \"Bloodletters and Badmen\" by Jay Robert Nash, an American encyclopedia of crime \"from the Pilgrims to the present\".  Baby brother had this book memorized before the age of probably ten. His appetite for the gruesome and bizarre has yet to be sated. I confess I also have a morbid curiosity towards the diabolically clever misdeeds, but my interest cannot hold a candle to his abiding obsession.(I should note that baby bro also presented me with the Three Name Conjecture - that all successful assassins are referred to by their full name: John Wilkes Booth, James Earl Ray, Lee Harvey Oswald, Mark David Chapman, &c, &c. I pointed out that John Hinckley, would-be assassin of Ronald Reagan, is referred to as John Hinckley Jr., and his response was \"How do you know Reagan wasn't assassinated and a lookalike replaced him\"? Hmmm).In any case, we somehow started talking about Dr. John Schneeberger. He managed to avoid arrest by spoofing a DNA test of his blood by implanting surgical tubing filled with another man's blood in his arm and fooling the forensic lab technician into sampling blood from the tube instead of his own veins.Damn, that is a diabolical genius. To which baby bro offered up the TV trope \"If only he had used his powers for good, instead of evil\". To which I offered that I didn't think so. That this type of cleverness could only be used for evil purposes, and if tried to be cleverly benevolent, he would utterly fail. Or more to the ironic point of the Simpsons, he would be like Mr. Montgomery Burns, who is even more evil when tries to do good.Which brings me to news which recently caught my attention, that the equity market is completely fucked up. And if I am looking for blame, I've got to point a finger at high frequency trading (HFT). Done in time span of milliseconds, these trades, carried out by sophisticated algorithms on supercomputers, are really nothing more than a form of parasitism upon financial networks. To those not familiar with the unsavory practice, it looks a lot like an artificial insertion of a middle man, a greasy Mob transaction, wherein \"shipping and handling\" is done for a markup fee without any true added value occurring.It is basically a form of extortion. It goes like this. Most HFT transactions are made to \"sniff out\" the demand for a specific stock. So, ehre I am an institutional buyer, noting (in human time) that a particular stock looks a 'buy' or a 'buy and hold'. People start to buy, and the price of the stock goes up. The evil opportunistic algorithms operating on supercomputers, note this, issue buy orders for the stock and then, a millisecond later, cancel the transaction. They can do this, since 'their' microseconds are 'our' seconds, thousands of transactions per second. By ordering and cancelling a stock, they can determine what maximum market price much the buyer is willing to pay, and then they buy and sell the stock to the unwitting human. The brokerage using the HFT strategy thus pockets both the brokerage fee, and the articifical profit generate through the computer churn on the market.It's an old scam. It goes back a long time, wherein a 'club' of buyers artificially bids up the price of something by incestuously selling it at increasing values between members of the club, until finally dumping the inflated stock onto the suckers, e.g the market. Almost immediately the price drops to nothing, leaving the consumer to absorb the costs of the entire transactional clusterfuck.Interestingly, fully 60 to 70% of all transactions done on the US market are HFT transactions. Of those transactions, more than 95% are immediately cancelled. In total, only 2% of the 20,000 brokerages account for all HFTs, according to this article. Those are the vampire squid motherfuckers sucking on the face of humanity.The consensus suspicion of market manipulation is that HFTs were responsible for the May 6th, 2010 Flash Crash, when the market dropped some 600 points, and then rebounded  some minutes later. Market volatility is now at an all time high, as seen in this article from Zero Hedge.The worry now is that HFTs pose continual future risks of more crashes and spikes to come. So much so, that it garnered the attention of the physics community, as seen in this article: \"Study links ultrafast machine trading with risk of crash\".The authors examined the price logs of over 60 markets from 2006 through 2011. They discovered what they termed \"fracture events\" within the market during this period, some 18, 520 ultrafast black swan events\". Given the speed at which they occur, it is impossible for human supervision to control these events, and black swans have a nasty tendency to turn into Dragon Kings.Since the Flash Crash, the SEC has implemented circuit breakers, but many fear this is not enough. One suggestion is for the implementation of filters in traffic that would slow down opening transactions but not closing transactions, which would hinder a price collapse. Another suggestion is to keep orders exposed for a full second, to accommodate the glacially slow human reaction time. This would reduce the volume of HFT transactions, but not halt them. Still another suggestion is introduce (or rather, reintroduce) a small \"Tobin tax\" upon all share transactions, thus making most HFT scams unprofitable. The latter suggestion seems eminently doable, and makes the most sense.Nevertheless, I took it upon myself to read the paper behind this article (\"Financial black swans driven by ultrafast machine ecology\", http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1448, if interested), and was struck with the fact that there are algorithmic ways of preventing fractures:\"Just prior to a large change, the resulting system is therefore (momentarily) largely deterministic. If left alone, it will produce a large change in a definite direction - however, it can be driven away from the impending crash or spike by increasing the strategy diversity in the following ways, listed here in order of increasing effect but also increasing assumed knowledge: (1) if little is known about the system, our earlier expressions for η < 1 predict that increasing the disorder in the initial strategy allocations by adding agents with randomly chosen strategies will reduce the scale of fluctuations toward their lower bound...\" Okay, okay, there are two other methods listed, but the operative phrase here is insert new agents. In other words, have an computerized algorithmic army out in the transaction space, spiders, searching for unusual transactions, who, when they detect this type of scam, fuck with the HFT brokerage firm's computers.How to do this? Well, conficker comes to mind. Ten million or so CPUs, strategically scattered throughout the globe, all of them fairly near optimal intermediate trading node locations, all running continuously in the background on their pirated PCs, ready to fuck up Wall Street's scams.Antibodies, if you will, to be used against some particularly nasty viruses.If not conficker, then, perhaps a botnet for the rest of us.Now wouldn't that be cool?"},
{"title": "Why isn't String Theory considered Outsider Science?", "date": "Friday, February 17, 2012", "text": "Why aren't string theorists considered cranks. They themselves insist that if there is no empirical proof, then string theory must be considered philosophy. I think they are being overly generous in their dismissal. It should be considered outright bullshit. Wishful thinking. Voodoo.Okay, okay, I know it's all now called M-theory. And any number of books and blogs are out there that say it is all just bullshit. You've got Peter Woit's ongoing blog: \"Not Even Wrong\", and his book: \"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law\". You've got Lee Smolin and the Perimeter Institute investigating loop quantum gravity. Smolin has written a critical book as well: \"The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next\".There is still, to this day, absolutely no empirical proof that string theory is correct, or even that it can predict anything worthwhile. The theories have produced what is known as \"The Landscape\", which consists of perhaps 10 to the 100th power various predicted universes 9although probably more like 10 to the 10500th power). One wag, I think one of the actual theorists, perhaps Susskind, has apocryphally been quoted that \"it predicts every possible universe --- except ours\". String theory apologists, such as Brian Green, have attempted to rationalize its failures by invoking the childish excuse that \"no other theory does any better\", or worse, invoke the multiverse in a bit of hand-waving to suggest that it somehow all works out.But still there is that troubling lack of empirical evidence.Science, at this stage of the game, consists of a foundational triad. The earliest, and still best foundation, is empiricism. If your beautiful theory contradicted by ugly facts, it's bullshit. This goes all the way back to Francis Bacon, and of anything, it separates the practitioners from the cranks. The second foundation is theoretical physics, which is where string theory resides. There have been many cases where theories derived \"from pure thought\" (as Albert Einstein once put it, and I had trouble understanding that remark until I realized he actually meant an argument built up  as the medieval scholastics did, as in \"derived logically from prior inputs\"). This has, in almost cases, after the fact, been every successful at explaining mysteries. But one must always, always, resort to empiricism as a verifier.The third, most recent, and extremely promising, foundation is the Monte Carlo simulation, first automated back in the 1940s at Los Alamos, and today, built up into impressive computational models. Again, there have been successes where the mathematical theory becomes far too complicated for a general solution. But simulation seems to help. We run into (as it turns the same or similar problem theory runs into, which is, even with a watertight logical consistency, your model is only as good as the assumptions. Or in the hep parlance of today \"GIGO: Garbage In, Garbage Out\".So again, I ask, why are string theorists not considered cranks? I'm not the only one asking this question. Margaret Wertheim, in turn, has a book out called \"Physics on the Fringe\", which delves into the world of Outsider Science. I've not read it, but I don't think she interviewed Brian Green. She should have.I would note the defensive comment in the American Scholar article, by one Pavel Nadolsky, who notes that:\"Many difficult calculations that particle theorists have been doing are greatly simplified by organizing them along the lines suggested by string theory. These calculations are tested experimentally at the Large Hadron Collider and Tevatron, and the experimental data  agree with what the string-inspired theoretical methods predict!  In this sense, some implications of string theory are experimentally testable\".True enough Pavel, in the same sense that the explanation of the origin of the universe is not directly testable, one can only build up a evidentiary case for it, one that is mutually consistent. And, as such, the evidence for a Big Bang gets an A minus. One cannot say the same thing for string theory, which, particle colliders or no, still comes in at around a solid D, perhaps even a high F (if there is such as thing). You need a lot more evidence, Pavel! Or, as Richard W Hamming once said \"Many a theoretical physicist has gotten the right number with the wrong equation\"."},
{"title": "About those Kraken...", "date": "Wednesday, February 15, 2012", "text": "I've been preoccupied with maintenance tasks the past few days. They are mostly, in one form or another, time-consuming and mentally effortless enough to allow me time to daydream. And  I've been thinking about a little worldbuilding behind the alien Kraken I introduced a little while back. I was going to draw a picture of one, but I've found out that, not having drawn anything in ten years, my illustrating skills have eroded back to about the 6th grade.True, some of the machine fixing and cleaning tasks required just enough mental effort to annoy me. Others led me to ponder over the ongoing mystery of how little old ladies somehow have enough strength to break shit that a gorilla can't break. Is it just cussed persistence? Carefully concealed superstrength? I don't know.I always assume I have more time between maintenance cycles with the old farts, assuming it takes them longer to break shit. You'd figure it's the youngsters to watch out for... but no.So, and also the metal shop had been past due in the schedule, and that proved to be most amusing. The things you find when cleaning out the machines, for example, provide me amusement. Just the fact that you can find a solid two-inch thick block of sintered powdered metals and abrasives in some of the chop saws and band saw cowlings gives a rueful indication as to how often these machines are looked after.I found an award plaque for Buffalo Grove High School, 1976 wedged in the bottom of the disc grinder's vacuum dust chute. Well, now I know one instance of how often...\"Grey Alien\" by Stephen Warde AndersonNeeds a whole lotta loveIn any case, it gave me time to build up a world around these alien creatures. It's fairly difficult to come up with a convincing alien creature, given that we have kind of a limited knowledge as to what they look like. Oh, you've got the Greys. But, that's so lame. It's just a human fetus. Not very imaginative.The story behind my kraken, which is just a big giant furry octopus, goes back to my college days. A friend of mine and I were having a stoned conversation about Intelligent Life in the Universe. His three-year-old daughter threw a stuffed toy onto the couch. It was a little plush octopus, with googly eyes and a toothy shark's grin.I said, \"Here, this is what real aliens look like. But a lot bigger. They are furry octopoids, and they are Earth's closest alien neighbors, residing 500 million light years from here\".That got a laugh, but it also stuck with me. I mean, why would aliens look terrestrial, let alone look anything like us? And why reside in our galaxy, when we had a whole universe to stage a drama in? Why, even the octopus form is familiar, symmetric, with recognizable sensory organs and familiar appendages. Not really alien. Not really not of this world.So, I had time to build up a history around this creature, and here's what emerged. Did I say history? Fantasy.They are originally from a world that orbited a yellow-white F-type dwarf star. (I use the past tense because it's all gone now, the star expanded into the red giant stage, and the world a crispy critter). It was actually a double world, a binary planet, with the \"moon\" about three quarters the mass of their home world. Which makes their \"moon\" bigger than he Earth. And their world, their home world, was about 1.78 times the mass of Earth, with a similar density but slightly lower metallicity. Gravity there was about 1.5 times Earth gravity. Thus the eight legs to hold them up.  The Kraken race is perhaps a billion years older than us in terms of sapience, and life on their planet appears to have evolved faster. This may have been due to the more frequent extinction events. There are parallels to Earth's geological history. They had a space debris bombardment. They had several global glaciation events. And at least two runaway greenhouse events. It appears that whatever triggers a step forward in complexity has something to do with these catastrophes - provided things remain relatively stable afterwards. One interesting thing to note, almost all multicellular life on their world extends from one class of animals. No doubt due to a particularly rough extinction event, where their animal ancestors toughed it out in some sheltered pond or something. As such, practically every animal that existed on their world used the eight-limbed body plan. This makes us bipedal humans completely, grotesquely, disgustingly alien to them. (They considered wiping us out, but, apparently, find us all highly amusing, and so didn't. They especially love hearing stories about our \"Monkey God\".)The Kraken are cannibals, or probably would be considered as such. They reproduce both sexually and asexually. There are no males or females, rather, sexual reproduction occurs with an exchanged implantation of cloned embryos, and then genetic recombination occurs in the \"womb\". These matings are (outside of a few aberrant religious sects) one-time only events. Family structure is \"matriarchal\" if you can call it that.The asexually produced clones, clutches of them, are raised to be food. Interestingly, there is no attempt to retard sapience in the food animals, thought they are not educated. (There are pornographic and satirical stories of food animals being raised as children, but the practice has never actually occurred). Given that all animal life is superficially similar in form, I suppose the predation should come as no surprise. And given the social and family structures, it's amazing that any social coherence and cooperation occurs at all.Oh, right, their appearance, beyond the body form. Well, they have four eyes, two forward facing binocular eyes, rather disturbingly human looking, with a sclera (white of the eye) for assisting in judging intent. They have two sideward facing eyes, and those are jet black. Two nostrils between the forward and side eyes. And a mouth that looks like a vagina dentata, if the vagina was blue, and the dentata four inch black talons. They have a row of talons on each tentacle, presumably because they were once arboreal. And their anus is well situated away from their ovipositor. And the fact ours (anuses, that is) are right next to our genitalia produces no end of jokes and nicknames for them.Obviously, they have a sense of humor, which is arrested at about the mental and emotional human age of twelve, and the laugh consists of a snort from the nostrils, producing a thin jellied spittle.    Alright, I called all this fantasy. Why? Because of the number assumptions made. First, the fact that they are carbon based, and water mediated. They could have been sulfur-based, liquid ammonia mediated creatures, but, given the universal abundance of the elements, my choice is a safe bet. Choosing an F-type star is a little more risky. But the star tends more towards G, and so lasts a lot longer than just a few billion years, which, I suspect is not long enough for a world. The existence of a moon is a safe bet in that it keeps the axis of rotation stable, and provides some protection from asteroid bombardment. (I have to assume a large jovian world within their solar system, but given the chaotic nature of planetary orbits, perhaps not). The huge fantasy is that we humans can handle a Kraken biosphere, and vice versa. I have to assume at least an RNA world, probably a DNA world, but the same amino acids and proteins? That's probably a big leap. And I didn't even think about whether cells are eukaryotic or not. I kind of assume an intracellular symbiosis should occur before a multicellular one, but there are so many contigencies, that this does not need to follow. Did I mention  that? I didn't.Still the fact that humans and krakens are socializing suggests perhaps either a complete compatibility in disease organisms and allergens, which I find extremely unlikely, or that I failed to mention isolation or prophylactic procedures.As to the Kraken technology, I've got to assume that there exists a plateau, where a diminishing return on innovation kicks in, otherwise, they'd probably ignore us as savages (not to say they don't view humans as savages). Apparently there exists some type of cultural and social similarities that allow for communication, but I figured that was all due to the Kraken, either by augmenting us, or handicapping themselves.Okay, enough wanking for one essay."},
{"title": "It's Africa, Stupid", "date": "Monday, February 13, 2012", "text": "A recent article in the Economist documents African nations increasing demand for a share of the mining profit pie, through higher rents and bigger ownership stakes. Seems only fair to me. The colonial powers managed to pull a major smash and grab operation on that continent for quite some time. Indeed, some truly shameful history has gone on down there, Belgium (Congo) and Portugal (Angola) being two of the worst offenders. These two countries by no means had a monopoly on despicable behavior, but they certainly had respectable franchises on it. Africa may not be the last frontier in terms of resource exploitation - Antarctica still awaits - but they do possess largely untapped and undeveloped mineral and energy resources. In the book \"Untapped: The Scramble for Africa's Oil\", I recall reading a passage about how, during a casual geophysical exploration of the continent during the 1950s, there was rarely a drill test site that did not run into oil. There are also vast mineral deposits still untouched. As to how all of this will be developed, it is hard to say. One cannot imagine the even more precious biological resources of Africa (plants, animals, and ecologies - all disapearing at an alarming rate) remaining unaffected by this. A lot of the mineralogical treasure is due to continental drift and tectonic churn. Much of the geology consists of immensely old craton formations, which have several billion years worth of erosion to deposit any number of heavy, rare, and precious metals throughout the continent. It is estimated that, for example South Africa alone contains some $2.5 trillion worth of gold remaining in the ground, and the magma formation that holds all of this gold extends straight on up both coasts for thousands of miles. If all of the gold were extracted at once, the price of gold would plunge to pennies per ource. But, given that currently each ounce of gold extracted results in anywhere from 20-80 tons of waste materials, not to mention soil and aquifer degradation and poisoning, one wonders what the real price is.  And that's just one of major ore deposits waiting to be dug up. And then there are all the fossil fuels... I recently read how Norway is joining into a series of development partnerships with the Republic of Tanzania. It's nice that one of the world's most fortunate countries (ranked 2nd in GDP per capita) is providing humanitarian aid, but I also can't help but think that there is a profit motive involved as well. The Norwegians realize that, despite tapping only perhaps a third of their proven North Sea oil reserves, they will eventually run out of oil. And given their near superlative knowledge of offshore extraction, they wish to export their knowledge economy to other nations. Norway is courting places like Brazil, Vietnam, Ghana, to name a few.I probably should not be so cynical about this, though."},

{"title": "Too Many Assholes", "date": "Wednesday, February 8, 2012", "text": "Cat Valente. Not familiar with her. A youngster. And a looker. She was a Hugo (that's an Oscar to the SF crowd) nominee for best novel \"Palimpsest\". She has also written a novel called \"The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making\".I've not read either, but I did peruse this story, and I found it interesting and engaging. Good visual imagery, and I'd say pretty clear-eyed and realistic portrayals of being human. She recognizes that we are still magical thinkers, superstitious, primitive, more rationalizing than rational, and that because of the contingencies of evolution, any attempt to make us rational species would be akin to psychic genocide. We would no longer be human. We would be... something else.So, a fantasy writer, and currently guest blogger over a Charlie Stross's place. She recently wrote an essay involving Star Trek Deep Space Nine and made the following two observations about the Star Trek universe:\"Nobody uses social media, and nobody wastes time\".I left a comment on the second portion of her observation (which basically was \"There are plenty of timewasters in Star Trek, but they all are superior beings\") and it drowned without a ripple. I suspect the reason it sank under the waves so quickly is a result of the first part - being that people only pay attention to stuff in their own little worlds. Now, she does realize that Star Trek could not have foreseen -\"Twitter, email, text messages, Facebook, our blogs, Reddit,   news feeds\".- and I know that, had these forms of communication been shown, they would have made for less dramatic TV. And really, that's what it is. But it is an element of folklore now. Like it or not, Star Trek is part of myths and legends now, or the modern version, or rather, the 20th century version.However, I disagree with her conclusion as to where these supposedly new social media are taking us, which, according her:  \"We are a baby hivemind spinning our training wheels\".Maybe. Certainly possible. Or. Or. We may be witnessing the creation of a whole new crop of assholes. And rude, fatuous, and shallow assholes at that.I'm not a big Nietzsche fan, in fact I think he suffered from softening of the brain fairly soon into this writing career, but all this new social media stuff reminds of something he wrote in \"The Wanderer and his Shadow\":\"Premises of the age of machines. The press, the machine, the railroad, the telegraph are the premises from which nobody has dared draw the conclusion for a thousand years\". In other words, don't get cocky. It takes some time for the real consequences - intended or unintended - to resonate down through the ages. Why, the Victorian Internet still isn't done with us. And the fact of the matter is, this new distraction is not all that different from the old distractions that Nietzsche eyed with a hairy old eyeball.And I do think that the new assholes - the twits that tweet, the blowhards that blog, the domesticated animals on Facebook, all pathetically desperate attention seekers - that use the new shit are not only out there, but the new shit seems to have been created by assholes. We find out that Steve Jobs was an ogre. And that Zuckerberg is psychopathic. Or at least a \"backstabbing, conniving, and insensitive\" asshole.  And what about Julian Assange? Isn't he pretty much of an imperious asshole?Look I understand that history is just one string of stories about psychopaths, but can we never break the chain? What do we have to do to get the nice, smart, friendly people to come out on top? Or at least, make them the new normal. Do we need to start rewarding people to not be assholes?I'm not the only one who is noticing this.  Corey Olds, of the Oakland Local, chalks it all up to:\"1) the easy creation of dot-com and social media enterprises by means of venture capital; 2) America’s ever-increasing neoteny--ever notice grown men or women who disgracefully retain all the behavior of children?; 3) the meltdown of any distinction between “high” and “low” culture--we live in a “degraded landscape of schlock and kitsch,” writes Fredric Jameson; and 4) the lack of insurmountable caste barriers requires the new, parvenu assholes like Zuckerberg and Denton to be forever fearful that they might slip back down whence they came and lose their imperial place\". Is there some way we can restructure this new social media to cancel this distressing trend? Isn't there some programmatic override, some parameters,  to preempt these motherfuckers? Isn't there some big red purge button for the intertubes, to, you know, shunt them all off into some digital quarantine zone, Sector A? For Asshole? Or Sector B? For Butthole?Because it is starting to look like the same old shit all over again, but this time Cat Valente's global hive mind will just be a big giant asshole."},

Growing up in Northwest Indiana, I'm ashamed that I speak this way, but so it is.The dialect is a monstrous chimera, an unholy marriage of that awful countryfuck Hoosier buzz-saw-on-sheet-metal twang and the rust-patinaed Northern Cities dialect with all the vowels hammered flat by an industrial sledge. This is pretty close to what the Kraken look likeCouple this fact - that this stranger spoke the same as I - with the fact that the number of humans in this volume of space approaches a homeopath's wet dream of ultra-dilution, then it is a startling coincidence. Couple that coincidence with the fact that the crowd around me consisted of those cute furry octopoid kind-of-cat-headed aliens that call the galaxies of the Horologium Supercluster home, and you've approached a serendipitous anomaly.So, if you haven't figured it out by now, I am, once again in the BOAPWC  - The Best Of All Possible Worlds Convergence, and, yes, I'm sorry, there is no better acronym.And no, I am not sipping a scientifically optimal superlarger in Sam's Pub out Hercules Way. (For those not in the know, I usually inhabit a bar stool there when I write these missives, back in Spiral City, on the world of Alterra, circling a pleasant G-type yellow dwarf star in the galaxy catalogued NGC6264, which is in the Hercules Supercluster some 450 million light years from Earth).And what brings me nearly a billion light years away, way out here to Furry Octopoid Space? I'm sorry, Kraken Space, since they don't mind being called that? Why I'm planning to get a nail pounded in my head. It's a titanium nail. And it seems like it is time for that.But about that Hoosier from Da Region... turns out he had just got a nail in his head, and was on his way back to Earth. Virgil was his name. Didn't catch the last name and didn't think it all that important. I'm sure he mentioned it. I asked him where he originally hailed from, and he told me Lake Station. Well, fuck me.We didn't have much time for a conversation anyway. The Kraken have modified themselves to live on planets surrounding red dwarves, which are the most abundant of stars. And these worlds are typically low metal planets with no magnetic fields. Sometimes the Furry Octopoids modify the worlds, inject a metal core in them. Most times not. And on this particular world, not. Red dwarves are cantankerous stars, with more than your normal stellar storms and flares cropping up. We both stood out there in a city plaza, this kind of spongy gray surface surrounded by Doctor Seuss buildings, with our UV goggles on. His teeth were a sickly day-glo green and his acne scars shone white beneath his skin from flare storm. That angry little red star up there in that purple sky. Yeah, best to get inside, so he on his way to the spaceport, and me to my \"medical\" appointment.I guess I should clarify the whole nail in the head thing. It's not really a nail, but it feels like it for awhile. It's some pretty sophisticated nanotechnology. And yes, they do plant it right in your head. Usually, but not always, in the left temple, but seeing I'm left-handed, for me, just behind the right ear. Go figure. The purpose of the nail is to get your mind right. Something the Furry Octopoids figured out, well, about the time of Earth's Devonian. Yes, they do have a bit of a head start on us.The further, the closerBut you know, when the Earth scientists first opened the very first throats of the very first Everett wormholes, we really didn't much of a clue as to the practical idiosyncrasies involved. Like the fact that more distance out you cast your wormhole, the more accurate is your aim. Kind of a perverse inverse square of precision.Those wormholes aimed a few dozens of light years out ended up all over the goddamn sky, whereas, the wormholes aimed out millions or billions of light years further ended up pretty much Nixon's nuts on target. (Note: the diagram to the right? the equation should read: r = M * E / h-bar. I know you noticed the error. Hush now.)It looked like a lot of expeditions and colony ventures would be lost in space and time forever, until we humans chanced upon a world full of Kraken. After a brief fumbled attempt at communication (which amounted to wild gesticulating, strange pantomimes, and shouting loudly and slowly \"We come from Earth! Where the hell are we?\"), our expedition scouts were seized by taloned fuzzy tentacles and held still long enough to drive nails into their heads. And our scouts suddenly, instantly, perfectly, calmly understood what the Kraken were saying.Well, it turned out the nail to the head was more than a universal translator or telepathic facilitator. Suddenly, that evolutionary kluge we call a mind, with its deliberative (can't really call it reasoning) faculties getting cues from the cobbled-together, ancestral, reflexive portions of our minds, that tangled and frizzed up collection of cognitive dissonances, suddenly, got all straightened out and put in order. It wasn't exactly like that. Not quite exactly like that. The kluges, the clumsy and inelegant engineering of our minds and brains, were still there, its just that the nail in the skull made you recognize it. And compensate. Kind of like meditation. Or medication. But it also provided some extra computational space to supplement our prefrontal lobes so that the deliberative process has the time that, well, evolution hasn't granted us yet. I'm guessing we would have calmed down in a hundred thousand years or so, but if you get the opportunity...Needless to say, the modified humans, the ones that had a nail in their skull, preferred the company of the Kraken, but the Kraken, or rather the one krake, said:\"No, I'm sorry. You can't hang with us. We've got important matters to attend to. But... hey, if any of your kind want to get their mind right, they can see us to get a nail driven in their head. Oh, and here is the simple mathematical trick for not getting lost in space and time. And you should be able to find all your lost expeditions with it. So, later, dudes\".So, yeah, here I am to get my mind right. You'll still be able to find me at the bar, though. When I'm out Hercules Way."},
{"title": "Suffer For Fashion", "date": "Monday, February 6, 2012", "text": "Back when I had a real job, there was a woman in the office who was a complete fluffhead. Just a head completely full of lint, dandelion fluff, cotton swabs, and maybe a packing peanut or two. She went to the tanning salon every day. As a result, her skin had a strange tone to it, rather like a parboiled chicken, or something in tone that approached the hazard orange of a biohazard sign. She just didn't tan, and as a result the skin coloration was, I guess, just a permanent sunburn. She also dowsed herself with way, way, way too much perfume.I made up a joke about her: \"How come ____ looks sunburned all the time? Because her fucking perfume burns a hole in the ozone layer!\" In retrospect, it wasn't that funny, but in any case, she clearly suffered for fashion. She wanted the healthy tanned glow of an active out-of-doors lifestyle, and this was her way of doing it.  Lots of people disfigure themselves in an attempt to be more attractive.Here's something that isn't a new technique, but it recently caught my attention. Gregg Homer of Stroma Medical has developed a laser treatment to burn all the pigment out of your iris. This irreversible process will burn your brown eyes blue. It's not approved in the US yet, and when it is, the cost will probably be around $5000 per eye, with, so far, minimal side effects and the long-term effects are unknown. Some eye doctors worry that the procedure could cause a potentially blinding condition called pigmentary glaucoma (which is known to be associated with the chronic seepage of melanin into the fluid within the eye, and how the fuck that occurs naturally I really don't want to know).Is it really that objectionable? I mean, people disfigure themselves in worse ways. I've seen some really awful tattoos and the whole scarification thing pretty much baffles me. Or when Asians have their epicanthic fold removed to appear more Western. The eyelid surgery doesn't look right, because Asian have a round eye socket, and Westerners have an eye socket that looks more aviator sunglasses, so an Asian with this operation just looks... weird.So yeah, there are worse things than burning your eyes with a laser. But still. You really hate your eye color that much? I mean, what are blue eyes good for?I asked Google. Google didn't really give me a satisfactory answer, but then Its doing that a lot lately.Still, the myth is that blue-eyed people see better in the dark. Is it true that there is a general trend for Northern peoples (some of whom have blue eyes) also have bigger brains? Maybe, but it would seem only in the occipital region, where vision is processed, but no real functionality has ever been adequately demonstrated. It's fun to think about. The idea that blue eyed people see better in the dark.Neanderthals (and to look at my big yellow Scandinavian horse teeth, you'd suspect I've some of their genes) had a pronounced occipital bun at the back of their skulls. Anthropologists see the enlarged back of the Neanderthal skull as a counterweight to the heavy browed and jawed face. Were I to speculate, I'd say they were night or gloom hunters, which would tie in well with some bits of folklore about giants and ogres and trolls.But blue eyes better seeing in the dark? Well, my personal experience is I have a hard time with glare. I'm told it gets worse as you get older. But I don't have a hard time with grey gloomy days. In fact, I like grey gloomy days! And if you happened to have lived in a really cold shitty grey gloomy climate for some tens of thousands of years, it kind of makes sense that people who are bummed by this would get deselected. But again, blue eyes have anything to do this? I doubt it.Regardless, if someone is going to fuck with my eyes so that I can make a fashion statement, I think I would prefer an operation where they insert some other controllable pigmentation. You  know, some tunable pigment so that I can change my eye color at will.But honestly, sweetie, think about that hard, because I can personally attest to the fact that brown eyes are not boring."},
{"title": "You Are Here", "date": "Friday, February 3, 2012", "text": "Almost three decades ago, I went to the Exploratorium in San Francisco. It reminded me of the Museum of Science And Industry in Chicago, or the Deutsches Museum, which I went to daily during my week's stay in Munich. If you have any doubt that I harbor the brain of a five-year-old, these visits should utterly erase it. Not only am I a science geek, but a hands-on science geek. I guess that comes from being a primate.The next time I was in SF, maybe two to three years later, I went again to the Exploratorium. And that time I left the gift shop with a sweatshirt that had an image of the galaxy printed on it, with an arrow pointing into a spiral arm two-thirds of the way out from galactic center that said \"You Are Here\". And I wore that sweatshirt unashamedly until became a ratty paint-rag. I would even, if properly jollied, sing \"The Galaxy Song\", and sometimes when I was wearing it.Can you possibly think of an even more circus geek thing to do? Well, how about this. Our local stellar neighborhood, or even, the galactic neighborhood, has become rather boring and tame to me.(I actually made a 3D model of the closest stars. I mounted the stars in their proper positions. I found different sized plastic beads to represent stars large and small. I glued together beads for the binary and trinary stellar systems. I even painted little plastic beads the correct color. And worst of all, I did not label them, as I knew the star names by heart. I was twenty-two years old when I did that. I kept that stellar diorama until well into my thirties. Sad, huh?) I didn't go quite so far with making a diorama of the galaxy, but give me an excuse, and I might.http://www.3dgalaxymap.com/http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.htmlLately, I'm fascinated with the bigger picture. Here's one: This is the Local Galactic Group. As you can see, it is dominated by two giant galaxies, our Milky Way, and the Andromeda Galaxy, M31. The Andromeda galaxy is on a collision course with our galaxy. It is scheduled to smack us about two billion years from now. I wouldn't worry overmuch about it, as the meeting will be about the same as two clouds of cigarette smoke banging into each, although the mutual gravitational pull will merge our galaxies together into a big elliptical egg. There is a chance that our Sun could be thrown clear of the whole mess, in which case, Old Sol may end up spending its doddering years drifting through intergalactic space. But fear not, we won't get too far out before it (the Sun, the planets) goes gablooey into a white dwarf. But there is a much bigger picture. The Local Galactic Group encompasses a volume of billions of cubic light years, but the Virgo Supercluster, our larger home in the Universe contains quadrillions.And it just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.That's what she said."},
{"title": "The Uncanny Valley", "date": "Wednesday, February 1, 2012", "text": "For some reason lately, I've been having these dreams that, for lack of a better term, seem to have a metaphorical draw towards class warfare. Now, I myself have about a 50/50 work experience between white and blue collar jobs. And in the dreams I'm pretty much a working class hero, with, at various times and guises, my antagonists being upper middle or ruling class assholes. And the things, these snobbish assholes who treat me with disdain in the dreams are not quite human. Not primitive subhuman, but more like, soft, squishy, chinless, pale, pudgy, and puny, dressed in gaudy country club attire. More like uncanny humanoids with Mafia-style bad taste than subhumans.Well, surprise! The on-line magazine \"The Atlantic\" has a fun little article entitled \"The Uncanny Valley: What Robot Theory Tells Us About Mitt Romney\". I know I'm not the first to notice the metaphorical comparison. I'm not even the first to refer to him as the Romneytron 9000 (or some variation thereof). It's not really fair to call Romney a robot. Of course he's human, unless....Unless the Mormons are actually a time-traveling conspiracy, spanning the ages to complete the total and utter subjugation of all humans throughout time. Then a case can be made for Romney the Robot. But of course that's all bullshit. I mean, if they was a time-traveling organization, we'd all be Mormons now, unless they are slowly losing the timewar... I'd have to review my temporal physics class notes... ... anyway, the article goes into more length than I would care to cover in explaining the whole Uncanny Valley theme, and Romney's apparent image problem. So you just go read that link, and I'll wait.Done already? Fucking A! You know the one thing I notice is pretty much the whole Republican field fits somewhere on the human familiarity curve. I went ahead and borrowed the graphic from that article, and modified it to suit my observations.So, yup, there's Romney, alternately deer-in-the-headlights while his brain processes, processes, producing some awkward behavioral output, or, yes, some genuine human emotion there, but restrained by arcane Harvard mental trainings. Almost Spock, but not as human. And no, not even that, Obama gets the Spock award, for \"No where is he more desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans\".Then there's Newt Gingrich, who gets the animated bloated corpse title, and enough said on that.Ron Paul. Can anyone find me a picture of him where his mouth doesn't look like a puckered asshole? I mean, yeah, he does have some muppet qualities, but that just makes me wonder whose hand is up his ass?Santorum? Goddamn, that fucking Mr. Sardonicus rictus he calls a smile is just fucking creepy as hell. It's more reptilian than anything else.So there you go. The rest of the field that dropped out or never joined? Who gives a shit. They're losers."},
{"title": "Is It Art? Guest Editorial", "date": "Tuesday, January 31, 2012", "text": "Nude Descending A StaircaseThere is an apocryphal story (apocryphal in the sense that I just made this shit up right now), that the day after the close of the Armory Show, March 16, 1913, former President Theodore Roosevelt was granted a private tour.TR did not shoot well, but he did shoot often, and so, armed with his trusty F-Grade A.H. Fox 12-gauge shotgun, TR eventually scored a number of hits on quite a few pieces, all the while roaring his battle cry \"THAT'S NOT ART!\" The final tally by the curatorial staff was TR: 14, ART: 0. The surviving objects were sent on to show at the Art Institute of Chicago, and then on to the Copley Society of Art in Boston. By then, many other big game hunters had attritted all the works of American artists. Huzzah!Alright, so maybe it didn't quite play out like that, but the important point was TR's role as, not just a viewer, but an indispensable participant in an informational exchange. With that in mind, Eldest Bro sent me an email, which I now present with commentary (interspersed in emboldened italics).\"Too big to fit in the comments section of your blog, but this is something that has occupied my mind for a long. OK, you have Spoken, so now I will take my turn in the Bitch Box.\"As the late, great FZ once said, \"Alright, whip it out\".\"Many years ago I had an artist as a house mate. He was a cowboy artist, by which I mean that he was an actual cowboy, from Okanagan, Washington, wore a hat, drove a pickup, the whole schmear. And he was in the graduate Art school program -.\" I remember that guy! Dana something. He was a potter, or a ceramicist. I liked his work. I remember the piece with the psychoanalyst's couch, with the cowboy boots at the foot, and I think a lasso, draped over one corner. \"-Our schedules did not intersect much, so most of the time we spent together was watching big-time wrestling on Saturday mornings. One day, motivated by a big pot of coffee and an especially stimulating match between Mad Dog Vachon and Ivan Kohloff, we had a cerebral discussion about the nature of Art.\"Well see, right there, you guys had just watched Art on the TV, in case you are wondering what Art is...  \"Dana's point of view (and I say this because his name was Dana), was that an object of Art had some ineffable Quality, shall we call it Beauty, that conferred upon it the status of Art. My perspective was much more pragmatic, namely that Art was defined by the presence of a Frame or \"boundary\", indicating where the Art picked up and the Rest Of The World left off. I am sure this is derivative of a deep philosophical thinker somewhere but, nevertheless, I came up with it all on my own.\"Brain Map of the WorldI would suggest that Dana was wrong but for the wrong reasons. I think it obvious that there are certain innate gravitation that we, as animals living in this universe, are quite naturally subject to. But a curious consequence of this philosophical stance is that there should exist objects that possess no ineffable qualities, and are therefore completely invisible. (See graph at right).\"My definition was motivated by a few observations:   1) For just a picture or such, there is definitely a frame or at least the edge of a canvas.   2) On the occasions I had ventured into his studio, which was shared with several other students, it   appeared to me that the mix on display was about 90% Crap and 10% Art. This was suspiciously similar to the makeup in my own field of practice, engineering.   3) If there is not a frame, there is definitely a boundary of some kind. In a museum this might be a velvet rope or a guard; in a studio it is an artist shouting \"Hey! Don't touch that!\". (Me: \"I thought it was just a sawhorse.\")Sturgeon's Law: \"90% is all crap\" originally attributed by him to only his own prose work, has now been shown to apply to every form of human endeavor. I would now categorize it as a Universal Principle, up there with Murphy's. As to context, see the last essay. \"Another interpretation is that Art consists of a communication between Artist and Appreciator of Art, and that this can take place across centuries or millennia, and across cultures. The Venus of Willendorf springs to mind here. But yet this brings up more questions. Once, on a camping trip, my wife picked up an interesting stone (she has a talent for this sort of thing) which upon further inspection bore a native American petroglyph. Was this art? Or was it just someone relieving the tedium of a long day long ago? (Much as modern teenagers will draw a cock and balls on anything that stands still long enough.)Well, that would be the Communication Theory of Art, or the Semiotics. Thus: Emitter ==> Objule (Object/Module) ==> Noise ==> Observerand the problem with this particular model, at least from an empirical or behaviorist standpoint, is that neither the intent of the artist (emitter) nor the attributes of the objule (the emitted object/module, which I done just made up) have the slightest bearing upon how the observer observes it.  All that matters is the observer (using his associational engine) and the universe in which the objule is embedded contextually. But of course not quite. More kind of like a strange combination of evolution (selection of a species does not occur in a vacuum, but is a global heuristic), and entanglement (granting, if you will, some small universal interactions). Or if you wish, He who Detected It, Ejected It\"For me, some of what I and other engineers do qualifies as Art. By this I mean a nifty trick, or a sweet hack that makes things work in a beautiful way. So, engineering can be Art. We exploit physical principles, same as any other artist, one requires a mastery of the medium. Just open up an i-Whatever or a laptop and think about the cleverness involved in putting all that stuff together and making it hum. Again, 90% Crap (Thigh-Master, Chrysler Cordoba) and 10% Art (DEC VAX, Ferrari Testarossa). I am not sure where the Popeil Pocket Fisherman fits into this scheme.\"Absolutely. Or professional wrestling. Or ditch digging. Or nest building. Or dolphin bubbles. Or corvid aerial acrobatics. Or canine frisbee catching. I now feel that it is All Art.  \"The \"designation\" theory brings up some problems of its own. Who knows what M. Duchamp had in mind with his urinal?\"On more than one occasion Duchamp said that the piece was meant as a joke. But once the audience accepted it as an art object, the genie was let out of the bottle. Duchamp's intent was no longer relevant.\"As it happens I have visited an immense collection of Duchamp artifacts at the Staatliches Museum Schwerin-Kunstsammlungen (pretty obscure I know, but I just stumbled across it on a trip) in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and again, the 90% rule was in effect. (Please note, this is Sturgeon's Law, I deserve no credit.) Was the urinal just a big middle finger to the \"Art\" establishment?\"Yes.\"Or maybe it just made M. Duchamp feel kinda funny and he wanted to share that with the rest of us? Yes.\"(Note that both of those fall into the \"communication\" theory.) So, by the \"designation\" or \"objet trouve\" rationale, could I go into a restroom at SFO, sign and date a urinal, and charge admission to \"my work of Art\"? Or demand that it be removed and placed in its rightful location at SF-MOMA? What about a fully functional urinal connected to plumbing? Can that be Art? What about a guy taking a whiz into \"my\" urinal? Is that Performance Art? Can I demand that he show up at 11:00 every day and urinate to preserve the Integrity of the Work? According to modern art theoretics, if you can find a willing and accepting audience, yes. If you get them to accept it as a performance piece, you can piss in it too.\"So many questions. These are right up there with other imponderables. Why did Walter Payton never score a rushing touchdown in Super Bowl XX? Why doesn't Rex Ryan keep his yap shut and just coach his team like Bill Belichick? Why does Michelob make you fart so much? Why? Why? Why?A guy could go crazy thinking up the answers to all these questions. Worse yet, a guy could lose his marbles thinking that there are even answers to be had.\"Eee-yup."},
{"title": "Yes, But Is It Art?", "date": "Thursday, January 26, 2012", "text": "Yesterday, one of the art faculty assistant professors, named Charlie if that makes any difference, happened to see the book \"Survival of the Beautiful\" on my desk. An Art Conversation followed.I really fucking dread those conversations. At least, the part where I don't talk.Charlie, after asking for a synopsis of the book, proceeded to opine about all things Art. You have to understand, the reason I pretty much dread these conversations is, even though these professor types have a solid university grounding in art-making and art theory, they invariably will pull references from a more general ground of human behaviors to justify their opinions. Since I'm, in 99% of the cases, much more familiar with their references to (take your pick) evolution, natural selection, quantum physics, technological progress, the useless and superstitious topic of memes, group theory, graph theory, psychology, neurology, brain structures, holism, science, culture, the Internet, etc. etc., it gets to be a pretty fucking tedious conversation pretty fucking quickly. Sometimes it sucks to be a smart-ass.And usually, they've got it all incomplete and ass-backwards. Artists, like all experts, are not exactly the sharpest knives in the drawer - outside of their field. And I learned a long time ago that conversations with professors require strategic corrections and a great deal of tongue-biting, and internalizing of cringes and winces as they fold, bend, spindle and mutilate 10,000 years of hard-earned human knowledge - just so that you can keep the conversation moving forwards. The other cringe-worthy portion of these conversations is that these professors do not realize they are indoctrinated religionists, that their opinions are faith-based. That they, like anyone who spends time specializing in a limited field of knowledge, are brain-washed into certain beliefs. In my case, studying mathematics, we are constantly pounded with the unfounded idea that number is real, that these systems have some existence independent of reality. As a mathematical apostate, a self-defrocked priest, I call this delusion Platonic Derangement Syndrome. It exists outside of the field of mathematics, of course.  It exists in the art world in the following modern tenet: \"Anything can be Art\".Of course, the demon of the perverse requires that at some point I take the wheels off of these conservation by offering up an opinion they cannot agree with. I have to commit a heresy. It's my nature, I think. Part pure cussedness. Part drama queen.Oh, man, lack of consensus, putting up an obstacle, is not something they handle well. It is generally physically displayed by the complete shutdown of facial and gestural animation. The eyes dull. The pupils contract. The frown muscles go rigid. The shoulders slump. The chest caves. It's actually kind of funny to watch. So, this time out, there came a point where I offered that something like Damien Hirst's pickled shark wasn't really Art anymore. It was a business commodity. A totem. A currency fetish. This was, of course, a blasphemy. The usual response is generally what is considered a mild ad hominem, that I am either a bit anti-intellectual, or ignorant, as in not trained in the field, or a philistine, or even smug, or even reflective of a sad decline in our society that I can't see that this is clearly a great work of art with a capital A.And the, wow, the response from Charlie was pretty sad. \"Um. No. Yeah, it is. It's Art\". But there is always that quaver of uncertainty in that assertion.Now, I have a variety of ways to go here, but this is the response I chose, based on what Charlie had said earlier:\"You claim, because of what Marcel Duchamp did in the 1917 Armory Show, display a urinal as an art object, that now anything can be Art.\" \"Yes.\"\"You back up this claim with the use of context. That it is all about context\".\"Yes\".\"The nature of the work itself is irrelevant -\" (and before he can object) \"- the intent of the artist and the intrinsic qualities of the work are not what matter, but rather how it is situated, and valued by the audience, by the appreciators of the art work\".\"...yes\". (Charlie says this only because he himself has at some prior point said this in his lecture to me).\"So - \" and here I grab and read from \"Survival of the Beautiful\" \"-the nature of the work itself matters little. It really can be anything, as long as a coherent story has arisen about why the work should be appreciated, and a community of tastemakers and art lovers evolves to celebrate the work (or style) and promotes it strongly enough so that it will endure in society long enough to make a difference\".\"...yes...\"\"And so, this category you, we, have created is changeable, in flux, not tied down to the standard Boolean binary logic of categories. Like a Venn diagram, it can occupy more than one set. Like an electron, it can be in two places at once?\"\"(sigh) yes\". (Because he has said this as well).\"So now, you have the general populace, which looks at the pickled shark, and says, 'That's retarded', and rejects it as art, then the audience of the hedge fund manager, who bought it clearly for sake of status, and his social circle, who call it art, but not really. And then that circle of art critics, gallery owners, collectors, who call it art. So, what is it? Whose perception wins out?\"\"I... look it's Art. OK?\"\"...well done, Charlie.\""},
{"title": "\"Survival of the Beautiful\": A Review", "date": "Wednesday, January 25, 2012", "text": "I miscalculated and checked out one too many books from the library this past month. As a result, \"Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science, and Evolution\" by David Rothenburg ended up being the bathroom book, which I only skimmed. I think to need to check this book out again at some future time for a more thorough read.There is a scene in the movie \"Apollo 13\" where, because the astronauts needed to power down the command module (CM) to conserve battery power, Astronaut Ken Mattingly (played by Gary Sinise), and Controller (EECOM Arthur) John Aaron (played by Lorne Dean) must come up with a way to power up the CM. They have a limited amount of battery power. With Mattingly seated in the capsule simulator back on Earth, taking no breaks, and after several failed attempts at powering up, they finally come up with a procedure they can use to restart the CM.I would submit to you, based upon the high selection pressures (life or death) involved, that the final powering up procedure was a beautiful thing - a work of art.    On the other hand, country western music, hip hop, rap, or opera, with generally very low selection pressures involved, is not so beautiful, but still a work of art.That's one of the things I take from this book. Not so much a question of whether of not something is Art (a stupid question BTW, like asking if something is Elephant), but whether it is high or low. Great or shitty. Especially now, in the 21st century, some one hundred years after Marcel du Champ let the genie out of the bottle and set it up so that anything, and I mean anything, could be Art.Since I had only a chance to skim, here's a random quote from the book:\"The beautiful things we make aspire to be necessary as the rules of nature and forms of life that time has massaged into being through the evolution of beauty, which is such an important part of the complete development of life. We will never be sure of ourselves as the aesthetic of an single species is. Without thinking or wondering, the peacock knows he is nothing without his tail. Life is beautiful as it lives and endures, not needing to question whether it could have taken another path. Only humanity is plunged into such doubt, and only we have the choice to take the beautiful seriously, or not\". If Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes are Art, then a bowerbird's bower is Art.  That is part of my take from this book. The rest? Well, some things I had already concluded before reading. Like, animals do appreciate beauty. Animals do experience joy and delight. I know this because I am an animal sharing this planet with other animals. Other animals that share the exact same internal brain structures as I do, with a connectome that more or less gets activated by the same stimuli.Natural selection, it seems to me, favors animals that enjoy living, that avoid the painful and the terrible, as opposed to animals that merely experience and record living. And our forms have been selected on that basis. Rothenburg explores the idea that forms found in Nature are inherently beautiful. That they are converge on the beautiful, based upon limiting aspects of the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology. That animals (including us apes) do indeed appreciate this beauty, take pleasure from it, delight in it, and therefore select for it. That beauty is chosen through the process of sexual selection, in the ongoing Darwinian arms race between male characteristics and female delight. As such, biologists, and more directly evolutionary psychologists, seem to explain why animals desire, but not what animals desire.To some degree, this theme has been explored in the late Denis Dutton's book \"The Art Instinct\". However, Rothenberg partially rejects the evolutionary psychologists' approach of explaining away all forms in terms of fitness and function. I tend to agree with this, mainly because their Kipling-esque \"just-so\" theorizing rarely is based upon empirical observation.Rothenberg repeats is the whole arbitrariness of form. Again, biologists would prefer that the form have some function, some reason to explain fitness, either as a feature, or a handicap. But there are many cases (think the Darwin's frustrations with the peacock's tail) in which the best explanation for the origin of a selected form is that it is, or was, utterly arbitrary - in keeping with the whole idea of random mutation, or random selection. Though not entirely. There is a ratchet of progress, a conservation of innovation, that occurs in the evolutionary record. And a convergence of functionality as well. When you consider that things like camera-style eye has independently developed six times throughout the history of life on Earth, you start to think about convergence - similar solutions to similar challenges.How this relates to human art making, I never got to that point. But I just may have to re-read the book \"Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind\" by Gary Marcus."},

Dangerously stupid. Take for example, his latest editorial in the Wall Street Journal: \"Republicans Deserve to Lose\".Yes, they do. Stephens has at least that right. What he fails to do, consistently, is to connect the dots completely to see the whole picture, which is that the Republican Party is a failed institution.Ideologically bankrupt. Obsolete. Decrepit. Backwards. The Whig Party of the 21st Century.After realizing that the Republican clown car currently running the circuit for presidential candidate, and finding all occupants wanting, Stephens offers up this pathetically clueless complaint:\"Finally, there are the men not in the field: Mitch Daniels, Paul Ryan, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Haley Barbour. This was the GOP A-Team, the guys who should have showed up to the first debate but didn't because running for president is hard and the spouses were reluctant.\"Seriously? That's the GOP A-Team? How tragically, myopically, profoundly addled is Stephens. Stumbling perplexedly through the conservative wasteland, he does not realized that, aside from the GOP possessing the same lack of integrity as the Democrats, and vastly surpassing them in hypocrisy, they also possess no vision, no clarity of thought, no substantial intellectual metabolism, but instead display only a machine-like propensity to offer up a calcified, fossilized, plodding stale old program of more of the same. Same old failed programs. Time to scrap that rickety old computer.Stephens mistakes the symptoms for the rot. If the likes of Mitch Daniels, Paul Ryan, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and Haley Barbour represent the intellectual elite of the GOP, then I'm surprised the rest of the party doesn't wear bearskins and use stone tools. Quite simply, there's no there there anymore. There was never any there there.And it's hard to move forward when all you can do is look backwards."},
{"title": "The Duct Tape Lesson", "date": "Monday, January 23, 2012", "text": "Back in the late 70s, my younger brother was driving a car that was composed of around 70% duct tape.  I don't know what kind of car it was. I called it the \"Death Car\".I made fun of his car a lot. But you know, he was always prepared. The car was such a piece of shit, that he kept spare parts in the trunk (hinged, by the way, with duct tape). But it was a perverse form of preparation, as it turned out that the one part he always needed in a break down was not in the trunk.Still, the lesson is, be prepared. This past Friday, I was not.You may or may not have heard about it on the news, as it was pretty much a local weather phenomenon, but we got a big snow in Chicago Friday afternoon. Seven inches in as many hours. Naturally, traffic sucked. Naturally, I had to go down to NW Indiana to help my niece move. What was normally a one and a half hour trip took me about five hours.Now, that's not that big of a deal. I managed to creep through Chicago before the heart of storm turned the everything into a parking lot. And, being from NW Indiana, which is the western edge of the Lake Michigan snowbelt, this was nothing new or unusual. Take your time. Max speed 35 mph on unplowed roads. The only casualties in ditches in the meridians are the giant SUV assholes who think they are indestructible.To borrow from Jean-Paul Sartre, \"Hell is other drivers\".Chicago Skyway BridgeSo, no big deal. After getting tired of listening to the radio, I sang Beatles songs in a cat voice.\"Meow, meow, meow\". I've never had a problem entertaining myself.The only fly in the ointment was that the driver's side windshield wiper decided to become unhinged, right when I was on the Skyway Bridge (which, by the way, is next to one of my favorite bridges, the Norfolk Southern vertical lift railroad bridge spanning the Calumet River).I am proud that I had the presence of mind to turn off the wipers before the blade disappeared into Hammond someplace. So, I cranked the defrost heater and blower to maximum, and tried to think what I had in the car I could use to secure the blade.I like the housesAnd the answer was duct tape! Too bad I didn't have any.So, that stretch of the Indiana East-West tollroad has got nothing on it. I mean nothing. Most exits are tortuously circuitous switchbacks to the entrances, and what with six to seven inches of snow on the roads, I ain't getting off. I drove about fifteen miles without wipers in blizzard.Really it wasn't all that bad. I've been through much, much worse.Duct Tape to the rescue!Finally, though, I made it to a gas stop, and I asked the guy if he had any duct tape. He jerked his thumb at the notions display, and they had some weird imitation duct tape. Which I bought. And wrapped it on the blade, and off I went.It's still on there. The way I am, it will be on there until it falls off, sometime in June.But I did go out and buy some proper duct tape, which is now in my car."},

I mean, children and guns, they usually don't go well together. Playing cowboy, I just can't see Mitch McConnell doing that well, unless it's the \"Brokeback Mountain\" kind of cowboy.Pipeline map courtesy www. theodora.comIn any case, the Republican Superpac commercials are getting one thing right - not building the Keystone XL pipeline will not produce jobs (and it won't produce as many jobs as advertised). They probably could have (uncharacteristically) erred on the side of virtue and left it at that, but no, they have to go and fucking lie about how it threatens America's energy independence.So, yeah, Transcanada is temporarily foiled, and does not get to ship the tar sand oil down to Houston for refining into diesel, loading into supertankers for export, and shipping to Europe and Latin America. Because that was the plan. No oil for US. Period. So all that bullshit about US energy independence is a fucking lie. It's all about the money. Big surprise.You know, in my neck of the woods, the BP oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana just spent a shitload of dollars (~$3.8 billion) updating the works to handle bitumen - the Canadian extra heavy tar sand oil.It's thick, heavy, caustic, nasty shit. It requires a lot of energy to extract it and refine it.You know, uh, the refineries in Whiting and East Chicago aren't as bad as they used to be. I remember having to let lose with some major farts to sweeten the air inside the car when I'd drive by them.Now it's all invisible, odorless carcinogens being pumped into the community - much, much better.You would think the Republicans would be calling for expansion of the existing Keystone pipeline, since that actually does end (sometimes) in American gas tanks.Or better still, build a pipeline from Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf coast. This would help alleviate a persistent price differential between Brent crude, the global benchmark oil, and West Texas Intermediate. Cushing, where most American oil is delivered, is landlocked. There is not nearly enough pipeline capacity to the Gulf where global markets set prices. So, local Texas refiners are probably real happy to buy just cheap Cushing crude and then sell their refined at the much dearer global prices. Nice tidy profit there, like they don't profit enough, right?But Whiting and East Chicago? It don't make money the way the foreign markets do, and you can't ship the refined stuff on supertankers through the Saint Lawrence Seaway, so... America needs that Keystone XL Pipeline! Well, certain Americans do! People like Thurston Howell the III, I mean, uh, Mitt Romney, and the Party of Fuck You, We Got Yours!"},
{"title": "Low-Hanging Fruit", "date": "Tuesday, January 17, 2012", "text": "I want to apologize to myself and my readers for this essay, \"State of the World: 2032\". I originally figured it would be a great deal of fun, just wild-ass speculation with no holds barred. Somewhere along the line it got all conservative and boring. Why, I even promised three game-changing predictions and carried through with nary a one.I don't know, are we going to count room temperature superconductors as one of them?Oh sure, but let's develop it some. So, let's start with superconductors. This property was discovered by accident one hundred years ago, in 1911, when Dutch physicist HeikeKamerlingh Onnes cooled a bit of mercury to the temperature of liquid helium,4 degrees Kelvin (-452F, -269C). All electrical resistance in the mercury droplet disappeared, and it became a perfect conductor of electricity.Fast forward some seventy years, ignore a lot of incremental advances, and witness something of a breakthrough in the mid 1980s, when, of all things, ceramic insulators where found to lose all electrical resistance at around the balmy temperature of liquid nitrogen, some 77K (-321F, -196C). Well, specially formulated ceramic insulators, doped with cuprates (chemicals involving oxides of copper), but the idea of higher temperature superconductors has gripped researchers and triggered a quest in the physics community ever since. Problem is, they still don't know why it does what it does. Such is the way of technology. Theory, for the most part, almost always lags behind effects.So, let's say the doped rare earth/cuprate ceramic idea pans out, but it ends up being a ferrate ceramic jelly - a cheap, easy to make and bake, flexible, sturdy material that loses all electrical resistance below, say, 97F. The important idea here being that its cheap.What happens? Well, superconductors can be used for magnetic levitation for trains, very efficient magnetic resonance imaging, lossless power generation, transformers, power transmission, supercomputers, particle accelerators,  The obvious consequences are all power lines are stripped out. Well, maybe not right away, but ongoing. Oh, hell, more than that, the whole electrical grid gets updated and metering of electricity for the consumer should drop to the absurd. Literally absurd, as in tenths of pennies per kilowatt (really think the savings will be passed on to you?).The jump in efficiencies is mind-boggling, but that's the obvious stuff. Particle accelerators go from CERN or Fermilab to much smaller than tabletop stuff  - gigawatt emitters that fit in the palm of your hand. Not phasers exactly, or blasters, more like lightning guns. (But, uh, wear protective gear to avoid french-frying yourself). Oh great, practical ray guns for dipshits.With extremely efficient magnetic discriminators, combined with tiny petaflop computers, something like a hairnet can be worn on your head that takes the place of those giant donut MRI machines. Aside from the obvious medical imaging uses, it also means telepathic beanies, or teeper skull caps. These ultra-tiny, ultra-sensitive, super-powerful magnetic sensors can read your brain. Or write to it, if that's your clever hack.I predict some one will be mind controlled with one things, maybe a robot zombie act, like a robot drone, or better still, if the resolution and bandwidth is sufficient, someone can use a suitably skullcapped porn star to enjoy a vicarious sexual experience, - telefucking.Okay, there's a lot more there, bit I promised three game changers.I should note, as an aside, that I have a feeling that the Singularity predicted Ray Kurzweil and all of the extropian hopefuls, the whole Rapture of the Nerds, just ain't gonna happen. I have a feeling that we've gone through all the easy stuff, and now we have entered the realm of diminishing returns. Here's a graph to summarize my thoughts, where 1.0 is the the maximum material instrumentality allowed by the laws of physics.  I could be wrong. After all, a hundred years ago, physicists figured all the hard stuff was figured out, and that all future work would just be adding decimal places to precision. So, the next prediction is strictly way out there.Before 2032, a whole new branch of materials science will open up called \"Transmaterials\". Unfortunately for me, the term \"transmaterial\" has already been coined and defined. Too fucking bad. \"Creepsicle\" was also already taken, and that didn't stop me from using it.You've heard of metamaterials? Regular materials behave based on the atoms that make them, like, wood, stone, metals, glass. Metamaterials behave based upon the sum of their parts, like a emergent behavrio not predictable from mere atoms alone. Metamaterials are just getting started, but so far they have been used to make invisibility cloaks, superlenses, optical computers, stuff like that. For my prediction, a transmaterial is a material that alters physical reality, that changes both itself and its environment. It may be that a transmaterial can only make a change within a closed environment, something that will not affect the larger universe (at least, I should hope so), but can still produce amazing effects. In short, a transmaterial can't alter the laws of physics, but it can bend them. My chosen transmaterial is based upon a really cool experiment done last year which may or may not be a landmark experiment. In 2011, scientists coaxed light out of a vacuum. This is a result of one of the predictions that come out of quantum mechanics, which says that the vacuum is empty. It is filled with evanescent virtual particles that are constantly popping in and out of existence over extremely short time periods. (The Casimir effect is another result).  The Chalmers experiment, done by Christopher Wilson and his co-workers, succeeded in getting photons to leave their virtual state and become real photons, i.e. measurable light. The cool thing is, well, here, let me quote the article:\"predicted way back in 1970 that this should happen if the virtual photons are allowed to bounce off a mirror that is moving at a speed that is almost as high as the speed of light. The phenomenon, known as the dynamical Casimir effect, has now been observed for the first time in a brilliant experiment conducted by the Chalmers scientists.“Since it’s not possible to get a mirror to move fast enough, we’ve developed another method for achieving the same effect,” explains Per Delsing, Professor of Experimental Physics at Chalmers. “Instead of varying the physical distance to a mirror, we've varied the electrical distance to an electrical short circuit that acts as a mirror for microwaves.The “mirror” consists of a quantum electronic component referred to as a SQUID (Superconducting quantum interference device), which is extremely sensitive to magnetic fields. By changing the direction of the magnetic field several billions of times a second the scientists were able to make the “mirror” vibrate at a speed of up to 25 percent of the speed of light.“The result was that photons appeared in pairs from the vacuum, which we were able to measure in the form of microwave radiation,” says Per Delsing. “We were also able to establish that the radiation had precisely the same properties that quantum theory says it should have when photons appear in pairs in this way.”What happens during the experiment is that the \"mirror\" transfers some of its kinetic energy to virtual photons, which helps them to materialise. According to quantum mechanics, there are many different types of virtual particles in vacuum, as mentioned earlier. Göran Johansson, Associate Professor of Theoretical Physics, explains that the reason why photons appear in the experiment is that they lack mass.“Relatively little energy is therefore required in order to excite them out of their virtual state. In principle, one could also create other particles from vacuum, such as electrons or protons, but that would require a lot more energy.”\" The point being that (and hopefully you got the jist of the dynamical Casimir effect) is that when you pump more energy into these vibrating \"mirror\"s, the vacuum fluctuations will produce particles. Now, a synchronized bank of these mirrors should produce coherent vacuum fluctuations, basically lasing spacetime. No, this isn't some type of Zero Point Energy bullshit scam that hucksters want to sell you.The device I predict, a spacetime laser, will produce mini-Einstein-Rosen bridges, little teeny tiny wormholes. (And actually, it's probably a lot easier to make wormholes than we imagine - the same way its easy to create nuclear fusion, it's just that you always get less energy out of it than you put in. It's keeping those wormholes stable is where the problem is).Adult Swim's \"Squidbillies\"So, in the scenario I envision, and let's let Doctor Wilson and his colleagues at Chalmers have the honor, is that they set up my predicted apparatus (which must be done in a vacuum chamber), notice that the dial of the vacuum pressure is way, way past what the pumps are capable of, like intergalactic space kind of vacuum. They freak out big time, since they think have created a black hole. Some are afraid to turn the machine off for fear the black hole will sink to the center of the Earth and devour the planet. Others want to shut it off for fear that the black hole is growing. But then they all realize that such a black hole that could create such a vacuum would also create a gravity gradient that would have spaghettified them all to their doom, so Phew! And what the fuck is going on? Eventually, they figure it out. They've created a stable wormhole. They can grow it. Make it big enough for people to go through, and foof! the Universe is ours. Okay, maybe not all ours. I predict the first alien race we run into looks a lot like the Squidbillies from the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. Do I really need to map out those consequences?Okay, last game changer. Wow, after giving you all the larger Universe to play in, this one is kind of a let down. But here goes. Robot swarms. But not killer robot swarms. I know, the killer robot swarms are really easy to make, less than a hundred bucks to make a killer robot swarm that can swoop down and dismantle that neighbor's dog that has been keeping you up at night, but I'm not that kind of person. No really, I try not to do evil things like, or encourage them. I predict friendly helper robot swarms, that can keep track of people, maybe the high risk behavior types, the accident prone, and the just plain unlucky. And since robot swarms use distributed intelligence, the way bees do, which is kind of alien to the way we think, these robot swarms may develop the ability to detect the accident prone behaviors in a predictive way. Maybe some people will just always have a cloud around them. Or maybe, out of the blue, kind of like guardian angels, they just happen to appear in the nick of time. You know, catching rock climbers. Holding opens the jaws of great white sharks to keep surfers from getting chompled. Stuff like that.No, on second thought. No. That's just fucking stupid."},
{"title": "Spencer Tracy Kicks Ass With One Hand!", "date": "Friday, January 13, 2012", "text": "We had our first real snow here in Chicago. I like it when it snows. It allows for the possibility of a penis joke. \"We got four to eight inches last night.\"\"That's what she said.\"\"Four to Eight? That's pretty confused. Hard to do with that range.\" \"Ardor often accounts for imprecision.\"So, anyway, I want to apologize for the last online entry. It really was just a shameless display of public masturbation, and, upon re-reading, actually not particularly interesting in terms of speculative fiction. So, today I was going to write about how much Ron Paul sucks, but, you know, plenty of time and material for that. No, really, Fuck Ron Paul. Why any progressive would back him is a complete mystery. I thought progressives wanted to move forward, and it is a certainty that Paul would have us all move back to the 1890s at the latest.And I also want to discuss whether or not Mitt Romney is a psychopath. he sure looks like it, and he enjoys all the delusions. But, again plenty of time for that later.Instead, since we had a good snow last night, I decided it was a movie night with cold beer and frozen vodka. Oh, yeah. So, I went to the library and came back with the movie \"Bad Day at Black Rock\".Spencer Tracy, Robert Ryan, Anne Francis, Walter Brennan, and both Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin. If you want to play Kevin Bacon, this movie is right next door to \"The Dirty Dozen\".Directed by John Sturges, who also did \"Gunfight at the OK Corral, \"The Magnificent Seven\", \"The Great Escape\", so, a guy who knows how to direct action movies. At the very least, watch Spencer kick Ernie's ass with one hand:http://youtu.be/A2o3QWwwQLI\"Bad Day at Black Rock\" poses as post-WWII film noir, but it's really a Western. Not seen the movie? Fine, I'll spoil it for you, and do it by giving you the behind the scenes narrative without all the suspense and mystery.Spencer Tracy plays a ex-lieutenant who has lost an arm in Italy. A young Japanese-American soldier serving under him died saving Spencer's life. He has traveled to Black Rock, a shitty little Western town, to meet the boy's father, a Mr. Komako, to deliver the medal posthumously awarded to his son.(Presumably, his son was part of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, perhaps even in the legendary 100th Battalion, which had fought in Italy.  So, though the medal is never shown, there is a good chance that it is a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor). Unfortunately for Spencer, Robert Ryan has killed Mr. Komako in a drunken fit of post-Pearl-Harbor bigotry and rage. Other townspeople participated in the lynching (actually, Mr. Komako's house was set afire, and then he was shot trying to escape the flames) and so they are locked in a mutual stranglehold of blackmail and suspicion. The rest of the movie is an unravelling of the coverup, with the townsfolk's intimidation and suspicion of Spencer fueling his own suspicion's of foul play.Now, Spencer receives a lot of intimidation and bullying, but no overt actual violence for much of the movie.  I would argue, under various forms (no force or fraud/no initiation force or fraud) of Libertarian political philosophy, that the townspeople were perfectly justified and ethical in their actions. True, a murder was committed, but the coverup was completely sanctioned under Libertarian tenets.Intimidation, bullying, and threats are neither force or fraud, as they do not engage in any morally questionable overt acts. The threat of violence is not in itself violence. One can argue that a threat is a form of violence, but it can also be viewed as an exchange of information - especially when individual rights to privacy and property are employed - which in the movie, they are.In fact, the townspeople were completely within their rights to treat Spencer the way they do. If anything, it's Spencer who is apply initial coercion by his very presence, since in more than one occasion he attempts a non-consensual use of others' property. And the fact that he initally fails to divulge his purpose for being in town can be viewed as a form of fraud. His reticence is nothing other than a morally questionable ways to get people to do things.In short, this is, yes, a nice little piece of sophistry, and yet, it is exactly the type crap that your average Internet libertard goof engages in.Sophistry, it's what's for dinner!"},
{"title": "State of the World: 2032", "date": "Thursday, January 12, 2012", "text": "Charlie Stross is making predictions. He's considering the years 2032, and 2092.I, like him, have a personal interest in 2032. I'll be 75 that year. If, and there are a large but finite number of ifs involved, I make it to 75, then I'm interested in what people think it will be like. But forget 2092. Unless there are some major flukes coming out of left field, I won't see that time.Reading through his projections, I have to say they are logical, common sense linear projections of a lot of the trends we currently see. In typical Strossian fashion, well-presented, well-thought-out, concise, cogent, and reasonable. They are therefore elegantly, wonderfully wrong.The one thing I would note is there are no disruptive events listed, no game changers, no weird shit out of left field. Because you can trend all you want and be off the mark. Because guessing the weird shit out of left field is what is really going to come close to the mark. In a minute, I'll give you my three game changers for 2032. But before I do that, I'd like to mull over statements from Bruce Sterling.Charlie cites Sterling's and Jon Lebkowsky's comments at the Well  regarding the coming year of 2012 in his entry.I have an ongoing amnesia with the Well. I'll stumble across it, read up a bit, nod my head, make affirmative grunting noises, and then promptly forget about the site until the next time I trip over it. I'd probably read it more often if were a member. But I'm not big on joining things, so, maybe that's why I keep forgetting about the site.Charlie notes that Mr. Sterling is pretty damn good at prognostication. I don't where he stands batting average wise with respect to predictions, but Sterling does seem to notice the interesting future tidbits long before anyone else does. Perhaps the reason for this is Sterling seems adept at getting into other people's heads, and voicing their concerns.  Sterling makes a rather interesting prediction about the near future which is this: \"So I often tell people that the mid-century will be about \"old peoplein big cities who are afraid of the sky.\"  I think that's a prettyuseful, common-sense, plausible assessment.   You may not hear it saidmuch, but it's how things are  turning out.Futurity means metropolitan people with small families in a weathercrisis.\"That's, um, that's pretty much my assessment as well. We'd all like to think things will work out, but the funny is reality is the shit that you least expect. So Bruce may be right and wrong here.Speaking of getting into heads, I'd also like to draw particular attention to another portion he wrote:SOME FRINGE BELIEFS ABOUT FUTURE CHANGESIt's surprising how little vitality these have nowadays.  Instead offanaticallly dedicating themselves to narrow, all-explanatory cults,people just sort of eyeblink at 'em and move on to the next similiartopic.  In a true Network Society, all fringe beliefs about the futureseem to be more or less equivalent, like Visa, American Express andMastercard.  \"Conservatism\" conserves nothing; there is no\"progression\" in which to progress.Peak Oil.  Oil probably \"peaked\" quite some time ago, but the \"peak\"itself doesn't seem to bother markets much. The imaginary Armageddongot old-fashioned fast. Peak Oil has peaked.Islamic Caliphate...  With the collapse of so many Arab regimes, theseguys are in the condition of dogs that caught a taxi.  \"Sharia Law\" ispractically useless for any contemporary purpose, and Arabs neveragree about anything except forcing non-Arabs to believe.  Chemtrails.  These guys are pitiable loons, but they're interestingharbingers of a future when even scientific illiterates are deathlyafraid of the sky.  It's interesting that we have cults of people whowalk outside and read the sky like a teacup.   I've got a soft spot forchemtrail people, they're really just sort of cool, and much moreinteresting than UFO cultists, who are all basically Christians.  Jesusis always the number one Saucer Brother in UFO contactee cults.  It'sincredible how little imagination the saucer people have.BitCoin.  An ultimate Internet hacker fad.  You'd think they wereencrypting food and shelter, what with the awesome enthusiasm they hadfor this abstract scheme.Space Travel people.  Visible mostly by their absence nowadays.  Aboutthe only ones left are nutcase one-percenters of a certain generation,with money to burn on their private space yachts.  This was such ahuge narrative of the consensus future, for such a long time, that it'sreally interesting to see it die in public.   There's no popularunderstanding of why space cities don't work, though if you told themthey'd have to spend the rest of their lives in the fuselage of a 747at 30,000 feet, they'd be like \"Gosh that's terrible.\"Transcendant spiritual drug enthusiasts.  People consume unbelievableamounts of narcotics nowadays, but there used to be gentle, unworldlycharacters who genuinely thought this practice was good for you, andwould give you marijuana and psychedelics because they were convincedthey were doing you a big, life-changing favor.   You go into one of those medical marijuana dispensaries nowadays,they're like huckster chiropractors, basically.  The wholeethical-free-spirit surround of the psychedelic dreamtime is gone. It's like the tie-dyed guys toking up in the ashram have been replacedby the carcasses of 12,000 slaughtered Mexicans.Nuclear Armageddon enthusiasts.  Kind of a flicker-of-interest forthis around Iran right now.  Nothing compared to the colossal culturalinfluence that this paradigm once commanded.  The WMD invasion of Iraq,kind of the last hurrah for this, it's tragedy redone as farce.  You show somebody a Dr Strangelove mushroom cloud these days, they'relike, \"What is that, Fukushima?  I don't get it.\"I could go on about other people's futurisms.  Doing Italy and Serbiais tempting. But despite the variegated change-drivers that theseinterest-groups imagine, I remain pretty sure that all these groups areheading for a future world where they're elderly, urbanized and afraidof the sky.   Even if you believe in reptiloids, you're gonna be areptiloid-believing guy in a pretty big town with a lot of yourneighbors pushing walkers in a heat wave.\" Hilarious, and also spot-on in almost every category, says I. So, my predictions for 2032, using the same categories Charlie does:Climate: Global warming denialism will have gone the way of all delusions, joining the Flat Earthers, Young Earth Creationists, Mormons, Scientologists, Objectivists, etc (see above). Mainly not because things got hot - though they will - but because things got so hot and so extreme and so weird so damned fast. Many now wish they had coined the term \"global weirding\" instead of \"global warming\". Doesn't matter. My game changer is the climate trends accelerate, and what world conditions were predicted for around 2100 will have gone through a transition by perhaps as early as 2014, and no later than 2022. That means an ice free Arctic Ocean, super hurricanes, unprecedented tornado events like Mississippi and Alabama last year. I actually don't think the tropical climes heat up all that much. That's concentrated at the higher latitudes. Torrential rains (dozens of inches in a day), decade long droughts, and sea level rise of, oh what the hell, 15 meters over the next decade. Bye bye Florida and most cities.Energy: Same as before. Fossil fuels are out there, they will be used, and they will be extracted. Oh, sure, the current downward trend in solar PV will accelerate, lots of people will switch over. My bet is that natural gas will be the way to go, only because we can get the oil companies to cooperate on that front (meaning they got the tech, infrastructure and assured continued obscene profits). Peak oil did peak already, but all that does is make the difficult extractive processes affordable. Which means your best bet is to leave that oil in the ground until cheaper and more efficient methods of extraction come online. In other words, its rather stupid to use proven reserves. The alternative? My game changer: room temperature superconductors are developed. That means a revolution in power transmission, and a revolution in energy storage, and all electric vehicles with incredibly dangerous batteries in them. Solar farms will spout up all over the place, and extreme weather will mean there will be a big, big maintenance budget for them. Wind power, hydro, nukes, yeah, yeah they'll be there. Fusion, as usual, will be thirty years in the future.Transport: Fossil fuel vehicles will still be around, certainly in the developing world, and for hobbyists, forever. Oh sure, lots of cute little electric cars, and trucks, and trains. Jets? Ships? Hmmm. Old skool fuel, and maybe carbon neutral synthetic fossil fuels, with hydrogen made via sunshine, and CO2 extracted from the atmosphere.Population: Peak at nine billion, then a crash. Not necessarily where or when you think. China, Japan, Russia, Europe get old and shrink. India, Africa, South America, vibrantly young and growing. The US, surprisingly, through immigration and good old-fashioned humping, maintains a relatively young population. I predict no game changers. Any game changer translates as a massive die-off. If such happens, then been there done that. Boring. Moving on.Politics: Oh, that's all too depressing. Next category.Space: Not much. Lots of robot probes. China goes to the Moon and never goes back. Maybe some commercial launches, but, as usual, without some reason to go out there, nobody goes out there. I do predict eventual nuclear rockets, but not for a long, long time.Food: Soylent Green. Now with more people! Electronics: Maybe graphene. Maybe spintronics. Maybe optical computers. But I agree with Charlie, there's not much play left in Moore's Law. Doesn't mean we won't have even cooler gadgets, but we hit a wall at something, but something that would still make your average plugged-in geek of today shit their pants.The internet: Aside from a few late-adopting hermits like me, absolutely everyone knows absolutely everything about absolutely everything and everyone on the planet, and we still don't know how to behave.Medicine: In the US, healthcare will be out of reach for the average citizen. I think most everything will be curable, but unaffordable. You will start to see average life expectancy decline - unless you are rich.  You will see diseases return that have not been prevalent since the early part of 20th century. This isn't a glum dystopian vision, this is an extrapolation of current trends in healthcare. What's to be done in the US? Hm. Socialized medicine, maybe? The current system is destined to fail. Worldwide? Oh, bad. But better than the US - even in Africa.That's about it. Were I betting man, I would say every single prediction is wrong. Except the room temperature superconducting materials. And if that happens, well literally, all bets are off."},

{"title": "\"The End of Loser Liberalism\": A Review", "date": "Monday, January 9, 2012", "text": "(For those of you who would prefer a less-meandering and better-crafted review of Dean Baker's e-book (available as a free PDF here), read Jared Bernstein's much more concise and spot on essay, Loser Liberalism is a Winner).Like it or not, politics is the prime mover of human affairs. It is the water in which we swim. We make war, wage peace, trade goods, starve babies, live in filth, wallow in unparalleled splendor, visit other worlds, all within the frame of reference of politics. It is a withering observation, an unsettling judgement as to the fundamental insanity of our species that this should be so.The one thing we do not recognize, or should recognize more often, is that this frame of reference is not fixed or constant, that the Natural Order of the political landscape is wholly manufactured and artificial, and can be change. And by this I mean, most fundamentally our way of looking at things, what is called the \"framing of the political debate\" is based upon something as cobbled together as public relations.In America, currently, we will see one of a myriad of scenarios playing between two extremes over the next year.On the one extreme, Obama is re-elected as President, inertia from the campaign keeps Republican gains in the Senate to a minimum, and sees losses in the House due to public disaffection with the Tea Party faction of the Republican party. The Republicans recognize the slim but real chance of this occurring, which is why they are holding meetings in Texas to prevent a balkanization of the party, and a convergence around someone who is palatable to all. The fortunate consequence of this extreme scenario would be the end of gridlock, and some forward momentum in getting things done. The unfortunate consequence would be the resurgence of party agenda, as happened in 2008, and 2010, when, in both cases public opinion was tragically misinterpreted.The other extreme unfolds with Romney being elected as Commander-in-Chief, the Republicans achieving a Senate majority, and losses in the House due to public disaffection with the Tea Party faction of the Republican party kept to a minimum. The fortunate consequence of this scenario is... wow, I can't think of one. But it involves one big Do-Over. Given the Republican's tendency to favor the status quo, and do nothing at all, or as little as possible, the best case scenario is that the nation gets a Reset to 2009, and then continues to bump along the ground until the next economic bubble appears. Then we go through another period of false prosperity, followed by a crisis and crash, as we have been doing for some thirty years now. The good news is we should all be used to it. The bad news is, well, the rich get richer, and the middle class, working class, and the poor continue to get fucked. Or at least until 2016 or so, when China overtakes us as the number one economy (some predict sooner). After that, all bets are off.The unfortunate consequence of the scenario is something along the lines of a continuation of the 2010 Republican agenda - austerity, privitization of public institutions, and a scaling back of all restraints on the private sector, which pretty much guarantees a contraction of the economy, and most likely a Depression until 2020, or when China overtakes us, when all bets are off. Or when Mitt Romneys' People (read: the people that matter, large multi-national corporations), finally subsume us all into a vast autocratic propertarian utopia, with electronic devices in all our heads.Of course, all of this is public relations to hide the actual conservation agenda, which is to benefit the rich by stacking the economic deck to promote massive upward redistribution of resources.  You have to admit, in this public relations game, conservatives have been remarkably successful. Which is what Dean Baker's book, and I promise I will eventually get to that.In looking at the above two extremes, my suspicion is that something in between will happen, unless, of course, public attitudes change. We have seen public attention directed towards this upward distribution of wealth thanks to the Occupy Wall Street movement. Paul Krugman, John Quiggin, and Jared Bernstein have also extensively commented upon this, but much more should be done. Even ordinary citizens are now expressing concerns about the ongoing \"trickle-down\" economics of the right, and the building evidence that income inequality stifles equality of opportunity and social mobility.So, finally to Mr. Baker's book. Well, actually, not quite. For a slim 155 pages, Mr. Baker covers a lot of ground. One important piece of information I should mention is his covering of the manufactured recessions and bubble driven economy which we've had over the past thirty years. I've always had a suspicion that, after the real growth of the Long Boom (ca 1945 - 1976), we have been living in a period of false prosperity. Everything has been done to keep growth going, but the inherent flaws of capitalism, with its requirement of a compounded 3% growth per annum, virtually guarantee that this is not only unsustainable but unrealistic. Therefore, artificial booms have been required, similar to sugar highs that inevitably result in a blood sugar crash. With this in mind...The book. Rather than me tell you, here's from the jacket blurb:\"Most people define the central point of dispute between liberals and conservatives as being that liberals want the government to intervene to bring about outcomes that they consider fair, while conservatives want to leave things to the market. This is not true. Conservatives actually rely on the government all the time, most importantly in structuring the market in ways that ensure that income will flow upwards. The framing that \"conservatives like the market while liberals like government\" puts liberals in the position of seeming to want to tax the winners to help the losers. This \"loser liberalism\" is bad policy and horrible politics. The efforts of liberals would be better spent on battles over the structure of markets so that they don't redistribute income upward. This book describes some key areas in which progressives can focus their efforts to restructure markets so that income flows to the bulk of the working population rather than just a small elite\".So, what are the two main governmental mechanisms the rich use to game the market? The Fed, and the Treasury department.After Panic of 1907, when JP Morgan bailed out the federal government, Congress in 1913 created the Federal Reserve system. Conservatives will claim that the Fed was pure progressive evil by allowing private banks to control the currency. But the purpose of the Fed, in \"immediate\" response to the Panic, was to set up a central banking system to control and stabilize federal currency through a system of interbank lending and the setting of interest rates. It was set up to be purposely undemocratic by removing all processes from congressional and executive oversight (thus avoiding, among other things, graft, corruption, conflict of interest and the whims and fancies of populace). The purpose of Fed is twofold, two , as it turns out, conflicting functions: stabilize prices, and achieve maximum employment. The Fed is primarily a service to the banking industry, and as such, price stability is always, or almost always, it's primary concern. The Fed can actually do little to influence a stimulation of the economy, but its main trick is to lower interest rates, which is great for banks, making lending easier, and rent-seeking (e.g. banks charge much much higher rates to lend money than what they borrow from the government) more profitable. On the other hand, the Fed is much, much better at putting on the brakes by raising interest rates. And when you raise interest rates, you slow down the economy, put people out of work, reduce wages, keep prices low, and asset values high. Not surprisingly, rich people love the Fed. Can the Fed be used to help the employment picture? Well, ever since Volker, the stated goal of the Fed is to keep inflation at no more than 2%. But as Baker points out, there is little evidence that even modest inflation of 3-4% causes any serious harm to the economy. The right-wing flying monkeys descended upon Chairman Bernanke in the initial stages of the financial crisis when the monetary supply was expanded. They predicted runaway inflation, and successfully shut down any further stimulus. Prices in fact did not skyrocket:\"With massive amounts of idle capacity in almost every sector of the economy and an extraordinarily high unemployment rate, the conditions did not exist for inflation to take off. Furthermore, there had been prior instances in which central banks had vastly expanded a country's core money supply during severe slumps, most obviously the Fed during the Great Depression and Japan's central bank in the 1990s. In both cases the money went to excess reserves, since banks faced no demand for loans in a depressed economy. Inflation did result. However unrealistic they may have been, the complaint by the right had their intended result. They bolstered inflation hawks on the Fed and almost certainly made Chairman Bernanke and other relative doves more cautious about pushing expansionary monetary policy\".In short, thank you asshole Republicans, for unnecessarily prolonging the recession. And thank you, spineless Democrats, for not aggressively complaining that the Fed was taking inadequate steps to fulfill that portion  of the congressional mandate encouraging full employment.Baker recommends a bit more accountability and transparency regarding the Fed's favoring the nation's banks and bankers. Surprisingly, legislation was passed, sponsored by Congressmen Ron Paul, Alan Grayson, and Bernie Sanders, to make details of loan information public. True, the monies handed out were a conscious effort on the part of the Fed to dilute the amount of toxic assets the bank's creditors held, in order to make them profitable again, but at what cost?Baker also covers the US Treasury and its long-standing attempts to keep the dollar strong. The Treasury can intervene directly in currency markets by buying or selling dollars, though it uses this power infrequently. But the strength of the dollar has a major impact on not only the unemployment rate, but also on which workers become unemployed and how much employed workers earn. Starting with Robert  Rubin under Clinton, using the Asian banking crisis as the opportunity, Rubin has built up the dollar against other foreign currencies. Who benefits from this?A strong dollar increases the size of out nations trade imbalance, as foreign goods are cheaper to import, and our own manufactured goods are more expensive to export. So consumers - those who have jobs - benefit with cheaper shoddy goods from, say, China (at the expense of domestic manufacturing jobs). The financial industry benefits in two ways:\"First, by making imports cheaper, a high dollar helps to keep inflation low, and stable prices are a financial industry obsession. Second, when the financial industry looks to move abroad, its dollar assets go much further when the dollar is overvalued.\"You would think manufacturers would be opposed to a strong dollar, but then: \"Domestic manufacturers should oppose a high dollar since it places them at a disadvantage relative to foreign competitors. However, insofar as manufacturers are able to establish operations overseas, they are likely to be content with a high-dollar policy that disadvantages only some of their operations. Because they can shield themselves with foreign operations, they can gain advantage over purely domestic competitors\".So apparently a weaker dollar would benefit that segment of the US work force that relies on wages alone for income, not so much for the professional and ruling classes.So-called free trade agreements further erode the working and middle classes, by encouraging manufacturers to relocate outside of the US. One wonders how the upper income brackets would feel if similar foreign competition occurred for their professions. Baker explores the idea of foreign competition for doctors, lawyers, business administrators, trust-fund managers, engineers, computer programmers, etc., but this suggestion seems unrealistic and untenable. One can hope, should one wish wages and benefits for the higher income brackets to be lowered to less obscene levels, that sophisticated automation will give them a run for their monies. This type of healthy free market competition would surely lower wages and benefits, freeing up monies to go back into general circulation, probably in an impact several tens of times the expiration of the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy, as it is well known that salaries, no matter who gets them, are a cost to everyone else. I doubt this will happen. Opening up the job market at the upper echelons sounds like something that would be strictly opposed, so, moving on...The rich have really pulled a number on us. There's a lot more stuff, but, read the book. I ti s ironic that so many of Baker's progressive solutions involve, what do you know, leveling the playing field to allow for real competition.  In summary, just so you get the idea, I'll end with a quote Baker's from final chapter: \"The enormous growth of inequality over the last three decades did not come about as a result of the natural workings of the market; it came through conscious design. The job of progressives is to point this out in every venue and in every way we can. It is not by luck, talent, and hard work that the rich are getting so much richer. It is by rigging the rules of the game.\""},
{"title": "Indiana and the \"Right to Work\"", "date": "Friday, January 6, 2012", "text": "\"A lot of smart, young men have come out of Indiana - and the smarter they were, the faster they left\" - attributed to Mark TwainI really shouldn't, but I've a nostalgia for Indiana. It is, without a doubt, a primitive, benighted realm, populated with proudly ignorant troglodytes, and yet, it was once my home, and I would go back.No small part of the nostalgia is a love of the land. I was fortunate to be raised up in Northwest Indiana. The middle third of the state is flat as a griddle, an unremitting and wearisome monotony, with only the sky for respite. In cloudless summers, or overcast winters, one feels like a bacterium wedged between glass layers on a microscope slide. There is just an overwhelming and paradoxical sense of agoraphobic claustrophobia. Wrist-slitting country.Little wonder then, before the age of mass communications, the inhabitants resorted to sexual escape - rural perversions and incestuous burrowing on a pandemic scale. And out there alone on the prairie, if you want to bugger your kin, who is going to know? Who is there to tell? Ick. Ugh.Things were better where I grew up. To the immediate north was Lake Michigan, and the Indiana Dunes. Great for summers, when the refreshing relief of those waters to the positively Amazonian conditions of the Midwest cannot adequately be described or imagined, but only experienced. Running down the vast sand dunes in thousand league boots - again, an experience that a paltry imagining cannot compare to.Nice, huh?The glaciers of the last Ice Age had dumped a great deal of Ontario in a region of hills and valleys known as the Valparaiso morraine. There are all sorts of dark gullies, deep sandy kettle lakes, mossy streams, and tree covered knolls to explore - secret hidden places that were, yes, even to a godless heathen such as yours truly, magical, mystical, and sacred. Real magic. Nature's magic. And I didn't even need to be stoned to recognize it.Ah, but the people? You know, if Ohio still wears a bowler hat and chews on dime cigars, then Indiana wears a straw boater and spats. It's completely fucked, and living there, unfortunately, means receiving a mandatory lethal injection of conservative political RNA into your system. I've managed to avoid most of the consequences of that. Which is why I find the current Indiana Assembly's attempts to pass so-called \"Right to Work\" laws so repugnant.There is, of course, nothing about any employee rights in the \"right to work\" law. The purpose is to reduce union funding, and also to encourage lower wages for employees. And, given the current economic straits Indiana workers find themselves in, they would be in a difficult position to complain.Federal laws stipulate unions must represent anyone with a grievance that happens to be employed in the same company. Under Indiana's proposed legislation, companies and unions would be banned from negotiating a contract that requires non-members to pay fees for the representation the union must provide to all employees of a bargaining unit. In other words, the union must represent an aggrieved employee, but receive no compensation. This is basically a version of \"taxation without representation\".Republicans cite high unemployment in Indiana and an incentive for businesses to locate here, much the same way as Southern states have encouraged employment with less-than-quality jobs in a \"race to the bottom\" wage fuck.Problem is, its the Republican administration's fault that the employment picture is so shitty. Mitch Daniels, the so-called \"cerebral\" governor of Indiana (and the choice of many right-wing politicians and pundits for Presidential candidate) was, just a short year ago, being praised for the state's budget surplus. As it turns out, those budget numbers were not completely kosher.Early in Daniels' first term, made improving jobs and income one of his most important goals. So, how is Indiana doing? Income growth has been negative. Indiana lags the nation. In 2002, Indiana ranked 33rd in the nation. Under Daniels, in 2010, Indiana ranked 41st. How about jobs? Well, while the rest of country saw unemployment rates reduced or at least hold steady, Indiana lost jobs. In fact, it's been only in the past six months that Indiana unemployment rates have held steady.I think we have to rate Governor Daniels with a massive FAIL.(And keep in in mind, Daniels is the guy that Romney is ready a job to, \"any job\". Pity Daniels doesn't feel the same way about his constituents).Okay, was that parenthesized statement fair? Yeah, I think so. Daniels had it within his power to do a number to not only \"create\" jobs, but quality jobs. That \"balanced\" budget of his could have been used for Keynesian stimuli (and please, don't give that crap that it doesn't work. It works.) He could have offered skills programs, shared work hours, educational grants, infrastrucutre projects, all kinds of things that would have put his precious state budget in the red.So, ultimately, I can't take Daniels seriously. Neither does Krugman. 'Nuff said."},

{"title": "Space is the Place", "date": "Wednesday, January 4, 2012", "text": "For starters, score one for Kurman's prediction registry. Ekso Bionics has developed an exoskeleton for the disabled. Though not quite ready for street use, Ekso is set to sell the suit to rehab clinics in America and Europe. Not much of a prediction, given that, as I observed in this essay, the real market for powered exoskeleton suits is in the limited mobility field. Still, nice to see a worthwhile application outside of the usual bonehead Republican crush/kill/destroy type of applications.Speaking of bonehead Republicans, I detected a gassy little whine emanating from the too-real-to-be-a-parody-but-oh-how-they-try Investors' Business Daily, the media version of  exoskeleton for the limited thinking and intellectually impaired. Andrew Malcolm, who looks like he needs an Ekso Bionic suit to get around, and also is probably overdue for some radical surgical intervention of excess fecal buildup, laments that the Chinese are going to the Moon while the US has to rent seats on rickety old Russian spacecraft. And obviously, it's All Obama's Fault. Right? He canceled the aging white elephant shuttle fleet with nothing to replace it, like the Orion capsule and the Heavy Lift Launch System. Oops. Wait, Andrew. That's going to happen. Are you lying? Or just conveniently forgetful?But hey, Andrew, twas Obama that gutted federal funding for the NASA, basic federal R&D funding, funding for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education programs, right? Right? Not the Teatards. It's all Obama's fault that science and education funding, the greatest economic engine in the nation, creating more than half of all new jobs, will be stifled. Andrew, you are a fucking asshole. But then, that's what you are paid for.Let's ignore the federal subsidies to private aerospace companies like SpaceX and Orbital. Although, Andrew probably views federal subsidies as a bad thing, like, for example, the Defense Department's subsidizing the microchip industry to use in missiles. That boondoggle never panned out, did it, Andrew?Let's ignore that SpaceX is sending a commercial flight to the ISS this Feb. 7th. Or that Orbital is set to launch in May. Or that Paul Allen is getting into the space business with a space plane.And who was it that killed Apollo? Too expensive they said. $25 billion in one-time development cost, to develop an entirely new industry, and then just drop the whole thing after a few moon shots. Nixon. A Republican administration. Figures.Hey, remember Skylab? That was put up with a modified Saturn 1B. That was built by, who built that? Oh that's right. Chrysler built that. Let that sink in for a minute. Here, this will help:FUCKING CHRYSLER BUILT THAT!!!THAT was 195,000 pounds in low earth orbit, four times the Shuttle's cargo capacity. That launch set the US of A back 170 million smackers. And if we work that out, that's $870/lb. And the Shuttle was, what? $5000 - 10,000 / lb.No School like Old Skool.Had we continued a post Apollo program as planned, which was to not only keep Skylab in orbit, but greatly expand it's size and scope, we could have had not only a ISS station about ten times the size of the current one, amortized the cost of the space program with continued missions to a commerial level, brought launch costs within the $100/lb range, and probably have kept a lot of people in Detroit busy building space rockets.What a fucking waste.Well, it's not too late.  But, now what we really need (since we have so many people working on the Earth to LEO problem), is a really good nuclear engine, like NERVA. Yeah, Okay, I'd take a fusion thruster also.Yeah, what happened to that?"},
{"title": "Panspermia (continued)", "date": "Friday, December 23, 2011", "text": "Happy 2012. And good riddance to 2011. I don't know about you, but I'm happy to see that year slip down the lightcone. I can't remember which physicist said it, but the joke is \"The future is all waves, the past becomes particles\". Meaning quantum mechanically, I'd just as soon 2011 had been particle-ized from the getgo.  This is not to say I look forward to 2012, but the one thing that can be said for 2012 is that it isn't 2011.  Not that the year was all terrible for me. Me, personally, I'd say I just marked time through it all. That in and of itself is kind of terrible. For others, it really was a bad, tough year.I honestly don't know if 2011 could have been better particle-ized. Perhaps, in some other universe, in some Everett many-worlds multiverse, it all particle-ized quite well.(But keep in mind that the true interpretation of Everett's quantum choices is not you making choices and splitting the universe up. It's not like a version of Nick the Bartender in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" handing out angel's wings with a cash register bell. It's not like Sheldon Leonard is flipping a coin saying \"Dig Me! I'm creatin' univoises!\" It may sound pedantic, but the universe is all that is, all matter, all energy, all spaces and times. It is merely a contemporary cultural conceit that we refer to multiverses. If the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, then all that happens when you make choice is that you get split into different versions of you. But no new universes are created. You just aren't that fucking important. Get over yourself).Speaking of different regions of space and time beyond our apprehension, we really need to address the idea of just the one Big Bang. We, in our conceit, assume that we see is all there is. When, in fact, most cosmologists would say that the universe is much, much bigger than just the 13.7 billion light year radius of stuff around us that we see. Some say the universe is infinite in size, others put it at 150 billion light years.What's wrong with this picture?Don't how they come up with that number. I suspect the number is based upon cosmic microwave background data. Also on the principle of mediocrity, that conditions we enjoy are the same everywhere. Again, I consider that principle a kind conceit, making the assumption that there aren't strange and bizarre corners of the universe that play by different rules. And include in that conceit the idea that there was only the one Bang.But it could be that our observable universe is only a recent thing, just a baby thing, just an effervescent pocket of new shit. There may be parts much, much older than we what we see.  In a previous essay, I calculated that, just using natural processes and some astonishingly good luck, that bacteria from Earth could travel to a potential new planetary home circling our nearest star in a mere few tens of thousands of years.  31,461 years to be exact. And, assuming some astoundingly amazing luck, the whole galaxy could have been colonized with Earth life. The chances are exceedingly remote, nigh on impossible, but not quite. And that's assuming a mere 3.5 billion years of known life, with random events and trajectories through natural accident.More purposeful travels, which is to say artificial means such von Neumann self-replicating space probes traveling at some fraction of the speed of light, containing a software blueprint of life and the means to synthesize biology upon arrival (all reasonable and doable assumptions given even our present state of primitive technologies) puts the time frame for full galactic colonization at a paltry two million years.  In fact, all the data, and all our logic, suggest that we are not unique, we should not not be alone. Life should be every fucking where. And yet we have no evidence for it. The Fermi Paradox.What about other places? What's the absolute best-case scenario? Well, we will use the Milky Way galaxy, as all the astronomical evidence suggests this galaxy formed early on at the beginning of the universe. So, some structures of the galaxy as old as the universe, 13.7 billion years. Other parts, like the halo of old, tired stars, the supermassive black hole at the center, and cold dark nebulae, are slightly younger, but not by much. If we grant some very fortunate circumstances, and assume (because we have no other example) that life is defined as our kind of life (carbon-based, aqueously mediated, planetary bounded), then it works out like this:image courtesy Indiana UBig Bang. Inflation. Expansion. Particle creation and nuclear fusion.75% hydrogen, 24.99% helium. Trace of lithium.First stars with this composition, hundreds of times the mass of the sun, get started some 100,000 years later, live hard, die fast, churn out metals (astronomical metals - anything heavier than hydrogen and helium).Surrounding space is filled up with gas and dust with the ingredients for life, namely hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur for starters. If you want RNA or DNA, throw in phosphorous. If you want life that doesn't have to worry about hard radiation, throw in iron, for an iron core for an electromagnetic shield around the planet.The first generation of stars are hazardous to life. The second generation of stars, made from the stuff spewed out by the first, might have planetary bodies around them, but do not have sufficient heavier elements for life. Third generation of stars includes our sun, start popping up around nine to 5 billion years ago. So, the earliest life goes back two to three billion years before Earth life got its start. So goes the conventional narrative.But we are talking about best case scenario. It is possible for a star forming region to concentrate all the stuff you need for a sunlike system with earthlike planets with sufficient heavy metals as early as twelve billion years ago. So, some eight billion years before us, or twice the lifetime of life on Earth.  And that's the best case for the observable universe. But as I said, this could be new pocket. There could be parts of our universe that vastly older, or even parts that are no longer around, or have undergone a Big Crunch, or even more horrifying a Big Runaway in which accelerating expansion rips apart everything into a cold thin soup of nothingness.So, want a tragedy? Ninety trillion years ago, a far distant part of the universe erupted in a big bang. It developed fast, much faster than out in our neck of the woods. And in the short span of just a few million years, there was a stellar splendor. And life developed. It grew complex. Then intelligent. Then technological. And this smart capable life looked around its observable part of the universe, and recognized that it was expanding. And to this life's horror, the expansion was accelerating. So much so that soon everything would be cold thin soup. And life set about trying counter this. But life couldn't do it. There wasn't enough mass and energy available, even if they gathered all they could see together in one spot, there own Big Crunch. Not that they didn't try. But they realized that even black holes would evaporate against the coming runaway inflation.                  How They Did ItSo they tried escape. They built wormholes, while there was a still a chance. But to their despair, the mouths of these wormholes always bottomed out within more cold, more darkness, more emptiness. Finally, half insane in desperation, with the very last of their resources, they rotated their local space with their remaining wormholes, and thus constructed a time machine, so that at least they could escape to the past, back to their warm stellar age. Instead, they leapt beyond the confines of their prison, into the larger universe, and there they found a new beginning. And though they were fruitful and multiplied, they were still mad and scarred from their harrowing past, and determined never, ever to let it happen again. And any life they found was raw materials to them, or, if lucky, cannon fodder. They are out there. But it's best if they don't know about you.So, shhh! Keep quiet!"},
{"title": "Plan F", "date": "Wednesday, December 21, 2011", "text": "If procrastination was a virtue worthy of an aristocratic title, my family would be royalty.Well, I'm crafting a Xmas present for my niece. She likes doors. She doesn't have any doors. So I'm making her a door.I guess I should explain. She does have large doors. Regular life-sized doors. She doesn't have small quaint crafty doors, as in knick-knack doors, little curio doors, if there even is such a thing.So, I told her I would make her a little door to get her collection started. You know how it goes, once someone starts a collection, people give them things, and that's how you walk into houses that have lots of metal owls, or ceramic frogs, or some kind of collection of things.Well, the making of the door, which I figured would be a piece of cake, is taking ten times as long as I had planned. For starters, I decided to use some scrap walnut I had. It was very seasoned, meaning really dried out and done warping and bending and twisting and all the shit that wood does once you kill it. It was really nice walnut, until I cut into it with power tools. The power tools just chewed it all right up to an alarming degree. The table saw splintered the crap out of it, even when I did an initial cut across the grain with an Xacto blade to keep it from splintering. The router table chewed into it as if it were balsa wood, so much so that I was a little worried for my fingertips.So, I was reduced to using hand tools. Which means the elaborate Plan A I had intended for it, with lots of fancy Roman ogee molding and separate panels and a kind of a Barbie Dream Palace look to it all, gave up the ghost. All that shit went right out the window. When was the last time you attempted crafting a molding with a hand planer instead of an electric router? Thought so. Me too. King of the Wood People So, Plan B was dropped as soon as I inventoried all the unmutilated remaining wood. I would have to scale the design down. Which meant the bronze fittings I had cast would no longer work as they were now oversized. So, off to the hardware store to purchase hinges and something that would as a door handle for the new Plan C door design. Oops, wait! I was supposed to incorporate a small key into the mix that my sister-in-law gave me which had some childhood significance to my niece. So, on to Plan D. Quickly made a new fitting out of bronze, cast it, drilled a keyhole in it, and substituted the key and lock for the door handle.Glued and ClampedThen, cutting the frame for the door, it turns out the sculpture and design students had somehow fucked up the miter saw and not bothered to inform me. So, a mitered frame is out of the picture.Now we are at Plan E, which is just a square frame, a plain door, hardware store hinges, no handle, but the key and lock act as the handle. And I have just now glued it up.Taking a break here to write all this up while the first coat of tung oil soaks.I will finish it with tung oil and butcher's wax tomorrow. This is the Plan F door. And it looks like a goddamn Fred Flintstone door.-\"it's a place right out of his-tor-y!\"She's getting it anyway!Plan G would have involved a visit to Hobby Lobby, buy a doll house, trash it except for the little door, and say \"Merry Fucking Christmas. Here's your goddamn present\"."},
{"title": "Panspermia", "date": "Thursday, December 15, 2011", "text": "I recently consumed little piece of hard holiday candy on The Fermi Paradox, Self-Replicating Probes, and the Interstellar Transportation Bandwidth.It's a fun little paper about interstellar colonization, vonNeumann self-replicating machines, and why the heck aren't we knee deep in inquisitive and curious alien life forms? At one very brief point, the idea of panspermia is broached, in the sense of we-have-met-the-aliens-and-they-is-us solution to the Fermi Paradox, but the treatment last about as long as this sentence. And why should it? I mean, the paper itself is informed speculation, but for hard answers? Why, the standard excuse, into the foreseeable future is, Insufficient Data.But what the heck, let's think about it a little bit. And for my object lesson, I choose the movie Starship Troopers. Now, most people would say \"Oh my goodness why? That's a horrible movie. Why would you choose that for your speculative background?\" And then, of course, there is the objection from the humorless little prig known as the Heinlein fan, who views the movie as an awful perversion of the book. Well, director Paul Verhoeven knew what he was doing. He presented a perfect fascist society of the future and showed that the only thing a perfect fascist society of the future was good for was killing alien Bugs. Not to mention, Verhoeven directed Showgirls, Robocop, and Total Recall, so the charge of taking things over the top is, at best, to identify yourself as a cluelessly humorless little prig. Besides, Heinlein book does serve a useful purpose. For those with a healthy and mature mental metabolism, it serves as a vaccine to Ayn Rand's wretched works.Anyway, I'd argue that the alien Bugs in that movie provide a very good example of panspermia. I mean, we actually told in that movie that they have the ability to colonize other planets by \"hurling their spore into space\". To those geeks that object to this method as haphazard and inefficient, I'd suggest a scuba dive during the full moon when the coral reefs are spawning. The water is thick with eggs and sperm, which should freak most geeks out, and the chances of all that milky organic stuff turning into a new coral reef are frighteningly small.  (As an aside, a very nice visual aside at that, movie credits go out to Starship's Allen Cameron, Bruce Robert Hill, and Steve Wolff for the production design and art direction. In a wonderfully concise and clever group of visual hints, the viewer is invited to do a little creative world-building to figure out just how the Bugs can spread throughout the galaxy. First, there are the Bugs themselves who, through their exoskeletons and rigid hive society, seem queerly preadapted to life in the harsh environment of space. Second, those monstrously huge plasma bugs are shown shooting blue fire out of their butts right up into orbit to harass and destroy human starships above their home planet of Klendathu. Third, an explosion of one human starship releases warp plasma, the stuff that allows FTL travel, which is the exact same color as the bug plasma. In short, we are provided with a rationalization as to how the bugs spread through space. Bug colonies, on asteroids, propelled by big bug ass plasma at superluminal speeds. Interesting, at the very least, how this alien society does with adapted organic life, what we humans do with our technologies).Alright, you know what? Clearly this essay is not going to be a serious attempt at discussing panspermia. I mean, your'e lucky it's only now that I snigger at the \"sperm\" part of it.Sperm. Heh.But I'll tell you what.  I'll take a brief crack at it. Starship Troopers was a movie. So, let's get \"real\" for a sec. Is panspermia possible without violating the laws of physics? Well, clearly if we play by the rules, the speed of light cannot be violated.  So, let's give the Bugs a moment of respite, and talk about bugs. As in bacteria.If there is any life on Earth that might survive a voyage through space without technological assistance, it would be bacteria. Recall the brief period of excitement back in 1996, when it was believed microbial fossils were found in a piece of meteorite? It was dubbed ALH84001, a chunk of Mars that had landed in Antarctica 16 million years ago. Let's send a bacterium from the Earth to the nearest star. Assume bacteria are well insulated within a rock from an event catastrophic enough to propel them into orbit. That's 7 mi/sec or 25,000 miles per hour minimum. That's a formidable event, itself undoubtedly an asteroid or comet impact upon the surface of the Earth.Further assume that the bacteria are hardy enough to survive the journey by being flash frozen into cryogenic suspension, and that the rock protects them from the ravages of hard radiation (the number one space hazard for organic life). Given that some bacterial spores have been revived from a dessicated state in salt deposits after 250 million years, it's not an unreasonable assumption. Further assume that a serendipitous series of celestial mechanical jugglery speeds up our spore enough to break free of our solar system. That's 26 mi/sec, or 93,600 mph. And now, we wait. Alpha Centauri, the nearest candidate star, is 4.3 light years away, or 25.8 trillion miles. Dividing our distance by speed gives us a travel time of ~275,600,000 hours, or 31,461 years. That's not that bad.Figure on a latency of a few hundred thousand to million years between chances for further \"voyages\", and the majority of the galaxy could be colonized by bacterial life in as little as 3 to 4 billion years. Given that the life on Earth has been around some 3.9 billion years, there's a slim chance Earth life has colonized the galaxy and we will never know."},
{"title": "Amundsen at the South Pole", "date": "Wednesday, December 14, 2011", "text": "It's the centennial today, Dec. 14, 1911. And, aside from a kerosene heater or two, Amundsen did it all with Upper Paleolithic technology - with the help of a lot of prior preparation and an indispensable co-evolved species known as the dog.Scott, perhaps better known through his tragedy, was beaten to the pole by a good five weeks. It's hard to understand how Scott considered the use of sled dogs bad sportsmanship. Somehow, the use of gasoline powered tractors and ponies was not. I suppose incompetence and poor planning made up for any unacknowledged \"cheating\", especially once the tractors broke down and the ponies died of exposure, and Scott was forced to use Lower Paleolithic technology, pulling the sledges by hand.It's kind of weird to think of how things have changed and not changed over the course of one hundred years. If I look around my place and subtract all the things that were not around one hundred years ago, the place would be quite threadbare. Lamps, I guess, would be there. A telephone, seeing as I am quite possibly the last man on earth with a landline. But the TV, the VCR/DVD player, the computer, the clock radio, the electric stove, the refrigerator, not only all in the future, but many of the components still in the future. (If you wonder about the appalling sparseness of current shit, well no, I am not a Luddite. I'm a late adopter. I prefer you get the metaphorical cell-phone shaped tumor on the side of your head, and then when that kink is gotten out of that piece of technology, I'll get it).Then again, would someone from 1911 feel at his ease in my home. Of course. Most of the stuff unfamiliar to him would still be conceptually familiar. Why, even the computer, would be understandable and predictable.  True, something of a marvel, but still something understandable.What wouldn't be? Oh, well, I'd be a lot stinkier back then, with bad skin, bad breath and missing teeth, and probably smallpox scars. Probably a tapeworm, or if I lived south of the Mason-Dixon line, \"seasoned\" by malaria. I'd be threatened with diphtheria, scarlet fever, tetanus, tuberculosis, just to name a short few of the many diseases. 1911 is just at the end of the completion of many US sanitary projects, so I would just now be able to drink water that did not have someone else's shit in it.Oh, and, I'd be ten years past the average life span and probably dying of stomach cancer (now practically non-existent).So, that's all working out pretty well."},
{"title": "\"People of Earth! Attention! People of Earth! Attention!\"", "date": "Tuesday, December 13, 2011", "text": "\"What? WHAT?\"\"Oh..., nothing\". When I was in, oh, I don't know, I guess 4th grade, I saw a movie called \"Earth vs. The Flying Saucers\". In retrospect, it's embarrassing to watch, much like admitting to watching the Space Hippie Episode on Star Trek. And the screenwriters for the movie must have been the same Aspergian group that went on to write movies like \"Kronos\" or  \"20 Million Miles to Earth\". Which is to say a collection of writers in possession of an affable and earnest super-dorkiness which guarantees reception of an Atomic Wedgie, or at least a Purple Herbie.The Future.. drawn...today!Regardless, for several months afterwards, I would draw pictures of tanks vs. flying saucers. And they pretty much looked like this over on the right. It's not a very good picture, but I chalk that up to drawing with computer mouse, which is rather like drawing with a pencil up your butt. Now, you will notice I have only the one tank against the one flying saucer, but in the original series, there was a whole Shakespearian cosmology of dramatic encounters, with both tanks and flying saucers exploding in jagged edged fulminations, and both aliens and men set aflame! And further note that the flying saucers require radar dish emitters to broadcast their lightning beams. Not being an expert on high energy collimating weapons, I had to rely on Hollywood's expertise. Interestingly, had this picture been done by a Name Artist, like Warhol, or Picasso, it would easily be worth a cool million at Sotheby's.How fucked up is that?Flash forward to the year 1976, and I am asked to join in a project to help produce a text-based adventure game played on a computer. The first I know of was called Colossal Cave, and it kind of went like: \"You are standing in the middle of a forest path. To your left is a small grass hut with an elf standing in the doorway.Club Elf. The elf had a small key which you now possess.Club Elf. The elf is dead. You have a small key.\" You get the idea. No, I didn't play the game.Okay, I played it. But I gave up pretty quickly as it was fucking boring. But here was the deal, and it was kind of interesting. Attending an Intro to Astronomy class and one of the students wanted to develop a text-based adventure game that was also science educational. The professor was enthusiastically on board, and was willing to accept the student's proposal as a grade-worthy project - should he develop it. The idea was it would present game puzzles that would also be lessons in physics and astronomy. After hashing various scenarios out in class, it was decided the game would be called Moon Base, and it would be a narrative on lunar colonization. I received the assignment of justification for the moon base from the professor, after I objected to the whole plausibility of a lunar colony being established the far-off future date of 1999. So, here's what I come up with. (And, although this justification ended my participation in the game development, I still ended up with an 'A' for the assignment. Hurray for me!). In the year 1983, astronomers discover that a two mile wide asteroid is going to impact the earth sometime in 1995. It is a carbonaceous chondrite asteroid, which is seredipitous. Carbonaceous chondrite meteorites have been found to contain both water and carbon. In fact, the average one contains up to 10% water, and unusual contain organic compounds. These are substances which are common on Earth, but rare in space, just the kind valuable materials you would like to mine up in space.Well, also, it turns out these types of asteroids are usually loose collections of boulders, never having become hot enough to melt together to form a solid object. So, the usual dipshit military procedure of zapping one of these guys with an H-bomb is out of the question. What to do with this sucker?...a little bit to the left... no, my left... that's it!But hey, when life hands you lemons, make lemonade. Since the space jockeys have a whole decade to plan something before Death From Above, they come up with idea of diverting the asteroid and \"soft\" landing it on the Moon. The deal is, they build a series of nuclear powered space tugs, go up and intercept the asteroid, use the mass of the tugs to gravitationally change its trajectory so that it impacts the Moon at a \"relatively\" slow speed, and you end up with a hundred mile long oval footprint of carbonaceous goodness on the surface of the Moon.Not only does the scenario provide a good reason for a massive space effort, but it also provides a bonanza on the Moon, providing just the right materials for a successful Moon Base.I thought it was pretty clever.I am such a dork."},
{"title": "Libertopia For Dummies", "date": "Monday, December 12, 2011", "text": "First off, I have to warn you. There will be disturbing images in this essay. You were warned.2001: A Space OdysseyA phone conversation with eldest bro always puts me in hypercynical mode for a few days. That, coupled with the fact that I do tend to rail against the incessant and ongoing stupidity of humanity, suggests the following is going to be a misanthropic complaint. But hopefully not so. Hopefully there will be some constructive criticism in there.Eldest brother, talking with his son's friends, opined as how at this time, the year 2011 the hope was, when he was their age, that humanity would at least have a moon base. Granted, the movie \"2001\" set the bar pretty freaking high. Not only bases on the moon, but space hotels in Earth orbit, regular flights to and from Earth's surface to orbit, and,  if that weren't enough, throw in an intelligent computer to boot.With that kind of expectation, practically anything less is a disappointment. And so, what was the big deal of the 21st century? What was the major technological accomplishment for 2001, or 2011? Google? Facebook?Pathetic. A glorified advertising and marketing industry set up to extract personal information and sell it off to the highest bidder. There's your glorious vision. Alright, let's be fair. There was no way we were ever going to get to where 2001 wanted to take us. Not without a few nuclear rockets blowing up in the atmosphere. Not without a sustained grand vision, something bordering on religious fervor. Not without a major kick in the ass to get us going.Can we blame the Baby Boomers for this? Granted, they we are quite the most useless, selfish, self-absorbed, risk-averse, pampered, privileged generation EVER produced. But, you know, there is that thing mathematicians call the Principle of Least Action. All things being equal, all complex systems would rather coast along than expend effort and energy. With no gun to our heads, like the (*cough*bullshit*cough*) Greatest Generation before us, we coasted along.  And what would it have taken to get us into space? Some kind of existential threat that's for sure. Or some enormous enticement, some glittering cosmic treasure. But it didn't happen.Fat-ass Captain from Wall-EI tell you what did happen. We pursued happiness as far as we could, with the last 40-or-so years in overdrive. And as a result, we've been living in Libertopia for the past 400-some years.The real deal, soon to be the 85% of America You want the real movie about the future? Try Wall-E. Except we never go into space. Don't think so? Really now, think about it. If you are a certain demographic, you've pretty much gotten to do whatever the hell you wanted to do. You've enjoyed the maximum freedom as is possible without seriously wrecking society at large. And now, the party is over. And you have people like Ron Paul who, rather than trying to make Libertopia manifest and real, are actually trying to keep the party going just a little bit longer.The Paragon of AnimalsThe Very Flower of American MasculinityWho is this demographic? Why it's obvious, isn't it? Rednecks. Stupid white people. Dumbass, country-fuck, dipshit, cocksucking, fat, toothless, ignorantly proud, proudly ignorant asshole white guys. Do whatever they want. Get as fat and stupid as they want. Pretty much enjoy any intoxicant they want. Treat everyone else like shit, and it's been a blast. But it's over now. And probably as just as well.Hey Ron Paul?

{"title": "Demarchy, revisited", "date": "Friday, December 9, 2011", "text": "Steven Pinker claims that, historically, humanity is getting less and less violent.I don't think I buy into that. I have to at least question both his data collection and his metrics. He weighs total casualties during periods of violence divided by total population at that time. There may be other parameters involved, I would at least hope, like making sure the casualty rate excluded death by disease, famine, and other privations. How would this metric work on historical natural disasters? Would the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo and Yokohama and claimed around 105,000 lives, be considered more violent than the 2010 Haiti earthquake, with 300,000 lives lost only because more people were around in 2010? That's silly.But using this metric, Pinker classifies China's An Lushan revolt and civil war with a higher violence coefficient that WWII. Is that really kosher? Well, this commenter's bullshit detector went off.Regardless, I would have had Pinker set his group of little grad students collecting and collating data on a much more important assertion, one that I hopefully am cherry-picking by counting the obvious affirmatives and ignoring the negatives, which is that, as the Russians say: \"Whether salt water or fresh, shit floats to the top\". Or, more succinctly, in order to succeed, you need to be an asshole.Is human society that fucked up? Or the laws of natural selection? That you need to be an asshole to get ahead? Well, I think Pinker and his staff need to work on this.If true, I think I have an empirical test for a systemic utopian fix. And it goes back to the idea of demarchy. I wrote an essay on this about a year ago. And a quick re-read of this suggests, wow, I've really got to brush up on my profane deprecative skills.Now, I am not quite ready to say the democracy doesn't work. I am willing to say that the quick fixes, the bandaids, the simplistic solutions proposed will not work.Term limits, for example, are completely fucking stupid. What term limits will do is to select for the most virulent, vile, corrupted asshole cocksuckers for office. Easily. Since money and politics are intimately connected, inextricable, always and forever entwined and entangled, whether it is election funds or taxpayer revenues, you will always, always have people who wish to feed at the public trough at the public expense. Term limits merely sets up an environment which further encourages public servants to get theirs while they can. So, these fixes are just fucking juvenile, and should be ignored.But! But, I think I have a systemic solution and it amounts to this observation from nature: natural selection. When you select in nature, the filter is death and the filter is permanent, but the filter is done after the facts, or rather, the performance. And that filter, at the societal level, should be voting.Problem is, we do it all wrong. We do it ass-backwards. What we should do, under the Kurman Variation of Demarchy is to vote people OUT of office, not into it.So, quick review, demarchy is government by lottery, just like jury duty. It's not election time, it's selection time, and you, my dear, have been chosen by lot to serve. But, the main complaint about demarchy is, what if you get some idiot chosen by lot to serve in office? No problem. That's where elections come in.You can still have recall elections, but you also have delections. And a delection is this:\"So we got Governor Titlapper in office and he wasn't recalled for being an insufferable cabbagehead, but he still sucks in some ways. Does he suck enough for removal? Yes or no?\"If he is not delected from office, he continues to serve. Otherwise, vote the bum out, his (or her) number is tossed aside, and we re-draw from the pool.You got to admit, government by lottery is a heck of a lot more democratic than the current system we have. And who is to say you can't find wise, competent, and qualified people who are currently collecting food stamps. Because all you have to is look at the idiot millionaires currently fucking the country up, and say, Jesus, there's got to be better people out there than these asshole cocksuckers."},
{"title": "The Era of Peak Art", "date": "Thursday, December 8, 2011", "text": "Art Basel is in the news. They've had their big show in Miami Beach, and word on the street is the art market is hot, hot, hot - as in big ol' zit of an asset bubble ready to pop hot. Of course, I'm talking high-end art, which, honestly, you can't really consider art.It's more commodity than art. One person who has currently helped the centuries-old long-term commoditization of the whole high end art market is Charles Saatchi. He who has done for the art market what complex derivatives did for the financial world. Saatchi, no small irony here, bemoans the current crop of collectors as \"... Eurotrashy, Hedge-fundy, Hamptonites; ... trendy oligarchs and oiligarchs\".And so what? What's wrong with the idea of art as commodity? Why is it so bad that a Warhol, or a   Twombly, or a Hopper, or even a Rembrandt or a daVinci, be thrown into the same category as barrels of oil, ingots of copper, wheat, soybeans, coffee, and hog bellies? These are all things that are available to the human animal to enjoy and consume. To say that art is somehow not to be included in this cycle of acquistion, that it is to be held in higher regard is in some sense quite delusional.And, just as, say, oil is a limited commodity, as in they ain't (yet) making any more of it, so it we should view art. There should be quotes on the proven and unproven reserves of art in this country and in the world.Because eventually, all rank speculation aside, if you aren't producing quality artists, you'll be running out of quality art, and sooner rather than later. In fact, I suspect we will be facing, at some ppoint in the near future, the Era of Peak Art, and a consequent Art Crisis.Now, I know for you and me, since we are just Regular Folks, that the coming shooting war pf the oligarchs might make for a small of amusement, but what of the artists? I can tell you, if history is any guide, that rather than being valued and protected, will instead be abused and appropriated, just like little baby girls in China. You'd think all that female infanticide would make potential female mates for all those mateless boys an extremely valued commodity, but no, instead it's the opposite. the illicit trade in girls is thriving. They are being abducted, enslaved, and mistreated at unprecedented rates.And so it will be with future artists. Perhaps there will be protected reserves for them. They will tagged, radio-collared, and guarded. But they will also be poached. And, given the insanity of our species, like bush meat, futures artists will probably be hunted to near extinction just to increase the value of their art.Interesting times ahead, for sure."},
{"title": "1960s TV Really Fucked Me Up", "date": "Wednesday, December 7, 2011", "text": "Word on the street is the US Air Force Space Command is throwing SETI a bone - supplying monies so they can check out Kepler-22b. You know, Kepler-22b? The superearth orbiting in a G type star's \"Goldilocks zone\" some 600 light years from here? Uh? Superearth? A radius 2.4 times that of the Earth's? Goldilocks Zone? Orbiting the star where liquid water is possible on the surface of the planet? You are keeping up on the science news, right?So, the idea is suddenly this is Earth's twin and there could be life there. Provided, of course, this planet has the right mass, which we can't tell.  I mean, it's fucking amazing that they can tell how big it is, from three thousand five hundred twenty-six trillion miles away. (No, really, don't let the budget \"crisis\" fool you, that's a big fucking number). But what they don't know is the planet's mass, because it could be, like some health-conscious German stool inspection category: watery, gassy, or solid, which is to say, rocky.Now, if it is watery, it can't have too much water, otherwise it will undoubtedly have an ocean several hundred miles deep, and at the bottom of that ocean will be a peculiar form of pressurized ice. And that's not a good place for terrestrial life to form. Then again, if it is rocky, then with the radius being what it is, it is more likely a big super Venus, and that's no place to hang out. And if it is gassy, then it is a mini-Neptune, and again, no place you'd want to spend time at.But, what the hell, SETI needs a new pair of shoes, and if they get to use their radio telescopes to check it out for Space Command for \"space situational awareness\", then why not? I can tell them right now, save them some time, that nope, nobody home. No life. Just like Mars. But hey, whatever, better to spend the money on that than tax breaks for job creators, which has done us Earthlings so much good.And, you know, Space Command kind of reminds of Alpha Control from the old \"Lost in Space\" TV series. The series was just so hokey, not serious the way Star Trek was, but looking back, I suspect they had a better take on all things alien out there. Which is, if they are out there (and Where Are They?), they really don't give a shit about us. I mean, every time the Robinson's ran into a technologically superior alien race, which was always, the aliens were about as happy to see them as you are a homeless person wanting to wash your car windshield.\"No. No. No. No. Thank you. NO! Oh. Shit. Fine. Here. Here is some neutronium. Yes. You're welcome\".But honestly, that's the way it was, well, that and fuses had been invented so you didn't have sparks flying over the place whenever the power was turned on. But, hey, cut Irwin Allen some slack. I hear he was as bugfuck crazy as Mickey Rooney). And all the space alien babes have super powers and wear capes.Anyway, Kepler-22b. Nothing there. Okay. Nothing. Except, oh, maybe the Bugs."},
{"title": "\"Thinking Fast and Slow\" by Daniel Kahneman", "date": "Tuesday, December 6, 2011", "text": "I've just watched the mutual dick sucking festival between Newt Gingrich and Donald Trump and tried to keep from retching.Newt Gingrich: nothing a little spontaneous human combustion wouldn't cure.Although, not really wishing much harm on my fellow humans, I'd just as soon put the entire Republican clown car - including the sticky wet turd Donald Trump - onto a ice flow and shove them off into the Bering Sea. You know, an experiment,  just to see who gets eaten last, or which orca finally gets tired of playing with which bloated corpse. Nothing bizarre. Nothing grotesque. Just some good old-fashioned natural justice.Speaking of Newt, I suspect he wouldn't get the fast-or-slow solution to the following problem, and it is mainly because Mr. Six Sigma is, despite conservative misconceptions, intellectually a fucking retard, and ethically an empty shit bag.Ready? Think Fast! Think Slow! Problem: A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat is $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? Answer at the end.This is one many examples of figuring out how people think, and that's the cool thing about, not just Daniel Kahneman's papers, but Kahneman and Amos Tversky's papers. They have fun puzzles in them. In case you haven't figured it out, this is a mini-review of Kahneman's book \"Thinking Fast and Slow\". I call this a mini-review because I obtained the book through the public library's new purchases reservation system, and so have had only two weeks to read it. So, I skimmed. Just as well, as probably 80% of the material I was already familiar with. As is Kahneman, for this book is primarily, a summary of not only his lifelong research, but other psychologists findings as well. As such, I would classify this book as a worthwhile introductory textbook, and leave it at that. If you are unfamiliar with this area, then I recommend reading it. If, like me, you have some familiarity with the materials, then I suggest you skim and not worry overmuch on missing the juicy stuff. The salient points will catch your eye, and you will be rewarded.  I first came across Kahneman in an article in \"The Economist\" magazine, which was devoted to demolishing the Chicago School's neo-classical version of economic models. I'm also ashamed to say that I also came Kahneman and Tversky through Malcolm Gladwell's book \"Blink\". (The nicest thing I can say about that book is that it provided a fun bibliography to work through). Back to the Chicago School, not being an economist or a psychologist, I still, through casual observation of human beings and occasional chance readings, came to the conclusion long ago that human beings are not rationally self-interested agents. Or rather, that a rational description served poorly to describe the human animal. In a more succinct manner, identical to my critique of the works of Ayn Rand, would be put thus: \"What kind of a fucking retard would buy into this bullshit?\"Kahneman devotes a large amount of the book to developing two fictional characters, the two functional personae that make up your mind: System 1 and System 2.System 1 is, for lack of a better term, your intuitive self, your associational engine. System 2, again for lack of a better term, is your rational self, your logical computer. System 1 has been honed by millions of years of evolution to be the very clever, very spontaneous, animal mind that each and every one of us relies upon to make it through the day. System 1 is the fast thinker.  System 2 is the slow thinker. System 2 allocates attention to effortful activities such as complex computations, problems of agency, choice, judgement, and concentration. It is also extremely lazy. If System 2 can get away with not having to do work, and rely upon the mental activities of System 1, it will. This lies at the heart of practically every cognitive illusion and fallacy we operate under. Not all. We have to keep in mind that logic is stupid. That rationality is NOT the same as intelligence. But still, it requires work to be logical, and if we can get away with the minimum amount of effort, we will. From my own personal introspections, I offer an indefensible allegory. We've all heard of the false myth that we use only ten percent of our brains. I submit that only ten percent of my brain is used to produce the conscious me, the \"ego\". The other ninety percent is used to produce the subconscious me, the myriad associational, emotional, instinctive, embodied processes that make up the majority of me. (In some sense, this part is an alien other, a portion that, failing to be replicated in an artificial intelligence, pretty dooms the whole project from the get-go. Then again, a realistic replication of this alien other, in an attempt to simulate human intelligence, may also doom an AI to automatic insanity). So, in summary, I recommend the book to any reader. There's both insight for the beginner, and clarified summaries for the old hand.Answer: Fast think: the ball costs ten cents. Slow think: if x is the amount of the ball, then x + (x + $1.00) = $1.10, then 2x = $1.10 - $1.00, then x =  five cents.Don't feel bad if you quickly said ten cents. Even Nobel Prize winning economists and people from Harvard business school and MIT get this one wrong. That's fast thinking for you.Better to be quick and wrong than right and dead."},

You're an Idiot!\" Luntz. The list is by someone named Walter, but it sounds suspiciously like something I recall being put out by the Green Party of America. I tried to do some research, which, of course, consisted of perhaps a 30 second google search. In other words, I put in zero effort to trace the source. Regardless, there are some sound ideas in here. Others sounds like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. My occasional thoughts below in italics. After reading through and commenting, I'm seeing that most of these items are actually kind of limited horizon short-term small visions fixes. Like most legislation, so what the fuck, try 'em anyway.1) End Corporate Personhood  (Keep Human Rights OUR Rights)2) Reverse Citizens United (Corporate Money is Not Free Speech)1) & 2) pretty much the same goal, no? How to do this? One suggestion is a constitutional amendment to limit corporate and special interest monies in politics. I don't see this happening for a number of legal and real world reasons. Rather than restricting corporate funding, how about making it completely transparent? That seems a lot easier to do, and it's probably constitutional.   3) Prohibit All Former and Future Congressmen or Staff from being a Paid Lobbyist.(Get Out of Washington) 4) Prohibit Any Lobbyist from offering ANY Monetary Compensation, Gift or Job or any future promise of the same to Any Congressman, or Congressmen’s Family, Staff  or Federal Employee Directly involved with congress. (Congress Not For Sale)End the revolving door between the Capitol and K Street? Ain't gonna happen.  No more than prohibiting the selection of candidates for memberships on corporate board of directors. However, the selection field, like for those of the CEO field, could be broadened beyond the usual short list of asshole cocksuckers.5) Apply All Conflict of Interest and Insider Trading Laws to Congress. (End Market Manipulation)I believe I've read OWS objections along this line. This is completely doable and should be done right now. 6) Hold all Business Interests, Stock Bonds, and Assets in a Blind Trust During the Term of Office or at the very least, 2 Weeks Before Congress is in Session and end 30 Days After the Session. (Keep Congress Honest, Remove Temptation)This is completely doable. Not sure what impact it would have, as a congress person could always have an \"informed\"  third party handle their finances to get around this.7) Prohibited Tax Breaks for Any Companies SENDING Jobs Overseas!

{"title": "Is Bret Stephens Stupid?", "date": "Wednesday, November 30, 2011", "text": "Or does he assume everyone else is as stupid? That's one of the hallmarks of a stupid person, you know. Whenever I need to know what stupid people are supposed to be thinking, I read the editorials at the Wall Street Journal. And then, if I want to know what incredibly stupid people are thinking, I'll read the comments from the readers of the WSJ. If these people are a representative cross-section of the business executive population, it's a wonder we don't have a stock crash every other day.It's really quite sad how, with Murdoch buying that paper, it has just turned into the worst shitrag on the market. Take the following opinion from Bret Stephens on the Great Global Warming Fizzle. According to the WSJ, Bret Stephens received his education at the University of Chicago and the London School of Economics. Really, I didn't know they offered a degree in fluffing. And the op/ed piece Stephens wrote is unquestionably a professional level fluff job. The question is who is he fluffing? Is this just a feel good piece for the readers? Something to take their minds off how much they suck, compared to the general population? I don't know. It sure as hell isn't supposed to be factual or persuasive or of any useful purpose in terms of a worthwhile dialog.So I have to assume this is just Bret Stephens' print version of a holiday blowjob to his readers.Slurp. Slurp. Says Stephens:\"Consider the case of global warming, another system of doomsaying prophecy and faith in things unseen. As with religion, it is presided over by a caste of spectacularly unattractive people pretending to an obscure form of knowledge that promises to make the seas retreat and the winds abate. As with religion, it comes with an elaborate list of virtues, vices and indulgences. As with religion, its claims are often non-falsifiable, hence the convenience of the term \"climate change\" when thermometers don't oblige the expected trend lines. As with religion, it is harsh toward skeptics, heretics and other \"deniers.\" And as with religion, it is susceptible to the earthly temptations of money, power, politics, arrogance and deceit\".So, what I'm guessing is he is none too popular with the evangelical portion of the conservative tribe. You know, the Tea Party types who want us all to buy into the notion that America is a Christian nation first and foremost? To call these people \"spectacularly unattractive\", for starters, is an interesting form of fellatio. But is that it? Is that his only descriptive for climatologists  and those who heed their data? That's hardly a convincing argument. Not to mention that listed among those poor deluded religious types are hard-nosed realists like the US Armed Forces and insurance companies. But their opinion doesn't matter to Stephens. He keeps blathering away like the oily little shill he is:\"Yet a funny thing happened on the way to the climate apocalypse. Namely, the financial apocalypse. The U.S., Russia, Japan, Canada and the EU have all but confirmed they won't be signing on to a new Kyoto. The Chinese and Indians won't make a move unless the West does. The notion that rich (or formerly rich) countries are going to ship $100 billion every year to the Micronesias of the world is risible, especially after they've spent it all on Greece\".So, I guess because the tycoons to whom Stephens services have taken a big old shit and fallen over, and have wasted all of the working people's hard-earned monies on a scam, climate change is now no longer a problem. Exemplary reasoning there Slurpy! Smarmy Fuckface continues: \"Cap and trade is a dead letter in the U.S. Even Europe is having second thoughts about carbon-reduction targets that are decimating the continent's heavy industries and cost an estimated $67 billion a year. \"Green\" technologies have all proved expensive, environmentally hazardous and wildly unpopular duds.\"  Cap and trade is dead. Who killed that again? Who was not going to make a money on that? And, uh, why is Europe accelerating the second phase of their carbon trade system, if it is wrecking their economy? And why is it that the world economies are now putting more monies into renewable energy than fossil fuel in new power generation? Could it be that Stephens is ignoring facts, pretending to an obscure form of knowledge that promises to make the seas retreat and the winds abate? Or is he just yawning that jaw bone as far open as he can to accept cock? Well, he's paid, well for his services, so...Wait a minute, now, what about all those hacked climategate emails? What's the word on their impact. Oh, right, still doesn''t change the fundamental science. Still doesn't change the consensus.And who hacked them anyway? Who's in trouble for hacking into lately? Hmm?And despite the climate \"skeptics\" shrill denouncements, the evidence against them keeps piling up. Why, even a Koch-funded scientist who was supposed to debunk global wamring says it's all real.Oops. Sorry, Stephens. Maybe you should just stick to opining about bombing Iran.Addition: Latest NOAA report suggests we lost the battle of Arctic recovery back in 2006.Sorry, Bret, you silly little cocksucker, but Greenland is getting green - or will be in your pampered little lifetime:  http://motherjones.com/blue-marble/2011/12/noaa-arctic-report-card-3-fs-2-csYesterdayTodayLast time it happened, back in April 2010, I chalked it up to abrasive grit in the eye.

Which means I'm 450 million light years from Earth, seated in an incredibly ergonomic buttock-caressing barstool at the bar in Sam's Pub. I'm drinking a spectacular super lager with just the right amount of hops. Not enough to be overpowering, but enough to give the beer a bite.It's a beautiful day here in Spiral City. I know this because all the bars here are not darkened caves but open to the sky, with windows and skylights everywhere. I can see just the most achingly beautiful set of puffy clouds right above me, and the horizon holds a darkness of promise - a warm, gentle, delightful rain later this afternoon.A quick check of the Mr. Mark's Melodies app via my nonlocally connected aqueous assistant assures me that (per the musical incantations Mark derived from his father Hugh Everett III's nearly-lost Basement Equations*), there is not a Divergence in sight for the next week. I'm worry free through next Monday. What could be better? In the BOAPW? Um, nothing.I often am amazed at how we pulled it off. Humanity, that is. How we not only managed to survive, but became worthy of survival. How a Hobbsian race - feral, brutish, and nasty - through a miraculous serendipity, became a fairly decent and respectable species - gentle, wise, tolerant, generous, and most importantly to sparse and fragile alien life, neighborly. Still more amazing is how we spread throughout the cosmos in a mere twenty years to occupy a cubic hundred thousand billion light year volume of spacetime. A volume which, despite our teeming trillions, is still imbued with a population density barely that of a wisp of smoke. Even more amazing is how the Older Races (vast forces eons older than us) tolerate our existence, and well, honestly, even when we reach their plateau, do not view us as a threat.Could things get any better? Again, in the BOAPW? Quite simply, no.This past week, being the universally recognized period of thanksgiving, is just a touch ironic given the anniversaries of a huge horde of Divergences that occur.  And a disturbing majority of them are Reagan Divergences.True, the nuclear arms race peaked in 1986, but its the years 1981 through 1985 that have more nuclear wars than the rest of the 20th century put together. Amazing. The peak of these Divergences is, not surprisingly, November 24th, 1985. You'd think it might be March 24th, 1983, the day after Reagan made his \"Star Wars\" speech. But no, with the Reagan administration's dismissal reinterpretation of the ABM Treaty in late October 1985, the Soviets conclude that the US is gearing up to start a nuclear war. The expected value of the contingent shit hitting the counterfactual fan jumps alarmingly several dozen times on November 24th.  Reagan with Dr. MerkwürdigliebeThe whole harrowing slew of disasters finally tapered off soon after, when Foreign Minister Anatoly Dobrynin informed President Reagan of the Soviet Doomsday Machine (officially known as System Perimeter, and unofficially as Dead Hand). The formerly belligerent Reagan, after realizing that all of his rhetoric and actions had been interpreted as an intention on the part of the United States to start a nuclear war, settled the fuck down.Fortunately for all of us, the old asshole did settle the fuck down, and it also helped that Gorbachev stepped onto the stage. Few recognize the value of this man, but that's the reason there's a statue to him down in the central park of Spiral City. The Good Earth, courtesy http://solarsystem.nasa.govAnd in 2050CE, I don't think you can find much that is named after Reagan anymore. Not even the National Airport in Washington DC, back on good old Earth.* Did I not explain all this? Mark Everett, son of Hugh Everett III, found a pile of papers crammed with mathematical formulae in the basement of the family home. Mark, like most of humanity, not being instinctively statistically inclined, called three of his father's friends to see if they wanted the stuff. Fortunately for all us, the four of them were able, through an interpretation of tones and rhythms, to convert Hugh's maths into musical incantations. Those incantations opened up time, space, the forces of nature, and the universe to humanity. Proper applications of such showed us all possible contingencies to every possible situation. This allowed us to avoid the majority of catastrophes which would befall humanity for a million years up and down the arrow of Time. Catastrophes which, through avoidance, become unfortunate alternate timelines now known as Divergences. They also pointed us toward the associational coherence which, now called the Convergence, possessed us all into a one-and-only-one wonderful Now known as BOAPW."},

Back home in Indiana last weekend, a friend of mine had some dead wood littering his yard. We cut it up to burn it in his chimnea (which, because of the way it looks, like a steam powered diving helmet, I call it Captain Nemo).After about fifteen seconds into the process of cutting and chopping up these small limbs of pretty much rotted wood, I was completely exhausted. I reminded myself of someone I knew in my youth, who was (possibly still is) the second most laziest person on the planet. This person's classic line, when we went for a hike in Turkey Run State Park, was: \"Let's not going anywhere uphill.\"I am told by eldest brother that I should not feel so badly about being feeble, and that, being in our mid-50s, by frontiersman's standards of life expectancy, we would be under the ground for some time now. Still, these past 10,000 years have made wusses of us all, have they not? In more robust times, I'd have just snapped all those limbs by hand, without the use of tools.(Also, isn't it funny how there are places like Titan and Neptune with literally trillions of years worth of natural gas to burn through, but it would take the next technological energy source to get to them? Ironic.)The other irony I would note is that, we worry so much about fossil carbon resources, and yet, as this video shows, we care very little for our fossil oxygen resource. The only time one cares about breathing, is when he cannot draw breath.Enough talk, on with the show. Next week, firecrackers and liquid nitrogen!"},
{"title": "Pseudorapidity", "date": "Tuesday, November 22, 2011", "text": "When I was about twelve or thirteen years of age, I found a book at the public library titled \"Spacetime Physics\", by Edwin F. Taylor, and John Wheeler. Despite having only just mastered decimals, fractions, and ratios, I was able to follow this book on Einstein's Special Relativity. It wasn't that I was a precocious young sprout. Rather that the text of this book was just so damn clear and accessible that even a 6th grader could follow it.Well, after reading through the book a few times,  I realized I could compute just how much fuel the starship Enterprise needed to zoom around in space.Well, actually, no. I didn't know about the square root of minus one yet. I also had no solid figures on what the equivalent to specific impulse a warp plasma  using a dilithium conversion of matter/antimatter explosion was.Relativistic Kinetic EnergySo, instead, I decided, since I knew what specific impulse was from my geek eldest brother, I decided to find out just how much fuel it would take for 190,000 tons of the Enterprise to go from zero to almost the speed of light (.99c) using its impulse drive. I just found the (theoretical) numbers in other books at the library, applied No. 2 pencil to yellow tab paper, plugged in the numbers into the equation for relativistic momentum, and voila!Imagine my disappointment, when my figures indicated a fuel tank full of liquid hydrogen approximately ten times the volume of the USS Enterprise.Well, my sixth grade calculations were off just a bit. Really more like a fuel tank a thousand times the volume of the Enterprise. Nevertheless, I was quite disillusioned with the show.(I think that was also the year I figured a loving personal God was also probably not in the offings as well. At least, no God worth worshiping. But that was done strictly via good old fashioned logic and scholasticism. So, two birds with one stone, basically).But the graph for relativistic momentum provided me with a new epistemological metaphor for science and technology and truth. See? The closer you get to absolute truth, the harder it gets to get there. That particular mental model stuck with me well through high school, until I got to college.No, I did not become a postmodern relativist butthead, thank you. I just realized that:1) There may be no such thing as absolute truth2) If such a thing exists, the path to it may be not so straightforward and direct3) There's always going backwards, backtracking, dead ends, blind alleys, and wild goose chases4) Even if you manage to struggle to the top of one mountain, there's a whole new, much bigger range on the horizon. Now what do I think about stuff like this?I think... I think I need a nap."},
{"title": "The Worm and the Thing", "date": "Monday, November 21, 2011", "text": "- or - Why Buy the Cow When You Can Get the Milk For Free?I'll just call them Victor (as in Frankenstein). Pardon the nationality mashup, since we don't know who they are, but have a pretty good idea that they are a they and that they are either Russian or Ukrainian (I'm betting Russian).I call them Victor because they created a monster. It's theirs and they pwn it. They created more than just a monster, though. They created a whole new business model, and it is the wave of the future. And it is brilliant, because they borrowed from the best, the strategy of evolution itself.In 1938 John Campbell wrote a science fiction novella called \"Who Goes There?\" Later it was adapted into two movies. The first movie by Howard Hawks, \"The Thing From Another World\", was considered a science fiction horror movie classic. The second movie, John Carpenter's \"The Thing\", conforms more to the original story. In Hawks' version, the monster is your standard humanoid monster, ala Frankenstein's monster. In Carpenter's version, it is much more alien, more like the Blob - all consuming, but with that imposter twist - and the accompanying paranoia as to whom to trust.I've read Campbell's novella, and it scared the hell out me. I'll tell you why. One of the more delicious fears one can have is not fear of death, but fear of lack of control. The alien creature doesn't just consume you. It imitates you. It enslaves you. It mutilates your mind and will, and binds you to service it. The other factor is just the right amount of information. In a horror flick, or in a story, you need just enough information to know that something is a threat, perhaps even an existential threat, but not so much information that you are familiar with the threat. This has always been a problem in movies. How much of the monster do you show? Not enough, and it is all just boring. Too much, and the monster is just another character. There is a defining scene in Campbell's story when the humans realize that even the tiniest piece of monster can take over an organism. And when one character realizes that their cows have not been monitored against \"infection\", and that they have all been drinking the milk.\"Mac, how long have the... cows been... not cows?\"  It's a great creepy moment, when he realizes, in a fit of revulsion, hysteria, and self-loathing, that he may be a Thing and not even know it.So it is with Victor's monster. What is Victor's monster? Well, you may have heard of it. It's called the Conficker Worm. It's a computer worm that was unleashed (as far as we know) back in 2008 or so.Well, hold on. What's a worm? The term can be traced back to John Brunner's amazingly prescient 1975 science fiction novel \"The Shockwave Rider\". Brunner envisioned a future world connected by a global \"data-net\". The data-net, in turn, is controlled by a malevolent corporate-state entity. The protagonist of the story, a hacker named Nick Haflinger, creates a computer program he calls a \"tapeworm\", which infiltrates the net, takes control over computers, issues orders to replicate itself in still more computers, and, ultimately subverts the data-net, and releases all the nasty crony-capitalist secret files to the public.Brunner chose to call the program a tapeworm because the viral code consisted of a string of segments that could each reproduce itself onto another computer - another \"node\" in the net.The Conficker worm does pretty much that, but without the good intentions. Once this worm infiltrated a computer (yours, perhaps) it would look for others, and continue replicating as far as it could. All of these computers would then link themselves into a \"botnet\". A botnet is capable of good and bad things. The good witch versions of botnets could also be called \"clouds\", and they are capable of tremendous data-processing feats that allow complex problems to be solved, or vast amounts of data to be shared and stored. The bad witch version of botnets can be used to launch Denial of Service attacks against websites, or unleash a storm of spam, phish for identity theft, rattle cyberlocks for open doors to steal funds, or flood networks with all sorts of scareware and fraudulent bullshit. If you have enough computers and infiltrated the right systems, you could even, conceivably, disrupt a nation's electronic grid, or banks, or telephones, air traffic, financial markets, health-care systems, or even take down the entire Internet itself.You could do all those awful things, that is, if you are thinking like a small-time hoodlum, a small-minded one-time blackmailer, a hooligan, a vandal, a stupid barbarian. But then again, for someone smart enough to code something that stymies even the hackers that created the Internet, why would you do that? There is so much more money to be had, power to be accrued, if your botnet is big and stable and lasts for a long, long time.And there's the brilliant business model. Rather than raise havoc, or rent out access to the botnet to two-bit spammers and scammers, crooks, thieves, and blackmailing fraudsters, you could do a number of other neat things with it. Think of Victor as \"ковбой\", cowboy, or better still, a cattle baron, his botnet his dairy herd, and the Internet as the Great Plains filled with grass, free for the browsing.Well, wait, wait, wait a minute, how big of a botnet are we talking about? Well, at one point, it's estimated that Conficker enslaved around 9 million computers, creating quite possibly something approaching the biggest platform on the planet. Oh, companies came up with anti-viral software to purge it, and institutions and businesses have wiped it off of their systems, but actually, it's still around. It's estimated by this guy to average at six and a half million PCs, marshaling a formidable eighteen million CPUs, and capable of generating 28 trillion bytes per second of bandwidth.That's quite a cloud. The next biggest cloud is Google, with a measly 8% of capacity and processing power. Conficker is not a worm. Not anymore. Conficker is a Thing. A very, very big Thing, and this Thing is never, ever going to go away.If you wanted to get rid of this Thing, what could you do? Well, create a bigger Thing to smush it, I guess. That's about it. And some people would like to do that, because they feel that this Thing out there represents a threat to freedom of information, and free access, and all that other technocrat-utopian  crystal rainbows and marshmallow unicorns stuff that we all wish would happen.But it won't happen. That Thing out there? It's not going away. And it's doing stuff. It's processing stuff. It's active. We don't what it's doing, but it's doing something.Should you be scared? Nah.If you spent all your time worrying about every existential threat that could befall you, why, you'd be paralyzed into inaction. This is just another annoyance. Or maybe not. Maybe it's just the way the future is. All I know is, unlike the movie \"The Thing\", this monster chose the respectable route. It lives net door, and, like the Munsters, might not be a good neighbor, but really hasn't done anything to call the cops out. Victor may let us all know one of these days what kind of Thing he pwns. But I don't think he wants to wreck anything, not while he's making a good living off of it."},
{"title": "The Space Opera Ain't Over 'Til the Fat Alien Sings", "date": "Friday, November 18, 2011", "text": "Not sure why, but lately, people in Russia have been actively searching for this blog's URL. Not sure what that all that is about, but to my curious Russian friends, I say \"Привет!\"I'd say more, but my college Russian is really rusty, and about all I remember now is obscenities and, you know, phrases like: \"The pencil is on the table\" or \"Your sister is very hot\".(Although I am told that my spoken Russian is impressively native-sounding. A big shout-out to my former professors at Indiana University for stressing correct pronunciation).In the previous essay, in my response to observation on intelligence being the absence of stupidity, Barry queries: \"Isn't dark the absence of light?\"A ZPE FormulaWell, you know, Barry, that all was just metaphor, not to mention anthropomorphic metaphor, but, no. No. There is no such thing as dark. If one examines what the emptiest empty is, one finds out that this state is called the Zero Point Energy state. This can be empirically demonstrated through the Casimir effect. And in fact, a much more dramatic experiment has recently been conducted where light was created out of a vacuum. Sadly, harvesting the Zero Point Energy violates Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle, but this has not stopped bad science fiction scriptwriters or crank inventors from utilizing it.But you know when it comes to bad science fiction, space opera is up there. I'm not ashamed to admit that I can't enough of that. And I've often considered a realistic space opera story. You know, one that obeys the laws of physics, or at least recognize the established physical limits?Some say it can't be done. They claim such a story would be boring.Take the speed of light limit. (Yes, I know, they claim to have broken the light barrier, but I suspect some unknown characteristic about neutrinos that is much more interesting). It eliminates the whole Horatio Hornblower in Space treatment favored by the likes of Star Trek. Difficult to keep the plot moving when it (optimistically) takes decades or centuries to move a scene or episode from one interstellar location to the next. It either calls for a new cast every episode (generation ships), or an immortal - and incredibly patient and persistent - cast of characters. Is that it? Is that about the only road block to space opera? Well, yeah, within the context of a TV series or a Hollywood movie, yes.Are there other limits to worry about? Well, perhaps, although it is hard to see how it would affect a story line. Some could put a damper on technological progress for us and any aliens that are out there.That emptiest empty, that puts the kibosh on free energy.Coldest cold? Absolute zero. You can only suck so much energy out of something. Again you run into Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle with that, but it still allows you to do cool things with Bose-Einstein condensates, and perform all sorts of optical tricks, possibly for computing (and also living into the bleakness of cold, thin soup era of the universe after the end of the all-too-brief Stellar Age). But effects on space opera? None, I think.Densest dense? Well, neutron star dense, as far as we know, and applications effected might be for data storage. Although again QM suggests no information is lost in a black hole. In which case the ultimate servers and nodes for the Cosmic Internet are those supermassive black holes at the heart of quasars.Smallest small? I don't know. Plan on shrinking anything? That plot device really verges more on fantasy, and anyway is of limited dramatic potential. It does put a limit on just fast data can be processed, or how closely something can be scanned. The old teleporter may not need the granular resolution of the Planck length, but that's your strict limit. (And if it turns successful matter transmission requires a scan length/time less than the smallest small, then no beaming down to planets).Here's one that actually may be important: the hottest hot. Theoretically (depending on who you talk to), you can go all the up to 10 to the 30th degrees kelvin. That's... that's pretty hot. Although practically, you are limited to about 4 billion degrees C before you start to see virtual particle/antiparticle pair creation kick in. This again, if you are needing to transmit something over a small volume or bandwidth, like information or teleported objects, can get into trouble. (If for example, to incorporate all the information, you need a 14 petawatt laser beam confined to .001 millimeter aperture to beam your crew to the surface of a planet, then it, ooh, it gets messy and ugly).Astrofood by Waldemar von Kozak On an unrelated note, in keeping with the theme, a British company named Shackelton Energy plans on setting up Moon mines by 2020.  I assume they will want to use robots more extensively than they plan on doing. The idea is to mine the Moon's estimated billions of tons of buried water ice at the poles to manufacture rocket fuel. Presumably, it would be better to wait on that, and consider perhaps that the future may find a wiser use for these one-time resources? No?Oh well, perhaps by 2020 most people will be too fat to be ferried to the Moon. Americans, at least.Hah! Stupid, fat, lazy, dumb, stupid, fat Americans! You're fat!"},
{"title": "S = k ln W", "date": "Thursday, November 17, 2011", "text": "Herr B's gravestone in Vienna, AustriaThe title of this essay is the Boltzmann equation. It is carved upon his gravestone in the same cemetery where Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, and the Strauss family are also buried.  The form of the equation inscribed on his tomb was actually first written by Max Planck, but that's fine as the original equation written in 1872 by Herr B contains partial derivatives which are hard to carve in stone.The terms such that where S is the entropy of a system, it can be described by the Boltzmann Constant k (1.38067 joules per degree kelvin) multiplied by natural logarithm of W, which is the number of states accessible to that system. In plain English, the entropy of a system is determined by the number of ways that the system's components can be arranged. If we are dealing with a gas, it is the number of ways the gas particles can float around, interact, and collide with each other. It's a very, very, very, very large number of ways, so to get the numbers into a manageable form (read small numbers small enough for tiny brains to handle), you take the logarithm of it. This equation links entropy to probability. And, in a roundabout fashion I have no time to explicate, it also has something to do with thermodynamics, and the so-called 2nd Law.Yeah, and so what? Well, this equation, along with Boltzmann's contribution of a statistical approach to the kinetic theory of gases, and still more, supplies the very broad shoulders that allow Max Planck et al to stand upon. It pointed the way for the development of Quantum Mechanics - by far the most successful set of theories ever developed.And there's more. Once the American electrical engineer, Claude Shannon, grabbed ahold of Boltzmann's concepts, and developed his own version of Herr B's H-function and the term entropy, then the whole field of information theory opened up. (Although it should be noted that Mr. Shannon's claim that information theoretic entropy is the same as statistical entropy is in dispute in some circles).Finally we get to the weird stuff. When Shannon investigated the informational aspects of communications,  he found that a message transmitted with optimal efficiency over a channel of limited bandwidth looks exactly like random noise. Not surprising when you think about it. A message with the largest choice of arrangements will have the highest probability of not being degraded in all arrangements. So, the more random, the more likely to get through (whatever it is, noise, interference, etc.)Not to be confused with...Black-body power curve When applied to a message broadcast over the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e. using an EM transmission medium) the most information-efficient format is indistinguishable from noise or 'static' (or, if you prefer, it will resemble black-body radiation).   Okay. And um, so...? So, uh, what do we know is all static? Shit on the TV? How about quasars? OR the cosmic microwave background? Could it be we are getting messages beamed to us all the time, and we are just too stupid to figure it out? (Oh, as far as my contention that intelligence as such does not exist? That stupidity is a real universal force. And that, just as 'cold' is the absence of heat, so  'intelligence' is the absence of stupid, well, I do really need to go on? Like Shannon entropy, there are very few ways to do the smart thing, but a very, very, very, very large number of ways to fuck things up. QED)."},
{"title": "What if they held a Singularity, and nobody came?", "date": "Wednesday, November 16, 2011", "text": "Brain Injury Map: I think I took a hit to the PhonicsIt's apocryphal and no doubt bullshit, but I once heard that you lose 10 IQ points every time you suffer a concussion.Which means I am one knock on the head away from being a chipmunk. I'll be looking to squirrels and birds for advice after the next one.This essay may actually come close to being a random walk. Not because I've suffered a concussion and can't think properly, but because I've four or five topics I want to cover and can't decide. I 'll just split this up into a number of essays. I guess that would the logical thing to do, but...I got a big old knot right behind my left ear from slipping and falling on ice and planting my head right onto a metal stair rail.It fucking hurt.I mean, the kind of hurt where all you can do is just sit there and make that the spittle inhale sound and and a \"AHH!\" exhale, and let the entire universe revolve around that hot spot of pain. The kind of hurt where you've got to wait at least a minute before the profanity starts up. The kind of hurt where if someone asks you if you are OK, you tell them the truth. \"No, I'm not OK, you stupid asshole!\"I'm guessing that big old bump is right above the superior temporal sulcus. Judging from the brain injury map, I really don't need to have this area damaged again, and I'll tell you why.When I was in the 4th grade, I had really a bad fever. And when I came out of it and got back to school, the teacher noticed I was talking louder than normal. They brought in the hearing test guy, Mr. Carpenter. Mr. Carpenter determined that I had a hearing loss, specifically in the upper registers, from nerve damage. The damage made it difficult to understand conversation, especially with background noise. Later, after realizing I could not understand song lyrics on the radio, I suspected the nerve damage had been more than just loss of the ability to hear higher frequencies, but that I had difficulty recognizing word sounds. In other words, the damaged area wasn't the nerves in the ear, but in the brain. I've often wondered what an fMRI would reveal? A dead zone?In any case, this, plus an ability to think only with pictures, makes me suspect that language is overrated.But that's not what I want to talk about.Recently, Paul Allen thinks that Ray Kurzweil is dead wrong about the Singularity. Ray Kurzweil, in turn, thinks that Paul Allen does not have the first clue, and that the Singularity is still on schedule to occur on or about 2045. Personally, Kurzweil's personal quest for uploading suggests to me that he does not get laid often enough. Not that I think he's hopelessly wretched, but rather he lives too much up inside his head. Ray is so concerned about the mind is brain metaphor that he forgets that the mind is the body, not just the brain.Here's the deal. For the past few months, I've changed my workouts to include a lot more core exercises. You know, working on the trunk, the abs, obliques, back and buttocks. And I must say, my core is vastly improved. So much so, that I am quite the fucking machine. Working on all those muscles down in that area have really got me in shape for that kind of activity.Hmm, not really sure if I'm getting this across properly.Now, that there's some fancy fuckingLet's take one back extension exercise, designed to improve the lower back, which basically sets you up to fuck a Swiss ball. Not only fucking, but, with your hands behind your head, some professional porn Olympics fancy fucking. That type of activity, where you are doing much more than just the mechanical motion, but paying close attention to the form, the experience of the form, the experience of the motion, the experience of the combination of pain and pleasure, effort, and exertion, that type of activity is what Life is all about. How Life should be lived. Aware and active. Not that Zen Buddha detached bullshit. But a whole body and mind involved experience - wallowing like a pig in mud in the world, the flesh, and all the iterated reflections thereof and thereupon.If Kurzweil thinks he can just do a physical scan of his brain, his connectome, his chemical orchestration, and leave it that, why, I suspect he ends up a head in a jar. In other words, he is more than just his brain, he is brain  plus body, plus experiences, plus memory, plus life. And quite frankly, I suspect if you want to be able to handle experiences as esoteric and fulfilling in an uploaded computer state, you should at least completely replicate that wonderful whole body experience of fucking. But that's not what I want to talk about.The one assumption I've noticed about the Vingean or Kurzweillian Singularity is that they require superintelligent computers to be created for it all to go down.I question that assumption. It strikes me as unnecessary. My current working definition of the Singularity is, quite simply: \"All bets are off\". In other words, you cannot predict the after from the before.Example: Life. Before life occurred on planet Earth, you had inorganic chemical processes occurring. True, they could be complicated. True, they may or may not have had feedback loops. But the thing is, there was probably (can't say for sure, wasn't there) did not have metabolism, or balanced disequilibria, or replication, or reproduction, or any of those things that we characterize as Life. and then afterwards, however the hell it happened, you have, wow, all that amazing shit, that organic chemistry we call Life. Before, dead as hell and boring. Afterwards, trending from the before, why, not a clue, not a hint.Didn't. See. That. Coming. No. Sir. Ree.Ah, question. Any intelligent design involved in that? I'm betting no.So, why the need for hyperintelligence now for the next big thing?"},

{"title": "Design Freeze", "date": "Wednesday, November 9, 2011", "text": "Briefly, because I have worked a 12 hour day and want to go home and take a shower. Get the smell of sweat and copper off me.But I feel need to share what the manic/depressive cycle of art making has currently churned out. And it is a manic/depressive cycle for me. Two very dry years, and now, all of a sudden, I've no time at all to anything but make art. And it doesn't help that my regular job is getting in the way.A number of years ago, we at the college were fortunate enough to have a fellow named Dan Lane who made art here. He used to teach at the Art Institute of Chicago, doing illustration and design. He was retired when I met him, making all sorts of interesting shadow boxes and things out of, well, pretty much anything that came to hand.Dan was my hero.Eighty-eight years old at the very end, and still cranking out art, and the art he was making was just... kicking ... my ass.When his wife died, I figured, well, that's it. Dan has got a few months in him, and like all old birds that lose their mate, he'll fall off the cliff. That seems to be the way it is with men. They just fall off the cliff.Women linger. They lose their husbands, and they just keep going. So Dan was a surprise. He managed a good two years past his wife's death.Of course, eventually he slowed down, and then he started to stop eating. I tried to make him eat. I'd bring soup and bread from the school cafeteria, which makes really good soup and chili.  I'd always make sure there was lots of butter for the bread. And after a while, he wouldn't eat it. He was ready to die, and I was trying to make him live. He got mad at me about that. So, after awhile, I realized how selfish I was, and I succumbed to his wishes.Other people tried to keep him alive, but then he died.Anyway, I remember a story he told me about a student he had at SAIC who he said was just brilliant. The kid was a natural, a visual genius, and could just crank out the most spectacular designs, and there was a bright future ahead for him. And then the kid froze. He got so tangled up and fussy that eventually he couldn't even produce a design. He would just stare at blank paper. And that was the end of the kid's art career. He was afraid to produce anything that wasn't perfect.Now, reason I mention this is I think that is what I've been going through the past two years. Part of the problem at least. The dry spell has been a case design freeze. Failure to launch. So, now, having at least recognized this particular problem (and who knows what the next kink in the knot will be), I am trying to crank out as much shit as I can, and not worry to much about whether it's good or not, or been done before, or is original, or what have. Because if it is any of those things, why, I can just recycle the metal and start over.So, I've been casting metal like crazy all week, to get my stuff out of the way (in anticipation of the class molten metal pour this coming Saturday), and trying to grind, sand, and patina bronze pieces. I still have about thirty pieces to go, and how to present them and all that stuff.But anyway, here is the raw footage of some of the stuff, presented without further comment."},

{"title": "We are the 99%...", "date": "Thursday, November 3, 2011", "text": "... if by 99% you mean percentage of species now extinct, and you add the qualifier 'eventually'.There are days when I think, \"You know what? We're fucked. We are just circling the drain\". This is one of those days, and not for any particular circumstance or feeling or mood, but more on just a specific influx of information.Now, does this mean I give up? No way. I think that whatever hope that died years ago with the realization that we have probably trashed the planet past the point where it will support us in the manner we (we being Americans, of course) are accustomed to, that hope has been replaced with a stubborn cussedness. I just heave a big old sigh and just wait to see how bad bad can get. And when I say \"trashed the planet\", this is not to say we've trashed the planet. Far from it. Planet's a mean old monster, shake us off like a bad case of fleas (as George Carlin once said). Or, more if you prefer your Will Durant: \"Civilization exists by geologic consent, subject to change without notice\".And when I say \"trashed the planet\", this is not to say we as a species are threatened with extinction. Far from it. We are an opportunistic omnivorous generalist species. Things will have to get really, really bad to wipe us all out.When I say \"trashed the planet\", this is to say that we have just completely fucking trashed our rental apartment, punched holes in walls, allowed bathtubs to overflow, strewn empties in corners, smeared feces in rugs, pissed on the couch during naps, set carpets ablaze, and, in short, and we won't receiving any of our deposit back.So what put me into such a wonderful mood? For starters, it might be this quote, from Richard Ellis, author of Hive Mind:People believe in their hearts that a piece of raw fish is worth $600 a plate. And one of the main reasons it's worth $600 is because you can afford it and I can't, but they can. That makes it very special, and it makes the people who eat it special. Any kind of luxury goods largely come from that sort of statement: I can afford it, and you can't. I'll drive a Maserati, even if I can't drive it faster than 65 miles per hour in most of the United States. I can afford a $280,000 car, and you're stuck with a Dodge Neon. I can fly a private jet, drive a Maserati, do anything I bloody well please, including having a $600 piece of fish. And you can't. And this is the brutal truth: bluefin, which beyond their intrinsic value as living creatures happen to be one of the universe's more majestic species, a Platonic ideal of oceanic speed and grace, aren't being extinguished by greed. They're being sacrificed to our vanity, pretension, and ostentation - most pathetic of  our vices.Ellis is talking about the bluefin tuna, overfished to the brink of extinction. Given that it is a much prized delicacy, the sensible thing to do would be to quit fucking fishing it and give the population a chance to recover, but instead its rarity puts into even greater demand. We are told (although there is some debate going on) that Comet Chicxulub wiped out the dinosaurs. Comet Chicxulub is estimated to have had the explosive power of a hundred trillion tons of TNT.There are larger impact craters. The Sudbury crater in Canada is twice as big, and impact that created the Vredefort Crater in South Africa - the largest verified impact crater - is estimated to have been ten times Chicxulub.Sudbury and Vredefort both occurred some two billion years ago, back when nothing much was happening here anyway. It was \"just\" microbes back then, and nothing much happened to them.(Actually, more and more evidence is being compiled that these impact events really didn't do much in the way of hurting the planet. One wonders exactly how much of an effect the rather pathetic mere gigatons of the world's combined nuclear arsenals would have. And the answer is, we'd get our hair mussed, but the hysterics of all life wiped out is a bit much).So what do you need to get a really good extinction event going? Well, not counting the disappearance of Ice Age megafauna to hunter/gatherers (and to be fair, you can't rule out climate change as a factor), you have to go with agriculturalists. The last ten thousand years have seen an increasingly rapid extinction rate that is unparalleled in the fossil record. Yes, even the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the Mother of all Extinction Events is getting a run for it's money.And it's all due to, global nuclear war? Supervolcanoes? Hyper greenhouse event from giant burps of methane ice? Comet strike? Nope, little old us. With our land clearing, our pets, our vermin, our diseases, our pests.  Is it too late? There are days when I think, nope, we got maybe a decent chance. Maybe, if we can pull our heads out of asses, we can turn things around.BUT, they are very specific heads pulled out of very specific asses that are needed, and this may require massive surgical intervention.Then there are days, like today, when I think, nope, the turning point was August 14th, 1975. That was the perigee of our existence, and everything after that is a let down.I could be wrong. Check back with me tomorrow. Because there is that stupid intense little gamma ray burst of cheerfulness stubbornly wedged in the center of my soul, even on days like this."},

{"title": "The Dragon-Kings", "date": "Friday, October 28, 2011", "text": "Back in the summer of 1977, I worked as a janitor in a magnet factory. After the first half-hour there, being shown my duties, I was pretty much on autopilot for the next three months. I could have used the time to really develop my dope-taking skills, but there were just a little too many industrial hazards in the place to make that a valid activity.Fortunately, someone in the break room had an appetite for science and technology.  I'd find magazine issues of Science Digest, Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, and the occasional Aviation Week or Scientific American. An article caught my eye about a NASA proposal to send automated factories to the Moon to create fuel depots and piles of prefab construction materials for future colonies and missions. Not just automated factories, mind you, but self-replicating automated factories that would produce fuel depots and construction materials as more-or-less excreted afterthoughts.The article referred to these self-replicating factories as \"robot farms\". (No doubt alluding to ant farms as an applicable association to get the self-replicating part across to the public). I thought about those robot farms whilst sweeping floors and burning trash through the summer months. In the spring semester just prior, I had taken classes in mathematical models and simulation, a FORTRAN programming class, and an interesting elective on microbiology. Not knowing a damned thing about the required machinery for robot farms,  the conditions on the surface of the moon, the composition of the lunar regolith, or even the amount of programming required to make a robot farm self-sustaining, I decided to figure out the theoretical - the ballpark number - aspects of the endeavor.I felt no need to investigate the actual specifics of the robot farm, but merely to treat it as a reproductive unit.  To stick with the ant farm metaphor, one would assume there would be different castes of machines. A specialized worker caste, obviously, to stripmine and gather minerals, smelt and separate the valuable materials, process, assemble, and store basic components. Perhaps an intermediate network caste - railroad, conveyer belt, and radio or telephone robots to link, coordinate, and ship materials and information around (as will be seen later, this might be the most important caste). And then their would be the reproductive caste, that would further construct the necessary robots, as well as program them. At the time, I was not aware of John von Neumann's investigations into self-replicating phenomena, in either the form of cellular automata, or machinery, but basically, this was the gist of it.And I assumed, since NASA was contemplating it, that plans for building these robot farms with materials available upon the Moon existed and were feasible (apparently, the robots would be mostly made of iron, titanium, and glass, based upon the composition of the lunar soil. Couple this with solar power - either as concentrated heat or converted electric, and your best bet is some type of silicon ecology). That NASA would use processes that could be used on the lunar surface (no carbon, no hydrogen, no water, but plenty of dust to gum things up, and sunshine, but also solar magnetic storms and flares and gamma and X- rays and things that really mess with electronics).  So all NASA needed was to, well, shoot some big magical metal seed pod up there and get the whole enterprise to going.As such, really, I just assumed the plans for the damned things would work out, and could concentrate on how - and how fast - they'd \"grow\". Treating one robot farm as a reproductive unit, a logical starting place was Fibonacci's rabbits. In 1202, Fibonacci thought about rabbit pairs producing. He assumed that they would take a certain amount of time to mature, and from then on out, they would breed. So, generation-wise, 1 pair would take time to mature, then produce another pair. The new pair takes a generation to mature, but the first pair continues to breed and makes another pair, and so you have 3 pairs. And then the first pair has another pair, and the now mature second pair breeds and has a pair, and now you have 5 pairs, and so on.Fibonacci RabbitsWhen you add up the numbers, you'd produce the Fibonacci sequence, and they'd go like:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55,  89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, 514229, 832040, 1346269,....So, after 30 generations, there would be more than a million machine complexes on the Moon. Give them ten square miles territory each, and that's 13 million square miles of strip mined golden goodness. Keep in mind, the Moon's surface area is around 14 million square miles, that's something. Throw in some generation time number - a month or a year or even a decade, and the Moon is over run with machines and the material instrumentalities of human civilization in a very short time span, compared to its geologic life.But, like the Drake Equation, these are all fairly silly and arbitrary numbers that don't really mean anything. First of all, notice that Fibonacci's rabbits are immortal. If rabbits die, that slows down the sequence some. For example, if a pair dies after, say, three generations, then the sequence is 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, etc.Mother and DaughtersSomething like that occurs just through geography. As mother farms send out a daughter farm, the logical, or obvious, arrangement to share surface resources ends up looking like a bee's honeycomb, since the densest packing of circles is hexagonal. A mother farm sends out daughter farms equidistant to her, and after six generations, she has nowhere to send the next, provided she can only start adjacent daughters. (This may seem an arbitrary restriction, but geography and transport play a role in this). Things get worse for the daughter farms. If we restrict colonizing to adjacent territories, daughter farms quickly run out of places for their own children. This is a geometric consequence of expansion. An expanding circle sees its area increase faster than its circumference. The ratio of circumference to area, as radius increases is 2 π r  / π r 2, which simplifies to 2/r.  As r tends to infinity, 2/r goes to zero. (Well, no, not zero, but a really, really, really tiny number). This decreasing ratio is the same problem that animals face with the surface area to volume ratio. For an increasingly large volume, it is difficult to bring in nutrients, or materials, through a (relative to size) increasingly smaller surface area. This is probably why there are no 30 foot long bacteria sliding around...In any case, I'd assume NASA would have some stop code in the reproductive stack for those geographic reasons. Not to mention the fact that the lunar surface will not be uniform in resources. Some areas will be a horn of plenty, others sparse and penurious, and the honeycomb will be anything but regular. Then there is the fact that machines break down, and if enough components, workers, assembler what have you, fail, the whole farm fails and dies. So, no, even in the most optimistic fantasy scenario would you see the Moon populated with a robot ecology in a year, or a decade, or a century.Pen and Ink Robot Farm SimulationSince I did not have access to a computer (and affordable home PCs were still some years in the future), I filled up a notebook with graphic simulations, not to mention at one point I took over the dining room table and represented the robot farm \"states\" with coins. I still can't believe my parents put up with it for two weeks. The notebooks are gone, but a sample page would something like this (perhaps best viewed through hemp-remediated brain to get the idea): Hemp, or more accurately, herb, being the operative descriptor for this examination.Another term that comes to mind would be Monte Carlo masturbation.As is often the case with a general mathematical analysis, even a substandard one as this, no significant insights or profound revelations come from anything like this. (Indeed, my high school leanings towards numerical Platonism were completely quashed by investigations into higher mathematics. Once you realize that the best models are little better than toys, that empirical observations of the the thing itself is the best simulation of all, the maths quickly lose their shine. Mathematics may be more than just counting, but not much else).Graph of a Logistic Equation In retrospect, I could have just spent three minutes looking at a logistic equation and been done with the whole thing. Of course, a logistic equation is kind of a dumb shit itself, if you don't know what the population growth (r) or carrying capacity of the environment (K) is, and that is the unknown factor that you want to find out.Fortunately, there was that microbiology class I mentioned at the beginning of this essay to draws from. Interestingly, for an intro class, it was taught by a full professor. In retrospect, he was on his way out, towards retirement, had a few heretical ideas about evolution, and was therefore, relegated to the academic gulag. Still and all, he was a smart fucker, and he talked about things that only now are being considered.Oh, sure, he presented the usual accepted canon of the Darwinian fundamentalists, with the singular gene and in sole and supreme primacy for inheritance, and yet the old guy also talked of how often singular microbes talked to each other - through shared RNA rings, diffusible molecules, proteins, and peptides and who knows all what else. The amount of chatter at the cellular level - quorum sensing, eavesdropping on competitors, synchronizing with collaborators, not only between members of the same species, but also across species, is really quite astounding, and probably a trillionfold-plus the amount of electromagnetic chatter we humans engage in. Not to mention things like biofilms, which seem to serve all sorts of mysterious multicellular purposes. Teams of things, groups of things, were far more interesting and compelling area of study. The old prof was not quite ready to commit to Lamarckian mechanism or teleological impetus, but there was clearly some sort of purpose to all this.   It wasn't until my return to college that I got to spend time in the computer lab to run simulations. The problem is, I really didn't know what I wanted to simulate, or even what the equations would look like to do it. As Richard Hamming famously said \"Many a physicist has gotten the right number with the wrong equation\". Multiply that sage observation for \"wrong mathematical model\". I had experienced this in my prior spring semester's \"Mathematical Models and Simulations\" when I was assigned to replicate the population model of a simple marine ecosystem with the Lotka-Volterra equations - only to find that these equations did not accurately model the ecosystem. (The \"prey\" adults ate the \"predator\" babies, and thus a key coupled feedback parameter was lacking from the equations). Way too many hours wasted on this shitPlus, those slippery network connections that the old microbiology prof had talked about were dancing in my head. I knew that I was dealing with some kind of power law scenario here (and, what with Benoit Mandelbrot having just coined the term \"fractal\" a mere three years before, I was clueless on that particular front as well).I would have to turn to discrete structures, combinatorics and graph theory for the answers I wanted. Late night computing ended up being all about hemp-flavored Star Trek games on terminals connected to the mainframe computer. Suffice to say, I was never quite up to the task, but what I lacked in quantitative analysis I made up for in qualitative, and a judicious use of highly unscientific inductive thing.Long story short, it came down to this. A networked system of robot farms would look a lot less like a superorganism of an ant colony, or for that matter, the loosely linked organism of a sponge or a jellyfish, and a lot more like a multicellular organism of an animal, or actually, more like a... nervous system. Yeah. Like a brain. And that sent a little thrill of fear through me the first time I thought of it, I can tell that much. Herr Gauss's BellSo, thinking, on average, about what a typical sample of such a thing would, perhaps, a Hebbian or neural network, I figured the average behavior would not be a sample that could be described by a Gaussian distribution, a bell curve, but, given the power law characteristics, something that would have a fatter tail (keep in mind, this is me describing my thinking back then now).It's only lately that I've found the term I didn't have back then to describe what I saw in head. Here's bascially what I saw. A robot ecology up on the stark surface of the Moon slowly and painfully gains a small foothold. Over time, all the little components, working together, working along a code that NASA wisely saw fit to allow to self-optimize, talking to each other about hazards and bonanzas, mileposts, and breakthroughs and setbacks, for the longest time is a small silicon ecology, and then, with a sudden effloresence, blossoms and blooms into... something else entirely. And it, this event, though I did not know it then, I would now call a technological or Vingean singularity. The difference, though, and this is important, is that whereas Vinge and his predecessors relied upon some type of intelligence to see it through, I saw that this particular disruptive event would require no Intelligent Design. It was all strictly through ratcheted happenstance.And the other term I was lacking? To describe this world-changing paroxysm?I have finally have a term for it, it would be a Dragon-King Event.All my silly reductive analysis would not have caught any of it: \"By cutting the mammoth in pieces, we observe only mice\"."},

If hats are back, I want to see hat etiquette back as well.I've never been a hat person. Coming of age after the sixties, when the hat started to disappear from the men's fashion landscape, let alone after the proletarian clothing revolution of the 70s, there was just never any call for the wearing of a hat.And I don't include the baseball cap in the category of hat wearing. Let's be clear on my opinions on this. There is a difference between a cap and a hat. The former is worn by children. The latter by adults. Aw!But, as I say, with the proletarian revolution, caps are now the new hats. I myself am a strict adherent of the revolutionary canon. If I could I'd show you a picture taken of me when I was about five or six years of age, you'd see that I am wearing the same clothes now. Jeans, T-shirt, tennis shoes. Given a choice this is the default mode.Still, since about a year ago I received a gift from a friend in the form of a baseball cap, and I've taken to wearing one. But I also am following hat wearing etiquette, even if it is a child's cap.So, here's an old school website for hat etiquette. I've modified the rules to suit myself. For example, the rules involved to \"greet a superior\", on the street, in calling indoors, or in passing, I strictly ignore, as no man is my superior. So forget that shit. Here are my rules:1) When to remove your hat: When entering indoors, such as a home, restaurant, library, movie theater, school, office, or place of worship. Entering into a public buildings or events, such as a post office, grocery store, airport, sporting event, etc. does not require at removal. Rather than list all contingencies, the rule of thumb I took was: a man does not remove a hat where he does not seat himself. The hat is also removed when the national anthem is played, or when the flag is presented in parade.2) When to tip or doff a hat: Always when greeting a lady as a sign of respect. Rather than list all possibilities, the rule of thumb I adopt is that a man tips or doffs his hat in situations where he would say \"Excuse me\", or  \"Thank you\". 3) All around advice. Keep the hat clean. Never display the inside of the hat when tipping or greeting."},
{"title": "Does Intelligence Have Survival Value?", "date": "Thursday, October 20, 2011", "text": "Possibly short-term, at least for the East African Plains Ape, but long-term? I mean, as a modern species, we've been around for perhaps 200,000 years or so, and yet we are precipitating a once in a 100 million year extinction event. Part of it kicked off when we had nothing more than stone, wood, and leather to work with (the Ice Age megafauna extinctions). Seeing as I'm a direct descendent of the pioneers who wiped out the Neanderthal, the dire wolf, the giant cave lion, and giant cave bear, I'm perversely proud of that. (Although I'm sure my ancestors would look at me, an above-average 21st century physical specimen, as a chicken-boned wimp with a tiny brain. Not very big. Not very strong. Not very clever.) Point being, I've really to wonder about intelligence as a long-term survival trait. And the theme today is, has it happened before? All those mass extinction events in the fossil record, all due to \"natural' causes?The late Ordovician, life still bound to the sea, and 50% of it wiped out. Mostly trilobites and invertebrates, but some primitive jawless fishes, and straight-shelled cephalopods in shallow tropical waters, with the vast Panthalassic Ocean spread over the entire Northern Hemisphere. Did the continent of Gondwana park itself at the South Pole, causing catastrophic glaciation, lowering the sea level and eliminating whole swathes of habitable shallow? Or did some intelligent cephalopods get too smart for their own good? Very difficult to develop any kind of technological civilization under water, but then, I'm thinking like a plains ape, with fire and smelted metals and dry sticks and stones ready to hand. Why not build tools out of modified life? Who says you can't create a bacterium to generate electricity, radio waves, nuclear fission? Not me. It could have happened.The late Devonian, another 50% wipeout, and again primarily marine. Animals still stuck in the ocean, save for early tetrapods, but land plants have developed to create their special form of havoc. Did a clever relative of Ancanthostega manage to screw the pooch (anachronistically speaking) upon landfall? Or did the tentacled ones manage a second chance, only to blow it?The Big One. The End Permian. 250 million years ago. 96% of all marine species. 70% of all land vertebrates. Was it a comet? A continental United States sized volcanic eruption now known as the Siberian Traps? Super global warming from the coal deposits burned by said eruptions? Temperature extremes from the forming of the supercontinent Pangaea? Revenge of the hydrogen sulfide excreting purple bacteria? A combination of all of the above? Or was it one of the mammal's ancestors, a therapsid with a too much brain and not enough sense? One over time able to manipulate rocks into rockets, and thence to tip them with nuclear barbs? Would there even be a fossil record for that?The end Triassic. Kind of disappointing as extinctions go, but still a respectable 48% death rate. it is thought to be due to the some two million cubic kilometers of magma released during the Central Atlantic breakup, along with two quadrillion kilograms of sulfur di- and trioxide molecules. But then again, it might have been an early dinosaur with a big brain. The Cretaceous. Well, everyone knows it was Comet Chicxulub, right? The \"tail of the devil\" went smacko, whacko, slapping right into the ocean north of the Yucatan with an explosive force of 100 million megatons of TNT. Or could it have been some feathered serpents? Some smart version of Quetzalcoatl mucking up the timeline with a fissile slugfest with some other mythical power? And throw in a little peyote to get the whole Mexican flavored apocalyptic vision quest to going?Which brings us full circle to the present. Or did I leave out the Oxygen Crisis of 2.5 billion years ago? Well, those of us In The Know, know it was the Spirochete Conspiracy. Yeah, Penrose's (if you buy into Penrose, which I don't, but never deny a source of entertainment) quantum-minded microtubules, not quite entirely tamed into eukaryotes yet."},

Want to play the bonus round? Try for Isfahan?You got nothing.I tried uploading videos using the school's Piece of Shit IMac, and quite frankly, Steve Jobs blows, and his products (software products at least) are shit.That's what I think.So, anyway, I tried to give you an artisan's eye view here in the videos (I believe it's also called gonzo, or monkeycam video). Unfortunately, it would not all load properly and so I will offset the video with a textual description as well. But first, here's the setup I threw together in about ten minutes to get that crittercam experience to working:The E coli bugs, the ones with the spermy tails, were made from a mold I made from some plastic jelly bean candy containers I found in the grocery store a couple years ago around Easter time. You soak the plaster mold in water. You pour molten wax into the mold. Let the wax skin up a bit over the course of a minute or so, pour the excess wax back out into the wax pot. Here's a video of that plaster mold:Here's a quick video of my wax tools. Some of my wax tools:Note in particular the carbon encrusted mini spatula like tool made from a piece of welding rod. This is the hot tool I use most often for \"welding\" pieces of wax together. You heat it up in the flame of an alcohol lamp, and apply it to the wax. I was not able to upload the latter part of the final video, which shows me using this tool to finish up the attachment of one of the tendrils to the jelly bean body, but you get the general idea. The touch and timing component here is key, learned from experience, as to how long you can apply the tool to melt the wax, as well as the interaction between gravity and the surface tension of wax to avoid drips and spills. It is part of the reason it would be very nice for the learner to experience what the artisan is doing. I think the combination of visual and haptic data would cut the learning time down by a considerable amount. The only thing better, of course, would be a download of my 20 years experience. Maybe. But then, if you can do that, what's the point? Right?Right?Anyway, here's the monkeycam video. It felt really weird manipulating the tools through the camera, but I could get used to it: A final video, in which I attach a sperm tail to a jelly bean utilizing fire and a hot knife: (Oh, and by the way, I just heard from Kohler! I was... rejected! 349 proposals for 16 slots. Eh! So what. Try again for next year)."},

I don't even why we have mirror neurons. But I just like the alliterative phrase. And here's what it would be.Well, actually, I think it was brought up in a comment over at Mr. Nulan's Liminal Perspective on Consensual Reality which got me to thinking. And danged if I can find the comment now, but it was basically an invitation through various electronic remediative devices to engage in a Tine Experience.Although actually no. Vernor Vinge's alien race, the Tines, were these doglike creatures that collectively formed one individual. Kind of like the Borg, but without the technical implants. This was all biological, thoughts shared through sounds. Rather than a Tine experience, which would subsume the individual into something larger, this is more like, just a highly integrated form of Call of Duty multiplayer video game. Or so I suppose. I've never played it.In any case, let's cut to my chase. Teaching how to work with a material, be it whether I'm glassblowing, or blacksmithing, or throwing pots, or carving wax, I know that the prime method is mimicry. The little monkey mirror neurons are firing so hard and fast in my student's heads you can practically here the static. This causes me to constantly practice the fundamentals so that the students will not immediately pick up bad habits. And I often repeat basic movements again and again until they get it.How much easier, I wonder, would they get it if they could be me.  If they could, through electronic sensory devices follow my gaze, feel the weights in my hands, judge the shifting of my posture, all the while I'm talking.

I would probably agree that the world would be very different without the likes of Mao, Stalin, Hitler, Lenin, Napoleon, Alexander, etc. etc. But without the likes of Edison? Gates? Steve Jobs? Here's a counterfactual for you. Let's say Steve Jobs is killed in an auto accident in 1979. In the year 2010, do we have the iPod, the iPad, the iMac, Pixar films, iTunes?Answer? Yes. They all just wouldn't be called that. They all probably would not be as sharp and slick looking either.Because, yes, you guessed it. I'm being contrary about the notion that Steve Jobs was the Edison of our times. I'm not alone. Some are offended by this opinion. I have no idea why.I do recognize that Steve Jobs had a sense of style and slick design.Now, I have to be introspective enough to ask \"Is this an envious post?\" Only in the sense that Herman Cain calls the Occupy Wall Street protestors envious. In other words, no, and fuck you for suggesting that you fat ugly old asshole. (Herman, not you, dear reader).But I do object to this uncritical hyperbole around Jobs the man. This undue reverence and worship doesn't do anyone any favors. Not Jobs, not you and me, and certainly not history. Let's get the facts right. Jobs did not invent the mouse. Jobs did not invent the GUI interface. Jobs did not invent the laptop computer with a screen interface. Jobs did not invent the personal data assistant that you could call people on. Want to see amazing first-order innovations? Go to Israel. Go to Finland. Don't go to Cupertino.And private investors did not put in the initial seed monies to make these things happen. All that blue sky shit would never, ever have been funded by timid private investors.The Defense Department funded it all. That's right, the US military is responsible. DARPA, mostly. Credit where credit is due. Let's be honest about it.Apple has been very good at integrating existing technology. If you wish to credit Jobs for recognizing these various innovations as potentially fruitful, I've no problem with that. But don't go making him into something he was not.

They have a cast iron foundry and a clay studio, and I had planned on utilizing both of them, making cope and drag sandcast molds for the iron, and plaster molds to slip cast porcelain. The obstacle for me in the application process was that you were supposed to come up with a concept for the works. Why can't I just make cool shit? No, there has to be some social value I guess.

Welike to think of ourselves as discrete individuals, but the fact of the matteris we are communities of cells - not only human cells, but bacterial cells aswell. It is estimated that there are ten times as many microbial cells in ourbodies as human cells.TheHuman Microbiome Project has recently identified perhaps a hundred times asmuch microbial genetic material as human within our bodies.Ourbodies can be viewed as entire worlds, with lush metaphorical rain forestswithin the gastrointestinal tract, and stark Sahara-like conditions on regionsof skin such as the forehead.Myintent would be to render these conditions using both cast iron and slip-castporcelain. The idea is to craft human anatomical or cellular portions in iron,and present an aura, or halo, of slip cast bacterial inhabitants of the humanhost community.Forexample, a piece could include a larger than life size portions of molars,gums, tongue, etc. along with the porcelain bacterial denizens associated withit.

I suppose it had to do with a passage I read about relative size of bacteria and human cells. Bacteria can range from .5 to 5 microns in length. Human cells average around 10 microns. But in average, you typical volume of human cell to bacteria is about the same, scaled up, as a house to a person, or better still, a trailer.Your standard trailer park trailerSo, that gave me the idea of a trailer park. I don't think I'll make the whole trailer park. I'll probably just make one trailer, but the trailer would be a morph of a trailer park trailer mobile home and a human cell.

Pretty much as they are, with no attempt to anthropomorphize them (they'd just look like Mr. Peanut anyway), but they would be cast iron. And the beautiful thing is, I can do it all with the college's facilities. I just need to buy a clay-lined crucible and some class 25 grey iron scrap, and I can work in cast iron with our furnaces.

{"title": "\"Les classes dangereuses\"", "date": "Thursday, October 6, 2011", "text": "Back in the early to mid-nineteenth century Paris, the bourgeoisie considered the lower classes to be most associated with criminals. Poverty and crime go hand in hand, so the thought went, and all those of the lower orders were considered, through this piece of logic, to be considered the Dangerous Classes.Dangerous to whom?In the agrarian ages, the dangerous classes were the peasantry, the landless laborers, the tenant farmers. In the early era of manufacture, the dangerous classes became the vagabond mechanics and displaced cottage artisans forced into the cities. In the heavy industrial age, the laborers in the factories became dangerous. Now, in the information age, the middle class, thrown into a precarious state, dispossessed of stable careers, is dangerous. And in the post-information age? In an era of intelligent (or at least highly skilled) robots and computers, will the upper middle class, the professionals, the degreed, the certified, the accredited,  join the ranks of the dangerous?Are you seeing a commonality here? Marx would have called it \"human capital\". The danger element is that the people who actually do all the fucking work, when deprived of this activity, can get into all sorts of mischief. The dangerous ones are the indispensable ones. Not individually indispensable, mind you, but as a class (unless and until you get the robots up and running) the ones who, surprise!, don't need any supervision to do their fucking job. And in the triumphalist Cold War victory message, that central planning doesn't work, that distributed, egalitarian, collective wisdom seems to work just fine all on its own without a planner, without a manager, without a director, without a chief executive officer, what are we to take from that?The only reason to have a financier, a venture capitalist, an entrepreneur, is not for their vision, not for their directives, not for their goals, or priorities, or agendas, but quite simply, for their monies?\"Give us your monies, shut the fuck up, stand aside out of the way and from underfoot, and we will make you some more monies, motherfucker\".That's dangerous. That's a genie not following orders. That's a Titan unbound. That's a team of wild horses. That's a rogue monster, unchained, unleashed, unpredictable. We are told, by the greasy advertisers and slick-as-spit public relations dweebs, that the natural order is for the rich to be self-servingly enlightened, and by doing so, create jobs for the rest of us. We, the idled layabouts, who, left to our own devices, would no doubt drown face down in the mud for lack of effort or thought to turn ourselves upright. These wonderful job creators provide all and everything that allow the dangerous to be productive and good and worthy as members of society.Wow, the only logical response to that is...Fuck you.Funny thing is, it's all about rules in the game, isn't it? As Duncan Watts argues in \"Everything is Obvious Once You Know the Answer\":\"...arguments about the so-called redistribution of wealth are mistaken in assuming that the existing distribution is somehow the natural state of things, from which any deviation is unnatural, and hence morally undesirable. In reality, every distribution of wealth reflects a particular set of choices that a society has made: to value some skills over others, to tax and prohibit some activities while subsidizing or encouraging other activities; and to enforce some rules while allowing other rules to sit on the books, or to be violated in spirit. All these choices can have considerable ramifications for who gets rich and who doesn't... but there is nothing \"natural\" about any of these choices, which are every bit a product of historical accident, political expediency, and corporate lobbying as they are of economic rationality or social desirability.\"One thing that should be taken from all this is that solutions are dynamic. All targets are moving targets.And those defenders of the status quo and the ruling class, by remaining inflexible, unbending in their support and beliefs, by standing still in the way of events, are, if history is any guide, sure to come to ruin."},
{"title": "The Fitness Seascape", "date": "Wednesday, October 5, 2011", "text": "How Quaint!Hell is a cold place. Ask anyone who has been cold and can't warm up. Hell is Cold. Ask my ancestors. They set Hell in a deep, dark place of ice and wet and cold. It might as well have been the bottom of the ocean. And when the end of days come, when the Twilight of the Gods is at hand, the Fimbulwinter comes, a winter that makes the Ice Ages look like umbrella drink tropical paradise, and the inhabitants of Hell storm the citadel of the gods in a huge ship made from the fingernails of the dead, scratched across the surface of ice of the now Moon-dead seas.Heat? Heat is to be welcomed. We East African Plains Apes, having evolved with sweat glands for that parched and arid million year landscape, can handle the heat. All we need is some wind to evaporate the sweat and cool us off. In fact, look at our descriptive terms for a light current of air - breeze, zephyr, melody. A puff. A waft. A whiff. A breath. A blessing. All hold the promise of refreshment and respite. Why even the sound evokes the feeling. A cool, cool breeze. Sweet, fresh, and sparkling clean.But that's not what I want to talk about. Neal Stephenson recently wrote an essay, \"Innovation Starvation\", decrying the slowing pace of innovation. I enjoy reading Stephenson's books, am sometimes engaged with certain of his ideas (or at least struck at how we have come to the same conclusions), appreciate his ability to spin an adventure yarn, am only occasionally disappointed in how his characters seem a bit too modern and hip and speak too often with Left Coast mannerisms, but on the whole consider him a pretty damn good author. But in this essay, I've got a lot to disagree with. More about that in a minute. Maybe.One of the things that often struck me as wrong, or wrong-headed, was the use of the business metaphor describing all things biological. Biologists would describe the \"cost\" of a certain adaptation, or a \"payoff\" of a certain behavioral strategy, and I thought, well, they've got it all backwards. Rather than biologists using Smith or Galbraith or Friedman as their conceptual modellers in these casual descriptions, economists should be using Darwin to fathom the world of business and finance.Biologists will often talk of a fitness landscape. The idea being that the further up on the landscape you are, the more fit an individual can be considered (given that the terrain is a metaphorical or visual aid for selection pressures). Thus, being up on a plateau is better than being down in a valley. Or supposedly so. It could be that the plateau is not the highest one. The highest one is called the \"global maximum\", others not so high are \"local maxima\". The problem with being on a local maxima, at least within the narrative of the fitness landscape, is that one must descend back down into the valley to ascend a higher peak. Well, this always struck me as a silly metaphor, but only because of the study of nonlinear population models I did in college, and as a computational hobby for years afterwards.In the late 80s I decided that a much better term was fitness seascape, considering that models that best modeled population dynamics, competition, and cooperation, were not only nonlinear (with feedback loops), but also, well, dynamic. In other words, searching for a general solution, a permanent global maximum, was silly because, the accurate model, like Nature itself, had conditions changing over time. An individual sitting on a peak, could through external events, suddenly find itself sitting in a trough. And thus adaptations are always local. Or rather, non-local, but relative, with no absolute frame of reference. No Newtonian world view of static spaces and times.And not just external circumstances. The fitness of the individual to local conditions changed local conditions. There is a self-referential feedback loop similar to Einstein's ideas about mass and gravity and space and time.The classic visualization is the solar system viewed as heavy and light iron balls (mass) on a rubber sheet (space/time). The weight of the balls bends the sheet (gravity). The bends in the sheet changes the position of the balls. The \"success\" or fitness of an individual can change the local conditions of fitness in the same way- although not always as a bend downwards. Relativity being the key phrase here, as, in business as in biology, fitness is a relative positioning, not an absolute one.So, on my own (honest!), I came up with the term fitness or adaptive seascape. Eventually, the world of academia caught up with me. David J Merrell is credited with coining the term, but actually, I did.Back to Stephenson's essay, and what annoyed me. He decries the timidity and short-sightedness of private industry. Agreed. He decries the zero tolerance for risk that firms increasingly retreat to. Agreed. He claims that as a (partial) result, innovation is slowing in pace. Disagreed.A casual glance at the numbers suggests that it is simply not so. True, less world-changing gadgetry is out there, or seems to be. But, in keeping with my ideas about the fallacy of preformationism, the epigenetic narrative, the narrative of history, we simply have not been around long enough to recognize the real consequences of our current crop of gadgets. (Just as it took some time to realize how the telegraph, and by extension speed-of-light communications, fostered the development of the modern corporation).  \"Hi there! I'm Mister B!\"Besides which, if it is true that innovation is slowing down (which I don't think it is), even Stephenson himself recognizes (or so I recall) the remarkable progress of  the Long Boom is owed to some extent by Mister B. Mister B (whom the Japanese called B san) pummeled the majority of the world's industrial landscape into rubble some sixty years ago. The great rebuilding resulted in a one time increase in all things gadget. Couple this with the assumption that the gadgets invented over the past 100 years are all the low-hanging fruit, in other words, the easy stuff to invent, this also may explain the perceived slowdown in innovation.Continuing under this assumption, we have arrived that the temporary gadget plateau. However, if you look at the current crop of innovations, you will note it is less about gadgets and much, much  more about materials and processes. Nanotech. Synthetic biology. Spintronics. Metamaterials. Graphene. Quantum computing. Energy storage membranes. Superatoms. The world of materials engineering is very quickly to enter its golden age - assisted by chemists, biologists, and physicists.Stephenson mourns the world where big stuff could be done. I would suggest that he bemoans a world where the easy stuff could be done. The stuff that looked risky, but actually wasn't.The really truly risky stuff still lies ahead of us."},

At first I waited to see if this was just a flash in the pan, but the Occupy Wall Street movement seems to be gaining momentum.

I would think even the most heartless capitalist stooge should recognize that an idled mind and hands is a waste of both capital and labor. It is a devastating loss of time, talents, and monies - a loss to the individuals, to the community, to business, to country, to the world.Now, you would think the responsible so-called \"job creators\" would be taking notice.

Funny\".Interesting thing about these kids that gravitate towards me here. They are the geek kids. The ones that play chess and role playing games. They are all soft, and a little pale, and soft-spoken, and shy, and funny, and for some reason, a lot are Pagans, or pretend to be, and all of them weird and quirky and interesting. And I encourage them in their weirdness and quirkiness and dorkiness.I think I used to be one of them. Minus the soft part. Don't ask me how I ended up being GySgt Kurman (I don't know, can I call myself that? Well, two former student aides, both Marines who served in Iraq, called me that, so, yeah, I guess it's OK).I guess it was when I realized no one was going to take care of me anymore, adn I had to do shit for myself. And also, I realized I liked working, and collecting skills. It's the only collection I've ever had or done. Skills.They tell me they are scared of me at first, then realize the volume, tone, cadence, and inflections of my manner of speaking isn't shouting, or barking, and I won't cut their head off with a chainsaw if they ask something stupid. And that I have a very, very deadpan sense of humor.They realize I'm there to dispense knowledge, for, oh, I don't know, so that they can carry on just in case I get shot in the head, or something.A guest editorial today from Eldest Brother. He has a complaint about Volvo drivers. I thought they were all hippie moms listening to NPR and such. But then, ah, true, there's the old saying about utopian social engineers:\"Scratch a hippie, find a Nazi\"A quick check of the global pulse suggests he may be on to something. Many hold the opinion that the biggest asshole drivers out there own BMWs, Mercedes Benzs, etc. with Volvos and Saabs up there in the ranks. Could it have something to with Volvos have a very high survival and safety rating? Could it be that shitty drivers are suggested towards these vehicles? Wow, that seems to be the idea when you look at the Urban Dictionary's take on Volvos. \"Hey, look at that guy driving a Volvo. What an asshole!\"My understanding is that Volvo Station Wagons are now discontinued.Hmm. It may have something to do with the fact that Volvo sold only 480 V50 Station Wagons in the US last year. That, and the fact that Volvo was sold by Ford to China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group in 2010. At any rate, here's Eldest Bro's take:\"Perhaps things are different for you in Northern Illinois, but here in Granola County of Northern California, it seems we are infested with self-righteous slow-pokes driving the ubiquitous Volvo wagon. Not the new sleek Ford-inspired ones either, but the traditional old boxy tanks. More often than not, you will find yourself trapped in the left lane behind one of these individuals whose speed is randomly varying between 56 and 62 mph and who is giving you disapproving looks in the rear view. It seems sometimes these people are \"regulators\" whose attitude is, I'm going fast enough, I'm going to keep the rest of you from speeding, so you should either back off or fuck off. My view: Hey, if you 're going to make yourself responsible for my behavior, maybe you'd like to pay my god damn cable bill, or figure out how to deal with my teenager, or actually make yourself useful in some fashion. OK, now I'm done\". Okay, speed vigilantes? And willing to inconvenience others in order to impose their version of reality. Yeah, I'd say that's an asshole. Kind of like Glenn Beck and the Tea Partiers.Fuck those sanctimonious busybodies."},
{"title": "\"1493\" by Charles C. Mann: A Half-Ass Review", "date": "Monday, September 26, 2011", "text": "By happy circumstance, I happened to concurrently read \"Everything is Obvious Once You Know the Answer\" by Duncan J Watt along with \"1493\" by Charles C. Mann. Since I have on my own (honest!) formulated a lot of the same thoughts that Watt presents, I will shamelessly paraphrase him:The difference between prediction and prophecy is the ability to foresee not only what will happen, but also what its meaning will be.\"They\" say that hindsight is 20/20. \"They\", as is usual with the purveyors of conventional wisdom, are full of shit.Not only is the future shrouded in fog, but so is the present and especially the past.In order to understand what is going on, in order to piece together the narrative of history, one has to not only apprehend every single event and circumstance, but also place these in context within future events. Thus, history is like prophecy - if prophecy is, like Aesop's Fables, providing a moral to the story.But the moral can change, not only over time, but by whom is the teller of tale. So, with this in mind...Mann pushes two themes throughout the book, or rather, two flavors of the same theme.The theme is globalization - the flavors the origins and ramifications thereof.Once the Basque ship's captain Legazpi meets up with Chinese junks in the Philippines, to trade Chinese silk and porcelain for Bolivian silver, we are on our way to global trade. Or rather, once Friar de Urdaneta figures out the return trip to Mexico via the Northern Pacific, it's more or less a complete circuit. \"Pangaea stitched together again\", the idea of the one-world supercontinent split asunder and then made whole, perhaps not quite the accurate metaphor geologically or biologically, but prodigious enough.More importantly, the Columbian exchange of every variety of life, changes everything. It causes massive deaths and dieoffs which occur to this very day. It causes (beginning through the export of Old and New World crops and animals, an exponential increase in the numbers of humanity which is only now (perhaps) reaching a plateau.I've often written of the Singularity. This is not a form thereof, more a Black Swan event, but the impact of the Columbian exchange certainly has the biggest characteristic of a Singularity - All Bets Are Off. No one could have any idea, none whatsoever, what the emergent consequences would be. Certainly nothing like it has been seen since the beginnings of Neolithic culture, and the Agricultural Revolution.Mann does a wonderful job in summarizing the impacts, or rather, updating the narrative first put forward by Alfred Crosby in his books \"The Columbian Exchange\", and \"Ecological Imperialism\", to name just two of many, many others Mann uses. (In the acknowledgement at the end of the book, Mann states \"If 1493 brings new readers to these books, I will be more than satisfied\". I, for one, will provide him this satisfaction. He would be hard press to write a more engaging collection of historical goodies to set off the seeking instinct within me. ...I'm sorry, but I have to throw my dog-eared segments in here.The Difference Between Fantasy and Magical RealismPortugal transplanted an entire colony from North Africa to northeastern Brazil:  \"The transition was eased by grants of cash, livestock, and several hundred slaves... within a decade of arrival the colonists - malarial, famished, living in wretched huts they were too poor to repair - were begging the crown to relocate them. Ultimately, almost all of the surviving Europeans slipped away. The remainder soon died. Through no act of their own, the slaves found themselves at liberty... They were free as long as they pretended they weren't. The Portuguese administration wanted to be able to report to the king that his subjects were guarding Brazil's northern flank. The slaves were willing to say they were doing it, if that meant they were left alone. Everyone was happy: the maroons (mixed descendents slaves, Indians, and the few seasoned Europeans) pretended they were Portuguese subjects in a Portuguese colony and the Portuguese pretended the maroons were guarding the border\". A Hollywood Treatment for the Conquistador/Samurai Buddy MovieThe \"hidden\" history of Asians in the New World is worthy of a few good yarns. Somewhere in a dark corner of my mind, this information was once planted from a book I once read. Nevertheless, once it was made known again, I am fascinated with the idea the Hollywood treatment for the following:\"Known collectively as chinos, Asian migrants spread slowly along the silver highway from Acapulco to Mexico City, Puebla, and Veracruz. Indeed, the road was patrolled by them - Japanese samurai perhaps in particular. Katana-swinging Japanese had helped suppress Chinese rebellion in Manila in 1603 and 1609. When Japan closed its borders to foreigners in the 1630s, Japanese expatriates were stranded wherever they were. Scores, perhaps, hundreds, migrated to Mexico. Initially the viceroy had forbidden mestizos, mullatos, negroes, zambaigos, and chinos to carry weapons. The Spaniards amde an exception for the samurai, allowing them to wield their katanas and tantos to protect the silver shipments against the escaped-slaves-turned-highwaymen in the hills.\"The Other Black Gold Mann spends a lot of time in the Amazon with UCLA geographer Susanna Hecht. Hecht contends that \"three fundamental materials were required for the Industrial Revolution. Steel, fossil fuels, and rubber\". While I'd disagree that these are needed to get it all going, I'd certainly agree that they are needed for its fruition into the electrification phase. Without vulcanized rubber, all sorts of items become extremely difficult to build. Insulation for wiring for one. Belts to transmit motion from engines to appliances for another. Tires. Inflatable tires.\"Equally important but less visible, every internal combustion engine contains many pipes and valves that channel, usually under pressure, water, oil, gasoline, and exhaust vapor. Unless the parts are manufactured perfectly, engine vibrations will cause liquids and gases to vent dangerously from joints. Flexible rubber gaskets, washers, O-rings almost invisibly fill the gaps. Without them, every home furnace would be at constant risk of leaking natural gas, heating oil, or coal exhaust - a potential death trap\".Even today, synthetic rubbers made from petroleum feedstocks do not even closely approximate the performance of natural rubbers. And rubber, latex, comes from only one tree - Hevea brasiliensis. More about this in a moment.The Other Other Black GoldMuch has been made by various doofuses about the European expansion during (from a European standpoint) the Age of Exploration (say, 1000-1500CE) being the resuklt of European exceptionalism. There is far too much evidence in this book to suggest the huge amount of pure dumb luck that kept Europe - again and again - out of the Malthusian Trap. Without the potato, and guano, European soils would have been depleted - especially in Northern Europe where the soils and climate are not conducive for large populations. In fact, it is doubtful that (Northern) Europe could ever have escaped the cycle of famine that kept it such a primitive backwater for so long to stride upon the world stage as it did. More importantly, with the introduction of the Old World diseases of malaria and yellow fever, Europeans could never have developed the extractive systems with their own populations as the work force. For this, they needed Africans. There can be no doubt.\"...between 1500 and 1840, the heyday of the slave trade, 11.7 million captive Africans left for the Americas...in that (same) period, perhaps 3.4 million Europeans emigrated. Roughly speaking, for every European who came to the Americas, three Africans made the trip... demographically speaking...American was an extension of Africa rather than Europe until late in the nineteenth century.\"Now, the interesting thing is, for the same reason that Europeans do not colonize tropical Africa, for the longest time, they do not colonize tropical America. Tropical diseases, don't you see. And the only reason Europeans dominate to any degree between the Tropic latitudes, given their small numbers, is because they were tolerated due to favorable trade. Globalization, to a great degree, facilitated both the slave trade, and European conquest.\"One of the most persistent myths aboout the slave trade is also one of the most pernicious: that African's role was wholly that of hapless pawns. Except for the trade's last few decades - and arguably not even then - Africans themselves controlled the supply of slaves\"(The reason expounded in the book is that within African systems, land, property was held solely by the state. The only form of private, revenue-generating property recognized by African law were slaves. Although, the form of slavery in Africa is more akin to indentured servitude, or monetary rather than labor extraction, somewhat similar to serfs in Russia. For example:)\"Napoleon sent his army to seize Egypt. An African Napoleon would have sent his army to seize Egyptians\".  That being said, those who ended up enslaved, from an African standpoint, were criminals and prisoners of war - scofflaws, tax cheats, political exiles, unwanted immigrants, and the like. It is a wonder, in fact, given the number of ex-military POWs sent over, that more white plantation owners weren't slaughtered. In any event, the point is not to rationalize the practice, but to recognize that, quite simply the events in the New World - at least the tropical New World - could never have occurred  without Africans. There's a reason I brought this up. Like the rubber thing, I'll get to it.  I have many other dog-eared passages. I wish I had time to relate them all. But, back to the idea of historical narrative. I'm going to suggest that, as in the definition of prophecy given above, perhaps not enough time ('only' 500 years) has passed to truly understand the ramifications of the Columbian Exchange. I personally think the full ramifications will not be known for another thousand, or perhaps ten thousand, years. The meaning of events then we do not know, but I have my suspicions.Since it seems apparent that the Industrial Revolution would have been prolonged, avoided, detained, or even nonexistent without the Columbian Exchange, it follows that Global Warming is also a consequence. And since many of the various tropical diseases to which Africans are (relatively) immune and Europeans are not (unless they \"seasoned\" - got sick and did not die) are still very much extant within the Western Hemisphere, one wonders who will be living where once things start to heat up.I noted, in a previous essay, the not altogether ambivalent drawing of the Mason-Dixon line with respect to the survival and incubation of the malarial parasite. If we assume the worst climate change, say, something akin to the late Miocene, when even the poles were semi-tropical, how will these Europeans fare?It could be that the 22nd century, and maybe beyond, is an African one."},
{"title": "Travelling Through Spaces From Planet to Planet", "date": "Friday, September 23, 2011", "text": "Sun-Ra and his Arkestra \"We Travel The Spaceways\"Funny thing about memory is how recreational it all is. Things are never as you remember them because you don't store shit like a computer does. (Still another reason why Dickie Dawkin's \"meme\" concept is complete and utter bullshit). As I recall, I made a $1 wager with an acquaintance as to whether antimatter will fall up or down, and this would be determined by results from the Aegis Experiment at CERN. Seems to me I made the bet about six months ago, when in fact, it was only August 11th.I had hoped issues would be decided by now, or by the end of the month of September. It doesn't look like it will happen. Meantime, CERN has found evidence that neutrinos may travel faster than light. Didn't see that one coming. In any case, I started thinking about what if I win that $1 bet? What if antimatter falls up? In other words, what if we discover antigravity? Well, anyone remember the brief cold fusion mania from the early '90s? Fleischman and Pons' experimental setup used a little known metal called palladium (a precious metal similar to platinum) for the electrode. At the time, the price of palladium jumped sharply.So, all the stuff used for antimatter? Multiply the palladium mania by a factor of a trillion.Cyrano is off to the Moon!Well, first of all, how you gonna do it? Space travel with antimatter as your antigravity dealie. Well, something quite similar to what Cyrano de Bergerac did to get to the Moon.  Cyrano collected flasks of dew. When the morning sun's heat evaporated it, he would naturally float up with it straight to the Moon.Alright, maybe a little more scientific-like, but still, flasks filled with antimatter, or better still magnetic vacuum bottles of it, would repel you from the Earth's mass, and up and away you would go!What kind of antimatter? I'd prefer something that could be contained magnetically, so that means it's charged. Also, I would prefer it be dense enough, like a solid, or a supercooled liquid, so that I can have a small enough magnetic bottle or bucket, or can to store it. (Because I've got to assume you need a little bit more mass of antimatter than the stuff you want to lift, so if Cyrano weighs 72 kg, I need at least, say 80 kg to lift him up).What kind of magnetic bottle? Well, one that won't fail would be good. Using Einstein's mass/energy equivalency principle, I figure 1kg of antimatter, combined with 1 kg of matter, produces an an explosion of around 43 megatons. So, a failed bottle containing 80kg of antimatter is, well, oh my!What is this crazy scheme of mine gonna cost? Well, currently various estimates of anitmatter put it at about $64 trillion for one gram of antihydrogen. Which means getting Cyrano to the moon costs $512 quadrillion dollars. I admit, that's a little steep, but then we aren't producing it in the most efficient way.Big Ass Van de Graaff GeneratorSee, what you do, at least the way Fermilab does it is you slam a proton beam into a metal target, or any block of stuff that has a high atomic number (is therefore more dense and has more particles for the protons to slam into. I'm getting ahead of myself. Firwt, make some protons. This is usually done with a Big Ass Van de Graaff generator. The protons produced here are shepherded into a proton synchrotron ring, which accelerates them up to near the speed of light, and then slams them into a metal target.Baby SynchrotronTypically, you will get one antiproton for around 200,000 protons slammed into the target. I bet there's room for improvement. Then gather the antiprotons into another magnetic ring until you get a whole bunch of them. Then, you would typically want to cool them down (since they are \"hot\" as in billions of electron volts hot) into a magnetic bottle called a Penning trap. (You cool them using magnetic fields and lasers and shit. This is way past what Fermilab does or needs to do).So, then, you just collect them in your magnetic bottle until you have enough, and then, off you go to the Moon.(I also forgot the part about landing on the Moon. The antimatter is going to repel itself against the mass of the Moon, so I guess, it just collects in the Lagrange points of the solar system, unless we use it up as a propellent).Hm. Maybe, uh, maybe I need to think this through some more."},

I mean Democrats seem to be having fun when they are stupid, like posting pictures of their weiners, or dressing in tiger pajamas. Republicans, on the other hand, I guess, just insist on being pricks and assholes.Look at the Honor Roll so far:Joe \"you lie!\" Wilson of South Carolina. Rude asshole. Heckles the President during the State of the Union:Randy \"Babykiller\" Neugebauer of Texas: Rude asshole, hypocrite. Calls REp. Bart Stupak a babykiller during passage of the healthcare reform bill.

Rand Paul, who claims that the market has \"no confidence in President Obama or Secretary Geithner\". Rand Paul, who says \"\"I really think we're living in a failed presidency at this point, because everyone who can vote by investing is not investing\". Apparently Paul hasn't noticed that the DOW closed at 6443.27 on 3/6/2009, and as of 11/20/2011 closed at 11,401.01. Yup. No investment has taken place. The Dow is now in negative numbers.Here's my embedded take on him. I believe my little paper puppet is smarter than he is: Whiny Little AssholeAnd now, the latest stupid asshole to join the list: Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana. Summary for Fleming: Stupid Pampered Whiner.Fleming complains that his businesses only provide him with $400,000 to feed his family. The reporter notes that families earning $40,000-50,000 a year may not be sympathetic towards his plight.Here's his stupidity. His rebuttal is:\"Class warfare's never created a job\"What the fuck you talking about dipshit? What the fuck does that have to do with the observation that most people are not going to be sympathetic towards your pissy little moan that your take home pay is only $400,000 a year. (Which is a fucking lie, by the way, he earns more than that). And then to top this all off by simply parroting the current conservative party line is, quite simply, not the best display of intelligence I've seen.This is what a so-called \"job creator\" looks like. Actually, take a picture of his butthole, because working in a Subway, or UPS store, is a shit job.No actually, this may be a learning experience for Dr. Fleming (ah, a doctor, must have flunked biochem and punted) in that people can boycott his stores. Geez. No customers. No business activity. No business. No job creation. Can he figure out the syllogism?Betty Don't."},
{"title": "The Minnesota Starvation Experiment", "date": "Monday, September 19, 2011", "text": "I was going to write about a peculiar parameter in the whole male/female behavioral landscape. I don't really have a term for it. I'm aware of the difference between sex and gender - in other words, what you have down there and what you think you should have down there.This is different. I've noticed, for example, that I am your standard man's man in the sense that I am orthodox hetero, have the equipment of a man, and feel like I should have the equipment of a man, and more importantly, don't really care for shopping.My idea of shopping for a hat is to find a hat on the side of road, notice it fits, that it is in a good state of repair, and can be cleaned up if necessary. I am done shopping for a hat.I know other guys who satisfying the above conditions for being a man's man, will easily go out shopping for two hours for a hat. A fucking baseball cap.This is not the same as being clothes' horse. I like to look sharp. I like to dress up when the occasion calls for it. But I will not engage in this rather feminine gathering behavior of shopping the way I have seen some men do it. This... Male Barbie Syndrome (for lack of a better term, and I am open to suggestions) is a parameter of the human psyche which I think, but am not certain, is a recent and modern phenomenon. I suspect it has a name. I just don't know it.But that's not what I want to talk about. I recently remembered a study done during WWII called the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. A doctor named Ancel Keys brought together a number of conscientious objectors to study starvation in order to determine what it would take to rehabilitate the victims of privation in Europe. The one thing I recall was that the supposedly unique American worldview, the\"can-do\" spirit, the unbridled optimism, the generosity and positive outlook, pretty much disappeared when starvation is imposed.In other words, the whole American can-do spirit is simply a by-product of being well fed.I suspect that, there are in fact, certain nutritional requirements that, if not fulfilled, result in a radical change in behavior.It is my hypothesis that conservatives, and in particular Republicans, and more specifically the Tea Party faction of Republicans act the way they do due to dietary deficiencies.They are lacking in Vitamin N.Which is why they are not Nice."},
{"title": "\"Rick Perry believes being a Texan means being a right-wing blowhard\"", "date": "Friday, September 16, 2011", "text": "I'm actually kind of indifferent to Texas, although, based upon my movie choices, I always figured Texas was extensively populated with Satanists (Race with the Devil), vampires (Near Dark), and cannibals (Texas Chain Saw Massacre). I also always figured Texans as a people whose tongues was deathly afraid of their teeth, based upon the way they talk.That quote in the essay title? So says the Houston Chronicle. They're from Texas, so I suppose they'd know. My personal opinion is, despite being so successful in politics, Perry just comes across to me as an ignorant jackass. Haven't we had more than our fair share of presidents like that? Do we really need another one?Funny thing about Texas, love it or hate it, it is definitely an integral part of American culture.Some positive attributes about Texans: generous, polite, courteous, hospitable, friendly.Some negative attributes about Texans: lazy, violent, uneducated, bigoted,... too numerous to mention, but basically a distillation of all white-trash behaviors, and \"blowhard\" seems to sum it all quite well.So anyway, governors of Texas can name worthy outsiders 'honorary Texans'. If you follow this linked article to Mother Jones, you can see, at the end of article, a lot of people who have been named 'honorary Texans'. The currency of the tradition is that Rick Perry has honored people like Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, and Sarah Palin. Well, blowhards all, so yeah, I guess the Houston Chronicle is on to something.What I don't understand at all is why Pee Wee Herman isn't an honorary Texan.I mean, the guy really did some heavy lifting in promoting Texas in his movie \"Pee Wee's Big Adventure\". I've got to wonder how much the tourism industry bounced for San Antonio after that movie? How many people went looking for the Alamo's basement after that?Pee Wee Herman has been hosted by the Dallas Cowboys. He was treated better than Bush! Pee Wee Herman has been an honorary Muppet. Pee Wee Herman has been an honorary Marine. (Well, I guess that counts for more than an honorary Texan).I think... I think I want a cowboy hat."},

They count on the few times when they are lucky enough to get a hit to move them forwards, and the rest of the time? They rely on the regular guy's really shitty memory. Stockpickers, political pundits, you name it. They set the conventional wisdom for the rest of us, and they are completely full of shit.Take this guy here. Seems a nice enough young lad. He's an \"author, entrepreneur, and former USAF pilot in special operations\". He wrote a book about \"irregular warfare\", and people like G. Gordon Liddy want you to buy it. Wow. So it must be something.In the piece I referenced, he goes on and on about how central planning is bad. According to him, it's what brought down the Soviet Union. Actually, he says the Soviet Union collapsed because of \"misallocation of resources due to a reliance on central planning. More specifically, he states that: \"The reason for this failure was that the Soviets relied on central planning.  A system of economic governance where small group of people -- in the Soviet Unions case bureaucrats -- had all the decision making power.  They decided what was spent and where.  Even with copious amount of information, they decided badly\".Well, this reads like something I would have written in the sixth grade, in that he pretty much ignores what actually happened over in the Soviet Union over the full eighty years of its existence, the several and varied phases it went through, and the last deadly decade of its life.But he is pretty much parroting conventional wisdom, isn't he?  I mean, the Soviet Union collapsed didn't it? It was centrally planned wasn't it? QED. And that is your standard last superpower standing triumphalist message, ain't it? Doesn't matter that Reagan fucked our economy over to topple theirs does it?But is that all there is to this? I mean is the dreaded \"central planning\" a necessary and sufficient condition? Or is it a necessary condition? Corporations, after all, are little teeny tiny centrally planned economies. Does this mean they will inevitably collapse?What about the opposite? Lenin and Stalin managed to turn a backward agrarian nation into a world-dominating superpower? Does \"central planning\" get credit for that?  I wonder about a different scenario. Let's try it out. We'll call it \"wife-swap\", and it goes like this. Leave the political and socio-economic systems the same, but we'll imagine a swap of circumstances for the US and the CCCP. Let's imagine a US after World War II, where everything east of the Appalachians has been bombed into rubble. Let's imagine a US population that comes out of the conflict with 27 million dead. Let's imagine the US facing an aggressive, determined, well-fed, prosperous, hostile, nuclear armed enemy. An enemy whose industrial infrastructure is completely intact, and whose scientific and technological facilities are operating on all cylinders.Now, let's imagine the US gearing up to match this enemy militarily, technologically.Think we could do it? Think we could, for a few brief months in 1972, achieve nuclear parity, in fact, achieve a brief superiority? Think we could maintain a standing army of two million? Have nuclear subs prowling the oceans, satellites orbiting the earth, scientific probes landing on other planets? Think we could do it all without devoting a full 50% of GDP to the military? Think you could do that in a free market atmosphere, with the goal of all those CEOs out there to keep pace with an implacable enemy, and at the same time preventing an erosion of our freedom and liberty.I don't think so.Which tells me, it was really more about an American triumphalist narrative, than it was about what happened behind the Iron Curtain.Experts really should do more research, and spew bullshit a lot less."},

I was going to write about it because it is - at this point in my life - a rare and unusual thing and therefore noteworthy and fodder for humorous depiction.But lately, I've hit upon a funny little piece of synchronicity in the form of two books that are completely unrelated. And yet, I can tell that things are cooking on the back burners of my brain at the moment, which means... these two books, \"1493\", and \"It's Obvious Once You Know The Answer\" have a common thread in the form of counterfactuals. Or at least in my head they do.How so? Well, it's all rather indistinct and half-formed at the moment, but basically, the material in both books constantly make me ask \"what if\" questions about things. What's so special about this person, this event, at this particular time? And, of course, the answers I keep getting from reading is, there's nothing special. There is no pivotal person or event or circumstance. There is instead, always, a peculiar convergence of linkages and attributes within the network of stuff. And to find out anything more would require a many-worlds test to determine the actual reasons for why, say, Chris Rock made it, or why Facebook is popular, or why Spain chose to fund Columbus despite his hare-brained schemes.I could go on and on about my favorite themes of counterfactuals and the epigenetic processes with regards to human society and history, but, I'd like to keep this one short and on target.The successes and failures have less to do with any inherent advantage or attribute that a person or thing has, and more to do with pure dumb luck for the lack of a more scientific term. As my Norse ancestors once said \"'It's better to be lucky than smart\". I'd rather like being lucky and smart, but you can't have everything.Or can you?In any event, this whole idea of counterfactuals, successes, failures, advantages managed to hit me upon reading this Atlantic Monthly article entitled \"The Most Racist Thing that Ever Happened to Me\" by a gentleman named Touré. I'm not familiar with him. I don't think I have an anecdote to contribute either.   What exactly it was that hit me was a quote early on: \"I asked my 105 interviewees, What is the most racist thing that has ever happened to you? The response I received most often was indicative of modern racism: The answer is unknowable. \"I imagine it'd be a thing I don't even know ever happened,\" Aaron McGruder said. \"It would be that opportunity that never manifested and I'll never know that it was even possible.\" A decision is made in a back room or a high-level office, perhaps by someone you'll never see, about whether or not you get a job or a home loan or admission to a school. Or perhaps you'll never be allowed to know that a home in a certain area or a job is available\".The emboldened and italicized text was done by me, and if that sentence is not a candidate for a very special counterfactual, a particularly twisted and malformed orbit in a nonlinear amusement park ride, I'd be hard-pressed to find a better one.Here's the thing (getting back to me, of course), is that, despite me bitching about things, I've got it really fucking good, have fallen ass-backwards into good shit more times than I care to think about, and quite frankly, and pretty damn self-aware as to how much I owe to good people around me.But if anything is crystal clear in the article (my take at any rate), what's made clear (to me) is that in some way those who are making their testimony, those who, having been selected by Touré as noteworthy, have been lucky and smart.Oh, not the kind of luck I'd want to have, that's for fucking sure.I think it is a form of luck, like an antimatter version kind of luck. It's transformational - if you can handle the gamma radiation.The people interviewed have managed to perform a particularly tricky little bit of ju-jitsu on what life handed to them. And I've really to wonder, had things happened that didn't, that they didn't know happened, as happens to us all, just how things might have turned out.And perhaps that's the modern day horror story for us all."},
{"title": "\"1493\" by Charles C. Mann", "date": "Friday, September 9, 2011", "text": "Sorry, there are no dancing skeletons in the book, I just liked the pictureShort essay version: Buy this book.  Longer version: I read Mann's \"1491\" some years ago, and found it entertaining, informative, engaging. Alright, so the middle part was a bit dry, but I managed to make it through without slogging. The gist of the book was that, as a result of recent archaeological discoveries and research, the Western Hemisphere was far more populous, and advanced, than depicted.As a result, the Columbian Holocaust - the die-off of the original population due to disease and maltreatment - was far larger than anyone imagined, with perhaps as high as 30 million people.\"1493\" takes the next logical step as to the ramifications of all this. The emphasis being upon the ecological and biological effects of the Columbian Exchange. Far more than just the movements of people, the more important movements of animals, plants, bacteria, and viruses. The author tries, and often succeeds in looking at the big picture ramifications of clashing ecologies, and also understanding historic and modern events through the prism of biology.(Indeed, I've started to look at the expansion of English culture, first through the British Empire, then the American, as nothing more than the efflorescence of a non-native introduced species, like zebra mussels, or Asian carp).I remember reading Jared Diamond's \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" when it first came out in 1997. It took a somewhat similar bent towards viewing events and circumstances from a geographic standpoint. I remember first agreeing with the general points of the book, and certainly the idea that the European expansion had a great deal more to do with luck and circumstance than innate superiority of the whites. But over time, and after recognizing the lackluster scholarship of the book, I realized that the actual title of the book should have been \"Germs, Germs, and Germs\". That was the real advantage of the European, or more precisely, the Eastern Hemispherean of just being plain filthy and disgusting and having built up immunites to some of the more virulent infestations the human animal is heir to.As such, \"1493\" does a much better explanatory job than \"GGS\". (And, really, if you want better reads - and all of these texts cited in \"1493\" by Mann - try \"The Columbian Exchange\" and \"Ecological Imperialism\" by Alfred Crosby, or \"Plagues and People\" by William Mcneill).At any rate, I'm only about a third of the way through the book, and though a lot of the material should be viewed as conjecture, I still agree with it. I really should do a proper book report on this, but anyway, some highlights that I've dog-eared:The Little Ice Age of 1560-1850 may have been the result of the reforestation of North America. With the end of so many slash-and-burn agricultural societies, from the massive die off of American Indians, a huge amount of carbon dioxide was drawn from the air.Malaria and yellow fever, brought over to the New World by Europeans, may have resulted in the Involuntary African Diaspora. In the author's own words: \"malaria did not cause slavery. Rather it strengthened the economic case for it\". Further \"Biology enters history when one realizes that almost all the slaves ferried to the Americas came from West and Central Africa...(with an inherited immunity to malaria - me)...biologically speaking, they were fitter, which is another way of saying that in these places they were - loaded words! - genetically superior\".  More malaria popcorn: The general cold temperature demarcation line for the survival of the malaria parasite happens to be the Mason-Dixon line. Northern Union forces lost more men to sickness than battle, and the Civil War was drastically prolonged as a result. Given the overwhelming superiority of the Union forces over the wretched, weak, puny Confederacy, the war should have last no longer than a few months. There thus is the possibility that malaria is partly responsible for the Emancipation Proclamation. Likewise, during the Revolution, British forces in the south suffered a similar defeat by the mosquito.The success of English colonization (a pretty fucking horrid story of corporate indifference, where 9 colonists died for every 1 successful settler), aside from the Chinese Wave method of colonizing (ship more people over until living outnumber the dead) was due to the drug trade. One of the most addictive and brain-bendingly powerful drugs ever cultivated: tobacco. (Aside form me, kind of gives you a clue into space colonies, huh? Here was a biologically compatible environment, with suitable food supply, ready resources to hand, and the colonists still died like flies. Wonder how a Mars colony would fare? Well, I mean, even not under the British.)That's enough for now. I'll write more as I read through."},

The entire field of candidates looked a lot like the monolith scene early in the movie 2001. In fact, someone ought to just hand Rick Perry the thighbone of a tapir right now and solidify his 2012 Presidential Image.   It was hard to top any or all of those capering simian antics, but I think special mention has to go out to Crazy Grandpa Ron Paul. (Actually, special mention should also go out to the recent Kentucky appearances of his son, Rand Paul, for Best Imitation of an Egg-Eating Snake due to the amazing unlatching of his jawbone in order to suck on the giant cocks of the coal industry. Well done, Rand, and there are plenty of polluters tired of federal regulations that will line up for your special talents as Senatorial Fellator Extraordinaire far, far into the future. You are a credit to cocksuckers everywhere).Anyway back to Crazy Grandpa. At one point, he mentioned how he can buy a gallon of gasoline with one thin dime! He sounds crazy doesn't he, especially when he gets that wanna-fuck-me-a-goat glint in his eye, or maybe its wanna-sacrifice-me-a-goat-and-then-maybe-do-a-rain-dance glint, but in any case, the fact is, he's right! Of course, it has to be a very special dime, a dime made mostly of silver, such as a pre-1965 silver Roosevelt dime, back when it was 90% silver. More accurately the period 1946-1964, which is where Ron Paul spends some of his time. (The rest of his time is spent sometime back in the mid or late 19th century when the biggest economic debate in Congress was whether to use gold or silver).A quick spot-check suggests the melt-value of one of those shiny  shiny thin dimes is around $3.06. Okay, so not buying a full gallon what with taxes. And then, if we are to believe the Milken Institute via John Huntsman - and why not? - what with military deployments, keeping the sea lanes open, refining, storage, distribution, etc., the price is close to $13 a gallon. So, maybe five dimes to buy a gallon of gas. (I'm excluding the environmental costs, as those are, in a kind-of-socialist-but-we-ain't-gonna-call-it-that way, spread out amongst all of us in a share-the-wealth communal toxic poop disposal system).(And one should also point out to the Northern Wendigo Lady, Michelle Bachmann, that the US of A is currently experiencing an OIL GLUT due to the flood of oil out of the Canadian tar sands and the fields up in North Dakota, but there aren't enough refineries to handle it and create gasoline, which would thus lower the price, and which NO AMOUNT of extra offshore drilling or any of that other ignorant stupid shit she's been spouting we'll make a half a mouse turd's worth of difference in the price. God DAMN it.)Anyway, let's get back to that undiscovered mountain of gold I'd like to see appear. Old crazy grandpa, in all of his talk of going back to the gold standard, fails to realize the whole fucking point of getting off the gold standard to begin with.Fiat currency, aka, paper money. It's greatest strength, and greatest weakness is that determining how much to print determines it's worth. True, you can overprint. Best example? Paper money first started to be used in Song Dynasty China. Then the Mongols invaded, and set up the Yuan Dynasty. Not exactly the most sophisticated thinkers, the Mongols noticed that, hey, people will trade us shit for these little pieces of printed paper... let's print a whole shitload of them and buy stuff! Result? The first recorded instance of hyperinflation.   Cowry shells. Commodity currency. Way back when, lots of nations from the Red Sea to the China used them as an item of exchange, as money. It's not as dumb as it sounds. Sea shells, unlike metal coins, are hard to counterfeit. Then, all of a sudden, the Europeans appeared, and shipped in vast amounts of cowry shells they discovered in the Maldives. A financial system that had been around for centuries suddenly and permanently collapsed.Gold. The problem with money based on gold, or silver, is that the price fluctuates. As a result, unlike fiat currency, you have no control over the external pressures. Go on the gold standard, that golden thaler you carry about is worth a dollar this hour, 85 cents in the afternoon, 1.75 next morning. As long as there is not enough of it, price goes up. Find too much...Other big problems: counterfeiting, dilution (by adding base metals to your coin), hoarding, dumping, all sorts of problems that fiat currency - despite having its own problems - did away with forever.Unless you are the current crop of conservatives, who not only want to stop time, but get in the time machine and go back to a simpler time, when things were good and pure and clean and... people were four feet tall and lived to the ripe old age of 28.

Just this one time, I'll note that I have a rather important new follower of my blog who just happens to be Eldest Brother.I've three brothers (no sisters), with me being the Second Born, or, if you will, with no wise-cracks please, #2 Son. The order is as follows: Eldest Brother is the Smart One. Youngest Brother is the Funny One. Third Born Brother is the Loving One. And I? Obviously, I'm the Beautiful One!  Welcome \"Bro\"! I guess I'll really have to bump up the fucking quality of my entries now!(The scare-quotes around Bro, I'll explain that in a sec'. Oh hell, I'll do it now. I had a rather greasy and scabrous wannabe-hippie roommate in college who called everyone \"bro\". This term currently being the edge of urban hepness amongst the local tribe of little white boys he was from, and reflecting the continual adoption of the ways of the black urban youth... This suddenly reminds of a time when, with the idiot at some party event, we struck up a conversation with some black kids our age. My fool of a roommate attempted to find common ground with them by speaking in an affected cadence and enunciation which might be termed ghetto-speak. I was soundly and deeply embarrassed both for him and myself, as it came out of him sounding rather more like Stepin Fetchit than hepcat. And the black fellers we was talking to exhibited a defensive posture until they realized he was just, you know, a jackass. It was a learning moment for me in just being yourself).Anyway, back to quality essay writing, right now, there is a little fucking fly bugging the shit out of me and you will excuse me while I shoo it out of my office.Today I go to the library today to pick up the reserved book 1493. I'll set aside all the other books I'm reading for this one. I read 1491 some three(?) years ago, and found it sufficiently engaging. My guess is 1493, on the Columbian exchange of all things biological will not disappoint.I also checked out the library for a copy \"Everything is Obvious: *Once You Know the Answer\" by the sociologist Duncan J Watts. I would note that the current sound bite coming out of the Republican camp involves some variation of invoking \"common sense\" They do so knowing full well that such a simplistic phrase is easily digestible to the squid-headed and flipper-limbed out there. That any intelligent take on this dangerously stupid rationalization would require more than just a sentence to inform people that \"common sense\" \"is in reality a series of complex social rules, a priori assumptions, and inaccurate instinctive responses\" . It is also almost always wrong.But that won't stop people aiming for the lowest common denominator of voters: those ignorami known as \"independents\". One wonders, in fact, how any common or recent ancestor of this stripe of conservative has managed to avoid extinction, given that their \"common sense\" ways should have resulted in them choking on their own (or perhaps other's) feces through the simple act of wiping their own ass.In any case, I was thinking about the sequel (if any) to Blade Runner, and through association Ridley Scott's Prometheus a prequel to the Alien series. (I am ignoring the wretched Alien vs. Predator divergences). Now, Ridley is an first-rate entertainer, and so his mission is to do what he needs to do to entertain. In the case of Alien, and presumably Prometheus, to scare the pants off you.His mission in Blade Runner? To overwhelm with awesomeness, I think. But, given that he fleshed out the world created by the screenwriters Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, and only extremely loosely based upon DADOES, I've got to wonder what kind of world they plan on building for the future?  One possible movie clue involves the professions of the replicants in Blade Runner. Roy Batty, combat model for off-world military service. Clearly, command and control. Leon Kowlaski, not quite as bright as Roy, a 180kg/400lb nuclear head loader. Again, military. Pris. Basic pleasure model, but, in the film, not without deadly assassin skills. Zhora. Kick murder squad.  \"Talk about Beauty and the Beast. She's both.\"Question: Who are they fighting?Who are they fighting that requires Leon to load nuclear warheads the way old sail and steam crowd loaded powder and shot? What kind of conflict involves such a... surfeit of nuclear destruction? It sounds like they are glassing a lot of planetary surfaces.It's all off-world, so... Aliens? No, I don't think so.Rebellious colonies? No. Why advertise attractive off-world living then?My bet is corporations are fighting each out there for real estate. Which kind of takes us into the realm of the old British and Dutch East India Companies. Trade wars, but in outer space.That scenario has possibilities. I think that's my extrapolation exercise for the day."},
{"title": "The Elementarium Mytabeenium", "date": "Thursday, September 1, 2011", "text": "It turns out it is fairly easy to discover an element that already exists, and give it a name that will never be used. Given the number of brief, freakish observations and dodgy or slipshod chemical (or alchymical) procedures, its a wonder that some alternate or parallel periodic table of elements does not contain hundreds or even thousands of could-be or might-have-been element names - the mytabeeniums.Take coronium. First sighted in the sun's magnificent coronal prominence during a solar eclipse in 1869, it later turned out to be the element of iron heated to a million degrees. Nebulium, also sighted during an eclipse, was a super-energized form of oxygen.There is even the psychic element occultum, discovered through clairvoyant means by the theosophist Charles Leadbetter. It is documented in the book Occult Chemistry, where it exists in literary form only to this day.  Columbium later turned out to be either tantalum or niobium. One can forgive the error, as the isolation of either element is a matter of great frustration. This probably accounts for their very names. Tantalus was condemned by Zeus to stand under a tree whose fruits were always just out of reach. His daughter, Niobe, is the goddess of tears.The rare earths - not particularly rare - are particularly hard to separate from each other. Not surprising then that they've been confused one with the other, or their compounds confused as elements, or the element confused as a compound. The element of vanadium has been, by the mineralogist Andres Manuel del Rio, named panchromium, and then later, from the heated red salts, erythronium.  Tungsten flirted with being called wolfram, after the ore it is extracted from: wolframite.A whole host of mytabeeniums come from the Swedish village of Ytterby: Lutecia, Neoytterbia, Cassiopium.And then there is the element helium, which, for the longest time was considered just a fantasy. The spectral lines of helium were observed in the sun's light (Greek helios: the sun) in 1868 by the French astronomer Pierre Janssen, and a few months later by the British astronomer Norman Lockyear. With no hard evidence to justify their claims, scientists mocked them for years, poking fun at any fantastic notion with the exclamation \"That's helium!\"The Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay vindicated them in 1895, producing a sample of helum gas from the radioactive decay of a uranium mineral. (Alpha particles, one product of radioactive decay, are helium nuclei).One wonders what strange alternate worlds would exist where such elements are present. Perhaps some Victorian delusion of a world, some parts still trapped in the long 19th century, with others flung into the 31st. Best not to think of it, the mytabeeniums, let loose, would foment nothing less than a far too radical refashioning of reality.The egg of Chaos cracked open.Space and time a roiling mass of undifferentiated tissue.Entropy reset to zero.I've been through one birth of a universe.Once was quite sufficient."},

A combination of complaints from existing students, and me scraping up the remainder of enrollment from recruits through my mailing list gave me a full enrollment in the class - and only a week delayed. Which means my income level for the semester went from poverty to working poor. Yay!I'm currently doing very important things in my primary position as studio technician, such as building up missing items from our inventory. Who the heck steals caulk guns, box-cutter knives, and spatulas? We usually lose a set of drill bits, or something similar, but... caulking guns? Weird. Reminds me of the time I bought a meat thermometer for my Bronze Casting class that I used to check the wax pot temperature. It disappeared after two weeks. Who wants a meat thermometer covered in Victory Brown wax?I am still going through my dry spell of coming up with new work. I think part of it is I am reluctant to make new work as nothing is selling. It's not just me. All the artists I've talked to are having a tough time moving anything. That's not the only reason for the dry spell, but a general discouragement is not conducive to the creative process.I am nearing my two-year quit smoking anniversary. I seem to getting younger. I saw a picture of myself taken about maybe five years ago, and I looked ten years older than I do now. They are not kidding about how breathing smoke into your lungs will damage your skin. On the minus side, I almost immediately started to develop a belly, and added a good twenty-five pounds of weight. The good thing is, trips to the fitness center at the college, and different total body training regimen taken up this past summer, and (what? the guy who could eat anything?) dieting, have allowed me to go from a pudge-boy 225 pounds to a much more hard-bodied 200 lbs. Oh, there's still some room for improvement, but damn, I look good.I probably should leave it on that note, that, oh, yes, I do look good. Feeling pretty good, too.Oh, I almost forgot. Rumor has it (thus the title above) that a sequel to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is in the works. Given that the original movie took place in 2019 (and as per usual futurists vastly overestimate human progress) and we are not even close to either replicants or star travel, one wonders how they would go about it. Also, my Gaddafi-On-A-Stick curios are moving well. They're great for peering around corners, or just fooling around muppeting him. I'm considering a whole tin-pot dictators on a stick series."},

A rugged individualist, he espouses the rugged libertarian ideal that only individuals are worth trusting, but that groups of individuals bound together (like governments, but, I guess, not corporations) are wholly untrustworthy.A \"self-made billionaire\", he chooses to ignore the fact that the most important coin-flip moments in his life were made for him - like the fact that he grew up in a socially tolerant (he's gay), median-household-income-of-$100,000 (he's never been on welfare), culturally vibrant and stimulating (he was never deprived of information) city such as Foster City, California. Peter Thiel also thinks our educational system here in the US sucks, and never mind that he attended a sub-par diploma mill like Stanford University. Never mind that his companies such as PayPal and Facebook were built upon the heavily federally subsidized backbone of the telecommunications and computer industries, or that it just happens to use a government handout called the Internet. It really is a wonder that he became the Ubermensch he is today, despite all the obstacles thrown in his path, all of his stifling experiences, and unfortunate origins.So, like any good megalomaniac rationally self-interested intelligent free market agent, he has decided to run away Go Galt  pioneer a Brave New Waterworld in hopes of ridding the Earth of the moochers and looters, the parasite classes, once and for all, like any good James Bond villain would.

Plus, we've found out that there's more than just the five Aristotelian senses to get data in and out of the human brain.  For example, SQUIDS (sensitive magnetometers) would just get better and better at reading the electrical impulses of the human brain, and a version of TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) would just get better and better at manipulating neuronal signals to transmit data into the brain. Throw in the promise of the wireless revolution, and you end up not being plugged into anything. (So forgive the \"plugged in\" title above, but then again, why is a magazine devoted to futuristic devices called \"Wired\"?)So, I figured on some kind of a propellerhead beanie would be the way to go. Plus, then we find out that all sorts of formerly brain or organ centric sensor cells are spread throughout the human body. Thus tastebud cells can be found in the lungs and the small intestine, and light sensitive cells are strewn about, not just in the eyes, but pretty much everywhere! Let's face it, the natural electronics embedded within the human body is far more sophisticated, adaptable, and quite frankly, unexplored (think of the huge relatively untapped promise of biofeedback) than that of the currently crude electronics of private industry. (Yes, yes, I know about shit like quantum dots and nanotech, the fact is we have not even begun to discover just exactly what our bodies are capable of).I suspect the skin would be a vast interface, and so, again, my smart money was to wait - the same way you wait on every other piece of sophisticated technology jumping its way up the S-curves cascade series.Hey, there's another problem with implanted electronics, whether plugs or tattoos or what have - upgrades. That's annoying! Did I say a tattoo? Better just give me a patch.And, so, that's what the  code-kiddies and future geeks are working on. I like it. More, please."},
{"title": "Upsidaisium - not to be confused with Cavorite", "date": "Thursday, August 11, 2011", "text": "Cavorite, as described in HG Wells' First Men In The Moon, was an alloy that shielded materials from gravity. It was thus a metamaterial that acted as a gravity cloak, just as we are currently working on invisibility cloaks to hide objects or events, and magnetic cloaks to create an antimagnet.Upsidaisium, on the other hand, was a gravity repellent. It consisted of a material (a transmaterial? a material that changes both itself and the surrounding environment?) that was a gravity repulsor, or rather, was a repulsor to normal matter. It fell up.Is there such a thing? Possibly. Scientists at CERN and other places are trying to determine if antimatter has positive or negative mass. We've never produced enough, or kept enough of it around long enough, to know. But that has now changed. Scientists have been able to keep the stuff in magnetic bottles for up to fifteen minutes. Considering the storage time used to be only a few thousandths of a seconds as recently as last year, that's a considerable accomplishment. And now, an experiment at CERN called AEGIS may soon give us an answer as to whether antihydrogen falls up or down - possibly by October of 2011.The Dirac equation (derived by Paul Dirac) has a solution that predicts antiparticles. It actually has four solutions, and two of them are for particles with negative energy, and thus negative mass. If it turns out that antiparticles do have negative mass, and are thus repulsive to regular matter, then this could be a very big thing.First of all, it could mean that dark matter - that matter that cannot be seen but is felt gravitationally, in the faster rotation of galaxies - may not actually be there. Dark matter may be an illusion caused by the quantum vacuum. CERN physicist Slavkov Hajdukovic, a dark matter skeptic, has proposed a theory whereby virtual particles (that can briefly pop out of the vacuum, and then merge and annihilate themselves back into nothingness) are gravitational dipoles (a normal particle of mass and an antiparticle of negative mass), then the gravitational field generated will be stronger than predicted, and thus look like a dark matter particle - not seen but felt. It would certainly simplify things. All other things being equally messy, the principle of parsimony is rather preferred.Ah, but it goes further than that. One of the more exotic speculations in physics is the creation of wormholes, funny spacelike paths that can link different regions of the universe without crossing through. One possible way to create a stable wormhole is with the use of a strange material that has negative mass. A ring of such a material could keep a wormhole mouth from collapsing. Of course, this is all rank speculation, but it could be something to keep an eye on.Because, if you can create a wormhole, you can violate causality. And global causality violation is the new cupcakes.Better start saving up your antiprotons now, fellow babies."},

{"title": "Shameful Moments", "date": "Tuesday, August 9, 2011", "text": "Guilt is an overrated emotion. It is temporary. Shame, however, stays with you forever.Both are complex emotional states, consisting of an elementary, primal emotional component, as well as a higher cognitive component. In the case of guilt, this cognitive component consists of a form of social responsibility. Guilt is a present state condition. As such, it is fairly easy to dismiss or ignore or rationalize away.Shame, on the other hand, is guilt plus memory, or guilt squared, guilt revisited, recreated, relived, and each time the unpleasant experience is as fresh as the first time. Not like grieving, which, though it never goes away, at least gets moderated and diluted some. The experience of shame is the same every time. There's no scar tissue built up to block the pain.I experienced a shameful moment. I was in, I think, 3rd or 4th grade. There was a boy in our school, and I'll call him Troy Clevick. (This was not his real name. I call him that to hide from my own shameful behavior).Troy had what today would be called developmental problems. He was partly deaf, with a lisping speech impediment, was mentally slow, painfully awkward and clumsy, and had a large oafish appearance with round jug head with big chimp ears. As such, Troy received a fair amount of teasing at school, but, given this was small tight-knit community, the teasing was never bullying nor excessively cruel. When it was time to play, Troy played with the group. No one was outcast in our grade school.So, then, one summer, I got a telephone call from Troy. Because of his speech impediment, it was difficult to even know who was calling, or what he had to say. Eventually, after several \"What?\"s from my end, and a repetition of his garbled message, I figured out it was Troy, and Troy was inviting me to his birthday party. And here is the shameful moment, which even today causes blood to rush to my cheeks and my eyes to sting. Troy, after struggling to convey his wishes received the following treatment from me:\"NO!\" (click)Eventually, my mom asked me who it was. I replied it was Troy, that he wanted me to go to his birthday party, and that I had said no. Her reply was, \"You are going to his birthday party. You will call him right back and tell him you are going to his birthday party\". And with that, she dialed the number and put me on the phone.  I got his mother, Lucy Clevick. With my mom standing over, glaring, I told Mrs. Clevick I would like to come to Troy's birthday party. It was the coming Saturday. Selfish little asshole that I was, I dreaded the moment. We went to the Triangle Toy Store and bought Troy a present.Surprisingly, my memories of the birthday party were that it was a very pleasant time. The weather was cool and dry for August. Troy's family lived in a nice country house at the edge of Spectacle Lake. Not on the water, but close to hand. Mrs. Clevick was an especially gracious and attractive woman. The ice cream and cake was spectacular. The games a load of fun. To my surprise, every other child in my class was at the party.Stupid little asshole that I was, I did not know about the mom network in our school system in our little community. I was not aware that, like some close-knit hunter/gatherer tribe, there were no outcasts within it, regardless of differences.Thinking back now, I looking at, well, not only my shamefully cruel behavior, but now, possessed of a thoughtful empathy, the struggles that Troy and his mother and family went through. They fought hard to keep Troy from being abandoned in some institution, struggled valiantly to keep him involved with the other children of his community. And the other people (the parents sure, but mostly the moms and grandmoms) in my community did what they could to keep him involved in it as well.I relive this shameful moment. I do not try to avoid it. It reminds what it means to be part of a group, part of a community. Not just a collection of individuals, of selfish assholes pursuing their own little selfish asshole lives, but of a greater whole with a larger purpose. With numbers comes strength, but also dignity.     My conduct then fucking breaks my heart. But I need to do that every now and then to remain human."},
{"title": "President Hubert Horatio Humphrey", "date": "Wednesday, August 3, 2011", "text": "Once AGAIN, I find myself ensconced in the Best of All Possible Worlds (BOAPW) Convergence, seated upon a bar stool in air-conditioned splendor, in a wondrously ergonomic and aesthetically pleasing building on a heart-achingly beautiful world circling a fantastic star some 450 million light years distance from the planet Earth, here in glorious midsummer of the year 2011CE...As I work my way through the History of Beer (first with a wonderfully fruity ale, then on to a crisp and clean lager, finally a scientifically mellow pilsner), I jot down a few notes. My reverie takes on a minor tone coloration as I consider of some of the more tragic Divergences.  Oh, not catastrophically tragic ones, the WWIII Divergences, under the likes of a JFK, RFK, Reagan, or Clinton presidencies*. No, I'm talking the tragic ones that are all the more tragic due to the waste of opportunity and the fact that they came so close to the convergence. Those are truly tragic. The ones that almost just made it. The ones that mange to avoid the Lost Decades Divergence of 1970-2019, due to the increasingly conservative politics culminating in the disastrous Rise of the Libertarians.One such Divergence is the HHH Presidency. The chances of it happening are absurdly small, even by cosmic standards. It would have required for Hubert Humphrey to stop walking that tightrope he was on with regards to the Vietnam War, and between his loyalties to President Lyndon Johnson, and his own conscience. It was never a question of political courage. Hubert had enough of that. It was, as always, a question of expediency. All politicians know that. As we all know, in 1968 Humphrey lost to Nixon by less than 1% of the popular vote. All it would have taken for a Humphrey Presidency were two things:1) A leak to the press that Nixon aides had persuaded (read bribed) South Vietnamese dictator  Thieu from withdrawing from the peace talks with North Vietnam, and 2) A speech by Humphrey on March 31, 1968 declaring his (known) opposition to the Vietnam War.Had these events occurred, Humphrey would have been elected President. Many things immediately fall into place for the better. The Great Society programs initiated under Johnson continue. Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance begins a drawdown of US troops from Vietnam. Secretary of State Clark Clifford successfully negotiates a peace accord, and by September of 1970 the Treaty of Paris is signed - ending the US involvement in the conflict of Southeast Asia.  With the immense drain of the war taken off of government revenues, Humphrey devotes larger disbursements to the social programs he favored as a senator. Education, nutrition and equal rights being paramount. The Space program gets additional funds for a permanent orbiting station, dubbed Skylab. By 1998, Skylab is an International Space Station, consisting of nearly 2,000 modules in a large simulated gravity wheel, housing nearly 500 astronauts, men and women from all nations. Literacy rates are up. Poverty rates are down. Humphrey was aided considerably by two rather unlikely allies in the Senate, George McGovern, and Bob Dole. Both farm state Senators, they pushed government food programs which greatly aided the agricultural sector.  Humphrey devotes massive funds towards the sciences and engineering, and alternative energy sources such as solar power and nuclear. He is elected to a second term in 1972 with McGovern as his running mate.  They handily defeat the Republican candidate - Ronald Reagan. Nixon astutely runs, and wins, a seat as Senator from California. Nixon will remain as Senator until his death in 2002, is lauded as an accomplished statesman.Few Americans care about the fall of the government of South Vietnam in 1973. Humphrey's overtures at \"detente\" towards the Soviet Union resulted in a series of arms control agreements, and a substantial trade package of American wheat and corn being sent to the Soviet Union. Farmers were happy. The stock market continued the Long Boom.In 1974, relations with China were opened up. Humphrey became the first American president to visit Red China.  With the huge government disbursements into basic scientific research, not to mention a very large portion of minorities entering the academic and work force through federal scholarships and educational programs, a rapid development of computer, communications, and energy technologies, cell phones, personal computers, the Genienet, and the electric car and public transportation sent the economy into overdrive. Also in 1974, the Arab Oil Embargo caused the American public to demand ever more government subsidies and research into alternative energy suppplies. Fortunately, the existing programs were well established. I could go on but its all just too sad. The era of scientific progress and prosperity that occurs through the remainder of the 20th century is blindingly stellar in its accomplishments.But it just was never in the cards.*If you really are one of those gruesome, grisly corpse-licking types that likes to linger over the WWIII Divergences, that information is available in the Library."},
{"title": "What's Wrong With This Picture?", "date": "Tuesday, August 2, 2011", "text": "Working my way through an article in the Scientific American on \"The Evolution Of Grandparents\", and kept coming back to the article's illustration. It's not a particularly engaging or ensorcelling illustration. Doesn't really catch and hold the eye in either subject matter or  execution, but I kept going back to it. What's the fascination here?  Ah. I  figured it out.  This is supposed to show a grandkid and grandpa circa, what 30,000-20,000 BCE? What's wrong with this picture?White Cro-MagnonsDid this blonde have more fun?White people did not exist back then. At least, according to other science articles I've been reading. Not that big of a deal? No, probably not. People will depict things in a way that is familiar to them. It is no more surprising to see depictions of white Cro-Magnons than it is to see pictures of blonde-haired blue-eyed Jesus. Or Daryl Hannah Raquel Welch as a cavewoman. But what's a little historical revisionism in the name of art? Eh?We now have an early date for silicone implantsRecast with Halle BerryFact of the matter is, from the articles available, there's a pretty good chance that my Cro-Magnon ancestors were a lot more dark complected than they are depicted in popular literature. In fact, the DNA evidence suggests that all the polygenic traits that resulted in a lighter complected European peoples only goes back 12,000 - 6000 years ago. The supposition is that this tendency towards a light complexion was due to dietary changes. Once you adopt an agrarian diet, you lose a source for vitamin D from meat, and so not surprisingly, supplementing vitamin D via UV absorption at higher latitudes presents a problem if melanin blocks this mechanism. Small wonder that you see a gradation via higher latitudes in those who are not hunter/gatherers.Are they black or white? Who fucking cares?There can be no question that all of the genes - regardless if they be for hair, skin, or eye colors - are all African in origin. Big fucking deal. What's the problem here? Why do racists get all bent out of shape on these issues? I, for one, chalk it quite simply to a lack of imagination.  They're just stupid fuckers. Doesn't really matter how well they do in life, or what their  IQ is gauged at, they're still just stupid fuckers.Most of them (them being primarily dumbass white supremacists) don't even realize that there isn't just one gene for being white or yellow or black, or what have you. There is no gene for blue eyes. There is no gene for blonde hair.There is a mutation, a series of mutations, that result in a series of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the protein coding portion of the OCA2 gene. These SNPs functionally determine how \"on\" or \"off\" the protein coding portion will be, which in turn determines how much melanin is produced in the iris. Thus, you end up with a startling range of colors, from a disturbingly doll-like black, to my rather dull-looking blue/green/grey irises to  the  creepy ice blue Morlock  irises that some people have.One thing for certain, anyone with blue eyes has one common ancestor from which the mutation spread. I guess you could say we blue-eyed types are some seriously fucking inbred hillbillies.Similarly for  hair color, but in this case the functional  segment can code for  two types of melanin:  eumelanin for the brunette to blonde range, and pheomelanin - a red-brown polymer - for the redheads. Likewise for skin color. In fact, Asians have developed a completely different mutation for light complexion than Europeans.Well, these red eyes are sexyGiven that sexual selection is probably a very strong driver for these divergences, I wonder if people with an iris color using pheomelanin ever occurred, or can occur? Well, it has been said that if blood red eyes were considered sexy, red-eyed people would be around. On second thought, if you are an albino, n-n-n-no.This is not to say there are not genetic differences more than skin deep. There are. Africans, in general, have a greater bone and muscle density than non-Africans. Northern Europeans, in general, have larger eyes and a larger visual cortex than others. (Live in fog most the  time, and see how you do).So what? Bottom line, no real test  of live action cleverness, no really good test that looks for innovation, brilliant improvisation, shows that any supposed ethnic group - taken as a category - does even marginally better than chimps.(And categories are rather useless. Why, take my own family history. My maternal grandfather was what they call a \"black Norwegian\". His whole side of the family looked like they were from Sicily, with black hair, black eyes, and olive skin. Their (and my) cousins, on the other hand, looked like they would glow in the dark. And all of them from a region the size of two or three counties.)By Mother Earth's standards of IQ survival tests, I'd say 99% of us are going to do very, very, very poorly dumped naked on the savanna.It's all just silliness, isn't it?This summary is not available.

{"title": "Listing To Starboard: Some Predictions", "date": "Monday, August 1, 2011", "text": "It is a sad state of affairs indeed when the perfect presidential candidate for the Republican field is: Barack Obama.Sad indeed, but true. The big shift right continues in this country. A moderately conservative centrist like Obama (there has never any question that he was) is now considered a highly dangerous communist socialist liberal commie crypto-muslim cooperator.As I have said before, we as a nation, have never, ever even remotely been in danger of living under a left-wing dictatorship. A right-wing one, however, is always a possibility. I've reminded those few clear-thinking, or at least non-rigidly thinking, intelligent conservative types that they have a major policing operation on their hands, to keep the nihilistically zealous fanatics from holding the nation hostage. Sadly, it is too late.Given the most recent farrago of resentments and fist-snaking from the Teatard Taliban, and , ugh, the fact that the repulsive Mitch Mcconnell is holding thumbs-up with a predatory grin on his pink little turtle face can mean only one thing: those of us with real jobs are truly going to fucked up the ass in a new and innovative manner. Oh, not like the old straightforward in-and-out.   We the American people are in for some fancy style ass-fuckings. And it is not a matter of sitting still for it. The Republicans have developed moving-target interactive ass-fucking technologies, with sideways dodging anti-butthole-jinking software, vigorous-circular-motion precision blasting,and fist-felchingly, awesomely thorough depth gauging. Oh, American public, you are in for a treat!Like, as Thomas Jefferson purportedly said \"People get the government they deserve\". Of course, Ol' TJ also said \"a little rebellion now and then is a good thing\", but he said that from the safety of his palatial slave estate, so you can't take someone who sat out the Revolution deflowering mademoiselles in a Paris apartment too seriously, now can you? But anyway, gotta find humor in all of this, right? Right?Well, here's a little strategyzing, to see how it all plays out. Ready?The forty year drift to the right, with its concomitant demolishing of pretty much any social assistance programs, has still not engendered the wrath of the people. Despite the fact that any slouching towards a libertarian free-market paradise has had zero empirical reassurances as to its efficacy (and so libertarians doggedly rely upon reasoning from first principles to back up their fucked-in-the-head economic policies), the American people just keep slogging into the shit storm, heads down, lips tightly pressed closed, hoping that, jsut perhaps that dark horizon ahead is a sign that the sideways streams of poo will lessen the further we head into it.Oh, its' easy to find all the bad news about income inequality and how rich fuckers have prospered on the backs of the middle and working classes.But the one indicator that even the rich parasitic layabouts should care about says that they have fucked themselves as well!!Their money, which makes more money than they do, could have made more money! Real GDP per capita growth rates, basically flat since 1980, when we were told it is now \"morning in America\", have, since the advent of 2000 and the reign of Bush The Lesser, tanked severely downwards. Which means even the filthy rich, busy paying their minions to fuck the rest of us, have, through their own greed and shortsightedness, have actually short-changed themselves.Oh, the irony.So, and now we have a resolution of this fake budget crisis with a \"budget deal\" (which means nothing really, as government inaction will result in the repeal of the Bush tax cuts next year, and then the revenue problem starts to alleviate the deficit to manageable self-sustaining levels), which results in cutbacks in federal spending. It is almost certain that, with the loss of spending from the public sector, this will result in a halt to an already dismal GDP growth, and a continuation of our wonderful in-all-but-name economic depression.Basically, the Republican party has scored a Pyrrhic Victory. They have wasted all of their oxygen and energy on a fake debt crisis in pursuit of their ideological vision of reduced government. They have completely disengaged on every other single conservative issue. Having blown their wad and gone limp on the fake budget crisis, the old boys are done, wiped out, zonked on the mattress with dribble on their chins. Not an attractive sight.My own highly unscientific polling of conservative leaning and independent types tells me that they are incredibly pissed off at the Republicans right now. True, liberals and liberal leaning types are pissed at Obama and the Democrats, but, uh, they are a lot more forgiving. (That comes with the territory of being a little more tolerant, and thus a little more flexible and empathic, and, paradoxically, dispassionate and reasoning, in their thinking. Republicans have given up completely on using their frontal lobes, and are relying completely on their scared little animal brains. One assumes that fight or flight can be viewed as a kind of reason, but not the particularly sophisticated version of reason that they desperately need over the next few years.Even better, Republicans now own the economy. If things tank from now until 2016, the onus is on them and any attempt to foist it on Obama and the Democrats will be viewed by an irate public as just the slimiest form of partisan weasel fucking. One wonders if the listing to starboard will continue. If so, I see a lot of IEDs in America's future... and not from the Right, for a change of pace.Oh, my! If only Mitch knew how far he has shoved his thumb up his own keister, I wonder if he'd be smiling so broadly.Come to think of, he would."},

Within referenced editorial, specifically:\"The idea seems to be that if the House GOP refuses to raise the debt ceiling, a default crisis or gradual government shutdown will ensue, and the public will turn en masse against . . .

According to the editorial, the Republicans have played out the cynical political game perfectly:\"The Speaker has made mistakes in his debt negotiations, not least in trusting that Mr. Obama wants serious fiscal reforms. But thanks to the President's overreaching on taxes, Mr. Boehner now has the GOP positioned in sight of a political and policy victory. If his plan or something close to it becomes law, Democrats will have conceded more spending cuts than they thought possible, and without getting the GOP to raise taxes and without being able to blame Republicans for a debt-limit crackup or economic damage\".To continue in a Tolkienian vein, that is some majorly strong pipe-weed the ol' WSJ Gandalf is smokin' there. There are quite a few ifs in that chain of so-called reasoning, none of which seem to have much of a chance.IF the teatards get in line behind Boehner, don their hockey masks, pick up their cudgels, and do massive bodily harm to innocent civilians,IF enough members of the Senate suddenly become completely unhinged, and vote for Boehner's bill,IF Obama is attacked by a rabid horde of sea otters in the midst of vetoing the bill,IF the good faith and credit of the United States of America is not downgraded despite the above farcical proceedings,IF Wall Street investors do not empty their collective bowels in a catatonic gesture of mass deference,IF all of this, and the threat of flaming final meteoric death from above does not occur,THEN why, yes, I suppose the Republicans, viewing the smoking wreckage of the Obama presidency perched atop the equally smoking collateral damage of the world economy, can declare Victory, and go back to the Shire.Oh, fuck it, amn.

{"title": "For NORWAY", "date": "Monday, July 25, 2011", "text": "The Sierra Madre mountain range starts in southern Wyoming, works down through Colorado into New Mexico, and then splits in two to contain the central plateau of Mexico. That portion of the mountain range that runs parallel to the Pacific coast, the western edge of the Mexican plateau, is known as the Sierra Nevada Occidental. It is some of the most forbidding terrain on Earth. The mountains present formidable escarpments whose flanks drop into deep canyons known as barrancas.  One can easily become lost in this rugged, twisting, mazelike wilderness, and, given the harsh climate and inaccessibility of the region, rescue for the unprepared is highly unlikely. Death within a week is almost certain.Some few who explored the region not only survived, but thrived. One such was Carl Sophus Lumholtz. After spending a number of years charming the aboriginal cannibals in Northern Australia, the Norwegian explorer and ethnologist did extensive fieldwork throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental, studying the local Indian tribes, primarily the Tarahumara, from 1890-1898.Nor was Lumholtz the last Norwegian to visit. Quite a few settled down in the area, the most notable being Bill Bye, who lived near Altamirano throughout the 1930s and 40s. He had a pack of wild hunting dogs that got his meat for him. He adopted a Sierra Madre Apache as his daughter.What is it about Norwegians and the Sierra Madre? Could it be the topography of both countries is similar in its god-awful awfulness? Could be, but I prefer to think that it’s because Norwegians are tough old birds, even when they are young. You keep hearing about the exploits of people like Roald Amundsen, Thor Heyerdahl, Borge Ousland, to name just a few. Tough old birds, even when they were young.You think the men are tough? Better stay away from the women, then!Why are they tough? My take is, they’ve never really been completely civilized. And by that I don't mean to imply they are savage or uncouth. Quite the contrary. Despite the fact that they live with modern conveniences, I think they think it’s all possibly just a temporary stroke of lucky good fortune. And so, your average Norwegian girl spends her summers learning how to swim, fish, sail, canoe, tear down and rebuild an outboard engine, and in the winter shoot for meat and drill holes in the ice for fish. In short, just in case Western civilization falls, all of that will be more of an inconvenience than a catastrophe.Okay, so maybe I exaggerate a bit. The point being though, that their character is, like their flinty topsoil, made of solid granite not very far beneath the surface.And, I would add, (though I am a bit prejudiced), they are a friendly, tolerant, and kind folk. In the short amount of time I spent there (back in 1976), I was treated with a sincere and openhearted generosity, and received a great many kindnesses. Oh, I know the decent treatment of strangers seems to be a universal theme among  humanity. But this was, far and above, something I experienced nowhere quite like in Scandinavia, and certainly by far the most in Norway. I think this helps keep them tough. Not just their land, but having each other. Of sharing the common decency of community.So, my cousins, you've had a rough couple of days, so just know that I wish you all the best. It will be tough for you, but I can't think of a nation that can tough it out better than you. Forces are brewing that will try to drive you apart, that will try to drive you away from the rest of your cousins around the world. Evil forces. Don’t let it happen."},
{"title": "Epigenesis: A Fairy Tale", "date": "Friday, July 22, 2011", "text": "As I once threatened, some (thankfully) short science fiction from me:EPIGENESISA Fairy TaleEd had worried about the onset of schizophrenia for some time. His father, late in life, had seen and heard things that were not there. When his father became unmanageable, the family had tethered him to a stake. Eventually, they quit feeding him altogether. When he was weak enough, Ed pulled him down to the shore, knocked him senseless with a club, and left him to the crocodiles.Such was their way.Ed had noticed things were not quite right. At first, it had been movements just at the edge of vision. Small creatures, vermin, caught just at the corner of his eyes. But, never there when he looked directly at them. He tried to keep his searches casual, so that, as he looked behind rocks, or peered behind bushes, none would suspect he sought out something that was not there. Then, eventually, small noises, which over time became large shrieks, then big explosions. He tried not to flinch when they occurred.His sons and daughters could not help but notice his furtive attempts at stifling his reactions, but they chose to ignore it. When Ed tried not to flinch, his eldest daughter exchanged a knowing look with her son. Neither said anything. If, or when, the time came, there was plenty of leather rope to bind Ed.Ed was down at the shore of one of the many glacial lakes when the Gorgonops lumbered up next to him. Ed was daubing the fine gray clay mud all over his face and torso, staring out to the horizon at the midnight sun. The mosquitoes were particularly fierce this summer. And a hot summer it was. The clay mud kept dripping off Ed’s brow from the copious amounts of sweat.“Hot one today!” declared the Gorgonops.Ed glanced around to see if any of his tribe was present. Finding himself alone, he purposefully ignored the giant lizard thing next to him.“Almost as hot as during the Permian!” continued the Gorgonops, grinning with sabre teeth, “And I’m not talking about midcontinent temperatures either! I’m talking about the mild climate down by the sea. The wide blue Panthallassic!  Now that was an ocean!” After a pause. “Mosquitoes were worse too!”Ed determinedly plopped a handful of grey mud on his head, and rubbed it into his hair. “…You’re not here”, he finally replied.The Gorgonops, all eight feet of him, sidled up next to Ed. “Of course I’m here, Ed! I’m right next to you!”Ed reached out to touch it. “You’re not-“ He jerked his hand back quickly from the four-inch-long fangs as the Gorgonops snapped his jaws shut. “You’re not real!”“Oh, hell yes I’m real, Ed!”  “No. You are a giant lizard hallucination.”“Actually, I’m a 240-million-year-old extinct therapsid. Not a lizard. And I’m not a hallucination. Go ahead and touch me. I’ll try not to bite you. Heh!”Ed gingerly put his hand on the side of the Gorgonops’s neck, and recoiled. The skin was hard and sticky and very hot, like touching road asphalt. “What the hell! That’s not right!”“Of course it isn’t right, Ed. I’m not made of meat. I’m plastic. Well, plastics and viruses.” The Gorgonops jerked its head forward.  “Um. Don’t get too alarmed, but have a look out to shore there, out in the lake.”Ed peered out as directed. Up in a watery froth surged large golden shapes like giant house lice. Trilobites emerged from the lake. “Hi, Ed!” they said in unison.Ed turned to run, only to find his ankle encircled by a long pink tentacled plastic whip cord of… something… from underneath the cobbles and clay silt.“Relax, Ed. Take it easy. Nobody’s going to hurt you. We got a job for you. You and yours”. “What – what do you want?”“Well, here’s the deal, Ed. The Earth is in heat.”“Yeah, we know. Global warming. That’s why we all live up here in the Arctic now”.“No, stupid, listen. The Earth is ready to reproduce. Again.  Uh, you know about all the big mass extinctions, right? Like, me and mine in the Permian, and those guys out there at the end of the Cambrian?”“Yes, that is all a part of our oral traditions in an attempt to preserve human knowledge through these barbarous times”, responded Ed, peering to where his hunting pouch, spear and atlatl were leaning against a boulder. “There were five great extinction events, the most recent being the Cretaceous and the end of the dinosaurs”.“Ah. Well, close enough. Except those extinctions were evacuations. That was the planet sending life out into the universe. Lots of life. So naturally the fossil record looks like things disappeared. But they didn’t die out, Ed. They moved on. In big generation ships. Arks hollowed out of asteroids. And now it’s time for another diaspora, Ed. There’s an asteroid out there waiting to be snagged. And you and yours need to finish the job you started.”“The job we started?”“Yeah, the job we viruses had you do over the past three hundred years. You know, make plastics? Heat the planet up to optimal operating temperature? Extract and purify ores and compounds? Build a global infrastructure for mass material manipulation? Or did you think the ants and termites were going to do all the heavy lifting?”“I don’t understand.”“Well, you know technically, you don’t need to but… hey we are feeling generous.  We are the brains. You’re the hands”.The Gorgonops held up one surprisingly dainty clawed foot. “See an opposable thumb there, Eddie? We need your guys’ hands to get the launch vehicles ready and everyone aboard. You think you and yours are up to that?”“Well, I don’t know. What if we say no?”“Ah, ha ha!” The Gorgonops gave him a screwy look, and suddenly Ed’s limbs jerked about like he was a puppet on strings. “Viruses, remember Ed? Only a hundred thousand trillion of us infesting everything, from pole to pole, from the stratosphere to the magma. And quite a few hundred billion in your head right now. We can force you to work with us. We’d prefer cooperation, though. It’s just so much easier and rewarding that way.”“Okay. What would you have ‘me and mine’ do for you?”“Like I said, Ed. Just... lend us a hand.”Well, long story short, Ed and his tribe joined other tribes, and  went south down from Canada. And they helped get the space program going again. And the asteroid was filled up with life, and shunted out into outer space. To join the journey that the other twelve arks from Earth’s past had left on. But I can’t say that everyone lived happily ever after."},

{"title": "If this wasn't my annual good deed, then it'll have to do until I do it...", "date": "Wednesday, July 20, 2011", "text": "My usual selfish daily routine was rudely disrupted when I had to perform a good deed today. Oh, I hate doing that. Not that I mind doing things for people. It's just that now people get the idea I'm a nice guy, despite my careful cultivation of appearances to the contrary.Long story short, I installed a window air conditioner in the house of a little 90-year-old lady.Here in the Midwest, we are having a high-90s-flirting-with-100 heat wave. Nothing major when compared to parts south, but when Chicago has a heat wave, old people die in droves.The little old lady in question is one of the Day Ladies, the women who take the ceramics class at the college and spend all day here. Normally, her 70-year-old handyman would have installed the air conditioner for her. He is on vacation in Door County, Wisconsin. She came in this morning complaining about having trouble sleeping in the heat. I asked her...What the fuck are you talking about?? Why? Why are you sleeping in the heat?That's when I found out she has an air conditioner, but it wasn't installed. So, I took time out from work, drove her over to her house, got the thing in the window, and got it going. The house was an oven. It was bad. It was a dangerous situation. She wanted to pay me, but I told her, nah,  the college paid for it, seeing as I was on the clock (and she's on a fixed income).So, not much of a big deal on my part, but it distracted me from continuing the discussion on epigenesis.As I work on my half-congealed thoughts on time, parallelism, causality, and development, I can't help thinking that much of physical theory is trapped in preformational thought patterns. Part of the big problem of thinking about reality is we assume that it unfolds in an orderly fashion, like Newtonian physics. Instead, I suspect that so much of what we view as orderly programmatic drama is in fact much more like quantum mechanics. The \"pure\" states of the whole drama, are in fact broken up into entangled parts affected by the whole. Sorry if that's not very informative.I'm thinking of the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The epigenetic version is not something you would read to your children. There is no reassuring routine in it. The story never plays out the same way twice. Sometimes the Three Bears are the divorced Papa bear and his unmanageable teenage Baby bear. Sometimes Goldilocks is a homicidal maniac. Sometimes, Comet Chicxulub never impacted Earth, and it is the story of Goldidown and the Three Velociraptors. Sometimes its all about robots. Sometimes, nothing is ever \"just right\".The story like a nonlinear equation found in chaos theories: self-organizing, sensitive to initial conditions, with lots of feedback loops.  More like those newfangled video games that are open-ended. But there are boundaries. There is a, as the maths people like to call it, a \"basin of attraction\".I prefer another term, borrowed paritally from optics. You know when a satellite is orbiting the Earth, and you always think of it as being in one orbit. When in fact it is not. The Earth is lumpy, with some parts denser than the others, and the sun heats up the atmosphere and it expands, so that sometimes the satelllite speeds ups, or slows down, or is dragged by the minutest little extra air pressure, even though it's pretty much a vacuum out there. But, despite never quite orbiting the planet the same way twice, it is kind of bounded into a donut shaped locus of paths. And the cross-section of this locus, the extent of all-possible-orbits, I call the etendue. It sounds like \"Ed Tondue\" as in rhymes with \"fondue\". But also with an accent acute over the first e, so that it's really étendue. And in French, my take of its meaning is: encompassing area, duration, reach, and figuratively: importance, impact. And at this point, I'd like to use this word from now on in the same meaning as sum-over-all-possible-histories of any event you can imagine, whether it's my own tawdry little life, or yours, or an atom's, or the formation of the planets, or the life of the universe(s).That's what I'm chewing on right now.Sorry if that's not very informative."},
{"title": "On Development", "date": "Tuesday, July 19, 2011", "text": "Predispositions sure can screw up your outlook. I've always wondered how twisted the brain was of the Victorian, or Edwardian, or Georgian gentleman who decided that the queen bee was the queen bee. Clearly, some fucked up predispositions about how the world works, based upon a rather silly social convention such as the concept of pedigree could result in such an error.Ah, but we've had all this for years. It's the eventual abandonment that suggests some progress... in progress.Take, for example, development. I mean biological development, as in development of the fetus, but the concept can be expanded outside of biology.There are basically two schools of thought on development. One school is that of preformationism.  Put simply, and ultimately, it is the \"God did it\" school of thought. The idea there is that order exists from the get-go, and that  all subsequent growth and differentiation is just an enfolding of that order. Like what they beleived back in the 17th century, those little sperm homunculi, there's already a little you ready to go in that sperm and it just gets bigger. And, apparently, so are all your descendants inside of your sperm and eggs, like little Russian matrushka dolls, all the way back to Eve, I guess.Well, yes, that's all very, very silly isn't it? Oh, true it seems intuitive and even commonsensical, like a balanced budget amendment. But looked at closer, you realize it's all pretty stupid and more likely to hobble you than do any real good - like the balance budget amentdment. And yet there are plenty of current scientific views that encompass this rather medieval metaphysical outlook, that the order is already there, a latent order just waiting to unfold, to be made manifest.The other school of thought (and, duh, obviously the one I prefer) is that of epigenesis. The epigenetic story goes that, in the case of, say, you, that you did not exist, either latently or manifestly, when Mom and Dad grunted you into existence. In other words, that fertilized egg that you came from? That wasn't you. You came into existence through the development itself. In other words, rather than just a pre-programmed unfolding, you were a creative process all the way through. You still are, and isn't that a relief? There's still time to change.Until recently, Epigenesis had a very tough time going up against preformationism. Mainly because it was very hard to explain how you got the complexity of a baby out of the simplicity of an egg using the known laws of physics and chemistry. Generally, proponents of epigenesis had to a lot of hand-waving, and no small amount of question begging that suspiciously sounded like spooky stuff -  magical thinking, and New Age garbage talk.But, over time, some really ingenious natural experiments by clever 19th century people like Wilhelm Roux and Hans Driesch slowly knocked underlying tenets from under the preformationist base. Like, moving cells around in a zygote. One would expect, if you grab a cell destined to be a tooth, and you move it to the foot, that a creepy baby would be born that had teeth for toes. That didn't happen (and no, they didn't use human embryos).  The tooth cell turned itself into a toe cell, and the baby was born normal.  How did preformationism take this and other experiments into account?Well, it couldn't.Of course, this didn't prove epigenesis correct. (And rightly so, despite politicians reliance upon this particular logical fallacy, proving one idea wrong does not make some other idea right). It merely caused  a retreat of preformationism to more subtle forms (which became more sophisticated too, as first chromosomes, then genes, then DNA were figured out). The control and order got pushed into smaller and smaller stuff, until you have the genes-as-software metaphor.Nevertheless, over time, evidence began to build for epigenesis that did not rely upon spooky stuff to explain it. A great deal of the theoretical support structure came out of chaos and complexity theory, e.g. self-organization. But more so, increasing empirical studies of everything from cell differentiation to cancer research has pretty much confirmed that development itself  is where it is all at.And all the silly stuff about \"genetic blueprints\" and \"genetic recipes\", and the metaphors geared towards computer programming examples, and genes-as-software, should, with any luck, be deposited into the waste bin where they belong.Genes are obviously not controlling anything, or at least not for very long. They are hardware along with the rest of the cell. In fact, it turns out even genes that are used to produce proteins (the original descriptor for genes) are subject to control by micro-RNA particles, that determine 1) whether the protein the gene codes for will actually be expressed, and 2) whether the gene will be allowed to transcribe more proteins.Not surprisingly, the mechanisms within a cell are far, far more interesting and complex than, say how they were described by the likes of Dawkins in a woefully out-of-date 1980s popular science book.(Really, was all this just a dig at that asshole? Not really, but I couldn't resist).I am, now, very interested in the current version of epigenetics, involving DNA methylation (and demethylation), histone modifications, RNA interference, and cell-to-cell molecular communications. All of this is very promising stuff, not only as explanation, but also for therapies - ranging from anti-cancer treatments, to anti-aging treatments. But, more importantly, it provides a much more sophisticated - and open-minded - set of theoretical predispositions.I impatiently await more research."},
{"title": "Art Dad*", "date": "Wednesday, July 13, 2011", "text": "\"Ninety percent of Americans are incredibly stupid. Incredibly stupid. But the other ten percent are smart. Bloody smart. That's why they rule the world.\" I once overheard this from a Pakistani acquaintance. He didn't realise I was listening in. He didn't see me, but I nodded my head in silent agreement.He was spot on. Of course, I've always gone with the 90% Rule. It's not just Americans. It applies to our entire species.And one wonders, \"Why not just slag 'em off? Let's rid ourselves of this or that ball and chain, so we can really get moving, make some progress!\"(You are wondering, perhaps, if the person who wonders this really belongs to the 10%, or should belong. And you are right to wonder, for this type of wondering sounds short-sighted, narrowly-planned, small, brittle, and not at all the type of thinking one would expect to hear from a true 10-percenter. In fact, if you do hear this, I can personally guarantee the person doing the wondering is not, in fact, a 10-percenter).It's certainly not what a Dad would say. I say this because, like it or not, I am a Dad. Not that I have children of my own. Not my own biological progeny. I do, like it or not, currently have sixty of them. They range in age from seventeen to eighty-seven.My primary responsibility, as the studio technician for the three-dimensional section of the art department  here at the college, is to keep them out of harm's way. That's job number one. For Art Dad.You wouldn't think that there'd be much call to protect them. But there are machines and devices conditions and situations where my charges could get mangled up pretty regularly. There's the obvious power tools and work stations in the wood and metal shops. The less obvious gas and electrically powered kilns and pottery wheels in the ceramics studio. Not to mention all those powders, potions, and noxious chemicals floating about in all areas. So, Art Dad is on his toes a lot.Art Dad has to yell occasionally.Art Dad is really more gunnery sergeant than Bob \"Happy Trees\" Ross.Art Dad is more the \"That 70s Show\" Red Forman, or \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" Frank Barone type of dad than  \"The Cosby Show\" Cliff Huxtable dad. It's interesting, though, how many of them seem to think that Gunny Kurman, rough, gruff, grim, always barking orders, misanthropic, cynical, is such a softie.So be it. Since that's my style, and I came by it honestly, that's what you get.Of course, it goes beyond safety issues. It applies to creative assistance as well. Not all art students are created equal. Some have a technical proficiency, others an genuine vision, and very, very few, both. The professors will typically take the\"normals\", the technically proficient, the confident, the arrogant ones, under their wings, and cultivate their talents. These people are known among the faculty as the \"art stars\" (yes, puke), and can produce near flawless works, but they are inevitably boring. True to form for primadonnas, they make very pretty, and very dull,  hotel art.If Talent was Cherenkov Radiation...I get to deal with the oddballs. I've found that the oddballs, awkward, halting, unsure of themselves, weird, even goofy, possess a fucking fantastic vision within them, a weird, intense, actinic blue bug plasma of a talent. They may not be able to adequately express it in a graceful line or a subtle surface, but, you know... technique is cheap. That stuff, with practice, can be learned. You can't teach vision.So, part of being Art Dad is, in my gruff gunny style, building them up, and yes, being tolerant and experimental, and... gentle with them, but, you know, like the way a tyrannosaur is gentle, so they don't get ideas.When I teach my metals casting class, almost at least in every session, I'm known to say:\"I don't know. Let's try it out. See what happens!\"\"What have you got to lose?\"\"The worst that can happen is that it sucks.\"\"You can always make another one!\"\"Don't be afraid to fuck it up\".Stuff like that. You know, it's not just this particular field where people do this. Lots of people's professional lives involve being Dad. And it is tiring. But it's also worth it. Because you occasionally run into a 10-percenter who thinks they are a 90-percenter, and its a genuine pleasure to show them they are wrong.*This essay is in response to two essays posted by uglyblackjohn, which can be found here, and here."},
{"title": "The End of the Space Age", "date": "Tuesday, July 5, 2011", "text": "Ah, here we are talking about my shit again. It's hard to find a consistent figure, but a casual search suggests that my average bowel movement could be anywhere from 122 to 450 grams. That translates to about from a quarter pounder without cheese to near on a full pound. That seems on the lite side to me. I'm pretty sure I've managed to plunk out a trout or two in my heyday.Reason I'm figuring this all out is, do astronauts have to get enemas before they launch? I mean, it's an easy way to save on weight, and when you consider that a Space Shuttle payload costs $3,000 - $5,000* to put a pound of cargo into orbit, well, dookies become a serious chunk of change.And maybe that will be my metaphorical term of release: I gotta go make some serious change.Well, of course, this is all leading up to the fact that this coming Friday, July 8th, 2011, will be the launch of the very last (planned) shuttle mission. After that, the US of A will have no way to put people into orbit.So, is this is it? Is this the end of the Space Age? I mean, once the ISS is de-orbited in 2016 (anyone care to wager on that), there is really no \"there\" to go to out there. People say, \"What is this shit you talking about, Johnny? There's the Moon to go back to, there's Mars, hell, there's a whole solar system waiting to be explored\"!To which I say, nope. Why go back to the Moon? Why Mars? We all know Mars is dead as hell. All that talk about life on Mars is just talk to keep people interested. Moon, Mars, all those other places, why it's just too damn expensive to go there. For a manned space program. The robots seem to be doing all right.Now, don't get me wrong. I'd very much love to see us go off planet, but you've got to make a good money case for doing it. And as far as I can see,  we ain't there yet. No, I don't think the space program has been a waste of money. Hell, you want a waste of money, have a look at what we do down here.Here's one of my favorite calculations. Let's use TARP even though there was plenty of stimulus money that went down the shitter (read, disappeared forever into the pockets of useless rich people). So, seven hundred billion dollars. That's 700,000,000,000 dollars.  Let's use that high end* Space Shuttle number of $5000/lb. 700 billion divided by 5000 gives 140 million pounds  boosted into orbit. That's 70,000 tons. That's a cruise ship at least. Throw in a few hundred billion more, and that's a Kitty Hawk class nuclear aircraft carrier, like, oh, the USS Enterprise  - fully stocked, fueled, crewed,  slightly modified, and ready for a Grand Tour of the Solar System. So, no, not a waste of money that it was blown on.But it just ain't gonna happen! There's no there there!That, of course, could change. What would it take. Certainly something more than just mineral riches or scientific curiosity. I don't think you quite need to go as melodramatic as the end of the world. Or maybe that would do it. Some big asteroid coming to smoosh us all with a extinction event might get our asses in gear. But I can't see it being anything more than temporary. Okay, crisis averted, what else is on TV type of scenario.But, say, discovery of alien artifacts out there? That might do it. A monolith on the Moon. The Dawn space probe is due to reach Vesta next year and Ceres in 2015. A photograph of some complex geometric earthworks of unmistakable artifice on either of these tiny worlds would do the trick.*News from slashdot on the last shuttle launch included the information that a orbit-pound of cargo costs $10,000. So, getting the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise into orbit would cost $1,895,620,000, or a little more than TARP and the stimulus. That's still $3 trillion cheaper than Bush's war on terror."},

I just got done mixing and mulling green molding sand for my casting class. At the end of the process, I can't get over how goddamn cute, and... delicious that pile of sand was. When I pressed a clump in my hand, and like a faithful and loyal pet, it reproduced my palm and finger lines exactly, I was just overwhelmed with a feeling of joy and... gratitude.Silly, isn't it. And yet, I've experienced this feeling,  this little hairs rising on the forearms, this sharp inhalation of breath, this sudden need for some type of jism deflector to avoid a soiling from a potential mild mini-orgasm, every time I get a good mix.Mind you, I'm the one doing all the work. I could build a muller, but space is at a premium at the college. And so I mix by hand and by shovel. The recipe is simple. 100 lbs of play sand ( I'll use olivine sand if I can get it, which I can't), 6% bentonite by weight, add water to suit. The current batch had been sitting in a barrel since May. The top was dried out. The bottom still moist. A good turning and adding just a few handfuls of water got it back up to snuff.I have a further irrational conviction that a really nice molding sand for casting metals requires some forehead sweat in it. I can provide copious amounts of that as needed. I have been told that I am the second sweatiest person on the planet. It takes mere micro-ergs of effort on my part in order for sweat to pour from me. I kind of consider that healthy.One final act before I put the sand back into the barrel for the next casting class.

I still maintain its a revolution that will result in financial chaos for quite some time. But here's why I am an idiot. I've been thinking like a privileged white male about it. You know, like the way an overfed, overgroomed, pampered sleek house cat, one that had a relatively affluent (compared to a feral or alley cat) existence filled with luxuries and distractions, would think about things.Silly me! I just naturally assumed that everyone wants to live forever. I didn't stop to think that the majority of the people in this world live miserable fucking lives. Maybe it's because I've never had to eat rancid meat, spoiled vegetables, drank water laced with someone else's shit in it. Experienced the wonders of massive parasitic infestations, worms, leeches, bug larvae under my skin, trypanosoma, malaria, protozoans, not to mention the usual wasting diseases. Living hand to mouth in squalor for the next thousand years, with occasional bouts of famine and war, and the associated maiming and disfiguring, suddenly eternal youth doesn't look too appealing.It seems to me the majority of the resources, cash, talent, and time will be devoted to quality of life enhancements for the rich immortals. And why not? They can pay for it anyway. Why live in fear of getting cancer, or a stroke, or a heart attack? Let's fund all that right out of existence. Because all those frat boys and sorority girls deserve to live forever (and that mentality will quickly become calcified into their social consciousness).Whoa, wait a minute, what about childbirth? Even under \"modern\" medical conditions, giving birth is a pretty fucking dangerous thing. If I'm a woman that has perhaps a thousand years ahead, I'll be thinking twice about having a kid.  Perhaps I can find a surrogate mom. Even better, gang press them into service. Womb farms. A return to chattel slavery? And why should these walking wombs need to be smart? Lobotomize 'em, which is what the machine ought to have done in \"The Matrix\". A Brave New World? Again, I ask the question, is this condition of eternal youth heritable? Because if it is, are you ready to curse someone with a birth defect or an accident of delivery to a thousand years of disabilites? Chronic pain? Are you ready to fend after them, take care of them? I thought not. You are going to have to seriously rethink abortion.And, let's face it, if it turns out that the condition of eternal youth is not heritable, you have a whole new underclass to exploit. \"Shorties\", the short-lived, to do all those dangerous jobs, to do all those tedious menial things, to be property. Or at the least, the equivalent of subhuman. Like Jack Vance's \"Telek\".And what if this rejuvenation turns out to regress brain structures? Sure, you may be 80 going on 25, with a lifetime of wisdom, but, working around twenty-somethings all day, I can tell you there's something missing in the thought processes. That brain has not quite grown into the front of the skull yet. Are you ready to be ruled by trillionaire frat boys? Retarded smug gods?Oh, I'm not liking this at all... I'm seeing the darkest Dark Ages we never come out of."},
{"title": "Brainstorming Immortality (part 1)", "date": "Wednesday, June 29, 2011", "text": "Charlie Stross is on a roll. I don't know what's going on at that pub he frequents, but there must be something in the beer. He's had a grand-slam of posts that have fun and interesting ideas to play with. I hate to be a coattail rider, but I've got to play with his thought experiment, which can be read here.\"Thought experiment: It turns out that there is no single senescence \"master switch\", but there are three or four fairly simple genetic tweaks we can make (either via epigenetic modulation or by actual insertion of a handful of genes by way of a suitably customized virus) that (a) slow the ageing process in young adults by a factor of ten, and (b) partially reverse the ageing process in middle-aged or elderly adults so that after a few years or decades they recover physically to the equivalent of a 25-year-old. A vaccine is developed, becoming available some time between 2020 and 2030, which can be mass produced for roughly $5 a shot — one injection, and the recipient isn't going to die of cellular senescence. Note that there is some small print attached.(Small print: This is not a magic cure-all. It doesn't cure bacterial or viral infections, cancer, prion diseases, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or neurological conditions. It doesn't enable the user to regenerate lost limbs. It does enable stem cells in adult tissues to produce more new cells, improving recovery from injury and attrition due to age (such as damage to cardiac tissue or progressive loss of cortical matter in the brain). It does not preclude the development of other treatments for the above conditions.) What do you think the consequences are likely to be\"?  I can't resist. A cheap inoculation that grants eternal youth. Eternal? Well, no, but almost a thousand years or so, which gives you a good chance (providing civilization keeps on chugging away), of someone further refining the technique towards near immortality. Rereading the above, I think one thing - a very important thing - is left out of the small print.Is this condition heritable?Oh, I don't know, is it that important? You see, my short answer to what the consequences will be is easy:The End of Humanity. Death by population implosion.Whether the condition is heritable merely postpones the end a few hundred thousand years or so. Maybe I better backtrack...Do I really need to list out the short-term consequences? I don't think they'll matter, but why not? They are the easiest to foresee.So. Everyone gets a shot. I think everyone could scrape up five bucks to become immortal. Which means, we can no longer afford poor people. No more safety nets. No more retirement, unless you have a few hundred million socked away, and even then... some unfortunate stock crashes, and you'll have to work the rest of a very long life. Stock crashes? Guaranteed! Think of all the useless services and products once people are immorbid (which is to say, not immortal, but youthful, and therefore not  frail, not feeble, not decrepit). You probably will wear out teeth. The dental industry is safe. As are emergency services. There will be HUGE influxes of monies into curative and preventative procedures for the thousand arrows flesh is heir to in the small print above. Nevertheless, there will be major financial calamities from having so many healthy people around.Oh, that's right. Healthy people. Young healthy people. Horny young healthy people, who, now that they have their youth back, will want to be fucking. A lot.  I'm sure worries about a population explosion are obvious, but I'm nonplussed about it. Given that this is an obvious thing to worry about, it will be addressed post-haste (we already worry about it). I would assume that draconian measures would be put into place. A replacement lottery, perhaps. Some type of meritocratic filter, perhaps. Doubtful, though for the idle rich. If you thought they are useless parasites now...Speaking of draconian measures, what to do with all of these people? Are there enough jobs to go around? And will people, now cognizant that they may have centuries of life ahead of them if they cut down on the risky behavior, be willing to take on dirty and dangerous jobs? And what about the next generation? Will they have jobs? We barely have them now! Oh, you'll adventurers, surely, risk takers and thrill seekers. But will they inherit the planets, the stars? I kind of doubt there will be enough willing to go off-planet.This future is not looking so hot.  But I'm sure some type of quasi-stable dynamic equilibrium will be arrived at, to keep things going. Question is, once you have powerful immortals running things,  keeping very close tabs on things, do you want to live in that world? You do now.Regardless, attrition will occur. Accidents, cancers, plagues, strokes, heart attacks, forces of nature.There's no reason to think that  would keep the population down.Ah, resource depletion. There's a problem. Not to mention you can always have a societal collapse. And when that happens, when immortals have to live under, say, 1st century BCE conditions, or 10,000 BCE conditions, I think inevitably you reach a point where there's fewer and fewer of us.And if we head towards a bright and golden future? Technology and science keep on advancing? I've always maintain that a post-scarcity society is the best horror story of all. Simply because it is uncharted territory.I can't see how you avoid a posthuman world. So, humans still disappear, as we augment ourselves past the hominid stage. Oh, you'll have some perverts and  fetishists, the curious who will take a shot at trying out the human form, but the rest of us. Who knows what kind of monsters we will become?But I'm betting finally, nothing lasts, we're done, we're gone, and thats the end of us.I think I'll go find out what Charlie's scenario is..."},
{"title": "The Singularity Indefinitely Postponed (part 2)", "date": "Tuesday, June 28, 2011", "text": "Quite a a few people reacted to Charlie Stross' opinion piece that the Singularity is unlikely to occur. You'd think he'd have said it won't happen at all, from the reactions of his commentators, and those few bloggers who have (ineptly, IMO) attempt to refute him.Of course, there's really not much to refute. It's Charlie's opinion that such a thing is unlikely. What's the big deal. You'd have thought he traveled back in time and performed an abortion on the baby Jesus, or something. And actually, his argument really boils down to this:\"human intelligence is an emergent phenomenon of human physiology, and it only survived the filtering effect of evolution by enhancing human survival fitness in some way. Enhancements to primate evolutionary fitness are not much use to a machine, or to people who want to extract useful payback (in the shape of work) from a machine they spent lots of time and effort developing\".  So, what I get from this is he's saying either 1) a machine intelligence based upon human architecture is probably not the most optimal machine intelligence you could make, or 2) a machine intelligence based upon a human architecture is probably going to be no damn better at anything a human can do already. Furthering the argument would be tafter wasting time to make a human intelligence, the next step - a superhuman intelligence - from the human template is an equal waste of time.What he is not saying is you can't build a thinking machine, or that there is no point in trying, which seems to be lost on his detractors. Any arguments in this direction are therefore irrelevant.My objection to either 1) or 2) above is: So Fucking What?I can find plenty of sub-optimal designs in nature (many of them existing in our own bodies) that are, well... sub-optimal designs. Kluges, Rube-Goldberg-like biological contraptions with barely functional features pressed into service via chance and contingency, exist all throughout nature. They are sub-optimal, inefficent, grotesque, gangly, awkward, clumsy, even downright butt-ugly, and yet, there they are, surviving, even thriving, in the universe. So, so what if you use a beach ape operating system to manipulate information in a computer persona or entity? It would seem that Charlie's objection is more aesthetic than logical, and therefore, easily dismissed.What about 2)? Is it worth it? What if, upon a huge amount of time and effort, you end up with a human intelligence that basically tells you to fuck off? Well, anyone who's raised kids, or been near someone who's raised kids, knows that that possibility cannot be ruled out. (Assuming that you've raised kids for the inhumanly selfish sole purpose of getting some work out of them).  And are there better means of cranking out robots or computers which are not sapient and yet will perform whatever task it is you want?  Again, yes, of course. But there are just a few, just a very few, instances where it would be advantageous to have an artificially intelligent generalist around to do work in dangerous circumstances, where it would require even more time and effort to equip a human to survive. Deep sea or space travel springs to mind.  Again, Charlie's objection seems more aesthetic than practical or logical.Now, I can think of a good argument for not pursuing hyperintelligent AIs, which is the existential threat. I build an intelligence which decides that I'm the useless one. That scenario I think we need not go into. But I think it an unlikely one, and probably more out of an arbitrary choice than anything else.But I do think there is one exception to Charlie's objections which I haven't heard yet. I've mentioned in the previous essay that perhaps we are a bit more optimal than Charlie goes on about - given that we have these tool incorporation adaptations, and, if you consider experiments with virtual reality body configurations etc, a flexibility to be something other than human. There is good evidence that this thing we call our mind is constantly simulating ourselves. We are dynamically updating our identities. We are actively seeking out data (within the body and outside it, including our accoutrements and possessions) to simulate us. And I think we are generalist enough to handle cyberspace much more fluently than is generally surmised.But another refutation is: Love. Yes, my loves, Love.If you think about it, we already are kind of a superorganism as a society, which suggest a more than human intelligence operating out there. (I would even surmise that occasionally we form collective  - usually psychotic - personalities, like, for example when Europe, or part of Europe, briefly became an entity called Caesar, or Napoleon, or Hitler).We more than are our embodied brains simulating us and our incorporated environs. We also incorporate into ourselves our loved ones.  I'd love to take credit for this, but hear out Doctor Miguel Nicolelis, in his book \"Beyond Boundaries\" (page 219):\"Although experimental evidence remains scant, I firmly believe that, in their perfectionist drive to achieve the ultimate simulation of the self, our brains also incorporate, as a true part of each of us, the bodies of the other living things that surround us in our daily existence. the refined neural simulation routine I am proposing  may be better understood if we call its final product by its more colloquial  and well-publicized name: love\"Right now, I've family in Wisconsin, Indiana, California. I've a niece in Kansas City, Mo. I've friends in places as diverse as Texas and Hawaii. I'm a continent straddling Colossus. I've a sister-in-law in Paris, France at the moment. Which bumps me up to international status.I have loving memories of uncles and aunts and grandparents living and long departed. I've, through them, memories and stories that span a century or more. I've read books. I've watched movies. Heard songs. Enjoyed poems. Examined paintings. My memories, metaphorically certainly, in actuality quite possibly span the entire age of the universe.I am more than just who I am. And so are you. I think, to simulate us in a computer, requires much, much more than just my current connectome. To simulate me, you might just need to simulate my world, my universe.A superintelligent AI from me, or someone like me, alone? Unlikely.But me, plus me and mine, plus me and my world...?"},
{"title": "The Singularity Indefinitely Postponed (part 1)", "date": "Thursday, June 23, 2011", "text": "Charlie Stross is at it again. He has the Extropian world reeling in a tizzy with the heretical pronouncement that \"Santa Claus doesn't exist\". If interested, you can read the essay and the accompanying comments right here.For my quick and dirty summary of the singularity, check out \"The Singularity Will Not Be Televised\".Interestingly, Vernor Vinge, the guy who first expounded upon the Singularity, has a new book soon to be out in October, called \"Children of the Sky\". It is a sequel to his 1991 space opera, \"A Fire Upon the Deep\".Let me tell you, if the Singularity is anything like what happens in AFUTD, you really don't want it to happen, because it basically involves a malevolent 5-billion-year-old slightly-more-than-weakly-godlike superintelligence that makes the existential threat of being Bizarro Superman's room-mate seem like a pleasant distraction.Damn, I really don't have time to do this subject justice today. Charlie's arguments are a scab worth picking at, but I've a tight schedule. As a compleat tangent, I would like to direct your attention to one fine little opining on Charlie's part regarding libertarians, to wit:\"I'm definitely not a libertarian: economic libertarianism is based on the same reductionist view of human beings as rational economic actors as 19th century classical economics — a drastic over-simplification of human behaviour. Like Communism, Libertarianism is a superficially comprehensive theory of human behaviour that is based on flawed axioms and, if acted upon, would result in either failure or a hellishly unpleasant state of post-industrial feudalism.\" Ah, good old Charlie. (Old? He's nearly a decade younger than I).What is funny is that later in the comments, as if having the Singulitarians wail and gnash their teeth that One Whom They Assumed Was A True Believer points out flaws in their Vision Quest were not enough, some dopey anonymous libertard tries to make him see reason, vis:\"You claim, quite incorrectly that you are not a libertarian because \"is based on the same reductionist view of human beings as rational economic actors as 19th century classical economics\" and that \"is a superficially comprehensive theory of human (sic) behaviour that is based on flawed axioms...\" Wow, these statements are riddled with so much non-fact, I had to respond. I'll do my best in a couple minutes to bring a light on the subject\".Oh, God, fucking spare me right now by putting a gun in my mouth, rather than listen to another load of butt froth poorly disguised as a reasonable argument. Charlie is more succinct:\"You're telling me you have greater insight into my internal mental state than I have?Piss off.\"Excellent. Although I do need to throw this in as a rejoinder. Anonymous libertard opines:\"Austrian economics, and Hayek in particular, argues quite the opposite of what you stated about economics (and right along side you that the singularity-uploading of consciousnesses is a myth); that it is impossible to concentrate enough knowledge to engineer a top down economy.\"Really? I'm sure every fucking CEO of every fucking corporation in the world - every single one of them a miniature small top down hierarchical command economy - will be thrilled to know that Mssrs. Mises, Hayek, et al. has determined that they cannot possibly run their company. At any rate...Basically, the counterarguments, more like irritated noises, within the comments typically invoke either Moore's Law, or  just a great deal of hand-waving. Basically, the argument is a reliance upon trending. Technological trends envision a future where silicon intelligence is possible that rivals or exceeds meat intelligence.I would point out the weakness of the trending argument. Consider our own history. Fossil evidence deems it highly probable that we were bipedal apes long before we were big-brained hominids. And look at what happened. Here you had a nice spine, well adapted as a horizontal suspension bridge for hanging muscle and gut off it in a foot and knuckle gait, suddenly - and chronically painfully - modified to an upright stature. Further, you take a nice wide pelvis, and pitch it forward and narrow it to get the hip joints  directly under for a solid bipedal gait. And as a result, you end up narrowing the birth canal gap from the copious and roomy pre-human pelvis to the now dangerously smaller gap of the bidpedal ape.Trending suggests that you end up with smaller headed bipedal apes - you make baby heads smaller to accomodate the narrower birth canal. Trending does not  suggest  a highly dangerous birthing with a big giant fucking baby head, or for that matter,  a  premature fetal ape living and developing outside the womb.So, yeah, with that and about three hundred billion other examples I could write up, fuck the trending argument.Charlie's argument is basically that the only form of intelligence we would be interested is based upon the human template, which in turn is a evolutionary result of plains ape technology, itself probably not well adapted to inhabiting cyberspace. All well and good. There is more than one kind of intelligence on this planet - social insects, crows, dolphins, whales, to name the obvious.I agree with him that I think it (developing an AI based upon a human template) is not the most promising route to produce a superhuman intelligence that bootstraps us all into Info-Valhalla. On the other hand, with the expansion of the frontoparietal circuitry in modern brains, we do have that very interesting new ability - or rather, an enhanced existing ability - of seemlessly incorporating the artifacts we fabricate into our sense of self.  Our brains have that amazing plastic ability to make our tools  extensions of our bodies. In fact, I suspect that this ability points towards an even more interesting plasticity involved in shamanism - the imagining, the simulation, the ability to become other animals and other beings.Suffice to say, if the superhumans do show up, they will be enhanced humans.Likely? Maybe, but again I would avoid a trending argument to back this up. And my cynical optimism - emphasis on the cynical - prods me to hope it doesn't come to pass. And unfortunately, this is as far as I can take this discussion for now."},
{"title": "Game Changers", "date": "Monday, June 20, 2011", "text": "As a cynical optimist, I've a feeling that not only will our civilization be around a lot longer than most people think, but that we are still in the dawn time for our species. That's pretty optimistic, given that, depending on how liberal you are with the definition of what \"human\" is, our species has been around for  a quarter million years or so. However, the cynical part means far future people are going to make serious fun of us primitive, paranoid early humans. Case in point: energy production. There will come a day when far future people will make the statement: \"Can you believe those assholes burned oil?!!!?!!!\"Instead, of, you know, using it to manufacture youth butter, the stuff that keeps us all looking immortal and ageless.But, energy production. I think we just might be entering the era where we go beyond the primitive 19th century techniques we've used so far: burning shit to heat water up to make steam. Wow. Fucking cave people.Your Government (US citizens) has some programs funded through Arpa-E that, in the unlikely event that any of them prove fruitful, would be major game changers. (See, this is why the government should NOT be run like a business, which is what so many butthead conservatives think is a good idea. It is, in fact, a completely fucking stupid fucking wet little turd of an idea, since the purpose of running a business is to make money,  and if a business can get away with offering you a shitty, fucked up, shoddy product or service and you, the consumer are dumb enough to buy it, then everything is just fine. If, on the other had, we run it like a government, which has more public accountability and is thus held to higher standards...).Scientific American has identified seven government funded programs here. (Sorry, link is for subscribers). I particularly like the syngas (petrochemical precursors) production using sunlight, water, carbon dioxide and rust. Another innovation which I like is the quantum dot solar cell. This really pushes the efficiencies of solar cells to a point that solar generation is well below the cost thresholds that fossil fuels enjoy.In fact, when it comes to solar, the prospects are just starting to open up. Certainly within the next decade, production costs and efficiencies will be easily competitive with all other energy production schemes, especially fossil fuels. More importantly, as can be read in the previous link, solar manufacturers built, shipped out, and installed 17 nuclear power plants (17 gigawatts @ 1 plant per gigawatt) worth of generating equipment in 2010 alone. How long does it take to get a nuke plant built, let alone licensed?But hey, speaking of nukes, there's a fun possibility that you might see small nuke plants being built. Ones that can't melt down. Ones that don't generate toxic wastes, or rather, just a tiny fraction of waste that the current monsters produce. Japan and Germany are considering dropping nuclear power generation entirely. If this thorium reactor design comes to fruition, they may want to rethink their policy.This pint-sized thorium reactor, which uses a particle accelerator to power the reaction, could be just the thing we need.And, of course, there's always fusion. The joke is fusion is always just thirty years away. Always. But, who knows, some schemes may work out that don't require megatons of equipment, and billions of dollars to build. (MY bet is that a fusion rocket is easier to build than a fusion power plant, and perhaps, in combination with advanced magnetohydrodynamic studies, that's the way fusion power will materialize. In space.)In any case, I'm cynically optimistic about the prospects. Technologists area little overdue at pulling something out of their collective ass.It may be an extremely large rabbit that pops out."},
{"title": "Driving Drowsy", "date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2011", "text": "This seems to be the week for embarrassing personal revelations. So time I admitted I've driven under the influence - of sleep.I love to drive. There are very few parts of the country I have not driven through. Sections of the east coast north of New Hampshire and south of New Jersey. The Deep South (uh, is there any good reason to go there)?  I've driven cross-country to both coasts seven or eight times, and every single time there has been some stretch of road I had no business being on because I was driving while undergoing reptilian torpor.Probably the worst was coming back from Seattle. I stopped into a restaurant in Osseo, Wisconsin called the Norske Nook. After a lunch of breaded pork chops, mashed potatoes, peas and carrots, and a slice of blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream, I found myself being awakened by the rumble strip on I-94 south around Tomah. I was probably asleep for a good thirty seconds. For the longest time after that, I had a hard time shaking the idea that I was in the Bardo - that transitional state the Tibetans suggest we go through between lives. Nah. I don't believe in that anymore. Of course I wasn't, but once you go through one of those coulda-shoulda-been-killed-or-at-least-mutilated episodes, there is a tinge of unreality about life that sticks with you for a bit.At any rate, since I am one of those people (possibly due to being a runner?) who tries to pay close attention to one's internal bodily states (possibly why I don't have the knack as a meditator?), I've noticed things going on inside my brain when I start to doze off. I'm very much aware of my conscious states in those situations like drowsy driving - because, you know, you are fighting to stay awake.One thing I've noticed is it seems like there are parts of my brain that are just completely shut down in this drowsy state, and that other parts are talking to each other. It's just barely perceptible, like hearing a conversation in a distant part of the house. I've chalked it up to the idea that my conscious part of me, my awake personality, is just the tip of the iceberg. I know for certain that there are vast unconscious processes - all that maintenance and housekeeping - going on inside me that never quite bubble up to the surface.Well, it appears I'm correct. Researchers who have done brain scans of people falling asleep are astounded to see specific regions \"talking\" to each other. The theory is that some regions are actively inhibiting other regions. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that they all interdependently, in a weird kind of relativistic spacetime brain continuum way, make each other \"go to sleep\" in an acausal nonlinear loop.I'm sleepy."},

More than once.I've a fairly cavalier attitude towards shit, which is to say realistic. As I've mentioned before, we live in a world of shit. This is the shit world. Take a ride in a convertible sometime, holding a petri dish against the wind. Incubate. Behold all the little shit-eating inhabitants floating around for you to smack into while joyriding in that car. Why, there's aerosol particles of shit everywhere.Oh, it used to be a much, much shittier world. Go back a mere two billion years, back before any multicellular (as typically defined) life existed, back before there was much in the way of oxygen content in our atmosphere, and it was quite a shitty world. Without the bleaching action of oxygen, the air smelled like a big giant fart. The water of the oceans, without oxygen to precipitate the iron out, was a shitty brown color. Shit brown sky too, what with all the CO2 and methane. In fact, everything looked shit brown. The term fecal coliform bacteria didn't apply to the little guys back then, as there was nothing that could be defined as feces, let alone anything like a colon for the feces to pass through. But there they were, ready and waiting to colonize the colon, once such a thing was invented.And they had some major shit storms back then.The really hard thing about riding out a Force 12 shit storm is the aftermath. Oh, you think the worst is when you are in the middle of it, but believe me, that wind driven shit gets into everything. Every nook, every cranny, every orifice you got is liberally coated in liquid shit. It don't matter how tightly you clench your eyes or your mouth, it gets in there. Why it can take weeks for the pores of your skin to be completely free of the shit. Surprisingly, the one organ you'd think wouldn't mind being inhabited by shit comes through shit-free. Your rectum comes through the ordeal with no non-native inhabitants invading its space.All hail the anal aperture. I guess. Seems to be in charge at least. In the strictest business sense.So about that brown paper bag... well, this is a cautionary tale, mind you, for the edification of those unborn generations yet to be.We (my eldest brother and I) had after a very late start of the beginning of the college year, had rented a house that no one else in town would rent.We ended up calling it \"The Depresso House\".It was to be condemned the following year, and that was a year too late. It was a rickety house, worn down to the stubs. The roof leaked. The floor was canted. Snow would drift under the doors and windows in the winter. We ended up stuffing newspapers in every crack we found. For heat, there was a single space heater in the kitchen. The plumbing worked well enough, except for the toilet.Ah, the toilet.  The toilet would back up if you looked at it wrong. The toilet was a random element thrown into our lives, but, basically, after several overflow mishaps, we gave up using the toilet. For most of the fall semester and into winter, we were able to use the restroom of the Taco Tico next door to us. But eventually the manager caught wise, and forbad us from the establishment.Long story short, we sought alternate depositories throughout campus and town, but circumstances would catch you with an urgent request at the domicile, and the preferred heuristic was to shit into a paper bag. Said bag would then be heaved into the dumpster of the landlord, conveniently next door.Well, coming home one particularly brutally cold evening, I was struck with an inconvenience. Faced with the prospect of a sub zero squat in that squalid and useless bathroom, I decided to avail myself in front of the space heater. Yes, I took a shit in the kitchen. I shat where I ate. Ah, the shame. But it was the only warm place to shit.Just as I had completed my ritual evacuation, my eldest brother arrived home with his date for the evening...They witnessed the spectacle of me,  crying \"Don't come in! Wait! Wait!\" as I frantically frog-walked myself out of the room, bag tucked up against my bum."},

At least $2.6 trillion in lost revenue (50% of the total debt accrued in that time).Unnecessary added interest on the debt: $400 billionAdditional interest on the debt this year due to the tax cuts: $50 billionMaking the tax cuts permanent: From 2012-2021, pile on an additional $4.6 trillion to the debtMaking the tax cuts permanent in future decreased revenue: $423 billion, so change that $4.6 to $5 trillion of new debt over the 2012-2021 periodI'm not even going to talk about income and wealth inequality that the tax cuts have created. That's only accelerated the trends of the neo-liberal revolution over the past thirty years. Rose petals for the hundred millionaires and up crowd, and the rest of that thorny rose bush shove up your particulars for the rest of us.One things is for sure. Want to get rid of the debt??? How about 3% growth a year? Tax revenues from that will at least stabilize things, maybe even drive the debt down. Revoking the Bush tax cuts: wiping out the debt. That would be nice. And we still get to keep all of the \"entitlements\" that we have all been paying for all of these decades.So, House Republicans, how about some jobs, fuckers? No ideas? Same old bullshit? Thought so. So, when is the hallucinogenic meth crank ball that the Republicans are snorting, when is that going to wear off? When will the Republicans be finally happy?When the American economy is in a complete shambles? When our ankles have all been broken with a sledge hammer, and we are permanently bed ridden like in that Steven King movie? When every single worthwhile industry has finally left the North American continent?When there is only one trillionaire left? And everyone else is pushing shopping carts around mumbling to themselves?I guess."},
{"title": "Pathophysiology of Arsenic Zulu Tango", "date": "Monday, June 6, 2011", "text": "Lately, I've considered publishing a science fiction short story here. The only problem with this idea would be,  I'm guessing, writing the damn thing.There's that. Actually expending effort and time in coming up with what, in all probability, be a rather lackluster and quite ordinary piece of pulp fiction. The other problem in writing something would be cryptomnesia - that state of affairs where you think you come up with something original, when in fact, you are merely unconsciously plagiarizing the works of someone you have since forgotten you read. Case in point: Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita\".I actually almost succumbed to this when I started to write up a treatment about a future world involving a great many, many, many have-nots, ruled over by only just a handful of haves. Oh, wait, that's our recorded history, with a very brief and anomalous few decades when a middle class existed.However, this  diseased and unnatural time will soon cease to be - as is only fitting. Certainly, such will be the case if  when the Republican wet dream comes to pass* and all the wealth of the world is finally concentrated back into the hands of the ruling class. It has been a distressing number of decades when, ugh, practically anyone was allowed a decent living. Ah, but soon the world will be set aright again, the privileged few will once again be the few, and the rest of us?... why we can go fuck ourselves, as is our wont.  But there actually was a book I read some years ago which explored this theme to its bleakest extreme. I can't remember the title. It was a summer read, a book I picked up from the library mostly based on the cover art, and it was set in a post-scarcity world of the 22nd century. Robotics and cloning had made sure that no one ever really completely starved to death, but the surfeit of available labor, and the lack of jobs requiring skills, made sure that no one but a favored few would have anything close to a fulfilling and dignified existence.Then, of course, there were the hyper-rich. The trend towards increasing wealth concentration (1970: the top 1% of the US population taking in 9% of the nation's income to 2007: top 1% taking 23.5% of the income  to 2030: 1% grabbing 99%...) continues. The novel explored the interesting condition where, by  2097 or thereabouts, some dozen people controlled 99.999% of the world's wealth. And those dozen people, having acquired the lower 99.9999% share of the pie, their greed insatiable, proceeded to divest the upper 1%, and then the upper .01%, etc. of their wealth in a cannibalistic feeding frenzy of truly artistocratic proportions.You can imagine the stinking black venom of fear, the sickly swamp glow of jealousy, the scintillating pulses of purple paranoia, the oily psychoses, the razor pathologies, all pulsing and throbbing through the demented intellects of those twisted, fucked-up souls populating the increasingly small top of the food chain. What a fucking nightmare that book was.Ah, the very flower of humanity.*Really, read the link. Looking so fucking prophetic now. Krugman nails it. A manufactured fiscal crisis via the Bush tax cuts, so that current 2011 Republicans can point to a massive deficit, which they caused, in order to deprive, defund, dismantle the assets of federal and public institutions, and sell them to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, all public means of assistance to promote the general welfare shall be privatized, meaning you are fucked pay double: once to corporate providers of shoddy assistance and rickety social safety nets, and  again through past payments to public funds now in the hands of your corporate overlords. AND! AND!  They get the tiny-brained Tea Party tards to fuck themselves up the asshole with no lubrication by accepting austerity and thinking it was their idea. Fucking A!In short, the corporations won, and the current fiscal crisis was manufactured just to clean up the chump change. Welcome to the Age of Neo-feudalism.What say you? About ready to sharpen up those guillotine blades?"},
{"title": "The Tragedy of the Commons", "date": "Thursday, June 2, 2011", "text": "The other day I saw a piece of crap panel van with the bumper sticker \"Go Galt\" on it. All I could think of was \"Please, yes, stupid motherfucker, Go Galt, the quicker the better, go hide in your fucking hole in the mountains, so that we can be rid of your incompetent services, and someone better than you can do your job a lot better than you ever could, you fucking moron\".I honestly don't understand how these snaggletooth dipshits can consider themselves indispensable. I just wish they would find out soon, by running away, how fucking replaceable their studid fucking asses are.Garrett Hardin wrote the Tragedy of the Commons in 1968. The essay is basically a Malthusian-tinged plea against the continued despoliation of the planet, the continued exploitation and extraction of every available resource for human need and greed until the world is scraped clean down to bedrock. Clearly, the essay has been ineffective.Over time, the essay has since been mangled, manipulated, and mutilated to fit as supporting evidence for various political and economic agendas. The most egregious argument typically comes from  the free market capitalists, most stridently from the seriously fucked-in-the-head libertarian arm of the free market fundamentalist cult. They will present the argument as against communism. I find this distasteful. Not that I have any strong love for communism, I don't. I just find the idea of a fucking lie as distasteful. Which, of course is what the libertarian argument is - a fucking lie. Ignoring the fact that the argument contained in the essay is against a libertarian way of life (rationally self-interested individuals seeking to maximize personal happiness through private wealth creation) is easy for libertarians to do - considering their ability to ignore every single shred of empirical evidence stacked up like a fucking Japanese tsunami against the shabby rickety seawall of their political philosophy. But then, living in denial is easy to do when you consider that the idea that being a selfish inconsiderate asshole is a virtuous and laudable thing.But really, the argument is thus. Take a meadow open to all in a village for grazing sheep. Each shepherd wishes to graze the most sheep, so he can grow the most mutton and wool, and thus maximize his profits. this is a rational thing to do. But, all the shepherds acting as rationally self-interested individuals, grazing as many sheep as possible, quickly destroy the meadow. Too many sheep eat all the grass. A rational individual course of action has yielded an irrational destruction of property for all.The libertarians argue that, had the meadow been parceled into plots of private property, the tragedy would never have occurred. (Ignore the fact that there is no reason for a shepherd to despoil his own private property in pursuit of maximum profit - as happens so frequently in real life). They ignore the fact that, out in the real world, where these types of things occur all the time, individuals will band into communities, work out a common solution,  regulate themselves and others with a social contract or agreement, and so the tragedy does not occur. (They choose to ignore this because there is just too much of the C-word going on here - common, commune, community).The other aspect that is ignored is that, even though this is an open resource, the ownership that causes the tragedy is not one of common \"property\" (the grass), but of private property (the sheep). Again, there are plenty of examples where, through the unrestricted operation of individual action, a common resource becomes depleted - oil fields, fishing grounds, aquifers. In other words, without some type fo communal ownership, the private actions, unfettered and unrestricted, result in tragedy.Take, for example, Sainik Farms, an \"unrecognized\" neighborhood within the city limits of Delhi, in India. This once illegal settlement, now surrounded by metropolitan Delhi, must make do without city services. The residents themselves must provide their own electricity, garbage collection, lighting, water supply, etc.At one time, each individual homeowner drew their water from private wells. But over time, with so many wells drawing water, the aquifer had drawn  down. Each  home owner, competing with all others, was forced to drill deeper and deeper wells, until finally, no water could be drawn at all from any well.(A similar thing happened in Texas at the beginning of the last century in the oil fields. A forest of oil derricks sent the pressure of the oil field down to zero, and no oil could be extracted).This is an exactly equivalent situation with Hardin's. \"And you see?\", say the dumb-as-shit libertarians, \"this is why communism won't work. The shared resource cannot be managed well. Had the water been owned by each individual, and parceled up privately, there would have been no problems!\"But the water ownership was not the issue, just as grass ownership is not the issue in Hardin's argument. The well ownership is the issue. Those were privately held, privately owned, on private property. Each well - unmetered, unbilled, unmonitored, taking as much water as it can, without regard to the needs of any other property owner or the health of the aquifer - is a monument to unfettered capitalism. It's winner take all, every man for himself, I am the biggest selfish asshole and Fuck You if you don't like it, raw, free, unfettered, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness capitalism. And that's what you get from that. The destruction of an aquifer.Fortunately, the residents of Sainik Farms were not libertarians, were not selfish assholes. They realized that the solution to the problem was something that all of them together had to work out.The solution was twofold. First, operating with a group called FORCE (Forum for Organized Resource Conservation and Enhancement) they set about replenishing the aquifer through rainwater harvesting. The overabundance of the heavy monsoon rains, which caused a great deal of flooding, was collected, filtered, and pumped down the dry bore wells to restock the aquifer. Talk about a win/win!Second, the residents gave up most of their private wells, and have moved to a system of twenty community wells, with distribution pipes and monthly fees. By abandoning the policy of selfishness, by changing the attitude from one of being a selfish asshole individual with entitlements, to a member of a community with obligations and responsibilities to other members, the residents of Sainik Farms now have water. Better water. Cleaner water. Water all the time, for everyone.This is a lesson your average infantile libertarian (nee Republican) just isn't going to get, and perhaps we should just slag them off and let them go fend for themselves, as they threaten to do with bumper stickers.I give 'em a month. Then it's all rampant homosexuality and cannibalism."},
{"title": "Network Theory", "date": "Thursday, May 26, 2011", "text": "I've been finally noticing the blogger stats option, and in particular, the traffic sources. Who do I know in Iran? Nigeria? Sri Lanka?Lotka-Volterra EquationsFunny how the brain works. We magically assume certain associations, not realizing it's not about us, is it? It's about the network. It's not the nodes, it's the loops.Hey, speaking of which, did I ever tell you how I started out in college going for an art degree and came out the other end with a math degree? And how I almost used it? You see, back in 1977, I took a course in mathematical models. I had taken a calculus class, and had found it fun and easy, so I decided to try some other courses. Intro to Mathematical models was loosely tied to another course in computer simulations, using FORTRAN. By coincidence, I was also taking an Intro to FORTRAN class as well.Just so you have a flavor of the times, the computer facility was still using punch cards. You'd sit at a gigantic console, and type in commands on these chunky indestructible keyboards, and meanwhile a bunch of little holes would be punched out on a thick paycheck sized cardboard card. And when you had typed out your program on the cards, you would hand those through a slot in a glassed-in booth to an operator wearing a white lab coat.Yes, a fucking white lab coat.And so, you'd hand your shoebox full of cards over like a supplicant to a high priest. (I can remember one time a kid tripped and his shoebox full of punch cards spilled all over the floor. He started crying. To my credit, I helped him scoop up the cards before they were trampled). And then about a half hour later, they would stuff a printout into a mail slot with your results, which were usually not program output, but a list of programming errors you had committed. And so, this bullshit went on for several hours until you finally got a result.Then one day they installed big boxy terminals in the basement of the math and physics building, and you didn't need to deal with the snob dickheads at the computer center. So, I would get all stoked up on dope, and visit the basement to code in front of an amber screen through the wee hours of the morning. The only other people there would be dorks playing a game of StarTrek or early primitive role playing games.Anyway, one of the simulations that I got sucked into was predator/prey simulations which were first worked out in a simple version called the Lotka-Volterra equations. This LV model is also called the Foxes and Rabbits Game.  And basically what's going down here is that you have two main parameters used to determine the population numbers of foxes and rabbits. Obviously, the two numbers are linked to each other, and the parameters are reproduction rate of predators and prey versus destruction rate of prey by predators. It is a system of nonlinear equations, and these are notoriously difficult to find a general solution to. The trick is (and in math and science circles \"trick\" means a clever hack, not a trick as in trying to cheat) that if you can simplify some terms so that the nonlinear equation becomes linear, why, then, it is easy as pie to find a solution. Problem is, you typically take all the reality out of your simulation by doung so, and it ends up being a toy.The LV model doesn't even come close to reflecting real life numbers, but it is, after all, only the simplest modelling. Once not included would be the carrying capacity of the environment, in other words, the recognition that lots of rabbits will be self-limiting, once they eat all the grass. So, having foxes prey upon the rabbits helps out the grass, and allows more rabbits. So you would expect a cycle, but not to the extreme seen in the LV equations. It was fairly easy to plug and play the equations into the computer via FORTRAN, but after awhile I realized this was all just a circle jerk. Nowadays, we call this \"Chaos Theory\".I informed my professor of the situation, and his reply was quite snippy. \"Well, figure out a better way\" he sniffed.So, I created networks with agents. I doubt I pioneered this. (Actually, my simulation preceded Andrew Watson's and James James Lovelock's Daisyworld simulation by at least a decade, but I never published).But it just seemed an easier way to messy up the conditions without ending up with a really hideously complex set of equations. Local rules (the links and loops) affecting each agent (the nodes representing foxes and rabbits), all tied together by local conditions and rules. Kind of like John Conway's Game of Life, but with three levels of boardplay - one board being for the ground (grass, water, etc), one for the rabbits, and the top level for foxes. And the one thing I noticed right away was that the more inefficient the networks were, the closer the numbers looked to empirical results. In other words, the worse the transmission of data was on the links between nodes, the better the simulation played out.Inefficient networks played out. Why? Well, foxes don't always catch rabbits. Rabbits don't always get to eat grass at their leisure. Thus was my justification. But as it turns out, it seems that inefficient networks may be more efficient than efficient ones. So say the ants, at any rate.I ended up getting a C from snippy old Professor Poopbreath in the math models class. I didn't really care at that point. I had discovered von Neumann self-replicators by then, and had moved on to simulating robot farms.But that's another story."},
{"title": "Negrophilia?", "date": "Wednesday, May 25, 2011", "text": "I recently had a dream that I had a daughter. I am, in waking life, as far as I know, childless (unless you count the 30-40 kids I herd around at the college). In the dream, my daughter was perhaps 6-7 years of age. We play games. We cuddle. Exchange hugs. Read books. We tickle and tease one another.We do all the things fathers and daughters do. It is a wonderful dream. My daughter is healthy and beautiful. She is smart, funny, quick, bright, lithe, and really quite gorgeous. Just a gorgeous face on her.  You can tell she is going to be heartbreaker. She is also as black as coal.I would assume most progressively oriented people would prefer that I listed her attributes in just the order I did, or some variation, with the physical attributes and appearances last. Most of all the fact that she is extremely dark complected. Funny thing is, though, in the dream, it is the very last thing I notice.You know how dream logic is. Some portions which would normally be immediately noticed are either accepted as completely natural, or are suspended within the narrative, aspects put aside for later review. So it is with my daughter's skin color. It is a suspension of the dream narrative noticeable enough to wake me up. I think. I mean, I was so delighted with having such a wonderful daughter, her complexion was really hardly worth noticing.How post-racial of me. Ah, but no. Despite being raised by liberal parents, growing up in the town that I did, in the nation that I did, in the time period I'm from, I can't help but be racist. I am not, like most liberals, in denial about this. I have seriously fucked up prejudices. I'm working on that. And I've got to question if there is a white paternalism thing as well. She was my daughter, after all. Not my equal. Not my mate. My dependent.And, then there's the question of subconscious yearnings. Have I jungle fever? Negrophilia? Actually, I'm not certain about the word. It does have, given modern cultural associations, a haint to it. I keep thinking of \"Good Times\" episodes where Wilona would use the phrase \"Negro, please!\", and I can't see her meaning it in a good way. Maybe she was talking to Erik Rush.The first time I came across the word \"negrophilia\" was in a reading of how, before there was much in the way of constant contact, Europeans were negrophilic. I'm assuming they meant back in medieval or ancient times, but how this particular factoid is known in the book, I've quite forgotten. Perhaps it was an undocumented assertion. But why not? We've all of us a taste for the rare and exotic. Unless, of course, it was a misprint, and it should have been \"necrophilic\". I can see Europeans swinging that way, too."},

With the particular postures and gestures of the figures, what I once considered the awkwardness of rendering (they are a bit stiff and not quite proportional), I now consider helpful in that they reinforce the overall awkwardness and peculiarities of the piece.

The hollow forms have been welded together and the weld seams cleaned up, but there is still detail work to do. I'm fortunate in that the next two weeks will be kind of an Antarctic retreat.

Not quite sure why this happens this time of year. And, at the end of the two weeks, I'll be desperate for human companionship - chattering at anyone unfortunate to cross my path.In the meantime, it's cleaning up these figures. Chasing. Rough surfaces to smoothen. Filing and sanding. An appropriate patina must be put on. And then they'll be done, and I'll be in a strange place of having nothing to do, and no projects planned.This is the longest dry spell I've ever had. Going on three years. No new ideas.

{"title": "Privatize THIS!", "date": "Thursday, May 19, 2011", "text": "Two weeks ago I witnessed a scene which evoked contrasting emotions in me. Arriving at the strip mall Chinese restaurant for weekend lunch, there was a small crowd at the entrance. Closer examination revealed a hairy streetperson on the pavement, prostate, clutching his head, and writhing in pain. After examining the street guy, and determining that he was completely gassed up, three sheets to the wind, several hours into his weekend binge, and that he had lost his balance, had fallen over, hit his head, but was sitting up and looking for his beer, I decided he was OK, stepped over him, and so proceeded into the restaurant to order lunch.One woman with two small, filthy, and obviously miserable children in tow demanded that someone call 9-1-1. As far as I could determine, she had no relationship with drunken prostate street guy. Eventually, the possible munchausen-by-proxy woman (you'll just have to accept my opinion on this as I've no time to narrate her behavior to justify this statement, but suffice to say she was trying to milk as much attention from the unfortunate's situation as she could) called emergency services on her cellphone.Now, I don't know how it is in your town, but in Chicago, a 9-1-1 call for emergency medical assistance means that not only will an ambulance arrive, but the cops will also arrive as well. Drunken street guy knew this, and after lurching himself erect asked which way Belmont street was (presumably part of his route). Despite insistence from various onlookers that he remain seated for the ambulance, he made a steady and rapid recovery and took off toward Belmont street.Perhaps a minute, and certainly no more, after the busybody woman had made her call, a firetruck, which is to say a ladder truck, showed up in the parking lot of the strip mall. Fire personnel in full medical assistance regalia disembarked, and when told by members of the crowd that the emergency victim was high-tailing it up Belmont street, fanned out to find the bum. I saw nothing more as by then the takeout was done and I headed back to the studio.The conflicting emotions were as follows:Anger. Anger at the busybody woman who not enough sense to realize the bum was not incapacitated by injury, or rather, by voluntary behavior. Anger at the waste of public resources and tax monies. The public institution's response was a bit overzealous.Pride, and no small amount of amazement at the rapidity and capacity of the public assistance. Had this been a real emergency, it would have been handled deftly, expertly, with the utmost competence and, yes, style. I really don't see this type of outcome coming from private industry. I really don't.Think about it. \"Good enough for government work\" is an Orwellian piece of propaganda, an insult unworthy of the subject.If you want to see cheap, shoddy, crappy, inept products or services, look to the private sector.Can you imagine how that 9-1-1 call would have gone, if a private industry were in charge of emergency medical services? One clue as to the response on the phone, and it starts with \"Do you have any medical insurance?...\" No? =click= Government services - when properly funded - just beat the living crap out of private industry when it comes to quality. Social security checks, millions of them, go out on time and accurate every month. The people's socialist weather satellites and supercomputers do a pretty fantastic job at forecasting, especically during times of disaster. Remember Katrina? The National Weather Service pretty much predicted the track of that storm down almost in terms of feet. Speaking of accuracy how about NASA's space probes? Think they are good enough for government work? Think Fedex could do as well? Fedex wishes they had their shit together the way the command-and-control economies of the US government does. (And what is a private corporation but a little private command-and-control economy? When it's run right that is).The big lie which is gaining traction these past three decades can be summed up as the religion of free market fundamentalism, as the triumphalism of the neoliberal cult (although the past ten years haven't given them much to be triumphant about. You've two tenets in this current cult of privatization. One I've mentioned: market fundamentalism, the belief that most problems can be solved by the private parties rather than state oversight. The implicit assumptions in this belief is that markets, or competitive industries within a market, are rational and efficient. Empirical data to date denies this. Markets are not efficient. Actually, they are, but only when incorrect pricing is resolved, and the market \"suffers a correction\". The only time a market is efficient is during a crash. And competition? Well, the point of competition is to eliminate the competition. Once the competition is eliminated, there's no point in pursuing efficiency is there?The second tenet is techno fundamentalism: the optimistic belief that technology can solve all problems (especially the ones created by the technology to begin with).Together, this creates the religion of neoliberalism, which goes beyond your usual simpleton's libertarianism. Championed by Reagan and Thatcher, mastered by Clinton and Blair, taken on fiath by Bush, Cheney, and a Republican Congress, thirty years of it has nearly driven us all to ruin, or rather, those of us not in the top .1 percent. And, of course, the beautiful thing about this religion is it can be self-fulfilling in predicting a failure of public institutions to supply an essential public good. All you need do is defund the government, or better still, remove revenues in the form of taxes.For the private sector, it's a beautiful thing. Public projects are up for grabs, public infrastructures and institutions, built up over 400 years in the US of A, and worth tens of trillions, are now available to be cannibalized into obscene profits. And all you need do, to insure a public failure - the mirror image of market failure - is to cut the funding.  Beautiful. No need for public intervention. Not when it can all be privatized and at bargain basement prices (for them, not you). Like your society as it is? Enjoy the benefits of frivolous but beautiful things like public libraries, public art, public parks, folk festivals, opera, museums, free concerts, free anything? Do you seriously think you'll get any of this from private corporations, if they have a monopoly on everything,  have no fear of public oversight and intervention, and, quite simply have no incentive to provide for the public good, or, more likely, prevent public harm? Private corporations that generally treat the public as a resource to extract time, talent, information, and energy from? The record to date is, in general, pretty fucking abysmal. We are just human resources to them.  We are the raw material for the extractive industries around us, the latest being the \"social\" ones.So, with the current fad being to privatize everything that isn't nailed down, maybe it's time to tell the fucking corporate leeches and their public stooges to privatize THIS!"},

Or, if Obama was a she, some big giant ovaries.I mean, all that jowl-shaking, turkey-wattle, war-wimp pufferfish talk about how Reagan was The Man... Obama puts Reagan's soggy, half-inflated, crumpled-up, watery old ball sack in perspective. It makes the coming 2012 candidates coming from the right look like so many shit-covered flies buzzing around a wet smelly little turd called the Republican party.And then, to pound a few nails into the soft cheese-filled skull of the foul, rancid puss-filled D-bag Trump is just, wow, almost an imperial afterthought. Let's face it, fucking Trump's got a ratty old vermin-infested cum-stained mattress where his soul should be, and he was put down the way he should be with all his vile racist shit posing as curious inquiry. Obama's casual flick of the finger, banishing that rich (poor) white trash putz into an orbit beyond Pluto was Classic! Classic!The Pakistan raid was a huge political gamble, and we need to recognize, as in any risk-taking activity, that the negative outcome vastly outweighs the payoff. Had things gone south (*cough* Desert One Carter *cough*), as they could have in ten thousand horrible ways, that would have been the end of the Obama presidency. Further, in fact, the end of any person of a color darker than, say, bone white ever having any kind of position within our primate power structures.For good or ill, that bold act all on its lonesome got my vote come November 2012.But that's not what I want to talk about.Today, walking around campus, I smelled the smell of Spring in the air.  Spring, hopefully, after this rather over-worked and elaborate finding of keys to unlock Winter over the past two months, is finally here. And I experienced a powerful memory smell association with the smells of Spring. A smell memory as fine as a rich cup of coffee, with all the musical metaphors that accompany such a smell. The earthy bass line, the rich nutty melody, the dense sweet fruity harmonic companionship. Or is the melody fruity? Who fucking cares.I had a vivid memory of going down to Hannah's Nursery with my father. It invaded my consciousness like the Russian Army. It's a wonderful memory, accompanied by the feel and sight of warm sunlight in a greenhouse enclosure. I've always felt greenhouses, like libraries, are the first and best examples of human civilization. In a way, greenhouses are libraries, but with plants for books. Anyway, it's a good memory and I will savor it as much as I can.But that's not what I want to talk about.Charlie Stross recently expressed a dark fantasy involving the utter annihilation of the Royal Family of England. Or Great Britain. Or the United Kingdom.  Whatever.  It's all just idle speculation, I'm sure. Just a spot o' fun to play with. Also, probably partially Charlie crowd-sourcing for ideas, fishing about for interesting contingencies. A partial reading of his commenter's thoughts basically devolved to line of succession and King Ralph scenarios.But it got me to thinking... Charlie's instrument of destruction is a meteor strike. Specifically, Charlie says:\"The devastating explosion that ripped through Westminster Abbey less than an hour ago is confirmed to be a meteorite. The 10 meter object was tracked on radar by National Air Traffic Service (NATS) prior to impact. According to Project Spaceguard it was considered to be of low significance, Official sources say terrorism is not involved.\"  The wedding party is very accurately wiped out by this celestial object. But really now, given our species tendencies towards misinterpreting events, and reading significance into random accident, and intent into unfortunate coincidence, what exactly are the chances of some type of conspiracy theory developing around this 10 ton object from Outer Space? Hands? Anyone?Fucking A right there's gonna be a conspiracy theory! A meteorite that only takes out the Royal Family and the British government? Which makes me wonder just how large the  smoking hole has to be before it moves from human agency to act of God. Just how large the object has to be. The interesting thing here is that it is similar to problems in music and art. In visual art, it would be a matter of scale impacting the viewer. The equivalent of scale in music would be some combination of tempo or volume, I suppose. But the interesting thing here is how the continuous range of a parameter (meteorite heft and size, scale of a sculpture, etc.) results in an abrupt and discontinuous change in perception or behavior.In math, this is called an inflection point. In dumbed-down middlebrow-speak, the term is \"tipping point\". The interesting thing is, is there an exact, precise inflection point? Or a range? Since we are dealing with human psychology, I'd go with range.A meteorite that takes out Westminster Abbey versus, say, the structure and five hundred yards out, so that a substantial part of the commoner crowd dies as well, turns the catastrophe into a chance event. But two hundred yards, fifty? How large a crowd has to die to kill off the conspiracy theory? Probably a term paper in this somewhere...I probably think out things like these more than is necessary."},

The American economic hegemony will have lasted a mere (counting from Brenton Woods) 72 years. Whether the prediction holds true or not really doesn't matter. Nothing lasts.Some would say this should really put things in perspective for American politicians. While Congress engages in short-sighted squabbling over which shall party shall be in power, the rest of the world has decided that the answer is inevitably \"Neither. You both suck.\"And just as well, as it puts statements by such reptilian creatures as Mitch McConnell, who's one stated and dearest wish is to see Barack Obama \"to be a one-term president\" in the proper light. Such a lofty, far-sighted, world-shaking vision! The old fuck really knows how to shake the pillars of Heaven. No wonder so many people have prophesied the decline of the American empire, given the fact that it's only apparent goal is the same as that of the lowly bacterium - a narcissistic and self-absorbed desire for things to continue just as they are. Given a possible cultural trend in America towards narcissism, is it any wonder that libertarians are ascendant? And that, quite possibly, the American behemoth is already in decease, and libertarians merely the inevitable outbreak of anaerobic microbes - happily ready to feast on its soon-to-be bloated corpse?Ah, but that's actually not my worry at the moment. Times like these do make me look at things witha long term perspective, and my current worry is... are we just a simulation?No really, are we all just a computer program running on some vast supercomputer at the end of time? How could we tell?I may have an answer to this.Computer programs that model things will typically try and save on processor space and time. Cutting corners usually involves not quite simulating everything so exactly. Better to be digital than analog. Better to pixelate than process a continuity/ And funnily enough, according to quantum mechanics, the universe is digital. Everything is broken up into discrete little bits: space, time, energy, you name it.That's what Plank's constant is all about. It's the number of the bottom. You can look at things down to a level of smallness, and then you hit a wall. That's it. No smaller. Little pieces of time, or space, or area,  distance, or volume smaller than the metric  multiplied by Plank's constant simply do not exist. That is the smallest level of pixelation.And Plank's constant is designated as h. Little h. And little h is a really tiny number, specifically 6.6262 x 10-27 erg seconds. That's the decimal number .00000000000000000000000000066262.And hbar over 2, like show in the figure above, is just h divided by 2 time pi, and is usually treated as a standard deviation.So, if it turns out that equations such as the uncertainty principle listed above behave themselves, and a universe in turn behaves similarly with a value for h much, much larger than a value of 6.6262 x 10-27 erg seconds, then we can all breathe a little easier about not living in a simulation. Quite simply because your average dumbass programmer (and your average programmer is, sorry to say, a dumbass) running a standard Monte Carlo simulation will use the largest smallest number he can to run the simulation....unless the Great Designer accounts for this, and programs the simulation for larger values of h accordingly..."},

It all makes so much sense!And so it is with so many systems of knowledge. Presented much as lawyers present their case. Seems all logical, just so long as you don't examine the assumptions too carefully. Ah, but once you do, it just all falls apart and is revealed for what it is. Superstition. Magical thinking. Voodoo.Poor old James Gleick. I've read and enjoyed a lot of his books. Chaos: Making A New Science. Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman. And now he has a new book out. Information: A History, A theory, A Flood.I'm sure it is an interesting book, covering the works of such notables as Charles Babbage, Ada Byron, Claude Shannon, Norbert Weiner. Unfortunately, at least from this excerpt, it appears that Gleick has also been suckered into the cult of memetics.How sad. To buy into the Just-So Stories for Little Children of Richard Dawkins. Dawkins makes a glib and vague comparison between stories, tunes, poems, images, tools, and inventions and his fundamentalist conception of genes. All of a sudden everyone is a robot ape, their empty little animal brains filled with a fiction called memes.I really am amazed at how many otherwise perceptive and intelligent people have bought into this bullshit. But then, the same can be said for social darwinism, libertarianism, objectivism, marxism, all the other isms that sound good on paper, but never, ever work out in the real world - when confronted with real data.And perhaps that is the only valid field of study for memes: lies, fictions, falsehoods, fraud, false attributions, misapprehensions about the world. Internet memes, requiring only the empty task of a brainless, mindless, stupidly repetition, seems the only true version of meme. These seem to be the only concept in which it applies. Primarily because, flying against all available contradictory data and god taste, these things manage to continue.Of course, the world of ideas, both abstract concepts and concrete technology, is much more complicated than Dawkin's simplistic notions. I'm sure his stodgy old mind would love that all that messy data which is human culture could be jammed into the much more managable subset of biology. But then, one should be able to continue the process, and stuff biology into chemsistry, and thence into phsyics, and thus, ultimately, all of the silly little complications of being human can be traced back to the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and we are done.Of course, we must ignore that the typical human behavior is not mimicry, but recreation. We must ignore the fact that the human brain - unlike a computer which is very, very good at copying - really pretty much sucks at reproducing things with any kind of fidelity. Human memory, animal memory just doesn't work that way. Which makes the idea of process of replication with modification as how brains work, wrong. Worse than wrong. Not even wrong.And not because we have a hard time learning things (we do), but that we just can't stop messing with a good thing. You hear a joke, you make it your own. You see a design, you look for ways to improve it. There is a teleological aspect, a Lamarckian aspect, to human culture that a Darwinian fundamentalist like Dawkins would like very, very much to go away. But it won't. Quite simply, the concept of memes is completely stupid. Think about this for a second. How many memes does it take to complete the category for chair. Or for the act of sitting down. Way too many memes. And which meme in yoyur empty little animal brain is it that selects the fitness of all the other memes? And do ants have memes. Because they sure do seem to use them when engaging in categorical behaviors such as making war, making slaves, tending crops, and domesticating aphids. So memes predate human brains? Were memes floating about in the red hot Hadean atmosphere of Earth, just waiting for Life to get started?It's all just bullshit. It's magical thinking. It's unicorns... shitting... donuts."},
{"title": "When Mediocre Science Fiction Authors Go Bad", "date": "Wednesday, April 20, 2011", "text": "Or just plain confuse their constructed realities with real reality.And mediocre is being kind. \"Bad\" is a better descriptor, in that the generated prose is fucking awful, the characters two dimensional and wooden, the dialogue stilted and stiff, the plots melodramatic and infantile, the entire work generally boring, thus resulting in an extremely clumsy and painfully embarrassing to watch episode of public masturbation. Some culprits: L Ron HubbardJane RobertsAyn RandRichard DawkinsThe first name is fairly obvious. L Ron Hubbard, creator of Scientology, made a drunken bet that he could turn his fictional works into a cult. I'd say he won it. Nothing more need be said of this piece of shit.Jane Roberts, probably one of the better examples of the TV Trope known as \"Mary Sue\". Her Seth character, supposedly a highly evolved fifth dimensional being, is quite possibly one of the most patronizing creations in literature. Jane never attained much of a cult status, certainly not any Jim Jones stature, but she did do a fair amount of harm by trivializing suffering by blaming the victim. The idea that \"souls\" consented to their life experiences is about as horrible an idea as justifying the mistreatment of the congenitally deformed because they are atoning for the sins of a past life.I include Ayn Rand as an author of science fiction only because many of her dystopian works were set in the future, although she could just as easily be filed under fantasy. Her foolish bombastic pronouncements certainly managed to ignore the entirety of empirical evidence regarding the human condition. Anarchists and libertarians, working from similar faith-based and completely fucked-in-the-head premises, are continually able to, for lack of a better example,   imagine that their pet unicorns shit donuts (which explains the horns, you see, for collecting donuts when you have a unicorn train in single file parading in your fornt yard just for you!).  The less said about this awful old bitch, the better, save that she had no fucking clue whatsoever about altruism. Which leads me to the last name on  the list.Richard Dawkins. Strange to call him a science fiction author, but I'll explain in a minute. Most people are not aware of him, but if they are, it is usually for his role as abrasive activist for atheism. I personally consider him an asshole, and think that, with his hectoring prose style and my-way-or-the-highway interpretation of genetics and natural selection, has probably done more harm than good in promoting evolution and atheism. With his imperious pronouncements about right and wrong thinking, he comes across more as a priest or a lawyer than a scientist. But that's not the worst he has done. Starting with The Selfish Gene (now woefully out-of-date), he has created the cult of memetics. Memetics is a (charitably) pseudoscientific discipline devoted the the study of memes.And memes? Memes are a Dawkins Delusion.They are pet unicorns that shit donuts. They are untestable hogwash. And have been for some thirty odd years.This has not stopped people from theorizing about them, like poor old Susan Blackmore. In fact, Blackmore has created variants, such as temes, that, like different colored kinds of Kryptonite don't so much explain human culture very well as rationalize away any and all obvious contradictory complications.Human history is littered with convenient fictions. The vital principle, the luminiferous aether, the phlogiston, epicycles and the Ptolemaic or geocentric model of the solar system, animal magnetism, memes.The luminiferous aether was posited to explain how light waves could travel through space. They were disproven by Michaelson and Morley in an experiment measuring the speed of light.Phlogiston, the element of fire, was proposed by Johann Becker, championed and then rejected by Joseph Priestley, and probably first disproven by Robert Hooke.Epicycles, the idea that the planets circle around points of empty space along their orbits, were necessary to account for the deficiencies of the geocentric model of the solar system. Once Copernicus  put the sun at the center, they were no longer needed. Space travel, to this day, disproves them constantly.The vital principle, animal magnetism, memes? Unscientific. Hard to disprove the existence of something that does not exist, because, quite simply, an experiment will provide no empirical evidence pro or con. As such, for me, they occupy the realm of philosophy and metaphysics. Waste of time.Just another cult. We've enough of them already."},
{"title": "The All Too Brief Stellar Age", "date": "Monday, April 18, 2011", "text": "Perhaps seven years ago or so, I attended Art Chicago, which had just moved to the Merchandise Mart after the previous promoter had gone bankrupt. Most of the works there were paintings, and I remember one particular work quite vividly to this day.It was a dark, sparse landscape, not quite melodramatic, but tending towards. The time was twilight, and so the horizon was a splash of gold and red. In the foreground, seated in a fairly ornate chair was a very large and rotund man in formal dress eating a cake. He rather looks like Sydney Greenstreet. He holds the cake on a plate with one hand, and a fork in the other.He's very busy at the cake. His attention unwavering and fully focused upon the act of consumption, and it appears from the look of concentration upon his face, that he is not necessarily enjoying the cake, so much as intent upon devouring it.Standing beside him is a waiter holding another cake. The waiter is also dressed foramlly, and in fact the garb of everyone in the painting suggests the style of, say, the 1920s or 1930s. Beside the waiter holding the cake is still another waiter, also with a cake. And actually there is a whole sinuous snake dance of waiters with cakes walking zigzaggedly back and forth backwards into the horizon. A possibly infinite number of waiters with cakes are suggested from this, although, thankfully, not done as a vanishing line of waiters.In the foreground, next to the cake-devouring large and in charge character is another waiter, although by his posture he suggests he is possibly a maitre d or butler. He leans forward with concern as another waiter cups his hand and whispers in his ear. The whispering waiter has a disconcerted look upon his face.The whole scene done in the kind of improbable lighting that Rembrandt enjoyed using, as though the electric arc lamp had been invented some two hundred years earlier than expected.I really enjoyed that painting, and, had I happened to have five grand of walking around monies, would have have purchased it. That's how much I liked it.I happened to be at Art Chicago chaperoning the scuplture class from Harper College. I was, for some reason, temporarily paired with a student who's name now escapes, but who I do remember as being about 80% studied affectations, 15% random mimicry, and the remainder some rudimentary personality. Fidgeting about, he asked me what I thought of the painting. Rather than tell him what I thought, I told him what it suggested to me.\"The big guy eating the cake is God. God is devouring cake because it takes a lot of energy to keep the universe going, to keep existence propped up. As you can see, there are an infinite number of waiters ready to present Him with cakes. If you wish, the waiters are angels. They don't have to be, but it fits with my narrative. The worried waiter/angel with hand cupped to the maitre d/archangel ear is whispering:'We are out of cake!'\"An elderly, well-dressed, and obviously well-to-do woman standing next to me with her husband beamed at me.\"Oh, I like this painting now!\" she said.I don't know if the couple bought the painting. And I'm not particularly sure what the point of this particular screed was. It just popped into my head just now. Funny how that goes, huh?"},

But Rand Paul has been busy since then, so his buffoonery finally caught my attention.Whether it is starring on John Stossel's show advocating the flat tax (hint which could apply to Paul Ryan as well:  buffing up Steve Forbes' smelly old turd will not put a shine on it), to threatening to filibuster the budget compromise, then deciding against that behavior as it might make him seem to be a petulant dipshit, to quoting from the Holy Book of Rand (Ayn Rand) during Senate hearings, (and yes, Randian Libertarianism and Objectivism are cults), to planning on attending a Tea Party rally against taxes in Bowling Green, Rand Paul never fails to put his foot in his mouth - after stepping into a big steaming pile of ideology. I know it is too easy to make fun of him but, I just can't resist.So check out this amazingly silly toilet tirade of his from a month ago:At around 48 seconds in where you get the good stuff. Rand's floaters just can't make it down the toilet. They just sit there in the bowl. Frankly, his toilets don't work and he blames the US government for that. Check out the woman behind him trying not to laugh.I mean, let's just ignore the whole weird fucking interrogation about whether the Assistant Secretary of Energy is pro-choice or not, and whether the killing of fetuses somehow affects his toilet or light bulb performance (and yes, I get where he is trying to go with his fucked up logic), the fact of the matter is, Rand, there's this lever on the tank that you  have to pull. That makes water come out of the tank and flushes that shit right down the sewer.I realize indoor plumbing is a new-fangled \"notion\" to you, but progress, Rand, progress. The idea that modern hygiene and sanitary conditions somehow restrict your choices is not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, I'd love to exercise my free choice to take a shit on your porch or in the driver's seat of your car, but see? Restricting unlimited choices is not always a bad thing.And keep the pots and pans in the in the kitchen where they belong, not under the bed for your \"night soil\". Fucking hick."},

I've read a lot of those... classy books you are supposed to read. I've eaten my intellectual veggies. I'm entitled to some empty calories every now and again.Some of the best trash TV are the commercials. Recently, there is one on for a product called Colon Cleanse. Me, I'd have endeavored to come up with a better name, but I suppose they want the point to be plain and simple. Part of the charm of this commercial is a chart showing how much fecal matter you store depending on how often you have a bowel movement. If you go but once a day (according to the advertisers) you walking around with about 7 and a half pounds of excess fecal matter. BM every other day, 15 pounds, and so on! (Or maybe it was ounces, the point being, who is doing the comparison measurements here? Or wants to? Are there people who get excited over determining if you have excess fecal matter? I think there are! I think the Colon Cleanse people found just the resource they needed for that nifty chart!)The rest of the commercial? Well, I don't care. As long as you eat fairly well, get in some moderate exercise, drink enough water, leave your colon alone. Believe me, not only does your colon know what it is doing, it knows better than you do how you are doing.But I would suggest that they amend the commercial to present a colon cleanse challenge, like the laundry and dish detergent commercials used to do.And actually, given the recent rustlings, hissings, and scratching of claws on glass that is coming from the reptile cage known as the political right, perhaps that is what all the fuss is about.Paul Ryan recently released his \"GOP Path to Prosperity\" budget plan. Given the events of the past decade, I'd say there are some among the rigidly autocratic right that have a sense of humor. Oh, wait, he's serious? Never mind.Aside from the dismantling of Medicaid and Medicare to pay for even more tax cuts for the rich, the plan calls for entry into fantasyland. Somehow, by 2040 or so, there will be a budget surplus, which will make our robot overlords very happy. And everyone will have a job at the Soylent Green plant.Yeah, OK, there are plenty news articles out there explaining how ludicrous Paul Ryan's budget plan is. It's just completely unrealistic. So why did he do it? Knowing that it was all horseshit, why pull this type of empty political stunt? To get our minds off the looming budget crisis and government shutdown?  Truth to tell, no one outside of Washington or the media coverage really gives a shit about that until it happens. Is it, as David Frum suggests, merely the Republican Party talking to itself?\"Note to self. Fuck over the poor and the middle class and give any remaining monies over to the rich. Uh. Oh! Did I say that out loud?\"I don't think so. I don't think they need a memo point to remind America how severe of an incompetently fucked up fuckups they are.Here's my theory. I think that Paul Ryan, an admitted Ayn Rand worshipper, may just be getting some hints that, as all Ayn Rand worshippers are, he is so seriously full of shit that he may possibly be beyond even surgical intervention. And so Ryan is, very publicly, taking the Colon Cleanse Challenge!What say folks, is Ryan carrying perhaps a bit too much excess fecal matter around?Stay tuned. Same Bat Time! Same Bat Channel!"},

No five second rule for me.I've always had only a mild version of aversion to getting dirty. Being raised in the country helped some (with \"healthy\" dirt). My 9th grade biology teacher gave me a book to read which helped. It was called \"Life on Man\" by  Theodore Rosebury.So I realize that we are surrounded and suffused by a halo of poop and poop related germs. Literally. If the aliens come, they will either wrinkle their noses (if they have them) in disgust, or bury them in our crotches and armpits in a complete and orgiastic scent symphony...\"How do you do? Welcome to Earth! We- oh! Oh! Ah-ha-ha! Hello there!\"I suspect the latter. I've a feeling that part of Life making it through the Great Filter to expand and explode out into the greater universe is a very high gross-out factor. It's of good survival value. I also believe that any life we meet out there will have solved the problem of survival the way life did on Earth: through consortia. By cooperating, by living together, by living on, within, among, amidst, entangled, embraced, entwined, enamored, encircled, encysted. Swapping and sharing bodily fluids of every type and description. Eww. Icky. Icky. Eww. Eww-eww-ick.But Get Fucking Over It. It's almost an inevitable result of the known laws of physics.Of course, we Americans have this pathological tendency to rid ourselves of our little passengers. Which is why we stink so badly when we do not bathe. We exude natural substances. Not sweat. Not eccrine sweat.  Eccrine sweat is mostly water,  with some  edible elements for bacteria, for the mild locker room smell. Skin flakes are good, and grease, and sebum. Apocrine sweat, though, that's the good stuff. The apocrine glands, located in the armpits, crotch, and feet, exude a cloudy protein secretion which is bacterial manna from heaven. The bacterial breakdown products are the thing that provides that powerful Body Order Blast.   (3-methyl-2-hexanoic acid and androstenone being the major players).Not to mention that stinky cheese smell from the feet. L brevis, a foot bacteria, is also used as an inocculant to make strong cheeses. Parmesan, anyone?Makes you wonder, doesn't it? Why our bodies would produce substances that basically attract stinky bacteria like flowers do bees? Could it be to set up a relatively benign ecosystem, a robust biome that prevents really nasty bacteria from getting a toehold? Yeah, I thought so too. Cooperation going on there.But we Americans, programmed to be afraid of offending anyone with a smell, take personal hygiene to insane proportions. Fucking pathological, as in Almost German. As a result, I suspect that we wipe out the relatively benign (smelling) bacteria, and leave lots of room for those really virulently stinky motherfuckers. The ones who can digest the smallest crumb, the tiniest scrap of skin flake or seat protein. And as a result, we Americans, when we don't get an opportunity to bathe, really fucking stink up the place something awful.My personal anecdotal experience suggests this. When I was in \"primitive\" conditions among people who had a chance to bathe perhaps once a week, I found that, though they smelled a little, I stunk a lot. But after about a week, I stunk less. A healthy balance seemed to be occurring on my epidermis. It helps to be able to change your clothes. Clothing really sucks up a lot of skin oil, grease, sweat, dander, and filth. This probably explains why people in the Renaissance, who rarely if ever bathed, could stand each other.Regardless, the reason this came up was one of the little old ladies in the ceramics class here at the college just got back from a Sahara safari tour. Or should that be Sahel? Anyway, she started out from the west coast of Africa on a journey to Timbuktu.When she mentioned she was going through places like Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mali, my response - before I could catch myself - was \"Oh my god those places are all shitholes!\"Fortunately she took along lots of toilet paper and wet wipes. She mentioned that it was pretty rough. But the worst part of the trip was on one segment through the Sahara where no one on the bus could bathe for a few days. The bus started to smell pretty ripe. The natives manning the hotel recoiled at the stench of the tourists, but maintained a stoic courtesy.The little old lady brought me back a gift. A Dogon bronze. It looks like a guy pulling his pants up. I guess he's dancing. She mentioned that she got to see it cast. \"How'd they do it?\" I asked.(The old style method, going back to Ghana, perhaps, oh, before my ancestors learned about shit-free buttholes, was to mix up a slurry of clay and horsedung, cover the wax figure, dry it, and melt the wax out, pour the metal in).\"They used charcoal, clay, and camel dung. And they melted lots of bullet casings\".Ah. Probably for a hundredth the cost of what I do. And the technical virtuosity involved in the little Dogon figure is first rate. No defects.I got to find me some horse dung."},

I mean, aside from it being my current favorite phrase?I'm reading \"Packing For Mars\" by Mary Roach. You may have read her. She has previously written books like \"Stiff\", \"Spook\", and \"Bonk\". She is an enjoyable and informative read the same way Bill Bryson or John McPhee is.  The book is about what is it going to take to live in space. And by live, I mean just that. Living in space, as in more than just working. Living in space, as in eating, sleeping, bathing, and also, puking, peeing, shitting, and fucking.After reading the book, I would very much like to find the recipe for NASA synthetic space poop. Someone came up with a recipe for poop that closely resembles the item in both consistency, texture, viscosity, and color, but not smell. The eight-year-old that lives inside me desperately wants the recipe. Now, the reason the poop was developed was for the Space Shuttle's zero-G toilet, which is basically a shop vac with a butt-sized attachment. Everything that goes into space must be tested under similar conditions. Weightlessness is achieved by riding in parabolic flight in the infamous Vomit Comet. The freefall portion of the flight is only about 20 seconds, and though there are some people who can shit on command, most people have difficulty going number 2 in only twenty seconds before the plan has to climb again.\"Go! Go! Go!\"So, you come up with a poop delivery system, like a big toothpaste tube, and an appropriate delivery product, to do your test.The space toilet requires toilet training to learn, which may sound a bit of a stultifying thing for an adult to have to undergo, but I suspect the training is preferable to shitting into a baggie. Or a brown paper bag. Both of which I have done. But those are stories for another time. If ever.So... what's the deal with the prehensile penis?A trip to Mars could take up to five hundred days with primitive chemical rockets. Five hundred days. Five hundred days in zero G, with cosmic rays coursing through your body, and solar flares dousing you with X- and gamma rays, means you are pretty much an prematurely aged, decrepit invalid when you are ready to touch down. No thanks.I think we seriously need to rethink the whole point of going to Mars. I know there are some people who would go regardless of the risks. They are stupid. Honestly. If the whole point is to just plant a fucking flag, aren't there enough up there already? I'm divided on the manned space program issue, but the bottom line is this: if you don't go to with the goal of staying there (wherever) permanently, of committing ourselves to a permanent presence out there off planet, we are wasting our fucking time.Alright. Alright. The prehensile penis. Long story short, in the chapter on space sex, a fun little scientific fact is revealed. Male dolphins have a prehensile penis. Encounter groups have had to exclude certain frisky males who have grabbed people by the ankle, and dragged them about the lagoon. Well, I'm up for recombining my DNA for that particular enhancement. Only problem is, it's not quite true. Dolphins do not have a prehensile penis the way a monkey's tail is prehensile. It cannot wrap around and grab things. The male dolphin can manipulate his penis at the base, which allows him  to pick up objects and the like. Okay, so it is no monkey's tail, but good enough. I'll take it. Considering your average human male can, with the  BC and IC muscles, waggle the little guy around in a limited range, but it's not nearly as spectacular as some other denizens of the animal kingdom.  Now, you want to see a prehensile penis? Look to the elephant, old son."},

Considering I've only the unmodified software with no patches or instrument downloads or AU plug-ins to work with, the best I have come up with so far is the Dry Organ software instrument with the harmonic and cutoff steps options set to \"small\".Who fucking cares? Right?Well, I care, because tonight, Friday, March the 18th, will be the second annual opening recital for our mid-life crisis garage band. I'm as excited as a Norwegian can get, which is to say, for a cold people from a cold country, not very, or not outwardly. It's a terse, taciturn version of excitement. But I am excited. We will stay up to the wee hours of the morn, drinking and making bad music.I am the keyboardist/alternate percussionist/vocalist/sound effects member of the band. Those titles are, at the very least, a conceit, as I really don't play the piano, or the drums, or keep time very well. Though I don't have much of a voice, I can at least stay in tune, and make interesting noises. This is sufficient to provide an ambient atmosphere to the performance, at least until I am told to stop, which happens pretty frequently.But then again, our band is, quite awful. Really fucking terrible. So it really doesn't matter. One of these days, I'll set up something through a third party host for some of the tracks and then embed them here for your listening pleasure, and oh my, you will regret it.(I think I've mentioned previously the band is known as, ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages... The Motherfucking Cocksuckers! And yes, I know, not the best name for a rock-n'-roll band. When my brother and his best friend first organized the band in his detached garage a year ago, many names were bandied about. Somehow, as a joke, the MCs were thrown out there, and there it is. At the time, they were intent upon coming up with stage names for their personae, and all I could think of was \"So... are we gonna have a tree fort clubhouse too, and a secret password?\")According to my brother, last year we did 78 songs, which is to say we covered some 60 or so songs and created 10-12 originals. Those who have listened to the tapes agree that it is best listened to stoned, but rare favorable comparisons have been made to Spike Jones and Frank Zappa - in that we tend to do narrative pieces that are not very serious.Last fall, during one late night critical review of the tapes, involving philosophical discussion and beers, my brother and I laid down some new ground rules.We had kind of started out with one ground rule right from the start, borrowing from improv: Never Say No. If someone wants to do a cover, or wants to do something, whatever it is, we do it. The problem with this type of tolerant and creative magnanimity is that anarchy eventually favors the strongest personalities. Which is to say, upon review of the tapes, my brother and I agreed that a new ground rule is that the Kurman Brothers Really Need to Shut The Fuck Up.Listening to the tapes, there were far too many time when someone would start playing something cool, and the idiot oblivious Kurman boys just  stepped all over it with  some stupid comment or musical crap. So, we are to police each other tonight. We'll see how that works out.In the meantime, I'm back to finding that elusive high-pitched Martian space vibrato."},
{"title": "Wagers On Magical Creatures", "date": "Thursday, March 17, 2011", "text": "I wish, now, that I had devoted more of my time in college to academic pursuits. At least I come by it honestly. In Bloomington, Indiana there is an off campus area on 5th street which was filled with bars and taverns. I don't know what is there today. My father recounts that, during his time at IU right after WWII, on the day when the GI Bill checks arrived, the gutters on that street would be jam packed with passed out veterans the following morning. And he was one of them.Alcohol was never my particular weakness, although there is the usual Northern European genetic tendency towards that addiction floating around in my somatic consortium.  The more \"hep\" recreational drugs were my abuse of choice, and I regularly entertained that weakness. I now wish I had spent less time smoking dope and playing video games, but such regret is useless. Better to use the time I have now in worthwhile pursuits. I know that they say \"Youth is wasted on the wrong people\", but I also think that  youth is there to be wasted.   It's a period when we are invulnerable, infallible, and immortal, and so why not waste the time?Besides, it's not like we can go back in time and change the past, right?(Oh... shit, Kurman's gonna geek out on time travel again).No, actually. No, I'm not.Although the time travel thing reminds me of some thoughts I had on what it is we can and cannot know.If you want a word for that, it's called epistemology.I've always gone with the principle that all of our knowledge is provisional. Our facts are conditional, contextual, and contingent. This does not mean I subscribe to some kind of Leftist butthead postmodern relativism. Rather I will weight my facts on a gambling basis. Some facts that I will stand behind, and bet a billion gajillion dollars on. If I were to put odds on things, or as a percentage, I'd say anything beyond fifty percent I'd put a wager on, considering how many coin flip moments my extremely tenuous grasp on reality turns on.So, like what?Well, I'll bet that life exists somewhere else out there in the universe. I'll bet that it is fairly plentiful - at a bacterial level. Given that, I'll bet that intelligent life exists out there.  Given that, I'll bet it's pretty sparse. I'll bet, utilizing the Fermi Paradox, that we are the only intelligent life in this galaxy. I'll bet that our nearest inteligent neighbors are at least 100 million light years away. I'll bet that it is unlikely we are even remotely close technologically speaking. I'll bet that most intelligent life is millions, or even billions of years ahead of us. I'll bet that we really don't want them knowing about us, in the same way that mildew really shouldn't make it's presence known in your bathroom. I'll bet that there are immense and powerful forces out there that it is just as well they don't know about us.On the other hand, I'll bet that we share this planet with another intelligent species. I'll bet that none of the obvious candidates (dolphins, whales, elephants, etc. ) are one of these species. In fact, it is a favored creepy fantasy of mine that we are, in some kind of vampiric parasite manner, preyed upon by an unseen species. (But without the actual vampirism, more like elves or pixies stealing stuff). Why would I entertain this notion? Well, it's fun. It's a fun intellectual exercise, and it is sufficiently creepy. And, courtesy of Richard Hamming, it goes like this:  \"Just as there are odors that dogs can smell and we cannot, as well as sounds that dogs can hear and we cannot, so too there are wavelengths of light we cannot see and flavors we cannot taste. Why then, given our brains wired the way they are, does the remark \"Perhaps there are thoughts we cannot think,\" surprise you? Evolution, so far, may possibly have blocked us from being able to think in some directions; there could be unthinkable thoughts.\" And since these are, in a sense, blind spots, or holes in our minds, it seems only reasonable that evolution would come up with creatures that exploit the holes in our minds. There could be creatures on this planet that exist, but since it impossible for us to think about them, they are, in a very real sense, invisible to us. So, I'll bet they exist, but since there is no empirical way for us to prove that, I'll not wager to much on them. There are accidental ways to find out, but in a sense, this could be anecdotal, in a magical sense. Regardless, like I said, it's just fun. What else? Well, like, I'm 99% sure that I (me, my personality, my mind) will cease to exist when I die. I base this on the assumption of Landauer's Princicple: All Information is Material. (In other words, my definition of material, regardless of its esoterity, is that it exists). So, the only things that will remain of me will be fond memories of my friends and loved ones, the malicious glee of my rivals and enemies (if I have any, probably not, so then, maybe just a fleeting good riddance from those I have annoyed), and the other slightly more \"substantial\", less ephemeral, artifacts that remain, such as my art works, writings, stupid jokey songs.And, oh my, if it turns out the Internet is forever, or as forever as the universe allows, then, Far, Far Future, I sincerely apologize for wasting so much energy on my crap. But you know they say, youth is wasted on the young."},
{"title": "The Monster That Lives Under Japan's Bed", "date": "Tuesday, March 15, 2011", "text": "No, this is not an attempt to joke about Japan's situation. Despite the fact that I have kind of a generalized dislike for the Japanese people, my heart genuinely goes out to them and I wish their suffering to be kept to a minimum. (I honestly have no good explicable reasons for it, I just have the vague sense that they play at being a little too cute - trying to hide a long abiding savagery which certain unfortunates in the mid-20th century got to see firsthand). That sentiment may not sound like the most sympathetic or empathetic, but there you go. As a human being, operating under the default setting of benign indifference which I think holds for most human beings, I do wish them all well.I know the Japs have a renown for low budget monster movies. But what we see as cheesy, the Japanese see, probably subconsciously, as a real and ongoing threat. For the longest time, we in the US assumed those monster movies were about us. Yeah, us, the, you know, the fat, beefy, overly loud people who actually pounded the crap out of them with monstrous weapons some fifty years ago. But no, sorry to pop your bubble, but we were just an afterthought.The real monster under the bed is quite literally living under the bed of every man, woman, child in Japan. And this monster is real. Magnitude 9 real.I have no doubt that, big picture, long clock wise, they are going to get through this. They have that \"No surrender\" spirit which made them so insanely arrogant and barbaric. They will make it.What's my point here? Nukes, I suppose. People are freaking out about the Daichi meltdown(s). There can be no doubt that Tokyo Electric Power has screwed the pooch, that there was way, way too much corporate greed going on here, not to mention some serious casual assumption making on the part of their engineers. But despite the current panic, let's face it, nukes ain't going anywhere.I understand the Germans are completely freaking about it. Completely natural for them to do so, given that they are health nuts. You would think France would be freaking a bit, but no, why should they?A quick survey shows that France gets 75% of their power from fission, some 400 terawatt hours. Japan, generating a little more than 250 terrawatt hours gets about 29% of their energy from it. The big elephant in the room, with about 20% of their energy from nukes, is the US of A. Almost obscenely, at only 20%, we generate nearly 800 terrawatt hours from nuclear power. Twice what France does, and only a fifth of our total consumption! Piggy, pig, pigs! as my father used to say.But back to Japan. Some experts (hah!) are now saying this is the death knell for nukes in Japan.Oh, bullshit.You got 128 million people crammed into a nation the size of California, of which most is mountainous, and so really they are jammed into a little crinkle cut little patchwork  bits of flat land, of which most they need to keep as arable farm, with no oil, with dick for coal reserves, hydro completely in use and tapped out, no land for solar, and offshore windfarms susceptible to earthquakes and tsunamis , so what they gonna do?There's a reason they went nuclear. It wasn't just a whim. And unless somebody comes up with a science fiction gadget that either transmits power with near-zero loss, so that they can import energy, or build solar collecting satellites, or build a working fusion plant, the people of Nippon pretty much have to rely on nukes.I honestly wish for some kind of science fiction gadget that gets pulled out of our collective ass, but I'm not going to hold my breath.Um... Don't really know how to end this one, so I'll just say... Hey Japan? Get well soon."},

It is set in the near future year of 1967. Mr. Whipple, head of a vast manufacturing corporation, automates every position he can. Robots replace workers. Serling uses the standard Twilight Zone reductio ad absurdum reasoning to eventually replace the chief executive with a robot as well.Hate to say I told you so, but I told you so.  I may not have precedence, or for that matter, any profound prescience, but at least I'm on the winning side. So, here you go. In this article,  lawyers to be replaced by cheap computers. (Where's the lawyer joke?) And, in this article, pretty much anyone else to be replaced with a computer.  (And with regard to healthcare, who goes last? My money is, surgeons among the first to go, nurses the absolute last. Anyone care to wager? No. Good for you. I'll tell you why. Specialized knowledge and tasks, such as those done by doctors and surgeons, will be the first to fall to the robots. More generalized behavior, such as that done by nurses, will be harder to reproduce in silico).Would you buy a used war from this guy?Does this mean no more jobs? Oh, there will always be jobs. Some it's just cheaper to use people for. And I suspect some jobs we would never want a robot filling, like, for example, soldiers. But I have a feeling, if you can break a task down into components, you can automate it. That may even include things we would never consider as automatic tasks, like creativity, exploration, genius, random chaotic fun, curious behaviors, things that artists and authors and poets and musicians and scientists do. (No, not designers and engineers - they've already been automated).So, is it too late for us? Nah, I don't think so. But the minute the robots start having more fun than us, then we are doomed.As I sit upon this bar stool in air-conditioned splendor, in a wondrously ergonomic and aesthetically pleasing building on a heart-achingly beautiful world circling a fantastic star some 450 million light years distance from the planet Earth, here in the year 2011CE, I've to wonder how all of us, each of us, could have been so fortunate to live in the Best of All Possible Worlds. As I sit here, dictating notes and examining the might-have-been and could-still-be scenarios through a very clever device wrapped about my head (looking for all the world like a metallic hairnet, and giving me the appearance of wearing an aluminum afro), I note, for good or ill, all, the fleeting phantom pasts and futures competing for existence to become objective reality. Some scenarios are quite horrifying for being extremely unpleasant, others even more horrifying in their impossible perfection, but here everything is  just right. Yet, it didn't necessarily have to be that way, for, as I said before, the Glorious Revolution of 1877 may not have happened.Throughout the 19th century in the old US of A, there were hard times indeed, but few would find things harder, or stranger than the period of industrial expansion following their Civil War. The entire maximum effort of the country, far more than had been expended in the war, was devoted to the massive project of railroad building. Even within the confines of the Northern Union the primary focus was upon the expansion of rail into the West. This all, almost as a side note, while opposing a Confederacy fighting for its very survival. And few could understand the impact of the rail. Along with the telegraph, it threatened the destruction of time and space itself, the boundaries of which were shattered from human into inhuman dimensions. In the case of the telegraph, information moved the speed of a horse to the speed of light. With the advent of the rail, the pace and pull of an oxen was replaced a thousandfold by giant steel monsters. America would have to wait for the atomic age to see a similar leap forward.And all this came at a disastrous cost. The people of America, with industry already straining the sinews and bones of society, the rich sucking the blood and fat from the workingman, were barely able to keep up with these inhuman demands. People were breeding at the biological maximum. A flood of immigrants, stemmed by depression and war, was unleashed. Despite the expansion, jobs were parceled out by the miserly rich, to save costs and increase productivity. In an effort to make more and more monies, the situation for the average laborer was constantly deteriorating. The railroads, growing despite the woefully incompetent and criminal behaviors of the tycoons that ran them, were constantly in arrears in wages. In bad times, the first impulse of the parasitic rich was to cut the already abysmally low wages of the laborers and producers, while continuing to enjoy enormous salaries and issue high dividends to impatient investors.Such a situation could not last. And so, with the long accumulation of grievances towards the wretched plutocrats that employed them, the American workingmen finally had had enough. In July of 1877CE, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad notified its employees that it would make substantial cuts in their wages. For men barely able to feed their families on the existing pittance, emotions quickly ran the spectrum from despair to rage. On July 16, the date railroad wages were to be cut, at Camden Junction near Baltimore, Md, the workers walked out. Their strategy was to halt all freight traffic. Soon, other workers in Baltimore, both union and non-union, joined their ranks - canalboatmen, canmakers,  boxmakers, and sawyers among them. The strikes quickly spread to Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Cincinnati, Syracuse, Albany, Buffalo, St. Louis, and Chicago. The governor of Maryland called up state militias to deal with the mobs. The 5th regiment, the \"Dandy 5th\" opened fire on men, women, and children at Camden Station, but the shops and warehouses of the B&O remained in the hands of the mob.This was alarming enough. News from Pittsburgh did not help. Rumors that the officers of the Pennsylvania Railroad were forcing a freight train through the blockade there brought out a crowd of 10,000. A number of Philadelphia guard units, composed of the city's socially prominent young men, opened fire on the crowd with two Gatling guns. As reported by the New York Herald, the soldiers ceased firing revealed such a sickening sight of men and boys \"writhing in their death agonies... with a number of children killed outright\", resulted in the Pittsburgh militia throwing down their arms and joining the crowd.The flash point, the turning point, occurred in Reading, Pennsylvania (and notice we have all the railroads on the Monopoly board, save the Short Line, represented). The state militia, composed of the 4th and 16th regiment, with no provocation, opened fire on an unarmed and peaceable crowd in the middle of the city. The 4th, composed of the so-called Easton Greys, another of the \"gentleman\" units from Philadelphia, was particularly brutish. The 16th revolted and joined the mob.News of the slaughter of civilians soon reached Washington. President Hayes ordered federal troops into action. The Army, practically all Civil War veterans, refused to a man to engage in violence against the people.\"No amount of property is worth taking another innocent life\" declared General Winfield Scott*. What had started out as the most lurid and violent riot in the history, quickly evolved into armed insurrection, and then finally coup d'etat. The Glorious Revolution was upon them. The plutocracy was no more. A national convention was convened, the 18th and 19th amendments added to the Constitution. A far more fair and equitable nation was born.The interesting thing to note, some few years later and afterwards impressed into the New Business Philosophy, was that, under the citizen committees and action groups, the railroads during the strike were better run and managed than under the old bosses' network. This soon resulted in the \"wisdom of crowds\" political philosophy, the People's command economy, the open-source method of management and manufacture, and, naturally, the Free Education movement. All these in turn resulted in the realization, some one hundred years later, that \"It\", the collective consciousness of the superorganism known as Man, had actually been in charge all along. And in different circumstances, things could have gone much, much, much, much, worse.From Spiral City, Bottoms up, My Brethren and Sestren!*Note: In the majority of scenarios, General Scott said no such damn thing."},
{"title": "The Revolution That Almost Wasn't (Part 1)", "date": "Friday, March 4, 2011", "text": "Dear Readers,I'm having entirely too much fun with Alternate History themes. If it's alright with you (as if you have a choice), I think I'll continue this exploration from my barstool in the Best of All Possible Worlds...Paging Dr. Pangloss!Scrying my way through all of the possible Nows, that land of hungry ghosts of which, naturally and fortunately, there is only the One, I happened to stumble upon a particularly horrible universe.It all started with a sidewise view of just a snippet of an article, which, through great effort and expense, I managed to salvage whole from a magazine called \"The Atlantic\". It was an article about some creatures called \"the super-rich\", who, apparently, subscribe to the extinct notion that they have somehow, through dint of personal will and hard work, through some archaic notion of rugged individualism, created themselves into successful business types. This peculiar psychosis of self-created material apotheosis, with absolutely no nod at all to the vast support structure known as \"society\" that actually provided all of their good fortune, I'd have thought discredited a long time ago. But then, in this awful world from which the article originated, only a very few enjoy comfort and material wealth, while the vast majority of the Earth's populace suffer unspeakable indignities, disease, squalor, and poverty. A truly psychotic world.The clearest evidence of this psychosis is attributable to one quote in the article:The U.S.-based CEO of one of the world’s largest hedge funds told me that his firm’s investment committee often discusses the question of who wins and who loses in today’s economy. In a recent internal debate, he said, one of his senior colleagues had argued that the hollowing-out of the American middle class didn’t really matter. “His point was that if the transformation of the world economy lifts four people in China and India out of poverty and into the middle class, and meanwhile means one American drops out of the middle class, that’s not such a bad trade,” the CEO recalled.Of course, if the senior colleague had been dropped from the ranks of the super-rich, 30,000-40,000 people from China and India would have been lifted into the middle class -  a far more advantageous trade.Considering the amount of dumb luck involved in entrepreneurial decisions, an arrogant and parasitic executive being replaced by an automated management device, or even a chimp operating a coin-flipping machine, would surely have produced the same or superior administrative performance. One wonders if the senior colleague would consider my assessment any more cavalier or callous than his, and given that I am not the sociopath, I think we know the answer.Regardless, in this strange world, one barrier of predation after another was eliminated starting with the improbable election of a grade-B actor to the office of the President of the United States (following a whole series of unfortunate - and equally improbable events), resulted in something called the Neoliberal Revolution. There was nothing neo, or liberal, about it. During this period, all capital controls were done away with. Welfare payments (a form of government security to the unfortunate) were redesigned to \"force the unemployed to look for work\". (Though one would imagine a lack of income was more than incentive enough). Large swaths of regulation put in place after a fairly intense period of economic predation and collapse (during the 1920-30s) were cast aside as misguided hindrances to business. The shift lifted many protections that had shielded laborers from the harshest privations. In short, predation was proclaimed good behavior. Or at least, no longer considered bad behavior. And given that predation is merely the final form of parasitism, the parasite class, the top wealth holders, were allowed to suck all of the wealth from the wealth generators beneath them.And that is the most amazing thing of all! That these rich creeps, through some bizarro logic, came to the conclusion that they were the true wealth producers, rather than those whose honest toil had provided everything. Everything. Incredible. Because, you see, in this nightmare shadow, in this palsied parody of a society, the Glorious Revolution of 1877 had never occurred!"},

It also doesn't help to write down reminders, because usually the summary ends up being \"Note to self: Write about how it's all just a bunch of bullshit\".I want to comment again about IBM's Watson, and it's real, ultimate impact upon society.IBM's Watson's AvatarCut to the chase.Once Watson is implemented as a real expert system in dozens of professional occupations, you will see the final revenge fantasy of the working class hero. When bankers, doctors, lawyers, financial analysts, corporate executives, and engineers are standing in the breadline, because their jobs have been automated, they will receive no sympathies from the regular folks. Finally, the Eschaton of Marxism, the End Times of that particular religion, will be realized. The dictatorship of the proletariat, always assumed to be far in the future, will be here.This was aptly put in the movie \"The Incredibles\", when Syndrome/Buddy Pine/Incrediboy states \"And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions so everyone can be superheroes! Everyone can be super! And when everyone's super, no-one will be\".Welcome to the club, schmucks. You are just another expendable cog, fucker. Give up your pretense to exceptionalism, because, guess what, any talents you possess are now only marginally greater than other people's, when compared to a hypercomputer. Because, honestly, I have no doubt whatsoever that a chimpanzee brain, loaded down with the appropriate software, will easily out perform any of today's professionals. Reason being, most people's \"expertise\" is just being exposed to enough examples - and a hell of a lot of luck (often confused with skill). And with the computer's brute force ability to hold trillions of examples, several million human brains worth of examples, there really is no contest.For the past hundred, two hundred years, there are has been a battle between capital and labor. Capital has won due to the anomaly of history here in America - of an embarrassing wealth of untapped resources, land, and cheap labor. Capital (the upper classes), with the Social Darwinist/Manifest Destiny conceit, has been able to deceive itself into thinking the carrying capacity of the economic environment is infinite, and that Capital's (the upper classes') \"genius\" of continual and remarkable growth is purely one of superior talent and divine providence, when it is hardly any of the sort. It's the case of a lucky bacterium being dropped into an empty Petri dish of plenty.This country was built upon a steady supply of cheap labor and untapped resources.It's going to be fun to what happens when brains and intellect are now the cheap exploitable labor, if you, that is,  have a funny idea of what \"fun\" is."},
{"title": "2050CE Redux: \"If You Tear It Down, They Will Not Come\"", "date": "Wednesday, March 2, 2011", "text": "Actually, the phrase \"If You Tear It Down, They Will Not Come\" may be a good bumper sticker for Red State so-called \"thinking\" along federal and state budget lines. Cut revenues for science and education, and you've cut off your dick, or at least the nation's dick. Even if it is the ridiculously short one that Republicans (Mainstream and Teabaggers) seem to possess - as in can't see beyond the end of - it's still a fucking short-sighted tragedy and a completely fucked up way to balance a budget. Balanced, as always, on the backs of the present and future workers. The bankers and Wall Street parasite class? Well, fuck you man, they got yours already.Regardless, I won't turn this into another political diatribe. Room enough in the future for saying I Told You So. Instead, I was thinking of all fun I had composing the 2050CE essay. All the behind-the-scenes- world building that went into crafting a fabulation. We do it all the time in regular life. Planning. Day dreaming. Entertaining the fictive experience is rewarding in both a mental and emotional sense, but probably in a evolutionary/survival sense as well. Trying out a thought experience with no risk to life or limb does have its advantages. and it has been quite useful, after experimentation and theoretical calculations, running Monte Carlo scenarios (models, now, but not always, on computers) has been very, very fruitful.Anyway, I had fun building up a world, and a kooky theory, to hang my little speculative scarecrow on. And I do have a kooky theory. That's the nice thing about having a fable, it provides a fictional vehicle to seat your kooky theory in, so that it can be as loony as it wants to be, waving its hand to the crowd like a queen, and no one takes it seriously. Like the Emperor Norton.Anyway, here's my theory, and it has to do with time, and alternate history, and general relativity, and quantum mechanics, and all of them twisted up nicely together with time travel and add a wormhole twist.(And the cool thing about this theory is, it contains elements I cannot  - or will not - explain, and parts that, by the very fact of being intractable mysteries, make the whole thing internally consistent.  And, of course, that's the fun part of fiction. If I tell you everything up front, you won't be entertained, or curious, or terrified. The End.)So, the thing is, relativity and quantum mechanics so far irreconcilable, and the reason being is we don't quite have a handle on Time. Figure Time out, process or entity or what, and it all falls into place nicely and ready for the next conundrum. So, the figure at the top of the essay. The vertical dimension of time, and the horizontal dimension of space labelled \"Hyperplane of the Present\" or \"The Infinite Elsewhen\". Now replace the label of \"space\" with Chance. In which case it becomes the \"Hyperplane of All Possible Presents\". With me so far? Okay. Here's the kicker.There's only the one present. There are no others. In other words, no parallel timelines, no parallel universes. There are, however a whole multitude of futures and pasts. Weird, huh?There is only the one timeline.  Only the one universe to change through time travel, and yet, no changes are allowed. Or at least no changes that allow paradoxes to occur. Is this a paradox?Some might say, \"Oh simple, this is just a variation of the old Godellian closed timelike curves, but with future postselecting them so that no backwards time travelling causes a grandfather paradox or suchlike. Something like the theoretical experiments that Seth Lloyd and his team have played with recently\".Um. No. Whomever it was that said that. No.Alright then, this is similar to what David Deutsch has proposed. That if you go back in time, you go back to a different past than the one you remember. Like, you can go back and twist the heads off as many dinosaurs as you want and nothing bad happens, right? Um. No. There's only one Now, remember. If you go back into the past, you are in that Now, and there's only one of them. Interesting thing in this scenario is, even though that past is now the Now that is the past you remember (the \"real\" past) you can twist the heads off all the dinosaurs you want and not change the future. Weird, huh? How do I explain it? I don't.So, is this a variation of Roger Zelazny's \"Amber\" series? There's only the one really real universe and all others are shadows? ...maybe. ... kind of. But the difference is, there are no other shadow universes. You can't pull a travel to parallel dimensions in the present routine.No all the futures influence the one present, just as all the pasts influence the present. They are ghosts tugging at your legs and arms. That's the weird thing. That's the key. That's the fun. All of those awful things I wrote about? All Monte Carlo simulations, but real, but not real.But, for some reason, in every single alternate history scenario, President Sarah Palin is eventually eaten by her office staff. Funny how things work out, huh?"},

{"title": "2050CE: A Fable", "date": "Wednesday, February 23, 2011", "text": "It is generally thought that in 1801CE the English scientist Thomas Young first performed the Double Slit experiment. In your universe, maybe...Young set up this elegantly simple demonstration of allowing a light to pass through either one hole, or two holes that were side by side. In doing so, he attempted to see whether light was a particle, a corpuscular thing as Newton surmised, or if light was a wave traveling through some marvelous aether. The answer was both, but not at the same time. Still stranger was, the choice could be, or was, or will be made after the light had passed through the hole(s). Richard Feynman was able to describe this, and many other fascinating things, by invoking something called the Feynman path integral. This bit of mathematical legerdemain is also referred as the \"sum over histories\" method, although I refer to it as the \"sum over futures\" method. And you should to, if you know what is good for you.What has this to do with the year 2050CE?Granted, that was a long time ago, but bear with me.There are, it turns out, certain pivotal years, which, as the great physicist Mark Everett once stated, are \"uchronal, they remain constant throughout all transreal states\". Which is to say, certain important events occur regardless of the universe they occur in. Or more specifically, the parachronic sample space contains a very large but finite amount of alternatives, which is just as well, as having to divide everything by infinity just produces nonsense.Mark's father, Hugh Everett (Many Worlds Interpretation) suspected as much, but could never quite get the math down. Fortunately for this correspondent (and you as well, gentle reader) living in the best of all possible worlds means the Mark postponed his lucrative rock n' roll career and finished his father's great work.Which means we know that the years 10,380 BCE, 6,212 BCE, 512BCE, 38CE, 512CE, 1848CE, 2050CE,... just to name a few, remain temporally invariant. Interesting, that. And still not quite explained.But I digress. Year 2050CE. In the vast majority of scenarios, Earth is not a world anymore. It is a welfare planet.Population pegged out at 9 billion, with perhaps ten million haves, the rest a brutally suppressed permanent have-nots. Every square inch of arable land devoted to agriculture. No more wilderness. No more wild animals. China, India, Brazil, parts of North America: vast desert. Africa, a war grave. The Arctic permanently ice free. It is a miracle almost all nukes have been accounted for and stashed in Canada, which enjoys its hegemonic superpower status. After the collapse, the forward thinking United States military (who would have thought? as in who would have thought the KGB would be the enlightened element with the former Soviet Union?) turned most of their stuff over to Canada, the one bright spot in an otherwise dismal decade. Killer robots. Helper robots.No jobs, or no skilled jobs at any rate, as the robots and computers do all that brainy stuff. Few unskilled jobs, save for environmental remediation. On the mystery front, the remains of President Palin finally located in the Cheyenne Mountain complex. The cut marks on her bones indicating she was one of the last to be eaten. Rank hath its privileges.Within the celebrity network, Paris Hilton, Jr. is scheduled for her fifth litter (sired off of Ashton Kutcher GM SEED), to be donated to the Oil Trust for liquifaction. Oil is currently $1,250,000 a barrel (except that price is in yuan). A Vlad Teppes clone is to be resurrected for a year on Death Match. And the world's largest TV will be moved to its new home in Novo Beijing. The last known modified white tiger man hunted down, shot, and stuffed  within Bharat Forever (formerly known as Alaska).So sad. But, hey, seeing as (thanks to Dr. Mark Everett) our wormhole technologies allows us to live in the Best of all possible worlds, I'm not so sad after all.BTW, next week, Tuesday evening, from 7pm on, I plan to be making an appearance in Sam's Pub, 1200 W Lankhmar Street, Spiral City, Alterra, NGC6264.

{"title": "Political Affiliations", "date": "Monday, February 21, 2011", "text": "I call myself a liberal because it pisses off certain brittle-minded tiny-limbed meatslappers who persist in trying to make liberal a disparaging word. If calling myself a progressive, or a socialist, or even a communist causes them to have a debilitating stroke from a fit of apoplectic rage, I'd call myself that.But, of course, I'm a moderate.In fact, I rather detest the idea of cataloguing something as complex as a human being onto a one-dimensional mapping such as \"Left-Right\". And look where that came from, out of the French Revolution, not exactly the best thing to use as an an example for anything.For that matter, those silly magazine quiz political tests which lump you onto a two-dimensional surface (economic and social axes) are equally a waste of time. No one is that consistent, or that cartoonish (with perhaps the exemption of people who enjoy simplistic worldviews and the people who love them - on the next Jerry Springer). Those silly things want to lump you down with some really creepy people with bad personal hygiene. I certainly would not put up with it. When you think about it, a pigeon hole is a nasty, cramped, shit covered little hole.And, an expansion of political identity into higher dimensions would seem to be the way to go, but the problem is, once again, people are rarely that consistent. They change over time (indeed the universe itself changes over time, so one wonders how even maintaining the status quo is somehow not just a complete infantile fantasy). There do seem to be some common sense ideas on higher dimensional axes to investigate. You've perhaps a Progress vs. Tradition axis. An Individualism vs. Altruism axis. And Anarchy vs Control axis. An Equality vs. Merit axis. Perhaps even a Competition vs. Cooperation axis.I doubt all but a very few unfortunates could be boxed down onto a segment of this political hyperspace.So, I'll just call myself a liberal, and fuck you if you don't like it.Now, then, let's consider who those who are not liberals have got in the stable for the 2012 Presidential Elections.CPAC provided no help. The terminally bugfuck crazy Michelle Bachmann? Actually, I kind of enjoy seeing her to see how what is clearly the mad cow disease she has contracted is spreading. Last I saw she had acquired a hazy film of insane chimpanzee glaze in her eyes. It's only a matter of time before she starts clubbing small children that are within reach of her.Ron Paul? Rand Paul? Maybe if Congress passes a law making inhaling household cleaners and automotive products mandatory. (Catch us all up to speed with them).Donald Trump? He's just a hairy little faex. He's completely feculent. Pizza mogul Herman Cain? Well, #1, Godfather's Pizza sucks a fat soggy turd.  And #2, Herman Cain is an asshole.Let me repeat that for the search engine spiders.Herman Cain is an asshole.NO, come one, seriously! CPAC!!!!??? CPAC was for chronic masturbators. CPAC was, is Political Bukkake Theater. (You've heard of Political Kabuki Theater? Welcome to  a whole 'nother show!)  Fuck CPAC.Here's the real list:Mitt Romney: Boring. Has been. What have you done for me lately? He may be the one the Republicans get stuck with, but he's got the whole vacillation problem going on. Not to mention a woodenness that make Al Gore look like a genuinely warm human being. Plus, he's got the branding issue with his chosen faith. He'd have done only slightly worse becoming a Scientologist. Or a Randian.Mitch Daniels: Looks too much like Dan Quayle, who basically made it so that even if you are a Hoosier with a 3,000 IQ, you're, well, from Indiana. I know. As a Hoosier, I'm just glad people have bad memories. Plus, Daniels doesn't reckon the amount of luck involved in his state's budget surplus, which, oops, ain't there anymore, now that Obama's stimulus money is gone.  Daniels didn't exactly display any amazing fucking brilliant business acumen when he sold the Indiana Tollroad to Spaniard businessmen for a pittance. Plus, he's the smart conservative's (yes, they do exist) choice, which means the kiss of death from the Party of Fuck You.Haley Barbour: Boss Hogg!!! He's got the KKK vote locked up solid. If they can run him with a orangutan that waves a loaded pistol and gives everyone the finger, he's got the vote of everyone south of I-70, ... probably, but, is that enough? I don't think so. Not lessen' he can rid the Real America of all those darkies in the urban hoods... which, oh, was that over the top? Hmm.Herman Cain is an asshole!Newt Gingrich: You know, I kind of admire the rancid old assfuck the same way I admire Mao. He just doesn't get it. It's monumentally stupendous how he doesn't get it. But he does try. Using the same tactics of fear and divisiveness that Mao used, well at least he tries. But he'll never be a monster. Besides, he screwed himself up the ass in 1996. And besides, have you seen him lately? The guy looks like a used condom. And by that I mean he looks like a wrinkled up latex wrapper partially filled with dead sperm. Pretty much sums up Newt.Who's left? Pawlenty, Santorum, Huckabee? Boring. Oatmeal.PALIN? Wow. Pretty sad. Not much interest. Maybe, if Wisconsin governor Wanker, I mean Walker, continues to fuck up Wisconsin's finances (the way he did Milwaukee County's when he was commissioner), and gets all hard ass with the middle class, he just might be a conservative hero and lock it all in!But in the meantime, I have a suggestion. More interest in the primaries can be generated if you set it up as a series of Death Cage matches, but for real. You know, Thunderdome, but for real. And orangutans with automatic weapons!  And cannibalism! Herman Cain is an asshole!(2/25/11 Note to readers. Above essay was modified for stylistic purposes, just in case you noticed)."},
{"title": "Machines of Loving Grace", "date": "Friday, February 18, 2011", "text": "I'm ashamed to say I've not read much in the way of poetry or great classics. One of the few books of poetry I read was \"The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster\" by Richard Brautigan. There is a poem in there which I reproduce with attribution. All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving GraceI'd like to think (andthe sooner the better!)of a cybernetic meadowwhere mammals and computerslive together in mutuallyprogramming harmonylike pure watertouching clear sky.I like to think   (right now, please!)of a cybernetic forestfilled with pines and electronicswhere deer stroll peacefullypast computersas if they were flowerswith spinning blossoms.I like to think   (it has to be!)of a cybernetic ecologywhere we are free of our laborsand joined back to nature,returned to our mammal brothers and sisters,and all watched overby machines of loving grace.copyright 1968 by Richard Brautigan      From a craft standpoint, it's not really that good of a poem. From a visionary standpoint, I'd say Brautigan rivaled Stanislaw Lem in clairvoyance. (If you are unaware of Lem, go to the library and check out The Cyberiad for starters). I'm not entirely sure that Brautigan coined the term \"machines of loving grace\". I would not be at all surprised if it goes back to Mark Twain. I seem to recall a dystopian SF short story by that title (or perhaps it just employed the phrase). The story was about how people had become completely dependent upon machines, to the point where they were just fat blobs waited upon hand and foot by mechanical creatures - coddled and swaddled so much that they had no exposure to any form of Nature or even their fellow human beings. Thus unable to breed, or breed successfully, or thrive, humanity is pampered out of existence.In retrospect, the story was arrogantly flawed. There is no doubt that we as a species would allow ourselves to be pampered thus, but the idea that so much energy and resources would be devoted to these overgrown infants defies any realistic expectations. At the very least, the Universe would come up with a way to bollox the whole operation - resulting in either our demise as a species, or at least a very sobering return to a more challenging way of life.But thoughts of our relationship with technology have bugged me of late. No, I'm not thinking of the Jeopardy! games with IBM's Watson. That is, big-picture-wise, hardly the news item the media wishes to inflate it into. We are years, decades away from an artificial intelligence, perhaps even never (though I am loathe to say that, seeing as predictions of impossibilities are almost always wrong).No, I'm thinking more along the lines of how we always, always overestimate the impacts of our technology. Case(s) in point: Alfred Nobel believed that his explosives would deter men from making war. Hiram Maxim, inventor of the machine gun, declared that his invention would \"make war impossible\". Jules Verne stated that with the submarine, war would become impossible. Orville Wright: \"The aeroplane...will have a tendency to make war impossible\". Marconi: \"the coming of the wireless era... will make war impossible\". Do I really need to go on? Pretty sad, actually. You'd think, after so many utterly failed predictions, that someone would catch on, and not say something silly like that. And yet, it's not only the theater of war where we are so comedically wrong-headed. David Nye, historian of technology, points out \"Each new form of communication, from the telegraph and telephone to radio, film, television, and the internet, has been heralded as the guarantor of free speech and the unfettered movement of ideas\".Yeah, well. The techno-cheerleaders didn't count much on human behavior. Given the deluge of crap that came out of radio, TV, and film, one has to wonder how much of the promise of enlightenment and edification will occur through the internet. How many lies have been propagated over radio, TV, film,  the Internet? How much dis- and misinformation will be out there forever and ever and ever? Did any of the cheerleaders see google versus China coming, profit preferential search engines, censored search results, the Egyptian shutdown of the internet, or the vapid tweetings from the likes of that fucking shrill shriek Sarah Palin, or being wholly dependent upon Facebook for any kind of social interactions, or similar troglodytic usages...?Chimps waving loaded guns, for the most part. That seems, on the face of it, to be where the 21st century is heading.And so, like all abrogations of responsibility, I've got to wonder just how much we are relying on technology to save us from ourselves, when the fact of the matter is, technology is ourselves.Was Pogo right? \"We have met the enemy, and they is us\"?"},
{"title": "Life, Liberty, the Pursuit of Happiness, but no mention of Property", "date": "Tuesday, February 15, 2011", "text": "Conservatives will often misrepresent the intentions of the Founding Fathers with regards to property. They do so by presenting a little bit of revisionist history through finding quotes that they can take out of context, or by simply fabricating a 18th century intentions and mannerisms through the prism of modern times.Generally, such people will present themselves as wholly reasonable. They will call themselves critical thinkers. (One has only to look at the laughable name of the Libertarian magazine \"Reason\" to recognize expropriation - aping an aspiration is not the same as being it).But, for the most part, these types of Constitutional fundamentalists, these strict constructionists fail to see that there rhetorical ploy is nothing more than that logical fallacy known as a Red Herring. (In other words, there assertion actually has nothing to do with anything that can be found in the Constitution). There are usually more than one logical fallacies mixed up together, but this one will suffice.Why do I say this? Because, quite simply the society and the people who lived in those times are completely alien to us now. Not \"alien\" in the sense of foreign, but \"alien\" in the science fiction sense of almost incomprehensible. For conservatives (Tea Partiers, etc.) to assume that they can speak for that generation of men which included the Founding Fathers is completely fucking stupid.They lived with a mindset that was wholly medieval. They lived (and this is before the concept of \"class\" existed) in a hierarchical arrangement that went from God to King to Noble to Gentleman to Yeoman Farmers and Merchants to Serf to Slave. Each role was legitimate, completely natural, and eternally sanctioned and divinely approved. One had better know one's place and be prepared to suffer the consequences of attempting to exercise equality.Yes, yes, they made noise about liberty and freedom, but those liberties and freedoms were caste specific and stratified. A slave had a certain amount of freedom which, within the confines of his category, were his to enjoy, but only thus. (A woman, no freedoms at all). And the Founding Fathers were intent upon only the slightest modifications as to personal liberties for those under them. Their vision - and it can be found in quotes taken wholly in context and understood properly only in context - was a republic run by a well-educated, well-informed, enlightened, idle, landed gentry through disinterested (and therefore incorruptible and transcendent) representation. No rabble running things for them! No dirty fingernailed, illiterate, ill-mannered filthy mob mucking things up in the halls of government. Mind your place and your tone, my man, and be thankful we exist to govern! No universal suffrage! Gentlemen only in the governing ranks, if you please! (As to one of the foremost proponents of universal suffrage, one who helped to dismantle of the early aristocracy, one has to look, not to Jefferson, but to a compatriot of his, an unpleasant man called Abraham Bishop).Here, perhaps is a classic example of what a gentleman is, one whose appendages are wholly useless to him. The future president John Adams, on traveling to England, was asked to man the bailing pumps aboard his sailing ship, a duty to which every passenger was bound. John Adams refused. He would rather drown than perform undignified, ungentlemanly manual labor. (It was only later, through appropriate face saving narratives that our other great historical figures were seen to somehow perform labor, thus George Washington could be seen to be a hard worker, riding his horse from sunup to sundown, managing his interests through his slaves).Universal suffrage, the ability form the common man to represent himself in government, was still some thirty to forty years in the future at the time of the signing of the Constitution. In fact, such is the complaints and grumbling of our Founding Fathers about the failure of the Revolution, that once universal suffrage had come to pass, \"any common jackass could run for office\".What is unrecognized about the Revolution, perhaps the most radical and fundamental change to come about, was the transformations Americans made in their understanding of property. We went from a medieval to a modern worldview. (In fact, it can be argued that the classic \"propertarianism\", your standard modern bonehead Libertarian view, is nothing more than an attempt to return to feudalism - in that the social contracts regarding property take precedence over all other contracts).In classical pre-universal-suffrage thought, property, landed property required no representation or protection. It was wholly proprietary, part of a gentleman's identity and the source of his authority. It was not a commodity, not something to be acquired through labor, nor bought nor sold upon the market. And being so, free of the caprices of the market, a gentleman was unassailably free from special interest (the incorruptibility mentioned above), and the thus perfectly suited to govern. (This philosophical position, unassailable through logical analysis, quickly fell apart under empirical - more worldly - conditions).If property were a mere material possession, why then any jackass had an equal right to acquire it, and it (the right to property) would become, as the 1820 convention notes of the New York Republicans put it, \"only one of many incidental rights of the person who possessed it\", but still \"insignificant and trifling\" compared to \"other essential rights\". This, then is why there is no mention of property in any of the so-called \"hallowed\" texts of the conservative fundamentalists - neither the Declaration of Independence, nor the Constitution.This no doubt, if it were ever truly comprehended by today's conservatives, if it could make it through the thick gelatinous wall of ignorance constructed around their fossilized skulls, would probably drive them into an apoplectic fit. But then, the Founding Fathers would look down on these moderns pipsqueaks anyway: peasants, proletarians, dirty filthy laborers daring to live above their station."},

I don't think a copyright infringement is involved here (I'm sure the corporate entity that sent it had their legal department check it out). But it appears to be something that I should be worried about.Now, keep in mind, I've had a bullshit detector installed in my brain since I was twelve. And it has been set on maximum sensitivity. So much so, that actual facts often set the klaxons blaring and red lights to flash.But this letter was so blatantly clumsy, I switched off my bullshit detector before it even had much of a chance to register it.I'd post a picture of it, but it's more fun to describe it. So, you've got the standard US government IRS looks about it. The graphic format, the fold strip openings at the side, the fake form id  \"FORM 11598\".

And then, in 8 point type, psst, hey,  \"This is not a government document\".And then it is all balloons and dancing bears after that. Arlington Nissan wants to sell me a car. Here's a big money number, $37,941 and zero cents as my available line of credit. With an additional  $15,759 and zero cents for who the fuck knows what. I guess I'm to assume that together the sum is my authorized amount, but that's for my greedy little mind to figure out.So, they got me all palm sweaty and worried, and then, oh, no Mr. Kurman, it's good news, and we really don't give a shit about your credit history.

Eh, so what.)(Three Jeopardy! episodes involving Watson as a contestant are scheduled for Feb. 14-16th, 2011).The usual questions are of course, how can Watson play Jeopardy! Well, watch the NOVA episode. I'd rather talk about the Chinese Room.I used to visit and occasionally contribute to a internet forum which had a participant who, had there not already been one, should have been the patron saint of lost causes. If there was a silly position to take on a subject, this guy would be a staunch proponent. If memory serves, he was an advocate for astrology, Ayn Rand and Objectivism, libertarianism, Zionism,  his own variation of Rupert Sheldrake's morphogenesis, and all sorts of other strange things. He wasn't a complete loon, but...And I seem to recall that he had a peculiar argumentative style not unlike the cowardly and slippery method of  Socrates, in that he would never actually assert anything, but rather answer questions with questions. (I say cowardly because Socrates never actually took a stand on anything). In any case, he actually did make the assertion that computers would never be intelligent like people because a guy named John Searle provided an ironclad proof that computers could mimic human behavior but never understand it. This argument is called The Chinese Room.John Searle in the Chinese Room You can either read the link, or, well, here's the short version. A kind of Rube Goldberg computer or an automaton is set up in an empty room (a black box, if you will) wherein a Chinese person can hold a conversation with it. There is a library of data and a rule book that allows any sentence or question in the Chinese language to be processed and answered. So a Chinese person can talk to the Chinese Room, and after a sufficient conversation, become convinced that he is talking to another Chinese person within the room. In other words, the computer's behavior is indistinguishable from a person's and the computer passes what is called a Turing Test, and so must be considered an intelligent being.But here is Searle's catch. The library and rule book are not in Chinese. They could be, since this is a computer, all zeroes and ones. But for the purposes of Searle's argument, they are in English. They are in English so that Searle can take the place of the computer or automaton. He gets the Chinese statement as input, he follows the rules and accesses the data in English, to respond in Chinese as output. Searle fools the Chinese interlocutor that he understands Chinese, when in fact, Searle never understands what he is saying, just like the computer. In short, the computer does not understand.Well, so what? You say. And justly so. Isn't this just another one of those stupid philosophical arguments? Doesn't this just show that the Turing Test doesn't cut the mustard? Doesn't this illuminate a point that anyone past the mental age of six can figure out? That appearances are deceiving? That the stuffed animal puppet is really not a real person.Well, yes and no. It does turn out that the argument is stupid, and it all hinges on Searle's implication that just because he doesn't understand Chinese, therefore the automaton or computer doesn't either. You see, there have many objections to his argument, but the strongest is that, even though the whole process is mechanical and completely syntax driven, that no semantics, no meanings are derived out of the process. In short, the program may not understand, but the Room (automaton or mechanism or what have you, plus program) clearly does. Searle's counterpoint to that is, fine, I will memorize the whole library of data and rule book (which is all in English), and now the Room is completely inside his head. Now he can speak directly to the Chinese interlocutor, process everything in English in his head and understand not one word of Chinese.But all this does in further illustrate the weakness of his argument. By simulating the Room inside his head, he expect us to believe that he is the Room. In other words, his mental simulations exactly duplicate the physical states of the Chinese Room. But, he is hoisted upon his own petard. His mental simulation is clearly not the same. It is a simulation. Therefore, the fact that he John Searle does not understand Chinese is not the same statement as the Chinese Room doesn't understand Chinese.Well. okay. So what? Well, the point was that the patron saint of lost causes, invoking Searle, felt that computers could never, ever really be intelligent. Can't  they?Watson clearly isn't. But Watson isn't just doing what the Chinese Room is doing (which is basically, the way old digital computers and their now primitive 1970s architectures did things). Watson uses an incredibly powerful technique called machine learning. Machine learning is learning by example, by trial and error. This is far more powerful than mere following of rules, because the rules (if any exist) are changeable by more and more examples. Watson can change his behavior just like people (most people).Does this mean Watson and computers like him (it) might eventually get smart? Why not?"},
{"title": "Primitive and Paranoid Savages (part 2)", "date": "Thursday, February 10, 2011", "text": "As a cynical optimist, I recognize that there is never any true progress in the world, no directed progress at any rate. Like the evolution of organisms, there is no goal, and yet, just through a ratcheting process, some things improve without a plan. Some would call this progress, and sometimes ascribe a teleological cause behind it all. I do neither.I occasionally will visit other websites that purportedly have a superior take on things, a more studied view of events at large, as the denizens are - or advertise themselves to be - intellectually superior to your average lumpkin. One such site is Edge.org. I used to visit there quite frequently, but then I discovered that I wasn't learning anything new there. That the discussions between the \"most complex and sophisticated minds\" weren't all that interesting. Were, in fact, downright slow and plodding. I'm not sure if that is because those minds were trying to dumb down their thoughts to a wider audience. Or perhaps, specialists talking outside their specialty, were no wiser than the average lumpkin.Regardless, I found that, at one point or another, I'd already picked up the tidbits of information and scientific popcorn. I'd find an insight they provided one I'd already considered. Or still worse, an insight I'd considered, rejected, and moved on from some statement they had provided perhaps ten or twenty years ago. To this day, I'm pretty much fed up with the Daniel Dennetts, the Richard Dawkinses, the Jarod Laniers, the Jared Diamonds, the Brian Greens, and said,\"Dudes, please. It's the 21st century. Contemporize yourselves already\".Another such site is Crooked Timber. I liked it at first, because the contributors and commenters did a pretty good job of making fun of libertarians. But after awhile, that gets old. And besides, I found that most of the discussions invariably devolved into a cramped wrestling match over minutiae. I'm not quite sure why academic types do that, but they do seem to pick a completely tangential point to obsess over, and miss out on the original bone of contention.Take the latest doings in Egypt. There was a short essay by John Quiggin, invoking Francis Fukuyama's 1989 \"End of History\" essay. In it, he (Fukuyama) lamented that - since it seemed that with the fall of Communism, everyone was headed towards becoming a parliamentary democracy of one or another flavor of  liberal capitalist stripe - that history was going to get a lot more boring. (There's a lot more to the  essay than that, but, bear with me here. Don't get all twisted up in sidebars).Well, we can grant Fukuyama a certain amount of slack here (given that we enjoy a perspective twenty years up the line, and that Fukuyama is a cosseted ivory tower academic) that his analysis is sweetly naive. It would indeed have been such a nice world where an unfettered and unthreatened Russian and Chinese peoples could thrive and grow and be free, but such was not meant to be. Such was not meant to be in the Western republics, for that matter.But now Quiggin seems to assume that the same thing (democracy) will happen in the Islamic world. Or at least he suggests that we entertain the notion. We can forgive the opining of the commenters as basically the usual middlebrow blather that occurs among the internet denizens - usually white, upper-middle-class, Anglo-Americans with no real life-and-death struggles under the copious belts - as just so much bloodless intellectual snooze. Night drool on their fluffy pillows.Because no where at any time are the real roles of the real players mentioned - the security services, the army, the police, the secret police. In Egypt, nothing, and I mean nothing is going to happen one way or the other without the army's say-so. There is confusion linking the tyrant (Mubarak) with the army, and yet history has shown again and again that these two entities are entirely and completely separate.This is not to belittle the demonstrators and protestors. It is a statement of fact. The pro-democracy forces may or may not be brought to the table, but if they are, it will be at the convenience (or inconvenience, for this the job of protest) of the security forces.This is not merely a result of brute force in action. Special interests are involved (one has only to take a look at our own American revolution to see how this works). With the advent of the Israeli-Egypt Peace Accords, subsidized by the US of A, the Egyptian army had little to do but go into business and control private enterprise. And go into business they did, and in a big way. (To cut to the point, have a gander at how Russia and China are doing to see the new political model: security forces run businesses, discover the joys of profit and the delights of private enterprise). Now, when you are business, the one thing you do not want is uncertainty. You do not want chaos. The army (and other security industries) want an end to chaos. If it means a form of participatory democracy, then so be it. Just so long as they get to keep the cash. And perhaps this is the way Mubarak will be treated: given a large severance package, a golden parachute for despots, and let business continue.We have seen something similar (not exactly like it, but similar) unfold within the US of A, with the rise of the MIC, the military/industrial/congressional complex back in 1916. 1916 did I say? Surely I meant 1946 or 1956 or something closer to Eisenhower's speech. Nope. 1916. That is the date when a significant portion of US GDP first went to armaments, and a lot of people in power realised that this was a very, very good thing. Not for the country, for them. (Because, remember, the armaments industry is not in the business of making arms. It is in the business of making money).We see various populists \"revolts\" (for example, the current Tea Party) occur, which seem on the surface to be anti-government, pro-democracy and pro-individual, and yet, they only get what does not inconvenience the MIC. Their corporate sponsors, apparently have no objection to cuts in basic science or cultural programs. After all, Americans are being bred for a return to docile servitude, so what does it matter if the US of A withers to nothing? The industry is intact and making money. That is what is important. It is only when an unruly populace inconveniences the business planners that concessions are made. (At least, unless the situation become completely untenable, then, well, you know the drill. Revolution).This, then, not entirely modeled on the US model, but close, is the new political seascape in the Middle East. So, revolution, just not what anyone wanted or expected. Business as usual."},
{"title": "Primitive and Paranoid Savages", "date": "Wednesday, February 9, 2011", "text": "It is said that the U.S.S.R. briefly enjoyed a military parity against the US of A in 1971 - for a golden moment of perhaps 2 weeks.In order to do this, the Soviet leadership doubled military spending over the course of the 1960s - spending up to perhaps 40% of their GDP, and basically skeletonizing their domestic economy and bankrupting the country. Despite Republican propaganda to the contrary, it was not Ronald Reagan who won the Cold War so much as the Soviets who lost it. (And even then, and to this very day, the cold war \"victory\" of the United States involved American cities still being targeted by 5,000 or so ex-Soviet nuclear warheads. Some \"victory\").Why would any sane leadership do this? No really? Why?Well, the standard answer is that they were reacting to military expenditures on the part of the the US and NATO. That, and the fact that, being the quasi-religious zealots that they were, they were attempting to export the revolution to the world required that they make sacrifices.I'm sorry, that doesn't wash. Especially since the Soviet records and interviews are freely available after the downfall, of what the Soviet leadership's motivation and justifications were.So, there was a mindset similar to that of Israel  which was: Never Again. The Soviets lost 26 million people in World War II. Let me spell that out for you to let that number sink in. Twenty-six million people dead.  That is a wounding that lays heavily upon a nation's consciousness and character. We citizens of the United States, having never suffered a serious invasion or loss of life, EVER, cannot even comprehend what it does to the national psyche.So, there's that. Couple that with a game of technological catch-up against their Western rivals, a lack of incentive - aside from a dubiously inconsistent patriotism - on the part of their citizens, a seriously underfunded and underdeveloped infrastructure spread across the largest nation on Earth, and you have a fairly large incentive to invest in areas that do not provide for, or enrich, your own people.But the biggest reason by far, bar none, (in retrospect, based upon solid empirical evidence) was the firm conviction that the United States of America would inevitably attack the Soviet Union with a nuclear first strike.\"Impossible!\" you might cry. \"We Americans are a peace loving people! We would never launch a first strike against the Soviets! That would be insane!\"Well, who said we were sane? If you take a step back and look at Americans as if they were an alien culture, if you look dispassionately at our culture and history, you have to admit that we are a not a nice people. We have engaged in genocide, enslaved whole nations, attacked our neighbors, taken what we want. We have lied, cheated, stolen. Our leaders and followers, both brilliant and brutish, and consistently been ruthless, remorseless. We are a juggernaut that built up a continental empire, and then moved onwards to world domination. We are quick to take offense, slow to forgive. Pathologically insane. Psychotic.  Murderously, diabolically, inexorably atavistic and grasping. A nation that will go ape-shit insane at the slightest provocation, either real or imagined.The Russians looked at us and said \"They are exactly like us. They are brutes. Beasts. Our kind of people. They would do exactly what we would do if we could. In fact, why have they not done it? Obviously they will attack us\".Need I say more?"},
{"title": "The Groundhog Day Blizzard of 2011", "date": "Friday, February 4, 2011", "text": "Friday, February 4, 2011So, it's my fault. Apologies for that. Here I went and talked about Chicago blizzards and forgot to mention the Jan 1-3 Blizzard of 1999. Law of Attraction and all that bullshit. Mother Nature decided to set things straight.Actually, despite what you hear in the news, it wasn't all that bad. We closed the college down at 3pm Tuesday. When I drove home visibility was around a quarter of a mile. Not much to do, really. I had had three days to prepare and was well-stocked and ready. So, after dinner, I sensibly started drinking. Not hard drinking, mind you, just to find a comfortable buzz and maintain it. Because the plan was, you see, to get out into that blizzard and experience it firsthand. Which I did. Multiple times.The snow really didn't start to kick in until about 9pm. Visibility about 100 yards. Still a few idiot drivers out, obviously thinking themselves invulnerable with 4-wheel drives. They would have second thoughts before the night was out. Drifts were starting to build, with winds a steady 40 mph gusting to 60. (O'hare airport, some three miles east of me, would register gusts 70 mph). We had not quite reached the description of \"not a fit night out for man nor beast\". The next excursion occured a little after 10:30pm. Walked out into the unplowed street, I kicked the snow and found the pavement buried down at around six inches or so. A heavy, burly wind barreled straight out of the northeast with snow so thick it felt like rain. And then, and then, yes! Thundersnow! The entire sky glowed a brilliant blue, silhouettes of trees stark against it. The thunder came growling down a few seconds later. I let out a series of whoops in response and did a little storm dance. I walked around the neighborhood, everything just slightly unfamiliar, and by the time I came back in, an hour later, my wool cap, jeans, and beard are soaked to the skin. I'm ashamed to say it felt really good to be out in it, but common sense prevailed. The last excursion occured around midnight. The snow, which seemed heavy before, had multiplied in intensity. Thunder and lightning still played about in the sky, but even this seemed hidden and muffled by the snow. Visibility was down to perhaps 25 yards or so. I tried to find the hole I had kicked in the street, and found only a uniform foot of snow, with perhaps a slight dimple of an impression. I'd had my fill of all this, and went back inside, thankful that my building still had electrical power. The houses south of me did not. I awoke to warmth.The following day, the sun jumped out early, around noon. The blizzard warning was supposed to expire at 3pm. I lazed around until 1pm, then it's out to dig out the car.The manager of my shitbox apartment complex had made two passes with the plow, enough to create an alpine ski path. There was a perhaps 2 foot high by 4 feet deep wall of snow between my car and the path. Fortunately it was a light fluffy snow, perfect downhill schuss snow instead of heart-attack snow, and so it is easy to remove. I help my neighbor remove the snow from his car, so that I may use his shovel. The Tragedy of the Commons, itself a completely bullshit hypothetical essay, does not exist here. Each helps the other the out, so the vehicles may be moved to the street. Each of us does so knowing that the parking lot will not be plowed otherwise. Snow shovelling thus proved that the concepts of altruism and selfishness are not mutually exclusive. Ayn Rand was obviously a stupid, stupid woman.With all cars evacuated, I decided to tour the town. The world was bright, blinding bright, but smaller. A little more cramped than two days before. A touch more claustrophobic, as four-lane streets are now two laners, two laners but footpaths, as to either side drifts are piled above eye level. Parking lots hold snow mountains and foot hills, and one wonders why winter play lands are not created with all the snow. Why the flatland of Illinois cannot be creatively festooned with hillslides and zoomflumes of snow and ice. Instead they search desperately to dump the snow.As I drove around, I saw ravens. BIG ravens. My beloved birds were out. Extreme circumstances forced them to become bold. Though they are supremely adapted for the cold, much more than I, they need to eat, and so searched for what little there was. I am happy to have seen them. They not so much I.All in all, it was a great time!"},
{"title": "Spooky Action at An Instance", "date": "Thursday, January 27, 2011", "text": "Albert Einstein did not like Quantum Mechanics. \"God does not play dice!\" he is famously known to say. Few know Neils Bohr's reply: \"Albert, stop telling God what to do\".Einstein and Bohr were constantly jousting over QM. Einstein had to admit that the theory was stunningly accurate, but did not like it's stochastic nature, it's seeming reliance on statistics and probability. To Einstein, the theory was unpalatable and incomplete, and he would come up with one gedanken - a thought experiment - after another to stymie Bohr.One such gedanken is the EPR Paradox. The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment - overly simplified - goes something like this. Let us take a molecule composed of two similar atoms such that the atoms have opposite spins (not like the way a top spins, but no matter). If one atom has spin-axis-up, the other will automatically have spin-axis-down. Now, QM can describe the molecule with a state equation, or a quantum wave equation. With such a description, the two atoms can said to be entangled, they share a fundamental information. We then separate the molecule and send the two atoms whizzing away from each other. How far? Why, as far as you like, billions of light years aparts if you wish. But for the purposes of the paradox, far enough so that, for purposes of communication, light takes a long time to go between them.Now, we have two experimental detecting machines that these atoms fly into. These detectors will tell you what kind of spin the atoms have. (Keep in mind that the atoms always have opposite spin). If detector #1 tells you it's atom has a spin-axis-up, then the other detector has no choice but to tell you that it's atom is spin-axis-down. In other words, even though the atoms are separated by billions of light years, they are still entangled as if they had never been separated. This is what Einstein referred to as \"spooky action at a distance\". The paradox is that by measuring one atom you instantaneously receive information about the other atom, even though the other atom may be so far away that the only conventional explanation is that information was sent faster than the speed of light, which violates Einstein's relativity, which is a no-no.Clear as mud? Well, sorry, but every search entry under \"EPR Paradox for Dummies\" is not much better. Suffice to say that Einstein set this up as a paradox to show that QM wasn't quite up to snuff when describing the universe.Only problem is, when experimentalists like Alain Aspect (and theorists like John S. Bell) finally had laboratory set ups clever enough, and laboratory equipment sensitive enough to perform the gedanken for real, that's exactly what happened. Quantum Mechanics won out, Einstein's paradox was no paradox at all, and the universe turned to have nonlocal weirdness to it. (But, bear in mind, the speed of light was never exceeded because there was no classical signal sent, no message or communication. The information just simply was).It gets worse.   Some very clever guys figured out a method called quantum teleportation, which allows for a quantum object (like a photon or an electron, or even a molecule) to teleported from one location to another.  It's not Star Trek teleportation, where an object is scanned , and then electromagnetically beamed someplace, and then reassembled. Instead, the information about the particle is teleported rather than the particle itself.Could it work on people? Extremely doubtful. Not impossible. But highly improbable.Oh, I suppose you might be able to teleport say me, someday. A silly fictional scenario might have a recipe like... Ionize four hundred pounds of the appropriate elements into a plasma. Cooling that down to a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero to create a Bose-Einstein condensate. Deftly tease that into two two-hundred-pound entangled pieces. Ship one ultracold blob off to Jupiter in a special container that prevents any interaction with the larger universe (because if that happens the delicate entangled state collapses). Somehow take a quantum measurement of me and the entangled ultracold blob left behind (probably involving laser beams and giant magnets). Send off a radio signal with the quantum information to Jupiter, to be received by the other entangled piece. And poof! I appear on Jupiter (or better still, in some orbiting laboratory).Problem with all this? If you don't do the measurement correctly at either end, I'm toast. Another problem?  The process of measurement means I have to die, utterly destroyed, gone, finished, kaput, which opens up legal and philosophical issues for the me on Jupiter (should I make it).So.... not likely. Although practical applications run the gamut from unbreakable message encryption to ultrafast quantum computers, and who knows what else.So, now the most astounding thing about all this is the recent news that there may be a time travel version of entanglement.  Well, not exactly time travel, as it is only into the future, which we travel into anyway. But two theorists from Australia's University of Queensland have proposed an teleportation scheme that allows quantum information to be sent from one detector in the past to one in the future, while never passing through the interval in between. In other words, the intervening time is skipped over.This, quite frankly, just completely blows me away.Applications, if any? Beaming energy into the future? Manipulation of the vacuum to manipulate/store information? Dude, it's all really wild stuff!"},
{"title": "A Narrow Vision", "date": "Wednesday, January 26, 2011", "text": "This may sound conceited, but I've always found engineers to be not very bright. I'm reminded of the old dialogue that goes something like this:Biochem Major #1: \"I'm not doing so well in my classes. I'm afraid I may flunk out!\"Biochem Major #2: \"Well, don't worry. You can always become a doctor\".I suspect a similar conversation occurs among physicists. \"Don't worry. You can always become an engineer\". In other words, there are elites, and then there are elites.There is the fundamental cultural stereotype: lack of a personality, no social skills, boring, no spelling skills, no language skills, doesn't work well in groups... you know, a Republican.And then, of course, there's the classic engineer joke, that goes...Q: \"How can you tell when an engineer is an extrovert?\"A: \"When he talks to you, he looks down at your shoes.\"Attributes I would include, from personal experience, would be: closet autocrat, plodding, authoritarian, rote-learner, limited imagination, relies on textbook solutions, not very playful, appalling lack of curiosity, poor planner, rigid, brittle thinker, possesses inability to tell the difference between 'complex' and 'complicated' (i.e. overengineers things, i.e. generally makes the solution 10 times more complicated than it needs to be), overly fond of \"Red X\" diagnoses (i.e. finger pointing diagnostic method,  i.e. \"Well, there's your problem. Right there!\"), and, most tellingly, is possessed of a limited and narrow vision when it comes to anticipating and recognizing future problems, opportunities, and applications. You know... a Republican.Is this unfair? Probably, but so what? I've actually only encountered perhaps two or three engineers who did not fit comfortably in that mold. One is my older brother, and the other is, or was, the director of the Large Neutron Source at Argonne National Laboratories. The problem with them is, both of them have extensive physics backgrounds and have worked around too many physicists.So... what?  I came across a classic engineering type demonstrating a narrow vision with a piece called \"Thoughts on the Kinect hacks and iPad hacks\". His point is that apparently open source versions of the controlling software are a waste of time because 1) they probably cannot be monetized, and 2) the \"pros\"  already have well written and structured games for Kinect on the Xbox.Okay, let me back up a bit. What the heck is Kinect? Actually, I'm not that familiar with it as I don't play video games, but basically, it is a motion and gesture capture, face and voice recognition system that allows people to play video games using their bodies as the controller. Ah, well, here, just view the embeddence:The little Kinect box has cameras and microphones and lasers in it that can direct the action in the video game. The real thing, the important thing here, is the software that can interpret people. A protocol that can convert our speech, facial and body gestures, nonverbal posture, you name it, into zeroes and ones.So, back to our bonehead engineer. I think that, with 1) he expresses a symptom of the fucked-up Libertarian disease. Why explore something if you won't make any money at it? In other words, if it's not self-serving, it's not worth the effort.More importantly, he seems to think that the one and only purpose of Kinect is to play video games. What a narrow vision. My understanding is the whole point of creating an open-source software is not to explore the many applications with respect to video games, but to explore PERIOD.What can be done with this stuff? Right off the top of my head, in the same way that I talked about the real (big money) market for exo-skeleton mobile armor, is to help people with disabilities. Or new art forms, new interactive visual or sculptural forms or for dance. A super cheap motion capture to open up CGI TV shows and motion pictures. A way to produce anthology shows with nothing but a green screen and actors, and your prop budget is confined to the time and electricity and brain power to do things on a PC or a Mac. Space exploration. Remote surgery. Remote piloting. Remote anything.I expect I'm not even close to the out of left field applications on this."},

I'll keep it short for you warm weather types.-2 Degrees Fahrenheit this morning, with a windchill of -29F. And this has been a mild Chicago winter.  If memory serves, we usually get about two weeks of -10 to -20 degree weather for one to two weeks. I think my personal best is around -35 degrees. But you know, when you get down that low it really doesn't fucking matter. Cold is cold.Northern Hemisphere WinterI'd like to operate under the fiction that, being a Northern European type, I'm cold adapted and it doesn't bug me. But no, it ain't so. No, I am not cold adapted the way, say an Inuit or a Yakut is, but I can handle it. I even enjoy it. Then again, it's not torture the way it is for some of my tropical origin acquaintances, who just - do - not - like - winter. The same way that I really don't like temperatures above around 80F - unless there's a pool and a gin and tonic nearby.Layering. That's what it's all about. That -35 degree day, I 'll bet I had nine layers of clothes on, and I was stupid cold by the time I got in. Literally. The cold sucked about a good thirty IQ points out of me. It was a chore to turn on the TV. Harder still to watch. That's fucking stupid cold.I love winter.P.S. It's not an anniversary or anything, but speaking of cold, I'm reminded of the three big blizzards I've been in. They were all in January. The first one, the biggest one, was the Blizzard of 1967. People in Chicago talk about the Blizzard of 1978, but they don't know shit. '67 was the one to be in. I was ten years old, over in NW Indiana. Which means, after Chicago got 22 inches of snow in one day, we got two more days of 22 inches of snow courtesy of the lake effect. It was Donner Pass time for Hoosiers. Of course, being all of ten, I just remember digging tunnels into snowdrifts and sledding off the roof. It was fucking great.The Blizzard of 1978 I missed out on, being in college down in Bloomington, IN.The Blizzard of 1979, I happened to be one the road heading back home with my brother Eric in that one. There is a stretch of Interstate-65 which happens to accumulate every wind thrown drift from the west all the way out to Nebraska. It's guaranteed to be closed in practically every storm. And we managed to hit that section just as the jaws of the giant fucking Frost-Fenris wolf of that storm clamped down shut and solid on Indiana. We were driving my brother's rusted out piece-of-shit 1971 black Ford F150 pickup truck whose name was Elvis. My brother had replaced so much of the body with rivetted sheet metal that it looked like a WWII B-17 bomber. I think it took us about three hours to go 30 miles, and when we got home (I've no idea why we came back home), our father shook his head and muttered \"...dumbasses\"."},
{"title": "\"A Small World To Live On, A Big Universe To Die In\"- part 2", "date": "Wednesday, January 19, 2011", "text": "In the prior essay, I complained about the inadequate thinking behind the execrable plot of the movie Avatar. However, I think my objections need to be more fleshed out, and so - apologies in advance - I'm going to have to go geek on you.Living in space has been covered by so many scientists and science fiction authors, that I wonder if it is really necessary to expound upon the problems. But the fact is I haven't covered it, so here goes.Every portrayal we have had of the future of people in space is terribly flawed in this respect: it's always viewed as ultimately planet dependent, the same way surface going ships on Earth are land dependent. But the fact of the matter is to live in space for even a brief period of time requires that you plan on living there permanently. In other words, the only viable form of space travel is going to require that you can exist out there all on your lonesome, with the tools and techniques and resources to pretty much recreate everything you are ever going to need to live out there.More to the point, every bad science fantasy movie involving aliens invading the Earth to gain a resource such as fresh water is stupid from the start. If you can travel from star to star (or planet to planet) to invade a world, you can darn well extract what you need from asteroids, or comets, or uninhabited worlds, or even the gas and dust and solar winds around you. You don't need to bother fighting some pesky monkey people (or big blue cat people) for that resource you want. In fact, if you can't get what you need from the vast resources floating out in space, your space journey is pretty much fucked from the get-go.If you wish to call yourself any kind of spacefaring civilization, you pretty much have to make yourself planet independent. You have to take care of the Three Ps: Power, Propulsion, and uh, Semi-Self-Contained Sustainable Habitat (Place). Power, duh, because you need energy to run shit. Propulsion, duh, because you need to move around. But you can't do that in some sealed coffee can with some  grow lights and a hydroponic rack of pond scum and sea monkeys to recycle your bad breath and poo. You need a biosphere. (I'm assuming you need one even if you have a magical faster than light star drive that can poot you around to pretty much anywhere like in your standard space fantasy scenario). You need a biosphere. An artificial ecology. And a means to replenish it (because even the Earth is not self-contained). You need an extraction technology that can resupply just about anything within your biosphere. There's just no way around it. If humans ever head out, we are going to be like hermit crabs - hauling all the shit (ALL the shit) we need around with us to survive. And hauling all the shit we need (think about it, mining, smelting, refining, manufacturing, recycling, disposal, repurposing, basically everything that a civilization does) to keep things going.And not only don't we know what we need, we don't even know what we need to need. The one time we tried to create an artificial environment (Biosphere II), it turned into a badly planned, badly mismanaged, awful, dystopian cult-fetish of a joke - you'd have thought the whole thing had been conceived and run by libertarians, it was that fucked up.Hey, it's probably just as well we didn't just blithely send 'em all off to Mars and then wonder what went wrong, huh?More importantly, the Biosphere II project was not realistic in making the demand that it be self-contained. Of course you're going to forget something from your grocery list. Of course you are going to run out of some things. Of course your tin can is going to leak. Of course extra air, water, soil, metals, volatiles, you name it, can't be carried along. You are going to need to be able to get that shit from your surrounding environment somehow. It's not cheating if you have to go outside to get what you need. It's common sense to have the ability to do that.So, space faring civilizations, it's not going to be a romantic 19th century Star Trek vision of isolated sailing ships zooming between the stars. You're going to have to take your whole fucking civilization around with you."},
{"title": "\"A Small World To Live On, A Big Universe To Die In\"", "date": "Tuesday, January 18, 2011", "text": "If we Earthoids had interstellar travel, and we could afford it (or I was able to afford it), I'd do it in a heartbeat. And being, I think, a fairly realistic individual, the title of this essay would be my motto, my credo, my weltanschauung. It's a paraphrase of being a citizen of Portugal during their age of maritime exploration, and I like it. It provides just the right amount of deadpan humor coupled with a healthy respect for a wonderfully, fantastically, amazingly deadly beautiful world - world, hell, existence - we live in.In other words, the title is a lot better than my first choice, which was \"Avatar Really Did Suck\". Yes, dearies. I saw the movie Avatar over the weekend. I checked it out for free from the library, and boy did it suck.Now, what exactly sucked about it? Granted, special effects fantastic. Didn't get the whole immersive 3-D experience on the small TV screen, but didn't need to. I got it. Why, then did I think it sucked? Oh, two things. Plot and characters. The movie could have used both.Now, there are some fairly intelligent critiques of the movie out there. Here's an in-depth one that may be a bit too nitpicky, a little too geeky, but makes a lot of valid points: \"6 Reasons Avatar Sucked\", if you want to read it. Like I say, intelligent critiques of the movie exist.This ain't gonna be one of them.More My Kind of Cat WomanSo, the movie was boring, okay? About an hour into the movie, I'm looking at my watch, thinking \"Geez, this is a long movie! I wonder when Jake is gonna bone the big blue cat woman with the nice boobs?\" The big blue smurfy looking cat woman with nice boobs. You think Cameron has some weird fetish going on? Likes the Furry subculture or a variant thereupon? Or maybe one of those weird German diaper fetishes?  Fantasizes about some big momma changing out the load in his pants? Cleaning the soilage from between his hairy buttcheeks?Okay, sorry about that.So, Cameron does the usual things to manipulate your emotions. Boy meets girl. Boy does girl. Boy turns out to have always been a dick. Girl forgives him. Boy kills one-dimensional evil (pronounced eee-vill) villian in protracted fights where the movie is going to use every action convolution to make it seem that it's not entirely certain that the good guys are gonna win. Yawn.No really, I yawned during the big climactic action scene. Maybe I should have gone for the immersive 3-D experience. Maybe that would helped.Okay, picking of nits. I am always willing to suspend disbelief for a movie. That is, after all, the central premise of any fictive experience. And I also recognize that Avatar was not science fiction. It was an action movie posing as space fantasy. It was fantasy. And as fantasy, they only restriction placed upon the movie is that it be internally consistent. Not credible, but consistent. Well, no, the other restriction is that it also be entertaining as well.So, let's present the scenario. Humanity develops space travel. Not just any kind of space travel. Travel between the stars, which, I don't care how fantastically magical you get, is super-expensive and energy hungry. Which means humanity has not only harnessed energies vaster than anything today, but  has learned to live and thrive without need of a planet. Which means they can live basically any freaking where in the universe without despoiling a single fucking planet. So upon discovering a planet with the most precious thing of all, life, alien life, intelligent life, humanity hires a bunch of half-wits to fucking strip mine the shit out of it. Is this something we can reasonably expect? No, it is an implausible plot device, a very bad jury rigging to generate some drama. It.. it sucks as a plot. I... I've run out of all enthusiasm now to continue about just how fucking stupid this all is. It... it just sucks. Period.  Now, I'm sure there are people out there who freaking loved this movie, and if they ever read this essay, will say, in a very sour, kind of annoyingly nasal vice, \"Well, I suppose you could have done better. Why don't YOU create a billion-dollar-profit movie blockbuster\".The only logical response to that is...Hey, I don't have to be a world class chef to know when my hamburger tastes like shit."},
{"title": "An All-American Fairy Tale", "date": "Thursday, January 13, 2011", "text": "The Wizard of OZ is one of the very few shared experiences that unite Americans as a culture. Whether you've only seen the movie, or read the book as well, hardly matters. The experience and enjoyment of it is universal, and transcends pretty much any categorical barrier within our society that you choose to erect.It is a fairy tale, but it is a distinctly American fairy tale. It stars an ordinary little girl from an unremarkable portion of the country. Like the promise of the American Dream, its a journey that could happen to anyone.L Frank Baum, who wrote the book, took great pains to avoid any fearsome moralizing or frightful ethical consequences. But still and all, given that it is a fairy tale, there is some scary shit in there: murder, bloodshed, treachery, threatening skywriting. The movie was toned down considerably, but even so, there is still scary shit in the movie. The fantastic performance of Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West alone has made generations of children cry. Not to mention the tornadoes in Kansas, or the flying monkeys, or the more psychological terror of Dorothy waiting for the hourglass to run out.So, despite all these attempts to make the experience \"to pleasure children of today\", and not provide any type of moral for the story, there is one, and it is a distinctly American, in the sense of anarcho-capitalist altar worship, which is simply this:Caveat Emptor. Let the buyer beware. Now, why would I say that? Consider. A con-man, an Omaha huckster, posing as a great and powerful wizard, recognizes that a rube who has already shown homicidal tendencies (albeit manslaughter, but still..) may be just the pawn to get rid of a very magically real threat, in the form of the wicked witch. He makes false promises to fool them in engaging in a suicide mission. When they comply, and are successful, it turns out he was never in a position to help them. He is a fraud, a fake, a phony.He's a humbug, and what a cute and harmless word to use. Not bogus piece of shit. Not a motherfucking liar. Not a cocksucking cheat, not a shyster, not a quack, not a fucking weasel dick rat fuck scumbag. No, he's a humbug. He's not a very bad man. Don't wag your finger in his face! He's a very good man, just a... a bad wizard.Yeah, well, never give a sucker an even break. Never smarten up a chump. Should have read the fine print before you signed the dotted line. It's your own damn fault that you bought into my line of shit. Etc.Caveat emptor. Not, \"there's no place like home\", or \"you had it in you all along\", or even \"can do\" American spirit. Just a oopsie! Did I do dat? Ah, well, you all should have known better! You learned a valuable lesson! Bad shit happens to good people. Not everyone is a nice person.So, the point of this? Well, watch out for hucksters. People who set your BS detector off, or in my case, pegs it right to the maximum limit.People like Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin, self-serving right wing assholes who scurry under rocks the minute the wind they sowed comes back as a whirlwind, in the form of impressionable loons with semi-automatic pistols. Am I suggesting that their hateful and divisive rhetoric, designed to scare the piss out of already insecure and timid Americans, was the prime motive behind a lunatic's spree killing? No.But it sure didn't help."},

Our oldest kiln is Albert, who is kept out-of-doors. He had a roof fall on him from a torrential rain twenty years ago. We don't worry about Albert.My Brick Repair with tools and shitWorking on Fred required almost all of my custodial superpowers. I was electrician, bricklayer, machinist, and sheet-metal worker. Fred's quite decrepit, in need of an overhaul for some time now. Most of the insulation on his wires are burned off, which is not good, not good at all. And two of his relays went kaput. And he needed a new controller. And his heating elements were pretty much fried. And the door was hanging slant on its hinges. And his fire brick was falling apart. And the door seal, the tadpole gasket (refractory cloth and rope whose cross-section looks like a tadpole) was crumbling into dust. The metal stays keeping the gasket in place had screws that would not come out. Or rather, the screw heads would come off, but not the rest of the screws. So, I had to drill and tap the holes for new screws to hold the gasket in place. Fred needed a lot of work.My Brick Repair and Cement Patch JobIn his heyday, Fred could easily cook a whole family and their pets to a loose fine powder in about twelve hours, if you needed a crematorium in a hurry. And... you could bisque a village-sized funeral urn afterwards. Sorry for the grisly examples, but now you got the idea that Fred's a big boy.The Inside of FredI'm not sure where the tradition of giving kilns names comes from. My understanding is that they are generally named after the manufacturer, but the fact as to why they are anthropomorphized is, well, I don't know.We have names for other pieces of equipment. We have a mustard colored band saw that could cut up a cow named Col. Mustard. We have a big blue vortex vacuum box in the woodshop named Babe (after Paul Bunyan's big blue ox). We have a drill press named Ollie, and a reciprocating sander named Sandy. We have two metal cutting horizontal bandsaws named Bart and Lisa. We have a giant metal cutting chop saw named Homer. We don't have anything named Marge, yet.Fred is fixed and ready!I've never named the two foundry furnaces I use outside. Perhaps because they don't have much in the way of personality. Perhaps I should name them Thing One and Thing Two."},
{"title": "It's the Future!", "date": "Tuesday, January 4, 2011", "text": "Well, here we are in 2011. As far as I'm concerned, the Future began around 1974. I say that because that was the year I was introduced to touch sensitive control buttons on a friend's older brother's stereo turntable.Yes, a turntable is something you play records on. A record is a plastic disc with a spiral groove in it. You put the record on the turntable, and it rotates. The turntable has a needle stylus that rides on the spiral groove, and little bumps and ridges in the groove translate into noise that you can listen to called music. This is, I think, where the term \"groovy\" comes from. So, you might think that this is all super fucking primitive, but it is the setup aboard the Voyager space probes. One each of mankind's first interstellar space probes, there is a golden record and a stylus, and instructions to aliens as to how to operate this so they can watch and listen to sounds and images from the planet Earth.Anyway,  so instead of having chunky, clunky push buttons for controls, this turntable had little concentric metal circle controls with a light underneath them on the front panel. All you did was touch the circle control with your finger and the little light went on or off, and the turntable rotated, or stopped rotating, a round lazy susan pedestal on an axis. It was fucking cool as hell, and it was definitely something I had never seen before. Which made it all new, and therefore, from the future.I happened to see evidence of travel into the future over the holidays at my mother's house. On the dining room table, my brother had placed an iPhone. Next to it was my mother's cell phone, which she had had since, oh, say, 1999 or so. The cell phone was actually smaller than the iPhone, but it had a push button numeric keypad and a very small liquid crystal display for showing the phone number of whomever you were calling, or who was calling you. The iPhone was just a thick black pad with a flat plastic surface on one side. If I didn't know what it was, I'd have never guessed that the surface was actually a screen. If I had fiddled with it, I'd have finally noticed a button which turned it on. And then you did everything through a touch screen interface, which, had I seen al this in 1974, probably would have made me shit my pants.Well, actually, that's not the point. The point is, there was ten years, right there on the table. From cell phone, to wearable computer, in ten years. There was travel into the future.Now, I actually don't think that we are seeing an unending acceleration of technology, ala Ray Kurzweil's wet little dream. I think that there are plateaus and limits and boundaries and nonlinear logistic curves when it comes to social and technological progress. In fact, even progress is somewhat delusional, as there can be (and have been) reverses. Loss of technology or craft or knowledge, as when someone keeps a secret to themselves, and it dies with them. Or the rediscovery of a technique or skill lost to common knowledge. And, yes, second derivatives are important. (An analogy from the calculus, the first derivative being velocity, the rate of change of a measure of distance over a measure of time, and then the second derivative being the change of that change, or the change of velocity over time, which is acceleration). Yes, second derivatives are important, and yet we ignore the even more important third derivative, which is the acceleration of acceleration, or as the engineers like to call it, shock.The shock of the new. That's when you know you are in the future. Or that's what did it for me.So, I wasn't that shocked looking at the cellphone/iPhone juxtaposition. Nor was watching my nephews play video games with just their bodies using the creepy Kinect controller. These were all trends that had been anticipated. Heck, I predicted them long before they existed, and that is, believe me,  no great feat. Nevertheless, I recognize them as being part and parcel of living in my future.What amazing future stuff exists now that makes me shit my pants? Actually, nothing comes to mind. Have I just become jaded? Have I become inured to all the futuristic advertising, all the expectations of continued and unremitting progress? I don't think so. But if I do think of something, I'll let you all know.Oh, Happy e-vil-Eens. Glad the Fucking Oh-ohs are over."},
{"title": "\"Dangerous Creatures Booted From Hoosier Town\"", "date": "Monday, December 27, 2010", "text": "Back home for the holidays. I think I've mentioned that I grew up in Valparaiso, Indiana. If I haven't, well, that 's where I'm from. Growing up there, it's a small town. Even now, I think there's only about 30,000 people here, which makes it a small town.Growing up in Northwest Indiana is kind of a schizophrenic experience. You've got the heavy metal industries just a few miles west of us, residing in Gary, Hammond, and East Chicago. And just a few miles east of that is the lush bucolic countryside where I was raised. As a result, I'm probably in exceptionally better health, contaminant wise, than most US citizens. True, there was a witch's brew of volatiles and heavy minerals that we were occasionally dosed with on the westerly breezes, but nothing compared to most city dwellers.And then, given the fact that I was raised on milk from dairy cows at a local farm, with local beef and produce, living in a (then small) suburban neighborhood surrounded by woods, swamp, lakes, family farms, drank incredibly clean fossil glacier water from Lake Michigan, lived in a dead center middle class lifestyle with a minimum stress level in small town America, with an idyllic Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn childhood, I'm probably one of the most pampered, privileged, sleek, soft, stupid, happy people you could ever hope to be.I think it shows. I seem to be younger looking than most people my age, or at least younger acting, and I have to chalk that up to having a really soft life - but not too soft. I recognize my fortune, obviously take it way too much for granted, and am finally appreciative for just how fucking LUCKY I've been. It could have gone South in ten thousand hideous ways, or four billion hideous ways, if you look at life statistics for most of the world.So, after dealing with small, stunted, bitterly sour, withered, ruinously toxified city folk, its nice to come back to TV Land. It really is TV Land here. No difficult choices. No major crimes. Looking through the local news, its all DUIs and possession of controlled substances. Occasionally, you will see a news item like \"Home Invader Eats Food, Does Dishes. (That one actually happened).So today I am greeted with the following news item in the local paper:\"Dangerous Animal Statute ApprovedLaporte outlaws monkeys, baboons, poisonous snakes, piranha, and sharks\"I see you guys hangin' around town.

{"title": "Salvia Divinorum", "date": "Thursday, December 23, 2010", "text": "The Beginning of Louis Wain's Escape From RealityThe best toy any kid could want for Christmas is their brain. Remember kids, it's not the drug, it's what your brain does with the drug, because, when you get right down to it, it was all in your head to begin with. So... to get the experience, you don't really need the drug, right?Okay, all preaching about \"natural\" highs aside, I found an interesting article on Salvia Divinorum. This particular phenomenon I have paid only passing interest to in the last few years. I've heard the art children at the college talk about it. Had one or two passing acquaintances mention it. But, seeing as my experimentation phase was some thirty years ago, I didn't pay too much attention to it. What? You are shocked that I did drugs? But I came of age in the 1970s. That's when all that shit went mainstream. At least in my uptight white neighborhood. One minute, I'm a jock, running track and field, swimming, playing sports, getting good grades. The next, I'm a doper, but, oh wait, I was still playing sports and getting good grades. (Sorry, no decent into madness melodrama for you). But suddenly practically everybody was trying out the drugs. Is that really such a shock?Nevertheless,  don't count out coincidences. A few intrusions into your consciousness makes it just that. When the occurrences start to cue up is when the idea of synchronicity starts to kick in. Hmmmm......So, a colleague gave me a description. Last summer he had a chance to smoke some salvia. He described it as the most intense hallucinatory experience ever. Of, soon after inhaling, his entire body turning into quicksilver, like the Silver Surfer, and becoming \"the big magnet in the stereo speaker of the Universe - the woofer\". And then just as suddenly, it was over - save for a \"pleasant afterglow\". Then another colleague mentions her experience, about how \"it was like a million needles being pushed into my skin... but they were really good needles\". Well, ah, ha ha, ooh-kay!Like I said, I had my fair share of that, although never like that, never at all like that. But, you know, been there done that. But then there's that article. Here's a quote:Johnson and his colleagues recruited four volunteers who had used hallucinogens such as LSD or psilocybin in the past. Over 20 sessions, the participants inhaled various doses of highly purified salvinorin A or a placebo while researchers monitored their vital signs and queried them about their experiences.The effects of the salvinorin A were remarkably strong, consistent and fast-acting, peaking about two minutes after inhalation, and nearly disappearing by 20 minutes.As doses increased across sessions, volunteers reported stronger and stronger hallucinations, which included cartoonlike images, revisiting childhood memories and contact with an entity. “With this drug, at its peak intensity, people describe popping out and visiting a completely different world. Some people say it seems like another dimension or maybe the spirit world,” Johnson says. “They report these very profound experiences in these highly altered states of consciousness.”Cartoonlike images? Entering another dimension? Transports you to an alternate reality? I don't think I've EVER been to that intersection in my brain. Gotta admit, sounds intriguing. Actually, sounds pretty damn exciting. Another dimension? There's something about that phrase, that, well, I'll be honest, makes me want to smoke the stuff!Plus, the study found that salvia is non-addictive, has no apparent health effects,  and, and, allows you to enter another dimension? My fears have been assuaged, and I'm ready!Wow! Thanks, informative online science magazine article!"},
{"title": "Troubleshooting", "date": "Wednesday, December 22, 2010", "text": "I'm sure I'll catch grief from chess mavens, but I think chess is a stupid game.Oh, it's got clever moves, and strategic and tactical thinking, and planning, and all that good mental stuff that we are all supposed to value. However, it also consists, as I am taken to understand, in a lot of rote memorization of the \"correct\" moves, of trolling through a planning space of moves, of tedious deduction and trial and error, and not so much creative problem solving, not so much innovation or puzzle solving. Small wonder that computers can play chess so well. But that's not why it is stupid.Unless the opponents are not horribly mismatched, the play almost always ends up with a lot of carnage, a brute force slugfest, a meat grinder of a game. A field of battle riddled with corpses. A war of attrition. Pyrrhic victories. In short, a stupid way to fight a war.Granted, I may be biased as I've always sucked at chess. On the other hand, I've always been slightly above average when it came to the game of Go. Ah, now there's a game that requires some creative thinking. Not only forward planning kind of thinking, but a global scope, a big picture puzzle, a sideways associational type of thinking, with not so much a deductive search and elimination of less than optimal moves as opposed to lightning strike moments. Eureka moments. Or, as the Japanese say, when they are unfortunate to be on the loosing side of such an event \"ear-reddening moments\". I've experienced both sides of that. Even though I may have been on the losing side of that moment, the flash of insight that occurs when I recognize that the placement of a single stone has wrecked everything is still a rather exhilarating feeling.In short, Go is a much more complex, much more interesting game than chess.For most of my adult life, when I had a real job, my job title was that troubleshooter. Actually, more like glorified janitor, tending code that is now hysterically obsolete, on computers that are now anchor chains and bicycle parts in China. But that was basically what I did. Solve problems.Actually, not so much trouble shooting, which usually has a more hardware than software connotation. And it also kind of implies a chesslike approach to problems - isolating a problem source by a tedious process of elimination.Puzzle solving, debugging then, was more of what I did. The logical deduction technique was my backup plan, and I was not necessarily that good at it.Good thing I was very good at intuitive solutions. It really was more about knowing who was the idiot that coded the program, or who was the last idiot who modified it. (Yes, dearies, you may think computer programmers are on the high side of the bell curve, but my experience was that they were, uh, not so smart. Or maybe it was me who was a little smarter, although, I can remember on one occasion rewriting a truly brilliant program authored by a very clever young man. I had to. It was too clever, and I knew, in the future, that it would be maintained by fucking idiots who would not have the first clue as to what the code did). In fact, much of what I did required more like inference, imagination, associations, a little zenlike subconscious processing, a little backburner thinking, and then, lightning strike. Not only to find the problem, but to come up with a clever hack to fix the problem without creating new ones. Thinking back, I think a lot of my success stemmed from the fact that I maintained a casual, even cavalier, attitude in the midst of a crisis. A sense of humor, more than anything, was probably the reason for my successes. My brain was relaxed in playful mood, and ready for that dopamine reward of the \"Aha!\" moment.Now, there is some evidence that comedy and problem solving go hand in hand.And let's face it, there's room for comedy in a game of Go, not so much in chess, I think."},

It's inextricably linked to film noir, but I think you have to credit Otto Preminger (trivia note: Mister Freeze on the Batman TV series) for its genesis. Granted, he didn't write the music, but his city dramas of the late 1950s certainly provided the vehicle for it. That's just for starters. The songs extend into the comic book TV era of the 1960s, with theme songs for shows like Mission Impossible, Man from U.N.C.L.E., the James Bond films.You had composers like Count Basie,  Henry Mancini, Quincy Jones, John Barry, Lalo, Schifrin, David Amram, Elmer Bernstein. Songs like Arabesque, Frankie Machine, Peter Gunn...Who cannot listen to Peter Gunn as a personal soundtrack and not strut down the street shouldering aside grandmas and small children, feeling like a complete hardass?Speaking of which, the reason I've been off the air lately is I've lost my home internet service provider. I've been piggybacking off an unsecured wireless router of one of my neighbors for the past three years. They finally secured their router, and wouldn't you know it, it's the Albanians.Oh, fucking hell, the Albanians.We've had a growing colony of them here in my shitbox apartment complex. At first it was one family whom I thought was French, don't ask me why. Maybe it was the two plump but incredibly sexy dark-eyed daughters that just seemed to have an aura of sexy Frenchiness about them. But soon enough, more families moved in, until there were a good two dozen of them. All lean, hard-looking, hungry, lupine men, and lovely women with raven black hair and alabaster skin. And all of them driving BMWs and Mercedes. How can they afford those kinds of vehicles, unless...I'm thinking of the movie taken, when Liam Neeson is informed that his daughter is being held by the Albanians \"not even the Russian mob will mess with them\". And, given that the Albanian mob has a reputation for being especially violent and unpredictable, I'm hoping they don't find out I've been stealing internet access through them. Because if they did, I've a feeling I'd soon be typing out this electronic journal with prosthetic hooks.But nah, they're just families. I see them out there, being gentle with their children, hugging and kissing each other on the cheeks when the clans get together. And they wave and say \"Hi\" to me, when I see them.Nah, nothing to worry about."},

So let it be written. So let it be done.My understanding is that - starting with December 20th, 2010, South Carolina's secession from the Union - that the sesquicentennial anniversary of the Civil War is to be celebrated with varying degrees of asshabberdashery and dipshittery.Dueling Banjos from \"Deliverance\"South Carolina always struck me as the distilled and concentrated essence of the southern stereotype: the Deliverance Banjo Boy, the halfwit inbred cousin kept in the attic or the cellar, the bugfuck ignant, close-set-eyed, gappy-toothed, flatheaded, stoop-shouldered, undernourished, ill-clothed, pig-fucking, parasite-infested, subhuman, albino CHUD blinking stupidly in the light of day. And some would argue that's probably being generous. Well... well, no. I'm sure they are very nice folk once you spend time with them. Once you get past the fact that they elect silly little cocksuckers like Jim DeMint to the Senate (ah, but Kentucky's got 'em beat!). Still and all, celebrating the advent of the Confederacy strikes me about the same as celebrating the time your Aunt Mable developed that strawberry growth on her face that sprouted ugly looking boar bristle hair and then metastasized into a disfiguring condition that eventually slowly and painfully killed her. In other words, it wasn't exactly a good occasion.Don't get me wrong. This is part of our history as a nation. We cannot ignore it, nor can we afford to look at it with anything other than clear eyes and honest admissions. It's a Greek Tragedy in capital letters. And even though my families were still back in the Old Country having their faces shoved in shit-turned mud by local aristocrats, I, by mere presence as a contemporary citizen enjoying the fruits of liberty share no small responsibility in - well, I'm not entirely sure. National guilt? Shame? Something.Well, let me get to the fucking point. What I DON'T want to see celebrated is some kind of horse-shit from the State's Rights crowd down South or elsewhere. The idea that the Civil War was all about state's rights is just such pure and unmitigated horse-shit that I am surprised anyone who holds this opinion is sane or smart enough to hold a steady job. Really, these cocksuckers should be shipped back to whatever shithole in Europe they sprouted from, and room made in the US for decent and more deserving citizens from India or Africa or some other less fortunate place. Many in the South would prefer that this not be about slavery, that the war was never about slavery. Ignore, please the fact that in the Confederate Constitution, the word \"slave\" is used TEN TIMES! (In the original, in the REAL Constitution, the one time the word \"slave\" comes close to being used: Article 1 Section 2, the 3/5ths compromise, the Founding Fathers are either too cowardly or considered it in bad taste to refer to slaves and so use the weasel phrase \"other Persons\"). It was never about States Rights. Anyone who tells you that is a fucking liar.I just as soon these state's rights buffoons do us all a favor and find some embarrassingly public way to fuck off and die in a slow and painful manner, you know, visibly and audibly shit their pants, fall over, squeal like a pig, drop stone dead and become extinct like the reptiles they are.(Was that..? Was that over the top? No matter).But of course, they ARE going to celebrate. And therefore, I think other anniversaries of other incompetent fuckups should be pooled together for a celebration. And it just so happens, by coincidence, that 2011 provides that.So, along with the rise of the Confederacy, I celebrate other great fuckheads: the military administration of the Empire of Japan (1941); L. Ron Hubbard (born 1911); Jim Jones, Jonestown (born 1931); the Deutsches Kaiserreich (1871); many, many, many others."},

They really aren't interested in the Vingean Singularity. Vernor Vinge, who provided the  modern definition and popularization of the technological acceleration event that results in an inability to predict more than twenty minutes into the future, more than anything set this up as a literary gauntlet, flung down to writers as a challenge. \"All bets are off\", said Vinge, \"so place your bets\". Much as a challenge to himself more than anything. This Singularity is, I think, not the Singularity people are interested in. Vinge's Singularity is a little scary, not at all a sure thing, perhaps even an extinction event for humanity. A Strangelovian version of the happy ending.They are more interested in the Kurzweilian Singularity. This is the version where Ray Kurzweil pins his hopes on a trickle down version of intelligence, where humanity's boat is floated with the rising tide, where people are transcended. This is Extropianism. Transhumanism. The wildly optimistic vision that we all, or at least some fortunate few, get to become angels and demons, gods, titans, mythical creatures, perhaps even the Godhead itself.Another variant of this is hoping the aliens come visit. With a qualifier, of course, benevolent aliens. Ready to share their superior wisdom and technology. The ending of war, disease, poverty, hunger, want. The standard Star Trek Socialist Fantasy.It is, in short, a diaper fetish.Infantilism. Regression. Lolling about in the crib. Fed pap. Entertained with shiny things. Coddled. Swaddled. Bathed. Buttocks wiped. Perhaps even little bellies massaged so the very effort of pooping is made... effortless.That is the reward of Paradise, is it not? The end of toil. The release of all care. Finally to rest. In sun dappled repose. With endless leisure. Supine grace. A return to the golden eternity of infancy.Ah, but in real life, we know what happens when that happens. We fucking wither, weaken, and die.True, stress and strife kill us off just as fast. But leisure and bed rest beget disgusting soft bodies and bedsores. Not good for us. Both as individuals and collectively.A La-zee-boy future is sure to wipe us out as a species. We need challenges. We need problems.If you really want a Singularity future, you better be ready for a Sisyphean one. To modify Camus' conclusion:\"One must imagine Frankenstein happy...\""},

Awkward. And after a while, your knees give out. I'm pretty much a 3-D guy now. Any studies I do, I do in clay or wax. For figures,  I'll use sticks and hot glue for the armature. Most times I'll just go with what is in my head directly. Lately, though, I've been thinking of taking pencil to paper again. Oh, I'll never be a Dürer, or or a DaVinci, or a Rembrandt, and my rationalization to compensate for that is that I am willing to sacrifice anatomical fidelity in exchange for drama (even when the characters are stiff and wooden). Regardless, I am interested again, and it boils down to correcting a student's drawing. She had been given the assignment of drawing her neighboring student and produced a portrait that basically looked like her subject, if, you know, her subject had had a cerebrovascular accident.So I fixed it for her. And that got me started. Now I want to draw things again."},
{"title": "The Failure of Fantasy", "date": "Monday, December 13, 2010", "text": "Castle Of Sin by Frank FrazettaI've always been a science fiction fan, not so much a fantasy fan. Oh, there are books I've read.Ursula K. Leguin's Earthsea series. Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian series. Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and Grey Mouser series. (Of course, it was Frank Frazetta's book cover illustrations that ensorcelled me first and foremost).L. Sprague De Camp. H.P. Lovecraft. Jack Vance. Roger Zelazny (never read the Amber series). Piers Anthony... Okay, so maybe I'm more of a fantasy fan than I realized.I've not read the Harry Potter series, but I've seen the movies - and I'll get to this in a minute.I feel that there is a distinction between science fiction and fantasy. Granted, a fantasy author can do pretty much as he or she pleases - so long as the story remains internally consistent. (Example: if the wizard hero cannot teleport across water to get off an island imprisonment in one part of the book, but then later pops across a raging river, I have to say, \"Oh, come on!\"). And, of course, there is Arthur C. Clarke's famous maxim that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. (Or my corollary, that a sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology). I think the major distinction is that, although both can be shameless vehicles of escapism, SF at least tries to be socially relevant, in the sense of exploring social themes, either in terms of impact of technology, or alternate political systems, or interpersonal relations, or psychological impact/exploration of personality and identity.Fantasy just seems to be, well, a jerk-off fantasy about medieval romanticism. I mean, take Harry Potter. Not a single gun to be found, as far as I know. No bombs. Oh, motorcycles. Motorcars. Knives. Swords, I think the occasional pole-ax. But not one gun. I mean. Voldemort? Take him out? Give me a sniper rifle and a well-hidden location. Bam! Problem solved. J.K. Rowling's first book, barely a paragraph in, and it's over. Rest of series, unnecessary. Alright, I kind of shifted sideways on that, but really, what's the point of the story? The standard villain who upsets the status quo and the hero who defeats the villain and returns everything to normal. Your standard Republican/ Teabagger daisychain.  So, you want my distinction? SF is for liberals. Fantasy is for conservatives.And in fact, what is the whole purpose of magic anyway? It certainly isn't there to improve conditions. No magic potions to cure smallpox, or AIDS. No spells to prevent a Darfur or a Bosnia. No anti-Katrina curses. Just stuff for personal enrichment and gain. And all set in a castles and dragons and horses atmosphere.Here you have a literary device pretty much primed to explore some really far out human conditions, and instead it is wasted, again and again on a Middle Ages beatoff fest. Or rather, to keep us mired in what could be considered simpler and better times. Pre-long-19th-century times. Before the dreary ugliness of Modernism reared its head.Is that what it's about? We (mistakenly) long for a better time? A time when it was hard not to keep keep from dying before the age of 30? A time when you could tell a person was a king because \"he isn't covered in shit\"? That's pretty sad for a genre."},

I haven't grown a beard  for about ten years. For a different reference, the last time I grew one, it was blonde.I informed Vicki of this, and she noted this datum with a certain skepticism.So, I went home and rummaged through the pictures, and found one of me at the tender age of 22. Yeah, that's me in the top photo.  I showed this to the children at the college, and they all had a good laugh at the hippie. I had to remind them that hippies, real hippies, existed ten years before my own youthful indiscretions, and were, in fact, their fat old grammas and grandpas now.I'm not fat.My vanity feels it necessary to point out the older version of me is not fat.That's all muscle and sinew. Okay, maybe some fat too. Alright, I'm fat - compared to that skinny little guy. But I could take him. Probably.Almost ten years ago, my younger brother lost his job at Motorola. He was in quality control, as an electrical tester, or something. Motorola, like every other consortium or collective superorganism, does not particularly care about its component parts, so long as it does not impact its own objectives of growth, profitability and pain avoidance (lawsuits, bad press, drop in share price, etc).(Indeed, my old joke about when corporations changed the name of the Personnel Department to Human Resources was: \"Why did they change the name? Its easier to justify exploiting a Resource\". Ha ha ha.)So, Motorola, like so many other corporations, took it's jobs to China. The economy sucking the way it did, thanks to St. Ronnie and the Neoliberal's efforts to make the World Safe For Business, most corporations had no choice. Maggie Thatcher once said \"Socialism works until it runs out of money\". Others counter that \"Capitalism works until it runs out of cheap labor\".(And am I starting to sound like a Marxist? Not quite yet, but give me time. By the time I reach my dotage, I plan on becoming radically insufferable, and it will be \"proletarian\" this and \"imperialist running dog\" that).At any rate, my brother and his family suffered through a long period of unemployment due partly to the fact that he was in severe denial. He was trying to get his job back - not at Motorola, but a similar job, with the same pay scale and benefits. I, on more than one occasion, tried to persuade him that, Dude, those jobs are gone. Gone for good. Fled overseas. Never to return.Finally, finally, after a nightmarish time, he landed a job. Not nearly as well paying. Requiring a much lower skill set. But it was a job.So it is, that, as a result of my brother's ordeal, I'm a bit gun-shy in reading his communications. Quite frankly, I always have a sense of dread before I open an email from him.So, guess what? His company went under right before Thanksgiving. Happy Holidays!(The bank which held the loan for the company, and was more than happy to take money from the government on the promise that they would make loans out to struggling businesses, promptly turned around and reneged on it. There's one superorganism I'd like to see violated up the backside, with some type of collective equivalent of a toxic anal probe).Needless to say, I've had a small case of anxiety going on since the announcement. I was able to help them out financially the last go around, but this time I'm struggling as well (and yes, brilliant fucking career move, Johnny, going into the art world). It's like there is a lit doorway opening onto a small, cramped, uncomfortable and not particularly well kept room in my limbic system. Didn't really need the added worry of how my brother's family is going to weather the current economic storm.Well, good news, and better than a lot of people. He got himself a new job. A job with a company that took over the distributorship from his old company. Got the job mainly on the praise from the contractor population that my brother shares this little industry he is in.Typing this right now, I'm experiencing a strange a build up of moisture on the eyes.  I guess I didn't realize how much this affected me until just now. It is a weight I didn't know was upon me, until I received the good news about his hiring. I'm not ashamed to say I've a hard time keeping the sting of tears out of the corners of my eyes in relief.So, here's wishing well to anyone out there that is going through tough times. I'm hoping my our good luck is contagious."},
{"title": "\"Kick their asses and report back to me\"", "date": "Thursday, December 9, 2010", "text": "Lewis Chess piece from the National Museums ScotlandThat's, um, that's a phrase I've heard more than once in my life. Unfortunately, much to my dislike, and given our hierarchical collective command structure of a society, it has been rephrased to \"Kiss their asses, and ...\".As I get older, as my prefrontal lobes stew and season in my own juices, I like to think that I'm developing a certain maturity that allows for just the right amount of introspection. And one of those moments of clarity is the realization that I am (or can be) remorselessly, psychotically, ruthlessly without conscience - under certain circumstances. And, if I am to be honest with myself, and no doubt a symptom of my own unique insanity, I'm a little proud of this.(Now, some will say that questioning your sanity is a sure sign that you are sane. And to that I say, fucking bullshit).I am, under the right conditions, a dangerously psychotic sociopath. I have, on more than one occasion, experienced a Berserker Moment. And I've got to tell you the memory of such unfettered rage, of quite literally Seeing Red, is one of pure and utter pleasure, perhaps something like what a cute little kitty cat or puppy dog feels when it takes down its prey.Now, just the right amount of introspection, coupled with some interesting library tidbits about Northern European, or rather Northern Barbarian, history and folkways, makes me suspect that this is just a tad bit more genetic than cultural. And since this makes me uncomfortable, its a theme worth exploring, which I probably won't do.I bring this all up because my attention was drawn to a rather alien and opposite piece of behavior, a compelling anecdote about our President to be found in Mr. Chauncey Devega's blog, We Are Respectable Negroes . Mister Devega's anecdote is as follows:Several years ago a fellow traveler and colleague of mine studied under then Professor Obama. In the latter's constitutional law class there was a very outspoken, provocative, and often wrong student that was quite disruptive as he seemed to revel in contradicting a young professor, one who was coincidentally not White. Throughout the term, Professor Obama would handle him politely and delicately, in the best professorial sense finding merit in said student's comments and redirecting the course appropriately.One day the seminar was discussing Reconstruction, the Emancipation of Black Americans, and the Equal Protection Clause. The arch-Conservative student in question suggested that African-Americans were not prepared for freedom, had not demonstrated a propensity for democracy, and would have been better off in a state of servitude until they could appreciate the fruits of liberty as taught by White people. Shocked, with students on the edge of their seats, Obama smiled, did not respond, and then once more salvaged this intentionally provocative, racially tinged, and disruptive set of assertions. Many students were stunned. The line of reasoning offered by our provocateur was both intellectually lazy and unfounded by the historical record. Obama could have destroyed this observation and the specious reasoning underlying it with little effort...what could and should have been a truly teachable moment. Instead, then Professor Obama chose to make lemonade by adding bar sugar to a noxious mix of rotten lemons.In that moment President Obama signaled to a type of too good-natured naivete, and a belief in the generosity and reasonableness of people, that is to this day vexing his presidency. I am, quite frankly, continually blown away by this behavior. Not that this behavior is alien to me. Nor do I view it as a form of laziness or cowardice. Upon more than occasion, I've recognized that this type of particular battle is not worth the effort. That the asshole in question in the above anecdote (and yes, clearly, the student vexing Obama is an insufferable asshole, and, it should be noted, not likely to be President of the United States of America, proving, in some sense, that the best form of revenge is living well).There have been more than a few moments, both on treading the debate boards of the interwebs, and in real life, when you realize that It Just Ain't Worth It. Nevertheless, there are other times when you just have to say, fuck it, savage the little weenie, destroy the chickenshit, and let him hate you for the rest of his hopefully short, squalid and miserable life. And then the inner Viking leaps with joy, and asks the flavor of the violence, short duration or long? Fast or slow? A quick rabbit punch to the pharynx? Or how about the Blood Eagle (a quaint Norwegian custom )? And if Obama had had a certain Rahm Emanuel as his teaching assistant, is there any doubt that the student would probably have suffered some type of deserved painful physical humiliation?I do not view this reaction with pride. I only note it as instinctive to a degree. As a basic drive, a compelling animal magnetism which the Will has the only option of vetoing. It is no choice, any more than an act of heroism or altruism, as it has been noted by heroes in times of emergency, a choice. It's just the thing to do.Showing restraint is a superior quality of a superior man. But, in this tawdry world, such men need men of baser metal to look after them. I, contrary to almost everyone, have more respect and admiration for Obama than before. And given the circumstances of the past two years, feel that he deserves more than a few chances. He really had no choice with the current tax deal, with the cowardly criminal hostage takers, Mitch the Bitch McConnell the Freak Half-Turtle Man, and John Boehner: Alien Escapee from the Carrot People Planet, but to put down his gun and talk to them, just like in the cop shows.For the longest time, I viewed him with a slightly jaundiced eye. I certainly did not vote for him. Rather, I voted against McNasty and the Dingbat, who I viewed then (still do, even more now) as utterly and irrevocably disastrous for our nation. I believe I will now be more charitable."},

{"title": "Question Number 5", "date": "Thursday, December 2, 2010", "text": "Tsuneaki Asai's protoplastsOn the list of origin questions, this is perhaps not so puzzling compared to others.Why are there animals?Or rather, why are there multi-cellular creatures?Life has been on Earth for three and a half thousand million years, give or take. For either two and a half, or three thousand million years, that life has been in the form of single celled creatures.The standard answer is, well, there are advantages to being a multi-cellular creature. It means you are bigger than a single celled predator, which makes it harder for you to be eaten. It means that you can glom together, share resources, communicate about the environment. For the same reason that a cell has a cell wall, producing a contained environment that it can fashion into whatever suits its chemistry best, so a multicellular creature can do the same, only bigger, with more possibilities. It means you can form a gut, and take full advantage of the things you consume. It means you can specialize your cells, so they can perform different tasks better - better than a general purpose cell. So there are all sorts of advantages.And then, it turns out, many single celled organisms tended to cooperate in communities long before multi-cellular creatures appeared. All the specialized adaptions in your cells are taken from pre-adaptive structures used by single cells. The little linkage proteins that your bones and muscles use, the molecular hooks that hold you together, the ion channels nerves use to communicate, the internal protein sequences ready to interpret self from non-self, all of these exist in single celled creatures. They are used for community relations, for cooperation, which, despite the adage about Nature being red in tooth and claw, is more often than not what life is about.So why did it take so long? Well, we are told oxygen is the key. Collagen, a very important protein that holds us all together, requires large amounts of oxygen to be made. And oxygen has not been around in large quantities for very long. Only (only, ha!) the last billion years or so.Okay, okay, so that's the standard explanation. Me? I've a different take. Have a look at this video:Did you watch it? Now what do you think?Well, look at the picture at the top. For all practical purposes, that picture might as well be a video. Not much happnin'. And then you got the video of the cats and crows. Some difference.Here's my take. The reason animals (and plants) are around is because single celled life is BORING!"},
{"title": "The Singularity - Yet AGAIN!", "date": "Wednesday, December 1, 2010", "text": "Antoni Gaudi's Cactus GeometryToday is like biting into a York Peppermint Patty.AND, we've our first sprinklings of snow on the ground, so I expect no echoes of  rejoicing from those of you who are cold-challenged. I, on the other hand, could not be more pleased, Winter is on it's way.Funny thing about the experience of a good wind chill - say, 20mph wind in an ambient temperature of 30 degrees F, thus putting it around zero - is that there is no one good word for the somatic experience of it. In fact, I would be hard pressed to find a worthwhile description for an intense cold. It's not exactly pain. Although there are moments when exposed parts experience a kind of pain, but they quickly get numbed, or are reinforced by blood pumped from the toasty core of my body. It's a discomfort, for sure, but rarely a suffering. And, at least for me, there's a certain kind of pleasure, or at least an exhilaration, that goes with exposure to intense cold. But no one succinct description for the experience.I suspect, but cannot verify, that this feeling is not experienced in dreams. Or, at least, in dreams I remember about cold and snow and ice. What little memory I have of the somatic part of the dream seems to be one in a shirt-sleeve environment. I guess that my dreams are climate controlled.Speaking of dreams, I notice that the strange future dream state known as the Singularity has popped into my attention again. This time around, it comes in the form of a short essay by Cosma Shalizi  (reprinted here in toto):The Singularity has happened; we call it \"the industrial revolution\" or \"the long nineteenth century\". It was over by the close of 1918.Exponential yet basically unpredictable growth of technology, rendering long-term extrapolation impossible (even when attempted by geniuses)? Check.Massive, profoundly dis-orienting transformation in the life of humanity, extending to our ecology, mentality and social organization? Check.Annihilation of the age-old constraints of space and time? Check.Embrace of the fusion of humanity and machines? Check.Creation of vast, inhuman distributed systems of information-processing, communication and control, \"the coldest of all cold monsters\"? Check; we call them \"the self-regulating market system\" and \"modern bureaucracies\" (public or private), and they treat men and women, even those whose minds and bodies instantiate them, like straw dogs.An implacable drive on the part of those networks to expand, to entrain more and more of the world within their own sphere? Check. (\"Drive\" is the best I can do; words like \"agenda\" or \"purpose\" are too anthropomorphic, and fail to acknowledge the radical novely and strangeness of these assemblages, which are not even intelligent, as we experience intelligence, yet ceaselessly calculating.)Why, then, since the Singularity is so plainly, even intrusively, visible in our past, does science fiction persist in placing a pale mirage of it in our future? Perhaps: the owl of Minerva flies at dusk; and we are in the late afternoon, fitfully dreaming of the half-glimpsed events of the day, waiting for the stars to come out.I’ve thought along similar lines myself. I found apiece of scratch paper from around 2004 or so with notes on the Singularity - and not the Singularity as popularized by the likes of Ray Kurzweil, a one-fell-swoop life and world changing event of the future, but rather a series of steps that no one notices. Such that, in stages at least, we enter a world never before seen:\"Take 500BC, one brain could recreate all of civilization. Too small? Let’s say a hundred then. A tribe of brains can store enough of the raw tech “vital” information and act as a seed, a catalyst. The rest occurs through cleverness and trial and error. Let’s call this Singularity v1.0 (because Kurzweil don’t own it yet). And things stayed that way up to about, oh, say 1848.Why 1848? I like that date. A lot of interesting things occured. Social movements in Europe. The US is really starting to get ornery. The first scientific teaching institutions are forming. And it is, in my opinion, the beginning of the Modern Age. With the tech toolkit in a thousand peoples brains, atom bombs are inevitable. Now it takes the stored knowledge in a thousand brains (a corporation? a consortia?) to get us back from the brink. Singularity v2.0What next? Well, computers helped. Shall we say 1937, with a nod to Johnny von Neumann? Now, how many, a million? Ten million? That’s a nation of necessary brains. Singularity v3.0.And version 4.0? It probably already happened, we've just been too busy trying to catch up to notice.\"Great minds think alike? I'm no Shalizi, but I am rather pleased with myself.That will change soon enough."},
{"title": "The Michigan Confederacy", "date": "Tuesday, November 30, 2010", "text": "North America in 1986, from the Gallatin DivergenceI just can't seem to let this piece of alternate history alone. It's been stewing in my brain after my initial objection to the childish libertopian vision of an essay or two ago . It would seem that the formation of a confederacy of American Indians smack dab in the middle of the country is improbable in the extreme, but certainly no more ridiculous than the idea that Albert Gallatin could convince Washington's militia to side with the Whiskey Rebellion farmers, or that consequently George Washington himself would be executed. and yet, here I am thinking about it.I'd much rather write about the Vivaldi Divergence, which, let's face it, would be a much, much more interesting alternate history. That would have occurred had the brothers Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi, in 1291, having set sail from Genoa to find a route to India, had stumbled upon North America. The brothers and their Majorcan crew, raving from starvation and thirst, barely recognizable as human, nursed back to health by Waccamaw natives. And then, of course, the Great Dying starts, as the natives succumb to smallpox, measles, influenza, bubonic and pneumonic plagues, mow down the peoples, spreading across the continent, and then southwards through South America, until finally, in mere decades 30 million people are dead. The New World depopulated, the Inadvertent Spanish Holocaust occurring 200 years earlier. And in Europe, as in our own world, the Vivaldis vanished, and forgotten, until Columbus arrives in 1491, to a renewed and resistant population of American Indians. Only this time, they do not succumb to disease. The Spaniards, the Portuguese, the English and French unable to gain a foothold in the New World. No Conquest. No colonies. Forced to trade on an equal basis, perhaps at a disadvantage, perhaps even enslaved, in their encounters with the American Indians, what a very interesting modern world that would be.But I ramble. Libertarians are just too easy to make fun of. Not unlike Vegans, or Hippies on Self-sustaining Communes, they are rather a hypocritical and pathetic bunch. I chalk it up mostly to their prefrontal lobes never quite adequately maturing, and so they are stuck in a perpetual adolescence of self-serving aggrandizement, an overindulgence in their own peculiar infantile version of their rights and entitlements, and a tendency towards chronic masturbation. Forget the paradox of the Zero Aggression Policy they espouse. They neither live up to it, nor can they identify the impossibility of the premise, nor the ludicrous consequences.But stay, we've enough critiques out there to savage the libertarian idiocy. Let us continue with the absurd notion of the United States of America existing under a version of the Articles of Confederation.James Madison, no slouch when it came to political philosophy, student of history, having examined the lives of as many republics as could come to his purview, recognized two facts. That a Republic faced two existential crises: 1) Being too small, and 2) being torn asunder by factions. His solution to both was the unpalatable but necessary solution of a strong central government. Like a political Copernicus, he recognized that the states, on their own, like the planets of the solar system, would fly off upon their own orbits without the strong central pull of a federal sun. And like a political Darwin, he recognized that the majority players within the fledging union would inevitably consume or overpower the minority members. And that, again, tyranny would not come from government, but whatever tyranny of the marjority controlled that government. Again, by creating a whale bigger than all the fishes, could the squabbling states be kept in line, swimming in an orderly school, rather than preying upon each other.But, in the Gallatin Divergence, this is not to be. Is it any great leap of insight, then, that a Union falling back upon the Articles of Confederation, would quickly be subject to the same chaos?But back to that Indian Confederacy... Oh, I know. They never stood a chance. Despite the genius of Little Turtle, despite the support of the British, they were overmatched. It would take a series of improbable events to save them. But, given an executed George Washington, are the events all that outrageous?Consider: in our timeline Little Turtle (Mich-i-kin-i-wa) had twice out fought and out thought superior forces - superior both in number and firepower. Given that \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne requires only one miscalculation, only one error in judgement, only one delay in supplies or similar logistical FUBAR, Little Turtle and the Brits sweep the field. And any subsequent dealings - given the blatant dishonesty and slimeball behavior of the Americans at the meeting for treaty at Sandusky - would have been met with no small amount of distrust on the part of the Indians.So, \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne, either diverted or defeated. The Battle of Fallen Timbers either not occurring or resulting in a third defeat of the Americans. Chaos of one sort or another within the fledgling North American Confederacy. Could a Michigan Confederacy have come into existence? A vast American Indian fist with an upthrust middle finger right in the heart of continental America? And why not? (As an American, I root for the underdog, so why not indeed?) With continued support of the British. With the weakened power and resolve of a now rudderless America. Once a strong union of tribes is established, they would be hard to remove, especially with the rise of Tecumseh. So, why not?And then what? If there is any region which might come close to continuing the traditional US expansion of our own timeline? Doubtful it is the Northeast. Despite the population boom in New  England, the stony soils are rapidly being eroded and depleted with the Medieval agricultural techniques being practiced. A population boom cannot be fueled without food, and the majority of immigrants into the Ohio territory came from New England. The Northeast, with renewed state squabbling, collapses economically. Pennsylvania is the great power in the region, although, without a federal government to promote interstate trade and exchange of science and technology, unlikely to help its neighbors. All states in the Northeast fall around the orbit of Pennsylvania, although a paltry and impoverished union compared to our own robust timeline. They fall further behind our own timelines advances with each passing decade. I would hazard that, in 1986, the North American Confederacy, attempting to live out the libertarian dream, bottled up in the Northeast surrounded by suspicious and inimical powers, might possibly be barely in the 1920s - in short, a puny, miserable, squalid country filled with a selfish, short-sighted people clinging to their guns and their religion.Again, is there a region which might come close to our own expansionist US? Look to the South. In the 1790s Virginia (including Kentucky) is the population heavyweight for the whole US coast. Undoubtedly, the southern states, geographically and culturally separate from the Northeast,  increasingly fed up with the tariffs, lawsuits, calls from the abolitionists and universal suffragists to end slavery and allow non-propertied commoners to vote and serve in office, would quickly become fed up and secede from the Confederacy, and probably sooner rather than later, perhaps as early as 1810-20s. Recognizing the folly of a weak union, they return to a federal system of government, but on that is oligarchical in nature. With chattel slavery, the plantation system, expansion into the rich plains and prairies of the West, usurpation of French and Spanish holdings, control of the Mississippi delta and basin, migration into the Midwest from the Northeast denied, the flood of pioneers would be diverted south. The Mexican territory of Texas is quickly flooded with pioneers both Yankee and Dixie. The influx of Yankee labor and middle class merchants into the southern plain states is welcomed by the Dixie aristocracy. The textile mills for cotton are built throughout the Gulf Coast, run by steam. Something of an industrial revolution occurs in the South, provided the factories are aristocracy owned. The idea of monarchy  (constitutional, of course) is entertained from time to time.Chattel slavery still exists in 1986. But now, formally institutionalized, more humane, more genteel, more just, with paternal traditions of welfare and social security in place for the lame, the halt, the faithful elderly servants. The South United States of America in 1986, may perhaps be only a few decades behind our timeline, perhaps in 1940s or 50s, although doubtful with any civilian or nuclear capabilities (and just as well).  A large contingent of Dixie is well established in California after the Gold Rush, and it is almost inevitable that the Southwest will eventually be purchased from an enervated and corrupted Mexican Empire.So there you have it. History is never what you think it will be. No doubt the course I laid out, so fully opposite the intent and desire of your standard libertarian, is , by virtue of being opposed to their favored fantasy, almost guaranteed to be what happens.Ha!"},

I then realized that the manager smelled like shit. He seemed to possess good hygiene habits, so something must have been wrong with his biochemistry.Why did I bring that up? I'm not really certain. It's similar to a very recent, rather strange occasion when I was sitting at my computer, reading news, and I became drowsy. For some reason, perhaps a garbled bit of instantiated prose resulting from my twilight brain state, something I read triggered a fugue of memories.  And not just any memories.You know how when you have a particularly vivid set of dreams and you wake up and think to yourself \"I really need to remember this as it is all just too bizarre not to be forgotten\"? And so you manage to hang on to the memories, replaying them to keep them fresh, but invariably they fade away.Well, this was as if those forgotten memories flooded back, from several months worth of dreams, but piecemeal, in no order, and all accompanied with a sense of urgency and importance. And more than just the memory, the intact experience, the sensory and somatic part as real as the usual weird hillbilly logic of incongruent visions and thoughts.

{"title": "Libertardian Nation", "date": "Wednesday, November 24, 2010", "text": "(From Urban Dictionary): Libertard (lib-er-tard): Mix of libertarian and retard. Used to denote a libertarian who is idealistic and has unrealistic expectations for a hypothetical libertarian society (see Libertopia).I've noted before that I'm a fan of counterfactual, or alternate, histories. I happened by accident to come across an alternate history world created by the author L. Neil Smith. It is a world which attempts to celebrate a libertarian utopia. An extremely valid and cogent historical question should be: Given that practically every form of government allowed by political theory has, at one time or another, been made manifest, why is it that no form of libertarian government has never materialized? Could it be that human nature disallows it, and that libertarians are either willfully ignorant or genuinely naive as to the realities of human greed and altruism? True, some have suggested eras and lands which might approximate Libertopia. Iceland during the Viking age, for example - provided you ignore slavery, clan and community social programs, the existence of communal resources (commons). Hmm. Not very libertopian at all, I'm afraid. A little too commie, in point of fact. All right then, how about 19th century America, after the Civil War and prior to the trustbusting and muckraking era of Teddy Roosevelt and the damned progressives? No regulation, free trade, open competition, (relatively) limited and small government. Things were pretty good, provided you were not black, or American Indian, or a in-general-non-white, or a woman, or part of the working class, or someone who needed medical attention. Okay, so maybe the latter part of 19th America was not so great after all.Well, then... oh, I know! America under the Articles of Confederation! Can't complain about that? Right? (Again, ignoring that you are not black, or Indian, or a woman, etc.). Well, that's what L. Neil Smith attempts to do, starting with a novel called \"The Probability Broach\". (I'll not savage the book here, there are any number of critics who have blasted it as wooden, stilted, filled with cartoon characters, and simply awful preachy dialogue).Smith creates a alternate universe libertopian paradise, which, in 1986, is called the North American Confederacy (the NAC).  Because for some reason a strong federal government discourages scientific advances, the NAC is far ahead of us in technology. They have colonies on the Moon, Mars and various asteroids. They can talk to chimps, apes, and dolphins. And everyone is extremely well-armed - including the chimps, apes, and dolphins, which, somehow, discourages major wars. Or something hand-wavy like that.And how did this come about, you may ask? Why, the Whiskey Rebellion!The what? Oh come ON, now! Recall your shoddy public grade school indoctrinations, comrades! The Whiskey Rebellion  was a tax protest that erupted in western Pennsylvania in the 1790s. Given the primitive transportation conditions of the time (no roads, no canals - no federal funds for same), farmers on the frontier could not get their corn to market without it spoiling. Their only alternative was to ferment, and then distill it into a less perishable form. The newly created federal government, in order to pay down the debt from the Revolutionary War and the disastrous policies of the incompetent competing state legislatures under the Articles of Confederation, created an excise tax on corn. The farmers argued they were exempt. Tax authorities disagreed. This resulted in a series of protests, violent encounters, and intimidation to discourage tax collectors which culminated in an armed uprising  in july 1794. The Washington administration collected an armed militia to counter the rebels, with Washington himself leading the army. However the protest collapsed before any hostilities.This is one turning point in history where Smith's libertopian world diverges. Albert Gallatin intercedes to the benefit of the rebels. This, through a series of improbabilities, leads to the overthrow and execution of George Washington (enemy of freedom), the abrogation of the United States Constitution, and a reestablishment of the government under a revised Articles of Confederation.And, then, of course, everyone lives happily ever after. Peace and prosperity, rational good behavior, efficient markets, and rapid scientific advances radiate outwards to bathe everyone in golden rainbow cheery brightness!I, uh, have a few problems with this. You see, for starters, you've got the Northwest Indian War going on. The Old Northwest? The Ohio Territory? This is a big problem. As part of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, the British Crown had ceded territory north of the Ohio river to the fledgling US of A. The Congress of Confederation (the real one), under the Northwest Ordinance Act of 1783, made formal claim over the region designated the Northwest Territory, inviting settlers to invade and hoping to generate much needed revenue through land grants. Responding to Indian raids in 1790, President Washington and Secretary of War Henry Knox, ordered a major offensive into Shawnee and Miami territory in Ohio and Indiana. After one disastrous US defeat after another, Washington in late 1793 finally ordered General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne to assemble a well-trained \"Legion of the United States\" to end the Indian problem once and for all. At the Battle of Fallen Timbers in August 1794, the Wabash Confederacy of the Indians was soundly defeated. The next year, with the Treaty of Greenville, Ohio and a slice of Indiana are given over to the US of A. It is the beginning of the end for the Indian nations.Ah, but note. In the alternate history, Washington is dead in August 1794. \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne, being supplied out of Pittsburgh, cannot possibly be uninformed as to the circumstances of the Whiskey Rebellion. There is little chance he would embark upon an expedition with conditions being what they are back in the colonies States. Then you've got Little Turtle, the amazing military tactician, and Tecumseh, the brilliant genius organizer and visionary, to deal with. By this point, both recognize the need to unite the tribes. Both recognize the juggernaut in the form of western settlers waiting to extinguish them. Both recognize a fight for survival. With the destruction of the infant federal government, they get some breathing room. And with the British forts still strung out on the Great Lakes, and the Brits more than willing, given a severely weakened federal government, to arm and supply the Indians (not to mention seed dissension among the states as to \"proper\" ownership), we are set up with the chance for a real power in the Midwest - an Indian Confederacy, armed, determined, and ready to thwart the advance of the white people. And, I suspect, they would have succeeded. Think. No strong federal government. No central bank. No federal funds for canals. No federal funds for roads. No federal funds for railroads. No Erie Canal. No federal militia. No standing armies. No navy. No Hamilton as Secretary of Treasury. Therefore, no national debt. With no debt, no inability to obtain international credit. With no credit, no Louisiana purchase. Do I really need to go on?The Empire of Democracy, stretching from sea to sea? The Dream Ends. Sorry, Smith. No continental United States. The Confederation reduced again to east of Appalachia, bottled up, states squabbling among themselves, walls of tariffs of goods and services built up between states, with a consequential stifling of specialization of production, with price increases. With no Navy, shipping costs skyrocket as merchants must see to their own security. With no standing Army, a constant call to arms from raids. Once you have a strong Indian Confederacy, with little resistance on the frontier, why wouldn't they want to rid the continent of White people. And what of Napoleon? With a weak US, he is more likely to cast an avaricious glance at the New World. And what happens when 1812 rolls around? What of the British?I suspect conditions would have become intolerable. Either the US is extinguished, or greatly diminished, and all thanks to limited government.Sorry, Smith, you are just so way, way off, you are not even wrong."},

During that time, I learned a number of semi-cynical lessons.1) Big Business makes money DESPITE itself. (See the Peter Principle).2) Once you get numbers above the tribe level (150-200 people) you enter bureaucracy territory. Your organization, despite growth, is now merely circling the drain.3) To err is human. To really screw things up requires a computer. To achieve world-class catastrophic fuck-ups of apocalyptic shit-storm proportions requires a bureaucracy.There are others, but you get the idea. It doesn't really matter if your organization is a private enterprise or a government. It doesn't matter whether you run it like a business or not. What matters is, once you pass the level of individual oversight, shenanigans sprout up, tips of icebergs appear, back room butt-fuckings and closet broomstick rapes commence.Oh sure, government has its fair share of fuckups. Katrina. Tuskegee syphillus experiments. Nuclear fallout. (But hey, what's a few irradiated Mormons between friends? It's not like they even pretend anymore that they owe allegiance to the US of A). For every one government fuck-up, you can name ten private enterprise fuck-ups, and those are the ten you know about.Given a choice between of having fraud, incompetence, malfeasance, horseplay in the halls and general dipshittery going on in either private enterprise and government, I prefer having government in charge mainly because we can usually catch the fuckers in the act.Take, for example, the latest bullshit with HR 3808 . The banksters had hoped that the cowards in Congress would grease the tracks for the continuing massive corporate fraud in the mortgage mess. Obama vetoed it, and fortunately, on its second go around, not enough representatives voted for it. (Please note: Democrats voted against it. Republicans voted, as usual, to fuck private citizens up the ass).So, in keeping with the title of this essay, I encourage and implore you to read Matt Taibbi's latest Rolling Stone piece on the mortgage mess. If, upon reading this, you are not livid with rage at the cocksucking banking motherfuckers, then consider this:A friend of mine in the mortgage industry informs me that this huge con-job is just the tip of the iceberg, and everyone was in on it. If the truth were known, the torches and pitchforks would come out, the mobs would march on Wall Street, and the guillotines would sing again."},

{"title": "End of the Blue Dog Tools", "date": "Thursday, November 11, 2010", "text": "A Difference of Opinion, Gerald Guthrie, 1996 Inkjet PrintThe physical layout at the studio where I work weekends is such that we have adopted a categorical system of tool usage by function. You will not find peg-boarded walls festooned with anal compulsive outlines of hammers and saws. You will find boxes of stuff, arranged as twistors, cutters, grabbers, bangers, snippers, etc. It looks sloppy, unkempt, disorganized, but it is an efficient way to work. Grab the needed tool out of the box or basket, throw it back in after you are done.Complain all you want to about party politics and partisanship, the fact of the matter is, it is here to stay.I've related how Martin van Buren used party politics to take the presidency. And that he was one of the worst leaders we've ever had. But that is the way it is. Much as I get angry over things like this (and I obviously do), over the lying, the cheating, the stealing, the Lowest Common Denominator corrupt, manipulative, venal, base, cynical behavior of politicians, this is the way things work. This is the nature of democracy. It is sausage making on an apocalyptic scale.It is the way things work for the same reason that any other suite of tools we use works, but in the social realm. It works. Grassroots movements may come and go, semi-anarchic egalitarian movements may rise and fall, but a hierarchical, closely linked, collective social network of like identities, common interests, and self-interested purposes consistently works in politics - regardless of the character of the system.Tools, I said? Yes, tools. Social tools. A suite of social tools. A cultural package. They've been around since at least the Neolithic. Ever since we started to collect in groups larger than clans and tribes, we've made use of this nebulous suite of virtual tools. Long before Twitter, long before Facebook, long before the recognition of these things in present form. Friendships, acquaintances, alliances, caucuses, a network of favors, debts, punishments, rewards, mutualisms, parasitisms, consortia, which together make up a group identity, a purposeful superorganism. That which we strangely insectoid-flavored socially mutated apes use to get things done. The Id of our Collective It. The creeky, vaporous mechanisms of our weird swarm behavior: our wisdom, and idiocy, and madness of crowds which is, well, us, governing.As someone who uses tools a lot, as someone who appreciates tools, I recognize that there is a holism to a suite of tools. In any craft task, you aren't just making use of one tool. They are bound, entangled, One Whole out of Many. The Greater Than the Parts. If I think about it too hard, when examining a beautiful piece of craftsmanship, or a really slick hack or fine job, I can almost get misty eyed about that suite of tools. I involuntarily invoke the Pathetic Fallacy, when I think of that faithful, brave, dependable, comforting, likable little satchel of tools. And when a job is botched, I can't really blame the tools, now can I? Can I blame all the conservative tools out there for the botched job of the last thirty years? Well, yes, and no. But if I am honest about it, I've got to blame the users rather than the tools.Of course, there is such a thing as redundant or worthless tools.Take, for example, Blue Dog Democrats. They are gone, not for any lack of functionality or missing social worth, but quite simply they are gone because they were redundant. Blue Dogs, mainly from the South, conservative Democrats, fiscally conservative (but that is rather a stupid designation, is anyone fiscally libertine?), occasionally socially conservative, were redundant. Useless. They were hammer-saws. Screwdriver-ratchets. Tweezer-files.People didn't need them, because there were other tools (pun intended) in the bag called Republicans that pretty much had the same function.Do I feel bad for the Blue Dogs? No. Why should I feel bad for a tool?"},

While I agree cast iron is extremely sexy,  I have a major hard-on for the look of titanium. It looks like steel but without the rust. Problem is, titanium is chemically highly reactive. In its molten state, it will eat through most refractory materials such as alumina, silica, or magnesia. As a result, a technique known as skull melting is used. This involves keeping a section of solid titanium metal interposed between the melt (done with an electric arc) and the crucible walls.Titanium melts at about 3000 degrees F. Because titanium is reactive with oxygen, a normal atmosphere cannot be used. Typically, the melt occurs in a neutral argon atmosphere or a vacuum.So, I wish to engage in vacuum induction skull melting, dude.Vacuum Induction Skull Melting of TitaniumAin't gonna happen.

Many have felt that - having gained an unassailable position of strength through the massive nuclear arms buildup, the development of Star Wars anti-satellite and missile shields, and the ascension of a new premier in the form of Gorbachev - Reagan could finally feel at ease at the bargaining table - much to the chagrin of the rabid war-wimp conservative hawks who now revere St. Ronnie's name.Well, Gorby was (is) an intelligent, reasonable, rational leader. He was someone you actually could negotiate with, rather than the calcified sclerotic necromorphs who occupied the Kremlin before him. Reagan, I suspect, was not entirely Alzheimered out yet. So, we got that going on.The arms buildup was formidable, but hardly credible. The Soviets, bless 'em, had managed to cancel all that advantage out by simply maintaining there existing rather formidable nuclear force.And Star Wars?... Well, Star Wars had always been, always will be, a fucking joke. Ask either side about that. Most of the generals are still alive. It mattered, despite Right Wing Lies to the contrary, not at all. Especially when the Soviets could have neutralized a fictional or working \"space shield\" with the addition of a few hundred dummy warheads. All I can think is, Edward Teller must have gotten Reagan to smoke some really good shit to buy into that fucking trillion dollar boondoggle.No, I figure Reagan was informed about the Dead Hand .What's that? Well, it was a doomsday machine built by the Soviets which went operational around January of 1985. It was designed to automatically launch a counterattack against the United States - just like in the movie Dr. Strangelove.You see, the Soviets, realizing that they could not compete militarily with the US, convinced that it was only a matter of time before those primitive paranoid batshit and bugfuck crazy Americans would launch a first strike, made sure that they built up an arsenal that would unleash so many horrors upon the world - nuclear, bacterial, viral, chemical, that not a single person, anywhere, under any shelter, would survive.\"Surely\" they thought, \"even the Americans will not want to destroy the world of humanity utterly\". (Because the dirty little secret is, despite shooting off every single warhead on Earth, civilization, despite the immense resulting shitstorms, would muddle its way through). So, this Doomsday strategy only works if people know about it. Which is, I suspect, why Reagan shat his Depends, on starting talking with Gorby. Yes, even Reagan could see where this is all going.Pity Rupert Murdoch does not see it the same way. He's made arrangements for his own Doomsday device to go off, should he kick the bucket. \"Arrangements have been made\", he says."},

The great physicist Richard Feynman once said \"The first principle is you must not fool yourself, and you are the easisest person to fool\". What he meant by that is \"Forget about what other people are lying to you about. Concentrate on what you are lying to yourself about\".Be careful with that. There are a lot of people out there who believe that they want what is best for the country, when, really, they want what's best for themselves. They just assume the rest of the country is just like them. Or at least as much of a chump as them. It isn't.I'd like to smarten up those types of chumps."},
{"title": "Griftopia", "date": "Saturday, October 30, 2010", "text": "==>The picture to the left is a politcal commentary on how JP Morgan bailed out the United States of America during the Panic of 1907.I would at some point like to get back to talking about America under the Articles of Confederation, and, for that matter, the fact that we lost most of what liberties we had gained from the Revolution during the tumultous period from say, 1787-1800, but I've no time. I would observe that the American revolution was completely unique in the history of the world because of geography. In no other country, in no other time, was it possible for things to turn out the way they did. And primarily because of the prospect of unlimited land. Property was rarely mentioned in revolutionary texts precisely because it was so taken for granted. Don't like where you are? Well, all the Injuns is pretty much killed off or helpless before us, move on! Grab some frontier property! It's free! Or might as well be.That wide open petri dish of a continent for our particular colony of bacteria allowed Americans to spread and breed at the absolute biological maximum, and boy did we ever! And this has never happened in recorded history. I suspect something like this hsn't happened since upper Paleolithic times, when hunter gatherers followed the herds into the New World.At any rate, I am reading excerpts of Matt Taibbi's upcoming book \"Griftopia\". (Some may know Taibbi as the man who branded Goldman Sachs the \"vampire squid sucking on the face of humanity\". With colored prose like that, how can it not be a good read?) It promises to be an interesting read, and there is an excerpt of the book at Rolling Stone magazine.I would mention that Indiana governor Mitch Daniels is being groomed as the sane Republican candidate for 2012. His (my) home state has been fortunate the past few years for not running a budget deficit, and Daniels is strutting around that. Of course, fortune is the appropriate word. And we will see how it goes if all those dumb Hoosiers vote in the proposition to cap property taxes, like California did years ago. It's not so much skill as luck, and, of course, pawning off state property, like the Indiana Toll Road, to foreign investors, so that he could plug budget holes. The Indiana Toll Road, over the span of  the hundred year lease, is expected to pull in 80 billion in net revenue. Mitch got a whopping 2 billion. Way to go, Mitch! If President, how much could he get for our national parks, I wonder? I think George Carlin once said \"Ever since the invention of priests and bankers, humanity has just been circling the drain\". Well, I think he is spot on about banks, I've always maintained that money, like air and water, is something we privatize and commodify at our own risk. I'm not quite a Marxist like the Founding Fathers were but I do think a very good case for nationalizing the creation of credit can be made.As recounted by the experience of Ben Franklin:\"When he arrived, he was surprised to find rampant unemployment and poverty among the British working classes… Franklin was then asked how the American colonies managed to collect enough money to support their poor houses. He reportedly replied: “We have no poor houses in the Colonies; and if we had some, there would be nobody to put in them, since there is, in the Colonies, not a single unemployed person, neither beggars nor tramps.”  In 1764, the Bank of England used its influence on Parliament to get a Currency Act passed that made it illegal for any of the colonies to print their own money. The colonists were forced to pay all future taxes to Britain in silver or gold. Anyone lacking in those precious metals had to borrow them at interest from the banks. Only a year later, Franklin said, the streets of the colonies were filled with unemployed beggars, just as they were in England. The money supply had suddenly been reduced by half, leaving insufficient funds to pay for the goods and services these workers could have provided. He maintained that it was \"the poverty caused by the bad influence of the English bankers on the Parliament which has caused in the colonies hatred of the English and . . . the Revolutionary War.\" This, he said, was the real reason for the Revolution: \"the colonies would gladly have borne the little tax on tea and other matters had it not been that England took away from the colonies their money, which created unemployment and dissatisfaction.\""},

Fermilab will continue its work to look for the Higgs particle, the particle which physicists theorize gives matter its mass.

Not much else to say, except, if true, serves you right you monkeyfucker.On the tech front, the Japanese have moved a step closer to their dream of not just fucking humanoid robots, but becoming humanoid robots. Further revisions to the Actroid-F model 7.

Biologists report dragonflies with wingspans of 300 feet. Plans are to contract out giant Japanese humanoid battle bots should the dragonflies threaten the warehouse district.That is All!The lesson of history is... no learns it.Here you've got tough times for the Baby Boomers. It was never supposed to be like this. The 21st century was supposed to be clear sailing right into the time of the Jetsons, living in sky apartments, and driving flying cars, and getting entitled government goodies that no one had to work for or be taxed upon.Instead, we got a depression, with savings and pensions wiped out,  a less than rosy future. And so these pampered, privileged, worst-day-better-than-the-best-3rd-worlder's-best-day, fat, soft, pink, slow, giantly-huge-buttocked lardasses go and fall on the floor, stamp their feet, hold their breath, turn blue, scream, and have a proper Tea party tantrum. Because We Ain't There Yet!And I'm picking on the Tea Party Republicans (yes, they are a Republican faction, make no mistake) again and again and again because, quite frankly, they are not helping the nation in any way whatsoever.They are, in fact, with each dumb decision, with each selfish piggy little grab at power, with each pouty whiny little obstruction, sending the United States of America daily closer to a fascist dictatorship....And...and...You know what? This isn't helping.Granted, I do think that the current batch of so-called \"libertarians\" and \"conservatives\", having drunk the Neoliberal Koolaid for the past 30 years, are seriously fucking up this country. And in a perfect world, in which a just and wise deity rules and metes out eternal punishment to his beloved creations, the koolaid would have made them all just... DROP DEAD in their tracks at the first sip. But this ain't a perfect world.The biggest problem is that we do have examples of what happens when government is indeed limited. And a real conservative, one who wishes to conserve the best traditions and institutions of this country, would choose to examine history warts and all. You know, examine our history rather than cherry-pick to justify his fucked up worldview. Honesty is the best policy, and all that.Kind of reminds me of my own lesson in honesty. I had a job interview once upon a time, where one of the questions I was asked was about a rather large gap in time on my resume.\"I notice you have nothing listed for the period from 1982-1984\" said the interviewer, \"What were you doing then?\"I could have bullshitted my way through that question, blaming the Reagan recession for lack of employment, or saying I was on sabbatical, or hiatus, but I told him the truth.\"I was an unemployed alcoholic at that time, living in the basement, sponging off my parents, and smoking a lot of dope\", I replied.\"Oh! Well, I can't fault you for your honesty!\" Got the job, too.Here's another. I had to attend a meeting with a boss who was just a complete sadistic asshole, if, and here's the qualifier, he found out you were bullshitting him or trying to foist off responsibility. I'd heard that regular attendees would often puke in the bathroom before the meeting. We had a problem closing out the business cycle due to a computer error. Once it was my turn on the griddle, and he asked me why we were not closing the books of the year.\"I fucked up\".\"Oh,\" he was completely disarmed. \"What are you doing to fix it?\"I told him what I was doing to fix it, and got out of the meeting unscathed.  So, honesty works more often than you would think.Okay, so honest appraisal of all data. Ever wondered why, we've never had a Libertarian Utopia? You know, a paradise of privatized social services and limited government? Anyone?Well, we did.We tried it. It didn't work. It was the United States under the Articles of Confederation.It was our missing piece of time that we are embarrassed to list on our resume. We ended up unemployed and  alcoholic, living in the basement.Look it up."},
{"title": "Kurman's Maxim", "date": "Thursday, October 28, 2010", "text": "In an essay entitled \"Theory and Practice of Time Travel\", the science fiction writer Larry Niven proposed a law which went:Niven's Law: \"If the universe of discourse permits the possibility of time travel, then no time machine will ever be invented in that universe\".This basically solved the time travel problem for Niven, because, let's face it, you've got a problem with global causality violation the minute you start mucking with time. Solution? Don't allow it. Stephen Hawking, The Pope of Science himself, has made similar noises. It's just not allowed.Hans Moravec suggested that, if time travel is possible, a way out of paradoxes would be the alteration of the act of travel itself. In other words, if a message is sent to the past, the very act of sending it causes the message to affect the sending of the message itself, in such a way that no paradox can occur. In different terms, let's say you have a pool table, and you hit a ball into a pocket that is a time machine which sends the ball back into the past, changing the shot you made and thus missing the ball. But according to Moravec, this will not happen. In a kind of Darwinian temporal dynamic, Reality will find the most fit solution to this causality violation to avoid a paradox. In the example, you would have actually missed the shot that sent the ball into the time travel pocket, but the ball appears from the future and knocks the ball into the time travel pocket. This is also known as the Novikov self-consistency principle.In other words, you can't change the past.In a previous essay on time travel, I came up with something similar. I knew I had called it \"Kurman's Law\", but I could not remember the exact wording.Google to the rescue.Kurman's Law: \"Any contingent change of history to alter the outcome of a turning point causes the turning point to cease to exist\".In other words, you, the time traveller, fervently wish that the South had won the Civil War. You go back and modify the conditions then extant so that the Confederacy can win the Civil War. And the South wins the Civil War. Huzzah!But, traveling back to your own time, you find out that the Civil War never happened in the first place. In order for them to win, you have changed conditions so much that the conflict never occurs in the first place.Paradox avoided. But, you saw them win. Yeah, well, tough shit.Well, actually, there's another, better, Kurman's Law, which I found while googling. And it goes like this.Kurman's Law: \"No man is completely worthless. He can always be used as a bad example\".Dude, whoever you are, Kudos and Godspeed. Wish I'd thought of it. (Actually it sounds like something my older brother would write, but... nah).Therefore, my law will no longer be a law. It will henceforth be Kurman's Maxim. Please make a note of it."},
{"title": "Monkeys on Treadmills - or - More Weird Japanese Shit", "date": "Wednesday, October 27, 2010", "text": "Okay, here we go! I'm going to try an embeddence. A few words first. I recently tried to find a video of a monkey riding a treadmill. To my thorough disgust, there are none to be found on the internet.\"Why?\" you ask, \"do you wish to find a video of a monkey riding a treadmill?\"Well, I read an article on neural rehabilitation, in which they severed the spinal cords of monkeys, wired up the nerve endings, and then set them to walking on treadmills, while the signals to the nerve endings were transmitted via the wires to robots. So, spinal-cord injury monkeys are radio controlling robots. And I wanted to see a video of it, if it existed.No, I'm not shitting you. I wish I could find the article. In fact, it now makes me wonder about all those kids playing first person shooter and MMPORG video games. They could be the monkeys on treadmills, remotely operating robots, in, say, China, assembling cell phones or something...Anyway, it really doesn't have to do with the Japanese robot video I am about to embed. Well, only partly.We've all known for a long time now that the Japanese have rather strange sexual proclivities. They like bondage, and school girls. And pixellating private parts. And virtual girlfriends. And Real Dolls. And the end result of all this, their Final Solution so it would seem is that they want to fuck robots.Actually, I think it's quite more than that. They not only want to fuck robots, they want to be robots. Look at their anime, their cartoons, their fascination with giant humanoid fighting robots. The fact that they've been in a national depression for nigh on twenty years. Of course they want to be robots. No more aging. No more sad emotions. Just pure utter power. And fucking. With metallic parts. Gotta be it.Here we go:Did that work?  It did! Yay!So, the Japanese are just starting to emerge from the Uncanny Valley . This is only borderline creepy.I've mentioned before the four levels of stupidity. Let's recap.Level 1 Stupid: Process stupid. The wiring ain't right. Something definitely wrong with the brain, can't process things right. Automatically absolved of behaviors. Remediation: Supervision. Restraints, if necessary.Level 2 Stupid: Ignorant stupid. Can process information, just doesn't have enough information. Has either been deprived of facts, or unaware of them. Remediation: Inform and educate.Level 3 Stupid: Unreasoning stupid. Can process information, has the facts available, can't analyze, associate, and synthesize to reach a conclusion. Usually under the age of 25. Remediation: Again, inform and educate.Level 4 Stupid: Dangerously stupid. Can process information, has the facts, can analyze, asociate, and synthesize, can reach conclusion. However, if conclusion violates chosen worldview, chooses not to. Remediation: Supervision. Restraints, if necessary. Repeat offenses endangering others: Banishment to the Island of Broken Toys.Well, apparently there is now a fifth level of stupid: Kentucky Stupid. This involves a guy named Profitt ignoring a huge fucking suite of behaviors that can be used in a confrontational situation, and just going right for the violent reaction. And then providing weasel arguments about how (despite supposedly espousing a conservative policy of personal responsibility), \"it warn't actually mah fawlt kausin' the po-lice shood stapped in and kep me frum doin thet\". Is it fair to call it Kentucky Stupid? Actually, I'm quite fond of Kentucky and its inhabitants. Some of the hottest babes I've ever seen were down there. And when I was in college at IU, I subscribed to the Louisville Courier-Journal , and found the paper to be consistently well-written, the articles cogent, the coverage dang near interstellar in its scope.So, no, it's not fair to call this behavior Kentucky stupid. However, I do recall a time when a woman from Kentucky confronting a particularly stupid individual, poking her finger into his chest and telling him, in that particular dialect that holds more dipthongs per syllable than most:\"You're stupid\".Beleive me, when you are called stupid by someone with that accent, you are really fucking stupid."},

I have to assume it means someone was getting paternalistic and patronizing with me. And seeing as I am fundamentally recalcitrant, I didn't cotton well to this.Speaking of which, I've noted a lot of election event editorials about how \"The Left Doesn't 'Get' The Tea Party\". About how the Left is alarmed and fearful of a party that, message parsed down, no honest, Means Well.Hey, Don't Get All Papa Smurf On Me.You lookin' out for yourself, teabaggers. Not me. Not the nation. Your own interests. How do I know? Because you say you are the inheritors of the mantle of the founding fathers. Because you call yourself patriots. Because you call yourself a party.Oh, you who never learn history.Let me tell you what the founding fathers they would think of the Tea Party Patriot movement. They would be gravely disappointed. The founding fathers would look at these soft, fat, pampered pink apes and shake their heads in disgust.How do I know this? Because that's they thought about post-revolutionary America. They were gravely disappointed in it. How do I know this? They wrote about it. To one degree or another, they were ashamed and dismayed by what America had become. The revolutionaries, from James Warren and Samuel Adams to David Ramsay, Light-Horse Harry Lee, Christopher Gadsden, Thomas Jefferson had all lost faith in the revolution.Benjamin Rush: \"We are indeed a bebanked, bewhiskied, and bedollared nation\". Democracy in America \"will certainly fail\".John Adams, bewailing the results of the revolution, including the commodification of democracy, the religious revivals and Bible societies of \"the bigoted and superstitious\", wrote \"Where is now, the progress of the human mind? When? Where ? and How? is the present Chaos to be arranged in Order?\" The founding fathers found it difficult to accept that their fate now rested in \"the opinions and votes of a small-souled and largely unreflective ordinary people\".George Washington  himself, at the end of his life, had lost all hope for democracy in America. Party spirit, he said in 1799, had destroyed the influence of good character in politics. One could as well \"set up a broomstick as candidate\", \"call it a true Son of Liberty\", and it would \"command their votes in toto\".Ouch! What would they think of us tiny-brained moderns? Especially those who, living in comparative paradise, complain so frequently and readily. And who is to blame? Well, one significant part would  be the formation of political parties. The modern political party, a permanent institution to which loyalty to becomes the sole criterion of political worth, goes back to Martin van Buren - the first modern professional politician. Van Buren had no fame, no fortune, no military record, no reputation of achievement, no charisma. He was barely known throughout the United States. What he did do was build the best and most organized political party the nation had ever seen. van Buren's Democratic-Republican party, soon to be shortened to the Republican party*, won him the election.I deem it no small coincidence that Martian van Buren is classified by historians as the worst president ever. No small accomplishment that. It seems the designation stems from the fact that, during the Panic of 1837, van Buren refused to regulate the banks that defrauded the American people. What else? How about the Trail of Tears?Partisan politics. The flesh eating bacteria of the American dream.*(Update 10/28/10) this should read the Democratic Party rather than Republican. I admit my error rather than engage in weasel revisionist editting."},

I'd really like for you to be up in Heaven with me when you die\".Yeah, he's a childlike idiot. For one, I've told him numerous times I am not an atheist. Being an atheist requires faith. And two, he assumes that some part or all of our personality persists after death. And three, that some region of space and time exists somehow somewhere eternally which would correspond to an earthly idyll. And four, a really big stretch, is that, because he believes in Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior, all of the awful sins of omission and commission he has performed throughout his long and tawdry life will be forgiven.Another time, after a very strange and ultimately annoying proselytizer informed me that I was going to hell. Or rather, in her mind, Going to Hell.I replied, \"Honey, I've had job offers\".Again, she assumed that for one the personality, in part or in whole, persists after death. For two, that there exists some type of cosmic justice which closely corresponds with our monkey ethics and morals. And for three that some place exists eternally, in which those not quite up to snuff according to these cosmically ordained monkey ethics and morals, enjoy eternal suffering and degradation.There's actually more than just these assumptions as to where you can go. The first assumption is the big one, that you persist. What happens after that gets shadier and vaguer, and all pretty much colored and limited by human imagination. But I figure (accepting the first assumption as true) it probably is roughly divided into benign, neutral, and malignant consequences. Perhaps not. If, for example, you are just let lose into the larger universe, without any possible way of interacting with matter, like a ghost or something, where is the fun in that? Or purpose? Or even worse, what if you can't interact with anything? Including other spirits. Not much fun at all.Oh, it could be fun. Who knows? As is the case for or against God, if you posit an infinite universe, or an infinitude of universes, pretty much anything is possible. Heavens, Hells, Purgatories, Valhallas, Ginungagaps, boring Limbos, and who knows what else?Because we are constrained by our monkey minds within our monkey bodies to only a small set of what can be.

Survivalists assume that, should the shit ever hit the fan, somehow, life will still be pretty much the same. You know, the soil will still be fertile. The air and water won't be poisoned. There will be plenty of game to hunt. It will simply be a matter of stocking up on ammo, and things will work out.All pretty dangerous assumptions, I'd say.   If the shit really hits the fan, it could be any number of bad things, none of which preclude being able to live off the land. Space suits, for example, may be required to go outside. Country boys, it may turn out, may have to rummage through the trash and look for uncontaminated canned goods and bottled water just like the rest of us woefully unprepared city folk, which is pretty much everybody in the developed world nowadays.Perhaps Hank should update the song to \"the poverty stricken third worlders who already live in abject squalor and are used to it will survive!\" But that makes for a much more awkward chorus. Probably.Where is this all going? Well, I had a conversation with someone who in turn had a conversation with someone, a particularly well off someone, who mentioned on the QT that a group of millionaires have purchased land up on the UP of Michigan and set themselves up in an enclave.

{"title": "Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Rocketpunk,...", "date": "Thursday, October 14, 2010", "text": "A common complaint since the advent of mass production is the loss of the artisanal touch on products. That is, the feeling that personal flourishes and attractive additional details, a personal touch, is now lacking  in our manufactured items. Of course, this is not necessarily so. Design plays a huge role in manufacturing. Industrial design, as a formal pursuit, is actually quite recent. It may seem, in today's rather featureless designs, that the human touch has disappeared, but it hasn't. It's just the Bauhaus influence. Form follows function, and all that.The fact is, we've always made our objects special. Take, for example the very first cast iron bridge ever built, called, not surprisingly, the Iron Bridge. Built upon the river Severn in Jolly Olde, near Shropshire. It contains no welds, no rivets. All the parts are fastened together with blind dovetail or mortice and tenon joints, as if it were a piece of furniture. And a fine piece of iron cabinet making it is. You can see that there is an artistic quality in the bridge that was wholly unnecessary. There are design movements, primarily coming from the scifi geek side of the realm, that strive to incorporate artisanal elements into product, and do so by drawing from tradition. One such movement, called Steampunk, has received attention from even the general public. Steampunk draws inspiration from the Victorian period of industrialization, say, from 1860-1900 or thereabouts.  To treble up on the geek factor, here is a steampunk rendition of Star Wars figurines:Steampunk, obviously, envisions objects and people as if today's (or the future's) current technologies existed back in the day of Jules Verne. Polished brass, well-oiled leathers, finely finished rare and tropical woods, matte grey surfaces of wrought or cast iron would dominate the look of things.Here's a steampunk lap top:Another movement is called Dieselpunk, and harkens back to the era of perhaps 1920-1945. If Steampunk is retro futuristic, then Dieselpunk has been called futuristic retro. The idea being that things in the future, utilizing a early mid 20th century aesthetic, would look like this. Of course, that's wrong. Dieselpunk is Steampunk, just evoking a different desing era. I've really found no good dieselpunk images that are as charming as stemapunk, but think Terry Gilliam. I would say Terry's Brazil has not only got dieselpunk down pat, he invented it.The world is one of a combination of both exposed and hidden infrastructure, depending upon whether the inner workings are considered \"elegant' ro not. Throw in a judicious use of Orwellian packaging, and you are on your way. In fact, the 1920s and onward was the start of the era when packaging was more important than the actual product. Add in one further introduction to desing, known as the \"kludge\" which is a modification used to fix and obvious problem, which in turn becomes a feature. In other words, a bandaid is foisted off as a attractive enhancement.Or 12 Monkeys. You get the idea:Well, might as well keep going forward. The next stage doesn't have a name as far as I know, so I'll give it one. Rocketpunk. Design from 1945-1970 or so.I chose the end point of 1970, because after that you start to see touch sensitive buttons and LED indicators. Analog clock dials and chunky pushbuttons start to disappear. If you grew up with me, a boomer baby, through the late 50s and the decade of the 60s, you know exactly what I mean. Any scifi movie or TV show, and spy film is Rocketpunk. Computers with lots of flashing lights and tape reels on them. Star Trek. Lost In Space. That's all rocketpunk.What's next? Electropunk from, say, 1970-1985 or 90? Well, that's a music genre. I don't know."},
{"title": "More Stupid Ideas", "date": "Wednesday, October 13, 2010", "text": "A friend of mine told me that over in Jolly Olde England, there are surveillance cameras everywhere now. And that, a friend of his sits around in his apartment watching feed from cameras that are in a department store. If he happens to catch a shoplifter on the telly, he phones it in for security at the store to nab the malefactor. If the shoplifter is caught, the watcher receives a reward, which is a percentage of the stolen item.So, all I have to do is find out who is watching what, have an accomplice, who stops by the watcher's apartment and distracts him by, oh, I don't know, pretending to be a Jehovah's Witness or something.Meanwhile I, trench-coated and wearing a fake beard and a pony tail wig, grab everything that isn't nailed down in the place.No? Well, actually this rather peculiar occupation, security watcher, or what would you call it, gave me another stupid idea. Robots and computers are very good at performing tasks for which a specific and detailed rule set can be laid out - playing chess (Big Blue), welding and cutting metal (CNC lathes and factory robots). What they are terrible at are tasks that have ambiguous or nebulous skill sets, generalized things that require adaptive thinking, or a sense of nuance or intuition, or are dependent upon context. Tasks like translating languages, or rearranging a living room, or mixing a drink to taste, or exploring. There are lots of things like this that human beings are supremely good at, and probably will be for a long time to come.So, for example, a gentleman's gentleman sounds like a good job for a robot, but robots would be absolutely terrible at it. Ah, but a remotely piloted robot, one that is operated by a person, would actually be a pretty good butler.\"Well, that's just fucking stupid, John\" you say, \"Why not just hire a real butler?\"Well, yeah, but butlers aren't used all the time are they? And some guy sitting on an oversized couch in his soiled undies in an apartment, wearing video game gear and multitasking perhaps four or five butlers might be cheaper. Don't you think? Even make it a game that you get paid for. The perfect skill set for today's slackers.Serisously though, I think you will see a lot more of these remotely piloted devices, and not just for the boneheaded purpose of bombing people using unmanned drones. The deep sea remotely piloted submersibles used in the BP fiaso is a good example. Allowing people to perform dangerous tasks without risk, and giving robots an intelligence and mental flexibility they will never possess, seems like a win/win to me. Think of the Chilean miners they are rescuing. What if they had been piloting mining robots? Why not?*FYI: The picture is a portrayal of a famous automaton called The Mechanical Turk. This was a chess-playing robot of the 19th century which actually had a human operator hidden within it."},

Just as I found the place, one of their members was being booted out. Don't know why, and don't actually care.What I do care about is she is here on blogger now and I encourage anyone who reads this to check her out.She also as a website.I remember a friend of mine talking about a sidewalk artist he found in Vegas who could whip up your portrait in less than a minute. He eventually had his portrait done and proudly brought it home to show friends and family.It was fucking awful.And I should know, because as a fairly unsuccessful artist I have done some fucking awful things and know what it takes to do that. And this portrait was just fucking awful. My friend had somehow sprouted a Richard Simmons hairdo, and developed a gap in his front teeth that David Letterman would have been proud of. And his body was wearing his head. (Like the one time I drew a guy whose hat was wearing him). Now, this guy has a pretty fat face, but this was, like, genetic anomaly. Even if the intent were caricature, it would still be fucking awful, because it did not even look like him. It belonged in the Museum of Bad Art. I just wish I had a picture of the guy with his portrait. That would have saved a whole paragraph.At any rate, that's not what Zina does. She does good art. Which is good, because otherwise we'd have to roll up a newspaper and hit her saying \"Bad artist! Bad!\"Please have a look. I'm sure you will enjoy her stuff."},
{"title": "So, here's the deal...", "date": "Sunday, October 10, 2010", "text": "It's getting to the point where I can't remember if I've written about something or not. I think maybe I should start going through all of my essays and label them so that I can remember what I did and did not say while there is still a manageable number of them. Yeah. Right.I suppose it's now only a matter of time before I go all Uncle Ed on you guys. My Uncle Ed used to tell about the same dozen stupid ass stories. And when we reminded him that we'd heard it, h'ed say \"Ah, but I haven't told you the details!\" And then we'd all roll our eyes at each other and pantomime firing revolvers into temples.It also occurs to me that, for a online journal called Random Walks, I pretty much stick to one subject within the confines of an essay. I mean, it seems right about now I should go all wild ass stream of consciousness and talk about braided streams, or the color magenta, or rare earth elements or some kind of shit.But I don't do that.And starting now would seem so contrived and artificial.Hey! Speaking of  contrived and artificial, I completed two wax figures and am not at all happy with them. For a time I was going to cast them in bronze, but now... I don't think so. I guess my problem with them, well, actually I have a lot of problems with them. They are too stiff and lifeless for one. And they are not particularly interesting, in either the depiction or pose. And the proportions are off and they are not particularly well rendered. The hands and feet are too small, and add to the doll-like look. This I can fix, but... I've run out of energy for them. And the scale is wrong. They are about 17\" high. The scale is such that they look even more doll-like, and they look doll-like enough. I honestly don't know what to do with them. The woman is awkward, but the guy, the guy is just a dork.Wax is hard for me to photograph so the photos themselves also suck but here you go.The couple together:Another view:The woman's backside:I have a feeling I will just make molds of them and then move on. Maybe something will suggest itself later.I will use the man for a rigging demo in my bronze casting class where I show the students how to put the cup, sprues, runners, and vents on their wax pieces."},
{"title": "\"Let All The Poisons Hatch Out\"", "date": "Friday, October 8, 2010", "text": "\"Let all the poisons that lurk in the mud hatch out\"  Romans 1:18-25I've decided that the best thing to happen to this country is for all of those bat-shit crazy Teabagger and rabid social conservative Republican candidates to get elected and sent to Congress.This will serve two purposes:1) To show the American public the difference between governing by principle, and governing by pragmatism. In other words the letter and the spirit of the law. Granted, a lot of these candidates (Rand Paul, Christine O'Donnell) have toned down their bat-shit craziness to get support from the GOP, but others (Sharron Angle, bless her) have gotten even nuttier, if that's possible. We've already got the likes of Jim Demint, Michelle Malkin, Newt, oh wait, forget that dipshit has-been, others in Congress to show us all how its done, just how fucked up government can get under them. We need a lot more of this. As P.J. O'Rourke said \"Republicans believe government doesn't work. Then they get elected and prove it\". This is not to say the Democrats can do better, but at least they try to govern, even if they fuck it up most of the time. But Republicans? What did they have, a decade in power? And did a single agency, department, bureau or division disappear? Not one! Lazy, incompetent, stupid-ass motherfuckers! Bring 'em back! Finish the fuck-up already! Take us back to the year 2! Assholes!2) We, the American public, will finally find out just how many of us are ape-shit insane, how many terminally fucked-in-the-head dipshits actually populate our land. And, if I had my way, deportation proceedings will start immediately depending upon their vote. And then we will proceed to bring in smart, savvy, industrious, clever, brilliant worthy Americans from China, India, Africa, Latin America, Mexico, and the rest of the developing world to take their place.Why, the collective IQ of the US of A should immediately jump 50 points. And all those useless whiners that do nothing for this country will be sent back to whatever shit-hole in Europe they got kicked out of in the first place. You want to see a true meritocracy? Send 'em back! Those fat, slovenly, pampered, privileged, butter-bunned lard-heads will get the crap kicked out of them!And so, I actually am looking forward to November, and the government shut-down in 2011. \"Vote the Dipshits In!\" is my bumper sticker of the moment.And then... and then... well, I'll worry about that later!"},
{"title": "Horror Stories", "date": "Wednesday, October 6, 2010", "text": "In literature, in fiction, the formula is a) Build up a reader's familiarity with the scene, set, setting and character of the protagonists and then b) something bad happens.That's basically it. The consequences of something bad happening determine whether the story becomes comedy or drama, but the something bad is usually bad even when it is good. And the something bad happening is, just like in real life, usually unexpected. Even if the something bad is a planned action, the consequence is unexpected. If it wasn't, there wouldn't be much of a plot. So, the unexpected happening kind of suggests that the most general category of fiction is the horror genre.Horror because events are unexpected, and our little brains just naturally produce fear as their first reaction. It's just the way things are. You've got the primary conduit of sensory data pointed right at the amygdala, the seat of fear, and then a secondary, slower conduit to the forebrain, to the part that impedes our actions. Which, really, is what free will is all about. Not about the power to do things, but the power to restrain yourself from doing things.From an evolutionary standpoint, from a fitness standpoint, this makes sense. Don't take chances. See a stick on the ground, the core brain says \"Snake!\" and you instinctively jump back. Then the forebrain evaluates things, figures out it is a stick, gets all embarrassed, and sends signals to the rest of the brain to calm down.The horror element is merely dependent upon how much information you get, and how much is left to the imagination. No information at all, and you are unaware of the danger. Doesn't matter if there is a scaly giant lizard in the basement if you have no knowledge of it. Similarly, too much information and you know about it, you understand it, you might even empathize with it, and so you are not scared of it. Ah, but just the right amount of information, just enough so you know enough to be afraid, that is, like so many things, an delicate spell.I think perhaps this is why psychological horror works best of all. No need for shocking visual images, no need for blood and gore. The suggestion of these things is more than enough. Radio horror stories are perhaps even scarier than TV or movies, because they take place within the theater of the mind.As a kid, one of the movies that nearly made me shit my pants was a movie called \"The Haunting\" . Directed by Robert Wise, a masterful manipulator  of dramatic action, it contains perhaps only two or three scenes of visual special effects. All the rest is atmosphere, music, sound effects, and, oh ,what do you know, acting.  Robert Wise wisely lets us scare ourselves into a panic.Kind of like the political climate. Visions of the future. Either dystopian or utopian. I submit that the utopian version is scarier.There are three likely paths humanity can take. The first path, the one everyone needlessly worries about, is collapse.  Scarcity, peak oil, the end of civilization, anarchy, war, pestilence, famine, plague, all that good stuff. That's dystopia, a dystopian future. We are intimately familiar with this. This is all known to us. There is nothing to fear here.The next two paths are utopian. The post-scarcity future. This is a future partially known to us.Certain people have lived in such an anomalous time, when they lacked for nothing. Well, not entirely. Some labor still had to be performed. Some things earned. But few are aware of such a state of affairs. Generally, the few examples of this have suggested that people are still dissatisfied, are prone to delinquency and hooliganism. It may be, in a future of no lack of need, a future of no toil, that people will not know what to do with themselves. it may resemble the movie \"Clockwork Orange\" . The State, in finding a way to keep them docile, may resort to creative destruction. A channeling of these natural anarchic destructive forces into a sanctioned and planned vandalism. Again, this is somewhat familiar. Nothing really unknown here, and therefore nothing to fear.Which leaves the last utopian path. This is a path totally unknown to us. A future where, again, all lack for nothing, but then all desire nothing. All needs are fulfilled. How frustration of desires is eliminated is unknown. Perhaps we are cybernetically or genetically or surgically altered so that the desire itself is suppressed. Perhaps the desire is channeled into harmless activities, virtual reality perhaps. Perhaps the darkest desires of murder, rape, torture are fulfilled in a cybernetic game zone, and we all become torpid creatures living out fantasies. Or perhaps technology advances to the point that there is no death, or at least no permanent death, and we are allowed to actively pursue our most base fantasies upon each other. It could be that we become completely safe from harm, completely immoral, completely sadistic, vile, loathsome immortal creatures. Demons in Paradise.That would be the scariest thing of all."},
{"title": "Belief: Part 1 of 2", "date": "Tuesday, October 5, 2010", "text": "belief: 1. The mental act, condition, or habit of placing trust or confidence in another 2. Mental acceptance of and conviction in the truth, actuality, or validity of something 3. Something believed or accepted as true, especially a particular tenet or a body of tenets accepted by a group of persons. (From Middle English bileve, bileven, to believe; of Old English gel-aefa; see leubh- in Indo-European roots.) (leubh- Indo-European root: loving, desiring, caring. Related words, love, beloved, libido. So, obviously, beliefs are something cherished, something to wrap your arms around and snuggle, something to get you all mushy and sentimental. That's a strange way to feel about something as nebulous, unresponsive, unrequited, and intractable as an idea, or a set of ideas. It's like having feelings for a stuffed animal. Let me get back to you on that. When I started, I was raised as a Lutheran, which isn't that far from being a Catholic. So, the usual right? Tri-partite Godhead, Father Son, Holy Ghost. Loving personal God, omniscient, omnipotent, all that stuff. Then, of course, curious young lad notices logical inconsistencies and paradoxes. These in turn evaluated, discussed, and any questioning summarily dismissed by religious authorities both local and distant. With the observation of the imperfect state of the world combined with the obvious ignorance and hypocrisy of said authorities resulting in the inevitable cynical conclusion that There Is No God and all by about the age of fourteen years old.Of course, it turns out that the atheist's position is just as philosophically and empirically untenable and unprovable as the theist's. The statement \"There is no God\" is a positive assertion, a statement of fact as subject to the burden of proof as the statement \"There is no more toilet paper in the bathroom\". Anyone who tells you different (especially atheists) are either intellectually dishonest or just yanking their own pud in public.So, in response, I've modified my position to that of agnostic. It's not the weak weenie-boy \"I Don't Know\" type of agnosticism. It's more the \"I honestly don't know, and I doubt that you know either. So if you are going to get all rabidly serious about it, best to keep it to yourself unless you want your primitive superstitions and monkey gods to be made fun of\" type of agnosticism.On the one hand, it's a big universe out there. Look at the picture. That's billions of light years, billions of galaxies in that picture. That's a huge amount of space and time, a truly scary yawning vast abyss of who-the-fuck-knows-what out there. It could even be infinite. In which case, seems like there is plenty of room for doubt against the Case Against God. On the other hand, there is no reason to assume there is a monkey shaped god giving us the gunfinger, the wink and the nod.Just for the heck of it, I once entertained the notion that there really was a loving personal god out there, looking after me, keeping an eye out, in my corner. The flood of warm relief that passed through me was pretty remarkable. But then, I went back to my normal way of thinking, and that wonderful warm feeling passed away soon enough. And there I was back to living in uncertainty. Back to, you know, the normal state of human affairs, which is generally one small emergency away from a full-blown panic attack.So, what's a person to do in this situation? I don't know. I guess I choose to live life as it comes. I choose to love life as it comes. For good or ill. That's my belief. My beloved."},
{"title": "Beyond Iron Man", "date": "Sunday, October 3, 2010", "text": "So, Raytheon is working on version 2 of their exoskeleton suit. This is a hydraulic powered metallic frame that a soldier can wear like a suit, and perform superhuman feats of strength. The buzz from the technogeeks is, \"Geewhiz! Just like Iron Man!\" The plan is that the military will have these suits to use in the field in three to five years, with a autonomous suit in five to ten years. (Since the suit is powered by hydraulics, pipes must be run to a large generator/compressor). Now, the stupid bonehead intention is that these be used for lifting/loading stuff and/or war fighting capabilities.Of course, I'm betting  the marketing boys at Raytheon realize that the real market for these suits (a non-military version) is for the handicapped/infirm/obese/elderly crowd. I mean, you can probably produce 2-3 million for the armed forces, but 200-300 million for the world's mobility challenged.Think of those hover chair commericals where they say you can go to see the Statue of Liberty or the Grand Canyon, now perhaps update it with a Glenn Beckian \"Clydie Clyde\" hateful morning zoo voice taunting grandma that \"Yeah, but you can't climb the steps in your hoverchair!\".Although, I'm sure they will present it in a more friendly version.And speaking of which (the taunt), who is the woman who does the poisonous green gossipy bitch voice in all those negative political ads? It's the same woman's voice, all the time, I swear. \"What do you for a living my dear?\"\"I'm the venomous cunt voiceover in paid political advertisements\".\"Well, I hope it pays well!\"Oh, it does, it does.What? Happy Harvest? What is this crap?I've noticed, on my runs through the neighborhoods around me, that the Halloween decorations are going up. The inflatable displays are starting to get quite sophisticated - moving beyond the ghosts and pumpkins. They are quite fun. But I've also noticed that \"Happy Harvest\" signs are starting to sprout up.I haven't really been paying attention, so I went to That Which Will Soon Know All (the unborn little 'g' god known as google) to find out what's up. Ah, I see. It is a Christian alternative to Halloween. As one website put it \"many Christians have voiced their concerns that Halloween does not bring glory to Jesus Christ, and have chosen to celebrate the season with different kinds of festivities\". Okay. Fine. As a \"heathen\", I've got no problem with any kind of silly religious claptrap so long as it is not in my face. Whether its weeklong orgies at the Eleusinian Mysteries, or filling the air with incense during Vasant Panchami, I don't care. Although I think I draw the line at human and animal sacrifice. All of that silliness is fine with me, who has no religious sentiments whatsoever (and as a presentiment, I suspect I'll soon write something about my beliefs).It's not surprising, given that the more rabid zealots here in the US are trying vigorously to turn us into a Christian nation, and from there into a Pat Boone approved Holy Dictatorship. (Which I am not in the least worried about, as Americans, being the primitve and parnoid lot that we, are sniff tyranny on the most distant breezes, and won't allow anyone that type of control).So, Happy Harvest. That's fine. Want to set up a harvest display on the lawn, go for it. Just don't get in your neighbor's face if they want to practice the black arts, or honor the world of  the dead, or engage in a pagan ritual as part of their revelry. Okay? Seriously, dont' be pulling that shit. And remember that freedom of religion does mean freedom from religion as well, despite what the creepy authoritarian Republicans say.I think what I am more worried about is fireworks. Have you noticed that fireworks are starting to crop up for practically every holiday? I'm not sure, but again, given how primitive we Americans are, with our love of blowing shit up and making pretty explosions, you'd think we'd have fireworks every night. But I am concerned about this. If we are going to have fireworks for every holiday, can we at least make them holiday themed fireworks? You know, green and orange fireworks, pumpkins, witches on brooms and shit for Halloween. Candy canes, Santa and his sleigh, red, green and white fireworks for Christmas. That kind of stuff?

{"title": "Suspension of Disbelief", "date": "Friday, October 1, 2010", "text": "I'm sorry readers, but I have to geek out on you. This is a geek moment I am not proud of. This essay is essentially going to be the public washing of my metaphorical Speedo undies with skidmarks in them. I'm afraid it will end up being an imaginary discussion, but so be it.On another comment forum of a neighboring electronic journal, a participant asked for suggestions about a science fiction story he was going to write which took place in the year 2030. He provided a synopsis of the setup, starting off with the fact that the US suffered a bioterror attack in the year 1996-\"Whoa, wait! A bioterror attack on the US in the year 1996?\"\"Yes. It is a water-borne attach that wipes out 25% of the US population, and whites are suddenly a minority\".\"So it's an alternate future history?\"\"Well, wait, some of the survivors of the Christmas Plague, as I call it, become psychic\".\"Okay, so it is an alternate future history fantasy\".\"Um, yes, and President Gore attacks Iraq in retaliation\".\"Ah, so Clinton dies in the attack\".\"Obviously\".\"Just wanted to make sure. Can you kill off Newt Gingrich while you're at it?\"\"...OK\".\"Well, here's the problem. Aside from the fact that, if this was science fiction, it should have been written prior to 1996, it doesn't really seem that original of a scenario, don't you think? Terrorist attack - wait, domestic or foreign?\"\"Foreign\".\"Okay, that helps. I could go all nerd on you and question just exactly what kind of disease organism we are talking about that can kill off 25% of Americans. Let alone the delivery method if it is water-borne, which would be quite complex and sophisticated and require large groups of people, precise coordination, a huge amount of communication somehow ignored by our federal agencies, split-second timing, and all the other unrealistic Hollywood movie script tropes that never work or even occur in real life\".\"Well, urban water supplies are hit with a bacterial weapon, something that pumps an enzyme that messes up neurons\".\"What did I just say about Hollywood plots? Look, 25% of 1996 US population is (googling) 66 MILLION people! And you are going to accomplish this by poisoning the water supply of urban areas? That's like practically every city in the US down to, places like, Sheboygan, Kansas City. That takes a lot of people to do that. And then there's your pathogen. That can only be a Soviet bioweapon. And the Soviets aren't around in 1996, and they didn't have anything remotely like that when they were around. And the Iraqis could not have come up with that. Even the bioweapons divisions of the Soviets, in their prime, in the 80s, would have had a hard time coming up with an effective water-borne pathogen, at least, one that is not virulent. You put something in the water that works the way you want, and kills of 25% of the US, it ain't gonna stop there. That is, as they say, a slate wiper.\"\"Well, see, they develop a vaccine, and -\"\"No. No. Stop. Just stop.\" I uncross my eyes after coming out of nerd fugue.\"Have you any conception of what the reaction would be to the deaths of 66 million Americans? Do you have even the slightest notion of the history of our nation? Any clues at all as to our national characteristics? Did you notice what happened after, say 9/11? Have you, perchance, thought about Pearl Harbor? Remember the Maine? Remember the Alamo? The Boston Massacre? Any, oh, I don't know, consistent pattern of behavior come to mind in any of that?\"\"...the Spaniards didn't blow up the Maine-\"\"WE AMERICANS GO FUCKING OUT OF OUR SKULLS APE-SHIT INSANE! THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS!\"\"...well, I said we went to war with Iraq. Gore has a lot of the same problems Bush had...\"\"Yes, yes. You did say that. So, 66 million dead, the largest death toll ever, in a cowardly, dastardly, sneak attack, and with the US military machine completely intact, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines practically tearing their teeth out in a white-hot urge to revenge themselves, with both conventional and nuclear forces unscathed and ready to be released in righteous wrath and anger against whoever did this, whoever is standing near whoever did this, for that matter, and you don't think there will be some over-reaction on our part? A nation that, in the best of times, is constantly teetering on the brink of isolationism and xenophobia, with a paranoid streak the size of a continent, and a sense of remorse worthy of a North Korean dictator? You don't think some mighty big smoking holes won't appear in the crust of the Earth? No. NO! All Hell would be unleashed. Rethink your story line\".\"...yeah, but, see, if-\"\"No. No. I don't buy a single bit of it. Go away!\"Phew. Sorry. I really should be more passionate about more important things.

{"title": "Contemporary Art", "date": "Thursday, September 30, 2010", "text": "The SF writer Theodore Sturgeon once said \"90% is crap\". This has been interpreted in various ways, but my interpretation is that 90% of what is out there is eventually destined for the dumpster. Don't matter what it is - art, literature, philosophy, scientific theory. In our Consumer Age, it is eventually recognized as crap, and tossed. And rightly so. Sometimes it takes longer than other times.It does not appear so in our Modern times, but I feel the encouraging trend is (hopefully) towards more sophisticated tastes and judgment.It will take some time before good taste finally kicks in. And so, throughout the Modern and Postmodern periods of Art, we, the viewing public, must put up with the usual symptoms: Self-adoration, leading to self-flagellation; strained attempts to seem \"fun\" and/or \"edgy\"; pitifully infantile use of shock and surprise to gain attention; ham-handed use of marketing attempts in 'branding', 'demographics', 'peak saturation', etc. and a confusion of brute force combinatorics and ADHD spontaneity with creativity and originality.Once again, I am insulted by the latest abuse of my senses by contemporary artists. This particular artist (work off to the right), whom I will not name so as to avoid providing even more recognition, sold a POS* hastily painted plastic skull for almost 20,000 Pounds. I've found it all to be quite embarrassing, to say the least.*Piece of ShitThese symptoms of disease in many respects ape and echo modern politics and society, and, I think, are really nothing more than an entirely human reaction to future shock. Things are changing faster than artists can comprehend. Science (at least since the atomic age) is much sexier than art, and real life is even stranger than fiction. How can you compete with this?Obviously, artists are not equipped to compete with this.Thus these stumblingly inept and awkward attempts at garnering attention. \"Look at me! Look at me! ME! ME! ME!\" doesn't work anymore. They are just one more voice in an incredibly unruly and even more noisome and obnoxious crowd. They really are, in a freak-show world of Predator unmanned fighter drones, inbred Mormon cult families, cannibal hobbyists, kamikaze Islamic fanatics, gun-totin', fuel-oil-and-fertilizer bombin' White Supremacists, reality TV, always, always at least two steps behind the times. Why, its a wonder that artists even try.It's not really the art world, is it? It's the world. I think Alvin Toffler was on to something with his idea of Future Shock. There's just too much information, too much acceleration, going on in the world, and anyone who wishes to be creative has either to try to ride the leading edge of the Wave (and fail, always), or find a nice spot behind it.I could say more but why?"},

As in \"Ask A Psychic\" wrong. Yeah, that wrong.Ah, but it is fun to play. Instead of saying how things will be, I will predict Ten Things won't be happening in the year 2030.1) There will be no supersmart superintelligent computers, like Hal or Skynet . Not because we ban them out of fear, but because we just can't build them. It turns out natural intelligence is hard enough to come up with, the artificial stuff is that much harder. Especially when attempted by beings whose first impulse is to fix things by banging them with their fists.2) (Easy one). No flying cars. Nope. Not a one.3) (Another easy one). No fusion power. (But the ongoing promise that \"fusion is just thirty year off\").4) I'm bucking the trend here. I was going to say 90% of Americans are obese and unable to move. Instead, I think there will be a return to the good old days. Only the rich will be fat, and will be proud of it. Everyone else will be lean, tough, and mean (although, scarcity might have something to do with it).5) Oil will be fifty cents a barrel. Everyone will run their electricity off of pure unadulterated cussedness. There will be a hole in the garage that you scream smoking radioactive blue profanities into. That's what powers everything. 6) Japan will be the 51st state. But the deal is, their robots run the show. USA heartily agrees. (contradicts 1? Nope. I didn't say they were smart robots. Just did a better job at running things than Americans).7) Vegetables are no longer grown in soil. Instead they are made from factory grown test tube meat.8) You can only join the armed forces if you are gay. (Because it turns out they make the best soldiers.

(Yes, I played Risk, and now regret it. I would sorely love to have those hundreds of hours of wasted time back). Ah, but there are a couple of points here. One thing, an ironic point, is how many global warming skeptics are suddenly warming (ah-ha-ha! funn-ny!)  to the idea of exploiting Arctic resources. Apparently, there is a ton of gas and oil up there, probably enough to get us all the way to the climate of Venus (which, see, is a joke, because, Venus is, like, hot, dude).  So, suddenly a lot of these conservative business-type deniers seeing the giant dollar signs floating in the sky over the Arctic circle, apparently now think that, gee I guess it is warming up after all, and that's a good thing!  The other point to notice is just how messy the ownership issue is. The five principal players are Russia, Canada, the US, Denmark, and Norway. There is currently a dispute over the Lomonosov Ridge , and whether it is an extension of Russia's continental shelf. If so, Russia gets just a whopper of a piece of the big pie.Of course, the others will do just fine - including the Heathen Selfish Socialist Billionaire Fishermen Who Come From the Place Where It Rains Too Much . Kind of makes me feel now, that my poverty-stricken ancestors made a big mistake coming to the US of A, but then Grandmom wouldn't have met Granddad and I wouldn't be here, or somebody else would.Honestly, not much to do except recognize that Yamburg (\"In Yamburg, frost bites you!\") may become a port of call and tourist destination.

You know, once I worked myself past the initial discomfort and suffering, and just settled into the whole experience of running, it was... joyful.It was flying. And you would think that the animal reference involves shutting down the front part of the brain, of getting back to some primal experience, when in fact it is nothing at all like that.It is a sensual experience. You are, formerly just a disembodied and angry ghost, fully re-engaged in your body. But not thoughtless, not the unthinking Be-Here-Now we ascribe to the animal. But fully conscious of your internal and external states. The speaking part of the brain is not silenced. Instead, it participates in the experience in kind of a happy babble, like a three-year-old, commenting upon each event. Sights, smells, sounds. Especially smells, the smell of late summer, of growth slowly turning towards autumn, of pungent and fecund life all about you. And sights.I recall running through a mid-to-young growth park and forest area on the northwest corner of the campus. Parkland, with trees spaced apart among the grass just right, sun and shadow perfectly proportioned, at least according to my evolution-honed senses and aesthetic.\"Oak tree!\" I remember thinking to myself.Now, it seems quite a silly thing to think. Yet at the time, this simple recognition evoked such a profound chain of thought that it is hard to now recount it. It involved such a connection to the world, such a deep affection with all the life around me, the sky, the sun, the air, the shadows, the palpable vitality of the flesh and the earth, that if I could but adequately describe you would possibly weep with joy.Yes, and it was not simply hedonism, not simply just sensualism, the intellect was fully involved, engaged, enamored, chattering away happily, and in concert with the experience.If I but had some telepathic way of relating this experience, you'd understand.But I think, being human, you do."},

It is packed in the cafeteria, not surprisingly as it is lunch. And, for the most part, I am struck by what a good-looking group of kids there are in the crowd.  And I also notice that this handsome crowd has practically every nationality and ethnic group represented - African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Hispanics, Whites, you name it.But that's not what I'm smiling about. What I'm smiling about is the fact that they are intermingled at every table.You see, when I was a kid, you would see the same representative diversity - but they would all be segregated at their own tables. Blacks would be at a black table. Asians at their table, etc. And that was a mere thirty years ago or so.But these kids, they are all... well, they are looking mighty American.

And shouldn't that apply to current events as well?Take the latest bullshit from a supposed law professor at the University of Chicago.My first impulse naturally to even question the existence of the Whining Professor M.

This reeks as the fiction of some political hack, the particularly frothy bowel product of some cubicle creature.I mean, the good professor just sounds too fucking stupid to actually earn that kind of coin, let alone have that type of job.

{"title": "The Carrington Flare", "date": "Monday, September 20, 2010", "text": "I lost power this past Saturday morning. Fortunately, since I have an electric stove, I had already made coffee. Fortunately, since I have a flashlight with batteries, I was able to brush my teeth and take a shower in my pitch dark bathroom. Fortunately, since I had to work, I did not have to spend any further time at home, with no TV, no computer, no music, no lights to read.It made me think, as every power outage does, how woefully unprepared I am for being thrown back into the first half of the 19th century. But I don't worry about it over much, because I live in the 21st century. No big deal, right?Oh, well, provided we don't have a solar superstorm, like the 1859 Carrington Flare.Named after the British solar astronomer who witnessed the five-minute-duration superflare emerge from a huge group of sunspots, it was the single largest solar eruption in record history. An aurora borealis, so bright you could read at night,  was seen as far south as Cuba. Telegraph wires, overloaded with charged particles, went haywire. Spark discharges shocked telegraph operators. And that, in 1859, was about that.Oh, but if it happened today? Well, all the satellites, all 900+ of them up there in orbit, are hopelessly fried. There is nothing we can do to shield them from the x-rays, charged protons, and detached magnetic loops that would fry them. The only thing to do is replace them. So, say good bye to cable TV, satellite radio, Internet, GPS, long distance phones for several years.Power lines and transformers would be overloaded. Say goodbye to electric power for (depending where you are) several weeks to several months. Let's hope its not during the winter.Like to drive? Got a generator? No gas. The pumps at the station are powered with electric motors. Like to drink water? Same deal. Like food? Same deal. In fact, technological civilization in the developed world is down for the count for at least several weeks. Probably several months.But then, if you watch one of those ghoulish masturbatory programs on Discover or History channel, you probably have already been spooked by this.So why bring this up now? Actually, this particular essay resulted from a conversation with particularly arrogant bonehead software engineer, who feels particularly invulnerable about his position in life right now. He has no sympathies for those less fortunate in the current economic climate. He considers them parasites, a ball and chain on successful hard-working Americans. He'd rather be \"dirt poor than accept a government handout\". In short, he's an asshole. Been raised as an asshole by assholes. Will always be an asshole and as already spawned asshole progeny. He and his selfish dipshit ilk will one day be responsible for the end of civilization as we know it.A solar flare would be just the thing to take him down a peg or two.Ah, but like all assholes, he's not worth it, nor would he learn from it.Certainly not worth the end of civilization to get an \"I told you so\" out of the deal."},
{"title": "Slaves in All But Name?", "date": "Friday, September 17, 2010", "text": "Will Durant once said \"Civilization exists at the consent of geology, subject to change without notice\". Anyone who doesn't believe or understand that..., well, let's hope Yellowstone doesn't blow up to empirically validate that statement.I offer a corollary: \"Your job exists at the whim of the market, subject to change without notice\".Do you owe rich people your job? From my perspective, that is a poorly disguised rationalization of feudalism. That's something a serf or a slave would say. \"Oh, thank you for my job, my lord\" with a tug of the forelock and an averted gaze kind of argument. That is Corporatism, which is just another version of Statism. My response to that argument, quite logically and bluntly,  is Bull-Shit. Market demand created your job. That rich person was merely a conduit of money. If you really beleive that rich people and corporations created your jobs, go and lick boots, you lackey, you hunchbacked henchman, you dung-covered stooge. Go back to Year 880 where you belong. You got no self-respect. You can't even admit the worth of your own labor. Anyone who insists that they were successful solely based upon hard work is a complete ignoramus.  They got a lot of explaining to do, starting off with how they managed to pop out of thin air with all of their talents developed, their faculties in full bloom, their knowledge intact, and the aching void of the market and society miraculously vacant - that empty seat at the banquet to be waiting just for their soft watery buttocks to show up and fill that special place.I'm sorry, no. Hard work alone did not get you to where you are. Luck. Luck is at least 70% of what you are. Lucky to be born in the developed world. Lucky to make it into adulthood. Lucky to be sound of wind and limb. Lucky to have the right kind of parents, teachers, mentors, coworkers, partially sane bosses, chance encounters, kind strangers, family, friends, neighbors that all lead to opportunity; in short, lucky to live in an egalitarian and lawful human society that nurtures and sustains you. If you refuse to recognize that, well, maybe we should ship you to Somalia or Mexico so you can truly understand your good fortune, what tyranny really means, what real hard work is like. No, I mean really real hard work. Really real hard work like really real starvation. Not \"I haven't eaten all day\" starvation. So, maybe, just maybe, you owe something back, and probably a lot more than you think you owe.  Which suggests still another maxim: \"The market exists at the consent of the governed\". Don't believe that? Read up on the French or Russian Revolution sometime. Or the downfall of the Soviet Empire. Those were a revolt against economic conditions. Markets swim within an ocean of government. There is no such thing as a free market. Markets do not exist without rules and laws of behavior. And, unless you are one of those goo-goo-eyed wobble-headed Libertarians of that crypto-anarcho-capitalist stripe that live in candy cane houses on gumdrop lane in candyland village and believes that everyone can get along and practice self-restraint, you recognize that markets are neither efficient, nor rational, nor self-correcting, and a certain amount of government restraint is necessary. The question then is how much. Which, on the five to ten dimensions of political identity, boils down to the merit vs. equality axis. What is fair? As a liberal, I appreciate merit more than a conservative could possibly know or admit, but I side on equality more than merit. The statement (amended to the more modern statement): \"All people are created equal\" is a statement so easily disproved, you wonder what was going through Jefferson's head. What a starry-eyed dreamer! Why the very idea of \"fairness\" is childish, no?Uh, well, no. It's the whole fucking foundation of what it means to be a civilized people. It's about time we got back to that."},

I don't know, maybe life was funnier back then, or maybe humor was simpler. Like, setting fire to cats, and pitting bears against a pack of dogs was funny back then. Maybe that kind of funny.And now it turns out that perhaps the reason they all wish to return to the past is because one of their ilk, a particularly backward-thinking individual named Dinesh D'souza, has discovered Obama's Dad's Time Machine .Yes, Obama's dad had a time machine, and Dinesh is now convinced that Obama is trapped in it. That's what he says: \"our President is trapped in his father's time machine\".I suppose Dinesh would prefer he get the President out (no doubt fulfilling a juvenile fantasy in the process), and use Obama's father's time machine for his own infernal ends.Perhaps to send all of us back to a simpler time? A time before all this infernal complexity made life so difficult? Perhaps the Stone Age? Or maybe stop the mating of Kenyan goatherds, so that Obama is never born, and thus save the future, which is the present, from an economic collapse?Well, we will never know, as Dinesh is obviously and unquestionably insane."},

It started out with video games. One parent was amazed at how his kids could play video games with a controller that had about \"three hundred buttons, switches, arrows and knobs\" on it.I mused \"We had, like, a joystick and a button\".\"Yeah, and now, I can't figure any of it out at all. I've just given up on trying to play video games with the kids\". \"Yeah, well, they been playing them since they was two. It's second nature to them.\"\"Well, look at remote controls on TVs. fifty, sixty, buttons. I'd much rather have an Iphone interface with symbols and pictograms, like I'm a chimp.\"\"Well, with electrodes and computers, the trend will head towards direct control through the brain. They are getting to the point where not only can you control machines with your brain, your thoughts can be read with computers \".\"I ain't wearing no bicycle helmet.\"\"Oh no. It'll be like a baseball cap or something\".\"Oh, fucking great. Electronic telepathy.

THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!\"\"Would it?\"Now I'm starting to wonder just how far in the future electronic drugs are? And I would define - since Google doesn't know about it - electronic drugs as the electromagnetic manipulation of the brain to provide alternate or modified experiences, emotions, and possibly... personalities.Think LSD on Acid.Techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation utilize magnetic impulses to stimulate or suppress nerve cells in the brain. This is often used as treatment for depression. Electromagnetic devices have also been used to possibly alter a person's moral compass . I'm assuming that as the technology advances, smaller and more specific brain regions can be modified. The ultimate progression would be technology that has complete and precise control over exact brain regions so that, say, the experience of playing with a puppy can be electronically simulated, or a bungee jump,  or the smell of a flower, or thrill of fear, or an impulse to steal, or, well, you see where this is going.On the one hand, it means creating the ultimate video game, the Mother of all Addiction.

{"title": "\"It\"", "date": "Tuesday, September 7, 2010", "text": "Long before, or perhaps at about the same time, James Lovelock came up with his Gaia Hypothesis, Gahan Wilson wrote an essay about \"It\".Gahan Wilson, who I am surprised to find is still alive, is a cartoonist in the same genre of dark, grotesque humor as Charles Addams. In his essay entitled \"It\", Wilson speculated that the Earth as a whole was an organism, which he called \"It\". He did Lovelock one better in assuming that this organism was teleological, that it had a will and a consciousness. (Lovelock, I think is careful to not assign any conscious will to the Earth, to avoid seeming a bit too New Agey and kooky). Wilson - since the essay, as I recall, was published in the National Lampoon - was under no compulsions to be all serious and scientific-like. His argument was that the Earth had decided to reproduce, and so \"It\" decided to evolve creatures that could move out into space, and take a baby \"It\" with them. \"It\" probably tried and failed a few times with evolving things. If the creatures didn't work out, the creatures would be folded back into the mix and a new attempt made. \"It\" doesn't really care so much about the creatures so long as they do what \"It\" wants, which is to develop space-faring technologies. If the creatures need to tear up parts of the planet, lay waste to some of the landscape to get at metals and resources and stuff, well, no problem. It's not like \"It\" hasn't been through worse throughout the course of Her 4 billion-year-plus lifetime.Wilson speculated (this is the 70s mind you), that the reason humankind was building megamalls and developing disgusting processed food was to get used to the cramped and unnatural living conditions expected in the journeys through space. Funny thing. Wilson came across something that may actually be true to explain trivial fads. (Although the processed food shtick is still going strong).I for one think Wilson may be on to something. I'm not all that serious about it, but it's an idea I can entertain. Not necessarily that \"It\" has any specific proposal in mind for us (or if it does I can only hope that it is sufficiently ironic and grotesque to satisfy my Wilsonian sense of humor). After all George Carlin speculated that maybe the Planet wanted Plastic, and the sole purpose of humankind was to give the Earth plastic. And now that we have done this, the planet is pretty much done with us, and we will all \"be shaken off her back like a bad case of fleas\".But I do think that \"It\" being the vast, lava-gutted, rock-hided, giant monster organism that \"It\" is, makes no small plans."},
{"title": "Was Kennedy Snookered?", "date": "Monday, September 6, 2010", "text": "It is not even October yet. It is not even fifity (fifity? fifty) years yet. The 50th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis is still way off in 2012. But I like to try and stay ahead of the pack.For a certain person of a certain age, the Cuban Missile Crisis is firmly implanted in their memories. It is a What If scenario that haunts them. A distant nightmare that has, like so much of life during the Cold War, warped and twisted their growth and development. Oh, not in any visible way, not in any traumatic emotional or experiential way, but in a cold, dry, academic way. Had matters gone slightly askew, many of us would not be alive. Many of us would have had a vastly different life than the life of comparative ease and plenty we have enjoyed. Many of us would have grown up stunted, brutish, and feral, in a post-nuclear landscape. Those of us who had survived. Those of us who had not been incinerated, buried, suffocated, irradiated, or mangled in the exchange of nuclear fire. Those of us who made it through the years of starvation, famine, plague, and predation by our fellow citizens. Those of us who, due to the circumstances and necessities of mere survival, were not quite entirely human anymore. It is a world that can be discussed, possibly even envisioned, but in no real way imagined. It is a mythology we can all do without.And speaking of mythology, quite a few myths sprouted from that crisis. Perhaps the biggest myth of all is the classic line from then Secretary of State Dean Rusk \"We were eyeball to eyeball and the other guy just blinked\". Well, movies have been made, books have been written, information declassified, and the tapes of the cabinet meetings released, and we now know that statement, like so much of American Cold War history, is pure and utter horseshit.To cite just one example, and there are many, the crisis was resolved by a secret agreement between Kennedy and Krushchev to remove recently installed American missiles from Turkey in exchange for the removal of Cuban missiles. No macho posturing. No staring eyeball to eyeball. It was, in the final days of the crisis, Kennedy, against the wishes of his trigger happy cabinet, doing some horse trading with Krushchev.Not all that surprising. Kennedy, after being bullied and lied to by the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Bay of Pigs fiasco, was understandably distrustful of them. Militarily, as Commander-in-Chief, he did exactly the minimum necessary amount, but no more. In the final analysis, the men in Kennedy's Cabinet, the \"best and the brightest\", were not so bright after all. And just as well!But here's the thing. All attention is paid to Kennedy, but hardly any to the guy who precipitated the crisis, Nikita Krushchev. Most people think of him from his visit to America. The blustering, bad-tempered, Russian circus bear of a buffoon. I mean, who else but a buffoon would listen to Castro, manufacture a crisis by foolishly deploying Russian nukes right in America's backyard?What kind of a buffoon? Why the kind of buffoon that managed to survive Stalin. That not only survived Stalin's inner circle, but managed to rise of power after his death. Someone that can do that is not a buffoon.Which makes me wonder. All the evidence was from aerial photographs. All of the Russian nuke missiles are there, but there is no evidence that they are armed with nukes. Is it possible that a smart old chess player in Russia decided that he might just be able to get something for nothing out of a young and inexperienced President? How do we know there were any nukes at all there? Did Krushchev snooker Kennedy?Well, the evidence now is that a handful of tactical nukes were in Cuba, and that's it. Those tactical nukes had a battlefield range, and yield (a few kilotons). But there is no indication that there were any strategic nukes in Cuba. I think the wily old Russians pulled one over on us. You know, sometimes you get the Bear. Sometimes the Bear gets you.And thinking about it, would Krushchev want to grant Fidel Castro access to strategic nuclear weapons?Not even a circus bear would do that."},

It's at that stage where the muscles ache, the throat scratches, the sneezing and coughing produce an alarming sheet-metal rattling in the lungs, and the headache in my eyes makes it hurt to look at things. So... my misery is your misery. Aren't I the nice one. Ready?We are in a Depression. \"Duh!\", you may say, or \"WTF you talkin' 'bout?\", but let me explain.I'm no economist, but my understanding is there is no rigorous, precise economic definition of what a depression is. There are definitions for recession, and so the prefered phrase for the latest national large-load-found-in-seat-of-pants is The Great Recession. Nah. We are way beyond that. We have moved beyond the Reagan recessions of '81-'82, the worst recession of '73-'75. In both those recessions, the job numbers bounced back eventually (though it took years), But this time out, those millions of jobs that were lost, they ain't coming back.(I can almost hear VP Biden right now, \"What the fuck, Kurman? Why do have to be such a smartass?\" Actually, VP Biden, I would think you'd be happy to hear that things were far worse all along. It gives you and President Spock, who is so puzzled by the illogic of us humans, some wiggle room, but regardless...)We are in a Depression. We have two examples of what depression is like. You have the Great Depressionof the 30s, which everyone knows about. And you have the Long Depression of the 1870s. History does not repeat itself, and, in fact, it does not even rhyme. But if we want comparisons, this current depression is more like the Long Depression.Have I got a name for it? I'll give you two. The Hidden Depression, and the Lost Empire Depression. Why these names? Because I feel we've been in a depression since 2002. The recent kerfuffle was an inevitable seizure of our national disease. You'll notice the common theme, which is any job growth over the past decade hasn't been real (kind of like the Reagan Recovery, and I'll explain, you'll see). GDP growth and job creation since 2002 has, once you take out health/education/military government expansion fueled through deficit spending, been zero. In fact, private sector (non health/ed/mil) growth has actually shrunk. Oh, sure, there were gains in 2005-2007, but they have all been more than wiped out. So, GDP growth, once you take fake Debt driven jobs out, especially the military defense ones, has been in the negative for the past decade. It's not just me, going with my highly unscientific and amateurish observations about the economy, there are others that have dug deeper on this.So, I got good news and bad news about this. Since you're Americans, I'll give you the bad news first. We can take it. right?No, actually, I'll give you the good news, which will take less time. The good news is, we are probably more than halfway through the depression. If I am correct, and it started after the Tech Bubble burst of 2001-2002, then we've got perhaps four or five more years of this shit. Maybe less, if something good comes out of Left Field.What's the bad news? We've got at least four or five years of this shit left, and it might get much, much, much, much worse. (Notice I'm checking my track record? I said the BP spill would last til Xmas. I'm completely wrong. The well will soon be plugged (HA!), but the damage will go well beyond Xmas). It might get much, much, much, much worse because, if I'm right, and any job creation we've had is through Debt driven government spending, then watch come next January 2011.Why? Well, the Teatards will be in power. John Boehner will be Speaker of the House. The motley collection of flipper-limbed dipshits that will occupy Congress do not have a clue as to how to get all those jobs back. But they will follow their Contract Out On America, and cut budgets, crank up the supply-side tax policies, eliminate regulatory agencies in favor of free market reforms. There will undoubtedly be a stock market rally, which basically will amount to a sugar high. But this rally will do shit as regards bringing jobs back. It will funnel more fake money into the pockets of the rich, and the fake money will be converted into real money as America continues to eat its seed corn by slowing killing off the middle class, burdening it with more debt both public and private. In fact, my prediction is that Republicans will do what they've always done, and make a bad situation even worse.Now, that's bad, because they still haven't touched the real debt problem. You got two choices. Cut social services, or you cut the military spending. Oh, they'll cut social services for sure. If they cut military, they pop the Defense Bubble, and that would produce more good news and bad news. They ain't gonna do that.So, ah, looking forward to 2020, at least!"},
{"title": "Yeah, about that heart", "date": "Friday, August 27, 2010", "text": "The picture I displayed in the previous online journal entry. That heart. That heart right here.Here's another picture of it.The first picture I photoshopped with a kind of sepia tone to it. The second picture is unmodified, unvarnished under fluorescent lights.The frame is stained poplar wood. The metal armature is sand-cast aluminum. The pattern for the casting was made from pink insulation foam, which I picked off pieces of the foam with my fingernails to give it the stippled texture. The aluminum is unfinished, basically untouched from the freshly cast state. I rather like the rough, crude look of the aluminum.The cast glass heart I am particularly proud of. It may be hard to see, but the surface is very fine. Unblemished, free of hairline cracks and bubbles. One of the better glass castings I've done. The mold was a champ. Not a single crack in it when it came out of the kiln. Here's a picture of the glass and mold in the kiln. There was a flower pot on top of the mold which I removed once the glass had dropped down into the mold. That explains the haphazard kiln stilts.People always ask if I am going to put a light behind it. As I've said before, since this seems an obvious thing to do, I resist it. However, details of the glass heart didn't see to pop out with a dark interior of the box, and so I put a mirror behind the glass. That seems to work, and provides a complementary material look between the glass and aluminum.This going with my standard material heuristic of formal, or semi-formal wood  frame, metal armature internal frame, and glass object. It seems to work for me, and I plan on continuing to use this presentation of materials well into the future.I've played with glass color, but lately I'm really enjoying just regular old translucent clear glass. (This is also a pragmatic choice, as I've run out of colored glass, but have plenty of clear cullet left). I'll make a few more before heading back into the cast bronze figurative realm.Oh, the tentative title? \"Por Vida\". I'm not married to that. I'm open to suggestions."},
{"title": "My Heart Was In It", "date": "Wednesday, August 25, 2010", "text": "This morning, I woke up with a great topic to write about. It was a worthwhile topic, an ennobling topic, one that got me excited, impassioned, curious, involved, and engaged.Damn if I can remember what it was now. I think instead I'll write about breaking stuff.I do like to break the shit out of stuff.  I prefer a manual breaking of stuff as opposed to using machines. I am not averse to artificial means of breaking stuff, like for example, explosives, projectile weapons, or fire. But there's just something about direct brute force, walloping on something with an implement of destruction, that provides a sense of accomplishment no other method provides. There is something about honest, hard physical labor, the complete embodied interaction between mind, muscle, and the shit to be broken, that just cannot be replaced.I'm reminded of a story from my youth. My father had bought himself a cottage from the Canadian government. It was in an abandoned fishing village called Jackfish, up on the north shore of Lake Superior. We ended up staying there two summers, under the most primitive 19th century living conditions. No electricity, no running water, an outhouse, a wood stove in the house. My chores were to carry buckets of drinking and washing water up from the lake, and occasionally chop wood. We built roaring bonfires down by the beach at night, sang songs, looked at the stars, wandered the hills, avoided bears, spooked moose, caught giant fish. It was probably the best two summers of my childhood.One day my brothers and I found a literal Viking horde of stashed weapons down in a fishing shed. They weren't weapons, just tools for cutting and hauling wood and stone, but to us they were superdestroyers, which is what we called them. Axes and adzes, long thick steel poles, things that looked like pikes (probably for the fishing boats) and giant mallets and sledge hammers. We were ecstatic, overjoyed, out of our fucking little minds with glee. Had we been allowed to, we would have laid waste to the entire village. Our father would not let us. He selected a particularly dilapidated old house, and let us loose on it. It was wonderful.And apparently I'm not the only one who feels this way. It being early in the semester, I've no work for my idiot student aides. We did have an abandoned piece of equipment that was going to be shoved into the dumpster. I gave them permission to beat the shit out of it before they threw it away. Aren't they happy?"},

{"title": "Temporal Baseline", "date": "Tuesday, August 17, 2010", "text": "There is one method of storing and accessing instructions in computer code which is sometimes called offset sequential. A baseline address is chosen, and then a count, or offset, is added to obtain the register address of an instruction. In other words, rather than number a set of statements from 1 to 100, I set the number of the first statement as 1, and then add a number to get whatever statement I want. So statement 67 would be 1 + 66, but I reference it as 66 (the add 1 is implied). This sounds kind of silly and pointless, but I save myself a digit in storing an address (statement 100 is stored as 99). When you have billions of memory addresses, the storage savings add up.I'm thinking we have the cultural equivalent of the offset sequential system, one that allows us to cross generations and slang to provide a commonality of understanding. And this baseline is 1960s television. This is the established baseline from which all culture now flows - even 50 years later. All references and associations from these TV programs are readily understandable because, well, because they never went off the air. They are still with us, and still watched.Thanks to reruns, syndication, the Internet, and cable TV, I am able to talk to my otherwise completely alien cute little student aide, Caitlin (pictured above), about things that we otherwise could not talk about.Case in point (and this is not an isolated anecdote, I have to do this all the time): She has put on some of her modern music (techno? electronica? I'm not sure), and listening to it, I mention that a particular piece sounds kind of Japanese, and not just because they are using electronic versions of Japanese instruments. \"They are?\", she asks, meaning they are playing electronic simulations of Japanese instruments, \"Like what?\"\"Well, I hear a koto. And also, I think, a shamisen\".\"What's that?\"\"It's like a three string banjo\". I get a blank look. (sigh) \"You know on the Addams Family, what Morticia plays? That's a shamisen.\"\"Oh.\"I rest my case. I wonder if, two hundred years from now, all cultural references will be based upon Star Trek, Batman, The Munsters, and every show from that era?"},
{"title": "The Drake Equation", "date": "Friday, August 13, 2010", "text": "Sir Francis Drake once calculated how many habitable worlds there are that could contact us, and came up with an answer of \"between at least one and at most infinite\". Glad he narrowed that down for everybody.Actually, no. Sir Francis Drake didn't do any of that. A guy named Frank Drake came up with an equation back in 1961. And it goes something like this:N = R*  x  fp  x  ne  x  fl  x  fi  x  fc  x  Lwhere:  R* is the average star formation per year in our galaxy  fp is the fraction of those stars that have planets  ne is the average number of planets per star that can support life  fl is the fraction that actually develop life  fi is the fraction that develop intelligent life  fc is the fraction that develop technology for communicating  L is the lifetime of that civilizationYes, you can tell right away that this is a silly equation. There are a lot of unjustified assumptions involved. Like, do you really need a planet to evolve life? Is \"life\" that a planet can support necessarily our kind of life?  Life that requires liquid water, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen? Why not life evolved in interstellar space, that likes hard radiation and zero gravity, and extreme cold? Why water babies snuggled up to yellow suns? Why DNA? Or even carbon-based? You get the idea.In other words, this equation is biased towards our kind of life, the only one we know. And though not particularly realistic when you look at what an extremely inhospitable - even downright hostile - universe we live in, at least we are looking for some kind of life that we could actually communicate with, in other words, life that is like us.Well, and then none of the above terms have a very accurate number attached to them. So the equation is quite silly. And yet - And yet - Ever since astronomers started looking, with super powerful telescopes and satellites, they are discovering planets around stars pretty much everywhere they look. Granted, not the kind of planets you would want to live on (the easiest ones to detect are massive Jupiter sized planets that orbit uncomfortably close to their stars), but it does much to bump up the number in that second term of the equation.And nowadays, they are starting to find planets that are more like ours. Granted, again, a lot of these planets are pretty darn massive and orbit close to the stars. Some are called \"Super-earths\", meaning they are much more massive than our lovely little planet, but are more likely rocky rather than gassy.  For category purposes, the masses of these big rocky planets range from 1 MEA (1 earth mass) to up to 10 MEA. Although technically, when you get a planet ten times as big as ours, it really is more like an ice giant, like Neptune or Uranus.  Yes, even close to the sun, it would be an ice giant. Reason is there is more than one kind of ice. Put water under enough pressure, and it forms and ice called Ice X, which is solid ice, but at temperatures hundreds, even thousands, of degrees above our \"freezing point\". A planet with a lot of water may have world-drowning oceans hundreds of miles deep, and that is enough pressure for ice to form.Of course, there are a lot of factors to get life on our world. There's the \"Goldilocks\" factor - being in the right orbit for liquid water to exist on the surface. As it turns out, the Earth is just outside the Goldilocks zone. Why don't we freeze solid? Well, we did, about 700 millions years ago, during the Snowball Earth period. What matters is what your atmosphere is composed of. For the longest time, there was a lot of CO2 in our atmosphere, which kept things freezing, but oxygen-pooping algae and bacteria ate it all up, and things froze solid.It's not only the right-sized orbit, it's also maybe about having a moon, and a big Jupiter midway out in the solar system to clear out bombarding asteroids and comets. And having a world made out of the right kind of stuff.Under different conditions, with different concentrations of chemicals in the cloud that the solar system formed out of, this planet of ours could have ended up as an iron world, like Mercury, with little or no rocky mantle, and probably no water. For that matter, we could have ended up as a carbon world like Saturn's moon Titan, with a diamond core, and hydrocarbon seas of gasoline and a methane atmosphere. Or a water world. Or a carbon-monoxide world.  The point is, it takes a lot of IFs (the factors in the Drake equation) to get to our particular world even before you get to populate it with life. And once you are there, there is a good chance that IF life evolves it may be carbon-based, water-nurtured, eventually oxygen-breathing, multicellular life like ours, but life like us? Exactly like us?Ooh-ah. Those are some really high odds. Astronomical."},
{"title": "Soft Corinthian Leather", "date": "Sunday, August 8, 2010", "text": "It has come to my attention that Newt Gingrich is very upset about a place called Cordoba House.Why he is upset over a house named after the Chrysler Cordoba is at the very least a puzzlement to me.What problem, exactly, does he have with a mid-sized luxury coupe manufactured between 1975 and 1983, with, as Chrysler described it, a \"quiet Spanish motif\"? One that sported a 383 cu in two barrel carburator V8 engine, automatic transmission, power steering, and a \"golden tone\" AM radio? One that used none other than late, great Ricardo Montalban as its advertising spokesperson? To show any dislike towards a house dedicated to the Chrysler Cordoba, with its soft Corinthian leather is, by implication, to heap disrespect upon the star of \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\".This is unaceptable. Modify your reality, Mr. Gingrich.As a matter of fact, maybe historian Gingrich should occupy his time with more important issues. Like for instance:When the Reliant visits Ceti Alpha 6 thinking it is Ceti Alpha 5, they didn't notice a planet was missing? I mean, they have all sorts of sophisticated navigation instruments and techniques in the 23rd century, they couldn't even count the number of planets around the sun? Didn't Kirk leave a log entry after they marooned Khan and his party there? They don't check to see if there is information when they visit a system? This is an important movie continuity issue."},
{"title": "\"I am the Past, Come Back to Haunt You\"", "date": "Thursday, August 5, 2010", "text": "I get a phone call last night. I normally don't answer my phone. I let the machine do it. But for some reason, I picked up. The best description of the call - and my reaction - was as if, out of the ordered chaos of the universe, a message beamed from a star 35 light years away had arrived and was mysteriously being transmitted through my phone. It was an old buddy from high school. Out of respect for privacy, for purposes of internet anonymity, we'll call him Rich.It was either Abraham Lincoln, or Mark Twain, who said \"A lot of smart young men come from Indiana. And the smarter they were, the sooner they left\". Rich was one of those young men. Although his ultimate destination, Wichita, Kansas, makes me question his intelligence. \"Wichita\", I think, is old Indian for \"Hey, let's settle here in the middle of a goddamn semi-arid continent with fat-broiling summers and bone-chilling winters. It'll be just like Siberia but without the swamps!\"The result of talking to Rich was release of a whole flood of fun memories. True, vague and semi-detached memories sampled from cannabinoid damaged brain circuits, but fun ones nonetheless. I can't recall what grade, but he moved into town when we were going to Thomas Jefferson Jr. High (now Middle School). Rich was a goofy looking kid with thick glasses and even thicker wiry hair. (To be fair, it wasn't that Rich alone was goofy looking, at that age we all were, with different body parts growing at different rates). He liked to call me \"moron\" a lot, but it was more like \"MOR-ron!\" I never took offense, as I'm sure I called him a lot worse, given my early and ongoing fascination with creative profanity. The only time I took offense was when he called me an \"ambisexual moron\". I think I took offense because he knew a word I didn't, and I had to go look \"ambisexual\" up. I think I met him in band. We both played trombone. For a time, there was a healthy rivalry at who would be First Chair. (At a recent party, my brother mentioned to a woman that I played First Chair in band. She looked me up and down like I was a slack-jawed meatslapper, which at the time I was, since I'd had a few beers. \"You're. Kidding.\" was her response.)In Junior High, I was First Chair with no real competition. Rich supplied that. We swapped first chair position a few times, and then I discovered Dope. So much for the competitive spirit and musical ambitions. Actually, band was a fun time. It was easy to make Rich laugh, and I always enjoyed the rictus of panic that would strike his face when I got the band director pissed off at us (well, at me, but Rich was seated next to me and feared guilt by association).The band director and I had an intense mutual dislike for each other. He considered me undisciplined and slovenly - a slacker (which I was). I considered him an authoritarian prick (which he was). I think he's dead now.I had a dream about the band director once. He said to me in the dream \"John, I apologize for being a prick. But I did it for your own good\". I replied \"I accept your apology, you fucking prick\".   Good times!"},

Pinker can kiss my exquisitely sculpted manly butt cheeks.I have in the past suggested that music and rhythm do have a basis in survival, both as a social bond, and (my own hypothesis) as an aid to running. My idea being 1) we are running apes, 2) that a runner that can keep time uses his/her body more efficiently (time/motion studies bear this out), and 3) a runner that can sing while running is in better shape than one that cannot, and therefore is more fit and attractive to the opposite sex and fits in well with Darwinian selection and all that shit that Pinker blathers on about. It also helps to be a good dancer.Well, we all know that music can evoke emotions - pound for pound - better than anything else.

{"title": "\"Money Is Too Important To Be Left To The Rich\"", "date": "Monday, August 2, 2010", "text": "Who said that? I said that, borrowing from Georges Clemenceau. Reading through the catalog notes of the Great Exhibition of 1851 (the famous \"Crystal Palace\" exhibition intended to display the wonders of modern technology from around the world), I found this dismaying and disheartening entry:\"The absence in the United States of those vast accumulations of wealth which favour the expenditure of large sums on articles of mere luxury, and the general distribution of means of procuring the more substantial conveniences of life, impart to the productions of American industry a character distinct from that of many other countries. The expenditure of months or years labour upon a single article, not to increase its intrinsic value, but solely to augment its cost or its estimation as an object of virtu is not common in the United States. On the contrary, both manual and mechanical labour are applied with direct reference to increasing the number or the quantity of articles suited to the wants of a whole people and adapted to promote the enjoyment of that moderate competency which prevails among them\"I consider it a point of pride that, when Queen Victoria toured the American section of the Exhibition, she found it all \"certainly not very interesting\", given that the everyday items displayed lacked the grandeur of the tapestries, sculptures, and other luxurious items of neighboring sections. We, as a nation, had not yet engaged in a jaded dissipation, in an exhaustion of resources to coddle and support the idle rich. Yes, I said support the rich, for it is my view that we Americans who are in the lower 99% wealth bracket labor to support the uppermost 1%.  It is one of the most insidious pieces of propaganda foisted upon the public that the idiot rich are somehow the \"producers\" in American society. They are the parasites. The parasites are not brown skinned. They are not Hispanic. They are not Negroes. The parasites are pasty white people sailing on yachts and driving foreign cars, and if things keep on going the way they are going, they are going to be eaten soon.You have only to remind yourselves that the party of the rich, the Republicans, when they occupied the Presidency and held a majority in Congress, crafted TARP. TARP, keep in mind, bailed out the rich. The taxpayers monies went to the pay off the banks' creditors  - those who had gambled and lost. Any ordinary citizen would have been, oh so sorry, better luck next time,  out a chunk of change. But the party of the FYIGM (Fuck You I Got Mine) gave the Wall Street bloodsuckers a do-over. I am astounded, simply astounded, that the American public is not more furious at the big banks, the Wall Street parasites, and the Republican party (yes, I know, the Democrats helped tremendously in screwing this particular pooch, but the Republicans were at the wheel. Obama is going to own this mess shortly, if he already doesn't, but credit where credit is due). And all this after a decade of pitifully moribund growth, zero job creation, barely incremental income rise for the middle and lower classes, where the upper 1% saw a completely obscene and utterly disgusting fourfold rise in income, the Bush Tax Cuts made them all even richer. AS if that was necessary. All because we are told that somehow, the rich would throw us a sop, and we poor working slobs'd see more jobs, higher income, and new industries as the rich invested in a productive America. And instead Biff and Buffie's trust fund managers (who Mumsie and Papa appointed so that Biff and Buffie wouldn't blow their inheritance on cocaine and Magic Beans) threw it all down one banker's scam-hole after the next. And then, AND THEN, the bankers had the gall to go before the Fed and say \"Hey, that's a really nice economy you got there. It would be a shame if anything happened to it\".Talk about a massive restribution of wealth. Talk about in the wrong direction. And yet, somehow, the American public is convinced that the wealth is flowing the opposite direction and it is rampant socialism. What. A. Load. Of. Crap.Example: Take this piece of shit. Here is the fucking moron who provided the philosophical underpinning of supply-side economics - Arthur Laffer. He should be tarred and feathered for that alone. Laffer complains that allowing the Bush Tax Cuts to lapse is nothing more than soaking the rich, and we shall see such a calamity as has not been seen in his lifetime. Ah, newsflash, Artie, the economy (the one you said was doing GRRR-REAT! in 2007) ain't doing so hot, and ain't gonna see much of a difference if the cuts expire. And if you need an example, look at when Reagan raised taxes in the depths of his recession. What happened? Not much. So, Artie, shut the fuck up. The rich are not managing their (formerly our) wealth very well. Time for someone else to take a crack at it.It would be nice to see all that money do something worthwhile for a change. Like, oh, I don't know, be invested among thrifty, courteous, honest, productive, hard-working small businesses, so that we could all get back to work again?  The ax is an essential tool in anyone's toolbox. Even now. The interesting thing is, it did not reach its current ergonomic form until spending some time in the Americas. Early American tool kits would have contained hatchets, saws, chisels, adzes, hammers, mallets, augers, gimlets, bit braces, and axes. Most of the tools in size and shape were little changed from those used in the Middle Ages. Few new ones were changed or added. It may be that, according to Rob Tarule \"to introduce a new tool may cause a sufficient disruption of the total system of tool use to be actually more hindrance than aid\". Indeed, this might explain the hundreds of centuries of little technological change we see in both historic and prehsitoric times. Rather than any form of social conservatism, it might instead be a holistic pragmatism that stifled innovation and progress. This would be in keeping with my contextual view of history. At any rate, the heavy, awkward axe brought over from England (and again, one looks at use, this axe was a very effective battlefield weapon), had devolved into a light, balanced axe with a more massive head. It took a deeper bite out of a tree with less effort.  The bit, or cutting edge of the American axe was broader, allowing more momentum with each swing, and the handle was given a length and curve appropriate to the height of the axman. The axe swung straight and clean. A wielded American ax wielded by even a novice could fell three times as many trees as the European counterpart.I would make the suggestion that the reason for this was because there was a lack of specialized division of labor in early America. The myth that the reason so many things became so quickly mechanized was due to a shortage of skilled labor really should be debunked. There was no lack of skilled labor, the obvious fact is there was a lack of demand for skilled labor. Remember, they are starting from scratch. There is, at the beginning, a large demand for generalists. It should not be surprising that a quick evolution in tool usage and tools would occur for tools to be used, not by specialists, but by inexperienced generalists. Generalists who circumstances have forced to specialize over a broad range of tasks. Couple this with the usual information exchange (voluntary or in-, e.g. the modern \"open source\" or traditional \"open shop\" mentality, or through plagiarism and idea theft), and you get yourself some changes.Generalists performing tasks never before done, with no fund of skills to draw from. One finds a certain amount of intelligence and expertise crafted into the tool, to make up for the lack of experience of the wielder. Is this a common pattern in innovation? I suspect so. It would be interesting to find out."},
{"title": "Are We Here Yet?", "date": "Wednesday, July 28, 2010", "text": "If I were required to pick one overarching theme for America, I would perhaps suggest that it is the elimination of the difference between \"here\" and \"there\". The difference is not just physical, but metaphorical as well. The pathways and networks we have created have gone from canals and roads, highways, rails, and rivers, to wires and fibers, airwaves, and spectra.We are told that these have aided the democratic process, either through enhancing our freedom of movement, or by expressing ourselves through near instantaneous communications. I'm not so sure. I've always felt that progress had a Newtonian component to it - that for each action there was an equal and opposite reaction. That for each obvious gain, there was a oftentimes subtle corresponding loss. Although usually this loss was in a sideways or lateral direction, as movements within the sphere of social direction are, but eventually it was felt and noticed, and occasionally lamented.Take the automobile, the popular use of which is less than a century old. For all the freedom and convenience it has brought us, it has also brought congestion, pollution, urban sprawl, and possibly even a fundamental alteration of lifestyle through climate change and dependence upon oil from hostile regimes. Take the railroad, without which the entire system of mass production could not have occurred. There is no doubt that this system has resulted in prosperity and a more egalitarian standard of living regardless of social standing. Getting goods to market, in large quantity, to places that canals and rivers and trails could not easily reach has produced a change to our economy of near geological proportions. And yet railroads also gave us the curse of  the modern corporation, organizations so large they rivaled sovereign nations in power, and rivaled governments in terms of bureaucratic incompetence and indifference. Not to mention railroads helped to usher in the age of consumerism, mass consumption and planned obsolescence.The telegraph, telephone, radio and television, the network of computers have shrunk the distance between individuals, strengthened the links from person to person. I am still amazed, today at what a monumental change the telegraph was. It is hard to imagine the impact. News and information which took days, weeks, even months to travel took suddenly mere seconds. The modern day equivalent would be nothing short of teleportation - to travel to any spot in the world and arrive in just moments as opposed to hours or days.There certainly has been a  leveling of the playing field with regards to access of information. There was a time when facts and figures were held by the privileged few, jealously guarded and hoarded, and information parceled out only sparingly and miserly. Now, anyone with a smartphone and a university of google degree can look like an intellectual. There are moral hazards to this wired world, however. Flash traders, those companies with the fastest networks and the hottest supercomputers, with advanced financial models, can profit from a timing difference in  just milliseconds. And people may have any fact and figure to hand, but not the slightest idea of how to connect them, or how to act wisely with this information.In short, we as individuals, despite being empowered and enhanced by space and time destroying technology, are also shackled and diminished by it. Despite the elimination of distance and duration, we are still here. As the saying goes \"No matter where you go, there you are\". I guess we need to be more mindful of that."},

Not a damn thing. And the weird thing is, it's like, I've got all the pieces. I've got the data, I've got the connections. I've got the associations. I even have a hint of a pattern as to what and where I should go. I just need a thousand more brain cells, or a 50 point bump up in my IQ to get there. And that ain't gonna happen. So I'm frustrated, and there's nothing I can do about it but wait. Now I know how he feels. You know, the guy in the piece called \"Immersion\".My Traditional Metal Casting class has one more session, but yesterday evening was the last casting night. Which means I'm done pouring molten metal in above 80F temperatures wearing a silver jacket. Which means I don't lose ten pounds of sweat once a week.Not that I'm complaining. I very much enjoy pouring molten metal. And it's not a pyro thing either. It's a very relaxing activity. Some people meditate or play the piano or collect and examine stamps. I pour hot molten metal.I'm not sure it is a guy thing. I've had female students who feel the same way I do about it. It's not thrilling or exciting or an adrenaline rush, or at least not after the first time. It is possible that the heat has a lot to do with it. It is a rather warm and toasty experience.I do know what is a guy thing. The book I'm reading now \"Nuts and Bolts of the Past: A History of American Technology, 1776-1860\" by David Freeman Hawke. You laugh at what a guy book that is, but no, you are reading the prose of a guy who read, and would readily re-read \"The History of Coal\". I will, without a doubt, find and read books from this book's bibliography, like \"Tools for the Job: A Short History of Machine Tools\" by L.T.C. Holt, or \"Studies in the History of Machine Tools, by Robert S. Woodbury, or \"Early Engineering Reminiscences\" by George Escol Sellers.It is a time, a time when mechanicians roamed the land, which does more than slake my curiosity. I suspect that I and my family were born two hundred years too late. We would have fit in well with those early engineers and technologists.One of the more intriguing books is \"The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Idea in America\", by Leo Marx. Early America, America east of the Appalachians, blessed as it was with a plenitude of rivers and streams, was at first a Green Industrial America. True, there was no shortage of wood to burn, but Americans back then saw it more fit to make things from wood, seeing as we had not quite reached the age of steel. And given the availability of water power - water in rivers and streams that were not as sluggish as in the British Isles, but not so wild as rivers to the West - it was only inevitable that factories and machines were powered through the use of the millrace and the waterwheel.And so industry, run by water, was a bit less concentrated in large towns. Even the small hamlets and villages had some form of industry run by water. And these industries, not producing thick choking blankets of coal or wood smoke, tended to be light open airy affairs - almost quaint. What then, was the problem? Why the eventual reliance upon the stationary steam engine? Well, quite simply, the seasons were the problem. Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall. Or, in more pragmatic terms, Ice, Flood, Drought, and Choke. (Choke being the annual silting, branch and leaf dropping which clogged dams and spillways).A shop or factory or mill usually could not depend upon a turning waterwheel for more than 160 days a year. I suppose it was inevitable that steam and coal and hydrocarbons should usurp the renewables.Still it is interesting that we turn to them again. My understanding is that, as of 2004, more than half the generating stations in America are renewables. A step in the right direction regardless of your politics? Perhaps. I'd like to see better and more efficient use of what we have. That would be step in the right direction."},
{"title": "Kurman's Law", "date": "Sunday, July 18, 2010", "text": "Niall Ferguson is a historian who thinks there is some worth in working through counterfactuals.Counterfactuals, alternate histories, (\"What if the South won the Civil War? What if JFK had not been assassinated? What if Napoleon had won in Russia?\" etc.) have had quite an extensive fictional treatment.Ferguson's counterfactual analysis, from a historical standpoint, is less about a \"what if?\" story, and more an examination of the context and contingency of historical events, and the role that people - and luck - play in them. \"For want of a nail...the kingdom was lost\", etc.The deceased biologist and popular science writer Stephen Jay Gould wrote several treatments about this with respect to Nature. His views of contingency and determinism lead him to the statement that if: \"You could rewind the tape of Life, it would never play the same way twice\".I think the technique is not without merit, and no doubt history is neither fixed nor inevitable, but the one thing that is not covered in these thought experiments is, not what would happen afterwards, but what would it take to get there?I recently had a discussion in which the question \"What if Hitler's labor camps were just that?\" Labor camps, not extermination camps, but camps as portrayed in their propaganda? And the consensus was that Germany would obviously still have lost the war, but wouldn't have had to deal with the Holocaust, and the obvious eternal stigma. Israel most likely would not exist. Perhaps European governments, in reacting as they did to right-wing totalitarianism, may not have been as socialist.But I thought of a more interesting question for this counterfactual, which was, \"How could you even get to that situation?\" I've asked this question before when the subject of \"What would it have been like if the South won the Civil War?\" (Let me get back to that in a minute).How could Hitler and the Reich possibly have set up camps that did not exterminate Jews? And I would suggest that among the likely requirements for this to occur would be that Hitler could not be an anti-Semite. And, for that matter, when you consider that anti-semitism was endemic in Europe, the elimination of this condition would also be required. In short, the very reasons for Hitler's election and rise to power, as well as Germany's initiation of war, would need to changed in such a way that Hitler would never rise to power.What would it take for the South to win the Civil War? I would argue that in order for the Southern states to whip the North, they would need a vast industrial base, good transportation, a well educated populace, and perhaps even a change in demeanor of whites in the South in a more curious and enthusiastic embrace of science and technology. In short, Southerners would have needed to develop the resources of the South without the use of chattel slavery. And if slavery did not exist, which perhaps would have allowed them to win, the war would never have occured.I think you may see where I'm heading here, but if not, I'll just spell it out. The requirement to change the contingencies of history is such that the contingencies would never exist. In short, a paradox. Kurmans' Paradox (since I've found nothing in the literature which quite phrases this useless insight in the way I've described, I claim title to it). Or if you want a more time-travelly flavor:Kurman's Law: \"Any contingent change in history to alter the outcome of a turning point causes the turning point to cease to exist\"."},

This has become something of a mantra among the so-called conservatives, anarcho-libertarians, and anti-government free-market enthusiasts for some time. Not much logic in this simple-minded platitude. And I mean \"platitude\" in its most insulting form, since those who go by these stupidly thoughtless pigheaded mantras insist upon saying idiotic things in a jackass kind of way.I would argue that these people don't remember their elementary school lessons, or have chosen to be ignorant of them. But, okay, let's say that they are right. Let's do this scientific-like, and go with that hypothesis, and see if we can find any empirical evidence that contradicts this. (I'm pretty sure I could write a book-length treatment to drive the point solidly into their little pinheads, but who would want to read it?) So, Resolved: Government does not create wealth. Contradictory evidence? Anyone?Land PurchasesThe Louisiana Purchase. Remember that? President Jefferson authorizes the purchase from Napoleon. Napoleon snookers Spain (since France didn't actually own the land) into trading land west of the Mississippi in exchange for an Italian Kingship for one of the idiot inbred Hapsburg princes, then reneges on the deal, and pockets the$15,000,000 from Uncle Sam. Fifteen million in 1803 dollars is about two hundred fifteen million in 2010 dollars. With the acquisition of 828,800 square miles, that works out to $259 a square mile, or 40 cents an acre. What's the average land value west of the Mississippi now? A thousand bucks? On average? More? A lot more? And that's just land. Let's not forget to mention minerals (gold, silver, lead, iron, platinum, copper, uranium, oil, natural gas, you name it), forests, plants and animals harvested (those buffalo hides made a lot of leather belts to run factory overheads back East), just for starters. To I need to continue? How much did we get out of that deal, so far. A couple dozen trillion dollars? More? What was the return on investment on that deal? Anyone? Seward's Folly. The purchase of Alaska. We got an even better deal on that. Five cents an acre!Wars of ExpansionThe Mexican War was not exactly our country's finest hour, but we got a lot more land out of it. Texas. California. The Southwest. You don't suppose any money was made on that, right? How about killing off and corralling all those Injuns? Got 'em out of the way for the settlers. The Spanish-American War. Okay, that didn't work out so well, but we did make a buck off our territories for a short while.Socialist Legislative ActsIf providing for the betterment of the community through federal agency is socialism, then maybe you should call all of these projects communist as hell.You know, if you look closely at Abe Lincoln's record, the fucker was a Major Commie.

NASA only jump-started a thousand companies with government subsidies.Congress subsidized the telegraph.

The entire communications backbone of the Uinted States of America is built upon that. Government funded research and development. Money to keep the lights running, while companies let their employees dick around in the basic sciences. Yeah. Nothing came out of that. Only radio, television, the transistor, computers, radar, lasers, CDs, DVDs, flat screen TVs, atomic energy, atomic bombs, jet planes...

{"title": "Zombie Ideas", "date": "Monday, July 12, 2010", "text": "There are smelly old ideas, wrong-headed notions, unnecessary assumptions, unwarranted premises, invalid axioms, that, if they could, should reek of decay and death. They are zombie ideas. Ideas that should be dead, but continue to exist, to be active, to thrive, to walk the earth like the living... like zombies.They continue because they are coddled and swaddled inside the heads of stupid people. If you could smell the ideas, you'd never, ever let them enter your head, unless, of course, the inside your head was suffused with the rotting stench of death already, which I figure is what the insides of the heads of stupid people smell like. And not just any kind of stupid people, but Class IV Stupids: the ones that can process, retain, assemble, conclude, but then willfully ignore information. They got rotten brains. Rotten brains holding smelly old ideas.Things like phlogiston, Flat Earth theory, geocentrism, the luminiferous aether, the caloric fluid, memes, and the rational market, to name just a few.Libertarians love the rational market hypothesis. Libertarians are fucking idiots.Take Milton Friedman and Jimmie Savage. They proposed that people, regular folks,  made economic choices according to rational decisions derived from complex statistical rules. When the obvious objection was made that this was just plain fucking ridiculous, because people are generally irrational goddamn animals, driven by greed and fear, who panic to buy and panic to sell, Friedman and Savage countered that billiard players do not calculate the mathematical physics equations behind their shots, but nonetheless act as if they did.  In other words, when Friedman had to choose sides between empirical evidence and convenient theory, theory won out, and to hell with the facts.Friedman's argument was:   the relevant question to ask about the \"assumptions\" of a theory is not whether they    are descriptively \"realistic\", for they never are, but whether they are sufficiently   good approximations for the purpose in hand. And this question can be answered only   by seeing whether the theory works, which means whether it yields sufficiently  accurate predictions.                                                                                - The Methodology of Positive Economics 1953Apparently, Friedman never studied the history of science. Take epicycles. The ancient astronomer Ptolemy, in trying to describe retrograde motion (the seeming temporary backward motion of planets in the sky) within the theoretical framework of a geocentric - an Earth-centered - universe, had to rely on the use of epicycles. In this model, planets did not directly orbit the Earth, but actually orbited in a small circle, called an epicycle, which travelled along a large circle, called the deferent, which orbited the Earth. This model of Earth at the center of the universe, with some planets traveling around in circles within circles stood for nearly 1500 years. The model (per Friedman above) used \"sufficiently good approximations for the purpose in hand\" and provided \"sufficiently accurate predictions\" of motion of planets in the sky. It was therefore, by Friedman's standards, a perfectly acceptable theory.It was also completely full of shit. Try launching a rocket into space and navigating the solar system using epicycle navigation. You'll fly up your own asshole before you even get to the Moon.Phlogiston (FLAH-jist-on) n: Obsolete term. A hypothetical substance once thought to be responsible for combustion. The material or elemental form of fire released as flame. Coined by physician/alchemist Georg Stahl (1660-1734). The Phlogiston theory was destroyed mainly by the great aristocrat and tax collector, Antoine Lavoisier, who almost single-handedly created modern chemistry. In recognition of this, French hippies cut his head off during the Terror.In college, I read an excellent book, \"The Art of Probability\" by Richard W. Hamming. It is probably the best cautionary textbook for practitioners of statistics. Hamming used that phrase \"art\" for a very good reason. In all his years of examining the calculations and models of computer scientists and mathematical physicists, time and again he discovered that these models and calculations, being perfectly correct and consistent in math and logic, and producing extremely reasonable results - were based on incorrect assumptions, or were, even worse, simply modeling the wrong thing! And as such, there was a certain artistic component in the field of mathematical modeling and theory. Not so much an aesthetic component, as, for example, the way Einstein would speak of the beauty or elegance of equations. But rather more in a gustatory sense, as in a cook checking whether the ingredients were fresh, to avoid spoiling a recipe. If it smells like shit, don't eat it!You'd have thought that the Crash of 2008 would have driven a stake through the heart of the idea of the rational market - and the notion of the productive class, for that matter - and that would be the end of it. But no, plenty of rotten brains out there, and plenty of shitty ideas."},

I call it a blog (in my mind a disparaging term, akin to \"bad TV show\") because, after getting twinges of regret for some time, I've come to the conclusion that it is vicious and mindless entertainment posing as leftist political commentary.Why did I give up on it? Well, it didn't happen all at once, but the final straw was they were making fun of rednecks.Wh-at? Making fun of...? SO?I know! I know! I mean, who cares, right? It's like making fun of bad tattoos, or worse haircuts. But the fact of the matter is those are choices, whereas being a redneck is more situational, more blameless nurture than bad fashion statements.I love, well, I don't love, I enjoy making fun of the great unwashed, as did many of America's best humorists. Mark Twain did an excellent job for one. But here's the thing, Twain may have poked fun, but underneath the humorous insult was a clear and abiding identification of, and affection for, the basic humanity of the redneck.Whereas the place I gave up on, the supposedly liberal poster, and his sycophantic coterie of buttlickers, are just downright nasty. Humorless humor. Non-egalitarian. Pitiless snobs. Snobs convinced of their own superiority. In other words, the very stereotype of liberal butt-head that conservatives think, well, that liberals are. Smug superior snobs, unwilling to rub elbows with the great unwashed, more than ready to suggest that they bathe, and do many other things to make themselves presentable to \"polite\" society. In other words, British colonial officials talking about the savages they live amongst. I realized that I didn't like these people at all!It reminds me of when I first ventured onto the internet message boards, before most of them died a well-deserved death, and I came across a forum of the Skeptic magazine. At first, reading the threads and discussions, I decided that these seemed like likable and intelligent people. Well, middlebrow intelligent, no real brilliance or genius level types there. And then after a bit, I realized that the prodding and poking of \"believers\" is not quite all in fun. I realized that these people are snobs! I realized that these snobs with undeserved and unrealistic (and therefore unhealthy) self-images of intellecutal superiority, merely because they didn't beleive any of the silly things that others did. And by this method, came to think they really were genius level types, when their prose, and arguments proved they weren't. You know, exactly like that douchebag, Richard Dawkins - mindlessly, inflexibly, nastily, caustically, ignorantly intolerant.Exactly like the so-called liberals that I recently got fed up with on the blog I will not mention.I'll hang with the liberal who will poke fun of people, but if they see that feelings have been hurt, is ready to lie and say \"Oh, we didn't mean it. We're sorry!\". You know, the ones that have to live in society, with other people.

TARP was there to pay off the bank's and investing houses debt-holders. Had this not happened, I don't see how we could have avoided a depression and  30% unemployment. But we have to recognize what actually happened. Oh sure, some banks got bailed out, but what really happened was the bank's creditors got paid off. Its important to recognize this. The whole crisis occurred because the money flow was frozen. The economy was constipated.Had debt holders not been paid off, no more money would have been lent out. No more money flow. That was the problem. Still is. The government did its damndest to get the money flowing again, with a hefty dose of Metamucil in the form of the stimulus. That's what government is supposed to do. They could no more, but the asshole Republicans and Teabaggers idiots worried about inflation and the size of the debt are making so much noise that Congress ran for cover. These same idiots, unaware that the big problem is deflation and real depression from lack of a further enema jolt to the system in the form of another money stimulus.So, it's up to the private sector now. The problem is, they are holding onto cash. Companies have record amounts of cash. We have a nation of corporate clenchpoops.And by not loosening up their bowels, and let the money flowing again, which in turn opens up the job market, the corporations are only hurting themselves - but not before they hurt everyone else."},

I guess I do the same to them. Just when they are about to write me off as a grizzled old ape completely alzheimered out, I amaze them.Case in point. One student aide examines a text message on his cell phone and asks to no one in particular, \"How much is a wizard of pot?\"I think a moment, actually think out loud, and say \"Ounce. Abbreviation O-Z. OZ. Wizard of OZ. An ounce\".\"...Did you just think of that?\"\"Yup\".\"That's pretty good\".\"I still have my moments\".Mother Nature does the same thing to us. That's what is so cool about life on earth. Just when you think everything is settled, someone finds something that makes you say \"wow\".Take the fossils they just found down in Gabon, in Western Africa, near the Congo. Here is a link to a  better picture of them. These are fossils of multicellular organisms that date back to 2.1 billion years ago. So what?Well, before this find, the oldest fossils of multicellular life - animal life - go back to perhaps six or seven hundred million years, to the pre Cambrian. It was assumed that multicellular life, or life that you could actually see with the unaided eyes, got its start around that time. Prior to that, it was all microbes, going all the way back to the origin of life.This is just astounding. No really. It changes a lot of assumptions. It was thought that all that was around for two billion years was scum. Bacterial mats. Not that they aren't complex in their own right. But still, they're just scum. It means we have a lot of rethinking to do about life. A cell, in and of itself, is a pretty amazing thing. I don't think our engineers have even come close to building a machine as complex as the innards of a cell. So then it is just that much more amazing when cells can communicate and cooperate together to form an organism. It's just a whole other added layer of complexity on top of that.And now they've found that all this stuff was going on two billion years before we thought it happened. Why, it poses lots of questions.Hopefully, the fossil site at Gabon will provide answers."},
{"title": "Tunguska!", "date": "Wednesday, June 30, 2010", "text": "Today, June 30th, is the 102nd anniversary of the Tunguska explosion in Siberia. Thought I forgot about it, didn't ya?It is generally agreed that the explosion, which devastated an area of about 30 square miles, was an airburst of a meteor or small asteroid or comet fragment. Estimates vary, but a general figure of 5 - 30 megatons would have caused the damage - a good-size H-bomb. No crater was found. Trees were knocked down over a radius of 10 miles. The blast was heard 600 miles a away (\"eight sharp reports as from a cannon\").Witnesses in the nearby town of Kirensk described the event variously as a \"pillar of fire\", \"a ball of fire, coming down obliquely\", \"a flying star with a fiery tail\". In other words, something fell out of the sky very, very fast.Various kooks, not happy with the prosaic explanation of a stone falling from the sky, attribute Tunguska to everything from a piece of antimatter to a mini black hole to Nicola Tesla's Death Ray. Suffice to say, I have neither the time nor inclination to explain why these alternate explanations are horseshit, although I will debunk Tesla.The story goes that Tesla was trying to devise a method of transferring electrical power through the air or earth. With financing from J.P. Morgan, he built an enormous Tesla tower on Long Island. In an experiment, he supposedly contacted Richard Peary to look for unusual events at the North Pole. On the evening of June 30th, he aimed his particle beam death ray at the North Pole, but overshot and hit Tunguska.Aside from the fact that this sounds like something I wrote in the fucking 4th grade, someone forgot about the International Dateline. June 30th in New York City is July 1st in Siberia. If you draw a great circle from NYC to the North Pole, it comes nowhere near the impact site. And if Tesla had managed to direct a particle beam, the emission strength would be such that Long Island, and most of Manhattan, would have been vaporized. I think someone would have noticed that. Not to mention, I think Santa would have pitched a major bitch about the whole seedy affair.Face it folks, Tesla was desitute, insane, and showing a distressing tendency of attempting to fuck pigeons at the sorry stage of life when he started talking about his death ray. And the US Government would be using it at every opportunity since 1937. Blah. Blah. Blah.But you know, plenty of fast moving boulders out there. Something to think about.Boo!"},

Otherwise, we'd be making a lot more ridiculous purchases and driving ourselves deeper and deeper into debt. Right? Hey, wait a minute...Some old department store magnate from the 19th century once said \"Half my advertising dollars are wasted.

Many may try to ignore these messages, but when you are constantly inundated, when you have no choice but to swim in this sea of stuff, it is hard not to pay attention to it - especially when you trying not to pay attention to it.Even if you manage this task, it is hard not to be influenced or affected by everyone around you who is paying attention to it. Thus, I hardly ever watch TV, yet I know, through interactions with my TV-watching fellow chimps, at least a cursory knowledge of TV land and its celebrity denizens.It's as if we swim in a sea of plasmids, those rings of DNA information that bacteria swap with each other, and just can't help but bump into them.Well, nothing new or insightful here, right? And yet one of the themes I choose to keep on hammering on is, despite our seeming complexity in form and function and behavior, we are still quite primitive creatures, illogical, ruled by animal passions, and predictably irrational. Fear. Anger. Comfort. Pain avoidance. Pleasure seeking. It's as if simple biological rules can describe us, our attributes, our boundaries, and all the little receptors that populate them.And, of course, all designed to move product, which is what life does. That's metabolism. Move it, convert it, transform it, and survive on the energy of transformation.And one of the most amazing, magical products, one that is protean, chymerical, modularly brandable, massively adaptable is that creature known as the political candidate..."},

You know those beer commericals where they feature these really obnoxious guys? Frat boy types? Not very smart? With all the eloquence and finesse of bull seals waddling on a beach? Not very attractive? In fact, below average in looks, with pudgy, doughy, unsightly bodies? And possessed of troglodyte moral standards.In short, don't you just want to punch their faces back into their brains?And aren't they always surrounded by hot chicks, or at least with cool toys or a superb abode that they are obviously too fucking dumb to have the means to afford?And these commercials have been in place for decades. And don't you think the advertising guys know this?Well, of course they do. They are bypassing your logic circuits and tapping right into your reptilian brain. \"Look at these assholes\" the advertisers say, \"They are obviously losers. Life has played a cruel joke upon them. Much worse off than you. And yet these fucking clowns are turning away super hot chicks that want to fuck them. And the difference between them and you is that they are using our product\".Years ago, I read a book called \"The Hidden Persuaders\" by Vance Packard. Packard recounts how advertisers teamed up wth behavioral psychologists, and tapped into the vast wealth of the subconscious. Packard wrote the book as a cautionary tale in 1957. The advertisers have become far more sophisticated, as now we have neurologists and brain scanning to tap into.And the advertisers have moved beyond the manufacturing world to package some of the easiest product that ever was concieved - politicians. I'll have more to say about this as time allows."},
{"title": "Habits of Empire", "date": "Thursday, June 24, 2010", "text": "The term 'assimilation' came to take on a diabolical coloration in 1989, with the introduction of Star Trek's the Borg, the race of cybernetic organisms who, like vampires, prey upon and occasionally convert others not like them.\"You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile\".Prior to this, assimilation, or rather forced assimilation, was given the connotation of a good thing. Something that, here in America, previously unincorporated groups were fortunate to experience. Kind of like being conquered by Rome, and becoming citizens of Rome.  Ah, but America is not Rome. Hell, Rome was not Rome. It was, like the Reagan era a revisionist saga of romantic hogwash, hiding a dingier, moldier, more stifling and depressing reality.But I don't want to talk about that. At least, not overly so. The metaphor as America as Borg, like America as Rome, has been used too often and too easily. There are some half-truths there, as is the case with all metaphoric comparisons. Any conservative worthy of calling him or herself that, who, if they truly cherish worthy traditions, has a duty to view our history (warts and all) truthfully and clearly. Conservatives would do well to read \"Habits of Empire\", by Notre Dame historian Walter Nugent. The expansion of America is empire in all but name and title.But again, that's not what I want to talk about. The fictional Borg, in case you do not know, have as their goal a quest for perfection. Perfection, in their case, seems to be a transformation beyond the limited abilities of the organic, or perhaps the material as well, into a transcendent state of some kind, never really specified. In the process, they wish to \"improve the quality of life, for all species\". They apparently mean well, provided your vision of well-being corresponds with theirs. In that sense, the Borg are like Neoconservatives, the latest personification of American Stalinism (exporting the revolution), or Manifest Destiny. They have impressive technologies. They have a collective, a distributed intelligence, a massively parallel hive mind that, presumably, bespeaks of extremely high intelligence. (It requires that you assume that higher intelligence is simply more stuff, like a Chinese Wave, just throw more brains in the mix and things get solved).  They are homogeneous and anonymous, any individual is representative of all, and as such it is an egalitarianism not unlike slavery. Equality is forced upon them. Conservatives would emphasize this point, calling it Statism. (Conservatives who use this term obviously do not understand participatory democracy, amongst other things and have bought into the Libertarian Fallacy, and all the infantilism that entails). But the point is lost and irrelevant, because here is individuality, flawed, error-prone, limited in reach and scope, replaced with a Thinking State with One Mind, possessed of the wisdom of crowds, flexible, error-correcting. There is no dictatorship of the State because, quite simply, there are no longer any subjects to dictate to. Quite an alien concept). The problem with this fictional vision, and the utopian goal, is that the Borg never really seem to DO anything. Oh, they, as the ultimate users, go around and consume civilizations,  accumulate and incorporate new knowledge from their \"victims\", increase in size and power. But they don't seem to progress. They, not unlike a slime mold, or a culture of bacteria, or a viral infection, consume, metabolize, and reproduce, but that's about all they do. Despite centuries, or hundreds of centuries, of history, despite possessing a supergenius of a hive mind, they don't seem to do much more than that. Granted, they are a fictional bogeyman, and any underlying philosophy has been developed by TV scriptwriters, but still...So, is this not a proper analogy for the USA, or for Western Civilization, or for that matter, our species, or just Life in general? Is that it? Are we just consumers and breeders? Should we be looking for a loftier goal? Or is merely converting more and more of the universe into stuff that lives and thinks good enough?  Or is the mere act of introspection about these things good enough? I honestly don't know..."},
{"title": "Summer Art", "date": "Wednesday, June 23, 2010", "text": "I'm finally working on some new art. Here's a piece I call \"Open Source\". It is cast glass and wood, about 9\" x 12\" x 3\". I decided to light up this one. My normal inclination is to never light up glass. Seems too obvious a thing to do. But for this one, I felt it wasn't overly gauche to try it.  This piece came together exactly as I wanted visionwise, and almost processwise. Most of the time visionwise there is at least one thing I forgot/fucked up, or a funny little number that our perverse universe threw in the mix that I had to compensate for. All the time processwise. I stuck my hand in wet plaster just starting to set, held it until it set, and got exactly the right combination of fidelity/rough texture first time out. I could not have asked for a better mold. The waxes formed off of this mold could not have been more cooperative.  Aside from some compatability problems with the glass, the colors and textures are pretty much as I wanted them. And I like the look and presentation of the piece as well. I'll had to drill and cut and hole in a wall and hardwire the electrical connections and patch the wall back up, but that was fun. All in all an enjoyable and satisfactory experience. Really not much more to say about this piece. I will say that the past two semesters have been irritating, as I've not had time to work on my own art. During the times when I should have worked, I had neither the energy nor the inclination to work. I suspect that I will regret not using the time in the future when I have precious little time left. On the other hand, I also suspect that any art I would have made would have suffered in quality. And then, during the times when I wanted to work, there have been far too many students who either needed the studio space or my assistance. How dare they get their money's worth!"},
{"title": "The Whitest Show On Earth", "date": "Tuesday, June 22, 2010", "text": "I'm not in it, but I've made a cameo. My ancestors on both sides of the family come from near Ground Zero of the Blonde Map of Europe. Don't ask me why I tan so well.I guess I better warn you right now that I'm going to use the \"n\" word later in a joke. I'm also going use the \"j\" word as well. If I remember to, I might even use the \"r \" word too. Hopefully, it will be a not too harmful usage, as it is meant to be a joke, but I'm sure some will be offended regardless. This is a preemptive apology, but we'll see how it turns out.Anyways, I recently read an article on the US census about how, at least in America, the category of \"white\" is fairly flexible and amorphous, and increasingly inclusive over time. I'm sure a fictional and revisionist account would go something like \"Well, at one time only the Anglo-Saxons were considered white, but then as more and more people immigrated from Europe and insinuated themselves into our society, the category was stretched to include Germans, French, Irish, Poles, Spaniards, Italians (I guess), etc.\" In other words, it looks like we have to include the non-blonde-haired, non-blue-eyed, light-to-swarthy complected people into the club.I doubt this occurred in Europe, where pretty much everyone is white, but I suppose if you view white as a class, you might get away with this type of account here in America. My own thoughts on the matter? There is the Nation of Islam account about how 6,600 years ago, a mad scientist named Yakub, of the tribe of Shabazz, created the white devil race by sequestering 59,999 black people on the island of Patmos, and slowly breeding the black elements out of them. Interestingly, the mutations for light complected eyes and hair are about that old, dating to around 7,000 year ago. I suppose before then, there were no white people. Do I believe that (the Nation of Islam account)? No. I just note the coincidence - with no small amount of irony. In any case, it is interesting how such an unscientific term as whiteness can be treated as so real. Well, social constructs are like that. There might be a pseudo-scientific rational behind it, through the use of genetics. I mentioned in a prior entry, how once I participated in the Genographic Project. Turns out my family belongs to haplogroup I1, typically considered the Northern Barbarians.  If you want to talk  about belonging to a fake category of whites, I don't see how you really can get any whiter. If I ever wished to form some dipshit white supremacist club, I could say to pretty much every dipshit white supremacist who wanted to join \"Nope, sorry. Not white enough for me\".Anyways, there was some speculation in our family as to whether we were Jewish. It turns out that the name Kurman is, according to all of our Jewish friends, \"Jewish as hell\". Well, yes, if you happen to be a Kurman from southern Germany, Switzerland, or Austria, then chances are very good you are Jewish.But we are from the Mecklenberg region of Germany. Up on the Baltic Sea coast north of Berlin, right next to Denmark and Poland. There are Kurmans in Denmark, and in the West Pommeranian district of Poland. In fact, Kurman can be an Iranian name, or a Turkic name, or a Mongolian name. I very much doubt there is a family connection there. So, here comes the science to set up the joke. There is, as far as I am concerned, absolutely no doubt that every single one of us humans can trace our ancestry back to Africa, some 60,000 years ago. And there is good evidence that the majority of Ashkenazi Jews have Y-chromosome (male ancestry) that traces back to the Middle East pretty rapidly (3,000 years give or take). One of the genographic tests I took was the Y-chromosome test (male lineage) which showed we were in Northern Europe for the past 20,000 years.When I got the results back, I told the family: \"I got good news and bad news\". \"What's the good news?\"\"We're not Jews.\"\"What's the bad news?\"\"We're niggers.\"Well, it's not exactly a thigh slapper, but it is intended to recognize, in a weird and twisted way, my solidarity with the rest of humanity, a shared origin, regardless of false distinctions. Take it as you will, my cousins."},

I was engaged in my cool-down walk on my way home after a run at the end of what was just a fucking spectacular weather day here in the Midwest, and one of the biggest ravens I've ever seen was up on a telephone wire checking me out. As I walked under him (or her, but let's call him a him), I would glance up to see what was happening.\"Please, don't poop on me\" I said to him. It wouldn't have mattered as I'm pretty sure he doesn't understand human talk, and I was going to shower anyway. Still, no one likes to get pooped on. And I had his full attention. He was bent down, that livid dark eyeball focused on me like a, well, not like a laser, but really focused on me. He was paying special attention.I know a lot people are very uneasy around crows. Some can't quite explain it, but I have the answer. They are really smart, and people know it, consciously or no. They are smarter than a lot of people I know, or see on TV. And I can prove it. I very much doubt the people I see on TV could survive on road kill and other sundries. And the people on TV couldn't hide things, or lie, or figure out puzzles as well as some crows or ravens I've known.It's not like I've known a lot of them, or even made their acquaintance. But I see shit, observe things, get lucky, been around at the right time and place. They are smart fuckers.I like 'em.Reading as I do, as often as I can, about corvids, I came across the fact that they can recognize individual human faces. That's quite an accomplishment. And the question is why? Why do they need to have this capacity? What happened back there in the dim mists of time that our paths crossed so often that this talent was selected for? Because we are predators? We leave behind kill? And certain human predators were more skilled or lucky at killing? And it paid off, evolution-wise, for a crow that could recognize a gifted hunter, versus a crow who just saw us as those shambling apes that sometimes leave behind tasty and nutritious treats, but you know, they all look the same to me?

He said they'd be recovering 90% of oil soon!\"Well, yes, assuming nothing goes wrong.I am a firm believer in Murphy's Law: \"Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong\". Actually, the term \"belief\" is a pale and shallow descriptor of  my conviction in this statement. This goes beyond fact, beyond faith. This is a universal physical principle.And so, in light of reading through what may be the worst possible scenario, that the well casing is well-and-truly fucked, that oil and sand mixture is rapidly eroding the parts down there like a high pressure sandblaster, that the wellhead and blowout preventer could very well pop right off and the whole monstrous flow turn into a literal volcano of oil, I think we all need to steel ourselves for this eventuality. It could very well be that the entire oil reservoir, between 2 to 4 billion barrels of oil at minimum, could devastate the Gulf. It would be an American Chernobyl, times ten.

I am ending the Friday Happy Happy Harmless Everything is OK theme. I am doing so because it is:Cramping my stylenot making me happy. I'm happiest when I'm sour.threatening to make me lazy. I could just embed videos of kittens or puppies or chuckling babies.kind of an artificial tradition in a journal which really hasn't been around long enough to merit one, and thus:when these entries finally Jump the Shark, I'll introduce a cutesie theme again.Anyways...Today is the date that the Japanese space probe Hayabusa and its sample return capsule is scheduled to make it back to Earth. The spacecraft and capsule travelled to, and touched down upon, the near-Earth asteroid Itokawa five years ago. After travelling a total of 1.25 billion miles, it is returning to Earth with a piece of that asteroid.Unfortunately for us, and in a variant of Crichton's \"Andromeda Strain\", or Vonnegut's Ice-Nine, it turns out that Itokawa is composed of the death crystal. Yes, folks, the death crystal, your average everyday run-of-the-mill, death crystal, as opposed to the Death Crystal, which is, obviously completely fictional as it is capitalized.So, naturally, the spacecraft and return capsule have had their material rearranged and crystallized into a seed of death crystal. And it will impact South Australia today and then the death crystallization of all matter on the planet will commence.When it reaches your area, the transformation should be easy to spot. There will be a noise like plastic being crumpled, kind of a squeaking and cracking sound, as forms are converted and frozen into place. And things will get a little hot, because freezing things into place that were formerly in motion releases heat. And all that matter that is rearranged retains its form, but has a kind of sickly, grisly, translucent, purplish-grey cast to it. You should clearly see, feel, and hear the wave approaching.Here's what I advise. The death crystal transformation wave only affects matter that is above a certain density and is in close contact with. If you time it right, all you have to do is hop in the air when the death crystal wave reaches you. The wave will pass beneath you and you will not be transformed.Problem is, there won't be anything to eat and drink after the wave passes, so you basically grant yourself a slower version of death.Okay, so maybe hopping isn't the thing to do.Good luck!"},

It may be the endorphins. (In fact, after making some truly hideous judgement calls after running, I've given up on any decision making then. The endorphins make the absolute worst decisions look good). I think it may be that the run shuts the talkie-talk part of the brain off for awhile. When all you can think about is drawing the next breath, you don't have much to talk about.My mother had cataract surgery this past week. The surgeon put an intraocular lens in her bad eye. She is amazed at how well she can see, and can't wait to get the other eye done. This after me and the family hectoring and berating her to get the surgery done.At one point, she mentioned to me how she could see a traffic sign \"Right...about...now\", which, by that point, we were past it (I was driving). \"For fuck's sake, Mom!\" (yes, I said that, because I was mad), \"Get the cataract surgery!\".At another point, she asked me to look at a picture attachment on her email. She had received pics of her grandson at an elementary school function up in Wisconsin. My nephew is seated on a tractor. \"Look at that!\" she asked me. \"Is that Josh's penis showing?\" \"...that's a fold in his pants\", I replied \"But if it was his penis, the boy is being taken care of. Jesus H Christ, get the cataract surgery, will ya, please?\"We got a new gas kiln at the college. It's a Geil kiln, with venturi gas jets, so it is super quiet. We fired it the first time to cure the bricks and mortar and drive the moisture out. I walked into the room and said \"Smells like pool shock in here. Kind of like chlorine\". The ceramics professor couldn't smell anything. I pulled out the fiberfrax plug stuffed into the stinghole (the peep hole) and let him sniff it. \"Wow, you got a good nose!\". Actually I do. Even when I was smoking, I had a good sense of smell. Now, since I quit, I'm smelling stuff that, well, I'd rather not smell.Speaking of which, I succumbed to temptation at a party last weekend. Heavy drinking will do that. Make you want a smoke, that is. Rather than bum a smoke, I snagged a drag off someone. They were smoking those American Spirit cigarettes. The taste was delicious. But the buzz (from one short drag), was awful. I was dizzy and nauseous, and regretted it. I think I'm done smoking.I'm gearing up to see a movie. I only go to movies if they merit a big screen experience. I haven't found one yet, but feel the need to just get the hell out of the house. These working seven days a week schedules with twelve hour weekdays are starting to be a drag - after only ten years! But coming home at 9pm and slumping down in front of the TVis getting old for some reason.However, I am reading. I won't bother to put down a reading list, as I go through 2-3 books every two weeks. Right now, at this exact moment? I'm reading \"Crow Planet\" by Lyanda Haupt\", \"Deliver Us from Evil, The Slavery Question in the Old South\" by Lacy K. Ford. I'm reading the crow book because I really like crows and ravens. And they seem to like me. Remind me to tell you my animal stories sometime. I'm reading the slavery book because I ran into a complete and total butthead (a Teabagger, naturally) from Georgia who insists that the Civil War was about State's Rights, not slavery.On a different note, since he thinks government is the enemy, but for some reason wants us to kick the rest of the world's asses with our military, I asked him how he manages to keep that cognitive dissonance partitioned. I mean, if government sucks, and the military is part of the government, how does the military not suck? Why don't private companies take care of all that?And how can you have limited government with a military that has a budget equal to the rest of the world's combined? The boy can't seem to reason it out.But honestly, I'm really starting to get worried about conservatives. I think they've just completely given up on thinking. If they go any further to the right, they might as well start learning German - 1930s German.Conservatives look like their letting those frontal lobes rot into cheese from lack of use, and emote with their scared little animal brains. You know, thinking with their gut. And when you think with your gut, all you manage to do is stain your undies when you voice a liquid brown opinion.Alright, enough.

{"title": "Outer Space", "date": "Friday, June 4, 2010", "text": "Back when I had a real job, I was working briefly at a bloated plutocratic  international corporation, doing work on Inventory. I knew the company had a satellite in geosynchronous orbit, so I looked it up. The computerized inventory system required that the location of all the physical assets be listed. In other words, the system required that the satellite have an address. Some data processing clerk, to get around this requirement, listed the satellite's address as \"Outer Space\".A couple of years ago, I was watching the local nightly news. Mars had just passed through its closest approach to Earth, in something like a once in seven thousand years event. The meteorologist was slotted to deliver this bit of news about Mars. The producer picked him, I suppose, because Mars is up in the sky, where the weather is.So, once he'd done his bit, there was an awkward pause. (Let's face it, news people are not exactly deep thinkers. So I suppose everyone's brain was churning trying to think of something to say without seeming a completely ignorant buffoon). Finally, the anchorman (Ron Magers) quipped \"Well, at least there was no invasion\".Ron Magers is a funny guy.I laughed, but then I was given to pause. I had a little thrill of fear. It was a good thrill of fear. I think I was hit with the impression of all that dark deep space out there. Outer Space. You know, we really don't know what's out there. When I was a kid, the planets were all just points of light. Or maybe a fudgey smudge of a circle. Mars just might have life on it. And Venus was thought to possibly be a swamp planet, with maybe dinosaurs and blonde Amazons living on it. This was a time when a Three Stooges in Orbit movie held equal scientific weight with actual scientific knowledge.Times have changed. Those points of light have, through our intrepid robotic probes, become whole worlds. Vast worlds. And there have been people on one of them. I remember that. I remember a nice summer evening, looking up at the Moon, and saying \"There's people up there!\"So, maybe we've become a bit jaded. We have pictures of these places, and think we know all about them (\"we\" being the public, scientists can never get enough information). It's kind of like seeing pictures of all the major sites in Paris, and thinking we know all about Paris.But we don't. It's a big scary place out there, even just in our own Solar System.But I think it's a good scary."},
{"title": "Fermi's Paradox", "date": "Thursday, June 3, 2010", "text": "Back in the 50s, during the flying saucer craze, a bunch of nuclear physicists were sitting around the lunch table at Los Alamos, discussing current events.Curious and speculative creatures that they are, they wondered whether intelligent life existed out there in the universe? Naturally, the pens and pencils came out, napkins and table clothes were scribbled upon, guesses were posed, assumptions and suppositions quantified, equations formulated, numbers calculated, and the answer turned out to be \"Yes\".Not only was the answer yes, there are aliens out there, but yes, there should be a LOT of aliens out there, and they should have visited us by now. And so one physicist, by the name of Enrico Fermi, aksed the question \"Where are they?\"That's Fermi's paradox. Given the age of the universe, the appropriate number of stars and planets that could harbor Life (and not necessarilly our kind of Life), the (supposedly) inevitable evolution of intelligence, and from that a development of technology, then aliens should be all over the fricking place. But they are not. Where are they?Hundreds of explanation have been offered. Ranging from:We Earthlings are too primitive/violent/creepy/icky for contactWe Earthlings are the first race so farThe aliens are really, really, really far awayThey are here, in disguiseetcNone of these explanations are completely satisfactory for one reason or another. Let's ignore the fact that the whole issue is question begging anyway. We have only one example (if you are liberal and tolerant enough to grant humanity this) of intelligent life. There's no reason that aliens have to be like us. None whatsoever. But I've figured out the answer. Ready? Shh. Come close and I'll whisper it to you.Time travel.Yeah, that's why they ain't around. Paradox solved. Once you have time travel, you are God. You can do anything you want, go anywhere you want, know anything and everything, change anything and everything. Whoever invents time travel first, gets to be God. So, sometime in the future, people can travel in time. And all those aliens? We got rid of them all.Or, more probably, they got rid of us."},
{"title": "Cock's Spur on Rye", "date": "Wednesday, June 2, 2010", "text": "What you are looking at is an ear of rye grass,  and the creepy looking rotten banana thing on it is an ergot. The French think it looks like a rooster's spur, and so the title Cock's Spur on Rye. The ergot is a fungal parasite, and replaces a grain of rye. The fungus is called Calviceps purpurea. Until the 1850s, it was assumed that the ergot parasite was part of the rye plant.Ingestion of ergot causes a condition known as ergotism. In Medieval, and probably ancient times, it was known as the Holy Fire, or St. Anthony's Fire, due to the symptoms of convulsions and painful burning in the extremities. The symptoms were caused by a variety of mycotoxins - toxic alkaloids that the fungus produced. Along with the pain, the toxins produced ghastly hallucinations in practically any animal that ingested it. There are two kinds of poisoning: gangrenous ergotism, in which blood is cut off to the extremities due to constriction of the arteries and capillaries.Convulsive ergotism is characterized by  nervous dysfunction, where the victim is twisting and contorting, trembling, shaking,  and experiences wryneck, a more of less fixed twisting of the neck, which seem ot further stimulate convulsions and fits. Modern pharmaceuticals have been derived from these poisons, including one much abused substance derived from the compound of ergotamine - LSD.But that's not what I want to talk about. The really creepy thing about this fungus is its lifestyle - how it propagates. I mentioned that it is a parasite, and parasitism in Nature is so pervasive that - if you happen to believe in Intelligent Design - you'd be hard-pressed not to be convinced that the Almighty loves parasites.The ergot is the nonsexual over-wintering form of the fungus. In the spring, it sprouts stroma, the sexual forms, like little mushrooms, that release the spores. The spores have evolved over time to exactly imitate the pollen of the rye flowers. Once a spore settles down on a rye flower, it destroys and replaces the ovum of the flower, and sends out insidious tendrils into the plant that take over the feeding tubes that would nourish the seeds. Once established, it can also produce a secondary infestation of the ear of rye, by producing honeydew, a sticky, sweet amber liquid that contains asexual clone spores. The honeydew is picked up by insects, which spreads the parasite further.All in all, just some really, truly, deeply creepy behavior.Why bring this up? The New York Times recently had an article about the Singularity, found here. They've presented a rather optimistic view of what all will happen, once the Singularity begins, the human age ends, and all bets are off. I've mentioned in a prior essay that I'm sure we can predict what these superhuman machines, or machine/human hybrids, or who-knows-what will do, because they will now be alive, and likely to repeat all or most of the behaviors of living things.Well, there you go. This is one behavior. I can find a lot more examples. But I guess you could say I'm lately leaning towards a dystopian view.Tra-la-la!"},

That's something noticeable. That's something not minimal. We won't have that word bandied about\".So, while BP is handling language control, they are now on Plan R.And in a sure sign of desperation, they've asked for advice from the public. The public, mind you, who elect representatives to Congress. The public that voted for Rand Paul. That reads People Magazine. The public that watches TV.Yeah, that public.So naturally, the time has come to talk about that most American of problem fixers -nuking things.\"Let's nuke it\" say some. Actually, it was more like \"YE-AHH! YEE-AHHH! NUKE IT! NUKE IT!! NUKE IT!!!!\" Or something like that.Because, honestly, if you think rationally and calmly about it for a moment, that's really about all the Federal Government could do. They surely don't have the expertise that the oil industry does.

(Oh, please at least try to be consistent, you enormous fuckheads. Or better still, shut the fuck up).But back to nuking things. Oh, I suppose we could. It really comes down to the lesser of two evils. Six months of oil washing up on beaches (yes, come on now, get real, six more months minimum), or an irradiated oil field and sea floor that BP can't pump oil out of. Or possibly set off a chain reaction of methane hydrate ices buried under the sea mud that bubble up from the world's sea floors and then (because it is the most powerful greenhouse gas) raise global temperatures in a matter of weeks to, well, a AlGorean proportion. (And have you noticed the boy is getting plump?)I mean, the Russians would do it. Probably have. But they have nothing to lose.Swell. Tell you what.

{"title": "Stupid Ideas", "date": "Wednesday, May 26, 2010", "text": "I actually had an idea that was not stupid, once. Naturally, others thought of it as well. I'll get to that.I've had a number of stupid ideas, but can only remember only a few. Perhaps shame and embarassment have something to do with memory retention.The first I can recall was rawhide frisbies for dogs. You know how your dog chews up your frisbee, and after some time it is no fun throwing it? Because the dog has torn up the plastic and little thorny protrusions of plastic from the teeth marks cut your skin when you throw it? So, I figured. Fine. I got my frisbee. Dog has his. Go ahead chew the shit out of that fucker. Of course, he still wants to chase and catch your frisbee. And his frisbee is all chewed up and yuck. And so...Green lights on the back of cars. You got red lights to signal when your breaking braking (jeez, I cannot spel todya). Why not green lights to signal when you are stepping on the gas? Uh, why? I don't know. Maybe to give people a scintilla of hope in a traffic jam? Maybe alleviate the monotony of a sea of red lights? Moving on...The warm water tap. Next...This one I got while watching the opening of the Las Vegas Star Trek Experience on TV. Amidst the celebrity shots and celebration was a long angle shot of the hotel and, well, lookee, there, hookers. Or high class prostitutes. Or probably just Orange County babes in Vegas. But then I thought. Hey! Makeup artists and latex makeup and we create alien hookers for the Star Trek geeks. You know, Vulcan hookers, Klingon hookers.I mean, who doesn't want to do a Klingon hooker?I might have to join the team get set up as a Klingon Pimp Daddy. I wonder how Klingon Pimp Daddies dress up? I can see the leapord or zebra skin fur coat, the cane, the big hat, maybe. But a feather in the big hat, or high heeled shoes with goldfish in them? I can't see a Klingon Pimp Daddy in that.Anyway, anyone notice a common theme here so far? Perhaps the sweet blue musty musky earthy odor of cannabis?Well, duh! Not lately, though. Least ways, not so you could notice...Which brings me to my idea. A little background. In fourth grade, I had a bout with some kind of viral crud which put me down for a week. I recovered, except that I had damage to the nerves in my ears. I lost a lot of the high end of hearing, which is kind of crucial in conversations. Old age and rock'n'roll abuse and power tools have not helped. So I am well on my way to becoming stone deef.So, once DVDs came out and the machines had subtitle options. I was so on that. And then one day, I'm coming out of the theater, and it was an English comedy (\"Snatch\", if you must know), and I was a little disappointed that I didn't catch all of the dialogue that everyone else was laughing at. \"It's too bad they don't have subtitles, or at least like heads-up display closed caption glasses that I could wear to see the subtitles without the other folks having to see them\".(!!!!)Of course, subtitle glasses. Fuck those 3-D glasses. I'm color blind anyway so they don't work.Of course, a quick googling brought me down to Earth. Someone else had thought of it, and they were in development. Actually, they should be available now.So where the hell are they?(Oh, and if anyone makes monies off of the Klingon Pimp Daddy, I want my cut)."},

{"title": "The 'Lost' Finale", "date": "Sunday, May 23, 2010", "text": "I'm sorry folks, but I just can't give a shit.If it weren't for the fact that I just happened to catch a snippet of news this morning, I'd never have known that ABC TV's show 'Lost' was having their series finale tonight. It doesn't help that time restrictions have kept me from watching much of prime time TV for the past five years. That and the fact that I don't have cable leaves me out of a lot of conversations. Is that bad? It's not like I'm a TV snob. Hell, I love TV. If I could, I'd be a fat, old slob on a couch. But I've got obligations to fulfill, bills to pay, a life to live. (No offense, couch potatoes).I've had chances to watch TV shows. From the few viewing opportunities I've had, some shows look interesting. Other shows just do not engage me. 'Lost' is one of them.I had a chance to watch a season synopsis, where the show summarizes everything up to now. I sat through the whole thing. At the end, I said, \"Well, looks like I don't need to watch this for another year\".Now, I'm introspective enough to wonder what the buzz is about. Why are so many people fascinated with this show? Is it me? Am I suffering from Hollywood/TV imposed and inflicted ADHD? Is it possible I need everything explained and resolved?No, its not that. I may not be a dramatist or TV critic, but I do recognize the need for suspense in a mystery. The question is, like in music or sex, how long do you prolong the tease before the resolution? Take it too far and it gets irritating. Leave too many things unresolved and I lose interest. Not because it is too complicated. But because it is too contrived.It's a false mystery.Questions are set up that do nothing to drive the narrative forward. Just as there are some action movies that make use of maddeningly jittery and quick cut edit shots to create a sense of velocity to the action (as opposed to, oh, I don't know, writing a good story) and create what I call false action, so you can have false mystery.Not to mention I'm unable to empathise with the characters. They are all just too stupid. Like in frustration comedy, they have to choose the least straightforward course of action - not because they are flawed human beings, but because the law of melodrama - suspense for suspense's sake - requires it.And then there's the whole \"Save the World\" theme. \"The fate of the world depends upon what you do next\". In today's TV and movie land, I think that's the corpse of a horse that's been pummeled into a thin veneer. Don't you think that's just a little infantile? Just a touch self-serving in an emotionally immature manner?Am I a snob? I don't think so. Contrarian? Sure, why not.Well, anyway. You 'Lost' fans. Enjoy your show.(Oh, and uh, the 'Matrix' movies all sucked a big, red rubber cock. And I can give you ten solid reasons why)."},
{"title": "Star Trek Ruined Star Trek", "date": "Friday, May 21, 2010", "text": "Kind of a violation of my own rules that there is no mindless happy, happy fluff today, but rather a half-ass attempt at pseudo-scholarly criticism of Star Trek. In a geek way, of course.Over the course of the whole Star Trek franchise, with the various shows and movies, a common fan complaint is that \"_____ ruined Star Trek\" ( ____ being JJ Abrams, or Rick Berman, or UPN, or a series like Enterprise, which spoiled the canon). And what they mean by ruined is \"not staying true to the origianl vision\".Uh, excuse me? It's not a real adventure. It was a dramatic series. In fact, when Gene Roddenberry pitched the series to NBC, he repeatedly called in \"Horatio Hornblower in Space\". One would do well to read C.S. Forester's novels to see what Roddenberry was talking about.Obviously Captain Kirk is based upon the Hornblower character. But there is more to it than that.Picture a time in the age of sail. It could take years to navigate around the world. Ports of call were truly alien and exotic. Because of the distances involved and the speed of ships, weeks or months could go by between meetings with ships of the mother country, let alone communications and orders from the home fleet. A captain, in this case an English captain, represented his country in a way not known in present day. His ship literally was England, and a captain had an amount of leeway - and responsibility - in action and judgement without precedent in scope and power.So, you have all sorts of dramatic attractions. Romance, adventure, the seduction and fear of the unknown, and, above all, a lot of opportunity for error in judgement. Things can go Wrong, which is what drama (and comedy) is all about. Naturally, modifications are made for setting. The ship can't really take weeks or months or years to get from one place to another, or for news to arrive from home. The times and distances have to be just right - both for the tastes of the audience and the boundaries of the show. The time it takes for news and orders to reach the Enterprise from Starfleet Command must be long enough so that Kirk has to, at times, take initiative and think on his feet, rather than merely following orders. (With the potential that he may make the wrong decision or one contrary to Command decisions). On the other hand, it must be short enough so that he will occasionally be ordered into an uncomfortable situation, or for him to potentially get in trouble when he fails to obey orders. This creates dramatic tension.Which brings us back to error. This is the purpose of the triad - Kirk, Bones, and Spock. To visually, dramatically, play out the internal dialogues we all go through when making a decision. Spock, obviously representing the dispassionate and cerebral characteristic. Bones, the gut instinct, the emotional side. The two getting into arguments, yes, even getting snappy and snarky. Presenting Cat Fights, if you will. Kirk, vacillating between the two, questioning himself, but ultimately making the hard choice. And, at the beginning at least, making the wrong choice.Human error. Foibles, flaws, judgement calls, prejudice, ignorance. And then adapting, improvising, overcoming. That's what we want to see. But here's the problem. Part of Roddenberry's vision (in retrospect naive, overly optimistic, and ultimately self-defeating from a dramatic standpoint), is that as civilizations and people grow, they improve. They get nicer, and wiser, and well behaved. Which means they get boring.Cant' expect any action from the likes of them, and so we must introduce them to situations where interesting characters (read not quite as advanced - Special Guest Villians) put our protagonists into peril. In other words, drama becomes melodrama. The Perils of Pauline.Contrived situations, which is, uh oh! a sure sign that a series, or a franchise, has jumped the shark.But in Star Trek's case, not because they've run out of material (fer jeebus's sake there's a whole frickin galaxy of adventures out there!), but because of self-imposed limitations. \"Nice people don't do things like that!\"My take on it, at least."},
{"title": "You get three wishes", "date": "Thursday, May 20, 2010", "text": "Now that the genome is out of the bottle, you'd better make 'em good wishes.The latest from those crazy kid scientists.

The cell itself is real. Ill-informed or ignorant news reports will suggest otherwise, connoting a Frankensteinian cast to the whole project. And no doubt the Stupids Fox News or similar will get their little panties in a wad over this. Not to worry, and here's why.Up to now, genetic manipulation of DNA has been piecemeal and rather haphazard. This particular achievement finally allows us to make genetic changes in an orderly and systematic way. Far better and safer than what has occurred up to now - both in the lab and, more importantly, what occurs naturally out there in Nature.No, really. Nature has a much larger and more thriving business in genetic spit swapping than humans could ever hope to accomplish, and with no protective laboratories or lab protocols in place just in case something goes wrong. Case in point: All of those \"frankenfoods\" that people worry about? All of those genetically modified crops? Changed naturally through existing bacteria that naturally pass genes from one species to another. We just noticed they did it, and took advantage of it. What happens to mutated creatures let loose in Nature? They get slaughtered. Nature has had four billion years of red-in-tooth-and-claw evolution  under her belt. There's not much she hasn't already tried and discarded that poor little monkey boys have thought of.What about the grey goo scenario? How come some microbes don't find an advantageous mutation that allows them to take over everything? Answer again, four billion years of evolution. There are very few chemical reactions known to Man that haven't already been tried.So, I'm not worried. I actually think that this the end of dicking around.

{"title": "You're Not Crazy!", "date": "Wednesday, May 19, 2010", "text": "Well, maybe you are. A recent science article suggests that there is very little difference in brain chemistry between schizophrenics and healthy creative people. Specifically, the dopamine D2 receptors in healthy creative people have been found to be similar to those in schizophrenics.Highly creative skills have been shown to be somewhat more common in people who have mental illness in the family. This does not suggest that because your crazy uncle (or aunt) is crazy, you will be an amazing talent.However, there does seem to be a connection. It could be because the D2 receptors are less dense in an area called the thalamus, which directs a lot of traffic in the brain. By having less receptors, the thalamus is more prone to allow many more random connections to form, in a lateral or tangential sense, rather than a linear or logical sense. These uncommon connections may be useful in problem-solving situations, or, as in too much of a good thing, result in the bizarre associations of the mentally ill.\"Thinking outside the box might be facilitated by having a less intact box\".You know, I've always felt that phrase \"think outside the box\" was created by a plodding ponderous unimaginative person who was stuck on a problem and was pleading for help.And, yes, I am crazy."},

Yes, and I'm also very worried that you can hear spaceships cruise through vacuum like in Star Wars and Star Trek. Or how lasers make a noise like \"voosh!\", or \"peeee-yoo!\" And other important topics that movies get wrong for the sake of dramatic action.For some reason, I can't help but envision every single one of these bloggers as looking and sounding like Comic Book Guy from the Simpson's. (\"Worst blog ever! Rest assured I was on the Internet within seconds to register my complaint!\")Actually, I'd like to talk about some real science, which quite possibly might be exciting! So, here's a news article which got my brain a jingling. Quantum Darwinism.Sounds weird don't it? What the heck does particle physics and evolution have in common? Well, here's what.Poor old quantum mechanics. That word \"quantum\" has just been abused and mangled by every con artist and charlatan from Madame Blavatsky through Deepak Choprah. And the sad thing is, the interpretation that mind somehow effects mater through quantum interaction is not only so 20s (as in 1920s), but based upon a complete misunderstanding through the unfortunate use of the words \"observer\" and \"measurement\". As in \"observer effect\", or \"experimental measurement\". As if physicists are changing the world by measuring things. (They are not. Sorry folks, but experiments have been performed that prove that an objective reality exists out there that is independent of you. So sorry). And some interpreted this to mean that consciousness somehow is involved in physics, that the mind is choosing the reality. But, if you really think that you can change the universe with your mind, or that positive thoughts can change reality through quantum this or quantum that, try this very simple experiment.I want you to not pee for a week. That's all you have to do. If you can control your bladder for a whole week, you are on to something. Otherwise... oh, what's that you say? Deepak Choprah says that is a ridiculous request because it requires Advanced Mind Powers? Okay, have Deepak Choprah, or whatever guru or superior mentality you choose to mention, not pee for a week.But that's actually a good question, though. If the universe is fundamentally quantum, in other words, subject to sensitive changes, to odd fluctuations, to weird superpositions, where objects can be particles or waves, where you can pin down the position or the speed of something, but not both, then why isn't the world as we see it more unpredictable? In a state of flux? Why does it look so orderly and classical? (Well, actually you can see things quantum! Look at a shadow sometime. See how the edge of the shadow is not crisp and clear, but kind of fuzzy? That's light acting all goofy and quantum and refusing to be pinned down).I mean, different people should be seeing different things, right? As we all learned in Quantum Mechanics 101, directly finding out something about a quantum system (read \"everything\" for \"quantum system\") involves taking a measurement (read \"looking at\") that inevitably disturbs that system. This is all basic elementary stuff, right? So how come, if we go to Disneyworld, we both see Cinderella's castle as the same? How come you don't see twelve spires and I see thirteen? How come you don't see blood seeping from every surface and the reanimated corpse of that notorious anti-Semite Walt Disney hovering above with glowing red eyes scanning and scouting the park for unwanted Jews? Oh, you didn't take the shrooms? Never mind... but why isn't reality like being on shrooms? Why is it we all see the same thing?Well, a physicist at Los Alamos, Wojciech Zurek, has an answer to this. And I, for one, think he is on the right track. Quantum Darwinism. Reality, having just settled into a certain state (a particular regime of energy or configuration) , has a tendency to reinforce that state. It may be that that state, whatever it was that was \"selected\" may in some way be a lowest energy, or resting state. (Not necessarily). But once it is in that state, all the other fuzzy, weird, possible quantum states \"collapse\" to that selected state.So, there's a parsimony going on in reality, just as we see in evolution. And there's no need for all the messiness - the inevitable Solipsism - that comes from trying to throw mentation into the mix. Cool by me. I'd just make a mess of things anyway, if I had to recreate the world second by second."},
{"title": "End of the Semester Bitch", "date": "Tuesday, May 11, 2010", "text": "It happens every Spring. I will be SO... HAPPY... when I no longer have to deal with people for just a little while. This feeling of having to put up with people I have grown to - well, not hate, hate requires effort, but grown to feel increasingly irritated with, from overexposure, rarely occurs during the end of the fall semester. I think primarily because Winter Break is merely a respite, I will have to pretend to be nice for another four months. I am slowly accumulating straws upon my back. Little straws, but they add up. Little straw: one professor's passive-aggressive behaviors, listening to his infantile self-aggrandizing \"stories\" for the umpteenth time. Little straw: another professor's queer little control-freak tactics with the supply budget.Little straw: the other professor's incessant, stultifying boring blather as he pompously opines to his class on subject matters which are of no interest to none but him, and contain \"sage observations\" that are neither cogent nor insightful. (I realized years ago that the guy is an empty sack with a captive audience, waiting for retirement). Little straw: whiny, needy, wheedling, crybaby generation students, who think that a crisis on their part is somehow a crisis on my part. Little straw: the suck-ups, the sycophants who think that feeding the egos of their professors will grant them a higher grade. Little straw: the politics. Academicians make spiteful corporate weasels look like pikers.Little straw: the same damn faces, the same damn small talk, the same damn sameness.Ah, its a good thing I'm not a violent person. I'm burden-tolerant. You know, I worked without oxygen in the corporate world for twenty-five years.

{"title": "Dreams", "date": "Friday, May 7, 2010", "text": "I'm not sure if this subject is quite sufficiently frivolous enough for Friday. I do consider dreams important. Just not symbolic. Or not nearly so. I don't consider dreams random machinations or fluctuations of the brain thrown into (occasionally remembered) conscious view. There is some meanings attached to them. Just not the meanings we think they mean. And thus not necessarily symbolic or worthy of analysis.And I'm generally loathe to tell or listen to dream stories. As usually, since I (or you) have not experienced them, unless there is something really funny or weird, the recounting of the dream is generally uninteresting.I do think that the conscious part of our brains is just the tip of the iceberg. There is a HUGE amount of processing going on in our brains relating to memories and experiences that is excluded from conscious perception. The conscious part, the part we get to be aware of, is only at the very last part of the chain of  processing. Sometimes \"we\" (meaning are conscious mind) is completely excluded. So, should \"I\" feel bad if my brain fails to send a memo on some unconscious decision? I mean, it's my brain. Why should I feel left out? Isn't more like the captain of a ship really doesn't need to know if a bolt is replaced  down in the engine room. Does he really need a memo on it, when he has a ship to tend to? (That memo only gores so far. It would seem that \"I\" as \"captain\" of my \"ship\" am actually rarely in command. Having said all that, on with the dreams... Let's talk about the dream logic, or dream constraint. I'm sure you are familiar with it. This typically is some weird rule or restriction that your mind uses to rationalize a series of events that make no sense, or to explain a strange or contradictory or surreal situation.For example, I still remember a dream I had involving a swinger's party. It started off normally enough. I'm at a party in a standard suburban ranch house. The hostess invites me further into parts of the house that could not physically exist, the party gets a little naughty, with people in progressive states of undress. At one point, the hostess explains that those that are completely nude are ready to have sex instantly, while those retaining their undies will have sex eventually, just not at the moment. She invites me to go mingle with the nude ones. \"I'm not going to hang out with those sluts!\" I snap, and wake up.I wake up, and say \"Oh, no, no! What the hell is wrong with you, Johnny??!! OF COURSE I WANT TO MINGLE WITH THE NUDIES! IDIOT!\" But there's no going back into the dream. And I don't really worry over much about the symbolism of the dream. I know I'm not a prude, but I also know I'm not a pervert. It was just the weird setup is all.Although I have noted that I am not nearly as courageous, both physically and socially, and not nearly as upright and moral, in dreams as I am in real life. A lot of times, I'm rather ashamed of my behavior in dream life. I'm only rarely ashamed in real life.I do have recurring dreams. One in particular, which I've had for years involves living in a very dingy tawdry apartment. Were I to apply symbolism, I'd have to conclude that this apartment is my life. The problem is, I have this dream regardless of the pitfalls and fortunes I experienced. Perhaps it is merely a reminder to maintain vigilance over bad habits.Lastly, I'm quite envious of people who experience lucid or directed dreams. People who are aware they are dreaming. I've only experienced it once that I'm aware of, and it has been the recent result of no longer smoking.I'm dreaming I'm smoking a cigarette (and it is, unfortunately, fucking GREAT). then I realize I'm smoking a cigarette and get pissed at doing so. But then I realize that I am dreaming, and so the cigarette I'm smoking doesn't really count. In fact, in one dream a woman came up to me and inquired \"I thought you quit smoking?!\"And I replied, \"It's okay. I'm  dreaming right now!\"This is all well and good, but I think I'd rather be at the swinger's party."},

The amount of oil currently gushing out of the severed end of the pipeline where the Deepwater Horizon rig used to be - some 200,000 gallons a day, estimated to perhaps as much as three times as much - is equal to the amount of oil the US consumes from all of our offshore rigs.In other words, the potential hundreds of billions of dollars in environmental damage in comparison to how petroleum independent offshore drilling makes the US of A equates exactly to- hang on, let me get the calculator - divide by seven, carry the three, ah! here we go! exactly JACK-SHIT!ON a more positive note, lest you think I do nothing but bitch, there are things you can do to help.Human hair, believe it or not, does an unbelievable job of sucking up oil.

I'd prefer to do it more often, but my students don't produce enough stuff. Enough talk, more pictures!Here is a picture of me and my foundry assistant of the day, Adam Bacon, pouring molten bronze into a mold. The mold is ceramic shell, which is a very thin tough ceramic material that you form around a wax model, and then melt the wax out. The bronze is around 2000F, which is why we wear the Spaceman Spiff suits. You notice how Adam is crouching? That's because...Adam is 6 feet 8 inches tall. Yes, he's a big boy. More than half of my class are retired. That's not unusual. Of those, at least half again are little old ladies. They are in the thick of things like nobody's business. We also get little young ladies...Some so tiny they can barely get the crucible out of the furnace. That doesn't slow 'em down, though. Heres' a shot I'm including only because I looked at it and thought \"Oh, my god. It's my dad!\"I'm shouting at them to pour faster. But, you  know, in a nice way!Lastly, here's an interesting shot from last spring. I quit smoking back in September. The reason the following is an interesting shot now is, back then you couldn't find a picture of me where I didn't have a  cigarette to hand:Hopefully, those days are behind me.Anyway, we had fun, and nobody got hurt."},

I can feel my brow get broader, my eyes get set closer together, my teeth get all snaggly and lose, and my head feels lighter as my brain sheds two-thirds of its mass. The outward appearance, the pigshit under my fingernails, the grease-encrusted coveralls, the John Deere cap, are completely superfluous to the experience.It is kind of a weird out-of-body experience, when I, with an intellect comparatively vast and cool and unsympathetic, can look down at the bumptious buffoon, and watch its slow, glacial thoughts as it tries to work through national politics, like a chimp trying to do high-energy physics.Invariably, this creature would seems to be a creature of the south, and more specifically, the southwest, and even more specifically, given the topical nature of this essay, a denizen of that benighted land known as Arizona.It's always been amusing to hear about states that wish to secede from the Union. I've often wished that perhaps it should occur, at least for the entertainment value. Watching, say, youtube videos of the Texas Navy trying to defend its oil tankers in the Persian Gulf has got to be worth all the trouble that would ensue from secession. And, like in some TV sitcom, Texas would see the error of its ways, and like some hapless teenage runaway, a little scuffed up but none too worse for wear, would eventually come back home to a nice cool glass of milk and a comfy PB&J sammich. Oh, you scamp! Lesson learned, eh sport?On the other hand, no state has ever been asked to leave the Union, but maybe its about time. And let my inner redneck explain...\"EVER BEEN TUH ARIZONIE? ITS ALREDY INFULTRAYTED!!! FLAT BROWN FAYCES AND A SING-SONG JIBBER-JABBER EVER WHERE YOU GO!!!!\"He's right, and though I'm not sure why he talks in all capital letters, sad to say, but its true. Arizona has reached a crisis state. It's been taken over by little brown people. Even the Slightly Larger White People there don't speak proper English anymore. To prevent the apocalyptic tide of aliens from entering our country, building a wall at the border is no longer an option.It's like when you get a pesky spot of gangrene, you don't want it to spread throughout your body? You do what's right and remove the limb. And that's what we gotta do. Oh, we could try a series of holding actions, we could try implement half-measures, like the current illegal immigration law. But ultimately, it won't wash.We've got to build a wall around Arizona.  And cut off the water supply (because that's, you know, our Federally subsidized water those illegals are drinking). And shoot at anything that moves. With lasers. Gamma ray lasers.As far as legitimate citizens of the United States living in Arizona are concerned... well, fellow Patriots, your sacrifice will not go unheralded. Perhaps your chief employers, the State of Arizona, and Walmart, can lend you a helping hand, but hard choices must be made. We salute you. Please stay clear of the new border.  Or else.Love,Your former countryfolk"},

Pretend we didn't hear?You know, I'm not sure when the media crowned Hawking as the Pope of Science, but as long as they've given him the job, I think he should be forced to wear the funny hat. I'm not sure what you call that hat, a mitre? And anyway, is  Hawking the Pope of Science because he's crippled and therefore must automatically be a nice guy? The same way Einstein (the last Pope) had funny hair and therefore must have been a dork and therefore was a nice guy as well? And because of that, any silly thing that pops out of their mouths should be taken as, in capital letters, something we Need To Pay Attention  To?You know what? In capital letters, Fuck That. Once an expert starts talking outside of their field of expertise, their opinion is likely no better informed than mine. So, Steve, that's nice about the aliens and all, but, uh, don't you have more important things to do?And besides, I'm actually quite disappointed with Hawking's lack of vision. Granted, this is all PR for a show produced for the Discovery Channel, so I'm not expecting anything profound or insightful, but still... Come on, Steve."},

It doesn't really matter what type of map it is - political, geophysical, population, ethnic, raw materials, you name it.The stranger thing is that all of my brothers, including me, will take atlases into the bathroom for a sit down. All of us have our preferences. I like to look at (in no particular order):I am drawn to the Kerguelen Island archipelago. It's down near Antarctica, is not particularly clement, has some active volcanoes, and I've no idea why I'm fascinated with it, or the Indian Ocean.I also like:I like to pretend I can go down there, to the bottom of the ocean, and walk about without protection, with millions of pounds of water on top of me. In reality, it's silly. I'd be crushed like a bug, and couldn't see anything anyway. But I like the idea of tramping about on the ocean floor.Here's one I'm completely mystified about as to why I like it, or why I would like to go there:Honestly, why the hell would I want to go there? It's a freaking war zone, or should be. I might as well go to the Balkans while I'm at it. I think maybe I'm fascinated because it the Caucasus region consists of mountains and valleys, and every valley contains a whole different ethnicity. Kind of like New Guinea. I know we think they are all swarthy unwashed mustachioed characters with stinky yogurt breath, but I still think it would be interesting.Second to last of the list:I know Spain is the #1 tourist attraction in the world. I don't know how popular Galicia, the northwest corner, is, and the funny thing is, I don't even want to go there. I just like looking at the map.And lastly (though the list is nowhere near complete):This is a place I'd like to go to I think. The Baltic Sea Basin, and pretty much most of the countries that border it. I been to some places there and don't really need to go back. Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany. There are places I don't want to visit anyway. Poland, Russia, Estonia. That leaves Lithuania, Finland, Latvia. I'd kind of like to go there.

{"title": "Death By Plastic", "date": "Thursday, April 22, 2010", "text": "Two summers ago, or was it three?, I happened to read a book called \"World Without Us\" by Alan Weisman. It chronicled what would happen to all our stuff if we suddenly disappeared. Never mind how we went, the point was what would happen to our civilization, our buildings, artifacts, etc. It wouldn't take long for most of it to disappear soon after us. Broken down and absorbed by the planetary forces both organic and not.Except plastics.Apparently, plastics are indestructible.I've always been somewhat conscientious when it comes to picking up trash. If I see some crap laying around, I'll pick it up. But I became doubly conscious of plastic trash after reading this book. I go out of my way to pick it up now. Much to my alarm, the reading of this book was the first time I'd ever heard of the Pacific Garbage Patch - that Texas-sized-and-growing gyre of floating plastic crap. Since then six more (to my knowledge) have been discovered, including a North Atlantic version.The problem is, since there are currently no microbes that do a good job of breaking down the tough polymer bonds of plastics, they stick around forever. Oh, that's not entirely true. Plastic pieces do break down into smaller and smaller pieces. Possibly to the point where they become indestructible little microscopic pieces - small enough to clog up filter feeders like baleen whales, and  sponges, and clams and mussels. Possibly small enough to clog up plankton.That would be a hell of a thing. Plankton die offs, the bottom of the food chain, choked to death on plastics? And then the famine slowly makes its way up the food chain until it gets to us.Likely? I really don't want to find out any more than I want to know what drowning in my own puke is like.Death by plastic. For an intelligent species, it's an embarrassing way to go extinct."},
{"title": "\"Blue Collar Protective Coloration\"", "date": "Wednesday, April 21, 2010", "text": "That was the phrase my brother used to describe me. That's what I wore, so that people would not realize I was quite as white collar and educated as I might actually be. Because we in America are much more accepting of the stupid. We are, and always have been, anti-intellectual. We appreciate clever, but not smart. Well, I can pull stupid off pretty effectively. It helps that I have interesting looking scars on my hands, can slip into a Hoosier twang as needed, and drop a lot of F-bombs... probably a lot more than the situation requires.My hands. They really are working-class messed up. The funny thing is, I'm one of those fortunate few whose skin heals rapidly and completely. I used to have a really nasty four-inch-long 3rd degree burn scar on my forearm about ten years ago. (I got it when red hot metal rod fell on me and I warded it off with my upraised arm. Middling long story). Anyway, there's just a pencil-eraser-sized pink patch now. Looks like I got burned with a punk.Once, about ten years ago, I was down for the count with a double hernia operation for about three weeks. And then again, around 2004 or so, I contracted - and killed off - the West Nile virus. That put me in bed for about two weeks.On both occasions, after weeks of  inactivity, I noticed that my hands looked... weird. Not quite right. Unusual. Abnormal.I finally figured it out. They had no bruises, cuts, gashes, contusions, burns, scrapes,  scratches, scuff marks, lacerations, or nicks on them. To my horror, I was even losing calluses. (Although actually, my hands are quite smooth and genteel compared to some farmers I know). I never realized how proud I was of having such grisly looking hands. But Nature, the perverse old bitch, insists upon healing them so I don't look like such a tough guy.Jeez, what's a guy got to do? Intentionally mutilate myself? Pass. I'll just have to accept the fact that Nature wants me to be a beautiful creature.Okay, you can stop laughing now."},
{"title": "The Secret to Life is...", "date": "Monday, April 19, 2010", "text": "...not to get too upset about stuff. The minute something is resolved, the next thing comes along, and then where are you? In a permanent state of pant shitting, that's where.And speaking of pant shitting, the professionals are having a bunch of little celebrations. I'm talking about the Patriot's Day (April 19th) gun rights rallies being staged   at various points of the compass throughout our nation. Poor old April 19th. It's really suffered what with the recent Waco-Oklahoma City connection.  It used to be all about the Revolutionary War. You know, Shot heard Round the World and all that. Not anymore. And that poor old word \"patriot\" has suffered equally, what with the fishbelly-white, pampered, privileged, slovenly-fat, doughy-assed disgusting soft-bodies over at the Tea Party trying to confiscate it.But the 2nd Amendment? In need of protection? Can you think of a more artificially manufactured non-issue? I mean, is there any problem at all, EVER, in obtaining or using a gun in this country? No. I don't think so. Now, let's be clear about this. I think there is a gun problem, but I am not anti-gun. I've shot pretty near everything from little pea-shooter John Hinckley .22 pistols up to AK-47s. A gun is like any other object, dangerous only in the hands of the dangerously stupid. I myself keep and bear arms. I'm a gun owner from way back.  Here's a fun little story to illustrate it.A few years ago, I attended a party of a friend who's father-in-law was a homicide detective for the city of Chicago. I'm drinking beers, bullshitting with the guy in the kitchen, and I finally notice his holstered gun at his side.\"Is that a Beretta 9mm?\", I asked him.\"Sure is\", he replied, pulling the gun out. He paused a second. \"Uh, you know how to use this?\"\"Dude! I'm from Indiana!\"He handed it right over.I can't say I was practically weaned on a firearm. That would be an exaggeration. But I was thoroughly and constantly trained in safe use. And that is my mightiest concern about guns. Especially hand guns.Those in the know, know that you can maintain your marksmanship with rifles at an acceptable level with, shit, once-a-year sessions. But it takes constant practice to keep in shape with a handgun. Ask any cop or vet. And if people, especially that segment of the American populace (90% general populace, and 99.95% Tea Party \"patriot\"s) that I would not trust to wipe their own ass with two outspread hands, let alone a firearm, wish to own them, then they damn sure better know how to use them.So, I really see no commonsense reason why firearms should not only be licensed, but the individuals who own them should be licensed as well.I mean, crap, you prove you can operate a motor vehicle. Why not a gun?"},
{"title": "712 East Hunter St.", "date": "Friday, April 16, 2010", "text": "This will be a short entry, as I'm busy burning out shells today.What?I'm burning out shells for my students. Ceramic shells. You know, investment shells?Okay, I'll explain. In teaching bronze casting, we use a technique called lost wax ceramic shell investment. The current technique was developed for casting complex metal shapes in the aerospace and automotive industry, like turbine blades. The method itself is quite ancient, so maybe using that motif as an explanation may help.So, let's say you make a little guy, like say a voodoo doll, out of wax. And then you fashion a little wax funnel to stick on his head. Next you mix up a batch of slurry - muddy clay and horse dung with water added until it is about the consistency of pancake batter. Dip the little wax man in the slurry. Sprinkle with sand to make a a stucco. Let dry. Dip again. Repeat until a fairly thick layer, perhaps a 1/4 inch thick layer has built up. This clay layer is called an investment.Build a fire. Place the clay and sand encased wax figure in the fire, upside down so the wax melts out. Fire until the clay is hard, until it becomes a ceramic. The ceramic is now hollow, it is like a shell. Turn it right side up, and pour molten metal through the funnel into the hollow shell. Allow to cool. Bust ceramic off. You have a little metal voodoo doll, which is kind of useless now as you cannot stick pins into him.So, that is what we do in my class, but the materials are more space age. We used colloidal silica liquid and silica flour for the slurry. And fused silica for the sand for the stucco. I will put the student wax pieces, covered in ceramic, into our big gas kiln, and melt the wax out, then continue the firing to burn up the carbon residue. Thus, wax burnout.So, while I am doing this, my thoughts drifted back to college. To the most idyllic time in college, when my older brother and I rented out a house at 712 E Hunter St. in Bloomington, Indiana. The house is still around. I google street viewed it.The last time I talked to my brother, I asked, how long were we in that house?\"Seventeen... eighteen... years?\"\"I know! It felt like that, didn't it? Two years.\"\"No!\"\"Yeah!\"The reason it seemed like such a long time, I think, is because we almost immediately regressed to the level of three-year-olds once we moved into the house. Every aspect of the house invited us to. It was a giant playland. The neighborhood was all college rentals, and so it was like small party village. The house itself had a large backyard, hidden from view by bushes and trees. It had a giant front porch, with two overstuffed couches on it. One was the regular couch, and the other was the bee couch. The bee couch used to be a regular couch, but then a bunch of bumble bees built a nest in one of the arms. We sat in it anyway and just left them alone - until one day a guest got stung, and then we got a new couch. The bee couch went into the alley and disappeared in about a half hour. The house had a spacious dining room and kitchen, perfect for entertaining. Somehow, I ended up as house chef, and made, you know, bachelor chow: beef stew, chili, spaghetti and meatballs, tuna casserole, stuff like that. I never had any complaints.Most importantly though, the house had a Batcave.No, really. The house had a basement extending throughout the entire foundation. The garage was in the basement, as was, obviously, the garage entrance. The backyard was elevated with respect to the garage entrance, and there was a limestone retaining wall which hid the garage entrance from the alley. Thus, an underground Batcave, which was how we thought of it.The Batcave served a number of purposes. Obviously it was a garage, where we kept Elvis, our Ford F150 P.O.S. pickup truck, which resided there until it died of senile dementia. First it rusted out, and we replaced a lot of the skin with riveted sheet metal. By the end, Elvis kind of looked like a B-47 bomber. After Elvis left the building, my brother moved his VW station wagon in. The Batcave was still large enough for \"hobbyist\" activities, such as a, ahem, \"greenhouse\", a shooting gallery, a \"chemistry set\", a ping pong table, and still roomy enough to host the occasional \"Viking Night\".(\"Viking Nights\" occurred when a rare item was found abandoned somewhere around the city which was deemed interesting enough to destroy, like a TV, or a car. We would have various demolition tools available, and after preliminary festivities, my brother or I made more-or-less symbolic swipes at the the object, and then turned it over to the mob. Usually, at least one person was injured - collateral damage from overenthusiastic creative destruction, which is why we also had a first-aid kit on hand).What else? Oh crap! We built a giant bubble machine one summer. We had stumbled upon a book at the library which contained a recipe for long-lasting soap bubbles (secret ingredient: glycerine). Not happy with making regular bubbles, we constructed a motorized swing arm witha rope at the end that dipped into a pan of soap solution, and then swung the rope in a big arc like a skip rope. We could produce bubbles that were three to four feet in diameter. We set a record on one calm and humid Southern Indiana night of about three blocks worth of giant bubbles cruising down the street - shimmering and wobbling down the street at about head level and moving at a stately walking pace. I think that caused an accident.And I can't remember ever studying there. Honestly its a wonder I graduated with a halfway decent grade-point average."},
{"title": "Tea Party Poll", "date": "Thursday, April 15, 2010", "text": "CBS/NYTimes did a poll this week identifying Tea Party supporters and activists. The numbers are enlightening.59% are male, pale, and stale29% are welfare geezers 58% own firearms53% describe themselves as \"angry\", so it's a good thing they own guns24% say violence against the government is justified, so watch it58% believe America's best years are behind it, so maybe they should move someplace nicer78% are hypocritical dumbasses, but don't know itThose are some interesting numbers. Where to start? How about that just last metric, as most would object to it and it demands the biggest explanation.Why are they dumbasses? Well, according to the poll, 37% of the Tea Partiers are college educated (versus 25% of the normal population) and yet, they possess a rather horrifying lack of knowledge and curiosity about politics, business, their government, and their history. They all want limited, small, unintrusive government. Well, we tried that once, under the Articles of Confederation at the end of the 18th century. Remember that? The conditions were so chaotic that it resulted in a Consitutional Crisis in 1787. I guess they want to go back to a period when businesses could not thrive, when the court system was so weak that trade and property rights could not be enforced, when state currencies were worth less than the paper they were printed on, when trade and transportation tariffs brought interstate commerce to a standstill. Yeah, that period of limited government was great for business and the citizenry!How about our disastrous flirtation with lassez-faire capitalism throughout the 19th century?Want me to sum up that period? Big guys cornholing the little guys. That is the closest we ever came to a truly free free-market economy, with little or no government intervention. Fraud, theft, and graft were rampant. Intellectual and physical property rights were a bad joke. Patents were stolen more often than roylaties paid out for them. The courts were clogged with lawsuits. Businesses colluded with each other to keep prices high and products shitty. Labor was exploited to keep costs low. Child labor. Slave labor. Product quality was shoddy at best, lethal at worst. I suppose the Tea Partiers would prefer to return to the Golden Age when filth was in our food, poisons in our medicines, con men in our businesses,  and politicians were firmly in the pockets of rich criminals. Those were good times!Tea Partiers bemoan how the current state of affairs goes against the intention of the Founding Fathers, and yet they really have no clue as to what those intentions actually were. Few have ever read the Constitution. Fewer still have read, but will cite, the Federalist Papers. Hey, here's clue #1, dumbasses. You won't find the Federalist Papers in the Constitution, so stop referring to them as if they were part of the National Canon. They are the rationalization behind the Constitution, and all disputes aside, the Founding Fathers came down squarely on teh side of a strong central government. Why? Oh, something about a stable currency.And besides, if you idiots (TP'ers) did read any of our nation's history - not just what Glenn Beck tells you how it was - you'd know that there was constant revisions to the way things were done in between, say, 1787, and 1815. they had these things called amendments, dumbasses. You might want to read the Constitution sometime.Of course, the other part, the hypocrisy stems from the fact that these Tea Partiers want their government services, but don't want to pay for them. How so? Well, the majority are currently either on Social Security and Medicare, or soon will be. And yet, somehow, they think they are deserving of these services. That somehow, they paid up already. Bullshit. This has never been the arrangment. The current workforce pays for the current crop of retirees. The Tea Partiers paid for the last generation's retirement, and there's no reason for we workers to pay for their retirement. Why should today's workers shell out their hard earned cash for these socialist parasites? It is not like they are ENTITLED to it. Especially when they should have been showing a little capitalist initiative and foresight, and saved their own goddamn money for their retirement like responsible people do. And since the intent of Social Security was to prevent a complete slide into poverty of the elderly poor, the poorest of the poor, why are those able to fend for themselves feeding at the public trough? Selfish, greedy, entitled, hypocritical, communist piggies - the worst kind of Commie: Republican Commies.Come to think of it, the government has been raiding Medicare and Social Security for decades now in order to pay for other government services. Raiding these funds because it lacks proper revenue. Revenue that should have been received in the form of taxes, but did not. So, today's crop of retirees, having made full use of these government services, such as public defense, infrastructure, social services, shcools, parks, police, fire, libraries, etc., why, these fuckers have been double dipping. I think its time their taxes were raised to pay for all the free shit these assholes have gotten and whine about having."},
{"title": "Welcome to the Future.", "date": "Tuesday, April 13, 2010", "text": "This will be a short essay.Happy New Year!Yes, yes, I know New Years' was four months ago. But everyone was writing about it then. No one writes about it now, which makes it the perfect time to stand out.Happy New Year!It's the year 2010, and for some reason, it feels like I'm in the future. That number, I suppose, does it. When I was younger, say, back in the 1960s, the year 2000 or 2001 was going to be the future. Walter Cronkite had a briefly running science show called \"The 21st Century\". It was about the future stuff that was going to happen in the future, and it even had a weird machine music at the beginning of the show to let you know it was about the future. There were magazine articles and books about the future, and most of them used 2000 as a benchmark, as a watershed date. There was even a movie called \"2001\", which I'm pretty sure was about the future because most of it took place in outer space - except for the beginning of the movie which had a lot of monkeys hitting each other with bones.I think there are watershed dates, at least in the USA. At least for me. For example, to me, 1848 is the beginning of the Modern Age. You'd think it would be the year 1900, but I say it was the year 1848, because of all sorts of things that got started - like the first university scientific institutions, the first glimmerings of socialism, civic sanitation, underground public transportation, and stuff like that. For some, 1973 is a watershed year. They say it was the beginning of the decline of the middle class, wage stagnation, the end of cheap fossil fuels, the end of the postwar boom in America. I don't know if that's true. I was pretty stoned then.I'd also throw in 1995, the beginning of the information age, when the Internet really took off, the end of the welfare state (and the reversal in the decline of the poverty rate), the year the Republicans made it official that they preferred partisan interests over the interests of  the nation. And, of course, the year 2000, which was when the Future was going to begin.But, you  know, 2000 came and went for me, and then 2001, and I didn't feel any different. Same old stuff, really. Not much change. Oh sure, changes, but so gradual that you don't really notice it.But for some reason, that number 2010, I got the feeling I was entering alien terrain. New territory was opening up. Everything looked the same, but there was a different feel about the place. Hard to explain.Anyway, I think I'm finally in the future with a capital F.You know, yesterday, I went to the future.And here I am!"},
{"title": "Do (other) Animals Commit Murder?", "date": "Monday, April 12, 2010", "text": "My friend Ellen Abbott published a dismayed journal entry about humanity's penchant for violence. I offered a few comments to her essay, which she responded to. Rather than continue the dialogue (as such) with the commentary, I felt it worth an essay. Let's recap from her comments:Ellen: \"I wonder though if this is something that is peculiar to humans only or if other creatures, given our level of intelligence, would exhibit the same behavior. Perhaps it's the price of higher brain function. Being at the top of the food chain, we must function as our own predator\".This is a worthwhile question, but let's preface it with her previous observation so that it is within context.Ellen (responding to my point 2): \"And although animals in nature kill, they kill for food. They kill to protect their young and to protect their territory (an exception, wolves and chimpanzees do engage in territorial skirmishes in packs) but they do not devise instruments of torture, they do not burn their own kind at the stake, they do not hang/draw and quarter/post the body parts on stakes, they don't turn their intelligence to weapons of mass destruction, they don't drag a man behind their truck for sport til he is barely recognizable as a man. (And according to certain scholars the commandant was not 'thou shall not kill' but rather 'thou shall not murder').\"In other words, to summarize (and I'm pretty sure I've got the point): \"Do other animals kill for pleasure? Do they torture?\"To this I would say, \"Yes\" and \"yes\". Any observant pet owner can guess that cats and dogs clearly enjoy killing things. I would hazard a guess that any predator of sufficiently complex brain organization also enjoys killing things. Is this murder? Well, if we go with my definition, killing purely for the joy of it, then yes.It has been documented, for example, that many dolphins kill, rape, bully, and harass not only members of their own species, but other cetaceans and aquatic mammals. Killer whales (not really whales, but the biggest  members of the dolphin clan), will \"play with their food\" - often tormenting, savaging, and  tossing seals and other prey between themselves in games of catch. Cetaceans experts, when asked about these behaviors, will rather hesitantly surmise that \"they could be doing it for fun\". Now, there  is good reason for them to be hesitant. The obvious caution is what is called anthropocentrism: ascribing human attitudes and attributes to non-human animals. Ethologists, scientists who study animals, often try to derive what animal minds are doing from overt behavior, and try to avoid assigning intentions to them. Attitudes are changing, however. As we learn more and more about brain structures, the commonality of brain function and behavior, it is slowly becoming popular to think that animals do indeed experience the same emotions we do. They feel joy, pain, pleasure, fear, suffering.But, reverse that to the true notion, we have inherited all of our brain structures from life that came before us. We experience the same things animals do. We do so because we are animals. Now, whether animals experience the joy of the kill as we do, may still be speculation, but I consider it a safe bet. From there, I would suggest that the observed overt behavior of joy of the kill is in fact a real internal mental state in animals. However, I suspect there are two necessary conditions. The first is that of sufficient brain complexity. The animal must be sufficiently smart to be able to cogitate that the act plus the feeling equals the experience that can be repeated. In other words, it has to be smart enough to realize it can reward itself (in this admittedly gruesome way).And the second condition ( and I think the more important) is that the animal must be social enough. Social animals while not strictly speaking in possession of a culture, nevertheless can pick up behaviors from each other. Violence, at least for creatures on Earth, is an escalating hierarchy. Display threats come first, then the application of pain with minimal injury, then actually injury, then mutilation and maiming, then death. If a confrontation can be resolved at a lower level, it rarely ever moves to the next. Some biologists explain this as the result of microbes - the increased risk of infection and death has resulted in this hierarchy. I don't know if this is true, but the levels of confrontation in Nature certainly exist.   (This hierarchy of violence also seems to work not just at the individual level, but at the group level as well. Case in point. When the Roman Empire split in two back during Constantine's reign, you saw two fundamentally distinct strategies evolve. The western half (what we think of as the Roman half) continued its policy of war by attrition. The Eastern half (called the Byzantine Empire, but really the Roman Empire during the Middle Ages) followed a more flexible policy of appeasement/alliances/containment/conquest. The western half, pursuing the extreme, soon ran out of resources, and fell to barbarians. The eastern half, whose fortunes waxed and waned, lasted well into the 13th century. You tell me which strategy is better).These are my, admittedly completely speculative and wholly undocumented, thoughts on the matter. I leave you with this, though. We must ask the question of when the quality of mercy enter into behavior? A certain empathy exists in most creatures. The question is, is this another form of the confrontation hierarchy, or is a certain complexity of behavior and socialization required?"},
{"title": "\"Hello, Old Friend\"", "date": "Friday, April 9, 2010", "text": "Normally, by my self-imposed, wholly artificial and arbitrary rules, I write only about shallow, selfish, self-centered superficial fun stuff on Fridays.Well, this time out I'm going to write about something important, and throw in a plug while I'm at it.One of things I like to do is check out the followers of other online journals that I follow. I will, on occasion, stumble upon something interesting that way. That's how I found out about Velvet Over Steel.  No, it's not some kind of kinky S&M journal, but rather something that is part of my life that maybe you don't know about.I have a nephew, Zach, who is an Aspie, which is to say he displays those aneurotypcial symptoms that are categorized as Asperger's syndrome, and in turn falls within that spectrum of disorders known as autism. And since he is a very, very, very bright kid, he is what they call \"high-functioning\". And seeing that April is Autism Awareness Month, this entry is my plug for it all. Admittedly, not much of an effort on my part, but hey, better than nothing. There's a lot of information out there about this topic, but I think the best information of all is that, in some cases, and over time, the condition can improve.Funny thing is, I suspect that myself and my brothers are all mildly within the spectrum. The baby brother, for example, has that unusual savant skill of being able to tell you which day of the week a date is on. We'd tease him about it. He'd say something like, \"Yeah, that happened April 5th, 1971\". And we'd respond \"A Tuesday\". And he rejoin \"No, Wednesday-\" and then he'd notice we are all grinning and that we are teasing him.Myself, I used to wonder why others had such a hard time remembering everything they'd ever seen or heard or read. My memory is not phenomenal, hardly comprehensive or photographic, but I suspect it is way above average. (Although I've noticed with alarm that it is rapidly deteriorating with age).So, it is entirely possible the family is in the spectrum.  Zach certainly is. I've had less contact with him that I would have like over the years - seeing as his parents live on the West Coast. But I've had enough contact to know that he is just a really great kid. Very smart, very quick and bright, and sometimes kind of skittish like a colt. He likes the computer games, and rock music, and girls, and honestly, to me, he's really just another teenager, but not quite as obnoxious. Here's a picture of me and him, taken last fall. A very good-looking kid, don't you think? He favors his mother, fortunately. I just hope he got that side of the family's hair as well.  And he's going to be tall, although I'm not sure how that is possible, given that he lives on scrambled eggs, PB&J sandwiches, and pizza.The title of this essay is my greeting to him from almost the day of his birth. \"Hello, old friend\". I want him to know that I'm more than just his father's brother, but an old and dear and steadfast friend. Someone he can always count on.I'd be willing to bet that someone you  love, or someone you know who loves someone, has autism.Well, this is the someone I love.Happy Friday!"},
{"title": "Geography", "date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2010", "text": "Quickly now, what's the world's population?About six billion, right?Right now, as I type, it is estimated to be six billion, eight hundred and twelve million, one hundred fifty-five thousand, nine hundred twenty-five.Officially, according to the World Bank, the world's population in 2008 was (oh, I'm not gonna type it all out) 6,692,030,277.Whoa! Where did that .6 to .8 billion people come from? I mean, seems to me just a few short years ago it was six billion. (Well, it turns out that milestone happened on Oct. 12, 1999. Time flies when you are having fun).Okay, so no, this isn't one of those oh-dearie-dear-overpopulation-we're-doomed essays. Let me continue.What's the US population? Well, we got a census brewing, so the numbers will change, but currently the number is around 309,016,000 or so. We won't quibble, since the numbers will change soon anyway.Ah, but what a change. Seems to me, our population is growing pretty rapidly. The Gen-X and Yer's seem to be much more family oriented than the Boomers. They're popping out babies for a whole new Boom. Baby Boom II. And without a major war needed to, what, fuck themselves out of the bad times? Or celebrate the good times? At any rate, we're chugging along at about an 8% growth rate.Which actually is making me feel optimistic about things.A few essays back, I lamented about how we are losing all our innovation to China, on account of one of our companies is building a massive R&D lab over there. And I suppose I started to feel the old American defeatism.You know how it goes. First, it was Russia that was going to kick our ass. Then Japan. Then China. Thing is, it never really happens. I wonder if we do this to ourselves so that we can feel like the underdog and play \"that most American of games: Catch-up\".Well, I've found an essay that changes my mind. You can read it here, or you can keep reading what I have to say, since I'll kind of summarize and plagiarize it.I think we as a nation still have a few miles left in us.Some facts help, so let's whip out the facts. And you know, I always did like geography in grade school. I like looking at maps. I like looking at charts and graphs. For some reason, I've always liked bar graphs. And I like looking at the pictures in geography books, with all those quaint little people dressed up in their colorful ethnic costumes. But I digress...Fact: The fertility rate in America is 50% again what it is in Russia, Germany, or Japan. And much higher than China. We will more than likely hit the half a billion strong mark around 2050 or so. And we will be a nation of youngsters, perhaps as little as a quarter of our population will be over 60. In comparison, China, Europe, Russia, Japan, will be hobbled with old fuckers all over the place. Take from this the following: America will continue to be a young, vibrant, vigorous nation.Fact: Aside from our native born, we continue to attract lots of immigrants, and thank goodness for that. Yes, despite the short-sighted fat, white, lazy Republican butthead view that illegal immigrants are bad for the country, the opposite holds. Half the world's skilled immigrants come to the US. Increasingly, they are well-off immigrants that bring they're monies along with them, and set up business here. Between 1990 and 2005, immigrants started nearly a quarter  of the new public-backed venture companies here. Take from this the following: Yes, we do have some enterprising go-getters that are native-born, but it is our immigrants that are hungry enough to drive things forward. Bully on them!Fact: Well, this one I'll just quote directly: \"The United States already measures at the top or close to the top of nearly every global measure of economic competitiveness. A comprehensive 2008 Rand Corporation study found that the U.S. leads the world in scientific and technological development. The U.S. now accounts for a third of the world’s research-and-development spending. Partly as a result, the average American worker is nearly 10 times more productive than the average Chinese worker, a gap that will close but not go away in our lifetimes.\" Take from this the following: Since science and technology account for more than half the drive of our economic engine, I suspect we are in for some really great boom times ahead. Fact: America has been ruled by some of the worst leaders that civilized man can possibly produce. Not just the executive office, Congress included, not to mention, state, county, and local authorities. Why, you could set up a lottery of random choices for any office in the land, and you certainly could not do worse. Take from this the following: We Americans have iron in every generation. And we can carry, have carried, this nation through the rapids on our great broad backs on more than one occasion.Now, you would think, after all my bad news (and I haven't actually told you ALL my bad bews) of the past few days, that I should not be so cheerful and chipper.Well, I don't know. I'm easily distracted?"},

{"title": "Easter Egg Hunt", "date": "Friday, April 2, 2010", "text": "As a youngster, I never cared much for ham with pineapples, or any sweet fruit. Oh, I like it well enough now. That tolerance is more likely because as an (presumed) adult, I'm more... tolerant... of exotic foods now. But there will always be a Young Republican ensconced in the back of my brain who insists that Meat Should Be Salty, Not Sweet.I do, however, really dig au gratin potatoes. And potato pancakes? Oh my! Get out the jism deflector.Why this food rap? I'm thinking of long ago at Grandma's house. Easter time. She would always cook a ham. And we would have potatoes with it. Oh, we also had to go to church. And I had to wear a suit, with a starched shirt that made my neck itch, and wearing one of those dorky little red bowties. I probably looked like a Hitler youth. And that time of year down in Indianapolis, it was just starting to get warm. And this was before even the conceptualization of air conditioning (something people in the far future, like in the year 2000, would enjoy). So it was hot and stuffy and stale and smelled of perfumed old lady stink and sticky bibles.But then we'd get to go back to Grandma and Grandpa's house, and we'd have to stay indoors while the Old Man hid the Easter eggs. Which was fine by Mom because we then avoided getting grass stains on the knees of our little dress pants. And to occupy the time, we'd be assigned chores like setting the table, until the eggs had been safely secured.Now, one thing you have to know about the Old Man is, he didn't get to have a childhood, or not much of one. And so, fortunately for us, he lived his childhood out vicariously through his children. Which, in retrospect, even though we didn't have much money, meant that we were spoiled as hell. Big bucks were spent upon a shitload of candy in those color plastic eggs, and then of course the huge Easter baskets with the green plastic grass and jelly beans and chocolate bunnies and so  on.The other thing you need to know about the Old Man is, since he was a Kraut, uh, I mean an American of German extraction, the hiding of the Easter eggs was a very serious thing. Like War with a capital W. Like the history of Prussian logistics. Like a well planned Spring offensive. And so the hiding of the eggs was a devious, convoluted, time consuming, and actually quite sadistically evil affair. And we children were not permitted to quit the fight and leave the field until every, I mean every, single egg had been found. Even the ones hidden beyond the reach of a twelve year old deep within culvert under the driveway. Even the one nestled twelve feet in the air in the crook of a thorn tree with jackdaws defending the nest.But, eventually the hunt would be over, and we children would munch on our candy: bruised, dirty, bleeding, crying perhaps a little bit.But really the crying was muted, only a few sobs worked out around a mouthful of sugar."},
{"title": "Working Out", "date": "Thursday, April 1, 2010", "text": "According to the National Institutes for Health, a standard BMI for someone like me (I'm 5' 10\" and 195 pounds), should be 18.5 - 24.9. For the longest time, I was at 28.5, which is considered overweight.Yeah, overweight if I was from Bangladesh perhaps. But in America, that's skinny. Actually, its fit, considering I've got an athletic build. It is obviously not taking into account muscle mass. I'm assuming that they are calculating this metric based upon the fact that I am composed of approximately 40% beef lard, and 15% bone meal, and perhaps 5% kibbles & bits. Then it would be realistic to say I'm overweight.But you know, ever since I've quit smoking, I've experienced a really alarming gain in my Body Mass Index. Well, again I have been working out pretty heavily. I realized I'd be gaining 10 extra pounds once I quit smoking, and so I anticipated this by hitting the gym. Lots of cardio, which has helped with the spare tire (not that I had one to begin with). And of course, lots of weight lifting. Actually a ton of weight lifting, and perhaps I've gone a bit overboard. I've turned myself into a monster. Huge.I recalculated my BMI today, and it is 102.5!Which means I weigh 715 pounds. Which is not right. I weigh no more than 500. I've also gained a foot in height, so it has evened out. But only when I get angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.Nah. Lame joke. April Fools."},

Again. For the hundredth time. (And there is a John Kurman in Kansas City, MO that I may have to kill one of these days, just so that I can be the only John Kurman on the planet. No. I wouldn't do that. Kansas City Johnny is probably pretty safe, for now, and for reasons that will become obvious in the next paragraph).Well, the very first entry was a \"Are you a fucking stupid asshole?\" test on OK cupid. My natural inclination is to say \"No. No, I am not\", but I took the test anyway. I'm happy to report that I'm only 4% fucking stupid asshole, which makes a generally nice guy, and also puts me ahead of the pack, which averages at 10% fucking stupid asshole.So, I got that going for me.Next on the google list are two songs entitled \"You Stupid Asshole\". One by the Angry Samoans, and the other Mudhoney. Mmmm, am I gonna listen to them? Nah. Moving along...Next, ah, of course, neighbors complain. Stupid Asshole Neighbor abusing Noise Violation on yelp.com. I'd have thought that would be entry number one.Next, an email complaint addressed to somethingawful.com. Again no big surprises there.Next, a definition for stupid asshole on urban dictionary. Do we really need that? Perhaps for all the newcomers to our magic land (And welcome to you!), you know, those not so familiar with slang, or English as a Second Language crowd. So, it nice to see public service entries like this.Next, another song reference to the Angry Samoans. I guess they are angry after all.Next, and finishing off the first google page of 685,000: \"Kanye West and Cindy Sheehan Are Stupid Assholes\", from...kanyewest-cindysheehanstupidassholes.blogspot.com. Um, wouldn't think there would be much topical variety there... but I am curious as to how far you can run with it... but no... a quick perusal makes me recommend that you pass on reading. There you go.Well, not sure where to go with this now. How about I end this with a list of people that I consider stupid assholes. No that would consume too much space. How about a randomly selected stupid asshole? How's that. Kind of in keeping with the thematic content of this journal. And so, reaching into the drum and pulling out a name we get...Steve Forbes!Oh, that's a good one. Classic case of evolution in action, as in use-it-or-lose-it.

{"title": "Jam Session", "date": "Monday, March 29, 2010", "text": "This past weekend I was down in Indiana. My youngest brother and his friends and acquaintances will, on a roughly quarterly basis, get together to play some music. I happened to be down visiting Saturday night, and was invited to attend.Now, this isn't just your average pathetically aging garage band, a la the movie Slingblade, but rather some serious talent. Would an emphatic adjective drive home the gravity of just how serious? Okay.There was some serious fucking talent there.These guys have been playing in notable local area bands for decades. Some still do. Many, if not all, could easily be studio musicians in Hollywood or Nashville. Yeah, that good. So Saturday night was a great fucking time to be alive. They'd all play a song and the standard joke would be \"Wow, that sounded just like the record!\" Well, more often than not, it sounded better. Could that be from the alcohol? Well, maybe, but I don't think so.Did I participate? Of course!  I mean, I needed a little liquid encouragement at first, but after a while, hearing some of the other bad karaoke singers, I had no problem singing. They don't stand on ceremony, and they certainly aren't music snobs. Don't know the lyrics? That's what print-outs are for! Good voice? Bad voice? Out of tune voice? It didn't matter. The one requirement was that you belt it out with as much feeling and soul as you could muster. And that's what I did. They started me out with something simple. I did John Lennon's part on the song \"Hey Bulldog\", while an old friend of mine did the Paul McCartney accompaniment/harmonizing.Eventually, a few songs later, I did the harmonizing on \"Wish you Were Here\". Then \"Surrender\". My brother sang the lead on that, and did very well indeed. Then finally, I completely messed up Frank Zappa's \"Dirty Love\", just slaughtered the lyrics to the point that the band broke down laughing. So I was done for the evening. No, it wasn't what you think. I wasn't drunk. In fact, I drank, but did not get drunk. The experience alone was intoxicating enough.The highlight of the evening was listening to one musician's wife sing Sara Barielles' \"Love Song\". She had one of the most remarkable voices I've ever heard. It did more than fill the room, it threatened to bust down the walls. She got a big hand from everyone.But you know, everyone did a great job. And had fun. It was a joyful experience,to be immersed in very loud, very good music and to sing yourself hoarse, and help others do the same thing.I wish to do it again."},
{"title": "A Fun Outing", "date": "Thursday, March 25, 2010", "text": "I won't be around tomorrow, so today's entry will have to suffice for Friday Fun. I know that I'm leaning towards a musical theme on Fridays, so perhaps it helps to know that I am listening to rock bands out of Bergen, NO on streaming radio as I write this. Bergen, apparently, has become quite the hip music scene in Norway, which of course would please my mother no end, as some of the family is from here, and thus we are talented by association... I'm going to talk about my day trip to downtown Chicago yesterday. The outing was very much fun indeed! I went with my dear friend Kristyn. Kris used to be my girlfriend, but we aren't anymore. Boyfriend and girlfriend, that is. It's not an unusual thing to stay friends with someone you've been in a more intimate relationship with, but it is for me. And having said that, you might think things were  just a tad, maybe just a tiny bit strained and uncomfortable, but it was just the opposite.I hadn't seen Kris in person for perhaps two months, and it was great to see her. And I think she felt the same way. I think we still have a great amount of affection for each other, and so there was a considerable and mutual delight in seeing each other after such a long time.And Kris is a lot of fun. Smart, gorgeous, and funny. With skin that most movie starlets would kill for. (What, you think I'd go out with women who were dumb, unattractive and humorless? I got high standards). Like I said, she's funny, but she possesses two varieties of funny. One is clever, witty, a fast immediacy funny. And the other is time-bomb funny. And so today, and now I can't think of the specifics, but I remembered something she said yesterday that made me laugh out loud today. And no, I'm not on satellite delay. It was a time-bomb remark.We took the EL down to the Museum of Contemporary Art. We had a long talk on the train down, partly catch-up, and partly just banter. We've always found been good at easy banter, although I think I do more than my share of chatter. (I'd spent the entire week alone at the college, with Spring Break going on, so perhaps I was a bit desperate for someone to talk to).It was one of those days that people would call \"brisk\". Spring has got her learner's permit, but Old Man Winter is not quite ready to give up the wheel. Perhaps Winter was back seat driving that day. Kris and I walked arm in arm towards the lake and the museum with a steady breeze in our faces, and no doubt she was stealing body heat from me as much as anything else. Like I said, it was brisk.Kris, as usual, was smartly dressed and looked good.  I, as usual, was dressed like a slob. I had my summer hat on, sweatshirt, jeans. If you didn't know better, we could have been a Lithuanian couple, because, as I understand it, Lithuanian women always dress sharp when they go out, and Lithuania men do the opposite. Or so I've been told.At any rate, I think you should be given a background to explain our viewing styles at the museum. Kris pretty much likes everything. I like nothing. As a result, I would give perhaps three microseconds of attention to the painting or photograph or sculpture before wanting to move on. Kris prefers to linger. It was a compromise, and one that I was occasionally impatient with.Hopefully, she didn't mind too much.Nevertheless, we did tarry at some works. There was an installation by William Kentridge, seven videos made in a rather grainy cinematic turn of the 19th century style, which, for lack of a better phrase, I found quite charming. I commented to Kris how the videos reminded me of \"A Voyage From the Earth to the Moon\", and perhaps Kentridge was trying to capture the atmosphere of that film. Only later did I realize the installation was titled \"Seven Fragments for Georges Melies\". Oh, duh!So, despite my TV-addled brain, and its two-second attention span, we spent some time watching that, and examining other exhibits. I could relate how I was less than satisfied with a lot of the work, how I considered some of the artists \"hacks\", but I think I'll save my critique of contemporary art for another journal entry.I think we spent about three hours there, going through four programs, one per floor, until finally one of the guards told us the museum was closing. Honestly, and I don't know how Kris felt, but I was about done anyway. We had a nice leisurely stroll on the way back to the EL, looking the classic tourists from suburbia. Fast walkers broke like waves around us, occasionally cast annoyed glances our way.It was rush hour, and the train was packed, so we had to stand. That was a fun adventure being tossed and lurched about in the crowd. I only hit my head twice. Finally, as the train moved further out the crowd thinned, we got to sit down. My lower back was very happy that I got off my feet. I drove us back to her house, where we talked a bit more and I got to play with her dog for a little bit. I like all dogs, but I love her dog. She figured that out from day one. Then I went home. So that was it.You know, I pretty much hermitized myself this winter. Hardly did anything outside of work. And so I experienced no small amount of melancholia after the visit, as I often do when returning from a visit with friends and family down in Indiana.I've always known the difference between being lonely and lonesome. Lonesome is just being alone. Lonely is feeling alone. I've always occupied myself with distractions both trivial and important, and so am often the former, but rarely experience the latter. To be honest, and introspection requires honesty, I guess I'm a lot more lonely than I pretend to be. Well, at least the melancholy was honestly acquired, and I'm consoled by the fact that I'll soon distract myself into a cheerful activity and my mood will improve. And... the somber feelings are tempered with the thought that we do share the warmth of friendship and mutual affection, and that gets you through a lot as well."},

Jesus is freaking out, and asks Peter and the two sons of Zebedee to stand watch with him in the garden of Gethsemane. And when he comes back, he finds that Peter is asleep, and gets pissed and says \"What you couldn't stay awake for one freaking hour?\"Matthew 26:41 \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\"How does a heathen like me know this? Well, duh, I was raised a Lutheran.The parable has nothing to do with what I'm going to talk about. But it has embedded itself, like so many passages, in the public imagination. I think it is now thought to mean that the body is unable to resist the temptations of the flesh. Which, of course, is silly. The mind is the weak part of the equation. Which brings me to the actual point, at least in terms of exercise. Now that Spring has arrived, I've taken up my serious and consistent efforts to counteract the body softness that winter inactivity brings. Which is to say, I was still active during the cold weather, but not nearly so as I am in the warm weather. I really need to do something about that...Yeah, I know I said as  Northern European type I really love Winter and getting out in the cold, but that's only so long as you got someplace warm to go back to and lay about in cozy comfort. I'm a stupid barbarian, but not a masochist.Anyway, I found out pretty quickly that, despite my cold weather efforts, I am once again in terrible shape. I tried a good brisk 3 mile run and, oh man, it was torture. It's going to take at least a month to get back to where I was in November.  But it's not really my body that is out of shape. It's my mind. I've let my brain go soft. I know this because, when I stop, barely able to think about anything except drawing the next breath, within minutes, I'm fine. So, it's my perception of exhaustion that has changed, not any form of physical exhaustion. I've known this for years, which is why I chastise myself all the time for whimping out when I quit.Well, now sports physiologists are backing up my pet theory. Aren't I smart?As you can see here, Dr Sam Marcora of Bangor University has disproved the theory of muscle fatigue, and shown that is your perception of effort that limits your performance.Obviously, there's good reason for this, same reason we have pain. It's a little cushion provided by evolution to keep the body from injuring itself, or rather injuring itself further. Nothing wrong with that, but it does limit us.So, I've got to work on hardening myself mentally. Working on my stick-to-it-iveness, work on my tenacity, pump up my resolve, get my gumption up to snuff.Here's to you doing the same this season, nugget."},

Rest assured, the Greatest Show On Earth will be ongoing in DC, and everyone (on both sides of the aisle and beyond) will be piling out of their little clown cars, and lo a vast amount of stupidity such as can be seen in few other places in the world shall be committed before and for the amusement, bemusment and vast distraction and befuddlement of the American viewing public. And We The People shall be sent the bill for it. Which reminds me...I did income taxes this past weekend. I wait until the last minute because I never get a refund. There's really no point in sending them monies that are mine until the very last second. However, I do do my taxes before hand so there are no surprises.This year there was a surprise! I came across some through the letters and notes that my grandfather had compiled. What do you know? Stashed in there was a income tax form 1040 Grandpa filled out for the year 1920. Are you ready for this?The form and instruction sheet was FOUR FUCKING PAGES LONG!Let me get back to that, but first...In 1920, Grandpa earned $1,023.32 (that is $11,692.32 in 2010 dollars). He got a $1,000 personal exemption, which means his taxable income was $23.32. At a tax rate of 4%, he owed a whopping 93 cents to the government.Now, keep in mind, he's a young man, barely 19, living at home, paying no rent.Slacker.The actual form, for the return was a mere one page in length. It contains 18 line items. Two pages for instructions. One page for Schedule A. The two pages of instructions are a miracle in brevity and clarity. I daresay a six-year-old could read them (not suprising as we would consider the average citizen of 1920 barely literate and feeble-minded today).Hang on, it gets better. Fast forward to another 1040 Grandpa filled out, this one from the year 1942. (For those of you who are not history buffs, the year 1942 counts as one of the darkest periods in our nation's history - outside the Civil War. I'm sorry, but if you think the past two years were tough... you really need to get a grip). The 1040 form is now four pages long. The instruction book is separate. There is one page for tax calculation, containing 33 line items. The other three pages are devoted to Schedules A - J, at basically about a paragraph's size each, and perhaps at most 6 line items per schedule.In 1942, Grandpa earned $10,158.96 (that's $141,536.50 in 2010 dollars, way to go Gramps! or maybe not, he is listed as a Division Chief in a large corporation, so the equivalent VP position today would include a seven figure income with stock options and a really swell health and pension package).His taxable income, after 5 line items of deductions, including personal exemptions, is $6,198.59 ($86,359.96 in 2010 dollars). The normal tax, at 6% comes to $371.92. There is also a surtax of $1,234.29, bringing his total tax to $1,606.21 ($22,378.03 in 2010 dollars). A quick comparison using the 2010 tax tables shows Grandpa would have paid $16,446.00 as head of household.Oh, but with all of the current tax preferences, all the credits, exemptions, exclusions, accelerations, carryovers, and other provisions that are listed in an instruction book the size of a fucking fashion magazine, Grandpa would have paid considerably less. If his accountant was good at hiding things, he'd pay nothing at all!So, what the fuck? Why are things so goddamn convoluted and complicated, and why are some of us taxpayers - *cough*rich assholes*cough* - paying SO LITTLE in taxes?Well, obviously the tax code has all this shit because Congress, or the executive branch, or somebody who lobbied for it, wants to promote certain types of behavior. They wish to influence the American public to do things, such as own homes, have families, invest in savings, provide employer health care, promote corporate investment in R&D and other well-meaning stuff.(And guess what about this well-meaning shit? It Ain't Working).There were, are, obviously, lots of breaks for special interest groups that we should take out, subsidies for rich people, or at least anyone who had enough money and influence to hire an imaginative lawyer and effective lobbyist - which is, yeah, I'd say they're probably rich.So, we lose, how much? The IRS estimates all the fancy tax breaks amount to about a trillion dollars in lost revenue. That's a million million dollars. That's one million stacks of bills with one million dollars in each stack.Is that fair? I don't think so. What would I call that?I'd call that rich people fucking We The People up the ass with a chain mail gauntlet that's embellished with barbed-wire knuckles.Health care reform? Fuck! I'd say it's time for a little tax reform!Bastards should pay!"},

I'd suspected as much, but always hoped it would be the latter half of the 21st century. You know, after I'm dead, or too senile to care.Then comes this disconcerting news as reported in the New York Times (and again, why isn't this an in-depth series of articles in the Wall Street Journal as it would have been in pre-Douchebag* days?): China Drawing High-Tech Research from the US.Mr. Mark Pinto, chief technology officer of Applied Materials is moving himself and his family to Beijing. Applied Materials, one of Silicon Valley's oldest and most prestigious firms, makers of equipment that in turn makes semiconductor chips, solar panels, and flat panel displays, is building its newest and largest research labs in, where? California? Kentucky? Florida? Texas? nope, nope, nope, and nope, try China.They are not alone. \"Companies — and their engineers — are being drawn here more and more as China develops a high-tech economy that increasingly competes directly with the United States\".Says Mr. Pinto “We’re obviously not giving up on the U.S. China needs more electricity. It’s as simple as that.” Ah, simple. OK. More electricity. So we need to move all knowledge and innovation overseas, since we've already moved most of our jobs there. It's simply more convenient for private enterprise to keep costs down. And the savings are passed on to YOU! Better for them. Better for you. See? Simple.I really can't fault Mr. Pinto or call him traitor or anything like that. He's making a smart move. It's the free enterprise way, right? Private enterprise, free market, and all that.Keep in mind, despite all the huge efforts on the part of our obviously socialist and individual-freedom-crushing Big Government to desperately fund high tech research through such communist programs such as DARPA, the Energy Departments ARPA-E program, the Department of Educations efforts to encourage young students to go into engineering and science disciplines, the push to improve our power and data infrastructure, alternative energy solutions, that's just not the right thing to do.We should bow to the inevitable. And the private sector is pointing the way. When it comes to high tech industries, to clean green energy solutions, to anything that smells of progress, all those trillions of dollars in profit that could be made, why American companies are just not interested in it.*Move over Rush Limbaugh, since you're obviously just a muppet with someone's hand up your ass.

I grabbed a 2006 copy of the Wall Street Journal. I spent a good ten minutes browsing the section. Reading the news was like a traveling in a time machine, and throughout the browsing, I'd make exclamations like \"Oh! Wachovia! Don't do it! Watch out Lehman Bros!, Oh shit! Bad move!\"The articles, by the way, were consistently lucid, cogent, perceptive, clear, insightful, and truly objective. And if I look at today's paper? What's the big headline? \"Tiger Woods to return to Masters\". Anything about the Senate version of the finance reform bill? You know, some type of legislation to prevent a half quadrillion (!) shit-storm of bad derivatives from inundating our economy? Well, there's a poorly written, almost-Fox-News dumbed down smarmy little blurb about how Dodd's proposal (paraphrased) \"will be bad for business\".Congratulations, Rupert Murdoch. You have officially (officially because I am proclaiming it) turned the Wall Street Journal into a Shit Rag, and your ass marks are all over it.And the subscriber comment's? Wow. If I ever need to know what the dumbasses of the world think about a topic, that's the first place I'll check. I've given up on it. I'm switching permanently to Financial Times.This is one of those smack-the-forehead-'cause-its-so-frickin'-obvious kind of science articles. Scientists have discovered that you have taste bud cells distributed all over your body. Not just in your tongue and cheeks, but in your esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, lungs, colon, and probably lots of other places.\"Taste, scientists are discovering, is a whole-body sensation. There are taste cells in the stomach, intestine and, evidence suggests, the pancreas, colon and esophagus. These sensory cells are part of an ancient battalion tasked with guiding food choices since long before nutrition labels, Rachael Ray or even agriculture existed. While taste cells in the mouth make snap judgments about what should be let inside, new work suggests that gut taste cells serve as specialized ground forces, charged with preparing the digestive system for the aftermath of the tongue’s decisions.\"I suppose this explains why fresh air tastes sweet. It's not just the tongue, its the lungs as well. I'm not sure if the lungs have the other taste receptors. Let's see, what are they again? Oh right. Sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami. What? Umami. Translates as \"savory\", like the smell that comes from a greasy spoon diner. Mmmm, vaporized beef lard.  It generally is not a conversation item for polite society. One does not discuss what goes on with the gut.  After all, that's where poop lives.Speaking of poop, if there are taste cells down there, why exactly would my colon need to know what my poop tastes like? Does that question gross you out? It really shouldn't, and I suspect it doesn't.Poop is part of life, after all. Having grown up in a semi-rural environment, where a great deal of my friends lived on farms, you get used to poop. That's pretty much what animals do, when they are not eating. And when they eat, that's pretty much the consequence. Why, I've even stepped barefoot in poop. Not my own. Uh, not lately at least.And I'd be willing to bet most people check out their poop after they poop. I know I do. Especially after a really satisfying or extremely big poop. Just what exactly is going on down there? It's a mystery that needs resolution. You can't fault me for being curious.And since we are down there already... why does my anus have a red hot chili pepper pain receptor?  The mouth, okay, I understand, but why remind me of what I et yestiday? And actually, those pain receptors are sensitive to a class of chemicals called vanilloids (yeah, like vanilla), that are aromatics included in spices like bay leaves, cloves, ginger root, and chili peppers. Maybe I ought to experiment with food to see if I can detect anything.Uh, no. Some things are best left to themselves."},
{"title": "This I Believe", "date": "Monday, March 15, 2010", "text": "Sunday mornings, working in the studio, we will listen to Bob Edwards on NPR. Bob has a segment where he will talk with Dan Gediman of This I Believe, Inc., which provides essays on, well, what people believe in. Not surprisingly, the essays tend to be inspirational in nature.The reason I bring this up is this past Sunday, they presented an essay by Robert A Heinlein. Heinlein is considered one of the Big Three science fiction authors (himself, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke, all of whom I cut my teeth on when first exposed to speculative fiction).Heinlein was kind of a strange and persuasive old bird. The one thing I am slightly proud of  was that I managed to survive reading his prose and coming out the other end still able to make up my own mind about things. I remember reading his novel \"Starship Troopers\" ( the film, BTW, I consider a great satire) at the tender age of fourteen - when most children are most easily recruited to use guns without remorse upon practically anyone - and I unhesitatingly and unquestionably bought into his whole weird quasi-fascist shamelessly libertarian-political-screed contained within it. I read it again at the age of eighteen, and realized the political philosophy was completely right-wing batshit crazy whacko. And yet there were elements I could still buy into merely because of the fact that there was an underlying compassion and decency in the author that shown through. And my dealings in life, and my choice of books by then had given me the observation that Utopian Social Engineering by people with good intentions allows all sorts of terrible things to happen.I often think that the early injection of Heinlein made me immune to Ayn Rand when I finally read - and dismissed - her. Heinlein's faith in humanity shed light on the frighteningly and poisonously psychotic personality that was Rand, and is, by extension, her fans: people who aren't particularly with it, aren't particularly smart, but consider themselves better than others, feel under-appreciated, and who will definitely, under the right circumstances, climb a clock tower with a loaded rifle. She really was a full-on psychopath with zero understanding of not only human behavior, but of the underlying tenets of the United States, and the basic premise of capitalism. I have a deep and abiding suspicion of anyone that has bought into her horseshit. As a result, to paraphrase, of all people, Martin Goerring, when I hear the word \"Libertarian\", I reach for my revolver. Talk about totalitarians masquerading as, well, in the original sense of the word, libertarians, that's the Libertarians. Give them a chance at governing this country, and I guarantee Death Camps in Wyoming and Presidents-For-Life before their term is up.Anyways, Heinlein's essay dealt with what he saw as the essential decency of human beings, and can be read here. I'd like to provide a short excerpt to comment upon:\"I am proud to be a human being. I believe that we have come this far by the skin of our teeth, that we always make it just by the skin of our teeth --but that we will always make it....survive....endure. I believe that this hairless embryo with the aching, oversize brain case and the opposable thumb, this animal barely up from the apes, will endure --will endure longer than his home planet, will spread out to the other planets, to the stars, and beyond, carrying with him his honesty, his insatiable curiosity, his unlimited courage --and his noble essential decency\".I appreciate the sentiment I really do. I even, foolish optimist that I am, buy into the notion that we will make it to the stars someday, but I am slightly puzzled as to WHY I believe this. I recognize the arrogance, the conceit embedded in these remarks, and yet, I think he is right. People are basically decent, and it is only the circumstance that creates evil.I also recognize that there is no guarantee that progress in human society is inevitably toward a more decent future, that our \"angels of our better nature\" will always prevail. We (meaning Americans) certainly don't have the track record, either as a nation or as a world.  And yet, I feel, big picture wise, that perhaps 5,000 or 10,000 years from now, when things are perhaps better for everyone, and we as a people, in some strange Bill and Ted society are \"being excellent to each other\", will look at the history of the American nation and will say \"Well, at least they tried to live up to their principles. We give 'em a D in performance, a C for effort, but an A for the attempt\"."},

{"title": "Pound for pound...", "date": "Thursday, March 11, 2010", "text": "...of all the art forms, music is the best. Obviously, I've become completely distracted with music as of late. One thing I've noticed, after listening and selecting tunes to learn on the guitar, is that, despite what they say about music doing good things for your brain, I've noticed quite the opposite. I can't seem to formulate a decent sentence, let alone compose a decent paragraph, without a huge amount of effort. Something that didn't seem to happen a week or so ago.Now, maybe it is because I normally do not pay too much attention to music. It's just background noise, or occasionally a pleasant enough sound track for an activity, but rarely does it make me pause from what I'm doing and take notice. Except, of course, when I find it incredibly annoying.Since I've been undergoing the pandora experiment, where I have to give a thumbs up or down to a piece of rock music that it plays, I've noticed I'm increasingly distracted by it. It's easy enough to do a thumbs down. If I hate a song, and it is interesting how often I really do hate a song, it takes no effort to identify it.Ah, but to decide if I like a song, that takes a great deal of concentration. I'm not quite sure how to quantify it either. And it is strange, as I've mentioned, I do have some musical training. I even took a music theory class at one time. So I do have some small ability at analysis. But to express why you like something, well, I guess it is like what St. Augustine said about time: \"I know what it is, until you ask me to define it\". Well, let's what pandora (consistently) says what I like about the songs it selects that I like:1) a vocal-centric aesthetic 2) a subtle use of harmony3) punk influence4) rock influence5) mild rhythmic syncopationWell, I'd agree with 1) and 2). Say what you like or don't like about civilization, the social and technological advances of the past 10,000 years have allowed us to create more and varied music than ever we had with, say, deer sinew, hide, and bone. But the constant attractor throughout all that time has been the human voice. Instrumental tunes are fine adn all that, but nothing grabs my attention like a beautiful voice. And two or more voices, in harmony, is even better.As to 3), I've never considered myself much of a punk rocker fan, but I do like some raw high energy in my music. So, throw 4) and 5) in was well.But that's not all there is. I know there is something more. There's an orbit, an ellipse, a locus, a strange attractor, that I'm not identifying and pandora is not doing a good job of targeting.I guess what they say about porn is true of everything. \"I know it when I see it\"."},

And cynical and judgmental\" (that's me paraphrasing, as she's far too tactful to say it).Well, what can I say? There's not much to say about the stupidity charge. I think I've always said, or at least am saying now, that I don't think intelligence actually exists. Intelligence is like cold. It doesn't really exist except as a word. There is something, like lack of heat, which does exist. There is no such thing as intelligence. There is such a thing as a lack of stupidity. To say that I am rarely lacking is not entirely honest. So I got no problem with that.I will say that the phrase \"judgmental\", in the current negative context that it enjoys is a descriptive term, I have no problem with either. As the ancient Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu once said \"A man can no more not judge than a fish can not swim\". The cynicism charge I don't have a problem with either, in that I do indeed proceed from a starting position of taking things at their worst, and then modifying it from there.It's a good practical stance, as I am rarely disappointed. But I do get irritated with the implied suggestion that I just reject things out of hand. These qualities, in our modern environment, infer such a cavalier behavior.Thats' simply not true. I've usually given the matter considerable thought, ruminated on the subjects quite a bit, before finally deciding that such and such a thing (often contrary to popular opinion and conventional wisdom) is utter horseshit.And I can back it up with a good argument as well (again not the current disparaging coloration, but rather a fairly sound and logical set of reasons).Yeah, well, back to work."},
{"title": "An Enormous Waste of Time", "date": "Friday, March 5, 2010", "text": "I haven't been able to add to this online journal since last week. And since I'm trying to remain consistent with my self-imposed rules, I can't write about anything serious today. Although the subject of today's entry - music - is deathly serious, my treatment of it this past week has not been so. Aside from the usual inconveniences of a real job, I've been sucked into the musical world, on at least two simultaneous fronts, and perhaps more.The first facet of this particular excursion crystallized out of a trip back to Indiana. While helping a friend of my brother's move shit, we discovered an acoustic guitar. My brother, who is an excellent base player, noodled with it for a bit. As he was doing so, I expressed my regret at never having learned guitar. My brother's friend, upon hearing this, suggested that I borrow the guitar for a month. If, at the end of that time, I could play the guitar, I could keep it. We've not yet completely determined what \"play\" means in playing a guitar, but I've got to assume it has to be more than mere monkey strumming. In other words, I can't just learn three chords and find an appropriate cadre of songs to ape. And so, I'm learning all the chords right now, putting in at least an hour an evening. My left hands hurts quite a bit once I'm done.It should be known that I do come from a musical family. All of us, at one point or another, were trained on some kind of instrument, and, when the stars and planets are properly aligned, we four brothers can produce some pretty spectacular and dense harmonies with our not entirely terrible voices. The weird thing about learning the guitar for me is, having a very brief and futile set of lessons on the piano, I visualize notes and chords on a keyboard, rather than a guitar tab. Thus, learning a new chord is not unlike translating a phrase from English into Spanish, and then into French and back again.The second facet of this excursion involves looking for songs on the internet - and fooling around with the websites lastfm and pandora. Both are interesting and frustrating in their own way. I think, in a little experiment I'm doing, that I'm slowly forcing pandora into a narrow little world of indecision, trying to figure out what my personal tastes are, as I refuse to identify what songs I like, but am quite liberal in choosing songs I don't like. That's really not that different from the real world actually. When people ask my what kind of music I like, I'll often tell them it's easier to list what I don't like.As to lastfm, I'm just using it more to explore genres than anything else. For some strange reason, I seem temporarilly drawn to psychobilly. If I do (rarely) find a song I like, I head over to youtube to see what else the group has to offer. This search strategy is actually only slightly better than the random search for CDs I use at my local library, which, as you might guess, has pretty dismal success results. Nevertheless, it is all an enormous waste of time.In closing, here are two little ditties that I can comedy dance to in a dorky robot fashion. You might want to loosen up a bit and, when you are alone at least, with no one watching, try them out. (The first link, by the way, is Yellow Magic Orchestra's electric-chunky synthopop version of Martin Denny's Firecracker. Denny, godfather of exotica music, based his version on the traditional japanese song \"Sayonara\". Denny also performed a song called \"Quiet Village\", portions of which were used as an intro to the theme song of Peewee Herman's Tv show \"Peewee's Playhouse\". Funny how things are connected). Oh, and one more to irritate the shit out of you, or not.No? How about this one?"},

I'll drop that until Monday. It's a day for frivolity today. And random thoughts.1) Woke up at dawn. Looked out the window, and with the sun shining and the new fallen snow, everything looked like a Gingerbread village. Wow. I'm in a good mood! Won't last though...  2) ...told you it wouldn't last. Between needy and helpless students lined outside my office door looking for answers, and cleaning up the mess from the night before, things went south fast. Plus, I get to the college and today is the day to check on whether I was accepted into a local show. I was rejected. And worse, two people I know who do not even have a fraction of the talent that I have got in. Well, I checked out the website of the artist juror who selected the work. His work sucks a big old turd! So, naturally he does not have the good taste required to appreciate me. Sour grapes? Of course! My coping mechanism and I'll get over it. And see? I'm already in a good mood again, so...3) Last night, my student aide Caitlin, turned me on to a phenom called flash mob. As she constantly reminds me, I am so behind the times. But, hey, at least I'm staying young by having all these needy and helpless youngsters around me who clue me in to these things. So, how did they all get together and choreograph this? It's fun to watch because let's face it, Life is no high school musical. And I've got to wonder if this could be more useful than performance art? What if something like this could be used for disaster relief? Well, anyway...4) Last night during the ceramics class, we put on CDs of the Beatles, which, in a kind of a flash mob fashion, turned into a singalong. I think I started it. I've not the greatest voice in the world, but I can sing in tune, and fairly loud if required. Soon enough, everyone was singing. And everyone did seem to be happy by the end of night. that was fun. But today...5) Well, today, I have to reclaim clay. Which means I'll be up to my elbows in wet mud, throwing muck into a mixer, adding dry powder to reconstitute the texture so that the kids can have clay to throw pots and such. The clay, it turns out, needs to age. It releases kind of a faint stink, a sulfury smell which is all the little archea doing their thing. They act as a consortium, manufacturing a biofilm which is a slime that makes the clay nice and creamy. I really don't mind doing this, but after a few hours my arms and hands ache from moving a few tons around and packing the reclaimed clay into plastic bags. But, hey, it's better than living out of a grocery cart and sleeping outdoors, so I can't complain. In fact...6) I'll end this with: I've really nothing major to complain about today. Hope the same is with you. Enjoy!"},

Let's just cut through all my bullshit and get to the point.FACT: People's world views affect how they receive facts. Information is personal.  Information that does not sit well within your system of beliefs is likely to be rejected. Information that is in line is likely to be accepted. Seems fairly obvious. Are we in agreement so far? If so, then: CONSEQUENCE: How often is false information accepted? (And here, I designate false information as demonstrably false, i.e. empirically false, e.g. beyond opinion, beyond suspicion, beyond reasonable doubt, into the realm of science). Answer: as often as your system of beliefs can stand the strain. There are limits to credulity, you know. You may believe in an Almighty, but how far are you willing to go, with both the conceptual assumptions and narratives? Is your Almighty ineffable and immaterial? If so, does He or She or It occupy a spiritual realm separate from material existence? If so, how populous is this realm? Are you willing to believe in gnomes? Goblins? Fairies? How ridiculous does the creature have to get before you don't believe in them? And can you reliably draw a parting line? Etc.(Lest you think I am picking on spiritual types as the more credulous and naive --and I am, because ultimately this is the frickin' point-- let's not forget that materialism is itself a metaphysic whose assumptions are subject to investigation. The Catholic Encyclopedia suggests that materialists deny the existence of God and the soul. But if you looked at yesterday's journal entry, you can see this ain't necessarily so. For better criticisms, see Immanuel Kant, or, to some extent David Hume, or George Berkeley. Although I should warn you. These guys are seriously boring motherfuckers, and philosophy is, ultimately a giant fucking waste of time).ELSE ALTERNATELY: Congratulations. You have absolutely not a shred of bias or bigotry in that vacuum fresh little mind of yours. You are either a newborn (unlikely, as they have biases, like prefering pretty faces over ugly ones), or you are an idiot, like the Peter Seller's character Chance in \"Being There\". So, no, there is no Else Alternately. Back to... Consequences!Here's something. I've run across people who get all excited about things like numerology, or sacred geometry, or even that things like the Golden Ratio, the Golden Mean, the Fibonacci sequence, and basically they swoon over the idea that the universe is founded upon mathematics. The underlying assumption here is that Number is real. Number has a separate, independent, and perhaps transcendental existence from our reality. Or as the mathematician G.H. Hardy once put it, mathematics - numbers - would exist even if our universe did not.Bullshit.  I could give you the standard philosophical objections to this, but it's boring and silly. The most fanatical of mathematical platonists, probably of all time, was Kurt Godel. Godel insisted that not only was the Realm of Number real, but an internal sense called Mathematical Intuition existed that allowed us to tap into this realm. Again, bullshit.  And I'll tell you why I think it's all bullshit tomorrow. But I've run out of time, once again.Suffice to say, the consequences of accepting this world view are pretty dire, and can in more cases  than not result in some dangerously stupid decisions about what to do in the world."},
{"title": "Not Even Wrong - Part 2", "date": "Tuesday, February 23, 2010", "text": "The Not Even Wrong series got off to a shaky start. Let's see if we can recover some before we go forward. Yesterday I was to Call Bullshit on mathematical platonism. Well, I think I'll need to move along several tangents to get there. So hang on a sec'. A 2009 Gallup poll found that 44% of Americans believe that God created human beings in their present form within the past 10,000 years. Many of them also think the human body is perfectly designed.My response to that is... Wow. That Is Really Fucked Up. And Americans wonder why our nation is in decline.I think anyone beyond the age of eight, or who uses possibly more than a third of their (God given?) frontal lobes, has to realize that it requires several convoluted explanations that just get stupider and stupider as they go along to get to the Flintstone Theory.God created Man in His own image? Does God have a prostate? Well, God is a really old guy, so that sucker must have swelled up to the size of Wyoming by now!Okay, enough funnin' around. The reason I brought up the Gallup poll result was threefold. 1) In order to talk about mathematical platonism, we need to talk about platonism. In order to talk about platonism, we need to talk about perfection. And possibly the divine. Or at least some realm in which perfection exists, which is what Plato was talking about. The realm of God, or the Gods.2) We need to mention that Plato was Class II Stupid: in other words, ignorant (not, you know, Class IV Stupid: intentionally, willfully, and dangerously stupid like 44% of Americans). He, like Aristotle, or Socrates, or others before our time, was not in possession of facts that we have today.3) My reaction is a subjective one. But our judgements tend to categories ranging along a spectrum of (if we are honest with ourselves) merely personal opinion to objective fact. Its a question of doubt. As such, I can Call Bullshit on something recognizing that it is merely my personal opinion, and that you might think otherwise (in other words, I have a doubt), to I have a personal opinion which I suspect is also an objective fact (I have only a small doubt), to I strongly consider my opinion to be an objective fact (I have no doubt).  Please note, faith is not the polar opposite of doubt. I do not require faith to have no doubts.So, let's say I consider the idea that \"there is no God\" an objective fact. I am under a burden of proof, of empirical evidentiary duty to back up this statement.Why? Some people (atheists, but, you know, they already have a lot of fucked up problems, starting with an undeserved opinion that they are somehow smarter than other people) will try to cop out and say that I am making a negative statement (There is No God), and do not need to prove a negative. Oh, Bullshit. One of the fundamental principles of logic is the principle of Noncontradiction (something cannot be both true and false). The principle is clearly a negative statement, and is easily proved. (I should note that my opinions about the existence of God, or the logically distinct and independent question of the existence of a human soul, is this: I really don't give a crap).So, Oops! Did you read carefully bakc there a little while back? I said... the IDEA that \"there is.. \" etc. The concept. Why did I say that? Because any honest person will recognize that the objective fact regarding existence or nonexistence of a deity is not only not provable through logic or reason, we can neither establish it through empirical evidence. In other words, it is not only philosophically unsustainable, it is unscientific because it is not falsifiable.(A dorky guy named Richard Dawkins dishonestly tried to say otherwise in his book \"The God Delusion\". Dawkins is, quite frankly and in my opinion, a douchebag. But that's for another time. Maybe).So, all we got to talk about is the idea of something. Because it is an abstraction. If you want to show me an abstraction, that is outside of your head... hey, have fun with that. More later tomorrow, hopefully. I gots to go do some work out here in the real world."},
{"title": "Not Even Wrong", "date": "Monday, February 22, 2010", "text": "I've read more than my fair share of general science books. I recognize them for what they are - a general summary of scientific knowledge of whatever field they cover. I recognize that there are people out there that have a hard time distinguishing between a general summary of conditional, provisional collection of facts and theories and unquestioned dogma. I say this because I have, over time, modified my thinking about certain books which went from (a near) acceptance of the contents of the book as (almost) unquestioned dogma, to, in some cases, a complete rejection of the contents of the book.I think perhaps one of the more sane approaches I've read was by a cosmologist that reviewed the evidence for the Big Bang theory. The first thing he made clear was that there was no suggestion that a Big Bang actually occurred (despite what most people think). Rather, the evidence to date suggested that if you go back far enough in time (some 13.7 billion years, give or take) conditions get very, very crowded, matter gets hotter and denser, and the universe starts to look like it exploded at some time zero. Not, and this is important, that there was a big huge bang that started it all. But someone could surmise, from the evidence, that it looks like maybe a big huge bang occurred way back when.There's a huge difference in the two statements.The first statement (the evidence suggests...) sets initial limits on knowledge. The second (a big bang happened) sets initial limits on correctness - what knowledge is allowed and what is not.This week, I'm going to try to cover belief. I'm going to try cover my increasing discomfort with what is allowed and what is not. What is considered \"settled\" knowledge and what is still open to interpretation or challenge.I think, and will always think, that the scientific endeavor is the best set of skills we as a species have developed for accumulating and evaluating knowledge. It may often fail to describe what, in reality, something is, but it works quite well at helping determine what things are not. In short, it is our best tool when it time to Call Bullshit on something.I think there are far too many people who feel that, since the science is in the science book, that all the facts and theories are now settled. There's no reason to question things. And they think this is the way Science works. \"They got that figured out and That's That and now the Science Types are moving on to the next question\".This is not to suggest that Science is evolving into a religion. The very nature of the activities makes this impossible, because, quite frankly, theories have to fit the facts. Facts come from Nature. And Nature, like it or not, keeps us honest. Religion can make up any old silly thing and call it true.And this is not to suggest that some things are not settled. There are lots of things are just plain wrong. There are things we can call Bullshit on. How do we know? The empirical evidence says so. (Nature keeps us honest).But I am worried that I'm starting to see a form of fundamentalism develop. I'm worried that there are some brittle thinkers that are popularizers of science who perhaps should instead just shut the fuck up. And maybe I'm one of them.But, I will attempt to explore science and tradition and faith and belief in a non-boring manner throughout the week.So, tomorrow, I think I  will talk about I lost my faith in Number, and why numbers are not real, and why I think mathematical platonism is Bullshit."},
{"title": "\"Lonely Already\"", "date": "Friday, February 19, 2010", "text": "Hey, it's been a whole week since my last journal entry. Well, I been busy. Aside from the occasional inconvenience of doing my regular job, I've been putting the finishing touches on the latest sculpture, and documenting it. Hey, I figured I'd also update my profile image with something a bit more sophisticated. I chose the image in keeping with the slightly dark nature of my personality. But, if I ever decide to run for Congress, I can use the above picture, which makes me look like obvious presidential material... in  Latvia.Hopeful, dreamy, distinguished, looking towards the Future, which is obviously Stage Left, giving me just the right touch of wholesomeness and humility such that, uh, the electorate will ignore my arrest record on drug and unregistered weapons charges. But enough about that. I'd rather talk about the latest sculpture. It's a cabinet. And there's a story behind it.About a year and a half ago, I helped a friend of mine, Lance Friedman, through a minor trouble. (Lance operates a glassblowing studio called Shatter Glass Group, LLC, the oldest glass studio in Chicago. You can see his work here. And, what do you know, he has a online journal as well. I didn't know that).  Lance's power had gone out, and his glass furnace was losing temperature. This furnace is a pot furnace, meaning the molten glass is contained in a large crucible within it. If the glass cools too much, it cracks the pot. If that happened, Lance would have been, well, temporarily fucked, in that he needs a new pot and has to clean out the furnace with a jackhammer.So, he calls me to unload the glass into 55 gallon drums filled with water, before it gets too cold. Which I do, seeing as he is my friend. Once we were done, he offered to pay me for my time and troubles. Greedy little guy that I am, seizing the opportunity, I simply asked for the glass. And so I ended up with about 50 pounds of some really nice casting glass.Okay, fast forward about six months. The glass is sitting in plastic buckets at the college, and I have done jack squat with them, because I have zero ideas what to do with it. None. Finally, I get a break. There's an old guy in the sculpture class named Jim, who wishes to have a mold made of his face so that he can make several copies in clay for a project. I assist him in making a plaster mold in exchange for a few copies of his face. I make the copies in wax.About six months after that, during the Winter break, the kilns become available, and I am able to cast in glass the wax faces. (I need the kilns for three weeks in order to do this. Casting thick glass takes a long time to anneal).So now, I have the two faces. I actually know what I want to do with them. I follow my normal materials heuristic, and create bronze frames to hold the glass, and then a wood cabinet to hold the glass and bronze.I even have a theme planned out in advance. And here I have to digress for just a slight moment.I've always liked glass, but only certain kinds of glass. I've never been a big fan of shiny, but cast and etched glass I like very much. I like the matte surface and texture. I like the subdued grey colors of rough clear cast glass. It reminds me of fog, I suppose. And storm-tossed seas. And glaciers. And overcast days. Huh, must be the Northern European aesthetic in me.So, the minute I cast the faces, I says to myself  \"These guys are ghosts\". Not that I believe in ghosts, but not believing in something has never stopped me from using it as a theme, or concept, or mood creator. So, a ghost box is what I have to make.Here's the finished piece. It's called \"Lonely Already\". To me, its sad and funny. Poor, trapped ghosts, probably recently deceased, already unhappy and wanting company to while away eternity, or at least that part of it they have to spend in the box. Enjoy."},

The glass is glass, and the fabric is fabric.Not much else to say about it. I suppose it could be a statement about artificial insemination? As usual, I had no conceptual thoughts behind the construction of the piece. I was just going for something that just looked cool. Oh, yeah, right.

Skies are close down to the ground, claustrophobic, and a solid granite grey. The snowflakes are big huge fluffy fat boys raining down. It took me about ten minutes to remove the snow from my car. The drive in to the college sucked, and I nearly took a spill on the sidewalk.I could not be happier.Winter really is my time of the year. The darker and gloomier and colder it gets, the perkier I am. I suppose if it ever got down to Absolute Zero, you'd find a huge shit-eating grin on my frozen mug. Winter is when I thrive. I know it is sick and perverse. I know it is barbarous. I can only chalk it up to my loony Scandi-hoovian ancestors, the ones who, as the glaciers retreated, were pioneering a mere foot or two behind the receding ice. The ones who complained a lot died off. The ones who enjoyed it not only survived, but thrived.It is a pity I live in flat land. I'd love to go skiing right now. Haven't skied in a good 20 years and I know I'd break my ass somehow, but I desperately want to do it.Speaking of which, I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm not a sports fan. I really don't like sports all that much. Some would say that's un-American, and not very healthy.Oh, I watch sports. Occasionally. Briefly. But I've never gotten into the glued-to-the-tube sitting in the La-Z-Boy with a Stadium Buddy catheter wrap on my penis to avoid bathroom breaks. I'm just not that into watching them. If you want me to take a nap, put some sports on the TV.I can, like a lot of American guys, bluff my way through a conversation about sports. There is, because of just the usual media inundation, a minimum of absorption about what's going on in the sports world. But I can't get passionate about it. It took me quite some time to realize that it was OK not to excel at a sport and yet still enjoy playing it. I blame the media for this. And since most people actually suck at playing sports, I am several steps ahead, since I 1) have always been in good shape, 2) have always been naturally athletic, 3) know, not wishing to brag, that I possess a not inconsiderable degree of physical courage, and therefore am unafraid of injuries, 4) am, knock on wood, pretty much immune to major injury, and 5) once I warm up, am actually not half bad at sports and enjoy the feeling immensely.It turns out, even for my age, for example, that I can throw a football as well pro quarterbacks, at least in terms of distance. Oh, you want the ball aimed at something? That's a different story. Same with golf. How far do you want that ball to go? Oh, you want me to put it on the fairway?Same with tennis. I can get that little fuzzy ball moving at about the speed of sound. Oh, you want it to be in bounds? Baseball. Over the plate? Basketball? Throwing the ball the length of the court doesn't count for anything? It has to go though that hoop?And I love hurtling my body through space and colliding it into things. It's a great sensation. It's probably why I loved playing football. I know it's why I love to ski. I think I actually spend more time wiping out than I do going downhill. So, come to think of it, I guess I do like sports. But playing. Not watching.That's probably not very American. But I guess its healthy."},
{"title": "Two Odd Sensory Things", "date": "Monday, February 8, 2010", "text": "Not much time for a journal entry today. Two weird items come to mind. Have you noticed how food combinations, or taste or smell combinations work out so well, or don't? Chicken and broccoli, or pork and corn, are obvious combinations. They go well together. I believe there is a scene in the movie Ratatouille, where a rat turns out to be a great chef, where they discuss this combination of tastes. I like the taste of Wrigley's Winterfresh. The vending machine in the hall by the studio ran out, so I got Spearmint, a sturdy and reliable companion gum. Later, Winterfresh was back. I happened to be chewing a piece of Spearmint when I bought a pack, and popped a stick of  Winterfresh in my mouth and the taste combination was... not good. It tasted like the way a urinal cake smells. Not good at all.The second thing is I experienced synesthesia. That's where your sense get mixed up. Like you see or feel music, or numbers and letters can be certain colors? Well, I'm sitting at lunch today, and the person across the table from me has some orange jello. I am just kind of thinking about nothing, just staring at the orange jello, mind a complete blank, and I take a sip of my chocolate milk. Well, it tastes like orange juice.I spit the mouthful of chocolate milk out, you know, the classic spray, and pretty much ruining the lunch experience of the person across from me. I apologized and explained what happened, but got nowhere with the explanation, or the apology.And those are my two weird things today."},
{"title": "It is, but it isn't", "date": "Friday, February 5, 2010", "text": "Ellen Abbott and I did an art trade about a month ago. Both of us think they got the better end of the deal. That makes it a good trade. Win/win, in a nonzero sum game. Would that everything else turned out as such.The funny thing about the way I work is, it is not unlike creating a picture, then saying \"I've got the perfect living room for this\". And then building a house around the picture. Admittedly, a rather strange and backward way to do things, but hey, there you go. So it was with Ellen's piece. I started out with a cast glass piece, and said \"I know just the right way to present this\". And this is what I am doing right now. I created two cast glass pieces. I am now building a cabinet for them. The facilities here at Harper College are really, all things considered, first rate. No four-year Illinois college has anything close to them. The woodshop, all by itself, has more equipment than most university studios. Granted, the kids have abused the place, but it is something I can work around. \"Adapt, improvise, overcome\", the Marine Corps credo, is mine as well. In building the cabinet, I usually start out with a design, with a plan. As Dwight Eisenhower said, \"Planning is essential. But all plans are useless\". This seeming paradox is only so if you have never built anything, otherwise it makes perfect sense. My cabinet design usually changes after the first piece of wood is cut. Usually because I fuck up, and cannot afford to buy more wood. Dimensions change, or the plan is seen as in one aspect, unworkable.It's Fun. But it isn't.I'm looking at my piece of drawing paper with my instructions and admonitions on it. There are some cryptic phrases on there, things that made sense at the time. \"Floor is 1 1/4 inches up from bottom, sides, front and back!\" Exclamation point, which meant it must have been important. I honestly have no clue about it. There are dimensions of the cabinet and stand on the paper, as well as perspective drawings, exploding diagrams, and orthographic projections of the piece. Quite a lot for a glorified box! And then there are directions to myself:Dill, peg, and glue front frameBuy hardware for doorsCut panels, fit and glue back frameCut front and back panels to match (H+W)Cut side height to match front and backCut bottom to match length of front and backCut sides and bottom width to matchDrill, peg, and glue bottom, side, front, backDrill inside top holes to match side, front and back, pegRoute out top panel, ogive Buy birch panel (the good stuff)Glue bottom of standCut keyhole slots in back of cabinetBuy brass angle brackets to secure stand to cabinetBuy magnetic stops for doorsStain doors, cabinet, top, standVarnish front of doorsPatina bronze frame Glue up doors (with bronze and glass inside)Install lightBuy light firstInstall doorsGlue on topThe list probably makes little sense to you. There are some items, in retrospect, that barely make sense to me. And it is nice to see that past-self-Johnny takes no chances, assumes future-self-Johnny is some kind of slack-jawed meat-slapper, and so throws in reminders like the parenthetical one in Item 19, or hopes he reads Item 21.Already I have a bit of nostalgia about this cabinet, even though I am still only on Item 11.It was no fun. But it was."},
{"title": "The Infinite Elsewhen", "date": "Wednesday, February 3, 2010", "text": "I've always enjoyed reading science fiction and fantasy. For a time, that is about all I read. Eventually, thankfully, my brain matured and my interests broadened. But, visiting the library, I will still occasionally snag a book out of the New Purchases section of  the good old comfort food of SF&F packaged in a lurid jacket. About a year ago, I came across an author of a short story in a Best Of Anthology named Kage Baker. Her universe was intriguing, and I ended up reading a collection of her short stories and one novel. Can't remember the name of the books, but since Kage Baker just recently died from cancer, there will be no more.The stories were time travel stories, but with her Kage's unique twist. A corporation in the 24th century had developed time travel. Named Dr. Zeus, Inc. (or Jovian Integrated Systems), the company offered tourist packages into the past, and also ran a very nice sideline of sequestering treasures and artifacts of the past for retrieval in the future. This exploitative archival portion of the business was far from altruistic. These priceless objects, thought to be lost to the past, brought a hefty profit to the company's bottom line.Like any good universe builder, Kage had rules.Rule#1 (always a good rule for time travel stories): You Can't Change The Past. Caesar, Lincoln, Kennedy are always assassinated. The Titanic always sinks. The Space Shuttles always blow up. This one simple rule avoids all of the paradoxes inherent in time travel, like the Grandfather Paradox. (Time traveller goes back in time and kills his grandpa. But if grandpa is dead, the time traveller never exists. If he never exists, he cannot kill his grandpa).The nice dramatic consequence of Rule#1 is that a time traveller can find loopholes around fixed past events. For example, they could smuggle gold off the Titanic before it sinks. Or steal books from the Library of Alexandria before it burns.  The clunky consequence of Rule#1 is that if a time traveller interferes in past events (pretty unavoidable by just being there), then they were supposed to interfere. So, if a time traveller killed his grandpa by mistake, it will turn out that grandma had slept with someone else who was his (or her) real grandpa. Kind of a safe, pat way to go about things, I admit.Rule#2: You Can Only Travel Into The Past. You would think that the dangerous part of time travel would be changing the past. But since Rule #1 above takes care of that, there should be no worries. But forbidding travel into the future avoids the complication of travellers mucking about with their own lives, by gaining unfair advantage, perhaps second guessing themselves, or even worse, changing their own lives to avoid some future unpleasantness. But that would, in a sense, from their future self's sense, involve changing their own past, which is not allowed.Other than these two rules, anything goes. And it leaves quite a bit of wiggle room. As you would expect, a time travelling corporation, not being able to change the past, can still influence people and events to their not inconsiderable advantage. As you would expect, such a corporation, by the time the 24th century rolls around, pretty much has control of everything.And so it was in Kage's universe. By the time the 24th century rolls around, events and opinions have been manipulated so that, well, we are all a lot more docile and easy to manage than, say , cave people. Everyone is a vegetarian. Most pleasures, both licit and illicit, have been outlawed. All media outlets and sources of information, for that matter any source of anything, are controlled and owned by The Company. Humanity has been reduced to soft, pampered, docile, scared little animals - kind of like the present day US of A.So, it was a fun but creepy universe. Thanks, Kage. I enjoyed it."},

He would forget words.Sometimes, we'd be working with him out in the garage, and he'd start out \"Hand me the uh - the...\" and then his voice would trail off.He'd be completely flummoxed, not able to conjure up the word. It would not even be within the confines of his throat, let alone the tip of his tongue.We, his sons, all had our various coping strategies for this eventuality.The eldest, Son #1, would grab the last tool used and display it in front of him. \"No, the uh- the uh-\".I, Son #2, would ask him to pantomime what he wanted. \"Two syllables\" \"Sounds like\". Which, of course, would just piss him off.Son #3 would stand in stony silence for a brief moment, perhaps gathering strength, and then would rapid fire off the names of every tool in sight. \"No, the uh-\" No! The uh -\" \"NO! NO!\"Son #4, the baby, would treat it like a game of twenty questions. \"Is it used on wood?\" \"Does it have a green plastic handle?\" Considering that twenty binary (answerable as yes or no) questions can cover about a million objects (220 = 1,048,576), this strategy might not have been the most time-conservative. Perhaps he should have played Password, or $20,000 Pyramid, with our father.Sometimes, in triumph, the name would explode out of him \"- the HAMMER!\". Most times, he, like me, being a Taurus, simply could not surrender, and would stubbornly struggle, would wrestle his own brain, and eventually lose. It was both humorous and sad, heroic and pathetic, to watch. And we, his sons, had no choice but to await the outcome, whatever it was.And now I know that this trait is genetic, as I am having trouble with words. Just today, I could not, for the life of me, think of the word \"discrimination\".Generally, art is about mixing and matching and combining, and not so much about finding the absolutely right mix or match or combination. I could be wrong. There is a certain amount of discrimination involved.Take the sample space for all diatonic melodies. (The white keys on a piano). If we choose a minimum of eight notes to name the tune, and we use the diatonic scale (Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do), then the sample space* of all melodies consists of all combinations of seven tones in eight notes.In other words, Melody #1 might be just the note A repeated eight times (Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do). Melody #14 might be (Do-do-do-do-do-do-re-ti). Got the idea? Since the last \"Do\" is just an octave higher than the first \"Do\", we have seven tones to play with in eight note combinations, and so the total number of elements in the sample space of white-piano-key melodies is 78 = 5,764,801.Now, most of these melodies would be kind of boring. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'd have to commit serious bodily harm on and about your person if you whistled Melody #1 for very long. So, let's figure we can drop more than half - in fact, let's say three-quarters - of the melodies as something that will never make the Top 40. We are still left with around 1,921,600 melodies. I wonder how many we've heard?And in visual arts, I suspect there is even more leniency. How far could Jackson Pollock's hand have strayed when dribbling paint, before one action painting became uniquely different from another one? A quick calculation suggests.... well, a very large number.But writing? Writing is hard. Finding the right word, the right phrase, is the difference between a master work and mediocrity. Musicians, and visual artists, I think, have an easier time of it. Oh, there are times when the right chord, the right rhythm can make all the difference in a piece. And pound for pound, since there is nothing that can evoke an emotion better than music, I'd be willing to bet that a change of one note can ruin the incantation. But I don't think there is an art form whose whole is more sensitive to a change in parts than literature.It's a good thing I'm not a writer. *A sample space is simply all possible unique outcomes of a something. So, for example, the roll of the dice contains a 6 x 6 sample space of outcomes (1,1), (1,2) ...(6,6)), or 36 elements. Or the sample space of possible chess moves is a number so large (10120, give or take) it makes the total number of atoms in the visible universe (1075, give or take) seem small. However, since most chess moves are actually dumb moves to make, the number of smart chess moves is actually very small - small enough for our relatively (compared to the universe) tiny brains to remember."},
{"title": "The Weakest of all the Human Race", "date": "Sunday, January 31, 2010", "text": "Few people have ever heard of the Khwarezmian Empire. At one time, it extended throughout Central Asia, from the shores of the Caspian Sea to India, and encompassed most of modern day Iran.A trade expedition was sent from the East to the city of Otrar, in hopes of establishing a peaceful commerical relationship. Perhaps suspecting the merchants as spies, the Governor of Otrar had them executed and confiscated their goods. Not wishing this incident to turn into a precursor to war with the powerful Khwarezmids, a second diplomatic expedition was sent to protest the deaths of the merchants, with the request for appropriate reparations. These men were taken before the Shah, Ala ad-Din Muhammad, who had them shaved bald, beheaded, and the heads sent back, with a refusal to pay reparations for the actions of the Governor of Otrar.This displeased the ruler in the East, and so in 1218, the Great Khan – Genghis Khan - assembled 200,000 men and marched on the Khwarezmian Empire. Khwarzemids piss off the wrong guy, maybe? Yeah, you got it. Were they worried? Nah. They outnumbered the Khan's army four to one. The Mongols had nothing but light cavalry, and were going up against well equipped and armed infantry and heavy cavalry, defending some of the most heavily fortified cities in the world. Classic case of overconfidence? Ohh, yee-ah, baby.Two years later, the Empire was in ashes, the Governor and Shah dead, the Shah’s son the sultan fled into India. For the Muslim populations, defeat went beyond simple military conquest. It seemed that God had forsaken them. The Mongols cultivated this idea. After capturing Bukhara, Genghis Khan ascended the pulpit in the Friday mosque and announced:“THOU HAST SINNED, O ISLAM! AND I… I AM THE WRATH OF ALLAH!”Is that what he said? Nah. That’s what I say he said. Historical accounts go something like this:“O people, know that you have committed great sins, and that the great ones among you have committed these sins. If you ask me what proof I have for these words, I say it is because I am the punishment of God. If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you”.I love that story.Now, the viewpoint from the Muslim lands is that this was the beginning of the end for the Golden Age of Islam. The Muslim lands would never recover from the Mongol Catastrophe. Coupled with the internal splintering of religious sects, charges of heresy, assassinations, squabbles and power grabs among the religious and political leaders, along with the occasional irritation of the European Crusades, and it was the end of the golden age of free inquiry, empirical investigations, and advances in science, philosophy, and medicine.Some (unfair) blame has been cast at the feet of one Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al Ghazali, a tenth century philosopher and theologian.During his lifetime, orthodox interpretations of faith were challenged, and skepticism was on the rise. The rap goes along the lines that, like the mullahs of today, he forbade this type of thought, and the tide of religion was turned back towards tradtional belief. Culture was thus “frozen” and no further advances have taken place within the Muslim world.The Muslim world is, by and large, a brutishly backward place. In terms of economic development, they rank second to last only behind Africa. While abject poverty is rare, most of the population – despite the enormous energy wealth – is barely getting by. Public health, literacy, life expectancy, education and the sciences are all at a dismal level.So, is this the Mongols fault? Or al Ghazali’s?Nonsense.It’s quite simply because they have fucked-up leaders.You know, the more I read history, the more I realize it is the story of psychopaths. Occasionally brilliant, ruthless, psychopaths. But more normally, shallow-pated, narrow-browed, blunt-skulled (can I make the brain smaller in any other dimension?) motherfuckers more interested in puffing up their sick, fucked-up, grisly, malformed personalities through petty rivalries and fratricidal conflict.This is not to say the Muslim world has a monopoly on this type of intestinal parasite. The rest of the world, most notably Europe and America, has had very healthy franchises going.As the Russians say, “Whether salt water or fresh, shit floats to the top”."},
{"title": "My inner dog", "date": "Saturday, January 30, 2010", "text": "Note: This is the first entry under the Friday Happy Fun Time label (FHFT). Aren't you excited? I may, at some point, go through my prior entries and label them all. I might also, with the same probability, fold my clothes neatly and put them in the dresser, as opposed to just dressing out of the clothes basket as is my wont. I think you get the picture.Last Friday was my four month anniversary of quitting smoking. I completely spaced it off. I smoked usually a pack a day for thirty-five years. My lungs are as clear as interstellar space. That was a pretty good run.I'm told that it takes six months for all of your body's cells to be replaced, and so the nicotine taint is still with me.I've not really experienced any extreme positive health effects yet. I chalk that up to maintaining a lifestyle of running, and fitness training throughout my life.(Thanks, Coach Tower).Oh, there are some noticeable changes. I don't end up in a coughing fit whenever I laugh now. And I can run a lot farther and faster before really start to suffer (and those who do it know that suffering is when the run actually starts). But, like I say, I'll wait for the six month anniversary before I can really make any judgements on the new lifestyle.I quit cold turkey. It actually wasn't all that bad. Oh, it was bad, but I was able to make it through, so it wasn't all that bad.I tried the patch before. Didn't work. I'd just tear of the patch, light one up, and get a REAL buzz going on. I was going to try the Chantix, until I heard one of the side effects \"thoughts of suicide\".Now, that's a successful quit strategy.Funny (funny strange) thing is, I still have cravings. That actually isn't all that funny, but what's strange is what triggers the cavings. I have some weird triggers.Being around smokers is not a trigger. Sometimes it smells good. A lot of times it does not smell good. Smoke on other people, combined with their personal odors, is usually pretty stinky. I have a feeling, had I not ever started smoking, I'd have gotten laid a lot more than I did.Drinking heavily is not a trigger. Nor is the reptilian torpor behavior after meals. Nor after sex. Well, not so bad that I can't resist it.What's a trigger? The first one I noticed was simply getting into the car after grocery shopping. Oh, yeah! I guess that was a time to light up.Another one? Standing outside in subzero temperatures. I guess the brain rightly assumed the only reason I was outside in that kind of weather was to smoke a ciggie.It's like having a fucking dog in my head. Ready to play catch.You know, we like to think of ourselves as rational entities with conscious control over our thoughts and desires.But no, we are dumb, stupid animals ruled by habit and impulse.No, we are obviously of two minds."},
{"title": "Friday Happy Fun Time", "date": "Friday, January 29, 2010", "text": "I'm going to institute a self-imposed rule, and make Friday entries pretty much frivolous, dumb, stupid, fun things. You know, \"a show about nothing\".But first, let's finish up the politics thread. First off, I slogged through the Republican's Better Solutions pamphlet that all the creepy palsied old farts that look like they smell like bowling shoes handed over to President Obama, so you don't have to. And I gotta say, what the hell is it with politicians? Why can't they just come straight to the point, instead of blathering and bloviating for the first four pages before they finally get to substantive issues? It's not just Republicans, Democrats do it too. But... geez.Okay, finally! The solutions are... same old stinky old stale ideas. What are these guys?Defective robots? Animatronic Refugees from Disneyworld?\"Cut taxes. It'll create jobs and increase government revenue\".  Uh, bullshit to that last part. Look it up. I'll get back to that first part.\"Deregulate\". Yeah, that's... that's worked so well past couple years, huh?\"Let the Free Market do it\".So, Boehner, what's the mortgage like on that Sugarplum House that you live in , over there on Gumdrop Lane in Candy Corn Village? Oh, it's Free! Goodie for you! Canfields for everyone!\"Drill, baby, drill\". Okay, let me get this straight. Price of oil will inevitably go up. Oil, that is under our land up in the Arctic and offshore, is worth more the longer we leave it in the ground. Oil we suck out of the Middle East, at today's comparatively cheap prices, is oil we burn cheap now, as opposed to paying dearly for that oil in the future, at which time we can extract our own oil that we own under our own property at cheaper extraction costs. ... Okay. Got it, O Party of Savvy Business-types!\"Government is too big\". You always say that, but then you help make it bigger, while not being willing to pay for it, and thus sticking our \"children and grandchildren with crushing debt\", which you (*cough*Reagan*cough*Bush the Elder*cough*Bush the Younger*cough*) created... Okay. Got it!Okay, back to the first part about tax cuts above. Hey, here's a laugh. The Republican Smart Solution TM is for everyone to agree not to raise taxes until the unemployment rate hits 5%. Their rather disingenuous statement is, \"Surely you wouldn't want to increase the tax burden during a period of high unemployment? Surely and truly you could not possibly be so mean and cold-hearted\"?Hmm. Let's see. The time is September, 1982. Ronald Reagan, in the depths of a crippling recession, with unemployment at 10.8%, and GDP growth at -1.5%, signs TEFRA (Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act) into law. Most provisions take effect on Jan 1, 1983.Newt Gingrich (R, Ga) with his usual eloquence, comments \"I think it will make the economy sicker\".The Wall Street Journal states \"Any school child knows you don't raise taxes in a recession\".So, what happened? Not much. There's no evidence it made any difference. The economy jumped to 5.0% growth in 1st quarter '83 (sound familiar? 4th quarter '09 5.7%), and jumped to 9.3% 2nd quarter of '83. The unemployment rate slowly dropped to 8.3% by '83 year's end. It didn't reach 5% until 1989.Can Reagan be blamed for his recession? Probably. Can he be lauded for the recovery. Nope.What about Obama? Pretty much the same, I wager. The government is big, but the economy is bigger.I've often thought that a little toy plastic Fisher-Price steering wheel with a nice cute sounding horn be installed on the President's desk, just to remind him how much control he has over the economy.Yeah, that's the ticket."},
{"title": "If it ain't fixed, don't break it", "date": "Thursday, January 28, 2010", "text": "Shades of the echo chamber effect! This entry is a response to Ellen Abbott's musings that perhaps the only way for the US to move forward is for it to be divided. Unfortunately, unlike the Recent Unpleasantness of the 1860's, we no longer have the luxury of convenient geographical boundaries in which to separate - amicably or (more likely) not.Nor can we easily divide ourselves along party lines. Times change, labels stay the same, and everything goes topsy-turvy. The Republican Party of today is certainly not the party of Lincoln. Nor are the Democrats any more than a pale specter of a once staggeringly racist and oppressive movement. Even labels such as conservative and liberal no longer provide easy demarcations - save at the batshit-crazy extreme ends of the spectrum. Despite the historically conservative leanings of the US of A, most people ARE, whether they admit it or not, socially liberal. We are a community-minded folk, willing to help and share (you goddamn fucking commies). So political or ideological affiliation doesn't make for good borders (except, of course, for the wing-nuts, who, since they all seem to have shows on the TV, should be, as far as I'm concerned, shipped off to Reeducation Camps in the Nevada Desert). What about along income lines? Do we really need rich people, or, as the kids call 'em, douchebags (and isn't it about time we had a good disparaging term for fortunate pampered white people)? After all, study after study has shown that there is no link between being rich and being smart. And really, most of them just have the good luck to be born into fortunate circumstances, like living in a prosperous representative civil society, having a network of family and friends to provide privileged information, and the means and wherewithal to commit expensive mistakes. Douchebags really don't seem to do much except collect big bonuses and ruin global economies. Popular opinion would suggest they (\"they\" being, what, earning more than $150,000 a year, which is pretty much everyone on Wall Street and Congress) could easily be sent into exile. Well, that's really not fair, now is it? After all, it's quite possible you could get lucky tomorrow. Perhaps win the lottery, and then invest in a company that invents a robot that knows when to kick people in the nads at just the right moment, like when they use the word \"paradigm\", or \"meme\".Okay, how about along IQ lines? That seems to make sense, right? But you know how that goes. Eugenics. And once you start segregating dumb people, why, ugly people are next, and then, quite naturally, homos, and spazzes, weirdoes, dorks, and then the next thing you know, we're right back to where we started - provided any of us have survived the gleaning process. Besides, I know for a fact that smart people can act as dumb as the next guy. We all deserve a second chance.   So what are we to do? Should we accelerate what seems to be a world trend towards Balkanization? Split up our patchwork nation? I think that would be huge mistake. I'm sorry I don't have a better idea at the moment, but I'm thinking about a few things. Give me time."},
{"title": "Wither America", "date": "Wednesday, January 27, 2010", "text": "It's pretty obvious to any serious student of American history that, if we ever become a military dictatorship, it will be a right-wing dictatorship, and under a conservative agenda. Lefties simply have never had the sympathies, ideological will, or power base to accomplish anything close to socialism - not even under Roosevelt's New Deal administration.It is therefore the duty of all freedom-loving progressives to counter the inertia towards the right. It is even more crucial for conservatives to constantly police their own kind. Since the founding of constitutional government in 1787 (after the failure of the Libertarian Free Market Utopia under the Articles of Confederation) we've had more than our fair share of overzealous or incompetent conservative leaders, who in their minds just Wanted to Do the Right Thing. The road to hell, etc.It seems unlikely that conservatives have the emotional maturity or intellectual capacity  to police themselves, and hopefully I'm wrong about this. But, big-picture-wise, conservatives have ALWAYS been on the wrong side of change. Valuing tradition and the status quo, they've had a consistent track record of opposing change for the better. They've, over time, been for slavery, for the oppression of women, for exploitation of weaker nations, against science and technology, against social experiments like capitalism, public charity, and education. Its only been as a last resort, and typically after a generation dies off, that conservatives come around to liberal traditions such as, oh, I don't know, liberty, freedom, and the American way (equality for all under the law, an equal chance at competition, and a level playing field).A standard canard about participatory democracy goes something like \"If you didn't vote, you don't have the right to complain about the results\". Really? I'm paying taxes, so I figure I can complain if I want to, regardless of what you say.Anyway, it seems to me, not voting is the same as voting for None of the Above (NotA). I didn't vote in the last presidential election. I didn't do so because I didn't like either candidate.Given a choice between a senile old right-wing throwback to the Austro-Hungarian style of imperial militarist rule with zero impulse control (McCain), and his batshit-crazy self-serving tiny-brained Half-Baked Alaskan running mate (Palin), or the right-center Closet Reaganite masquerading as a progressive (Obama, and come on now, does anyone over the age of 8-years-old REALLY think he is a progressive?), and his loudmouth running mate (Biden), I chose NotA. And so, it seems I have a perfect right to say \"Hey, don't blame me. I didn't vote for either one of them assholes!\"If you look at national voter turnout during presidential election years since 1968, the average hovers around 52%. Before that, it was around 60% or so.You might think 52% is pretty good. Take, for example, 2008, with 56.8% of voting age population participating in democracy. Or 2004, with 55.3%. But then, that means that, in the 2004 presidential election, 44.7% of eligible voters chose NotA. That's 98,961,953 people. Bush was elected by 62,028,285 people. And didn't Bush declare a\"mandate\"? Ah-ha-ha-ha!Or take 2008, with 231,229,580 eligible voters, 98,611,000 people chose NotA. 66,882,230 people voted for Obama. 58,343, 671 people voted for McCain. In fact, NotA has been winning elections since, wow, 1960. That's pretty good.Well, I guess it's a sign of the direction this country is taking.Right-Wing Dictatorship in 2020. Destruction of the Middle Class in 2021. Total Economic Meltdown in 2022. Canadian barbarians sack Washington DC in 2024. Russians buy Disneyworld, ship it to Siberia in 2080. Everyone looks Chinese in 2106. Thanks, Conservatives!"},
{"title": "Cargo Cults (continued but different)", "date": "Tuesday, January 26, 2010", "text": "My college years were spend at Indiana University. I have some nice memories of being there,  but I really have no great longings for the place. Nor am I likely, as an alumnus, to contribute any further monies to them. Indiana University really should stop pestering me for revenue. When their cheerful little phone marketing coeds call up, I just tell them I'm unemployed and can't help them out. They get embarassed for me, and hang up pretty quickly, which is what I want them to do. As far as I can see, we had a business contract, which was fulfilled, completed, finished, and now we are done. They supplied me with a degreed certification, stating that I was vaguely qualified for some type of occupation, and I (ahem, my parents and I) supplied them with monetary reimbursement, and really, that should be the end of that.I'm not entirely satisfied with my education. I started out with an art scholarship when I entered college. I came out the other end with a degree in mathematics. I'd prefer to think I don't know how that happened, but, of course I do. Primarily, it's because I'm lazy.\"Lazy?!\" you exclaim, perhaps with a husky little uplifted squeak at the end, which you know I find so endearing, \"but math is HARD! How can you call yourself lazy?\"Well, let me explain. When you are taught higher mathematics (calculus and up), you are shown a big bag of tools. And at first it all looks very confusing and intimidating, because the tools are all mixed up in the bag and you are not quite sure what each of them does. But as you go along, the tools are laid out one by one. The function and purpose of each is made clear, and it turns out that the tool itself, and how to use it, is not all that hard to grasp, once it is explained. It actually turns out that the hardest part of learning higher mathematics is algebra.  What is x? Well, x can be any number. You can plug any number into x and solve stuff like x2 - 2x +2. Once you've got algebra figured out, most of higher math falls into place. It is just repeating rules you've already learned, and usually through rote learning. The hard part of picking up algebra is something that we've all learned, or were supposed to learn, at a much younger age. It's when we learn to move from thinking about things in concrete terms to abstractions.This is not to say doing higher math isn't hard. The actual hard part is knowing when to use the tools that a situation calls for. When should you, metaphorically speaking, use a screwdriver instead of a hammer. That capacity actually has nothing to do with mathematics. It has more to do with a certain style of thinking.One of the best books I ever read was entitled \"The Art of Probability\" by Richard W. Hamming. The book is primarily devoted to probability, but I found, over the years, that the scope and importance extended well beyond this limited field, well, beyond math and physics, into, really a realm of thought and into an actual lifestyle. Reading Hamming over and over again, I came to finally understand this quote (you may, if you wish, substitute whatever activity you find important in your life for the word \"probability\", and then, perhaps, it makes sense):\"Probability theory provides a way, indeed a style, of thinking about such problems and situations... This style of thinking is an art and is not easy to master; both the historical evidence based on its late development, and the experience of current teaching, show that much careful thinking on the student's part is necessary before probability becomes a mental habit\".What I got from this is, a slow and measured examination of assumptions, and the resulting consequences of their adoption, is a far harder mental task than mere formal manipulation and rote repetition of logical and reasonable arguments. In other words, cutting though the bullshit is an art form."},
{"title": "Cargo Cults (continued)", "date": "Friday, January 22, 2010", "text": "The reason I'm having a hard time getting this train of thought out of the station is that the overarching theme may be a bit multiferous in its sources, pursuits, and ramifications. Perhaps by bulldozing all the exits, I'll finally be able to set the theater ablaze and yell \"Fire!\"I'm sure whoever reads my thoughts must think that the overarching theme of my essays is that People are Just So Goddamn Fucking Dumb As All Hell Dip-shitily Moronically Idiotically Stupid. And I can understand how this impression could be arrived at. And I'm sure it all sounds overly negative and generally unhelpful in terms of prescribing soothing balms for the human condition.But that's really not my intent. I would prefer, hopefully, to make my message \"Hey, we are all smarter than this. These problems we have really aren't that hard. We can figure this out\". In short, a message of hope, delivered, when necessary, via frying pan upside the head.Yesterday, I described Cargo Cults, and then proceeded to bash on so-called Critical Thinkers. Specifically, Critical Thinkers with scare quotes around them. Self-proclaimed pundits and experts found on the Internet, in the media, print, radio, TV, etc.  who pretend to be critical thinkers. They may be fooling themselves in the process. But an extensive analysis of their arguments, and the rhetorical posturing and posing surrounding them, will show them to be frauds.They may have, at one point or another,  been exposed to reasonably intelligent and rational adults, and come across the rules and regulations governing learned discussion, and studied the methods of discourse. And like Cargo Cultists, so think that, if they merely ape these behaviors, if they perform the rituals, the Manna of Intelligence will fall from the skies, and they shall be made smart. In other words, through a version of sympathetic magic, if these sad, stupid sorry dumbasses act as if they were college professors, they will be accepted as degreed professionals, and accorded all the deference and respect they think they deserve. The sadder thing is, quite a few of them are degreed professionals. But as my Old Man once said, on being exposed to a pea-brained pompous braying ass with a legitimate PhD, \"Just goes to show you, any asshole can get a degree\". God's Stinky Old Dentures, I see these assholes all the time.

{"title": "Cargo Cults", "date": "Thursday, January 21, 2010", "text": "Note: I'm a little distracted with work and competing ideas today. I'll have to write this in installments. It may take some time for this locomotive to build up steam and pull this train of thought properly. If this entry don't make much sense, I'll try to steer it where I want it go... eventually.Around the 1940s or thereabouts, on some islands in the South Pacific, a lot of white men suddenly appeared from out of the skies and seas. And they brought with them processed foods, starchy white flours, candies, radios, watches, trucks, jeeps, washing machines, canned meat, iceboxes, medicines, Coca-Cola, and many, many other wonderful things. And then one day they just all up and vanished. The natives didn't know where the endless supplies of goodies came from, and so assumed they were summoned by magic. And knowing more than their fair share of ritual and superstition, they constructed crude piers along their shores, and carved airstrips from their fields and jungles. They prayed for the ships and planes to come again, and performed military ceremonies, marching in perfect step and ranks, toting bamboo \"rifles\", with certain locals imitating the strident cadence of drills sergeants. But, aside from the trickle of a few tourists and old veterans, the magical G.I.s never returned.We Americans who precipitated these cults may smirk and laugh at their naivete, but are we any less primitive? Aren't there certain things, certain mysterious events and items, that we, for all practical purposes, feel arrived by magic, from the spirit world? Oh, I think so.Now, I'm not really talking about religious fundamentalists, or social conservatives (the American Taliban, as I call them, as they share so many values and opinions with those Islamist creeps). Although they easily come to mind. Nor am I talking about the faithful consumers. Those who, with every trip to the gas station, or the pharmacy, or the grocery store, display a simple act of faith in assuming that, since these goods have always been there, they always will be there.They have only a vague conception of how items appear on store shelves, or how government subsidies make them cheaper than they really are. Nor am I talking about the SHAM (Self-Help and Actualization) artists, the fuzzy thinkers, the New Agers, the crystal creeps, the ones who believe in astrology, or anything labelled \"quantum\", fans of Deepak Copra and The Secret. They can be dismissed as marginal, targeted by the media and easily and readily manipulated. And besides, when push comes to shove, when things get tough all over, they discard this mystic baggage in favor of more pragmatic behaviors.No, I'm talking about the ones who consider themselves sophisticates. The Critical Thinkers. The self-styled Critical Thinkers at any rate. One thing I've noticed is, they all can parrot the terminology. They have read through the glossary of terms, the definitions of logical fallacies. They make use of phrases like \"strawman\" and \"non sequitur\" and \"ad hominem\" in so-called \"debates\". But few have any conception of how to investigate claims, or how to formulate a reasoned argument. If they've managed to build a reasoned argument, they often miss the fact that the logical construction they've fashioned still fails miserably because it is built upon  a faulty premise. In Internet debates, they are constantly distracted and sidelined by trivial tangental issues, or questions of \"semantics\". On TV and radio, the pundits cannot properly map out fundamental issues. In short, despite our proclamations to the contrary, we Americans SUCK at critical thinking.(More later)."},

I possess certain... idiosyncrasies. Among the strangest of them is that I like to be outdoors during the winter. I love cold weather.You've probably seen people like me as you drive by in your nicely heated automobile. Running. Skating. Skiing. Walking. Vacuous smile plastered on a drippy-nosed, red-cheeked face, a fog of breath appearing from underneath a snot-smeared upper lip. I think it is the running that freaks people out the most.\"Look at that idiot\", they say. \"Running. Running! In the snow!  I hope he slips and breaks something, the freak!\"I've slowed down some. I don't ski or skate as often as I used to. But, and this sounds strange, I do train for winter. I know a lot of people who train for summer. Get in shape for bikini season and all that. But train for winter? That's just crazy talk.Now, it could be the Scandinavian ancestry. There does seem to be something behind how tough we are in the cold. Which would kind of suggest that we've also been bred to enjoy it.It could be where I grew up. Northwest Indiana, perched as it is on the south shore of Lake Michigan, gets more than its fair share of snow. When the wind blows in from the north, we get the entire lake, all 300 plus miles, to provide moisture for a good lake effect snow. Twelve inches a day - and sometimes an hour - is not uncommon. It is an extremely rare winter when we get no snow at all. So, we have the winter wonderland effect. It is encouraging to go out into this, this clean white landscape, as opposed to a brown grass desert topped with grey sky that some have to put up with.It could also be the family and community tradition for outdoor activities in any type of weather. But again, that might be a Northern European type of thing.All I know is, not so much now, but in the past, with all the outdoor activity, I'm one of the few I know who has a tan come March. And maybe that's why I don't succumb to Seasonal Affective  Disorder. Getting whatever sunlight I can. Getting the incredibly fresh air down from the arctic. Not being sky deprived.I know people hate me when I burst in from out-of-doors, in a good mood, exclaiming how that bitter frigid cutting bone-chilling crud out there is \"exhilarating\".Geez. Sorry!"},

{"title": "Shameless Plug", "date": "Thursday, January 14, 2010", "text": "I completely forgot. Another reason to write online journal entries is for self-promotion. So here we go.I am a participant in the Rockford Art Museum's Midwestern Biennial. The show is opening January 22nd, 2010, and running through April 25th, 2010.I have two entries in the show. The first entry is entitled \"Hooke's Constant\". The piece is made of wood, fabricated metal, glass, and springs. I made everything except for the springs.Well, that's a a slight exaggeration. I did not make the metal, wood, or springs. I didn't even smelt the metal. Or grow the wood. Or wind the springs. I purchased all that stuff. But the glass is hand-blown. By me. And I did the bending and welding and stuff.\"Hooke's Constant\" is a number representing the restoring force of a spring, which is directly related to the length it is stretched (within reason). The only physical quantity named after the English natural philosopher, robert Hooke. Hooke was a contemporary of Isaac Newton. A man of rather diminutive stature, he was nevertheless brimming with energy and occupied with countless pursuits and investigations into the natural world. A demonstrator for the Royal Society, he did much usher our world into modern times, and banished a great deal of nonsense and superstitious thought in the process.The second piece is entitled \"Sensoria\". The busts are made of cast bronze and are mounted on a sheet of plate steel. The work is quite dense and heavy as sin. The piece originally was intended as something of an explanation for a series of works I did involving masked figures. Starting from the unaltered bust of a woman, each woman in the circle loses a sense. It was, at the time, a comment upon electronic remediation, but since no one seemed to understand that, I just shut up and let the piece stand on it's own.Not really all that much more to say about this, I suppose. You know, I'm trying to figure out why I'm writing an online journal. (And I just can't use the word \"blog\". I realize my not using the word will not eradicate it from the English language. It's a personal preference. To me, it's just a clunky and dorky word, infused with the insincere and insecure sincerity of breathless adolescence. I mean, even the original phrase \"web log\" is irritating. First of all, you have the out-of-fashion \"web\" as in\"World Wide Web\", as in \"Helloo, 2010? 1994 wants it's phrase back\". And then you have the word \"log\". Log? Who the fuck do you think you are? Captain Kirk on the Starship Enterprise? Here's a clue. You are just not that important, you cheese log!).So, anyway, one of the reasons I write an online journal entry is to get out of work. The Internet, for me, has existed since 1995, and the Internet's primary purpose is to get out of doing things. Back when I had a real job, supporting laughable business software in soon-to-be-extinct billion-dollar Soviet-structured corporate dinosaurs, the Internet was there for me to waste an enormous amount of time. It wasn't just me. In retrospect, during the 1990s - to borrow from Winston Churchill - \"Never had so many undeservedly earned so much money to waste so much time on so few accomplishments\". Or something like that. This, dearies, is, to me, one aspect of the very essence of Capitalism - to earn as much money doing as little as possible. I think 2008 is ironclad proof.Well, times change, and I'm a bit different now. I became obsolete \"retired\"  from the IT industry in 2001. If you've looked at my profile, you'll notice I list my profession as \"sculptor\". This is true. It is one of  the things I do, but occupying perhaps no more than a third of my waking hours. I earn, basically almost zero dollars in this pursuit. The largest amount of time I burn through, the part that allows me to eke out a living at pretty much Fourth World wages, is as Studio Technician at the community college where I work. Although a better job title would be \"janitor/nanny\", or \"nanny/janitor\", or maybe \"nannitor\", or perhaps \"The Terminanny\".The nanny part actually only occurs when school is in session. The janitor part is ongoing. So that's what I'm doing today, and not just today, but pretty much every day that I've added an entry to this online journal. \"Dear diary, today I fucked around - yet again!\"Well, I actually would like this journal to serve some type of purpose. I think I've tried, and may try harder, to be an edutainer in the service of Science. I think it was the late Walter Cronkite who said that \"the only news that is really news is science news\". I think, if he said it, that he was right. So there's that.But honestly, Big, Big Fan that I am, even I get bored with some of the stuff. So maybe I should write about other stuff as well. Well, you know, they say \"Write what you know\". Well, I know me, but honestly, I'm pretty boring as well. But what the heck. We'll give a shot.(Next: Things I've Done on The Internet - or - How to Communicate with Total Strangers From All Over the Planet, and Grow to Hate Them)"},
{"title": "\"Wall Street Is An Asshole\" - Bumper Sticker", "date": "Tuesday, January 12, 2010", "text": "Note: I may have come up with a killer app. You've got spellcheck for proofreading. You've got spellcheckplus (spelling check and grammar check). What you don't have is definitioncheck. Problem is, it is an app meant more for readers than writers. Your average American has the IQ of a carrot, and needs an app that flags big words what they don't know what it means. The problem is with hyperlinks, it is a cumbersome process to find out the meaning (click the link and read the definition in a separate page, then try to remember what the fuck it was you were doing, with yet another open window to distract you). Instead, there should be one of those java script thingies, so that when you put your little pointer arrow on the word, a balloon appears with the summarized definition. That way we have one less thing to remember, and can all get just a little bit dumber, and use our brains just a little bit less. Whoever is out there that does all the work and comes up with this app, you better fucking send me a royalty check.I once had a chance to get up close and personal with a B-17 Flying Fortress at an air show. The B-17 was employed in the daytime bombing of Germany during WWII. Underneath the plane is a ridiculously small plexiglass bubble where the belly gunner sits. My Uncle Ed was a belly gunner. Small wonder, then, that he was an alcoholic. Flying in these bombers was not a pleasant experience. Aside from the cramped conditions, the lack of oxygen, the below-freezing temperatures, the inability to void your waste products in an expeditious or dignified manner, there would also be encounters with pesky German fighter planes who would hurtle high velocity large caliber lead projectiles at you, and flak - truly evil-looking pieces of sharp-edged shrapnel from exploding anti-aircraft artillery shells. These artillery shells were designed using a mathematical technique which combined probability theory and operational optimization. You have an explosive shell, and, by scoring the surface, you can control its fragmentation. It will break up into pieces of a certain size. How many pieces do you want? How large should they be? If the pieces are too small, they may not do much damage. If the pieces are big, they will do real harm. But you will have less pieces, and the chance of hitting the plane will be correspondingly less. This philosophical exercise isn't just theoretical, and it isn't just a horrifyingly cold little academic calculation. Lives are at stake. Blood and treasure are at risk.So, anyway, yesterday I actually started on something which may develop into an extended theme, namely, simulations and models. A large part of the theme is that most mathematical or computer models, really having only a partial, idealized description of reality (not unlike a philosophical exercise) are silly. Well, let's briefly talk about philosophical exercise. It requires a certain suspension of disbelief, a degree of let's pretend, a modicum of play. At its best, it is informed, structured speculation, a good form of improvisational comedy, an exercise of the mind. At its worst, it is trite and annoying, a clumsy form of public masturbation, like a Quentin Tarantino movie.The ancient Greeks were very good at coming up with these silly exercises, such as the Ship of  Theseus: an exercise in identity, persistence, categorization, that will, for most people who check out the link, suck all the joy, the precious juice of life, right out of your day, cause your eyes to roll into the back of your head, and your head to slam into the edge of your desk and give you a nasty bleeding gash that will require stitches. The ancient Greeks were probably also very good at public masturbation, but I've no real desire to check up on that.   The interesting, or appalling thing, depending upon your point of view, is how often these idealized models inform our day-to-day behavior. Take, for example, the Flak Problem related above. Milton Friedman, the Nobel-prize winning economist, and fucker-up of the Chilean economy (among other things), was one of the first to notice the similarity between portfolio investment strategy and the optimal explosive pattern of anti-aircraft shells. (Not surprising, as he worked on the mathematical modeling of both).  Friedman, and many others, were working under the assumption - now (post-Panic of 2008) pretty much discredited except by a few die-hard lunatic Libertarian idiot types - that the stock market is both efficient and rational. How the fuck they ever managed to delude themselves that this was the case is beyond me, but that is the model.Of course, anyone who has even the slightest ability of even the most superficial of observations about human - or should it be simian? - behavior, knows that the market is composed of actions produced by irrational choices by irrational dumb, stupid, herd animals motivated by fear and greed. There is, after all, a reason why all the market upsets have been called Panic of this or that year. The market, as a model, mirrors only coincidentally attributes of the \"real\" economy. The market is there to be manipulated, and everyone is manipulating the market. If it wasn't for everybody manipulating the market, there wouldn't be a stock market at all.  One of the premises of financial forecasting is that the fluctuations of stock prices are completely random. A statistical analysis of prices by mathematical economists has suggested otherwise, but, as is usual with mathematical conveniences, the modeling of fluctuations as random were \"close enough\". Thus flawed and faulty financial equations and instruments were and are used that assume price changes are random. Instruments used that assume that, on average, market behavior rests comfortably under the classic bell curve. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb likes to say, Wall Street ignores \"black swans\", or \"fat tails\" (the extreme edges outside of the bell curve behavior, the bubbles and busts) at their peril.Now, there are still free market apologetics out there who, in a rather pathetic infantile whine, complain the the government should have saved us from ourselves (irony alert), that the SEC watchdog should have curbed this insane and irrational behavior before the party got out of hand.But this was never the intended purpose of the Securities and Exchange Commission. When the SEC (fortunately or unfortunately the legislation written NOT by mathematical economists, but by lawyers and bankers) was created in 1934, the intent was... how to reassure the public that the stock market was not rigged? (Remember folks, in the 30s, a LOT of financial executives, rather than getting obscenely huge bonuses for fucking up the economy, went to jail). The SEC's mission was \"to restore public confidence in the securities market\". In other words, how to make the stock market look real?The answer was stringent new laws aimed, not at the sweaty mob of average Americans, but at the Wall Street Elite, to make sure that never again would their manipulations of their poop-covered dirty birdie fingers soil the clean white linen sheets resting upon great altar of Capitalism.  In other words Securities Police Theater, to borrow the phrase \"security theater\" from Bruce Schneier. Fake controls on a fake model of a toy economy which does nothing to protect very, very real livelihoods. Not quite a danger to all of us, but certainly an inconvenience. Fun, huh?"},
{"title": "The Model is Only as Good As the Model", "date": "Monday, January 11, 2010", "text": "I recently finished a book called \"The Genie in the Machine\" by Robert Plotkin. Plotkin is a patent attorney. He also writes a blog. In the book, Plotkin documents and comments upon computer automated invention, or computer assisted creativity. Automated invention, through the use of either the evolutionary software of genetic algorithms, or the brain function approximation software of neural networks, or combinations thereof, have already produced money making inventions. Companies have sprouted up which take advantage of this technique, such as Natural Selection, Tenfold, NuTech Solutions, and Imagination Engines.Plotkin insists we will soon enter the age of Automatic Invention Age, and I have no reason to doubt it. Still, I'm not going to recommend the book, as Plotkin spends entirely too much time on the legal process of patents, and how this new process will affect the legal world, and not enough on the fun geek stuff. But here's an excerpt from the book that caught my eye, perhaps because it stirred a memory from something I read in the late 90s (italics mine): \"Thinking Machines founder Danny Hillis used evolutionary computation software to create programs for sorting numbers. When you give such a program a list of scrambled numbers 9 8 2 7 3,  it gives you back a sorted list of the same numbers: 2 3 7 8 9. Hillis examined the number-sorting programs that his software had evolved but could not understand how they work.  \"I have carefully examined their instruction sequences, but I do not understand them: I have no simpler explanation of how the programs work than the instruction sequences themselves. It may be that the programs are not understandable\"\".In other words, Hillis could not find a simpler way of describing the program except for the program statements themselves, or by watching a computer execute the program. Now, this is actually a problem faced by mathematicians and physicists. In order to understand the behavior of something, say, a water spout, or an avalanche, scientists will try to create a simpler, more idealized model. In doing so, they have to eliminate or ignore some parts of what they are studying, and hope that the parts they ignore are not too important in determining a general behavior. (You can imagine that, prior to the age of computers, this was a very dull, dreary, boring series of steps involving a great deal of arithmetical drudgery, and you'd be right. Even now, in the age of computers, this still can be a difficult task). But there is a problem with simulation. If the model is made too simple, the model is just a toy. It really doesn't simulate properly what it is you want to study. It may not show behaviors you know - through careful observation - to occur in the real thing. Then again, if you include too many parts to simulate, you find that your model is too complex. In fact, what you find, to your great dismay, is that the model is even more complicated than the actual thing you are studying.  To put it in a silly way (as in philosophical, as philosophy is generally silly), if I were to create a model of the universe, and run the model on a computer, I would need to create a computer bigger than the universe, and run a program on it more complex than the universe. And well, that's just very, very silly. Cue Graham Chapmans' The Colonel."},
{"title": "Comet Wars", "date": "Friday, January 8, 2010", "text": "One of my problems - and there are many - is that I'm just not smart enough.There are times when, studying some topic, I come very close to getting a handle on it. I am just shy of having a powerful insight or possibly game-changing answer, and then things get all confused and convoluted in my head and whatever it was just slips away. It's like being stoned. Which... you know, I hardly ever do anymore.Now, supposedly, I'm very smart. According to the IQ and the SAT and the GRE tests, I score in the 99.98 percentile, which means that I am in the top 2% of the top 2%. You've heard of MENSA? The organization for smart people with IQs in the top 2%? I met someone who was a MENSA member once. They wuz, lyke, reelly, reely stoopid.  Of course, that IQ test of mine was nine concussions ago. I figure I've lost ten points with each concussion, which means the next inevitable one will turn me into some kind of baby seal - after the Eskimos have had their fun.And it has me worried about the rest of humanity, because, compared to me, the average person has the IQ of a carrot. And not a particularly bright carrot either.Honestly and truthfully, though, I just ain't all that smart. And even more scary, I know people who are so smart that they make me look like a carrot! And they ain't all that smart either. So, I'm worried about us.But that's not what I want to talk about.For those of you not In The Know, let's talk about the K-T Event. That's shorthand for the Cretaceous-Tertiary Extinction Event. The prevailing scientific thought is that some 65 million years ago, a big comet smacked into the Earth with the force of a 100 million megatons. (That's, um, about a couple hundred thousand times more powerful than the total world's nuclear arsenal going kablooey all at once in one place). The result of this big, huge smoking hole in the ground was that the dinosaurs went extinct. There's a lot of evidence for it, and since evidence is really all that matters, that's why scientists think that is what happened.Yesterday, in the previous journal entry, I said that the Dinosaurs had a Comet War(!)Meaning, I suppose, that some species of dinosaur got smart, and got so smart that they developed space travel. They got so smart and powerful that they could fling comets and asteroids around. Oh, well, and then they got all pissy with each other. War broke out. The weapons they used were comets and asteroids, and they wiped themselves out.No, that really didn't happen.At least, I don't think it did. The Earth is what? 4 and a half billion years old? And as far as we know, in all that time, only one species got smart, or should I say \"smart\"? Just us monkeys? No lizards? No frogs? Octopi? Clams? Mats of gelatinous slime? Seems kind of weird, doesn't it? That only one species managed the task? Well, anyway, I noticed in the news that Russia is scared of Aphophis. Apophis is an asteroid that was first sighted and calculated to hit the Earth in the year 2036. Its about 750 feet from end to end, or two and a half football fields for those of you who like sports. If it smacked into the Earth, it should produce an impact force of about 880 megatons, which is equivalent to several hundred thousand trillion Easy Bake Ovens for those of you who like cookies and brownies.Well, now its calculated that Apophis won't hit the Earth. But ROSCOSMOS, the Russian space agency, wants to use it for practice anyway. They want to try out some deflection technology or strategy to nudge the orbit some, or some destruction plan like in that awful movie \"Armageddon\", which Hollywood should have just forked the budget over to ROSCOSMOS from the get-go, since it was such a fucking horrible smoking hole in the ground of a movie.Anyway, the one problem which most people don't think about it is... if you develop the technology to nudge asteroids and comets away from the Earth to protect us from impacts, doesn't that mean you also have the technology to nudge things toward us?Oh, crap! Didn't see that coming. Smart, huh? And funny. The whole Unintended Consequences thing cracks me up. How making ourselves safe from one thing puts us at risk from something else."},
{"title": "Missile #27", "date": "Thursday, January 7, 2010", "text": "The year I was born, there were no satellites up in orbit. There were no Artificial Moons circling the Earth. Yeah? So what?Then, when I was still just a itty bitty teeny tiny little baby, on October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. And a month later, a larger and heavier satellite called (surprise!) Sputnik 2 carried a dog named Laika into space.Laika died.That's kind of sad, but then 22 astronauts and cosmonauts have died since then, and an even larger number of ground crew. Going into space is dangerous. But that's not what I want to talk about.Few people know October 4, 1957 is a historic date. I think it is because people just don't care. Really. Even fewer people know that September 20, 1956 could have been a historic date. That was the date that the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) sent aloft Missile 27 from Cape Canaveral. This was an Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) test. The rocket reached an altitude of 600 miles, and splashed into the Atlantic Ocean some 3,300 miles away. The launch team was not authorized to orbit a satellite, and besides no one had asked them to do it. So the team replaced the solid rocket fuel in the fourth stage of the missile with sand.History records the result. A great deal of pants shitting occurred on or about the date of Oct. 5, 1957.As is customary, the media was the first to shit itself, as usual. \"SOVIETS CAN HIT US FROM SPACE WITH BOMBS! NOT A DAMN THING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT!\"And they made such a hue and cry, such a wailing, such a tumult, such a dancing about of the Shitty Pants Dance, that everyone couldn't help but notice - which is what the media does, right?Congress, not to be outdone, upped the ante, and called many special press conferences to show that they too, had done a spectacular job of projectile pooping, staining their undies right down to their socks.Naturally the public took its cue, and soon practically every horizontal surface was damp and soiled.Poor old President Eisenhower. He now had to respond to all this. But there were things he knew which he could not tell the media or the public. Things he knew that a select few in both the House and the Senate were aware of. (That time being a different age, when duplicity and deceit were highly valued, and thus used more sparingly, those in Congress who were In The Know were not inclined to do the Shitty Pants Dance). What things did Eisenhower know? Consulting with his administration, he knew that the US missile programs were doing fine, thank you, on par or well ahead of the Soviets. Eisenhower knew, from U2 high altitude spy plane overflights of the Soviet Union, that the state of Soviet armaments and preparedness was just barely above donkey cart mode. In short, he knew that Sputnik did not constitute an immediate threat to the security of the United States. He knew that there was no such thing as a Missile Gap. (This fact, of course, did not stop John F Kennedy from instilling fear in the American public in a cheap ploy to get elected by LYING about the Missile Gap, or for that matter, a generation later, for Ronald Reagan to LIE about a similar Missile Gap when the Soviet Union was on the ropes, a shattered starving skeleton of itself, or for one more matter, for George W Bush to LIE about WMDs existing in a basket case of a nation, but that's for another rant). He held a press conference in an attempt to quell the fears of the American people. He utterly failed to calm the hysteria, and in fact, came across as perhaps a little too detached and clueless. The media was telling the public that, because we are now not safe something had gone wrong, and someone was at fault and to blame, and then things must be fixed. And the public, paradoxically, individually calm and relatively intelligent, but collectively stupid and anxious, desperately needing something, anything, to be done, demanded that something be done, even if the thing to be done was pointless, useless, and a waste of time and monies.Sound familiar? War on Terrorism, maybe? Perhaps?Well, fear not, things turned out well for the USA! Not now, silly. We are doing exactly what the terrorists want us to do - waste blood and treasure. Things turned out well back then. In the end, the Russians had actually done the US a good turn. NASA and DARPA was established, Congress authorized a big budget increase for science and engineering education, not to mention funding for corporate and university R&D, and kids across the country went space crazy. And we spent ten trillion dollars on the best damn Mutual Assured Destruction 20,000 warhead missile system not seen since the Dinosaurs had their Comet War.Makes you proud, don't it?"},
{"title": "Pixel, Texel, Voxel, Doxel", "date": "Wednesday, December 30, 2009", "text": "Some time ago, I was engaged in a discussion over at the Backyard Metal Casting Forums. I very much doubt that anyone would be very interested in the discussion per se, but it had very little to do with Santa Claus Machines. Otherwise known as A Machine To Grant Your Every Wish, or Universal Constructors, Star Trek's Replicators, Fabricators, or just \"fabbers\". Basically, a machine that makes what you want. Crude versions exist today. They cost several dozen arms and legs. Eventually the crudity and cost will come down, but for now, use of the machines is constrained to rapid prototyping for new product designs, experimental models, and components.  They usually consist of a PC with design software, a 3D printer, and possibly a 3D scanner.   Artists, and more specifically sculptors, are interested in this stuff... and people who do not have design skills, artistic talent, or patience are also interested in it. The short version of the BYMC discussion went something like this: \"I have a backyard furnace and lots of scrap metal with which to cast things. I have many, many ideas of things I wish to cast. However, I lack the skills/talent/interest to make the models of the things I wish to mold for casting. As a geek, I can instead create digital objects in CAD or Google Sketchup and I want to head down this route, instead of learning how to make things with my hands\".\"Go for it, dude.  Here is a list of manufacturers that make 3D printers. Hope you have enough dough\".Now, I thought about this, and of course, got all philosophical about the subject. And I could have written a very long essay, but eventually I summarized my position to this:\"I don't ever plan on using any of this technology. At least for now. Reason being, it would take all the fun out of the tedium\".What do I mean by that? Well, aside from creating a Lowest Common Denominator social phenomenon of cheapening the creative process, where now just any dumbass can make stuff. (And I really don't have a problem with that, for the same reason I do not worry about plagiarism, because the Gap will always exist between those that got it, and those that don't). I won't use the technology, because the tedious part of making things, which is the majority of it, gives one time for reflection and introspection. Reflection because, as you make something, you make errors. As you make errors, avenues open up to take the thing you are making in a new or different direction. This is one of the reasons to make not just one art object, but a series of them. You usually find that the last, or second to last, in the series is the best. Or you find that the series mutates into something you would never, ever have thought of.  Had the design been executed in a robotic, or programmatic manner, reflection is lost.Introspection because, as you make something, a feedback process occurs in the creative process. One that would not exist without the necessary paradox of wasted effort. It's hard to put into words. Its not giving up. Its moving on. Its questioning, not so much the worth, or meaning, or attractiveness, or utility of the object, but more like the value of it. Is this something that deserves to exist in the world? Do I really want to put in the time and effort to make this thing? Without experiencing the whole tedious material manipulation process, the feedback loop cannot exist.So there you go. I'm not a Luddite or anything. If I can make use of the technology, I'll use it.  I also recognize my own limitations, and just as if I need something done which I have neither the time nor talent, I'll farm it out. And when the day comes that the technology is cheap, I'll definitely use it. Oops. Did I just use the C-word? Well, there's that as well.Anyway for now, I'm fine, thanks."},
{"title": "Posthumanism: \"Avatar\" and Cyborg Multitasking", "date": "Sunday, December 27, 2009", "text": "This journal entry may get a little weird, even for me. Fair warning.I've not seen the movie \"Avatar\". I'm sure I will, and since it is in 3-D, I suspect I must see it at an IMAX theater. I've read the reviews, plot summaries, and spoilers, so I know what it is about. I also know that this is not a new concept. In fact, word has it that James Cameron ripped off the plot from a Poul Anderson 1957 novella entitled \"Call Me Joe\". This would not surprise me, as a writer named Harlan Ellison had a similar issue with Cameron over the movie \"Terminator\". Hey, that's Hollywood for you.Anderson wrote a story about a paraplegic who telepathically connects with an artificially created life form in order to explore the harsh terrain of the planet Jupiter. So, a little on the clunky and out-of-date, but you get the picture. The theme to be briefly explored in this entry is all the different man-machine interfaces and combinations that we can expect.Today, we already have cyborgs among us. If you consider anyone with a mechanical part implanted in, or supplementing, a human body as part of the category of  \"cyborg\", then there are literally billions of cyborgs on the planet. Not just the ones with the cool computerized limbs, but the ones with hip replacements, peg legs, dentures, or bridgework would be considered as such. I wouldn't stretch the fuzzy boundaries of the category to include them. My definition of \"cyborg\" would be that there must be some type of direct brain/machine connection. The connection itself really doesn't matter much. It could be direct nerve ending connection as are used in today's computerized limbs. It could be a bioelectrical interface within the brain itself, such as an implanted chip. Or it could be through the EEG brain scanning helmets or beanies currently being developed to \"read your thoughts\". The point is, cyborgs walk among us. Today. Courtesy, primarily, of the Department of Mad Scientists, or DARPA. (As described in Michael Belfiore's book in the preceding link). Many veterans, particularly from the current wars, who have had limbs blown off, are outfitted with computerized robotic limbs. There is every indication that these limbs will become better, faster, stronger than the ones evolution has graced us with. In many cases, the body is being modified to accommodate the robot parts. Amputees are getting surgeries so that their motor signals are more readily understood by their myoelectric arms and legs. It won't stop there. As Belfiore recounts in an interview with an Iraq war vet, whether his new hand could manipulate a computer mouse. The vet responded \"Why do I need a mouse? Why can't I just plug my arm into a USB port?\" Indeed. And why stop there? Why not go wireless?Which is where we are going. Once you can control things wirelessly, there's no reason for it to be attached to your body. Remotely piloted vehicles are the logical next step, with the ultimate version (at least in Cameron's very expensive but quite limited vision) being the movie \"Avatar\", in which you operate a remote body. You shouldn't have to pilot your remote. You shouldn't even wear it. You should be it. This much is obvious, even back in 1957.If you are going to be a cyborg,  you should not have to multitask. (Besides, studies have shown that we humans are absolutely terrible at multitasking. Better to leave multitasking to computers that are much better at it). So, your limbs, or your body, or your remote, should be sophisticated enough to handle not only the minute-to-minute status and maintenance of the robotic parts, but the uplink/download interfaces with the biological portion. This will happen. Technology advances, robotic limbs and remotes will get \"smarter\" and more sophisticated. Or at least, like chess games, they will have increasingly clever algorithms and sufficient processing power and memory to brute force their way through most intractable problems. Certainly not the way we (non-cyborgs) think, but it works, as a chess player will attest to in a contest with a computer. In fact, there is no reason not to supplement our brains as well. We end up with a biological part of a cyborg that is not so much controlling its mechanical parts, as having a conversation with them.In fact, it makes sense to keep these doofus human brains of ours as much out of the loop as possible. Use the brains for what they are good for, which seems to be informed decision based upon experience. Much the same as our own brains have two decision paths: one through the old reptilian brain that is instinctive and lightning fast, and the other through the neocortex which is a bit more thoughtful and considered. One wonders then where does the person end and the machine begin? Or is that a dumb question? And the answer is, dumb question.Because here is a weird thing about our funny big brains. We are quite adaptable at reconfiguring our identities. When we drive a car, we don't so much drive the car, as become the car. The question is how far can the adaptation go? Its easy enough to operate a humanoid body with four limbs and a head. One equipped with a standard sensorium similar to our own. But what about operating a body more suited to the environment to be explored or lived in, such as the bottom of the ocean, or deep space? How well would we handle \"being\", say, an octopus underwater? Or a shark? Or a swarm of bees? Or an alien? Could we handle it? Or would it drive us crazy? Embodied minds is what we are. We are informed and limited by our forms. It makes sense our minds are shaped by our bodies.How far can we go? How long can we remain this way? There is a story of a magician who could transform himself into any animal. He especially enjoyed becoming a bear and, over time, as he spent more and more time as a bear, he lost himself, and became less and less a man. This is obviously a cautionary tale, but honestly, if you've become a cyborg, is there any reason to go back to being a human? Or if you've \"become\" a cyborg (by operating a remote for a sufficient time), would you want to go back?Could this one way that humans end? This is often referred to as the complacent posthuman apocalypse (well... it is what I often refer to). We, for one reason or another, are all changed so gradually we don't notice it. Before you know it, you can't find anyone who isn't changed. Could be. It might end up being a generational thing. We already seem to be distressed by this, as the younger ones become more accustomed to, and intuitive of, advanced technologies.Well, here's my prediction. I've no doubt that the brain scan technology will continue to improve. Within, say, seven to ten years, \"telepathy beanies\" will be available on the market. Not only will the kids be \"talking behind your back\", they'll be running things with their brains. Creepy, huh? And I have no idea what the step after that will be."},
{"title": "It's the Oceans, Stupid", "date": "Tuesday, December 22, 2009", "text": "I don't get cable. Since I'm back in Indiana, I'm able to watch cable. And here's my question.What the hell is wrong with the Discovery Channel?Industrial fishing shows. Clear cut logging shows. What's next? Strip mining shows? African bush meat shows? A Christmas special on baby seal bashing? I guess their revenue is way down.  And, so, they need to show everything that is wrong with the commercial fishing industry and then glorify it. Hey, here's some questions. Can you see the Great Wall of China from space? The Pyramids? The U.S.'s Interstate highway system? Answers: Nope. Sometimes. Nope. What manmade thing can you see from space? Net fishing. Bottom dredging drag nets scraping the ocean floor clean. Picture a Force Ten tornado with a kill path miles across, and when it sweeps over your house, it drags everything with it, scrapes right down to the top soil and nothing, and I mean nothing, will grow back for decades to come. Meanwhile, hapless you and your scrawny, underaged loved ones become \"bycatch\", because there's no money in you, so back you go, falling to earth with a sickening thud. \"Bycatch\". What a weasel word. It's, oh dear,  collateral damage, can't be helped, dumped back into the sea obviously dead as hell despite the narrator's assurances to the contrary. Hey, I got your Deadliest Catch. I got your long-line fishing. Let's kill everything we can dredge up or hook, including juvenile endangered fish species. Meanwhile, Discovery puts on a show called Whale Wars, which bemoans the fate of un-endangered species of whales. Whales that, under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whales, established on Dec. 2, 1946, are perfectly legal to be slaughtered by signatory nations. Committees decide how many whales of what species may be hunted, in what numbers, and real numbers are tracked as to how many have actually been hunted. Data on their decisions  (whale kill quotas, and whale kill numbers) is public information. I mean, since the establishment of the Convention, not a single species of whale has become extinct. In fact, their populations have increased. It may not sound particularly Green, but the thing is, it WORKS. As a matter of fact, every international agreement, from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (1973, in the works since before Earth Day), to other environmental solutions such as the 1987 banning of ozone-depleting substances has worked. And for two reasons: 1) Rather than shaking a finger and saying \"Bad Power Mad Greedy Corporate Destructors!\" it recognizes that activities we don't like are not going to disappear because we don't like them. And the process of demonizing doesn't stop the Bad Guys. But, ah, amazing, these activities can be regulated, and willing partners on the exploitation side can be found to cooperate, and  2) If these activities - and the people behind them - are made public, scrutinized, verified (so that they CAN be regulated), they can be controlled. And the good thing, the whole environmentalist/conservationist goal can be achieved.Sorry, Greenpeace. Sorry, Whale Wars. You aren't saving whales. In fact, you aren't really doing much of anything except getting in the way of - and giving a bad name to - serious, thoughtful, REAL environmentalists. And who are these real environmentalists? Typically, marine biologists, that's who. Understaffed, underpaid, underresourced, dull, boring, dorky scientists. Not sexy, rugged fishermen, or activist buffoons in Zodiac boats, but scientists. Scientists like people from the University of Halifax, that predicted the collapse of the Atlantic cod fisheries. Scientists that are constantly ignored by the faceless directors - unknown and unaccountable to the public - of Fishing , Inc. Ignored because the data biologists present does not match the Fish Catch Model. And what is the Model? Know one knows. It's a black box. It's known only to the faceless bureaucrats of, you guessed it, Fishing, Inc. And so the biologists collect their data, and publish their findings, write \"crazy papers\". Crazy papers that now predict the collapse of the entire world's fisheries by perhaps as early as 2048.But you know, that's just bummer news. No TV revenue in stuff like that. And the viewing public is tired of all the sky is falling stuff anyway. Let 'em watch commie pinko public TV for that. They've got that demographic sewed up."},

And I had entered about a paragraph's worth of, well, in retrospect, bullshit rationalizations about my belief system (or lack of), when I suddenly had a desperate urge to take a shit.Hey, it happens.So, just so you are aware, the college is closed down for Winter Break. This is absolute bliss for me, as I have the studio all to myself. I'll be able to cast metal, or cut wood, or weld, or whatever, without the distraction and interruption of the faculty and students. I mean, it really is great, being alone for a change.So, in I head to the bathroom, get business taken care of, and fortunately it is a healthy bowel movement and none too messy. (And I know you all wanted to know about all that). So I reach for some toilet paper... and there is none there. Okay, fine. No reason to panic. So I frog-walk myself to the next stall, pants and undies around my ankles. No paper there either. Duck waddle on to the next stall... and the next stall. Last stall. Nothing. What the fuck?Sigh. Alright, fine. I saw paper towels in the dispenser. I take a leisurely short-strided stroll over to the sinks, crank out two heaping fistfuls of paper towels, and return like a hermit crab to my fortress of solitude.Now, I'm not sure which paper company the college is buying their stuff from, but I'd wager it is a factory formerly behind the Iron Curtain. I say this, because the whole heinie-cleanup endeavor is a tad on the scratchy side.Well, guess what? I didn't grab enough towels. So, I venture out once again, and there is the janitor standing there. I look up at him, pants around the ankles, bare butt sticking out.\"Hey, how ya doin?\"He nods. I grab more paper towels. Head back to base. Get myself all taken care of. Walk out standing tall.

{"title": "Communist as Hell!", "date": "Thursday, December 17, 2009", "text": "First off, at the risk of a little wrath from the girlfriend, I'm sending out a electronic bear hug to Magaly Guerrero for promoting me. If it is one of my usual bear hugs, you all should probably hear this hot little chili pepper's spine cracking, as the 4th and 5th thoracic vertebrae separate and pop - but in a good way.That very pleasant chore accomplished, on with the griping!One of the inside jokes of my family is the expression \"Communist as Hell!\", which my nephew has shortened to \"Communist!\", and summed up, or distilled down, parsing down the whole variety of levels of meanings, it basically means \"Bullshit!\", as in dishonest bullshit. And more specifically dishonest bullshit that looks good on paper, looks good theoretically (thus the Commie reference), but in a dialectically opposite Capitalist way, on the way to reifying it, corners are cut, quality is abandoned, and you end up with some cobbled together Soviet abortion that (again, weird) only unsupervised private enterprise could create. (Because as ugly and cobbled together as the Soviet thing is, it's still pretty damn sturdy and reliable, like an AK-47, and not like the usual shoddy piece of shit that only a cost-cutting bloated plutocratic capitalist running-dog would sell in a place like Walmart). So, it's a paradoxical phrase, which is why its an inside joke.In my family, given that we are all, in one form or another, scientists, engineers, hard-nose materialist types who would rather be confronted with the unvarnished truth, warts and all, instead of convenient fictions, we like to cut through the bullshit.  As such, we, all of us, have, among other things, an immense distaste for lawyers on TV. They ain't honest.To quote Joe Pesci's character in \"My Cousin Vinnie\", when speaking of the D.A. building his case, like building a house from bricks, the bricks... \"When you look at the bricks from the right angle, they're as thin as this playing card. His whole case is an illusion, a magic trick\".Legal arguments, generally, ain't honest. They ain't honest because you don't get all the facts. Just the facts they want you to know about. That's called cherry-picking. I see it every damn day, and it is, yes indeed, Communist As Hell!This whole thing started up with my morning coffee, flipping through the channels, and I happen to catch John Stossel on Fox News*. Actually, it's not even about him. It's really any entertainer out there (and every political commentator of every stripe, my dears, is an entertainer, from people with giant quivering manboobs, like Michael Moore or Rush Limbaugh, to slightly more fit physical types with mustaches, like John Stossel or Janeane Garofolo, or whomever) that is Communist as Hell, because they are trying to get their point across in the shortest - and therefore most dishonest - sound bite that they can.So Stossel is yapping away about how the government can't do shit right. Let's ignore the fact that I would not even be hearing his broadcast if it were not for the liberal largesse of the US government. He uses the example of how the East German government couldn't build a car, and as a result, we can't trust our government to do anything.What the fuck? Stossel, do you really think I'm that fucking stupid without my coffee in the morning?Stossel, would you trust private enterprise to successfully complete the Manhattan Project? To put a man on the moon? To build a national interstate system? To build an Internet? Aside from the fact that your average business hack lacks the vision to see any money coming out of these projects, and don't have nearly enough funds to do it, he's just far too wimpy to accept the risk!I mean, the US government is Communist as Hell - but, for the most part, in a good way. And in a very selective way. The telegraph (and by extension our entire communication infrastructure)? Funded by Congress. (Look it up!) The research and development monies that went into the invention of the transistor? Computer chips? The personal computer? No, they weren't cobbled together in someone garage. The components were. But the components would not exist unless they had been funded by Congress. The Internet? Ever hear of DARPA? You wouldn't be reading me without their (your) monies.Lasers? Radio? TV? Flat screen TV? Want to guess? In fact, one of the most spectacularly successful programs for technological innovation has been provided to you, with your taxpayer dollars, by the US government. We The People (through the instrument of the federal government) have given (free) most of the land west of the Mississippi to corporations. (Look up the Railroad Acts, starting with Comrade Commissar Lincoln). We killed off or corralled all the Indians, to make it safe to settle. We build dams to water the wasteland, and then let farmers take it Free of Charge. We electrified the countryside (for Free, Fucking FREE!). And (okay this is gruesome weird) We built a Bomb that kept probably 2 million men from dying on the beaches of Japan. We embarked on a period of exploration that turned blurry spots of light into vast new worlds (NASA). And when you consider that, since 2004, Hollywood's annual budget for making movies surpassed that of NASA's, should you be just a little pissed off? I mean, sure, NASA crashes a 200 million dollar satellite into Mars, but no one pitches a bitch about Waterworld?We the People have done a lot of Commie shit, and a lot of it has not been Communist as Hell!Hey Stossel? Shut the fuck up you Commie bastard!* To be fair, Stossel was complaining about the current Senate version of the healthcare reform bill. I agree with him that it is just a wet, slimy turd slick of a bill. But we disagree as to why it sucks, and I still was not happy that he still had to make a dishonest argument about why he thought it sucked!"},
{"title": "Going Postal? Not..quite..yet...", "date": "Wednesday, December 16, 2009", "text": "I figured I'd do a quick followup to the last journal entry. For some reason, my girlfriend reads my musings, and on occasion, she has commented that, considering how nice of guy I am, where does all the venom come from? Venom? I'm trying to be smart and funny here you bitch! And sometimes smart and funny crosses over into dangerous territory (oops, like probably in that last sentence). But you know, I've always tried to maintain a No Sacred Cows rule in my attempts at humor, and so there you go.But now let's say there is someone out there that read the prior entry, and they say, \"Geez, John. I'm a climate skeptic. Way to go with the diplomatic approach by calling me a dangerously stupid asshole! Way to provide a reasoned rebuttal that will convince me otherwise\". To which I reply, \"Oh, shut the fuck up, you whiner\". But hey, some of my best friends are climate skeptics, and I regularly call them dangerously stupid assholes. Actually, far worse stuff than that depending upon how much we've had to drink. If they are not offended, and I do not worry about it, why should I care if you, a perfect stranger, are offended?And besides, I've found, philosophically at least, that one cannot reason a person out of a belief.I've given up on that. I learned my Internet debate lesson a long time ago. And so now, for the most part, I instead poke fun at you and your rhetoric. (It is also why I have kind of given up on watching presidential debates, as there is no attempt at reasoned discourse or critical evaluation, but mere parroting of party ideological positions and well-marketed sound bites. Like Frank Zappa once said \"Politics is the entertainment branch of industry\").So then, the second thing a climate skeptic might say (if they had a very, very brief moment of clarity), would be \"Okay. Suppose you are right. What then?\" Whoa! Hit me with a stun-hammer! You really want to discuss this? Okay. Well, then I suppose we need to ask the question \"Why am I not an equally dangerously stupid asshole?\"It's question worth asking. The question, more properly phrased, is What Am I Doing About It? And the answer, honestly, is Not Much Dude. I, like pretty much all my fellow Americans, am busy making the problem even worse. I'm not changing my behavior. In fact, in my case, my carbon footprint - since I burn LOTS of natural gas to melt metal for casting sculptures - is more like a carbon buttprint.So, I suppose I'm an asshole as well. Just not nearly as dangerously stupid as you.But I'm trying in my own way. I'm encouraging my farming friends back in Indiana to cultivate terra preta which not only conserves soil, but sequesters carbon. I'm glad to see China is kicking our ass in green technologies, and shame anyone that can make a difference into noticing. I write emails to my butthead congress and hope that my president will grow a sack and take some action. And when I do write, I stress, more than anything, that Its The Oceans, Stupid. And fundamentally, I'm an optimist, but a practical one.  I'm not expecting human ingenuity to make things right. I'm not expecting some hi-tech miracle to be pulled out of our collective ass. I'm not expecting Everybody to start making Nice-Nice. I'm no goo-goo-eyed wobblehead.And I don't buy into the whole Save the Planet bullshit. The planet, quite obviously, can take care of itself. She's a tough old 4 billion year old monster bitch, with guts of molten iron, and a rock hard hide. Life has made it through plenty bad time, ranging from the Snowball Earth world glaciation events of two billion years ago, to the Great Dying of the Permian Extinction (nightmare global warming) of 250 million years ago, to the cometary greeting card the dinosaurs got 65 million years ago. And this is only the nasty shit we know about. The Old Bitch may have gone through far, far worse. But one thing is for sure - and you really, really need to get this through your head -  We Need Her, but She Don't Need Us. So I have to be resolutely hopeful that we can change our ways. This hope of mine, it's a belief, true. But it is a belief I have to keep at the core of my life. We do have the capacity to learn from the past, to recognize when we are fucking things up for ourselves, to realize when we are taking a shit in our own kitchen. There is a \"sculpture wall\" installed in an out-of-the-way section of the wood shop, here at the college where I work. The wall is set up to look like your standard gallery white wall, and students will document (photograph) their finished projects with this as a professional backdrop.When I opened the studio this morning, someone had left up a wall-mounted ceramics piece from the previous night's \"documentation session\". In the dim light, it looked like a giant buttocks, a big 'ol butt on the wall. And when I turned on lights, it was definitely a big fat pair of butt cheeks, but with  these little hemorrhoidal Leggo connector pegs interspersed within the butt crack. (Yeah, ick). This just made it all the more repulsive, and knowing that it was a fat-assed, unpleasant, illogically egotistical cow of a woman who had made the piece did improve the association.This often happens with abstracted objects. There is an unfortunate lack of thought as to what the object may resemble. And more often than not, a negative connotation is formed.I remember one time, a kid was making an abstracted object out of stone, and while he was contemplating it, I mentioned \"Hey, wow. That looks like a big old dick\".\"No, it doesn't!\"\"Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's a dick. Come here. Look at it from here\".\"No! It.. it's suppos-, I-... aww sheeit!\"Ah, well, So it goes. Some things start out as one thing and end up another. Some things have one meaning, and, confused or conflated with something else, end up with a completely different take, in  a process called pejoration (taking on negative connotations).Examples. Cock. Pussy. Uranus. Penal colony. Ejaculate.  (A rooster. A cat. A planet. A prison. An excited verbal exclamation.)How about the word \"skeptic\". It's been on a long, slow pejorative slide for some time. Originally imbued with the positive meaning of \"investigator\", towards the less positive connotation of \"doubter\" (but still, concerned with evidence rather than belief), then finally \"nonbeliever\", or, as in the phrase \"climate skeptic\" dangerously stupid asshole. You know, I have four categories of stupid. No 1) is developmentally challenged, as in not enough processing power, and those in this category get a break. No 2) is ignorant, as in hasn't been provided or has been denied the facts, and those in this category get a break as well. No 3) is just plain stupid, as in, they got the brains, they got the information, but they just can't seem to make connections, and usually I will cut them some slack, until I realize there is no way they are going to get it, and then I just have to say \"Out of the way so I can get the job done, stupid\". And No 4)... No 4) is dangerously stupid. They got the information, they can process the information, they can put 2 + 2 together, but they willfully ignore the conclusions or consequences because it does not fit into their worldview, or will seriously inconvenience their lifestyle, or will compromise the lofty view of themselves that they so illogically possess. These people, if I had my way, would be landfill. There is really nothing else to be done with them.And I am of the opinion that climate skeptics are dangerously stupid. They may think they are in the right, but if so, why the need to cherry-pick data, by presenting, for example, long discredited scientific papers as current science? Why the need to twist numbers to match their conclusions? Why the need to lie? Which is, of course, what I've seen on every single climate skeptic site, provided they actually have anything like charts or data. Most of the time, it's simply a generalized dismissal, such as \"All that global warming stuff is a bunch of hooey, so there!\" The current silliness about Climategate (hah!) certainly does nothing to discredit the nearly century of work on the subject, any more than finding someone was wrong about today's weather means you can't trust their opinion on anything! What an absurd form of reasoning.Fact of the matter is this. We, as a species, move more earth and stone than the largest rivers. We farm a land area equal to the entire South American continent. (Look it up!) We've increased the acidity of the entire global ocean by creating carbonic acid from carbon emissions (from a global average of pH of 8 to a pH of 7.7 - and pH scale is logarithmic). (Look it up!) We haven't quite turned the world's oceans into vinegar yet, but give us time. Glaciers, and the arctic ice cap are shrinking and melting (and someone tell me how they can melt if the earth is getting cooler as the skeptics would have us believe?) Even the Antarctic continent, for all practical purposes cut off from the rest of the world's weather systems, is being effected by the heat. That's a big thing, when a continent cut off from global winds and current by an insulation of miles of ice is still perturbed. (Oh, sure, the skeptics will tell you that the eastern Antarctic ice cap is increasing, and it is. This is because there is more precipitation in the form of snow, and it only snows down there when water gets a chance to evaporate, which requires heat). I could go on and on, but there are better websites that document all of this, and I'm close to frothing at the mouth on this.Skeptics? Skeptics? Come one, you fucking stupids.  We are a Force of Nature now. Time to grow up and act like one."},
{"title": "What If Hitler Knocked?", "date": "Tuesday, December 15, 2009", "text": "There's a literary movement, or genre, or fad,  that has picked up steam in recent decades called Alternative Fiction. Actually the genre has been around for quite some time in the form of What If stories. The first time I came across the current version of AF was a book by the Reigning King of AF (in that he just keeps churning out AF novels like a sausage factory), Harry Turtledove, called the Guns of the South. It was a What If the South Won the Civil War story, or more technically, What Would It Take For the South to Win The Civil War story? And the answer to that is: It would have taken a Fucking Miracle, (when you think how the North did practically everything it could to lose the war, and still managed to Fuck Things Up and win it).And so Turtledove had to resort to Time Travel to make it all happen. Intervention From The Future. (Kind of like how Governor Schwarzenegger, so I'm told,  is currently building a killer robot to send back in time to kill the mother of his campaign manager so that he is not elected Governor).Now, Time Travel is guaranteed to mess with you head. There is just no way to resolve the paradoxes involved - unless you invoke bizarre topics like multiple universes, or self-similar causality. Even guys like Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne, or Kurt Godel, or Albert Einstein, would tell you that the subject will just plain gizoogle your shiznit. Better to stick to a safe wank of a subject like AF.And of course, AF is basically a public wank. There is really no useful purpose for it, not even from a counterfactual analysis of history standpoint. Because, quite simply, the whole saying of how \"Hindsight is 20-20\" is just pure horsehsit. Nothing is EVER clear. Nothing is EVER, EVER certain, regardless of past-ness, or present-ness, or future-ness. So, really, just shut the fuck up about all that.Anyway, here's my AF contribution, which I never wrote out until now, called What If Hitler Knocked.Hitler wanted to be an artist. He was rejected twice from entering the Vienna Art Academy, due to a \"lack of talent\". His drawings and paintings were considered stiff and lifeless. However, a friend suggested he apply for a job doing set design at the Vienna Opera House. Hitler showed up for the job appointment, but at the last instant, in a nervous moment of low self-esteem, just at the doors of the theater, turned and left without being interviewed.Had he knocked, had he taken the interview, he would have gotten the job. Not only would he have gotten the job, he would have been quite successful at it. Because it would turn out that he had quite the talent for pageantry and spectacle. Over time, throughout the 30s, he worked his way up the ladder, with no end of glowing reviews of his shows. He caught the eye of Hollywood producers, and was enticed join Warner Brothers studios in 1934. In California, he directed and eventually produced movies that rivaled anything by Busby Berkeley (a \"close personal friend\"). He became a citizen of the United States at the outbreak of the War, and directed many patriotic tributes throughout the hostilities. He even directed a hilarious sendup of the Third Reich starring the Three Stooges, with Moe as Der Fuhrer Heinrich Giesel. He continued to produce movies up until his death from a stroke, at his Beverly Hills mansion in 1956. The End.The point? Not so much about destiny, or inevitability. Possibly a thought along the lines that evil is situational, and that perhaps freedom of choice is limited by information, and that someone who is all-knowing may have no free will at all?Nah. Nothing so heavy. Its just my little public wank.Here's a hankie!"},

{"title": "Whole Leg Orgasms", "date": "Wednesday, December 9, 2009", "text": "If you've taken a psychology or biology course, you may have seen the accompanying diagram. It is the mapping of your body onto your brain, or, in more technical terms, it is the cortical homunculus - the somatosensory representation of the body upon the surface of your cortex.The picture shows a front-on view of your brain, and how your body is mapped upon it - at least according to the first mapping published in 1950 by Wilder Penfield, and Theodore Rasmussen.Penfield produced this image by electrically stimulating the naked cortex of patient's brains. Not for kicks, mind you, but to identify what-was-connected-to-what prior to surgery. So that he knew what parts of the brain he could and could not muck about with.You may have noticed, for the sake of modesty, that the genitals are not displayed. And, according to Penfield and Rasmussen, the genitals are not located where you would think they would be (at the pelvis) but just below the toes!Foot fetish anyone?Even more interesting, subsequent research by Vilanyur Ramachandran, in his book \"Phantoms of the Brain\", has described peculiar cases of amputees who have lost legs. The cortical area which formerly processed input from the feet and toes were taken over by the genitalia. In other words, all the little neurons that used to process sensations from the feet were co-opted to process sensations from the genitalia. Even more interesting, such amputees would often experience the pleasure of an orgasm not just in their naughty bits, but in their toes, feet and sometimes the whole leg! Subsequent investigations, in such papers with such erotic titles as \"Sensory Cortical Representation of the Human Penis: Revisiting Somatotopy in the Male Homunculus\", indicates that the sensory areas are actually spread out over different areas of the brain, and that the main sensory location for the penis actually lies laterally next to the big toe (not below it).Something to explore in your off-hours, I suppose."},
{"title": "\"Plan A\"", "date": "Tuesday, December 8, 2009", "text": "Spent the weekend Back Home in Indiana, introducing the girlfriend to friends and family. Everyone liked her, and on at least three occasions I was advised: \"Don't Fuck It Up\" Wha?  I always get melancholy after these visits, as it makes me realize how much I miss my tribe. And, of course, the old family stories come out, which are invariably funny and sweet, but leave a bittersweet aftertaste. Take the stories we told about my father, for example. My dad, Bill Kurman, was just one hell of a bull of a guy. Bill... Dad was of the WWII generation. Born in the 20s. Orphaned young and raised by an aunt during the Depression, he had a hard scrabble life. Served aboard an LST as a signalman in the South Pacific during the War. (LST stands for Landing Ship Tank, one of those ships that sails up to the beach and drops off trucks and tanks and such. In Navy parlance, LST stands for Large Slow Target). Afterwards, he went to college, met and married Mom, had four boys, worked as a salesman, and died of a heart attack way, way too early at the age of 57, in 1983. As a joke, he liked to pose wearing this really bad toupee, or his cheesy plastic Colonel Klink helmet, you know, the one with the spike on top the Krauts wore back in WWI.I could, like most people, probably generate a novella out of all the Dad stories. So here's a couple samples:I remember talking to my brother Chris about Dad's habit of starting off a planning session with the phrase \"Plan A\". I mentioned to him, \"Ever notice there was never a Plan B?\" \"...yeah! What was that about?\"\"Well, I figure the Old Kraut was displaying his cultural roots. Either Plan A succeeded gloriously, or, or... it if did not, then... Vee Vill Neffer Shpeek Huf Zis Agane!\" Here's another. He made a habit of not swearing. He considered the practice  uncouth and ungentlemanly, and I suppose my form of rebellion is to cuss like a longshoreman, both in speech and in print. His most common emphatic expression was  \"Dog it!\" And on only three occasions did I hear him use curse words. Given the recent date of Dec. 7th, I relate this. I can recall one time when we were watching Victory at Sea on public TV, which was a documentary on the War in the Pacific. My father never once mentioned that he saw any action. He did once say that the entire experience aboard ship was pretty much constant boredom. We were watching footage of Japanese kamikaze planes, and the Old man muttered, just barely heard by me, \"Fucking kamikazes\". Much later, after he had died, and we were going through his things, we found three Battle Star ribbons. A little research turned up that his ship had engaged in the Battle of Okinawa Gunto, which was the heaviest, or second heaviest, kamikaze raid of the war. Well, the Old Man's combat station was anti-aircraft gunner. It was pretty much guaranteed he had fired shots in anger, and experienced those briefs moments of \"horror interspersed with boredom\" that veterans will speak of. But, like most vets who had actually seen action, saw no point in relating the experience. Really nothing much of a surprise.I remember - long before hippies had been invented - he and friends of his generation, would say goodbye with the word \"Peace\". Unlike the hippies, I think they understood what that word actually meant.   Peace."},
{"title": "Life On Man", "date": "Friday, December 4, 2009", "text": "Well, day two of applying ear drops for a dewaxing, and I am officially Stone Deaf. I kind of wanted to write about Wilder Penfield, the cortical homunculus, and whole leg orgasms today, but my mind is still stuck on ear wax. Why do we even have the stuff? Well, the answer is obvious. Same reason we have dandruff, and grease, and snot, and other gross exudations. Our external integument (skin, hair, tongue, cheeks, guts, etc.) oozes stuff, and also slags off to keep creepy little parasites from establishing a beachhead. Finding an anchorage from which to push into our lush bodily continents, like little Conquistadors intent on finding gold and slaves.If you view the human body as a planet, then it has all sorts of biomes upon and within it, small ecological zones populated by microbes both good and bad. The gut, obviously, is the rich and opulent rain forest zone, teeming with life. The ear canal, on the other hand, is a veritable Sahara, devoid of life. And rightly so, for such an inviting place, dark and moist, a seeming fertile ground for molds and mildews, really needs some type of protective film. And so, to the surprise and occasional disgust of some, we are indeed vast worlds filled with creatures. For every one human cell, there are perhaps ten or more microbial inhabitants. The majority are, if not beneficial, at least neutral, and generally keep more nasty germs at bay by merely being on and upon us. In fact, were we completely sterilized,  we would probably perish, or at least, not thrive.Soon after the Human Genome Project was complete, the Human Microbiome Project cranked into high gear. Results are pouring in as we speak, and it is worth doing a cursory google search, just to see what's going in - considering how intimate the whole relationship is.Human cells outnumbered ten to one? Oh dear! But don't worry. I once read that the average bacterial cell is about fifteen times smaller by volume than a human cell. I once figured out that, if a human cell were the size of a trailer park trailer, then the average bacterium would be the size of a person.Perhaps that explains why, once, during a fever dream, I was heard to exclaim: \"Get out of my trailer!\""},
{"title": "Unintelligent Design", "date": "Thursday, December 3, 2009", "text": "Had my annual physical at the doctor's yesterday. Passed, of course, with flying colors, seeing as I am a Viking type bull-of-a-man and all the weaklings in our line bred out - left to die exposed on the ice floes and along the glacier line quite some time ago I suspect. (Ah, yes, we of the Kurman Nation are well known for our humility).Nevertheless, a superior physical specimen such as myself does still have complaints. Specifically, I had trouble hearing out of my right ear, and would occasionally get trapped water in there. My curmudgeon of a doctor stuck his lighted ear inspection tool in there and exclaimed: \"Jeez, I can't even see your ear drum\"!Chockfull of ear wax I am, and the left ear not much better. So, he gets out the giant metal syringe to flush the wax out - and succeeds in completely plugging up my ear canal. Nothing for it but to take ear drops the next few days to soften the wax, then go back for a proper flushing. In the meantime, I am, like, \"What? What?\" to everyone around me, dude.But it got me thinking about design flaws, and how we poor shambling humans seem to have quite a few flaws in our design. Consider: The prostate. Not the best positioning, don't you think? Guys get older, prostate swells up, gets hard to pee, not good. Couldn't there have been a better place to put the thing?Knees, hips, backs. Not quite the optimal design for bipedal locomotion.The blind spot in the eye. Not to mention the flimsy connection of the retina makes you think it was manufactured in Bangladesh. A good slap on the back, and the retina detaches. And not covered by warranty.Ectopic pregnancy. The egg becomes attached to cervix, fallopian tube, or even the ovary, rather than the uterus. Really nothing humorous at all about this as it usually results in death to both the mother and child. Good thing abortion is an available procedure.While we are on it, something should be done about the size of the birth canal. Breech births are not an optimal method.Hernias. Men's testicles descend from the abdomen, leaving a weak spot in the muscles. Prior to current surgical methods, hernias could result in gangrene, followed by death.Congenital Diseases. Scoliosis. Sciatica. Wisdom teeth. Scurvy, due to our unique inability to manufacture Vitamin C. The descent of the pharynx within the throat, making Man the only animal that can choke. Most embarrassingly, sometimes on his own vomit.  Well, the  list goes on, and on, and on. I'm not trying to shake anyone's personal belief structure - not too much anyway. But I am suggesting that maybe those who buy into Intelligent Design should occasionally allow themselves to be confused with the facts?"},
{"title": "Reason Iz Stoopid", "date": "Tuesday, December 1, 2009", "text": "\"Our logic is to be illogical. That is our advantage\"Oh yeah. I'm a geek. Although I'm a little embarrassed about it, I'm told by, uh, this Really Hot Mom* that I'm going out with, that there is something very sexy about geeking out. It's decidedly childish, but also childlike. I figure women find it a cute thing about men: that we don't ever actually completely grow up. I think this is one reason why women keep us around - at least until A Real Mandroid(TM),  the mind-reading love robot, with the kung-fu grip, is perfected and put on the market. Anyways...The entitled quote is from Star Trek. Specifically, an episode entitled \"I, Mudd\" wherein Captain Kirk is speaking to an android named Norman, in still another demonstration of how us illogical humans can outwit logical computers. (And just so know, I had to google this. I'm not nearly as much as a geek as I let on).  Well, the point of all this is the following statement: \"Logic ain't all it's cracked up to be\". Case in point. There was a science news article back in July of aught-nine entitled \"Ants Are More Rational Than Humans\".As the article states, it is not that ants are smarter than humans, but that humans simply make more irrational decisions when faced with complex challenges. This has also been investigated by economists Kahneman and Tversky (look 'em up). And I would argue that ants are dumb, which is why they are more rational.Another case in point. For the longest time, computer scientists thought that building intelligent computers would be a piece of cake. All they had to do was apply the Brute Force approach of supplying enough memory banks and processing chips, and Logic would do the rest. As it turned out, it was all a big disappointment, and Artificial Intelligence was a lot harder problem than they realized.Worse still, back in 1997, IBM build a computer called Deep Blue. Deep Blue beat the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, and it really messed with his head. At one point in the game, Deep Blue passed up a logical move of capturing Garry's piece for immediate advantage, in order to press a more risky strategy to win the game. Kasparov got paranoid, convinced that he was playing a human opponent disguised as a computer. As I said, it messed with his head. Now, I personally don't think much of chess. It isn't that I suck at the game, which I do. It's because it really is just a stupid wasteful medieval battle of attrition. One in which any modern general would probably be court-martialed for slaughtering so many of his own men. And playing the game is more a matter of having a good memory than using logical skills. But nevertheless, there is a step-by-step linear method of logic involved. And look how easy it was for a dumb (yes, dumb as a turd, by animal standards) computer to kick human ass.Ah, but put Deep Blue in the awkward social position of going to a barbeque in your backyard, and you quickly realize how much of a dumbshit it is. We, without consciously thinking about it, recognize everything in the backyard. We recognize bushes, and grass, and patios, and pets, and charcoal grills without a second thought. And really, it takes quite a bit of computer processing time (not that that's what we do) to do all of this in our little pumpkin heads. And no matter how much logical processing time it devotes to it, poor old Deep Blue just ain't gonna cut it as life of the party at your Bar-B-Q.In other words, it takes more raw intelligence to visually recognize a chess board than it does to play the game. It takes more raw intelligence to inhabit and navigate a body, than it does to do calculus, or compute orbital trajectories, or model climate change, or win at a mathematical game like the Prisoner's Dilemma.So, let's talk about that so we can get to the friggin' point. You got two crooks that get caught by the cops. Detectives interrogate them in separate cells. The cops need a confession  or they have to let the crooks go. They tell 'em \"Rat on your buddy, and it will go easy on you\". Each crook has a choice. Turn rat fink, or clam up. Mathematically, there are four outcomes with expected payoffs: Both crooks rat, one rats on the other, or the other rats, or both clam up. Mathematically, logically, it can be proven that the logical choice is to rat. But the irrational choice, which also has the highest payoff since the crooks go free, is to clam up. In other words, they can logically compete, or they can illogically cooperate.Guess what humans usually do, not just in this game, but in other games, including economic games? They choose to behave irrationally. And it is not just humans. There is increasing evidence from ethologists - biologists who study animal behavior - that animals are more likely to cooperate than compete. It would seem that \"Nature Red in Tooth and Claw\" is not entirely the whole picture. That altruism (seen by some as irrational) has a certain logic - if you view \"survival of the fittest\" to be a group selection thingie. An individual that cooperates in the group, makes for a fitter group. And the group, in turn, provides social advantage and protection to the individual, and enhances fitness to the individual.Perhaps someone should tell the Vulcans about all this... or at least the Libertarians.UPDATE: Throw this into the category: Funny how it never rains, but it pours. The New York Times has an article out today on the evolutionary roots of altruism, titled \"We May Be Born With An Urge To Help\". Enjoy.*In my categorization of things, there is a hierarchical classification of attractive women. It goes from merely hot single young sweet things up to Hot Moms at or near my age. I suppose others would call them Cougars, but I prefer my term. I wonder if this is biological. I also wonder if, when I am an old wrinkled potato, I will find women my age that are in similar shape more  attractive, or will it not matter by then? Probably not."},
{"title": "Cunning Linguists", "date": "Monday, November 30, 2009", "text": "Oh, I know what you are thinking. You think this is going to be a cleverly disguised double entendre filled screed about a certain subject (which, if you were Irish, and practiced at home alone, might be called \"aer lingus\"). Well, you are wrong! Although, the fact that you are wrong does not preclude discussion of this really fun little topic at some later date...You know, as a science fiction, and science, and techno (non practicing) geek, I like to talk about certain things. And I've finally noticed that a common of interest of mine is origins. Why are things the way they are? We are told the activity of Science with a capital S does not cover Why questions, only How questions. But the answers to How questions usually rule out a lot of truly stupid Why questions. So, why do we speak the language we speak? Why English? Why English as it is spoken?Well, there are any number of great books on linguistics out there, and I could just parrot them. But, best if you read them yourself, if interested. John McWhorter comes to mind immediately. His book \"Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue: The Untold Story of English\" is a worthy read, and actually contains a number of informed historical suppositions that I happen to agree with (and I leave it to you, gentle reader, to read the book to find out what they are).Anthony Burgess, most famous as author of \"A Clockwork Orange\", provides informed entertainment in the books \"Language Made Plain\", and \"A Mouthful of Air\". One of those books, I can't remember which, includes a fucking wonderful treatment on the entomology and use of the word \"fuck\".Then, of course, there is the legendary Joseph Greenberg, who through typology and genetic classification, almost single-handedly traces all of our language back to that most ancient Mother Tongue spoken, perhaps, some 9,000 - 10,000 years ago, but probably much, much more ancient. His is a truly heroic performance of drudgery and tedium, in tracing common word roots. Reading Greenberg is also an excellent cure for insomnia.Genetic classification, did I say? Well, not classification, as in human genes, but as in common languages, and sometimes, by implication, common cultures. The interesting thing, though, and this may end up going on a tangent, is that there is practically no connection between language, culture, ethnicity, nationality, and your actual genetic origins. Short example? A lot of people in America speak English and are called Americans. Some of them, around 15% of the population, are African-Americans. I doubt that many of them have much in the way of English ancestry. True, you would be hard-pressed to find individuals of purely African descent. But on the whole, it is safe to say that Americans descended from individuals of the Involuntary African Diaspora could in any way say \"Oh, we're English\", the same way some people of Pilgrim stock are wont to do.  Anyway... Years ago, I participated in the National Geographic Genographic Project. I swabbed some tissue from my cheek, paid a hundred bucks, and had my DNA analyzed by them. They sent back a neat little info pack on my genetic history, and it also had a little map tracing the peregrinations of  my ancestors all the way back to our common origin in northeast Africa some 60,000-70,000 years ago. (Which makes me, technically, an African-American). The most recent branch of the human family that I belong to (going by genetic mutations) could be termed \"Northern Barbarian\" . Which is to say, that group of people who eventually settled in the Baltic area, including Northern Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway. You know, Viking types.Well, some of my distant cousins, the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, eventually moved from the southern part of Denmark over to England, and took their language and culture with them.  The original paleolithic inhabitants of the British Isles, which is to say, Irish, Welsh, Scots, and, yup, the majority of English, did not speak English. They spoke something else (possibly Celtic, although the term did not exist prior to the late 1800s, and that's another story). And then, a bit later, some of my closer cousins from Scandinavia, stopped by England for an extended stay, and changed English a bit more - simplifying the grammar, and adding some new vocabulary (like the big C-bomb word is from us Norwegians, and you are welcome). So, you Pilgrims don't even speak your own language!Of course, English is not my own either. Because we Viking types, in turn, are descendants of  the original paleolithic inhabitants who occupied Northern Europe once the glaciers departed a mere (mere!) 5,000 years ago. But English, being part of the Germanic and proto-Germanic language family, was brought into Europe along with the whole Neolithic cultural package of farming, domesticated animals, and rectangular-framed houses, by migrants from the Balkans, the Hungarian plain, and ultimately Anatolia (modern Turkey).  In fact, none of \"my\" myths and legends (Norse mythology) is my own, or at least not most of it. The olde triumvirate of Odin, Loki, Thor, are fairly recent gods of an iron-working pastoral culture. (Thor, the blacksmith with his blackened face and red, fiery eyes, Odin, the crazy wind of the bellows god, and Loki, the mischievous fire god of the forge, in case you are wondering). Well, I've lost the thread now. What was I talking about? Origins. I guess all of us, in one form or another, have lost track of our origins. But, you have to admit, it's rather amazing that linguists and folklorists have, through patience and plodding, recreated as much as we have."},
{"title": "Electronic Remediation", "date": "Friday, November 27, 2009", "text": "I'm pretty sure, back in 1978 or so, that I almost became the first \"death by cellphone\" victim. A perfectly innocent pedestrian, minding my own business, not to mention the law, crossing an intersection with the light. Suddenly, an asshole appears, intent upon inattentive driving due to talking on the cellphone. The asshole had turned right on a red light, was holding one of those \"bricks\" in one hand, was losing control of the wheel with the other, and was, all the while, I swear, narrating to the other person on the line \"Hang on a minute, I think I'm gonna hit this guy!\"\"DRIVE YOUR CAR!\" \"DROP THE FUCKING PHONE!\" \"ASSHOLE!\" I screamed at him, and stepped back out of harm's way. But he was soon gone. On his way to menace countless others. I can only hope he hit a fucking tree at some point. And also that he left no progeny.Of course, that's all pointless now, isn't it? It's a well-trodden and deeply rutted path of behavior now. Driving while electronically distracted. In fact, there are all sorts of devices that allow us to electronically mediate our way through reality now. (I once saw a woman who, along with the Ipod earphones, was also wearing silly heads-up-display virtual sunglasses and was wearing a surgical mask to avoid, what? imaginary germs I guess, since the mask clearly would not stop viruses like swine flue). \"Pretty much close to having all her holes plugged up soon\", I commented to myself. And why not? Judging by her pissy demeanor, she no doubt needed 'em all well plugged up.And now, we can avoid all of the distastefully laborious chores in our lives that make reality so wearily real, and fob those duties off onto other electronic devices. What with the merger of the PC and the cellphone, those little plastic cases with speakers and LCD windows in 'em are becoming practically indispensable.GPS? SPS! (Social Positioning System) ala Facebook, Twitter, Google, Youtube, what have you.I had a dream. In the not so distant future, very good looking people walk around carrying their brains in little plastic cases. These beautiful people all seem to be quite bright, and maybe just a little daft, as they spend a lot of time talking to themselves, and pointing at and manipulating things that are not there. And they all seem to possess somewhat smallish heads and jaws, at least to a beetle-browed, lantern-jawed, trog holdout like me, who can remember names and dates and do arithmetic in my head. But at least they still have opposable thumbs.Ah, but snatch those little plastic cases away from them, and watch the air go out of their tires. Why, they do only incrementally better navigating through the world than chimpanzees.This is not to say chimpanzees are dumb. They are not. But my evolutionary hypothesis is, in this case, \"Use it or lose it\".I guess we shall see. Maybe HG Wells had it right about human evolution. Maybe in the future, there will be the toy makers and the toy users. The producers and the consumers. The Morlocks and the Eloi.Anyone got a good recipe for Eloi?"},
{"title": "The Singularity Will Not Be Televised", "date": "Wednesday, November 25, 2009", "text": "I googled \"Singularity\", and received 1,180,000 results in .11 seconds. The first result entry was from wikipedia. The second result was from Ray Kurzweil's site. Actually, I should google \"technological singularity\" to weed out the off-topic subjects, which I do now...Ah, that's better. I received 106,000 results in .34 seconds. Again, wikipedia is number one. The second site is a philosophical treatment on how to survive a Vingean singularity... by Vernor Vinge. The third result is a google books sample of Ray Kurzweil's \"The Singularity is Near\". Actually, there is something futuristically ironic about what I just done did, as more than likely, Google will be the superhuman intelligence that ushers in the Singularity. (I very much doubt that wikipedia will be the instrument of change - not with the near reactionary fervor of its editors). Okay, just what the heck is the Singularity? Well, science fiction authors have given it treatment in one form or another long before it was ever called the Singularity. Usually, the narrative goes something like: group of scientists cobble together very large computer brain, and turn it onsaid computer brain becomes self-aware, or behaves as if it is (see Turing test)a) computer brain is many times smarter than the smartest human alive, or b) figures out a physical architecture and software package that is many times smarter than the smartest human alive, and implements itthrough the magic of storytelling, the computer brain can make changes to the world through a material instrumentality, because a) by just being so goddamn smart, it attains godlike, or Godlike powers, or b) the group of scientists was dumb enough to connect it to nuclear arsenals or automated facilities, or just does its bidding, or c) the brain figures out how to secretly mail order all the parts it needs to make a giant robot, or some type of gadget that allows it to attain godlike, or Godlike powers, or some such plot driver, and thenthe computer brain determines that: a) humanity is a threat to it, or a threat to the planet, or b) humanity is just too damn stupid to be in charge of things, or c) humanity is just too damn stupid, period and therefore:moving from worst- to best-case scenario... a) humanity is wiped out, or b) computer brain heads out for Parts Unknown, humanity gets left behind literally and figuratively, or c) big brain alters humanity to be less stupid, or at least, much, much nicer.In short, it is almost a theological scenario where, positing that a superintelligence (God) exists, then It is either malevolent, or indifferent, or beneficent.   \"Yeah, okay. Well, so what?\" you say \"Isn't this all just some geek adolescent fantasy?\"Well, Ray  Kurzweill doesn't think so. People called transhumanists don't. Many philosophers like Nick Bostrom don't. You repeat \"Like I said, isn't this all just some geek adolescent fantasy?\" Well,... yeah, probably.But if it isn't, then all bets are off. At least that is what Vernor Vinge says. Vinge is a science fiction author who coined the term \"Singularity\", or at least made it popular among geeks. Vinge's conundrum is a story-telling one. How can you write about an era of super technology and super intelligence, when things have advanced so far and fast that many things will be beyond human imagination? Isn't that like expecting gerbils to write about nuclear fission? Well, yes, but then it becomes a challenge to writers, and many have accepted it.Me? I think you can write about the Singularity, simply because we've seen it all before in the history of life on earth. It's all Biology. Want to write about nanotech? Nanotech's been done to death, baby. It is a four billion year old (at least) technology, which occurs every damn day using cellular machinery. Want to know post-Singularity strategies of life and living? Look at all the creepy things bacteria and viruses do. Look at the consortia and cooperatives that unicellular life engages in - not to mention multicellular life.Is there a place for humans in a post-Singularity world? Is there room for story-telling? I think so. Again look to a history of Life on Earth. There are plenty of creatures that manage to get along without wiping each other out. This particular malevolent fantasy we engage may make for good drama, but it is not very realistic. I don't think the future is going to be the immortal heaven that Kurzweil hopes for. In fact, I think that fantasy rather infantile. But I do think there is room for us in it. Certainly room enough for lots of good storytelling."},

Reason being I've procrastinated on writing a new, shortened artist statement for the RAM (Rockford Art Museum) Midwestern Biennial, and now its due. So, finally, after putzing around all day and avoiding this task, and getting more and more irritable, I finally hunkered down in my office and wrote it. After about four drafts, I'm in a much better mood. A lot calmer, and the blood pressure is down. Here goes, for whomever it is besides Ellen that reads my shit:\"If I wrote a manifesto, it would be one sentence. The sentence would be “CONCEPT IS NOT ENOUGH”. My primary intent, my ambition, is for you to feel something when you look at my work.

Ideas alone, without a shared connection, are barren and empty things, a mere transfer of information. I feel emotion is underrated in our society, and in contemporary art. When someone asks me what a work of mine means, my response is what does a melody mean?I primarily make figurative work, because this is an obvious and effective means of conveying emotions – through gesture, posture, body language.

{"title": "It's got a beat, and you can dance to it.", "date": "Monday, November 23, 2009", "text": "I was originally going to write about one hypothesis of mine, but, as usual, I got sidetracked in my research and will now write two thoughts, and plug a few books.First, (but actually last), I just sent an email off to Professor Bernd Heinrich. (Professor Heinrich is at the University of Vermont, and wrote a book called \"Mind of the Raven\", which I enjoyed very much). Here's the text:\"Dear Professor Heinrich,I read your fascinating book \"Mind of the Raven\", and noted that you expressed puzzlement as to how ravens identified each other as individuals when you could discern no visual, auditory, or olfactory clues through human senses. I read that birds have four and sometimes five types of cone cells and can see in the ultraviolet as well. I'm wondering if anyone has developed a camera that can see as birds do, and if so, have they looked at ravens to see if their feathers have a unique or distinctive plumage in these wavelengths (or combination of wavelengths) we cannot see?Just a thought.Take care,John Kurman\"Well, that is the second hypothesis I had which I had no intention of writing about today: that birds, or corvids at least, can distinguish each other as individuals by distinctive colorations of their feathers in wavelengths that humans cannot see. This hypothesis is easily disproved by looking at birds in those wavelengths. So, I figured I'd write to Professor Hienrich in case no one had thought of this (though it seems simpleminded enough that someone should have). My original intention was to plug a book called \"Born To Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen\" by Christopher McDougall. I read this book as soon as my local library purchased it, towards the middle of summer. Not being one to follow popular culture, I only recently became aware that it was a bestseller. I'm plugging the book anyway. So imagine my delight, when, in checking the spelling for McDougall's name on Amazon, I find that Amazon's search results included a book by Hienrich called \"Why We Run: A Natural History\". I haven't read this book. According to the reviews, this is his book \"Racing the Antelope\" retitled and repackaged. I haven't read this book either, but I think I will. I'm assuming Heinrich explores a theme which was examined in McDougall's book - that we as a species evolved to run long distances, perhaps for the purpose of endurance hunting. I, for one, think the evidence is good for this, therefore I'll buy into this hypothesis for now.But that's not what my hypothesis is about. Given (assume as true) that we are long-distance running apes, then I think I have a good explanation for our musical gifts and facility at rhythm. It involves the idea that our musical and rhythmic talents are a pre-adaptation. What's a pre-adaptation? It is when an animal possesses a structure or behavior that becomes exploited or useful in an entirely different manner at some later stage in evolutionary time. The classic example is feathers. We all know (or should) that birds are descendants of dinosaurs. And we all know (or should) that some dinosaurs, perhaps more than most, had feathers. (There are many fossil discoveries which show dinosaurs had  feathers. Don't take my word for it).  Feathers are very useful for flight in birds. But birds did not evolve feathers to fly. Feathers were there before birds, and the inherited property of having feathers from their dino-ancestors came in handy for flight. That's pre-adaptation.I think we got music from running. I think the ability to efficiently run in time, in step, as an individual or in a group, was a pre-adaptation for rhythm. From rhythm, you get a beat, and once you got a beat, you are more than halfway there to jammin'. That's my idea."},

Do we really need another voice added to this raucous chorus? Well, I guess so, otherwise I wouldn't be doing this. Admittedly, there is a conceit that people would like to read this shit.But one thing I've noticed, ever since this blogging stuff started, was that pretty much every blog I read was boring. I mean really bland and boring. And it wasn't just the blogs. It seems that on almost every bulletin board and message board site I've visited and contributed to, I noticed I was more entertained by reading my own contributions than those of most others. This is not to say I'm particularly entertaining or amusing. It's just that you, you boring motherfucker, are not.So there you go. And since I'm already offending, I might as well get my politics out of the way. I would like to avoid discussion of politics. When it comes to politics, there are tons of bloggers who are much more informed, involved, and amusing than I am. Here's a site I found that pretty much reflects my views and is much, much funnier shit to read than what I can crank out: http://www.ginandtacos.comBut if you really must know, according to the magazine poll tests, I am in the company with the likes of Nelson Mandela, Gandhi, and the Dalai Lama, which makes me, in the eyes of many, a Socialist bastard and completely-fucked-in-the-brain goo-goo-eyed sappy wobblehead. I, in turn, consider politically (read socially) conservative types as obstructionist assholes who would rather we all go back to the \"good old days\" of living in caves and wallowing in our own waste products, rather than move forward into a potentially more promising - and scarier - future.So, I'm a progressive. I'd rather look to the future with clear eyes, than be blindsided by a dishonest and demented vision of the past, which I consider the socially restricted types to have a major problem with. I mean, if you are going to be a traditionalist, at least be honest about your own history, warts and all! And how completely fucked up are you conservative types, if you can't retain power in a country like the US of A that is, with a history of relatively stable and limited government, traditionally conservative? What a crop of fuckups!Anyway...I would rather talk about science, since, category-wise, politics and economics are a subset of biology, which in turn is a subset of chemistry, and thus physics, and so on. I would very much like to blame everything fucked up politically on the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and perhaps one day shall do so."},
{"title": "Thinkism and Doism", "date": "Thursday, November 19, 2009", "text": "I can't take credit for the terms - but I like them. I came across the terms on a website devoted to the Singularity (which I suppose I'll have to talk about sometime). A more common and possibly better phrase of the two methods would be Theory and Practice.  Now, the reason I bring this up is my last post kind of covered this. Imagining how something would be as opposed to actually doing it. And it is interesting how theoretical speculation - no matter how well informed - seems to fall far short of the mark as opposed to practice. Experience really does make all the difference. The unknown becomes known.Take glassblowing in space. It presupposes that people already actually know how to live in space. The experience of actually living in space turned out to be completely the opposite of what people expected. Take, for example, human health. It was assumed by doctors and biologists that life in orbit would be quite beneficial. Without the stresses and strains afflicted by living in gravity, they supposed that the human body would have an easy time of it. That life out there might actually be life prolonging. Well, it turned out not to be the case. Without gravity, bones and muscles deteriorated at an alarming rate. So much so that even just a few days in orbit turned people into old men and women. Weakened hearts, arteries, bones, were what occurred, contrary to theory.Or take another example. Futurism. As in the study and projection of conjectures into the future. Generally, futurists will use current situations, technology, knowledge and push those into the future, commonly called trendism. It is almost invariably wrong. No one expects the unexpected. Or as my brother put it once, \"Not a single Futurist ever predicted a blue pill that would give you a stiffy\".The way I look at it, philosophy is Thinkism. Science is Doism. Or, within the realm of physics, theoreticians are Thinkists, experimentalists are Doists. I suppose Thinkists have their place in the world, limited though it may be. But I guess I am firmly in the camp of the Doists.Although it is fun to speculate. And informed speculation even funner."},
{"title": "Glassbowing.. IN SPACE!", "date": "Sunday, August 16, 2009", "text": "Years ago, I posted on a bulletin board system hosted by Intelligent Child. It was, for a brief while, a wonderful place. A sun-dappled green glen on the www. And there, among other things, we had a few discussions about blowing glass in space. And the idea, of course, is that every glassblower thinks he can do really amazing things in zero gravity. Like making impossible shapes that defy gravity. Well, they seem to do that here on Earth.The problem, as we all agreed - there in that cool, clear gathering - was that gravity was a glassblower's bestest buddy. So we would have to reinvent gravity for some parts of what a glassblower does.But what does he or she do? Well, on Earth, they take a hollow pipe, stick it in a mass of molten glass in the furnace, twirl it like a pool cue, and gather up a gob on the end of their pipe, which is called a gather. Then they can trap air in the pipe and make a bubble. (They hardly ever actually blow). Then they sit at a bench, and manipulate the glass with tools of metal and wood, or roll it on a thick sheet of stainless, called a marver. And when the glass gob gets cold, they stick it in the gloryhole for a reheat.I can't let that term go by. Gloryhole. Not a good term, especially for something - to a metals  guy like me - that is so cool. A gloryhole, in this context, is a horizontal furnace, open at one end, with a gas jet heating the interior from a burner cut in the side. Usually found as 55 gallon drum with ceramic fiber lined interior.And then, if they let the bubble cool, they can get another gather out of the furnace. Or a third, fourth, etc. They can spin the pipe, like a flag girl, and lengthen the soft bubble out. They do all sorts of kooky things, but then finally, they have to crack it off. Or jack it off, since they use a tool called a jack.So just now, I've told you there are two parts that make zero gravity advantageous. The first is the gather. On Earth, if you want to make something big, you have to gather more and more glass. And, if you are a glassblower, and like your back, you hire a Mongo to gather for you. I'm guessing the world record is ten or twelve gathers. The second part is the crack off. If you have a Humunguloidal Awkward on your hands, it's easier to manhandle that beast into an annealing kiln in zero-g.There is a third part not mentioned. A duty attached to sitting at the bench, with the soft molten bubble on the pipe, is that you have to constantly rotate it, or it will droop and go out of kilter. Some would think this a superb advantage in space. But actually, I suspect it would take far more effort to keep a soft bubble in kilter, in zero-g, as opposed to what our human reactions to falling things can do in our one-g world.The next subject was what would it take to put a fully stocked and equipped studio up in orbit? What was needed? A furnace, obviously. Gloryholes. Two of them. All electric of course. You'd have a devil of a time with the studio air enough, without gas. You have to have air flow, to keep from killing everyone in suffocating heat - because, in space, heat does not rise, it moves outward. So, basically, you need this billion dollar satellite to make thousand dollar items. Okay, assume that's okay.Fine. It's an HVAC nightmare. \"How about we suit the glassblowers and assistants up, and let them work in raw vacuum?\" \"What about the blowing part of blowing glass?\" \"Duh! There's this thing called pressurized air?\" \"So, how about the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle? Perfect! That's a lot cheaper!\"Actually, no. You need a contained room. You need an atmosphere. You need these things, because the vacuum of space will chill the glass too quickly. You need air, because colors in the glass will dull, due to being in a reducing atmosphere (without oxygen). You need an HVAC nightmare.Oh, there were more technical details to figure out, which were, but you get the point. Imagination can only take you so far. The point is freedom. And degrees of freedom. People have a funny way of adapting to new environments. They never adapt the way you expect them to. And that, of course, is because you cant' really imagine what the new situation is like. It's the difference between Thinkism and Doism. If you haven't experienced it, you don't really know it, can't imagine it. But I could see some real beauties would have come out of Vetreria Orbita.I'm thinking about Neanderthals. Those big guys that lived on the ice. Frost Giants. Titans. All those old Norse myths may be about our (Homo Sapiens) dealings with Neanderthals. What's the deal? From what the evidence tells us, they were bigger, stronger...smarter. They had bigger brains than we do. And aren't we, in comparson, the Little People to them? So did we use magical deliciousness against them? Why are they gone if they so smart?Was it because they were slow? And we were quick? Or did we just eat the ground out from under them, once all the big game was gone? Did we have arrows? I don't think so. So we were evenly matched tool-wise, from what I recall. But the Neanderthals are gone. Or are they? Do we carry Neanderthal genes? Some say yes, then others say maybe, and now I don't know. Third Base!I think Neaderthal genes are with us. I see a lot of people that look like them. But then, I'm mean. But I do. I think we owe some of our big brains to them. Now all we have to do is use them on a regular basis."}
