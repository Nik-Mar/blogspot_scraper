I started the new year with a hike which makes me happy.So here's to 2024!"},

{"title": "Stressfull last month and a half", "date": "Saturday, April 9, 2022", "text": "So, my husband suffers from chronic back pain.  Had surgery in 2009 and it helped for a while, then over time one who have had back surgery, including any type of fusion of the vertibrae, the movement can translater more to the level above and below.  Along with normal age related degeneration that is unavoidable...one has more problems and pain.  This and the fact that my husband is not terribly health conscious and does not stretch or walk - he is aging poorly.Well, we had a family member who had a morphine pump installed and it did wonders for his pain, my husband went through all the pain protocol and tried everything and finally decided he wanted that also.  He had the pain pump installed under his skin in Nov.  He has lots of problems just with that procedure, then it took several weeks to heal and get the medication level right.  Then about 6 weeks ago, after I got home from Texas...he was walking to the bathroom early in the morning and fell and had a huge gooseegg on his left upper forehead.  I ran into help him and saw that his head was bleeding and huge bump...I helped him off the floor back onto the bed.  He was crying out in pain.  I took him to the hospital...I was concerned about his head injury, but not only did he hurt his low back, now he had shoulder and neck pain.  They did films of all...come to find out - he had 2 neck fractures!  So crazy.  So, they put him in a very stiff neck brace and released him to follow up with a neurosurgeon.  Cut to 5 weeks after that, they have done more films, recommend MRI (did this past week - still waiting on results).  And has to wear the brace 2 more months!  And it gives him severe anxiety and depression.  And now we wait to see if he has to have surgery.Just wanted to check in and jot down some thoughts.  Has been very difficult, the depression and anxiety is the worst, i know he will eventually heal his neck and stablize his back (please Jesus).  But I just feel so helpless.  Meanwhile, I am working the same crazy 60 hours and now it is mowing season.  We have a large yard...1 acre we mow.  I did the entire yard last weekend by myself and it was not too bad...so I feel that is doable.  I am not going to have a garden or flowers in pots this year to also take care of.  I am trying to streamline things around the house and minimize, get rid of even more clutter/unnec stuff and just put one foot in front of the other.  The prospect of caring from this house, 4 dogs, the yard, my job...it gets overwhelming at times, but i just take a deep breath and know I can do it and remember how grateful I am for a warm home, a loving partner and dogs i enjoy, good friends and extended family.Well, I will try to come back and write down more to help process everything.  I hope everyone out there is doing well and dealing with whatever things life is throwing at you with patience, love, and prayer...deep breath, some sort of inspiration and gratitude...and a little humor.Thanks for reading."},
{"title": "My 2nd Full Day at Big Bend National Park in Texas", "date": "Thursday, March 3, 2022", "text": "On the 2nd day we had to spend in the park, we knew we were going to hike a trail in the Chisos Mountains portion, the central portion of the park.  So, we tried to get a little earlier start to drive the hour+ drive from our hotel so that we could find a trail we wanted to hike that had parking.  Some of the trails have very limited parking.  We were planning to do the Window or the Lost Mines Trail.  The Lost Mines Trail was pretty busy, so we drove on to the central Ranger Park area by the lodge and hooked up with a place to park so we could access the Windows Trail.  In the parking lot we saw a very tame, but partially lame roadrunner up close.This in the distance is essentially the V-shaped canyon we were walking toward, called the \"windows\".It was gradual downhill for almost the entire 2+ miles...meaning the entire time I was thinking I have to eventually turn around and walk back up this incline.  It was pretty gradual though, except for the park right next to the parking lot, that is a .3 mile staircase made out of railroad ties and rocks and dirt - it was a real bummer coming back up!  Got my heart really pumping!You can tell in these photos, the trail is mostly in a dry creek bed/canyon where the water runs in the wet season.  It looked essentially like a desert canyon, but parts of it had really pretty trees, large trees.  My hiking friend said some of it looked like parts of northern California.  Others looked more like Arizona or Texas.This is me sitting in the last section of the Canyon before it goes through the \"window\".  This is looking back to where we came from and eventually had to walk back through.  Many rocks and trees.  As we walked back and felt like we still had enough energy, we took a side canyon trail that goes up the side of one of the canyon walls, so show a lookout up above the \"window\".  I think it was called Oak Canyon.  It was about 2 miles and then one can keep on going on beyond the window canyon and down into the lowlands and on out to an old ranch site off of the Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive.This was a shot of my lookout way up above the window, to the right, as I looked out at the valley.This was a shot of our hike back, about 4.4 miles total in and back.  In the distance, you can see Emory Peak, which is the highest peak in the Chisos Mountains.  About 7500+ feet high.  But being as this area is part of the high desert, we were already 1700+ feet up, so we were feeling the altitude a little this day, all the incline and up and over the rocks, etc.  After we got back to the car and drank more water and had a snack, we decided to ride down part of the Ross Maxwell Scenic drive again and see if we could find the turnoff for one of the ranch sites, where the Oak Canyon hike comes out.  I really wanted to see if we could see the \"window\" from the other side.  A sort of \"look where we were!\" - type of thing.  So, we parked and walked about a mile or so down this road to see the other side.  We met an older couple looking very cute and experienced in their hiking gear walking toward us.  They had done the entire hike one way - to the valley side.  The woman pointed out the trail and confirmed for us, which of the rock structures we were looking at.  The window we were just at, is the large \"v\" canyon in the middle.  It was cool to see it from this side.  After this, we said good bye to this beautiful park and made our way back to Alpine for dinner.  We ate at the historic Hammond, and shared a steak and a salad - it was very good.  I would definitely come to this area again.  I really want to go back and do the 11 mile hike up Emory Peak - after I condition myself to be able to carry 3 liters of water in my backpack!Have a great week!"},
{"title": "Back just in time looking at the weather!", "date": "Thursday, February 24, 2022", "text": "I have a friend who loves a road trip and a good hike - she drove the entire 12 hours to BBNP and back!  I was the navigation and co pilot.  We went on a few nice hikes!Here is the Wiki link:  Big Bend National Park - WikipediaWe stayed about 70 miles away (this area of Texas is spread out and pretty isolated and the places in closer Terlingua, TX were booked up!) in a cute little Western Texas town called Alpine - we did a walking tour when we got there Friday afternoon.  The next day we went to the park and the Ranger Station and got some maps and visited the Eastern most corner of the park, the Rio Grande Valley.  On the way there, we saw a fossil display area - really cool.  Describing how millions of years ago, this area that is now a desert was a shallow ocean.  The archeologist who discovered T Rex (unsure where) came here and found more T Rex and there was a dinosaur discovered here called Alamosaurus.  The display said (I think) in 1940 it took 6 men and a horse drawn wagon several days just to get the head removed and preserved!This picture shows an TRex head (replica) a Deinosaucous (I think closest head) and a flying dinosaur replica - I almost think that flying one would scare me the most!We drove past the Boquillas crossing (into Mexico) and saw the Rio Grande for the first time from the overlook near Boquillas, Mexico.  Then we hiked the Boquillas Canyon trail.  It was pretty!We spent the entire first day seeing the desert portion of the park.  We went to lunch area and had our car lunch on a picnic table under the large cottonwood trees.  Then we started the 3.5 mile (one way) hike along the southwest trail, which was already pretty warm.  We hiked all the way to the overlook about 1.5 miles and enjoyed that pretty view and walked back.  Then we drove to the shorter 1.4 hike near the hot springs.  The hot springs are a popular spot, we felt like we would rather sit in the 100 degree spring early in the morning or late in the day!I was lucky enough to spot a road runner on our way driving to the closer hike to the springs.  I did not catch him with a photo though.  On our way driving to the park we also saw coyote, a wild boar and antelope.  The next day we would see mule deer, javelina and couple more road runners.After the hot springs, we drove by the centrally located Chisos Mountains station to plan our 2nd and last day, on our way to catch the sunrise at Santa Elena Canyon, which is closer to the west side and also along the Rio Grande.This is a pretty popular spot to see pictures taken in this park.  The taller cliffs on the left are Mexico and the cliff on the right is USA.  There is a hike that runs along the canyon on the right with steps and railings for a pretty overlook hike, but it was getting late in the day and although we both had lights, i was not really up for trying to walk more in the dark!So we drove back along the very pretty scenic Ross Maxwell drive along the Nail and Wilson ranch sites, the Mule Ears mountain, the Tuff Canyon, etc to a really pretty vista called Sotol Vista Overlook where we finished up seeing the sunset and stayed until 9pm to see the dark sky light up with the stars, plants and part of the Milky Way Galaxy - next time I will take a good camera for that!The 2nd to the last photo in these 4, the split in the canyon in the middle level of the horizon showing the cliffs is where Santa Elena Canyon is.  Just amazing to see!  This park is a designated \"dark sky\" area, where this is almost zero light polution, allowing one to see the stars all around, almost like a snow globe effect!Hope you enjoy.  I will post more next week about our hike in the Chisos Mountains!"},

{"title": "More Winter", "date": "Tuesday, February 8, 2022", "text": "Well, we got about 6 inches of snow last week and it has stayed pretty chilly, but warming up slowly.  We still have some patches here and there, but the sun is making short work of it. I am trying to go strict on keto, want to lose a little weight in case I get to go on a little vacation with my cousin to Mexico.  This is Rocky Point Mexico, so she will be driving down from her home if Phoenix.  She has been many times over the years.  But my DH is a little nervous, what do you think.  It includes driving about 60 miles from the Mexican border down to the gulf.  It may not be an issue, because I have to send in my passport to be renewed, so I will pay for the expedited but it's anyone's guess whether it will come back in a timely manner...stay tuned.I have made some pretty decent keto recipes...one for a dessert called Sex in a Pan...you can find it on Pinterest.  I found the addition of a 1/2 cup of finely chopped almonds really helps the \"crust\".  I gave the recipe to my girlfriend in Florida and she and I both discussed it could be made easier with sugar free-instant pudding and cool whip.  But I am proud of myself for making homemade pudding and it was really good (rich).  I also made a good \"mock\" potato salad made with roasted cauliflower.  It was pretty good too.  And a decent bread, made with almond flour and baking soda.  I will definately make these again.The other day they were spreading chicken waste in a field and there were vultures, crows and eagles everywhere.  I took a photo of 3 eagles sitting in a tree...hope you enjoy."},
{"title": "Winter is Coming", "date": "Wednesday, February 2, 2022", "text": "Reminds me of the old Game of Thrones memes.  Did you watch Game of Thrones?  I watched very late, in 2019 after DH and I retired (I am now un-retired) and working a gazillion hours a week.  I asked off for this Saturday to go on another hike and still have not been told if I am going to get the day off.Today it is getting cold and windy and gray.  Supposed to be snowing this evening.  People i am friends with on Facebook are talking about the snow they are getting and how the stores are all busy and running out of milk and bread.  Isn't it strange that is what everyone buys when the weather turns bad.I got a wagon full of wood so we can have a fire in our woodstove tonight.  Supposed to be cold through Friday and fairly typical Saturday, so I am still going to go on that hike if I get the day off.  If not, I will take a long weekend the weekend of President's Day and go on a roadtrip to hike in TX with a hiking friend.  Go ahead employer...make my day.So, Sunday was a pretty sunny day and i enjoyed a 5.5 mile with with some hiker friends on a golf course in Bella Vista.  Was such a pretty course and pretty day.  I missed the first half of the Chiefs game, then hurried home with tacos.  Just in time to see the sad ending...booooooo.Oh well, guess I don't have to stay up late and watch the Super Bowl and be tired the next day.  Ha - gotta look at the positive.  I did get a chuckle out of this i saw on FB:"},
{"title": "Happy Hump Day Wednesday the Last Week of January", "date": "Wednesday, January 26, 2022", "text": "So, on my only day off I managed to get up at 5:30am and get my hiking clothes on and drive 30 min to meet my friend who rode with me the rest of the 2 hour drive to the hike Sunday.  At 5:30am it was 29 degrees...brrrrrrr!We stopped on our way to the mountain at this pretty lake and took a couple of photos, but did not stay long as we were eager to get to the visitor center and a bathroom!We had a nice turnout, about 17 gals and one gal hiked carrying her 4 year old son in a backpack set-up.  She is a rock star.  I spoke with her briefly during the hike and learned that she is a newly widowed single mother of one.  Her son turned 4 the very next day after the hike.  I did not ask her for details about her husband's passing, but my heart went out to her.  I told her I also was a widow - at age 26.  Anyway, I was very impressed that she was out and doing the hike and meeting people.  Go moms!I think I have posted about Mount Magazine before.  It is the highest mountain, not only in Arkansas, but between the Mississippi and the Rockies.  At least I think that is what the visitor center guy told us.  Anyway, feel free to google.The first part of the trail is just a nice walk in the woods, as my friend S described it.  Surprisingly, she has WAAAAAYYYYY more hiking experience than I, but she had not hiked Mt Magazine yet, and I had.  This was the first time with this group - it is a group I found on Facebook.  Toward the end of the hike (after we hiked to Signal Hill to see the sign at the \"top\" and the geological medallion) we started to see the beautiful vistas!  These are some of us gals taking it in.  After that, we all went to the lodge and had a nice lunch.  It was a great day.  Some of them stayed for the sunset, which I REALLY wanted to do, but I had 2.5 hours to drive home down the mountain and I had to work Monday early.  Also I knew S was getting up to drive 3 hours east to do some hikes in the Buffalo River Area (so jealous).  So I stole some of the girls sunset photos they posted.  Hope you enjoy the pictures!  Have a great rest of your week.  After work, we are having breakfast for dinner.  Always a treat."},
{"title": "We Had Freezing Rain Today", "date": "Wednesday, January 19, 2022", "text": "Yay, it was fun.  Well, at least since I work at home.  I was safe and warm inside my home.  The bug guy came to spray today, so that was chaos.  We have 4 dogs and 2 of them are chihuahua's so, they bark and bark and bark non stop.  We have to put them all outside while he sprays inside, then we put them inside while he sprays outside.  They were making some weird noises, it was cold out there!  So, it spurred me to say to the guy, \"well, we better get going - they are freezing out there\"!  He is a talker!We did mention to him since he is from this area and knows a lot more people than we do...we would love to find our big baby girl a home - it is just too much having 4 dogs and DH health is not great, so I think we have a lot on our plate right now.  We just took them all 4 to the vet and bought their heart worm and flea/tick meds...over $600 for all!  The vet should be ok for rest of the year, but the meds are just 12 weeks for the heart worm prevention and 6 months for the flea/tick.  Well, not totally true - we need to set another appointment for the male chihuahua as he needs his teeth cleaned, that will be another $200-$300.  I was let off work early friday as our system was giving us issues, so they let us leave 2 hours early.  I was due to drive up to the lake to see my cousins and spend a couple nights with my aunt - one of my cousins has cancer, so I try to be supportive to them.  They have a big family and a lot of support.  My aunt is special to me, she has been such an important person in my life, alway has!  Especially after my mom (her sister) died in 1991.  She means a lot to my sister and me. My sister could not go, she and her husband were recovering from covid - said it was very mild.  I was not sure if the weather was going to cooperate with me, was supposed to get bad late Fri night or Sat - so when I was let off work 2 hours early I checked the forecast and was likely to outrun the bad weather - so I did.  Thank goodness the bad weather came Saturday in Mid Missouri.  I worked from the lake that day and they let us log off a half day early - as our computer system was down still.  Yay.  My aunt spent time at the condo (more about this later!) while her sons were able to spend time at my cousin's house.  We gave them time together and she and I ate frozen pizza, granola bars and microwave popcorn (that's all we had in the condo!).  By Sunday it was at least sunny again (cold!) so we did not have any bad roads to deal with.  Sunday my cousin who is well came over and saw the condo and we went out for breakfast, then we went back over to see my cousin who is fighting cancer.  He went to bed really early Sat night and stayed in bed all day Sunday.  We were all really worried that he would not be able to take his chemo yesterday, but he did.  it was only his 4th dose and I think he has like 8 or 10 planned and he is already feeling so bad!  I HATE it for him.Anyway, just finishing up with dinner here and i go to bed early on work nights!  Wed night we listen to music and read.  Enjoy your week!"},

{"title": "Sunny Tuesday sometime in January", "date": "Tuesday, January 11, 2022", "text": "I had a post on FB by a friend that asked for you to post the last picture on your phone.  I posted a picture and then posted the post to my page.  It was fun seeing my FB friends posting their pictures.  My girlfriend I grew up with who is building a home in the small town where she and I grew up/went to school...she posted a pretty picture of a rock with their last name and a light on it.  She said she got it for her husband's Christmas gift.  I said, huh, great minds think alike...as I had just admired and posted a picture of my rocks framing our driveway.  These we made ourselves, using silicone adhesive to glue on the numbers/letter and solar spot lights.  These pictures right after we \"installed\" the rocks.  It was actually one big rock that broke in half - otherwise, DH and I would not have been able to get them into our truck!  You can see the small bushes that are next to each, they are growing nicely and we have since planted some decorative grass behind them as well.  This is them the other night.We think they turned out nice.  Enjoy making the yard look pretty.  What projects are you working on?  I need to clean all my blinds.  Maybe next month or so I will start doing a room at a time, lol.  I actually cleaned my windows last spring and noted that by mid summer they were already needing washed again!Speaking of quilt...I wish I could quilt...maybe I will learn that after I slow down hiking, lol.  But I do crochet.  I have 2 hand crocheted afgans on my Poshmark closet for sale...the green and burgundy one is 35 x 58 inches and the red, white and blue one is large...52 x 60.  This gal offered me $22 for them both, plus a blanket scarf I have listed!  I was like, not only no...but I immediately raised the price on both.  Geez.  Last fall I sold this sunflower one for $35.  That is more reasonable.  There are hours involved in making a nice afgan.  Come on, people!?Still slowly purging and selling, little by little.  Have several \"home goods\" things listed, but they are very slow to sell.  Still mostly selling clothes I don't wear anymore.  I.e. dressy work clothes.  I have spent a couple years hiking, deciding what gear I need.  I just bought my warm mid layer coat, a used Patagonia...set me back $140!  Used!  Bought a new with tags day pack on Poshmark, for $80, would have been $120+ at the store.  Love to hear stories of what you are saving up, planning for.  I was able to go on an impromptu \"hike\" with some of the women in the club Sunday.  It was in Bella Vista and was mostly on pavement, but I had not explored this area yet, and it was a pretty sunny (albeit windy) day, so I was grateful to get to go on a Sunday, since that is my only day off.We walked under the new by-pass that goes north on I-49 and connects Arkansas to Missouri, going around Bella Vista.  That was pretty wild.  I find the concept of through-trails fascinating, and perhaps this can be an area I explore more of as I retire, second time around - God willing.  God willing, that I am still healthy and able to do some through-trail walking.  I always toyed with the idea of backpacking, but I am afraid that ship has sailed.  You really need to be able to carry 30-35 pounds and do 10-15 miles a day.  We shall see, I guess.  Also, the problem of finding someone willing and able to go with me!My DH is not terribly well, health-wise.  Although, he did have a televisit with his nephrologist today, his kidneys/related lab counts are looking good.  2 years ago he was feared to be Stage 4 kidney disease (probably diabetes related), but that was later adjusted to Stage 3.  Stage 5 is dialysis.  DH diabetes is currently being treated and responding well to medication.  So nephrologist was very encouraged and happy today, so that makes us happy.  DH needs to be more active, but he gets angry if I push too much.  On the other hand, if he plans anything or finds someone to walk with, he forgets.  Our big concern right now, is his memory - he is forgetting everything and it is scaring us both.  More on that in the future...Eventually I want to walk the entire 30+ miles Razorback Greenway from Fayetteville to Bella Vista.  I will do section at a time!  Have a great evening!"},
{"title": "Puttering", "date": "Thursday, January 6, 2022", "text": "Yesterday my DH was out on the side of the house that I don't visit much in the winter (north side).  He says that green bushy plant thing has buds on it...I was like, what plant is he talking about...?  On my north side I have ferns, hydrangea and hostas up by my house.  Then I have a walkway in between that and my raised beds.  This house had 2 raised beds, approx 3 by 5 feet.  They were full of nothing buy wild onions, which thrive here.  I cleaned them up and had my DH build me one more.  They now have iris, daffodil, lillies, salvia, and hopefully my hardy hibiscus will come back.  In the fall, I just rake bunch of leaves on it all and sort of insulate everything.  Oh, and my lenten rose is on the side of the ferns and hostas. I went and checked it.  Sure enough, it is getting ready.  I always thought of the crocus or daffodils as the early bloomers, but maybe my lenten rose will be first.  Wikipedia said end of February.  I love decluttering and organizing this time of year.  Sort of making my space more comfortable and enjoyable since I am inside so much, I guess.  Makes sense.  I like making simple little changes all year, that I enjoy from one season to the next.  For example, we moved our big bird feeder into the small fenced part of our yard, so it is easier to get to and see the birds.  It used to be out on the right side of our maple in the center of the picture - on the other side of the fence.  Around the bottom of that tree, the roots were bunched up and weird, I finally (after 6 years) moved some extra concrete blocks around it and added in dirt to even the ground out and surround the visible roots.  As I was adding dirt, I put in some Alum bulbs round the center and then Crocus bulbs around the perimeter.  I can't wait to se what blooms this spring.  I may have waited too late.  I was not planning to finish it this fall/winter - as I am pretty much stuck inside working.  Well, on the 30th, we got off work early plus my friend had given me some bulbs packages she got on sale, so I had the not-self-impossed deadlines to prompt me to get it done!  I am glad I did it last thursday, because by Sat evening, it had dropped from the 60's down into the 20's!Here it is after I planted the bulbs, before it snowed.Around this time, I was also killing a little bit of time and finally got out the step ladder and trimmed/trained my wisterida.  I was inspired by my DH and my projects to move the bird feeder and our big wind chime.  They are both hanging pretty high up in our 2 backyard oak trees.  Now the windchime is over closer to our bedroom, which I like because I can hear it faintly at night and I love it.  Here is my wisteria.This side of my house looks so wintery and sleeping right now.  I love when it comes alive in the spring and look forward to posting lots of pictures.  Have a great evening!"},

{"title": "Last Trip for a While!", "date": "Friday, October 16, 2020", "text": "It is Friday!  I am back working and putting in 10 hours today.  Will only get 20 hours in this week, as we were off Monday and I took off Tues - Thurs for my hiking trip.  But I am glad I worked Sunday so i will at least get partial check!It was nice having Monday off, but I spent much of my afternoon making a couple of dishes to take to the hiking trip for our pot luck the first night.  I made a bean dip and nachos fixings and made a cinnamon roll/caramel apple \"lasagna\" bake dish that I found on Pinterest.  It was yummy.  I also put out a few fall decorations like some pretty leaf garlands and a couple of metal pumpkins I put out on my front porch and a couple of wreaths - and that is about the extent of my fall effort!  Felt weird, because it was still mid 80's earlier this week!Went to bed pretty early, so I could get early start to meet my friend to ride to the hiking trip.  I belong to a hiking club and they do overnight spring trip and a fall trip each year.  Last spring we did the spring trip to Hot Springs, Arkansas.  This was literally right before Covid shutdown.  The hiking club fall trip was to Eminence, Missouri.  If you read my blog before today, you will recall that I went here a month ago to kayak on 3 of the area rivers and LOVED it.  This is an area in Southern Missouri about 1.5 hours Southeast of Springfiend.  It is a beautiful area consisting of beautiful pristine forest protected in the Mark Twain National Forest and limestone and dolomite rock caves and springs resulting in rock formations, caves and spring fed rivers.  Very pretty area, sparsely populated, but popular for travelers wanting to hike and enjoy the rivers and look for the wild horses that live here.  I will probably write and post pictures in multiple different entries on my blog because I took so many pictures and enjoyed it so much, I want to capture a record of it for myself as much as for the blog!  It was a great trip and I am so lucky to have happened across this hiking group that I joined a year and a half ago and have met so many wonderful people and made friends that I enjoy and admire so much.  The officers of the club pick the hikes and scout the areas, researching and access maps and then doing the hikes before they invite the entire group.  We have suspended carpooling and mask up when we are doing our group photos to be respectful and careful due to the virus.  The officers work so hard to give us interesting and pretty hikes.  They even find lodging and reserve blocks of rooms for our overnight trips.  This trip to Eminence, we stayed at Echo Bluff State Park.  There is a lodge and cabins and RV camping.  It was very nice.  Beautiful setting and wonderful accomodations.I will post more about our hikes and what pretty things we saw here.  I am just about ready to go for a short walk around the neighborhood with my DH.  The weather is just gorgeous now that I am back home.  I got home last evening around 7 and since there was a frost advisory, we rushed around for an hour trying to fit all our plants back in the house and garage.  We did not get all my cactus from the front porch in yet, but they seem OK today.  So maybe it didn't get below 32 last night.My DH was glad to be home and I sure missed him too.  I told him how much I want my next trip there for him to be with me, we will just have to fork over some money for dog care, so we can have a little get-away together.  I sure was glad to be in my nice, new, comfy bed last night!  I was the last one in the cabin to pick my room (3 bedrooms) and I got the horrible mattress in the bunk bed room at Echo Bluff cabin.  The dogs sure were glad to see me too."},
{"title": "OK and TX trip", "date": "Tuesday, October 6, 2020", "text": "I had a whirlwind trip to see my cousin in Southern OK.  Left at 3pm Friday and got there 7:30pm.  Just starting to get dark and a little cool.  I drove our convertible and had such a nice drive to and from.  Cousin and her husband have been very careful getting out too much and being in crowds since the Covid 19 virus, as have DH and myself.  But we decided to go ahead with this little visit, because she and I both needed it.  This time of year she usually comes to NW Arkansas and my aunts come south and we all do the War Eagle craft fair.  This is the first year we have missed this women's weekend since 1995 when we started.  So, cousin and I decided just she and I would visit...I just saw one aunt last weekend and saw my sister when we moved my Granny.Friday night we caught up and had wonderful late salad meal and went to bed pretty early after I got the tour of her home she shares with her delightful husband B.  They have a view of the south over the Red River, into North Texas that is about 15 miles.  I should have photographed it.  They also have 3 barn kitties, a big dog a little dog and 10 new chickens and a rooster.  She and I both enjoy gardening and so i took her a kalanchoe and a mother of thousands plant (both succulents).  Earlier this summer I mailed her a banana plant start off my plant my friend from Florida mailed me last year.  In this year of Covid, i have mailed and received seeds/plants from a few friends - it makes me smile.  I have also mailed a few care packages and that makes me smile too.  Food, cards, candles, blankets, etc.Sat morning cousin and I got up and went to the Dallas Arboretum to see all the pretty fall pumpkins and gourds and we had such a nice time.  It was beautiful there! Sat evening we went to Sam Moon and Bucees, because...well it is Texas!  Sam Moon and Bucees were busy, but we felt comfortable wearing our masks like everyone else and keeping our distance.  We got to go food from the Cheesecake Factory in Lakeview (?) which was crowded!  That was the only time we sort of felt uncomfortable, but again, we just kept masks on and washed our hands frequently.  We ate in her car!Sunday morning we visited more (non stop gabbing for us, lol) and talked about books and podcasts we recommended to each other.  I recommended the Bible Recap podcast to her and told her i recently had listened to Sally Field, Demi Moore and Jessica Simpson memoirs and she told me some of her book picks, including this Crazy Sexy Diet book and I ordered it on the spot from Ebay, along with one of her favorite books, Steering by Starlight, by Martha Beck.  I was lucky to find these 2 books used for $3 and $4 dollars, buy 3 get shippin free on Ebay!  I also got a couple more of my husband's fave authors (Nelson DeMille and Harlen Coben).  I have many of our favorite authors in hardback displayed in our library/dining room and I have all the ones we have in a digital file so when i find used book deals shopping, i can look to see if we have the particular title.  I use Inkpad app and i can share my notes among diff formats (laptop, cell phone) and i can share the notes with DH if he does the grocery shopping.I am working this afternoon and enjoying my candle I got at Bucees.  We both smelled about 40 and decided this one was our favorite.  DH even likes it.Do you have a favorite candle that you enjoy?  This one smells sort of masculine, with hint of cinnamon maybe.  I also liked My Dear Watson from Scentsy, but i am not sure if they still make it.  I like this mug my cousin had, trying to stay positive in this uncertain time of Covid and leading into an election...yuck I don't like discord and confrontation.  I avoid political talk then feel guilty like i should get better at discussing and hearing diff views.  Uggggh.  Well, i did have a great discussion with cousin and her husband about politics, beliefs, even religion and spirituality.  We can all discuss with respect - that is what is missing from social media today - the respect.  Like the disrespect i felt from a former friend the last year and a half which made me ask for distance from her - she tells you her beliefs and how they differ from yours and makes you feel like you are wrong and i don't need it!  Plenty of people in my life who make me feel inspired and energized, not defective and broken!  Stay away from people like that!Well, back on the healthy eating bandwagon.  I splurged way too much the last 2 weeks, so i made some squash and zucchini soup and will have that tonight.  Had a nice salad today for lunch.  I walked yesterday (my zoom yoga cancelled yesterday, my yoga instructor is on a meditation training).  I will walk another 4 today and tomorrow going on a challenging hike -5 miles, so that will be good for me.  But, it is supposed to be 84 tomorrow!  Whew.What are you doing to enjoy the fall?  See you soon"},
{"title": "wooooo weeeee i am tired", "date": "Tuesday, September 29, 2020", "text": "So I worked my 40 hours early last week, so i could take off at noon and drive up to the city.  I met my work friend B, we had sushi at one of our favorite places, downtown.  It was delicious.  Especially since it has been 11 months since our last sushi!  We had sushi here at this same place Oct 2019 when I had finished my 6 months of work last year.  Then I spent the night at my Aunt's house and bright and early Friday I went to my dear grandmother's old independent living apartment to start moving her stuff to her new place.  She is moving from a facility to a traditional apartment, but she is right  next door to my aunt (her daughter).  I completely filled my large SUV 3 times and took to the new place where I had to open 2 fire doors each trip (one with a key) all by myself and go down one flight and up one flight at new place.  It is a nice place where she is going - i just worry it will be so much for my aunt to be her sole caretaker, meal prep, laundry, etc.  But since it is her mother, she did not want to move her to skilled nursing.  So, we bought a baby monitor, an automatic doorbell that rings and flashes a strobe light (my Granny is almost deaf and blind) and we bought a riser for her toilet and bunch of LED light bulbs and night lights.  I moved all her clothes, knick nacks and utility closet.  At 5:30 I drove back north to where i used to live and I got to see my good friend and went out to dinner with her and her daughter/daughter's family.  It was nice to see them.  They had steaks, even the kids - a 7 year old and a 11 year old - eating steaks.  It was something.  I had shrimp and a baked potato and took most of mine to my aunt.  Saturday there could only be 2 people at my grandmothers place + movers, so I went up to my friend's farm and picked apples.  2 cousins were there at new place to help organize.  The planning was that my sister and I would finish what the movers did not get on Sunday before i went home.These are the apples I picked Saturday.  I had a nice time catching up with my friend and his 4 dogs.  He has 200 acres and enjoyed the visit too.  He got us a pizza for lunch.  From Caseys - so good!Sunday, my sister met me at my Granny's old apartment and helped me with all the kitchen and bathroom stuff, all the pictures on the wall, the window sheers.  On, and her African violets.Then my cousin and I went and bought the toilet riser, door bell, baby monitor, lights, etc  And I bought her a huge about 3 foot tall clock that we hung right over her TV!  We did some organizing and unpacking and my aunt served her some yummy home made vegetable soup.  Then, i finally got on the road to go home about 5:00.  I got home about 8:30pm.  Man, did my bed feel good!Here is a picture of my new fountain, it is in the courtyard right outside of our living room/bedroom and it sounds nice.  It has turned pretty cool here.  I am just getting ready to go for a walk before i start processing (cut up and core) some of the pears and put them in the freezer.  To help my aunt I have informed the old apartment I am handling my grandmother's account, i wrote them an e/mail yesterday hoping they would waive the 60 days notice and not charge her a month's rent ($1900+) because my aunt did not have 60 days notice when she received word that they could move her mom in to the apartment next to her.  The office manager called me today to ask about the issues i eluded to.  My grandmother fell several times and they never informed us, my grandmother would tell her daughter.  The call button worked off and on and one time after she pressed the button for help, the woman came to assist, then said \"I will be right back\" and left, never to return!  There were at least 2 times my grandmother was not served any food while being quarantined in her room.  I realize these things happen, now it just depends on how they handle know that we have informed them.  I explained that my aunt called several times and was not getting call backs from people (so she said).  I am not sure how many times/how long she waited for calls back, but i know that does happen.  So, the woman I talked to said she would let us know.  I know much of this is due to covid (my grandmother declined markedly due to her state of mind not having visitors and having hard time feeding herself - all they were feeding were sandwiches, so she could not really open cans of soup or fix herself something if she wanted somethng else).  But, I just don't understand not letting my aunt know about the falls, the office manager said it is not the facility's job to notify family about falls (?).  But it IS their emergency button that each resident depends on (?)  It felt like she was being very defensive and I did not even get the their policy not to let family in to help residents, but they would let hired care people to get in.  When we hired an independant 3rd party in to stay with my grandmother, she FELL ASLEEP WHILE SITTING WITH MY GRANDMOTHER.  UGH, maybe it is just a lot of factors that all came together in a bad way, but i am praying that my grandmother does not have to pay another month ALONG with the cost of this latest move + the $2,500 \"community fee\" she had to pay to get into this place that she planned to stay longer than just one year.  Hope you all are well out there and not too isolated.  We are all going to have a long winter."},
{"title": "First Day of Fall", "date": "Tuesday, September 22, 2020", "text": "I had the most yummy salad today for lunch.  It was chopped lettuce and greens with an egg, cold salmon, cherry tomatoes and a sprinkle of edemame and toasted pumpkin seeds.  Plus I crushed up a handful of tortilla chips and a tiny sprinkle of crunchy jalepeno crisps.  Now I need a nap.We turned off our AC finally this week.  I have a new fountain (I will post pictures next week).  So, now we can enjoy the fountain sounds even from inside our house.  But I keep thinking that either it is raining or that I left some water running somewhere, LOL.  It is in the high 70's during the day, maybe just into the low 80's and in the 50's at night.  Nice weather!  I opened all the windows and ran around and cleaned all the window sills, they get so yucky.  Dirt and flies.  Ew, too much information.  Esp on the north side of the house, the moisture.  The north side of our house now looks really nice since I scrubbed off the mildew this summer.  We are also getting a nice steady rain today and the humidity is 93%.  I scrubbed the range hood really good this morning and worked up quite a good sweat.  Speaking of sweat, I sat in my office all afternoon yesterday and was comfortable without even opening a window, but when i did yoga last night in the sitting room and the door closed to keep out the dogs, I was really sweating and started shaking, thinking what is wrong with me - then i realized - we turned off the AC Sunday!I have been having so much trouble with my right knee!  Then I lowered my desk chair - it is already better.  It has been so bad for a couple of weeks i was thinking of making a doctor's appointment.  Now that I am working and back to sitting up to 8 - 10 hours a day, it really makes a huge difference!We finally got our new bed.  We are loving all the room we have now, going from queen to king.  It isn't as crowed as i had feared.  I really want to get rid of the side tables and attach lamps over the headboard on the wall, but DH thinks he needs his drawers for storage.  Maybe next spring i will work on convincing him.  For now, i am just enjoying having essentially my own bed - we went for the twin base, and we can move the head or the foot up.  I love watching tv in bed, so i LOVE our new bed.  I caught a cute picture of my 2 chi's sitting on my lap yesterday.  It is rare to catch them close to each other.  They like the 2 big dogs more than they like each other.  Chihuahuas are sort of temperamental...shoking huh?  I had to just look up how to spell temperamental, I had no idea the first A was in there!The other evening, we went for a ride in the convertible to enjoy the pretty weather.  We were a little late getting back, after dog feeding time.  DH says, well Penny (the big pup) will be chewing on something by now!  Sure enough, we get home and she got into my yard and there was a single strand of yard going from the living room, out the back doggie door, through the patio area, out the fence and strewn all around our back yard!Sure am loving this bit of rain.  Save me from watering this week before i have to drive up to the city.  I worked Sunday so that i could take off Friday to go up and help my aunt move my grandmother.  She is moving into an apartment right next door to my aunt, so my aunt can take care of her.  At 101 she still insists on living alone, so i hope this works out.  It will still be a lot on my aunt making sure her mother eats.  But, it is what they have decided and i am being supportive.  I am helping pack/move Friday, then picking apples at my former colleague's farm, then Sunday my sister will join us to help organize/unpack after.  The movers are moving big stuff Saturday - not much just a few chairs and bed/dressers.  I will be happy to get it over with - not nearly as happy at grandmother and aunt!This is a picture of our weeping blue atlas cedar that we planted where we took out the huge crepe myrtle.  beforeafterWell, enjoy your first day of Fall!  See you next week."},
{"title": "Another Before and After and My Weekend River Exploring", "date": "Tuesday, September 15, 2020", "text": "Well, I had a great weekend!  It was filled with rivers and exploring and meeting new people.  It was so fun.  I have met some really nice women (and a few men) in the hiking club I joined Jan of 2019.  I have been really blessed to find this group.  My DH likes to relax and stay home more than i do, and now that we have 4 dogs, one of us pretty much needs to stay home.  Now, I have told DH several times, if he makes some friends and wants to kayak or golf more, then I would be happy to stay home with the dogs too.  But so far, it is mostly me who explores and i am grateful.A few weeks ago, one of my hiking friends said she was going to Southern Missouri to kayak and wanted to know if I was interested.  Well, I decided I should go before it gets cold and enjoy some time on my kayak!  The Chief first game was Thursday night, and since I had to get up at 4am, I went to bed and did not get to watch the game.  This was taken as i was about halfway to my friend's house.  Since she does not have a truck, we took DH truck and she is on the way anyway.  About 45 min from me.  I got to her house about 5:15am and we loaded her kayak and were about 3 more hours away.  The rest of the group camped Thursday night and did one river Thursday, but we missed that river.  So, on Friday we met them at another river and we had about 9 kayaks and 1 canoe.This first river was plenty of flow, but had low spots that acted like rapids due to the rocks and logs being flowed over quickly.  There was enough water to float, but one did have to pick our route and be aware of all the submerged rocks.  The sound as the water rushes over obstacles is loud - it sounded much worse than it was.  There was one place on this river where we went down about 3 feet on a \"ledge\" water fall - I was lucky enough to be in the middle, so a few of the other paddlers pointed out the best route and I made it through just fine.  I was too excited to take a picture of that particular area though!  Oh, and I did get to see an otter exit the river and run across the gravel bar into the woods.  It was cool!Some of the group camped in tents and a couple had campers.  Few of us like my friend and I rented a cabin (a dry cabin), but at least it had AC!  It is still in the 80's during the day, but cools at night...yet this time of the year it is still pretty humid.  Even though it was 80's or so during the day, the water we were on was mostly spring fed - so the rivers were COLD!  I did not get in.  But i was in tank and shorts the entire time - we had mostly overcast skies, and just had a brief sprinkling one day, so we put our rain jackets on for about 20 min and then the sun came out for a little while.During one of my earlier kayak floats this summer, I saw a gal with a dry bag that had big handle, like a tote bag, so I looked for one on Amazon.  I ended up getting one like a backpack, so can put most of my gear in one bag and keep it all dry.  I also got a waist pack to put my phone and my money/keys in that will stay with me and won't get lost if i end up in the river.  I can keep a jacket and a long sleeved shirt in case I need more coverage or get chilly.\\After floating Friday, my friend and I were pretty tired since we were up so early, so we fixed a quick and easy meal in electric skillet, showered and went to bed.  Next morning, Sat, we did another river and it was a beautiful float.  It was mostly sunny on Saturday and this river had more water, again cold and spring fed - so we did not get in (on purpose).  Luckily, none of us were dumped either.  This river was a little more crowded, as it was bigger and it was Satuday.  But it was still a very nice float and I managed to stay in the middle of the group and have some peace and quiet to study the flora and fauna.  Saturday, we saw some birds, lots of butterflies.  We really enjoyed this cave.  We could get about 10 kayaks a time in the cave and paddle around in the dark - it was a little eery.Saturday evening, we put together all our food and had a smorgasboard.  It was nice.  I still went to bed pretty early, because Sunday we were up early to pack for immediate departure after a shorter trip.  Friday we floated slightly over 10 miles, Saturday 8 miles and Sunday we only did about 5.  Sunday we were ready to head home after our final river, at about noon.This last river, was the one that I found had more \"strainers\".  That is an area where the river either changes direction or has a feature that traps logs and roots to gather and then creates an obstacle for river navigation.  This particular strainer was a tree caught over on the left side and facing upstream with much of the main trunk/limbs still exposed, so when I about ran into it, the tree about took my head off!  After this, I asked one of the other paddlers with experience what did wrong and she said that i mostly did everything correct, sometimes, you just get caught up.  I probably should have paddled away sooner than trying to turn away at the last might (you want to keep your nose pointed downstream, so you don't get tipped over) and then when I hit the tree I pushed off (which is evidently wrong) but by trying to push away, I was at least properly leaning toward the object, instead of away.  When you lean away, your opening goes low and water gets in, flipping the boat.  I got away just breathing heavy, but breathing!  My strategy of following the experienced kayakers and going where they were going had served me pretty well, all weekend.  I think in the spring (sans pandemic) I will take a class for some formal instruction and learn some technique.Anyway, all in all, despite it being such a long trip and being up so early every day, I was so glad I went.  But, GLAD to get home to my DH, my dogs and my own bed.These last few photos are of my guest room make over.  I have 2 guest rooms, one we have set up like a sitting room, with a sleeper sofa and my office and in between the sofa and chair - I have room to do my yoga.  The larger one, we have a queen bed and couple of chests and a couple of new pieces of furniture from IKEA where we can now fit twice as many sweaters, sweatshirts, fleece and flannel and blankets/throws.  It is a little busy, but we need it to be roomy enough for guests but functional.This was the room as it was in the listing when we bought it.And now, it is a little more crowded, but our guests have a large queen and satellite TV!  And I can do my treadmill in there on really hot or cold/rainy days.  I love it.Our house is a mix of small and quaint and function.  I am still getting rid of stuff, replacing with stuff that suits our new life now and improving the look and function of our possessions.  I am OK with keeping stuff that we LOVE, has value or works for us in some way (function).  Anything not fitting these categories I am slowly getting rid of (selling or donating).  I have listed several more pieces of our motorcycle gear and another 2 coats we don't need anylonger, but haven't sold any clothes in quite a while.  Last picture is a mural on an old grain silo in a little southern Missouri town, called Monett.  It was pretty cool and it getting quite a bit of attention!  We waited behind a man from Nebraska to get photos and behind us were a daughter from Oklahoma and her folks from Texas.  Enjoy!"},
{"title": "It's September but Still Feels Like August", "date": "Monday, September 7, 2020", "text": "So, I am not sure exactly what i was so busy doing last week, but it did seem like i was busy everyday with more than just work...that last weekend after my last post my sister and i ran up to the city to see my Grandmother.  All we could do was sit outside and so we brought our own chairs and planned to just be able to visit with her 1 person at a time, but the woman working the front desk let my sister and i visit with her in the lobby and my aunt was there too.  My Grandmother is looking good, alert, but very thin.  My aunt said she was down to about 93 pounds.  She is very small anyway - like 4'11\".  But she was in pretty good spirits and enjoyed the visit.  It was awful not getting to hug her.  I took her choc chip cookies and tomatoes.Then we finally broke down last week and subscribed to Dish satellite TV.  I figured as long as I am working and with winter coming and continued numbers of Covid 19 increasing in my state, we will just pretty much plan on staying home and staying safe, so let's get something to watch on TV!  I do have a couple of driving roadtrips and a couple of long weekend kayaking/hiking trips with a small group, but DH will appreciate having something to watch.  We had that done Wednesday and the Dish customer service setting up the service and the technician who came out and did the wiring and setup was great.  So far, we are really enjoying it.Then, we got a wild hair and decided to get a king size bed and sell our Queen - so we did that last week.  We ordered our king - and decided while we were at it to get the adjustable kind - i LOVE watching tv and reading in bed.  So, we had some back and forth with the bed store saying the bed was on backorder, no it's coming tomorrow!  Etc.  So we sold our old bed quickly to get it out of the way and the couple paid for it last Thursday on Venmo and then came to pick it up on Sat.  We also sold our guest room mattress (used less than 20 times) and will move our old tempurpedic into our guest room.  I will show picture next week and include my guest room makeover!  We got my Ikea order Monday last week and put the furniture together and finished the guest room Wed.  It looks so nice and i can store twice as much clothes.The garden still producing tomatoes, i have made salsa and given several jars away.  I have had tacos, nachos and taco salad, made stewed tomatoes and put some in vegetable soup.  My peppers are still growing too, so i decided to dry some.  They were all green and now that they are drying, turning yellow and red.  Very pretty.My sister and i talked plants and gardening while we were driving, so i am putting together a succulent sampler plant for her from my little growing collection.My husband and i are both enjoying this cypress vine that is growing in the lava rocks behind my trash container, next to my ivy topiary.  It is also called Cardinal vine.  It is so fine and dainty, but it is anything but timid - once it grows, you will never get rid of it!  But it is pretty.I really am loving my ivy topiaries.  One on each side of our shop/covered car port.  It was so much metal and concrete, we knew we wanted plants on each side to break up all that metal and concrete, it faces west, so i wanted something drought tollerant - plus i can leave it out there all year and it winters fine.This is a picture of my sweet little girl chi, Chili.  She has such a cute face.  But she is not a friendly dog to strangers.  During the time the satelite installer and the people who bought the bed were here, we had to keep all the dogs outside and they were not crazy about that!  They are so spoiled!Right now for the next week until our new bed arrives, we are sleeping on our old mattress, on the floor in our master bedroom - good luck keeping all the dogs off the bed right now!  It is only about 15 inches off the floor!  Even the 2 chi's can get right on it now.Well, i guess i better get back to work.  No rest for me on this Labor Day, i am working so that i can take off this friday.  I am going kayaking with a couple of girlfriends about 4 hours away.  We are going Friday, Sat and a little float Sunday before we drive home.  It is going to be so fun!I hope you are having a great Labor Day, and staying safe.  Maybe having something good to eat, on the grill or not.  I know thought it is hot and i am ready for cooler weather, I am not altogether ready for summer to go either.  See you next time."},
{"title": "Hot and Dry Here!", "date": "Tuesday, August 25, 2020", "text": "My work computer system is down most of today, so i am taking a break to post this.  It is so hot and dry here, we are watering stuff about an hour or hour and a half a day just to keep our bushes, new plants and some young trees alive.  Was very dry June and July, had a couple good rains in early August and dry again.  My thoughts go out to all the people and animals affected by both the fires and the hurricanes.  What a disaster on each end o the spectrum!One of my success stories is this cool trellis of ivy we have grown for nearly 3 years.  We started it in the spring of 2018 before we moved to this retirement house full time.This past Friday we had a program for DH uncle who passed away early last week.  He had military funeral at the nearby national cemetary.  It was nice.  DH sister and his mom had been going through his house and papers and had moved some stuff to be salvaged out (dishes and a little furniture).  They saved the truly personal effects (keepsakes and pictures to be passed out when all the family was gathered.  After the service, we went to his house to finish this task.  His house was dark, dank and filthy.  Very sad.  Much of the trees and shrubs outside had become overgrown and an eyesore.  The cousins all split up the pictures and a couple of antiques.  He had 2 overgrown plants that i am going to take a cutting from and make a nice plant for his sister - DH mom.  SIL asked if i wanted the overgrown plants and i opted for cuttings instead.  This type of reminders make me 1)  sad because who is going to go through my stuff?  We don't have kids.  My sister?  My neice and nephew?  My SIL and her husband have no children either, she stated this weekend that she and her husband donating their estate to a charity.  Not a bad idea.  And make me feel 2)  more determined than ever to always be cleaning out and aware of my possessions.  While DH brother was in town for the service, we played golf on Saturday.  It was HOT!  And i got off to a slow start.  Feeling hot and not hitting well.  I played with my new driver for the first time and it took a few holes to get used to it.  Then, viola!  It was really great.  I hit a few really nice drives, over 130 feet and seemed to really see progress with this driver!  Yay.  This is a picture of the many creeks running through the golf course we usually go to.  I got a 48 on the back 9, my best score every!  So happy.We finished the show Merlin on Amazon Prime.  It was really fun and enjoyable.  We both got tired of some of the repeated plot lines and some of the gaps in reasoning some of the characters displayed, but we enjoyed the theme and the time period and characters immensely.  It is about young King Arthur of Camelot, his trusty sidekick Merlin and Gwenivere (sp?) and the Knights of the Roundtable.  I give it 7 out of 10 stars.  I just heard on the radio they are doing sometype of limited comeback show about West Wing (which is one of my very favorite shows ever) this fall re voting.  Will probably be too political for my taste, but we shall see.  We started Yellowstone last night and will enjoy catching up on that - the season 3 final episode aired this past Sunday.  It is a ranch family, father is screen legend Kevin Costner - and it started a little slow, but by 2nd episode I was hooked!  I told DH if we get to a point we cannot find something to watch this fall, we will have to designate a couple nights a week for just reading.  We have a huge collection of mystery and crime novels.  But i still seem to find several shows i want to watch, including Friday Night Lights this fall, and Homeland this winter.  I just got a couple bags of small tomatoes for our friend who grows about 50 plants, since my work system was down - i made a 2nd batch of salsa.  I am going to take a jar to my high school friend whose step dad came home on hospice this past weekend.  She texted me.  I have a loaf of zucchine bread for her mom.  She is the gal i have distanced myself from and frankly have found it quite a relief to NOT be in daily multiple text/couple group text situations with her any longer.  She referenced the space she was giving me as i asked for.  I wanted to respond back that i did not request space, i requested RESPECT.  Maybe subliminally she took my request for respect and turned it into space.  Oh well.  I have known her since 3rd grade and love her mom and step dad.  It is sad.My own dear grandmother is not doing great either.  She is slowing way down, unable to take care of herself daily and falling.  We have hired daily care for her and my aunt is arranging to have her moved into same building my aunt is, right next door.  Well, my IKEA furniture should be here Friday and hopefully i will have before and after photos soon!  I haven't sold much lately or cleaned anything out.  But i will have to gear up for some fall clear out!  Here is another before and after (sort of)...This cool round firepit area concrete was here before we moved in.  We usu store away the chairs when not in use to be able to mow around and move the water hose easily.  The firepit area had these 3 stacked concrete 'things' in a half circle around the far side of the concrete - i found them useless and inhibiting to movement.  We never sat on them.  DH didn't want me to get rid of them for some reason.  So we kept 2 of them for 6 years.  Recently i asked again if i could get rid of them and he said yes.  So a couple weeks ago i decided to surprise him while he was out of town.  Turns out i love using a sledg hammer.  I like the clean look MUCH better.  You can see all the temp fencing i have up right now trying to get some new grass to seed - its a mess.  And a lot of watering!"},
{"title": "More Summer Stuff and Some Sad News", "date": "Monday, August 17, 2020", "text": "We found out last week my DH uncle had passed away in his home alone and the town police force called to let DH mom know.  She and my sister in law went over and took care of his affairs and made his arrangements.  They are this Friday.  He was a veteran, so he will have military burial.  He was a very nice man, funny, enjoyed talking to him.  I am sorry he died alone.  I am even more sorry he was an active alcoholic and did not have a relationship with God.I also heard about a woman in my hiking group, losing her son suddenly to a heart attack.  He was only 50.  Then, my DH brother's wife lost her mom.  She had fought a long battle with Alzheimers.  Something else troubling me is how quickly my dear Granny is declining.  She continues to have falls and mentally is just not doing well after nearly 6 months of isolation.  DH and i boarded 2 dogs and took 2 dogs with us to see our friends at the lake.  My friend, J i have known since grade school.  He inhereted his mom's lake home couple years ago, even thought they still live full time in Florida.  The lake has become even more busy than ever due to the Covid 19.  We stayed just one night, had a nice visit. Swam Saturday and took a boat ride Sunday, then drove home.  We took this girl with us and she was a big hit.  She stayed right close to the house and everyone loved her.  She does not want to get in the water though.  I tried for 30 min and she was not having it!During our boat ride, we saw this huge flag and i thought it was really neat looking, so i took a photo.At our friend's lake house, we had the downstairs bedroom which looks directly out at the lake and when we woke up Sunday morning, it was really foggy on the water because it is cooling off in the evenings, but still pretty hot during the day.  This week was supposed to cool off, but is still pretty warm today.  I like the cooler evenings, but i am not ready for summer to end yet.DH and i have become curious about having a place at the lake, so we are exploring that.  We have pretty much accepted that I will have to be back to work indefinitely to wisely afford a 2nd place, so i have began exploring that too.  My current team leader has indicated we might have a few years on this project and she has told me about a full time position - that is more of a long shot, because i am sure there will be a LOT of competition for each position.  I have also reached out to my old boss in the city to see if i can now work for them again remote, since everyone currently is remote - he sounded positive about the possibility...so we shall see.Have not sold much, but i did finally sell a jean jacket of DH that he bought and decided was too short.  So that's good.  And we agreed we are going to possibly go camping next month, so we are going to go through our equipment and keep what we will use and well what we don't want.  So, that will be really the last area of our stuff that we haven't cleared out.  September as it cools down will be a good time to clear out and organize the shop (3rd garage).  What i have been doing...i made 3 desserts to take to the lake for our potluck - they were all a big hit.  Choc cake, lemon bars and home made apple pie.  Or course, i had to at least sample all 3, lol.  But i have been doing really well not eating sweets otherwise and have decided that intermittant fasting is something i want to try.  I am doing 6 - 7 hours of eating and fasting the rest of the 17 - 18 hours.  I will let you know how that goes for me.  I don't need breakfast, so i wait for late lunch 1.30 or 2 and that way i can still eat after yoga at 7.30 or 8.I have planted some grass in 3 areas of my yard - so that next spring the grass will be mature enough that i can weed and feed.  This area is going to be my fountain area, eventually.  Between all the pavers i am getting grass going, so i still just mow right over it, but it looks interesting and minimizes the difficulty i have getting a lush grass area because of the traffic and because of the lack of sun all day there.  Plus, i can put a fountain in the center and minimize the trimming around the bottom.  More on that soon!I have also transplanted a few cactus and succulents to simplify my pots outside and have planted some things in my raised beds sort of late in the season, but so that i can simplify how much i will have to bring in for the winter in pots.  My west wide of my house is the front, but i am going to get it as low maintenance as possible, focusing on cactus and drought tolerant plants, since they get so much sun.  Here is my Florida cactus i potted in a bigger pot.When we got home from the lake yesterday, i took a nice leisurely walk while it was barely still light outside and when i got home DH was in the process of watering a bunch of my plants and it made me so happy because he is starting to enjoy the plants also and i did not even ask him for help.  So, maybe he will get hooked like me!Hope you are enjoying these last weeks of summer and taking time to make your daily lives better.  Bye for now."},
{"title": "Summer Stuff", "date": "Monday, August 10, 2020", "text": "So, here is a picture of my new planter(s) that I mentioned last post.  In the background, you can see the 2nd one, just like it.  I like them because they hold the pot up so that the stuff that hangs over the side can cascade over the side really pretty.I haven't sold much of anything, except a pair of jeans and a cool black Harley Davidson sweater.  But just selling jeans and a sweater this time of the year is good!  I also took a trunk load to Goodwill.  In getting my guest room makeover done, i got rid of one bed headboard and moved another one into place that i had in the attic.  Gave away the one with a large chest and mirror to a young man, a friend's son,  who is just getting his own place and got rid of something in my attic - win/win.  But, i had 3 large rubbermaid tubs under the bed storage boxes full of clothes and when I looked at it after being there for about 2 years I thought \"I don't need ANY of this\".  While, at the time I put it away, I was not ready to let go, evidently.  lol.  Basic clothes don't sell quickly or for hardly any money at all second-hand, so I mostly just give clothes away.  If you have a designer label or something really high quality (leather, jeans, coats, etc) I might try to sell, but just every day stuff (dresses, sweaters, etc) I mostly just donate most clothes instead of storing and messing with them.  But there is a time when I am ready to get rid of stuff, and when i am ready, i am ready, even a short time ago i might not be ready to get rid of.Our tomatoes are still doing well.  Getting lots.  I froze 4 quart bags last week.  This week I will give some to family and I think make tomato soup, even though it certainly isn't soup weather!  But a nice light tomato basil will taste nice.  My sister and I drove for the day Saturday to the lake to spend time with some family.  My cousins are twins and their birthday this week.  So I took them home made bread and tomatoes and we ended up eating some of the tomatoes and people were going nuts over the \"Arkansas tomatoes\"!  I took big and small red ones, yellow and pink.  One of my cousins was really liking the yellow.  My mother in law likes them best too, less acid.As for gardening, I have harvested some lettuce seed and will see if I can grow some more from seeds.  Pretty cool, huh?I was sharing gardening stories with my aunt and cousin and so i shared this one.  This house we bought in 2014 had a pretty pink crepe myrtle directly in front of the house.  As you can see, the plant there right near the front door, that's the crepe myrtle.  It is big, but not as big as it got before we just could'nt get around it.  Esp last summer, we had a really wet summer and it got so large that it blocked the sidewalk infront and was going up against the house, so we could not walk easily by on that side either.  So late last summer, we trimmed it way down and dug it up and moved it. Whew, it was a job!The pretty crepe myrtle is doing fine!  We are so happy.  We really had to hack away to get it out, so we were a little concerned.  If you look in the background of this picture, you can see where it used to be.  We planted a small weeping cedar tree that we are training to curve back and forth.  I will post more pictures of it next time.And finally, some cute dog photosHope you are staying cool and having a great August!  We are having a hot week, so i am just trying to enjoy summer while it lasts and not wanting to rush into fall!"},
{"title": "More Movement", "date": "Monday, August 3, 2020", "text": "So, i have been sort of watching my diet and cut out sugar and no wheat, except for a bad cheat day at Taco Bell and one piece of cake for our anniversary...I am sure my aches and pains are better.  I was trying to really use elimination diet to see if i could feel better, see if the soreness was related (I think it is) and get ready to go to the lake next weekend.  Sugar notoriously inflammatory. DH and i went across the countryside to get these cool iron planters stand thingy's (pictures next time) and got hungry and stopped at first thing open that wasn't crowded and it happened to be Taco Bell.  Oh well.  Otherwise eating good and enjoying the fresh tomatoes and salad lately!DH and i went to eat for our anniversary.  It was nice.  We took a pic in our convertable to remember this weird year.  I cannot deny that i did have a couple bites of this fabulous cake.  It was good, but mine is better.  Recipe next week, i think i am going to make it for DH to take to the city.  He is going up to play golf with his brother.I sold my Harley Davidson boots i posted picture of here last week.  $95!  I am currently in the process of gathering plans and materials to build a fountain.  This will go toward the pots i will buy.  Pictures soon!I also sold this gas firepit (we are getting a much smaller one) and gave away these tables...and a gas grill we don't use.  We are pretty fond of just a simple charcoal grill.  I am taking the day off tomorrow to kayak.  Hope you are enjoying August!  We have been blessed with some moderate much needed rain and cooler temps here.  Today mid 80's, about 10 degrees cooler than normal.  Love it!"},
{"title": "Movement Restricted Monday", "date": "Monday, July 27, 2020", "text": "So, I am a little troubled lately by the aches and pains that seem to be increasing in my life.  I am having a lot of pain in my back, knees and hips lately.  I do have an autoimmune condition that I have dealt with for many years, i am wondering if this is something related.  If so, perhaps my new-found commitment to cut out some sloppy eating will see results in my aches and pains.  I know before when i am in an autoimmune flare, i have a lot of general soreness and fatigue that is helped by multi facted approach (rest, meditation, movement, nutrition, supplements and yes, sometimes medicine).  I also know that since i am up about 15 pounds, that could be a big factor, so that might also benefit from my diet.  That being said, i am approaching mid 50's, so i am told - get used to it by several people!We are having some overcast skies and a little bit of relief in this hot weather.  We have chances for rain every day this week - we have our fingers crossed - so dry here!  Saturday we took 2 large chests from my guest room i am redoing - my neice decided she just couldn't find time/room to get the furniture, so we took it to my sister in law's consignment/2nd hand store.  I have also recently sold 3 golf clubs, a motorcycle seat back rest and some Harley Davidson luggage.  Here is a picture of the backpack i sold for $100!This back rest we sold for $175!  I ordered the 2 cubes from Ikea that will be replacing all the large, heavy and dark wood furniture that came out of the guest room.  Pictures to come - it will take a month to get the pieces delivered and another few days to put it all together!  LOLDH and my anniversary is tomorrow.  DH let's me buy whatever i want for the house.  One year we got a windchime.  One year a tree, etc.  This year i got 2 new crepe myrtles - the fragrant white Nachez crepe myrtle.  I planted them Saturday in the late afternoon heat and it was hot digging holes for them!  The ground is so dry and hard here, i was worried i would not be able to dig deep enough!This is what they will look like.I also took my potted geraniums and planted them out in my raised beds.  I got these geraniums from friend so i hate to lose them, but they are sort of boring little blooms and not a great pink, just a pastel - sort of boring.  I also moved some portulaca (i had to look up how to spell that!) that was growing in a pot.  I am trying to move as many of my perennials from pots to beds so i don't have to winter so many pots in the house this winter!  The advantage is, i had a lot of pretty greens that i wintered inside to provide color and interest in my deck pots and only bought a 6 pack of petunias and a 6 pack of impatiens to spread out with the greenery (vinca, asparagus fern, airplane plant, mother-of-millions and purple heart).  Next year i am going to do the same thing - focusing on these plants that do well and buy a few pretty flowers to add pretty color.  I am looking for a couple of the cool iron planters to add some height at the corners of my deck.  I saw some beautiful ones at the nursery Saturday but they were $100+ each!  I also planted a hyacinth vine that i started from a seed - it is already way bigger than 2 clematis i bought - but clematis are sort of slow to get started - and the hyacinth vine is an annual.  But they grow really fast - so i am going to try to plant several from seeds next year really early, like late winter.  I also see that some of my lettuce has gone to seed and i am going to see if i can get a little lettuce from seed next year.I am such a garden nerd, that i have big plans that inspire me that involve design and seeds.  LOL.  My DH thinks i am making the yard way more complicated, but i really do have a 2 year, 5 year and 10 year plan.  My plan is to get many areas of my garden/yard so that i can do as much or as little as i want from year to year (i.e. raised beds, bushes and mostly potted flowers).  But i really do enjoy creating it a lot.  I intend to get to a point where i am just maintaining...wonder if i am kidding myself?!  LOLI know much of my plans will be evolving and from trial basis - what i learn and adjust.  For example, in out front yard it is very sunny so i have English ivy (don't worry, it is contained to a small area) and cactus and i am increasing the cactus and succulents to reduce how much i have to water out front.  Right now we are watering even the bushes and shrubs, do to this dry summer we are having.  The important thing is 1)  i enjoy it and 2)  i hope it makes the house look nice and someday 3)  increase selling time/value.This little cactus my friends from Florida mailed me a piece and i am going to keep it going/repot it.What is your summer plans looking like where you are?"},
{"title": "Monday Mysteries", "date": "Monday, July 20, 2020", "text": "Couple of mysteries...First one.  I was excited that my banana tree my friend mailed me last year from Florida made it through the winter and was looking really nice (it does not get really tall like some i see around here).  But it was really full and lush looking.  Then we realized not only does it have a couple new plants coming off it...but 3!  So i offer to send one to my OK cousin whom i know loves growing things and a couple to my brother in law who loves growing things.  Well i sent my sister a picture of the plant and she says, i don't want anything to do with that weird scaly reptile looking thing! I looked at the picture again, and was like what is she talking about?  And then i realize it is my little barn i have underneath!  LOLMy cousin got her banana plant in the mail and was very excited!I got around to making my sister and myself a 'windchime' with my holey rocks!  I gave her hers this weekend.  We both agree they are cute, but need metal to hit the rocks to make more sound.  So we set out at couple places to find the perfect objects that were 1)  metal, 2)  would 'wear' well out in the elements and 3) were inexpensive.  We found these cute little crosses at Hobby Lobby and bought 3 each.  They will help the sound.I used fishing line and a piece of my Crepe Myrtle old wood.  Speaking of planting...i gave my Florida friend some seeds from my jasmine.  I can't wait to see how this stuff does down there.  We have to bring ours in the garage every winter.  We got the non hardy version and my husband refuses to let it die back.  It smells so good!OK for the other mystery...We had the handy man put a motion sensor light in the peak of our house to the north early June.  And we have another one in the back yard, which is fenced in.  Well, the back yard light never goes on unless it is us or the dogs that activate it.  But the north side we see on all hours of the night.  Last night it was on when i got up at 2am and i peered out the window and could see nothing!  Also, there have been 2 times something has pooped in my raised garden beds.  Weird.  DH thinks it is a stray cat or racoon.  I am now thinking i need a game camera on that side of the house!  It is interesting.  These are shots of that area during the day and at night.  The lights you see here are the solar spot lights i have trained on my arch i am growing wisteria on.  Last photos are my porch swingsAnd my dog Penny enjoying the window seat.  Have a great week!"},
{"title": "Typical Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday, July 14, 2020", "text": "Well here it is Tuesday.  I was so glad i was not going anywhere this last weekend after going to the lake 2 weekends in a row.  But i did get out on the river nearby and had a nice kayak float.  Went with a woman i know and one of her friends and a group out of Oklahoma we did not know.  Nice women and nice river.  However it did seem these Oklahoma women were in more of a hurry than us!  LOL.  We basically paddled the entire 10 miles!  But we did stop twice to visit and eat snacks/lunch.On the gravel bars i was told by 3 of them they look for heart shaped rocks.  I found one shaped like Oklahoma.  Then couple of them said they find lots of rocks with holes too.  I found a few.  Then my friend Lisa said they make cool wind-chimes so i found as many as i could.  I am going to make a wind chime for me and one for my sister.  Her birthday is tomorrow.  We are going to have lunch Saturday.Last week right after work i jumped in DH truck and ran and got a bed-full of mulch.  I put newspaper and cardboard down around all my hostas and then mulch.  They are said to do really well with rich organic matter based soil and the paper/cardboard breaks down while thwarting weeds...helps the plants stay watered in this dry hot summer weather.  It was a 2 day job.  I am SO glad it is finished.this was before much.And after!I hope you all are staying cool out there and staying healthy.  I have had a head cold for 8 days.  No fever.  I am doing ok, but yoga sure was difficult last night with my sinuses so clogged!  We have been blessed with some rain couple times in last week.  Makes it super humid, but stuff was really getting dry and brown!  I am worried about losing some of my new bushes and trees.  We are watching them close and watering them a lot.  The clouds have kept it from being too hot, was high 80's low 90's last few days but going to upper 90's rest of this week!  Good time to do my outside gardening and watering early in morning or late in evening...otherwise we are catching lots of movies on Netflix!  I am trying to convince myself that now is a good time to paint my master bath ceiling...we shall see.  It had an old leak that someone covered - badly.  Needs a dose of Kilz and a coat of paint and will be so nice and fresh.  To be continued...Signing off with my beautiful burgundy glad!  This is the first time i have grown gladiolas but i LOVE them."},
{"title": "Working Hard, Playing Hard", "date": "Tuesday, July 7, 2020", "text": "Well, i have been really working hard at my temp job.  We have been training and switching roles fairly regularly.  About the time i start to get comfortable with what i am supposed to understand and do...i get switched to another role.  It is a little stressful, but not nearly as stressful as this economy is to all the small business owners out there who i am trying to help.And speaking of which, I have not had one rude person.  Well, maybe a little bit rude, but not bad at all...especially considering my former life occupation when i was an insurance adjuster!  I feel for all these people trying to keep business going during such a weird time...and they mostly all have been very polite.  Inspiring to me.Well, having said that...about working hard, i did limit my hours the last 2 weeks to just 41 and took a part of the last 2 fridays to enjoy some time with family and friends.  Had a nice Forth.  Here are a couple of photos from the lake view.The first was a nice firework i tried to capture.  2nd photo is 3 of those lanterns that people light on fire and set afloat - how are these legal?!  But frankly, i thought the fireworks unable to compete with that fabulous moon!  Am I right?So, when i have not been working and running around i have been watering all my plants!  We are going on like 6 week drought here and i am trying not to lose some of my bushes, flowers and trees we have lovingly planted!  About 2 hours a day i am watering, weeking and picking veggies!Here are some of my produce photos.  My tomatoes are getting ready to just go nuts!  I cannot wait.  Hope you had a nice Fourth of July and are staying cool."},
{"title": "The Days are Moving So Fast!", "date": "Monday, June 22, 2020", "text": "Hope everyone out there had a nice Father's Day!My husband and I went on a short 3 hour kayak float on a nearby river.  It was only the 2nd time I have ever been in a kayak on a river.  Last Saturday I went with a group of about 20 on a larger river about 2 hours away.  It is a pretty well known river - The Buffalo River - in Arkansas.  It is actually the first National River designated in the US.  Here is the wiki link.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_National_River  It is a beautiful area. Some parts of this river are pretty dangerous due to the narrowing curves and the rocks.  Not so much the rapids, as such.  There are areas where the river descends enough so that is a big of a challenge too.  A year or two ago there is a large sinkhole where a man drowned.  He was pretty experienced kayaker from what I recall. I did an easy section last Saturday with some very experienced people.  We all are older and non drinkers/partiers.  I would not want to take a chance with people who were not experienced or who were drinking.  In 1995 when I was going to school in Arkansas, I did the challenging section...with an experienced outdoorsman, in a duel canoe.  We did flip over once, but were fine.  We were also in our 20's!My friend and I felt my DH would enjoy a shorter kayak and made plans to go Sunday with him.  I am so glad we did.  We enjoyed so much the pretty scenery and the animals we saw (birds, turtles, frogs, a snake, etc).  DH had a blast.  The river we did yesterday was getting low.  They say parts of the Buffalo (the lower) are getting low too.  We had a lot of rain in March - April but it has slowed considerably.  It usually does, but more towards late July.  This is a little early for our lawn to be turning brown.  We really don't have very good grass, so I am not going to worry much about it.  As I finish diff landscaping projects, I will worry about yard next.  I read that a good time to seed is around Labor Day.  It is good and warm, the dry hot weather may be easing by then...can plant seed and it will be mature enough for me to weed and feed next spring.  I am just going to work on very small portion of lawn in the backyard to perfect it before I expand to the front.I did have my bonfire Friday evening.  I scanned ALL my photos, scrapebooks, memorabilia, even yearbooks to my computer and burned all the originals, except what i am keeping for family (neice and nephews).  I love the feeling of getting rid of stuff so my house is not stuffed.  My in laws think i am crazy for getting rid of originals.  We had dinner with the in laws Saturday evening for Father's Day.  But my DH and his family are very much into antiques and keepsakes, just stuff.  Not me.  I used to be in my younger years, but the older i get the less around me I want to deal with.Now that I have been retired (semi retired) for close to 2 years, I know more about what stuff I will keep and use and what is just extra volume that I won't need (clothes, shoes, jewelry).  In a recent purge, I cleaned out a bunch of my costume jewelry and got rid of my large jewelry case.  At a local consignment store I found a small chest that fits under the counter in my bathroom where the vanity is. I love the smaller one.  It is in my bath now instead of my bedroom and the lighting is much better. Today it is pretty warm but this is late June.  I usu get up and work for an hour, then feed the dogs and when i let them out into the bigger yard, i water my vegetables.  My lettuce still going strong but growing to seed in next few weeks.  My spinach and kale is winding down.  My chard is about the same.  My tomatoes have tiny fruit and i am watching them close!Have a great Monday!"},
{"title": "hump day", "date": "Wednesday, June 17, 2020", "text": "Well I am really enjoying these longer days and warm evenings and so are my tomatoes! I just hope they actually produce some good tomatoes.  I learned the hard way last year not to get water on the leaves and burned up my tomatoes last summer.  We just got a few really puny ones.  But our cherry tomatoes have always produced by the bucket-full.  This year our cherry tomatoes (on our deck) aren't doing anything.  I would have figured it was the frost we got in late April, but we also bought some decorative grass from same store that is not doing anything either.Has been pretty hot and humid until late last week.  The heat and the work computer being down all last week promted me to find something inside to work on.  I have been wanting to streamline my home and reduce clutter (have been doing this for 10 years!).  I have a nice sized home, and love our high ceilings, but we still have to much stuff to comfortably store/access/clean around...so I have been doing another round of clearing stuff out. I work in a tiny office and am lucky to have high shelves, but wanted to put extra throw pillows way up high...so I had do something with the heavy boxes of pictures/letters/cards on the higher shelves.  Plus, I am liking my idea of storing light stuff up high.  So I decided to go through the boxes and scan the photos and keepsakes I want to retain electronically and other than a very few printed out photos, burn all the originals.  I know it would be impossible for some people to do this - burn a picture.  But DH and I have no children so pass this on to.  Most of it is just personal stuff for me.  But photos of relatives and my family I am passing on to my sister and my niece and nephew.  I even did my school year books, all 13.  I am only going to retain my senior scrap book and yearbook until my 40 high school reunion (God willing).  It has been a long job.  I just did a little everyday.  But I am going to have a cathartic burn pile when I am finished this week!This plus another crate I will burn in my fire pit Friday or Saturday.  This is all I have left to go, a small pile of photos/cards and 4 more year books.  I have gone from 4 of these big heavy boxes to 2.  One for me and one for DH.  His is FULL.I am taking another car load to my sister in laws store to sell.  The house is looking clearer and more streamlined, easier to clean around and all the rooms function in at least one way - some two.  For example in my sitting room I can do yoga, or crafts, or just sit and watch TV.  The closet in that room is my \"office\".  I took the door off and fashioned a \"desk\" out of the lowest shelf.  Above the shelf to save space a strung led string lights.  2 shelves above that are my office supplies and the unit hanging behind my paper/envelope holder.  I have a chalk/board/metal magnet holder and a cork board next to it.  I LOVE the coziness.  Anyway, I usually work in the breakfast nook in the mornings enjoying the east view and the yard/birds/watching my dogs play.  Then in the afternoon I move to my closet and can darken it and have the ceiling fan to help keep that room really cool.Hope you are staying cool and enjoying some fresh produce!  I cooked up a big bunch of rainbow chard last night.  Tonight we are having salad.  The lettuce is going crazy and will wind down in the next couple weeks."},

I feel sorry for old people locked away in their quarantines (like my dear granny).  I feel for all the animals being neglected...I am a real ray of sunshine but the important thing is...that DH and I had a talk about it and we both feel comfortable to support BLM and my DH is a former homicide detective.  So, enough about such weighty subjects!  I am just working and doing my yoga couple evenings a week and walking few times a week...I am enjoying my structure.Structure for me brings order and peace and quiets my mind.  As so does my devotional readings, meditation, exercise, music and mindless escapes like podcasts and Netflix!  And blogs!Here is a picture of my patio sitting area.  This makes me feel peaceful.  I hope you are finding your own oasis in the heat of this strange summer.  Peace!P.S.  My brother in law came down and got grand dad's homemade cabinet.  I got all of DH 45 years old huge wooden furniture moved out and I am waiting for a chance to run to closets IKEA for better/lighter/more efficient/brighter storage solutions for our sweaters and sweatshirts...and more importantly, my treadmill has been moved and I got my sitting room back.  I will be working (and yoga-ing) in here more, so I am happy for the space.  I truly loved this lovely one of a kind cabinet, but I just cannot afford the space.  It is going to the brother in the family who has kids.  They have some really cool WW2 artifacts to store in it.  Pictures on the room make over soon!Here is my cute sitting roomHere is the same small guest room before we bought the house.Before I go, just wanted to share a delicious thing I have been doing with fresh veggies, greens, frozen veggies - whatever you have!  I have learned that I prefer my arugula cooked.  So I cooked it in generous amount of butter.  Sauteed some slivered almonds and then I toss it with cooked pasta (I have used rice noodles for less gluten option) and I throw in some vegan faux cheese, and or feta cheese and or goat cheese and it is DELICIOUS.  My In laws loved it.  I have used fresh and frozen veggies (carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, zuchhini, etc) and greens - kale, spinach and/or arugula.  s"},

Job very stressful.  The gov agency is overwhelmed and lots of changes, new people.  Rules either haven't been made/tested out or no one knows what they are.  People who have experience are trying to teach 40 other people the job, etc.  Then I just about figure out the workload and I am already switched to another role with 3 week period of time.  Not to mention this stressful background/document signing process that took me over 2.5 hours one day to complete.  Asking for my parent's names/dob/place of birth...grandparents, in-laws, etc.  Crazy!But I am grateful for the income.  We finally sold DH main car (AFTER) he bought a truck (never too sick to shop for cars, ugggghhh).  To do so meant draining our savings and 2 weeks we had like $300 to our name.  I do NOT handle stuff like this.  I MUST have a rainy day fund.  Sure enough, truck already had engine light on, the contractor is able to start work on the holes in our siding (mostly north side - the hot humid weather here wreaks havoc on people's north sides - mold, decay, etc).  SoI tell contractor \"YES PLEASE\".  He is so busy, he might be working on other projects for months - so I nabbed him.  I will pay out of my retirement fund if I have to.  Point is, siding has holes in it and gutter got clogged so it backed up and rotted some of the fascia in the back, etc.  This stuff must be kept up with in my opinion or I go mad.Anyway.  Today and the rest of the week except Wed (I quickly mowed - won't let DH do mowing until doctor tells me it is ok).  And I am glad I got mowing done.  Next week more stuff business and stuff opening up around my state, but we are going to continue to play it very safe due to DH health, my inlaws and my elderly grandmother.Hope you are safe and you have roof over your head and food in your fridge.  See ya soon."},

Boss friend pointed out that VP worked and was too busy and was not good about following through.  Meanwhile I get new job - she was just asking me do this, do that, post this, share that, etc.  Enough!I feel like a weight lifted off me!As for the job with the government agency- well I did 2 days training and did at least get paid for that.  But I have done literally hours of emails and paperwork and get emails anywhere from 5:30am to 10pm and have yet to get paid for that!  I finally got my laptop computer UPS to me Wed and email 6am this morning saying we will have more training - next Tues.  Ugh.Here are some nice flowers to make me happy. I will just consider today and Monday 2 more days of freedom.  But honestly, I am in work mindset, ready to get into a schedule and make a little money.  I feel grateful very much because I really do worry about the country right now and think the rest of 2020 could be ugly.Be safe and find beauty where you can!"},
{"title": "Feel Like Posting Again", "date": "Monday, April 20, 2020", "text": "I don't really have anyone I can talk to about this.  So I will just form my thoughts into words and type them out and see if this helps.Last year was not a great year.  This year has turned out to be even worse - for so many people!  Timing-wise this really could not have happened at a better time for me - I retired (sort) of last fall, after a short return/weird commute weekly 4 hours away.  Really a big reason I went back to work last summer (2019) is because I was having some issues at home that I feared for my security and independence.  So I went back to work and it was good for things.  Gave DH and I some room for perspective.  I stopped the commute October 2019 and had a really nice fall and winter. Anyway, back to 2019.  My small hometown where I grew up - we have stayed close, some of us.  In late 2018 two of us diagnosed with stage 4 cancer - different kinds of cancer.  They eventually passed.  Well, while they were going through treatment, etc.  We all set up a group text.  It was really fun.  We did a lot of laughing, reminiscing and sharing inspiration. Which leads us to now...The widower of our good female friend, he asked last night to be removed from the group text.  This happened last year too, one of the friends dying - the male friend, he also asked to be removed.  I did not ask either one why.  But it has caused me to ponder - the psychology of group texts.  Obviously I am not a psychologist - LOL.  But I sure wish a psychologist would write on this subject. I will also add this - I too have wanted to be removed from this group text.  Why?  Well, it is sort of a weird awkward limbo - IF you don't have a purpose or if you have any type of conflict/discomfort with one of the participants.  And there is the obvious - how to you get out of it?  You can't without intentionally pointing it out. More on this later.  I will think about this all day.  Maybe I will come up with something good.  LOL.Speaking of limbo - I am in limbo.  Waiting for my government issued laptop.  Until then I am off the clock and guess I will do a short and sweet yoga and plan a nice walk for later.  Have a great Monday.  If you read this, thank you.  It helps just knowing you are out there."},

I did do a small hike outdoors with a few of the hiking group ladies.  Just 6 of us.  We do NOT carpool and mind social distancing very carefully/cover our face with masks if pref.  It was a beautiful day!  Lots of wild flowers.I have done a bit more work outside with my own flowers and hostas/veggies.  Has been very cold week.  3 nights we dipped below freezing so I was out running around covering things with tarps/sheets/towels.  Most of our stuff escaped unscathed.I am not complaining, my friends up north about 4 hours are having snow today.  Wed and Thurs were pretty, sunny and nice.  Today it is cool and gray.  I just lit a few lamps around the house and a candle for coziness.  I am stuck again day 2 here at computer for training.  It seems crazy introducing all these concepts to us with no written/electronically accessible material and no context of operating system we will be using - but they didn't ask me.  We get our dept issued laptops and cell phones next week.Well.  That's about all.  Oh, I did trade my little pick up for an SUV.  I really do prefer SUV's.  I just hope I don't miss the bed of my truck for hauling - maybe it will save me money in the yard!  I can't easily just go buy dirt/rocks/pavers, plants.  My DH is now going to sell his bike and get an older truck.I hope you all have a nice weekend!"},
{"title": "Friday Again, i am sensing a pattern here", "date": "Friday, April 10, 2020", "text": "So as of last Friday I mentioned I have a new job.  I started the onboarding process (electronic paperwork) Monday and did several documents Monday and a couple of missing/mistakes on Tuesday).  Then we got an email Tuesday evening like around 9:30pm, work Friday that all the people being hired still had onboarding documents, etc).  So I figure I have 2 more days off - more work in the yard - mowing, puttering around.  Planting a few more flowers, some more veggie seeds, etc.  Then we shopped for inlaws.  I helped with a couple more things with sister in law's yard, etc.I finished the border on my deck azalea area - the water rushes under my deck from neighborhood to our south and out the side where the azaleas are - that is why I spent the money and got rocks for this area - mulch would just be washed away.  Even the rocks washed over the flat brick pavers, so I got these longer thicker ones from my SIL and stood them vertical so I could fill in with more rocks and make it more substantial.  I love it.Oh, and she has a business where they sell vintage/used/flea market/antiques stuff, mostly furniture but also décor, seasonal, nick nacks, some glassware, etc.  She is know in the community and a woman downsizing sold bunch of furniture to SIL and SIL texted me that the lady was selling a treadmill.  So I bought it for $40!  I really don't have the room, but I just stuck it in the middle of my small guest room for the time being.  I will be glad I have in on really hot and really cold days.  Just don't like where it is at the time.I am eventually going to get rid of some bigger furniture, so my long term plan is to move to larger guest room.  I don't have company much, so I am not too worried about it being in either guest room.  But our furniture is big - was for bigger house and good functional well built furniture is hard to get rid of.  More on this later with photos!My DH is one of 3 boys and 1 sister.  Their grandfather made this beautiful walnut cabinet with glass out of a walnut tree he planted as a young man.  Then went off to war and came home and cut the tree down and made this.  I have my blankets in it that I crocheted.  I just gave one blanket away for a wedding present - the white and black houndstooth with red trim - see below.  Well, my brother in law has 2 sons so they are eventually going to come and take the cabinet so the boys will eventually get it. One son just got married - I gifted the blanket to them (and some cash!).  DH has agreed that I can then get rid of the huge bedroom set (he has owned since the 80's, and it is very nice, but so big and bulky/dark).  He is ok with the idea.  He is seeing as we get older we don't need so much stuff to take care off/move/clean around.I got an email this morning (after I went to bed early and got up early - preparing to work and GET PAID!).  No work yet this morning.  I sure hope the project otherwise goes smoothly - this is frustrating.  But since it is for an arm of the federal government - it moves like a glacier getting everyone on board.Oh well, guess we can finish working on our deck.  We painted our picnic (I always say pick-a-nick like the cartoon) in my head!  We painted it turquoise for fun pop.  The sellers of this house left it back there when they moved.  DH has replaced several of the boards, so it was diff colors of wood.  So we thought a bright paint job would be fun.It turned pretty cool this week Thurs after we had nearly 90 degrees Wed!  Weird.  I saw a post from a friend of mine that she was doing big Easter dinner and delivering to her loved ones, so I was inspired to do the same.  I am making baked ham, potato casserole, green beans, deviled eggs and a coconut cake.  We will deliver to Mom and Dad in law, sister in law and her husband and my husband's uncle who lives alone and has health problems.  I have been trying to do nice things for people (care packages, cards and just calling/texting) just to be supportive during this weird Covid 19 quarantine time.  I know if it is hard on me, in must be hard on others too, even though we are all still in the thick of it and don't really talk much about that - I think we are all mostly staying positive and all our feelings haven't processed yet - mine haven't!Have a wonderful Easter weekend1"},

Here are four.  The middle forsythia was already there.  Not a place I would have chosen.  But I keep it pretty trimmed.  So, I figure what is 4 more?  I like how it softens the yard and make a welcoming look.  I also planted 2 (1 each side) of driveway and couple flanking my barn in the back yard.  So I guess its closer to 10.  Only 7 large ones tho, 3 small ones.My azalea.  I also have started my veggies.  The square ones mostly planted.  I have seeds and plants I can fill in, I am staging the planting so that they are ready at stages.  The round ones will be 5 nice tomato plants.  2 cherry tomatoes will be in pots on the deck.Well today it is cold and rainy.  So I cleaned the house.  Made DH help me.  I hope you all are staying well and finding nurturing things to do for yourself.  I signed up for an online yoga class and have been doing a few times a week.  It is good.  Oh, my most exciting news...I think I have a job!  Working from home.  Stay tuned for more on that later.  Ta ta."},

I also bought through Amazon a wifi extender to see if I can get internet in our guest room so that I can do yoga online classes in the bedroom - we don't really have room enough anywhere else.  I did a nice session Sunday and Tuesday.  I will do another one Thurs and maybe Friday or Saturday."},

This time of the year is hard for my anyway.  My mom and late husband died in early March.  But this year I was determined not to let this creep into my psyche and overcome this tendency to think about it.  Last year I woke up one morning in late February with a very sore shoulder and it was sore for 2 months!  I even went to the chiropractor.  Maybe that was the beginning of part of my weight gain.  Is it almost inevitable that one gains weight in retirement?  I am really struggling with this.  Maybe that is just the most obvious thing to focus all my frustration on.I also have a couple of friends who are really bringing my down.  I don't want to be friends anymore but I have avoided confrontation for over a year.  I have known these gals since 3rd grade.  Instead of mellowing in middle age, they are getting more judgmental and nosey...and talk about people behind their backs! We have a cancer charity we started in our hometown and we have a fundraiser coming up in May.  I had previously started a charity in my city I used to live in for stray animals, so I helped with the paperwork and 501c3 for this cancer charity.  Now I just want far away from anything these other people are involved in so that I can focus on my mental health.  Maybe the physical will follow my mental health healing.  I do have a chronic autoimmune conditions, so that is a special consideration in my life.My plan is going to unfold as follows.  I will go along for another 3 months as secretary and get through the fundraiser.  Then I will ask for a replacement and ease out.  I think I need to just focus on being retired and in my new state (that I LOVE) and just be still and learn to be alone and no distractions.  I am coming to the belief that these girls do not have my best interests so I am not going to try and have a big talk or get to an understanding of what I want, I am just going to drift.  I tried this last year but one of the girls is always inviting me to church stuff.  The wrinkle is one gal lives 30 miles from me!  Uggggghhhh.  I have owned my house here since 2014.  She just moved last year to be closer to her mom.  Isn't life funny sometimes."},

Whereas in actual fact winter is kind, she points us in her quiet soft way towards our inner self, towards this annual time of peace and reflection, embracing the darkness and forgiving, accepting and loving, embracing goodbye the past year.Winter takes away the distractions, the buzz, and presents us with the perfect time to rest and withdraw into a womb like love, bringing fire & light to our hearth... and then, just around the corner the new year will begin again, and like a seed planted deep in the earth, we will all rise with renewed energy once again to dance in the sunlight-Brigit Anna McNeill"},

I was feeling really good about taking off a few pounds up and even right after Thankgiving.  Then I guess my awareness strayed and I took my foot off the accelerator and I feel I have gained a few - too scared to get on the scale.  I will continue to restart my determination and continue to put effort into looking for recipes that utilize veggies and lean meat and try to continue to avoid sugar.  I have not had much sugar, but I did get a little lax and have enjoyed some potatoes, corn and flour.  When I take these out, I know I will lose, it is just really a focus and intent that I have to really strive for.This weekend will be difficult, my sister and I are driving to the city to see our Granny and our aunts.  We will pick up lunch for Granny.  I will just commit to something like Panera instead of burgers/pasta and we are doing a Mexican restaurant with the aunts, but they have a wonderful vegetarian fajita that I LOVE.  Then Sunday we are beyond excited that my sister's friend gave us Chiefs football tickets and after that a concert - so it will be a full day Sunday.  Monday we drive home and the weather is not thrilling me - chance for rain/snow. So I will be back here next week.  Hope you have a great weekend.  What holiday fun are you all out there planning?"},

Today I froze half and used half the broth to make a yummy soup of sautéed onion, yellow squash and zucchini.  I ALWAYS have to look up how to spell zucchini!  Anyone else?I just flavor it with salt and pepper and rosemary.  Then after it has simmered 30 min and all the veggies all soft and tender, I use the immersion blender to blend it all up.  So good! I gotta get back on the bandwagon of no sweets, less carbs, less processed food.  After all, I am training for Christmas!"},

So, we had to rake through 2 layers of decorative rock and cut through landscaping fabric and move it all to the side to access the roots.  Then we dug and dug and had to cut a bunch of roots, just to get it loose at all.  Then we tried out our winch and it pulled it right out. We then dug a huge hole in a suitable area of our yard and dragged it to the new spot and dropped it in.  Then we went to the nursery to see what sort of decorative small tree they had that we could put in front of our house.  We did not have a lot to choose from, but they had this interesting weeping blue cedar and thought it would look nice.  We just hope it does ok.  I really wanted a Japanese Maple, but the lady at the nursery said they don't like full/all day sun.  So we went with this selection.I like how it does not over power the front of our house (1st photo).Hope you have a great weekend!"},

{"title": "Another Whirlwind Weekend", "date": "Tuesday, October 1, 2019", "text": "Worked on another border area up next to my house, doing the same halfway buried brick type paver border.  Only this entire back border next to house, I am just doing decorative rock.  This area does not have gutters, so there is always an area where the water drips and beats down anything planted here.  Not sure why gutters never put here, but I am not spending the money to do that now.  Also, this border will border on one side, the flagstone patio I am installing in between my deck and back porch foundation.  So, it will look neater and more uniform to include decorative rock here to border the small river rock I am putting around the flagstone for the shallow foundation edges that would make it hard to dig/plant.  I got 1/4 of the work finished yesterday.  My DH was good enough to run and get the 200 additional pavers for me.  I already had gotten 100 last week.  The pavers for all the border and the flagstones will cost less than $400.  The lava rock I got free I am leaving - not wild about it.  But hey it was free and coordinates nicely with the brick foundation trim on the house and the red dyed circle fire pit pad the prior home owners poured and we completed with circular stacked pavers around a metal ring for our big fire pit.I love working in the yard and was disappointed I had to come to work today and could not keep working!  It was high 70's and pretty high humidity yesterday, but that is much better than the high 80's/low 90's we have had mostly lately.  Check out my cute little figs starting on my fig tree!Friday and Saturday there was a huge bike rally in our area of the state, so DH and I took off and had fun Friday and Sat.  Friday we took my convertible to the vendor area and walked around looking.  We bought me a good knife for cutting my apples from a local young man trying to get his start as a knife-smith.  We had a sign on the convertible and some guy asked about my car I am trying to sell - cross your fingers he really is interested.Sat after we mowed the yard (I pulled so many weeds, my hands got tired!) we got the bikes out and rode to a car show and walked around and looked.  It was fun.  Then we stopped and had pizza on the way home.  Sunday I rode to the city with my sister and we helped my Granny in her new place get pictures, mirror, curtains and shower curtains hung.  We are a little concerned that this retirement place has a conventional tub (?!) and a low toilet, but at least there are things you can do to raise the seat up on the toilet.  All in all, my aunt did a good job moving her mother.  Sis and i just helped with the finish work, then drove home 4 hours!Then Monday landscaping and yoga.  I was so tired after yoga, I was asleep in like 5 minutes - 8:40 or so.  For my 2nd to the last 3:30am wake up Tuesday and 4 hour drive to work in the city.  One more week after this one!Hope all you out there have a great week!  Happy October!"},
{"title": "Reflections", "date": "Wednesday, September 25, 2019", "text": "Remember all the free plants I got last spring...more on them later.This week last year we were preparing to leave the extended-stay-hotel-from-hell and leave the city to go permanently to our retirement home.  I remember how excited I was, truly just beyond belief it was happening after counting down what seemed like 10 years but really was more like actual 4 years.  I remember thinking it was all happening so fast and it felt rushed, like events that you have looked so forward to but end up going by in a blur and you try to recall in your memories (and pictures).  Big reason why I started this blog was to document the time getting ready and leading up to such a big change in our lives.Well, fast forward to spring after we retired.  I was restless, we bought a new car, I saw it as leverage to go back to my same work and get a temp assignment, etc.  And here we are approaching 6 months later.  I am giving my notice this week - 2 more week after this week and I am going to enjoy not wearing makeup, packing my lunch, loading my suitcase, etc.  Going to enjoy having a looser schedule and getting my tire body and my complaining tummy back to balance.  Did a stupid thing with my backyard - stacking rocks for a make-shift temp border while we moved our existing azaleas out from house to around the deck.  I plan to put in flagstone area between the deck and the back porch - so the shrubs had to move.  Then I got a bunch of free plants from DH cousin and just put them wherever to keep them alive - but no real plan.  Watered and had great luck with them - but now I want to more formally/permanently situate the landscaping and make it 1)  pleasing to look at but also 2) easier to tend to/mow around.  So I ditched the topple-ing rocks and installed paver bricks length-wise end to end almost flush with the ground/grass to make for easy mowing, while still keeping the grass and plants separate and looking pretty with mulch.  I have a LOT more to do, but I like doing projects.  We are also going to put more insulation in our attic so we look forward to that - not so much, but will be glad to get it done.Last evening I did not go to gym after work.  I drove DH convertible and thought my aunt would enjoy a quick little ride before I go to bed.  She did.  Uncle is failing and feeling badly, but not specifically badly as to be diagnosable in er - no actual pain/fever - just feels crappy all over and his spirits are following along.  She enjoys some company to think about something else.  She had served him dinner and gotten him settled in his chair and off we went, just for a quick spin.  Got a few groceries, I got enough coffee to last 2.5 weeks I have left at the office.We came home and watched our nightly 30 min of TV then I went to bed.  Slept poorly.  Uncle wants the house like an oven, his main complaint at the moment, is, that he is freezing.  It was 75 there last night!  I woke up hot about 4 times!  Poor Uncle, how will he get through the winter.  Happy Fall a couple days late!Project in progress:"},

{"title": "Salad Day", "date": "Tuesday, September 10, 2019", "text": "Just took a break with a friend at work and there was a bunch of left over Greek salad/hummus in the break room - score!  The food was from Zoe's and I just love their Greek dressing!  It had lettuce, tomatoes, diced red onion, feta cheese and Kalamata olives.  So good.Thursday, DH had an appointment in the city early Friday.  So his folks were going to run by and feed the dogs for us, he went to see Granny and I met him over there on my way out of town - to home.  We visited with her an hour and he went on north and I went on south.  He got home Friday after apt and playing golf with is brother.  I enjoyed my house just me and the dogs.  Was nice.  We watched TV in bed!Then Saturday I went to my other friend who passed from cancer (in August) - to his celebration of life.  It was fun driving up with and visiting with my sister.  We took DH convertible.  We also got to see lots of our friends, but it was really draining.Maybe that is why I am just feeling out of sorts.  Sluggish and lethargic.  Plus I am puffy and yucky from eating bad.  I am starting back over on the no sugar thing.  I had gone with out eating red met until Saturday on the way home I stopped for a snack and ended up eating fast food, yuck.  So starting over there too.  Had not eaten red meat for almost a month.  I don't know why I am having so much problem right now eating for wellness.  I went to yoga last night, other than walking and being really busy doing projects around the house (DH mowed without me Saturday - surprised me so much!) I had not worked out officially since last wed yoga - so I went last night and sweated like crazy - then came home - had a light meal and watched tv show - then bed.  I am tired of this schedule, in 3 more weeks I will give my 2 week notice - so 5 more weeks in total.At least it is still in the 90's and hot!  It was good weather to stay in and organize...last weekend I organized and cleaned out my spice cabinet.  This weekend I cleaned out and scoured the freezer part of the fridge - I need to do free standing freezer next weekend.  And we have a nice 8 by 8 ish storage closet off our garage - I cleaned that out, organized and swept the floor/shelves and re-arranged.  Got rid of a carload of knick knacks...and DH is clearing out his giant collection of encyclopedias so we can offer then for sale at his sister's store and empty out several of our bookcases.  We looked at the small yard house(new house) once again and decided that the storage was just so lacking - we could not do it.  So, we are staying in our current house.  But, DH agreed that we could continue to purge.  If we actually considered this house - we must both be in agreement that we could do with less.  So, I am going to continue to pare down excess and DH agreed, because someday we will want to move and find house with smaller yard (and probably less storage).  Mainly right now, I get tired of cleaning around stuff!And for my own part...I am going to store nothing in our attic except 4 Christmas and 2 fall totes.  I told DH I was purging down so much, that if/when we do move, I will easily be able to quickly look and decide what I do NOT need to keep.  Experience, not things is my mantra.  I do not regret that I plan to finish a few cheap money/labor intensive projects around my house that we will get to enjoy and that will make our house and yard look great.  Oh, I forgot to tell this...my friend at work brought me a bag full of pears.  They are really delicious green pears with a pretty thick skin.  I got them all up and put in bags in my freezer for smoothies because they are pretty small just to try to halve.  I made DH and I pear and spinach smoothies and my little $80 bullet from Walmart did great!  We did not detect the skins or the spinach.  I was very happy with my inexpensive blender.  Then, Monday we had peach, apple and banana smoothies and they were yummy.  I am going to get another giant supply of apples this week and so I wanted my apples still in the freezer used up.  Hope you are reaping some great produce as this harvest moon approaches!"},
{"title": "Wayfair Not Such Great Service", "date": "Thursday, September 5, 2019", "text": "Now that I have touted Wayfair, I am pretty mad at them.  I decided that the table that had a small divot out of it, I would request a replacement piece when I requested the drawer bottoms (they were left out) for the coffee table.  Of course by this time, DH has worked hours putting these two pieces together.Today I tested him to see whether the replacement parts have arrived yet.  It is not possible to track their delivery like it was for the original pieces of furniture.  So, I send an instant message to their website...nothing...email...nothing...then after an hour, they respond to a message I put on their Facebook messenger...they will send replacements, but they won't get there till mid September?!  I was so angry - over a month after I order...plus, we have to take the ones apart and put new pieces in.  Geez.Anyway, I am in just a horrible mood.  My tummy has been killing me.  I am going on about a month not enough rest, I will get my friends funeral over this weekend, then hopefully begin to get some relief in a busy, yet stable routine.  And even better, I think I will only work like this in the city for another 6 weeks.  I feel more than ever the need to be home.Have a great weekend!My heart goes out to those affected by the hurricane.  So sad."},
{"title": "Final Wayfair Share", "date": "Tuesday, September 3, 2019", "text": "This weekend I got to see the coffee table I had ordered that DH has assembled while I was working last week.  We were a little disappointed that the bottom shelf panels were missing, but a quick email indicated they would be mailed to us soon.  I realize these things happen, but why don't they mail them back with the same communication/urgency of the original order?  The tabletop had a divet out of it that we tried to patch, but it still did not look great and we were afraid it would not hold up over time - I requested that be replaced too and it has been nearly 2 weeks!  So, for small inexpensive items, mail order has been fine (plus I wanted 3 very specific and small things).  Most furniture you see in retail stores is 1)  expensive!  and 2)  huge.I am overall happy to get exactly what I want, fairly inexpensive and be a little patient/put them together.  This was after I got home from the city Thursday evening and turned around and rode back with my sister.  I really should have stayed home, I was exhausted to the point of needed to nap.  Which is not like me.  We did learn when we stopped to visit our Granny that she is moving.  From an independent living apartment to another closer to her daughter.  She was afraid we would be mad, I don't really understand why she thought I would be mad, I guess because she was not moving closer to me.  I never expected that.  Anyway, she insists on hiring a moving truck (she does not have much, will be $900).  I am grateful for that, because otherwise even though we have cousins in the city, DH and I would have done the majority of the work.  This way my sister and I can take a couple days to help unpack and make her place more of a home.  We are honored to help her.My aunt and unle were so thrilled at my sister's gift of a call-button system.  Very proud and happy.  Nice that my sister can do that for them.  We had a nice lunch with them Sat before we drove back.  So, I was home Sat night, Sunday and Monday.  My sister and I also enjoyed a nice dinner with my girlfriends from the city T and D.  We haven't kept up with D as much, she does not really keep in touch much either, is busy with her grandkids.  Frankly talks about them non stop.  She still indicated she wanted to come down to our house.  Not without T, I will just have to put it off maybe.Sunday DH and I mowed and looked at 2 for sale houses in our little town with smaller yards.  One house over priced and needed a $5000 - $8000 wood fence replaced - PLUS it had 7 giant cut off stumps in the yard - a fairly small yard.  It had been gutted and remodeled beautifully, but lacked these 2 huge items for us - and overpriced.  The other house was brand new - very pretty and I really loved the layout - tiny yard which is ok for us.  But it was REALLY small (not that I care).  Just not sure we are ready to downsize that much this quick.  Then Monday we looked at 2 larger homes 1 old 1 new in nearby higher traffic area.  One had a nice view, the other did not.  Both smaller yards - 1 mostly rock.  DH really hating our huge yard and the mowing.  I offer to do the mowing, he is not willing to have his wife do all the mowing - so it is a quandary for us, somewhat.  We may consider finding room in our budget to hire someone, but it would be $70/week!  We will see.One thing this looking has shown us - we are essentially on the same page - we just want cozy home, to enjoy each other and reduce our focus on stuff.  However, I have been feeling this pull for about 5 years -to reduce my stuff and he seems new to the change - although surprises me sometimes.  Actually 2 things, we both really do feel the happy goal of making sure the other person is happy and satisfied where we are in life and in our retirement...more broadly, in our life journey.  I told DH last night as we were relaxing before I had to get to bed early to get up at 3:45 am - I just care about him, not what we have or where we live.  Plus - we really do love our house.  So, we will probably stay put and enjoy all we have done on the house.  It has been quite a summer indeed."},
{"title": "August is out of here", "date": "Thursday, August 29, 2019", "text": "Can't believe that August is almost over.  This summer has flown by.  I guess that happens when you are really busy.  I made it through yoga class last night even though my friend, T was having leg pain and didn't make it.  She is having bad Charlie-horse type cramping pain and has for a while!  Poor T, I hope she can get some answers and find some relief.I usually treat myself to a bought smoothie Wednesdays after I do yoga.  I make my own on Tues night and most days at noon, that is all I have - smoothie for lunch.  I am tired just thinking about tomorrow - I am going home tonight, unpack and do load of laundry, sleep in my own bed...then tomorrow I ride back up here with my sister for her to visit our granny and see aunt/uncle.  My sister is fixing up aunt/uncle with an I've-fallen-and-can't-get-up button - she works for one of these companies in neighboring state and can monitor it herself.  My granny has one too.I noticed yesterday when looking at my granny's bank account that she has a large debit coming out of her checking - I called her to let her know we are coming noonish Friday to visit and she said we would talk about the transaction I referenced tomorrow.  I think she must have put down a deposit to move closer to her daughter and probably dreads telling me because she knows that my husband and I will do most of the work moving her - but I just want her to be happy.  She will second guess and feel like she has picked lesser of two evils - but when we moved her up here 5 years ago - who would have guessed she would arrive and fly past 100 with flying colors?!  Moving her where we did was the best choice at that time.  Moving again is part of life - we will get it done.  I will assure of all these things.  Of course, we would prefer she move south to be closer to us - but I understand she wants to be near her daughter/my aunt.  If my grandmother outlives her daughter, she will move to our state.Anyway.  DH put together the last piece of furniture I bought - a cute white coffee table with storage.  He said it was like 25 pieces to put together.  And he discovered the drawer bottoms were missing!  UGH.  I sent an email this morning to Wayfair and supposedly they will send the missing panels.  I will let you know.I will be back home Sat evening.  While we are up here, my sister and I are having a nice meal at our favorite shopping area in the city with a couple of my girlfriends who were planning to come down this weekend - but ended up having to cancel because T has an event Saturday with charity she is involved with.  So, I said I would come to them.  Now I dread it because I am so tired.I think the fatigue I am feeling lately is a combination of my driving and working in the city away from DH now for the entire summer, along with some extra running around I have done because of my 2 classmates dying.  So, I am trying to get extra rest and eat well.  Limit my caffeine and junk - eat lots of colorful veggies and fruit.  Lean meat.  No sugar added smoothies.  I have about 6 more weeks and then I will have some much needed downtime.  DH and I were thinking of going somewhere in Oct.  But I am leaning toward not doing much for Oct and Nov, I need to rest.  I hope all of you are looking forward to a wonderful Labor Day weekend!"},
{"title": "New Table", "date": "Tuesday, August 27, 2019", "text": "We had a nice weekend, DH and I went to a concert Sunday.  It was really fun.  It was back up in the city where I am working.  We had to board the dogs, but we had them bathed while there were there and they look nice and smell good.  We had a nice time staying with and seeing my aunt and uncle.  I am glad DH got to see my uncle, he is really slipping last few months.  We also got to play golf with DH 2 brothers.  It was very rainy and cool!  We went by Sat night and saw our former neighbors in the city.  That was nice.  Again, very chilly for August!We got back home Monday morning and it went from chilly and drizzly to 91 and humid in the country!  We mowed Monday afternoon and I had to stop twice to cool off and get some water!  I also watered real well and all my plants I have planted over the spring and summer look so nice!I asked SIL how her plants were doing (she got the other half of the plants in May from her and DH cousin).  She said hers look terrible!  She hasn't had the time to water hers like we have (they own a business and have cattle and BIL works full time).  She said she will be embarrassed if/when cousin comes to town!  Ha.  I also switched out hummingbird food and ate dinner, then went to bed!  On Mondays I go to bed at 8pm to get up Tuesdays at 3:30pm to drive to the city.  Today I am tired, but not too bad.  I will do moderate workout at the gymn after work.  I did yoga for first time in 2 months Wed and Sat and I am still a little sore!  Will not have that big of a gap ever again!Anyway, here is our new table.  We really like it.  We are selling another table and 4 chairs, a set of end/coffee/sofa tables and a leather chair at my SIL vintage resale store.  I wanted something lighter with a pedestal.  The light pedestal is the new one.Have a great Monday!"},
{"title": "New Chair", "date": "Thursday, August 22, 2019", "text": "DH and I have been in our retirement house full time for a year end of September.  Anything that we have bought for the house (not much) we have found second hand mostly.  We brought the favorite things from our city house and got rid of TONS!But looking around, I am seeing a few pieces that I like, but not loving and so I bought 3 new things - AFTER I checked online (FB marketplace), thrift stores and retail stores.  I ordered a new chair for our master bedroom because the leather chair we put in there is too dark and sits too low.  I looked several places and just did not want to pay $200+ for a small chair, but my wants for this chair were specific enough, so I went with new.  As you can see, the corner is small and dark.  Taking out the dark chair and putting in the smaller white chair will really brighten this corner.  I have a couple more I will share next week, as I get them.Hope you have a great Thursday and weekend beyond!"},
{"title": "Do I Have a Story For You!", "date": "Wednesday, August 21, 2019", "text": "So, I mentioned insurance companies briefly yesterday's post...perfect time to unleash this story!So, for 15 years I slaved away and toiled and gave my blood, sweat, tears and the prime time of my life (and child bearing years) to my career.  It happened to be for a Fortune 100 Insurance Company.  Let's call them BIC (Big Insurance Company).The parting ways was very negative (another LONG story I am too tired to write about now).  I was devastated.  I will elaborate someday soon - maybe after my short term working gig is over this fall.I moved on...I was married (bad marriage) to a guy who inherited a very successful agency business from his father.  A huge \"book\" of business of loyal insurance clients.  In insurance, when you sign up people and secure policies - you get a commission and kickbacks as long as they are signed up with you.  So, I decided to learn they sales side of it in his office and then open a 2nd office.  So, I worked in his office, learned the systems they had in place, the basics about running an office and went about getting my formal training from insurance company #2.  We will call them IC2.  Another positive factor for me was the fact that I have legal background and claims background, so I already knew much about coverage and the features that enhance protecting one's assets, etc.  I went a week in Denver - ALL my expenses I covered.  I was in a class with about 40 other similar-prospective agents-in-training.  Then a week in Chicago.  Then another week in Denver.  All along, IC2 is working with prospective agents hand in hand (setting up business plan, doing paperwork to set up legal entity with respective state, picking locations and signing leases, getting stationary/envelopes, arranging for signage, etc.).  Needless to say, this process costs THOUSANDS of dollars for everyone - the company PLUS the prospects.  PLUS I am forgoing income for about a year getting this all set up.  Part of the way IC2 gets new agents (besides being very hands-on for the first couple of years in setting everything up) is to offer financial incentives for certain sales goals, etc.  They even offered me a free \"book\" of business, after the successful opening of my office, I would \"own\" this book.  If EH (ex-husband - sorry, spoiler alert) agency were strictly in numbers, figure his business did about $400,000 a year - not directly translated into income for him - that is much more complicated math.  But, his book probably included about $400,000 revenue in premiums for a year for IC2.  Mine was about $50,000 that IC2 \"gave\" me.  But, hey, I will take it, you know?So I spend thousands getting my company up and running, I hire 2 people and we are all trained and working hard.  I even transferred my 401(k) to my own \"book\" and took a very nice commission on it to benefit my numbers.  The problem was - that I was in my early 40's and stuck in a 10 year product that makes like nothing (and transversely - loses nothing).  So, this investment vehicle has virtue for people who are older and risk intolerant - but a very BAD idea for younger person who needs their saved money to grow.Anyway, I work at this business for about a year I get the nice bonus promised - low five-figures.  But, keep in mind I have not worked for A YEAR - No INCOME!  Then, IC2 comes to me and says, \"yeah, we know you completed and turned in a business plan that we approved...but we are ending this partnership - we don't want you to run your business this way that you planned\".  My business plan included half insurance sales and half legal free-lance.  THEY initially agreed to it, just to get me to commit!I was stunned and incredulous.  So, I went back to them and said if they would let me sell the book they gave me and give me a settlement, I would sell and get out.  They agreed.  I sold the business that I spent a year setting up for mid-five figures.  OK, that was pretty good.  And remember that bonus?  Well, they paid me twice by accident.  HAHA.  But the icing on the cake - they paid me a settlement.  So, I ended up about the same bottom line, as if I had worked for my prior insurance company for a year.  I did feel bad about having to let my 2 employees go, but one woman was wanting to open her own company - which she did with A DIFFERENT insurance company, after seeing what IC2 did to me...and the other employee was having a lot of personal and health problems and wanted to get a less stressful (not sales-based) job - which she did right away.  I asked my tax guy about the taxes and he said IF IC2 sent a 1099 to the IRS, I would have to file income tax on that settlement money.  Well, guess what?  On the settlement I negotiated, they never 1099'd it so I did not have to pay taxes.  How is that for sweet revenge against them changing the rules and pulling the rug out from under me?!  Today I work in a job that is very low stress and OK revenue and I feel like I was VERY lucky in the long run.  I did all this mentioned above with ZERO debt!  All this money I invested and went out and immediately got a W2 job.  Thank GOD!IC2?  Well, they are going strong.Another agent I know of bought a book to the tune of mid-six-figures and is now working furiously to make it float.  I know the agent he bought it from because she bought mine - and she was dirty.  Trying to pull things, so I know she probably cheated him too.  I am so grateful I did not borrow any money (Thank you Jesus).The moral of this story?  I was so angry at this company that I had my annuity moved away from them - TO ANOTHER ANNUITY.  Can you say cut off my nose to spite my face?  Oh well, when the 10 years came up and I could move my six-figure retirement account to another company - the agent on record was the same executive that I had battled with YEARS earlier.  It was very satisfying to tell them that even if they were the last company on earth I could invest my money with - I would take my chances with putting it under my mattress!!!!!!!!!!"},

And though you might think the phrase comes from worn-out, overheated pups laying lazily in the sun, too hot to play even one round fetch, you’d be incorrect. Turns out, the phrase “dog days of summer” has very little to do with dogs at all. According to Christopher Klein of The History Channel, the phrase dates all the way back to ancient times, when civilizations tracked the seasons by sky patterns. During the hottest days of the summer, ancient Romans and Greeks noticed that Sirius—the brightest star in the sky—set and rose alongside the sun. And as Jay Holberg, the author of Sirius:  Brightest Diamond in the Night Sky, explains, Sirius is known as the “dog star” because it’s the brightest star in constellation Canis Major, which literally translates to “greater dog” in Latin.Since Sirius moved in tandem with the sun during this time of immense heat, ancient civilizations believed the star was radiating all that extra heat to planet Earth. The Romans, therefore, referred to the phenomenon as “diēs caniculārēs,” which translates to “dog days.”Thanks to advances in modern science, we now know that though Sirius is indeed the brightest star in the sky, it’s more than eight light-years away from the Earth. One light year, per the scientists at NASA, equates to nearly six trillion miles. For comparison’s sake, NASA puts our own sun as 92 million miles away from the equator. You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to tell that Sirius is way, way too far away from our solar system to contribute a single joule of heat to Earth.Additionally, our dog days are hardly the same dog days of ancient eras. The Old Farmer's Almanac says the current precise dog days of summer fall between July 3 and August 11. The ancient Romans and Greeks, however, are said to have experienced their dog days starting in late July. What’s more, as the universe shifts and changes and shrinks and expands at a never-ending rate, Sirius changes locations in the night sky.“In 26,000 years, the dog days would completely move all around the sky,” Bradley Schaefer, a professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University, told National Geographic.   “Roughly 13,000 years from now, Sirius will be rising with the sun in mid-winter.”Wow, I love stuff like this.  I hope you get a chance to see the stars in between the fireworks this weekend.  And have the love of family and friends around you.  Today I am going to lunch with my aunts, it is my Aunt C birthday.  And later I get to see my DH and my dogs.  Can't wait!  Friday we go to Sam's - good times.  And Saturday I spend with my sister's family.  I already told her I was going to bring the 7 layer dip.  Now I am seriously wanting some - I am making a dairy free version.Have a great holiday!Speaking of dogs, this is me and my dogs in our closet when a bad storm came through this spring."},

I am finding myself not feeling peaceful which makes me overspend and overeat.  Plus I find myself easy to find fault with DH behaviors so I dont have to address mine.So I have decided that I just need to focus on me and make a few minor tweaks and then maybe I can affect bigger concentric rings of home, career, money, weight. I went to a good yoga class yesterday in which we were reminded of the importance of meditation.  The practice of yoga is to be in our bodies, not just up in our heads.  To accept what really is and soften and be ok with it,  rather than constantly swim upstream.   The cornerstone of contentment is gratitude.   Yoga leads to unintentionally tuning in, living in the moment and being grateful.The goal is to become more aware for period of time each day longer than we are actively moving.  The instructor said even 5, 20, 25 min a day will lead to big change.So I am starting with 15 min each morning before I mindlessly turn on the TV or jump online."},

I cleaned windows and cleaned out the small sedan we are selling to nephew.  DH making a few updates to his new sedan.  We are staying at 3 cars for now.  I feel more comfortable with 3.  4 too many to care for.  I still overall wish for downsizing, but I have to compromise, as DH not there yet.I have listed 28 mini formal purses and 7 regular purses for my sister in law on Poshmark.  She is working to get her retail store opened.  Second hand finds.  Not antique, definitely not flea market.  More of a unique second hand store, she has carefully curated over the years.  Some stuff antique that she used to display as a museam in the small town library.  New city counsel did not agree with her vision, even though our little town saw many people come just to see the \"museum\" she arranged.  The library really too big for our town, she had entire 2nd flour totally done up in a wonderful living museum of anything from 40's to 70's kitchen, office, living room...luggage and personal effects.  Even planes, trains and automobiles.  Animal taxidermy donations.  Quite a bunch to see and enjoy.  Now I understand that she has retired, it is essentially empty.  Why?!  Small towns need to attract people to keep vibrant and alive, infuse commerce into the small business owner just trying to survive.Today, I listed her purses...they do better with wider electronic/Facebook marketplace audience.  As do clothes, shoes...maybe costume jewelry.  But I think she will bring in some traffic.  I hope for her sake.  She and BIL trying to navigate adjustment of retirement/semi retirement...so are DH and I...more on that later.Oh well, off to do a 6 mile walk with hiking people.  Then visit my friend briefly.  I need to discuss some concerns I have about a family member (cousin N) sure how to talk about yet.Have a great Sunday!  Beautiful and sunny here!  But cool."},

As colonel leading a state militia, in 1776 he prevented the British from taking Charleston, and Fort Moultrie was named in his honor.   -WikipediaThis was our morning yesterday, walking around this beautiful area.  We had driven there from Savannah.  We considered staying a night or two in Charleston.  I wish we had.  But we were missing our dogs pretty bad and drove on home after a quick (too quick) dash around Charleston, stopping at this park and one other little park.We came to Charleston after we drove from Savannah, GA.  On Thurs last week, we took the dogs to dog boarding and drove from Arkansas down through Texarkana over through Shreveport and over to Alexandria, LA and stopped for the night.  The next day we drove through Baton Rouge and stopped at couple stores, bought a shirt.  Then we drove on to Florida and down into Tampa were we have friends.  We stayed there a couple of nights and while there, we went in their boat through the Alafia river and Tampa Bay.  We went to an island in Tampa Bay, Fantasy Island.  We collected shells and walked the path through and around the island.  Then the Alafia.  We were enjoying just idling and visiting.  Having lovely weather and soaking up the sun, looking at all the neat houses.  Then we approached a couple other boats stopped and a couple of kayakers.  They pointed out Manatee!  We counted 15 or more.  They were just skimming along the edge, eating vegetation and easing up for air and just floating gracefully.  It was amazing.  We also saw an alligator sunning on a log.  It was about 5 or 6 feet long.  The first time, i am pretty sure for seeing an alligator and i know the first time seeing manatee. We had a nice seafood dinner and had breakfast out Sunday before we took a little hike and then loaded the car to head on up the coast.  We drove through Orlando and Daytona and on up through Jacksonville to where we stayed in Savannah.  It was a great vacation.The only thing I would change, is staying a couple days in Charleston and not driving all the way 1200 miles from Charleston to home in a single setting, but my husband gets the need to be home and just hightails it.  He used to do it when we toured on motorcycles too.  I guess it is just something i need to deal with.I drove from Charleston all the way up, just south of Columbia SC, through Augusted, GA then all the way through Atlanta and to Birmingham.  We were doing to stay for the night there, but DH says \"Oh, why don't i just drive us to Tupelo\"?  So, then we get there and he says, \"OK, Memphis\".  Before we got to Memphis, i was like \"We are going all the way in one drive, aren't we\"?  We pulled into our drive 4am.Our bed felt great!  We slept till 10 am and the picked up the dogs.  He spent the day washing the car we drove and i did laundry, unpacked and cleaned windows.  Hey, spring cleaning!Hope you have a great rest of your Wednesday.  See you Thursday.  We are going to dig up some ivy at my inlaws and take them some grapefruit we picked from my friends' yard."},

She was going to come down the weekend of my birthday, last weekend, but she had to make up for some time away from work.  She had the flue bad enough, she had to go the er.I look forward to talking to her about that and about yoga.  We started yoga together about 7 years ago.  I also look forward to talking about doing a yoga retreat next year.  And going back to the city first week of April and going to our old yoga studio together.  I am glad I am skipping yoga today, my shoulder continues to be really persistent in giving me pain and numbness.  I have been the to chiro twice, and will go couple more times before our road trip next week.Another thing I look forward to is talking to her about what I am struggling with a little bit.  I will talk about it here in the future.  I have not talked to another person, except my sister.  This is sort of related to me having my bike listed for sale.  I want to continue to condense our \"stuff\", liquidate and focus on having some fun experiences.  Sometimes I feel like DH is with me, sometimes I feel like he wants other things.He did dig deep and agree to list some extra things, like some expensive watches, a couple sets of gold clubs and an expensive coat.  But he continues to shop and it makes me feel very uncomfortable.  If he is just shopping to curate and condense, I am ok.  If he is not being honest about just condensing what we have and curating, but continues to aimlessly shop we will have a big problem.  Even doing that, frustrates me because he shows no such enthusiasm for doing things, improving his health or home related stuff.  I shop too, but I have the same enthusiasm for home projects, working in the yard, setting up our garden, hiking, crocheting, yoga, etc. We both spend too much time on our phones!  Lol.  Well, I do have to remember that things don't change overnight.  This is a big adjustment and I am trying to be patient for one year.

When the recreation therapist and the guy in charge came over to say hello, he had a microphone and asked if DGM wanted to say anything about how she made it so long.  Well my Granny gets that microphone and says...\"Well if you don't want to live to 100 you better start drinking and smoking...I never did that\".  It was pretty funny.DH and I playing golf today.  It is gray and spotty rain, but should not amount to much.  Tomorrow is my birthday and I am doing yoga and then I think I am either going to steak place or to the casino for dinner.  I might even play $40 worth of slots.  You know, live dangerously."},

I am enjoying the newly crisp white cleanness of the newly painted baseboards/quarter round.  It looks so nice!This week I roasted up some veggies with garlic, olive oil and a drizzle of lime juice and sprinkled on a bit of Cajun seasoning.  Today I will cook a couple chicken breasts with pesto to go with them.  We usu do smoothies for lunch, but on yoga days, I eat a real food lunch.  We are trying to eat more veggies and less meat.  While DH will never be meat free, I am reducing meat portions, increasing lean meats and fish and being more diligent about the source of our meat.  I.e. local game, grass fed beef and free range chicken and eggs.DH has lost 20 pounds and his doctor is astonished at the progress in his blood work numbers.  I am having a tryingFeb.  After my early Feb road trip, my stomach was out of whack, then I got a head cold/sinus infection and Tuesday I threw my back out.  Just from bending over wringing out the mop!  I know I will be back on track soon.  That is why I skipped Wed night yoga, I did walk the pup so I enjoyed the sunshine yesterday.  More cold rainy weather to come Saturday.It is late February, after all.  But we are planning our road trip to the beach mid March.  Right after my grandmother's birthday.  SHE IS TURNING 100!  March 6.  Cannot believe it.  How blessed I am."},

{"title": "Friends", "date": "Wednesday, January 30, 2019", "text": "Friends have always been important to me.  I have a sister who is 4.5 years younger than I.  She and I have always gotten along and had each other's backs, but we are pretty different in our interests and temperment.As the oldest child, I was very much about trying to be the perfect child, doing chores without fail, helping around the house, keeping my room clean, being neat and tidy and quiet.  Getting good grades and working as soon as I was old enough to babysit and do odd jobs.My sister I will just say...she is very laid back.  Her half of our shared room was always in chaos and she was always procrastinating.  We are still much like this now.  I grew up, went to college, always working more than one job, excelling at my grades, climbing the corporate ladder.  While I was focusing on career, my sister was getting married and having kids.  She has 2 children.  A daughter and a son.  She works for a non profit and her husband does odd jobs.  They are on a very tight budget.  I am on a budget, now that we are retired.  She is on a really tight budget.  I don't know how she does it.Last night we all went out to celebrate niece and BIL birthdays in January.  This is the first time in over 20 years that my sister and I live in the same state.  So, it was neat to be there.  To spend time with that part of my family.  DH and I had sort of a rough day, so to be able to accomplish showing up was important, because earlier in the day I had wished I could stay home.  I sat near niece and her husband.  He seems like a nice guy, he just talks nonstop.  He told me last night that he had Asbergers (sp?) and so he does not read social cues and he just looks directly at me and talks the entire time and I was hoping we would all have more of an entire table conversation, so that I could participate with my nephew too, who lives an hour and a half away.Since I got home Saturday night late, I have been sick with stomach troubles.  I truly think it was because I was run down and tired.  On top of that I have been sick with worry over my 2 high school friends with cancer and my cousin with cancer.  I have tried to be supportive and it has taken a little bit of a toll on me.  Maybe just sort of withdrawing and relaxing is just what I needed. I also have a friend who is struggling with mental illness, RT.  She did not find the ability to be at our reunion Saturday and I understand.  Plus, she is not as close as I am to the circle of friends who are the 2 with cancer.  This friend has had a very trying couple of years with her mental illness.  I think she is doing better now. Another thing I want to blog about is my friend who just got out of prison 4 months ago, TC.  He actually drove the 3 hours back to his hometown to be at our reunion and we were all just in awe of his journey.  He grew up in the same small town I grew up in, with the mental health friend.  They were very close. The town we went to school in, was 9 miles away.  So we all went to one elementary school together and in 3rd grade went to the other school with all of us who eventually went to high school.  NS and LH both went to the other school.  My friend SL who passed away from a heart problem in 2014 is another one of my longest friends, I had known her since we were 3. NS and LH I have come to know more since we grew up.  Couple of my other friends from school invited me to a Christian Women conference this weekend.  I was pretty much looking forward to it, but I have some feelings from one of these friends, DW, that she and I do not really have much in common.  I find her moody and sullen and she is constantly on her phone.  This summer she texted me in a group text with the other Christian Women's Conference friend, BB that she was coming to the city where I worked and would call me for dinner.  I was very encouraged.  Well, that night I texted DW and she did not return my text.  She ignored me and I was hurt by it.  There is no way she did not get my text - she is on her phone constantly and constantly on social media.  So no way I am thinking she did not see my text.  But I let that go and was open to try to get reacquainted along with BB, our friend in common.  Well, something happened this weekend and I don't know how to deal with it.  So I am grateful for this format to write about it...At the reunion, TC (out of prison 4 months) said he was going to visit RT for dinner this coming week.  I said that was great and I knew RT would be happy to see TC and I just tried to keep things light and positive.  What does one say to one who has been in prison 30 years and just got out 4 months ago, right?!Then TC looks at me and asks \"I heard RT husband was a &*^$$%^! (expletive).  I was stunned.  I did not know what to say.  I said how I felt about RT husband, different in some ways, not a &*^$$%^!  I could not believe it.  I have genuine fondness and compassion for RT spouse, as he is a really stand up guy and has been through a lot with RT.On the way home, my sister and I rode with BB and her husband.  I relayed this part of my conversation and she said that a couple of days earlier when she and DW (the one I don't care too much for), that they had seen TC, that DW said \"my husband would call RT husband a &*^$$%^!  I was floored.  I just sat there and later I had a good cry.  DW and BB supposed to be working on their Christian journey and sometimes I feel like I am their project.  And then this happens?!  About a seriously ill friend and I just don't know how to handle it.  How DW and BB can be so involved and vocal about their compassion and good works in Christianity, yet they distinguish between cancer and mental illness/addiction, I guess?  I also had some uncomfortable conversation with BB about how hard it is going to be to lose such close friends if they die.  I reminded her that I already knew, because in 2014 I lost my friend SL to heard disease.  BB was not friends with SL, so she really hasn't lost a contemporary yet.  It is really hard.  Then BB and I had a difficult conversation about Christianity (my DH will not go to church).  I think I found a church I am going to try and see if I like it.  I told her that DH had a problem with organized religion and she said \"that's just a cop out\".  Uh, OK.  Again, not a real effective way to discuss something that someone else does not believe in.  Guess it is a good thing I am not assigned to recruit!  hahahaSo, I cry all the way home and I thought a good night sleep would be helpful.  And I talk about it all to DH and am in anguish that I don't want to go to a women's Christian conference with these too.  How could they be so judgmental and lack compassion for a fellow classmate who has mental/addiction issues is bad enough...but to spread such yuck to TC newly out of prison just has me sick, literally physically and heart sick too.DH told me to decide Wed or Thurs and just bail out.  I am no where closer today than I was Sat night about how to handle it.  I could just drift away and make some distance, or I can go, listen to the message they are so enthused about going to and then, with love and constructive feedback, inform them how I feel and see if they come around.  Then I can drift if nec.  The upside, we all come away with a little more understanding and compassion.  And I can drift anytime I need to.  The downside is, I have no friends down here in my new state.  But I know I will meet people someday and maybe people who are more compassionate and less judgmental is a good place to start!"},

One year, approx. 2011 or so,  federal employees were furloughed and he made approx. 25% less that year.  It was stressful for us and that was with me working.  So we were a 2 income household.  We trimmed the fat, that was when I started making DH lunch every day (he used to eat out most lunches) and we sold one of our more expensive vehicles.  But it was otherwise, not felt too severely by us.  We are flexible and able to adjust.Some people may feel such a budget shortfall more severely.  Other households may just have one working adult, or have dependent children, or debt, etc.  People should not be expected to work without pay.  It is wrong.  States preclude such situations, calling it involuntary servitude.  A euphemism. I am sure this is far from over.  I am sure that this is not the last time such a \"shutdown\" will happen.  But it is wrong for the working people to be so adversely affected by the choices of our elected officials who have no idea what it feels like to wonder how you are going to pay for childcare, or gas to get to work or food.

{"title": "Keeping Score", "date": "Saturday, December 29, 2018", "text": "It was a nice coincidence this morning that my inspirational emails were both about similar thing.  Motives and Keeping Score.  Maybe the true coincidence is timing.Spending a lot of time with family can leave one feeling a lot of emotions.  I myself feel a lot of emotions.  Esp this year.  Maybe because we are retired and i do not have the distractions of work and career.  Maybe because I always miss my mom during the holidays.  Maybe because of the evolution of social media.  It is easy to fall into the pattern of comparing oneself.  One of my friends calls it comparing my insides to others outsides.  I suppose I still do that.  Its probably human nature.  I have some friends who are fully involved in social media.  I have some friends who fervently avoid it.  I try to keep a happy medium.  Enjoy the keeping in touch aspect, follow some bloggers and fashion instagrams, connecting with others I might not otherwise, seeing peoples families grow up.  Some groups on Facebook that I get a lot of inspiration from.  But avoid the negative pitfalls...There are a lot of them:  comparison, gossip, judgment, fakeness, superficiality, time wasting...not to mention the things I might be accomplishing if I were not on social media.  But I do find myself having much more free time now...And actually I am on social media less often that when I was bored at work all day. Anyway, back to the score keeping.  It basically goes to the hard of one's motives.  The gift giving aspect of Christmas is very much deserving of at least a consideration of our motives.  That is an entire separate discussion.  I went to Silver Dollar City with a friend and her mom and sister Thursday.  It was really nice.  We walked around and looked at the shops and went to a musical.  Then we took in the lights and the lights were fantastic!  I got to watch a bit of glass blowing and pottery spinning.  I loved it.  Just the drive alone was breathtaking!  I also enjoyed the company and conversation.  My friends' mom commented that her neighbor brings them lost of baked treats.  And if they take her something, she immediately gives something in return.  I know a couple of relatives like that.  I think I am a little like that.  It is positive, I want to do nice things for others, esp when they have done something for me.  But the real reason we do for others is because that is what love is.  I will not really change my attitude toward this, but I will be mindful of my motives and most importantly, not expect anything back. Many things are changing now that we are retired.  One of those things is plenty of time for reflection.  This time of the year I seem to take some time to reflect more.  It will be interesting to see how this is New Years time goes now that I am less busy.  I think the big difference is that I am looking forward to a new year more than ever.  I am looking forward to doing more things with DH.  Big things like travel and new interests, but even just fine tuning our day to day routine.  He is gone all weekend hunting and I really miss him.  No deer yet, but he is going to stay until Monday if he still has not gotten one.  I want him to enjoy himself, but I don't really want another deer.  One is plenty.  I guess we will just be generous if he gets another.  He does want to be home to ring in the New Year with his baby.  Until then, we are limited to sending emails and PM (on social media - how ironic!)Hope you all are having a great weekend.  Are you thinking of the New Year?  Any big plans?  Small plans?  Mindfulness or intentions?  I usually pick a word.  Mine is \"receive\".  I chose a very passive word intentionally.  I am changing already!"},

I pray that I may live as though my mind were a reflection of the Divine Mind.Hazelden FoundationMy emotions are tied to my past, I feel like.  So, since I have never been retired before, I wanted to approach it out of honesty and not a picture of what others had told me or what I felt was right because of competing emotions I might not fully understand.  After getting our house, finances, cars and paperwork like insurance, licenses, property taxes, bank accounts, address changes all sorted out...it has been our goal to take it real easy this winter.  Essentially work on our mental health...and physical.  DH has lost about 15 pounds and I have lost just a few, maybe 5 pounds.  But we are trying to focus on eating a balanced diet and not eating too much.  I specifically am trying to eat more vegetables.For a week now, after we drink our coffee we don't eat till 11 or 12.  Look up the effects of intermittent fasting on our bodies and how we make more HGH if we stop eating at night and don't eat again for 12-16 hour later.  I swear this is helping us immensely.  DH and I both have inflammation type chronic conditions.  I have researched vitamins, herbs and minerals I have been so sick in the past during my working years that I did not know how I was going to keep working.  Vitamins, minerals, herbs, smaller meals, no dairy and at times full elimination diet have turned my health around.  I take a very expensive probiotic that made the biggest single impact.  I also take a digestive enzyme.  DH does not take this, but he eats more veggies than I ever have and he is taking cod liver oil, vitamin C and D with me and he is seeing results in his cholesterol and has stopped the omeprazole.  Thank you Jesus.  That stuff is linked to many issues and they are even saying possibly dementia.It is nice to be able to make a fresh home cooked meal at leisure at least once a day from fresh ingredients.  Yesterday I roasted in the oven 1 large butternut squash, 2 acorn squash, 2 onions, 1 sweet potation and 1 regular potato.  I spread out about 6 - 10 garlic cloves and drizzled with olive oil.  Sprinkle with sea salt.  Bake at 400 for 45 - 60 min.  I also separated all the seeds and roasted them with salt and pepper.  Then I let the vegetables cool slightly, scooped all the insides out, put it all together in a soup pot and simmered with about 6-8 cups of broth.  Then I added sprinkle of cayenne pepper and double sprinkle of curry powder (not sure how DH would like this) and some black pepper.  Then I pureed it with my immersion blender.  I use this gadget all the time.  mostly to blend soups.  But you can also whip cream, make pudding and smooth gravy with it.  He LOVED this soup!  We did garnish with the toasted seeds and some vinegarJust holding steady is a victory for me, given my activity level and stress are way down.  But this will be 3rd week of 2 yoga classes and I will be golfing today.  I used to just force myself to do yoga or workout classes right after work.  It is much harder going after a day relaxing at home.  But I am adapting. What are you going to do today to take care of yourself?"},

Day 30", "date": "Friday, November 30, 2018", "text": "Probably.   Maybe this is a pattern.  Maybe it is progress, because I am trying like heck not to consider myself center of the universe.   Trying to think of others...Really would like help on this...What do you think?  Have similar experience?  How did you handle?One of my childhood friends has terminal cancer.  Saturday, in our hometown about 2.5 hours away, there is a fund raiser for him.  My sister and I are going.  I have a couple other friends who are going.  We all live south.  2 of us gals said \"Oh, let's ride together...!\" Friend 1 says if we take your big SUV, we will chip in for gas.   I thought it would be fun.  Then DH tells me it will be a pain to remove the tarp he has put down for \"carpet\" and load the rear 3rd row seat, but he will help me. Then I texted the one friend about a week ago to ask what time we should leave...she did not answer the time question...talked about couple other things...This is partly the problem with texting, I know, I know...Then Thursday she calls and leaves a message that she and her husband sold a washer/dryer and have to go to storage unit on the way.  This is in the town they just moved from about halfway.  Friend 2 still lives in that town.   Asked if that was ok, or if I prefer to just take 2 vehs...leaves that message.I think she has to know, I would not care at all.  I have a garage full of her sister's shoes I am trying to sell to help her and sister.  Would I mind such a minor detour?  Then it occurred to me...maybe other friend voiced that they would just prefer to make arrangements...I dont know, it just seemed weird to me.  A month ago these 2 friends went to a concert and only invited me last minute, when her mom had to miss to care for her ailing spouse.  I did not go, because of my dogs.  DH was deer hunting.  Of course, a month before that I mentioned I was going to go deer hunting with DH.  So that could be why I was not invited to concert earlier.I text and give her an \"out\".  I tell her to call.  She does not call.  This morning I get a group text all 3 of us.  Friend 3 asking about meeting.  I reply saying friend 1 and I had brief chat, arrangements not finalized, etc.  Send photo of buried SUV 3rd row seat.  Tell friend 1 to call...several hours have gone by. I asked DH about tomorrow, he suggested I just go with my sister in separate car and not deal with the situation.   Because there is no way for me to know.  I would rather err on the side of saying, no big deal, we will all meet there.  Than wonder if the girl doesn't really want to be around me and feel uncomfortable. This summer us 3 gals were on group text and friend 2 said she was going to be in my city for a conference.  I was surprisingly hopeful...then as the evening progressed, I texted her and she never answered.  I thought it was rude, but I said nothing to her or friend 1.These 2 friends were here back in September,  when we went to see pup we adopted week later.  I did mention to friend 3 and friend 4.  They did not really understand how to interpret friend 2 ignoring me either.  But I should not make assumptions.  They both ssid I should have a talk with her about it.  I may.  But it should be done in person.  And this fundraiser weekend is NOT the time.  This friend 2 who ignored my text is the one who took my cat and also the one I gave all my furniture to in the city (couch, love seat, chair ottoman).  They did come pick it up, granted.  But they did it on a weekend we were gone. Even if I am overthinking.  I just prefer not to work so hard.  I have found true friendship to be not so much work.  That people who want to see you, see you.  I am not wiling to spend precious energy here.Now, what to do about it.  My work buddy back in the city...he called it the \"drift\".  He \"drifted\" away from many family and friends when he moved from West coast city to 200 acres in the Midwest.  I think I will start there...I can always talk later. Beautiful day again today.  Spend some time outdoors again.  Have a great Friday!Today I am grateful for my serenity and my tools.  I can pick up my toys and go to another sandbox.  Give it some time before I do anything.  Namaste my friends out there!  I appreciate you!"},

I was irritated at DH because his GP suggested upper gi and colonoscopy.  not this.  DH opted to go to blood specialist first.   Did DH not think this would be important to tell me?  Then again, maybe he did and I forgot.

More later.  Please send positive energy if you don't pray, prayers if you do.  I am grateful for other's prayers and I am grateful for our 60 days."},

Maybe as a little girl or even a grown woman who desperately wishes her daddy would love her, an employee who longs for the approval of her boss, a woman who would give anything if her husband would pay attention to her, or one whose husband has walked away. Maybe you feel forgotten by friends or family during the busy holiday season, and loneliness and painful emotions threaten to steal your joy...When we find ourselves feeling this way, we’re faced with two choices. We can turn away from God in anger and frustration and develop a sour attitude. Or we can allow the words of the psalmist to motivate us to step up in our faith...Psalm 43:3, “Send out your light and your truth; let them guide me. Let them lead me to your holy mountain, to the place where you live...If you’re feeling forgotten, by others or by God, let your hope swell and your joy return by intentionally believing that God will never leave you and is always by your side. Make a commitment to focus on God’s presence and the blessings He’s given you, and let God be the source of your joy...Dear Lord, I’ve been feeling...alone in this world...Forgive me for doubting, and fill my heart with the joy of Your presence. I commit today to seek after You, put my hope in You and praise You even when I’m struggling. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.\"   -Tracie Miles This really resonated with me today.   If have felt lonely and lost in my life...I developed bad coping strategies.  I persevered at my poor choices...I learned I can also make better choices...and preserver in the those.  Today, I try to remain hopeful, grateful and help others.  My feelings change like the weather in the midwest.Wish me luck as we play golf in the wind today.  Cold front is coming in and all day temps will be dropping.Have a wonderful Sunday.  Spoil yourself just a little today.  Start with a thought.Day 25, I am grateful for perspective."},

Then, I took down the old tattered lace curtains and put privacy film on the dormer windows into the attic.  It look really good now.  Then we had leftovers and fresh biscuits for dinner and I cooked up the meat for our lasagna today.Here is attic windows before and after.  The difference is not clear in photos.  In person, it looks much nicer, cleaner and updated.Today will be just quiet Thanksgiving.  Just us, DH family celebrates Saturday.I have a lot of heaviness on my heart from some family and friends battling sickness and loneliness.  I just pray for all of you out there to have some light in your heart today and remember that whatever we feel heaviness about is only temporary.  Reach out and you will receive.

There's another that can fill our hearts and minds. Anxiety. Guilt. Regret. Those are my bedtime companions. The foes of a soul not at rest.\"  -Katrina V. WylieThe phrase that caught my eye:  \"boundaries are not burdens\" they are gifts.Especially helpful after my trip back to family in the city this past weekend. Just ran to the store and stocked up.  I may have to go again to help with DH family dinner Sat.  But I got my shopping done and got what I was planning to fix and bring.  Sat night SIL told me that her mom told her she is not doing the majority of the holiday meals this year.  And SIL said she and I are doing, and that Christmas dinner might be at my house.  Sure would have been nice to have been privy to this discussion.  I told DH and he just shook his head.  Seems like a bad year to change everything, why not wait until SIL is retired next year.  Oh, well.  I will just roll with it.I will talk more about my anxiety later.  Not ready yet.  I am still dealing with adjusting to my new life in retirement and the huge money adjustment that goes with that.  I know everything will work itself out. Just one foot in front of the other.  I will send some of that energy out in yoga tonight.  Have a great Monday!  Day 19 and I am grateful for yoga."},

While DH mowed with big mower, I dug up whole line of large rocks along one side of the house.  Now We are relaxing our tired muscles and I am enjoying a cup of pumpkin coffee with pumpkin coconut creamer.Internet provider (#2) could not get wiring at our house to work, so he has to come back Friday.  Since we waited for him today, I still haven't grocery shopped or taken our large bag to thrift store. If we can get dryer to work tomorrow, I will consider it a victory week. We also gave up on trying to get trimmer started.  We are going to ask DH BIL if he will look at it for us.  Today was sort of frustrating,  but yard is mowed now and those stupid rocks are gone.Joy is not a constant. It comes to us in moments - often ordinary moments. Sometimes we miss out on the bursts of joy because we're too busy chasing down the extraordinary moments. Other times we're so afraid of the dark we don't dare let ourselves enjoy the light. A joyful life is not a floodlight of joy. That would eventually become unbearable.

{"title": "10 Things I Have Learned from Staying 3 Months in an Extended Stay Hotel", "date": "Wednesday, September 26, 2018", "text": "1.  Not having a house to take care of leads to less stress.  We were high on the relief of selling our city house and I thought that relief would carry us farther.  It lasted less than a week, adjusting to reality of the challenges of the hotel.  But over all, that relief has been profound after having 2 houses to take care of for 4 years.2.  I need much less stuff than I thought I needed to make me happy.  I have about 2 feet of hanging clothes this whole time and 2 jackets.  About 6 pair of shoes.  1 pot, 1 pan.  Full size fridge.  This has worked fine, esp for mostly summer weather.  3.  Less space means less choices, forcing me to be creative about privacy and relaxation.  I have been exercising most of my life, lately, it truly is an escape for me.  From the tiny room.  When I need a break from my spouse, I either go somewhere alone and exercise or grocery shop. Spend time with friends and family more.  I have even become very adaptive, in that I put headphones in and listen to an audio book or relaxation music  with my eye pillow blocking out light.  I turn away from said spouse if I am in a huff.  This helps me too when it is noisy and I have trouble getting back to sleep in the middle of the night.4.  Less space is easier to keep clean and frees me up to do other things. No further explaining needed here!5.  It takes me at least 3 months to adjust to my surroundings.  Now that many of the things that were driving me nuts before, I am getting used to.  However, new pet peeves abound.  Still cannot wait to get out of here.  But, I am proud of my ability to adapt.6.  I have more confidence in my ability to deal with an environment I do not like.  I have joked that if DH and I can get through this, we can get through anything.  I really was joking.  However, the adjustment to retirement - at least the big immediate leap, seems like a dream now.  We will obviously have much adjusting to do, long term.  But, we are going to be elated for a couple of months, I think!7.  I have less affection for fellow man and simultaneously look forward to having more solitude.  This is huge.  I have never really been introverted, but I am now!8.  I have gratitude for the comfort of my retirement home.  I loved our RH the minute we walked in.  Now, it will seem like pure heaven.  I will do a post soon about the things I will never miss about the extended stay!  Haha.  9.  I am forced to plan more and be more creative for meals.  I do not need nearly so much groceries or kitchen equipment. I took a bunch of photos.  I will have to organize and post these!  When faced with the prospect of 4 small cabinets above and 2 large ones below, along with the task of carrying all the bags from car to elevator - while using a card key for 2 doors...you buy way less!10.  It is easier to get ready since I have much less clothes, shoes and jewelry. I have been mostly just taking home dirty clothes to wash and not bringing much back.  It will not be to difficult to fit what is left in my much smaller closet in retirement home.  But, I still have too much and not enough order there.  So, this has been helpful.  I will truly only keep what is comfortable and functional and makes me feel good about wearing it.  I also plan to shift to mindset that everything I have is every day wear (except for some dressy stuff for special occasions, weddings, funerals, church - if I need to work, etc).  I will never truly be a capsule wardrobe kind of gal - but I have REALLY cut down.  That is a work in progress.  The biggest change of all - I don't care about clothes shopping at all.  I will have to watch my online shopping.  Welcome to the 21st Century, huh?  Don't a lot of us!2 more nights.  Have a great hump day!"},
{"title": "Retirement and Money", "date": "Tuesday, September 25, 2018", "text": "Talking about retirement is incomplete without talk about money.  It is a weird topic for me.  It certainly comes from my upbringing.  I guess most of us do carry some emotion around this topic.  I have listened to Dave Ramsey and Suzi Orman - they are just dynamic and accessible.  Less accessible is honest, not perfect, real everyday people and their stories.  At least specifics.  Most people will talk in generalities.  Actually, some of the more specific numbers I get are other bloggers.  Whether they are accurate is no way to tell.I looked at some statistics...According to the Motley Fool, 40% of Americans do not have enough money to cover a $400 emergency.  This same article says that the ave American hh savings is $16, 420 while the median is $4380.  That means most Americans have closer to the $4380 figure.  In another article, this same source indicated that ave retirement costs a bit over $700,000.  It also indicates that 1/3 of American hh do not have ANY money saved for retirement.This tells me that we are a bit above average.  We have more saved up and less debt and also DH has a small pension which is a trend of a bygone era.  For us, our goals were simple.  Pay off our house and credit cards.  See if we could anticipate our budget needs, both bare bones and with a little flesh for wiggle room.  6 months emergency fund.  2 months immediate emergency fund for Oct and Nov - before pension and SS start.  I have our taxes saved up for house/personal property that is due in Oct.  I also have a year of homeowners insurance ready to renew that policy in mid October.  We have gotten everything in the house the way we want it (kitchen flooring and lighting).  No other home improvements for a while.  I have cash to buy a TV for my kitchen and I have paid off our NYC trip.  What else?  Another way that makes us stand out, is that DH is 13 years older than I and I can and will go back to work.  We have decided that just for the time being, we are going to take a break and see how we do on this reduced budget.  I can start looking in 2019 or 2020.  I don't really care what career track I am on, so I will be fine reinventing myself.  We have decided we are going to sell our old suburban and my motorcycle.  If we sell my Harley, we may get a small cheaper bike I can hop on just to go to the next town, or just scoot up the road.  The suburban, we will keep that money and save it to eventually replace DH older car.  We are still paying on my Toyota truck, but that fits in budget fine and we need reliable vehicle to be able to drive back to the city to see my Granny.I am using my last paycheck for spending money in NYC.  I can't think of a more fun way to celebrate that!"},

That’s where God cared for His people so much He provided manna in the morning and quail at night. (Exodus 16:12) But God only provided food six days of the week. Moses said, “Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none” (Exodus 16:26, ESV). And, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD … ’” (Exodus 16:23a).Yesterday was a day of blissful rest.  We went to a friends to watch football.   We took a pizza.  My friend sent us home with enough pulled pork for 3 sandwiches!Even last night I slept great.   But I sure am grouchy today.  Still fighting this site throat going on 3 weeks now.But my thoughts this morning are on two things.  How God has always provided for me and how quickly time marches on, making me want to relish in gratitude this morning.  Even as we are counting down the days, we are still aware just how much grace in our lives we have received.  So, even when I am grouchy.  I have to laugh because I know I need to reign in my inner 5 year old, when things don't go my way.  After all, I did not get bronchitis or even a sinus infection.  When I read this post I paste above, I had to knock on wood mentally, because while I assume we will have good health the next 3 months (with more rest, relaxation, less stress, less eating out) I certainly could be wrong.  So it is with God's will, we have good health.  And my wish is for any of you who read this to also have good health.We drove by our old neighborhood yesterday, our favorite neighbors had some mail for us that had not been forwarded.  We got to catch up with them real quick.  We just love these people to bits.  Then we lounged at home and talked about our plans this week.  We decided after dinner wed night we will do the bulk of our room pack up.  Which leaves me time to sleep in Friday, since Thursday is my last day at work.  What are your plans for this week?"},

{"title": "Concert", "date": "Wednesday, September 19, 2018", "text": "We had such a fun date night last night.  My husband and I stayed as late as possible with the dogs and walked them all twice, since we would have to delay their usual 9pm walking.  We were not hungry, so we did not bother to eat out before, we decided to just grab something there.  DH and I have had no appetites since we have had this sinus/sore throat stuff.  DH had sprung for amazing seats.  He likes us to sit up close and on the end.  We got there way early and had a bite.  It was 95+, but we were at least in the shade.  Judas Priest was first.  They have 2 original members, Rob Halford vocals and Ian Hill, bass.  Drummer Scott Travis joined later, but still been with them since 1989.  I read in Wikipedia that Scott Travis was responsible for hiring Halford's replacement, Tim \"Ripper\" Owens in 1996.  This is what the movie Rock Star is loosely based on.  If you haven't seen it, it is really good.  Starring Mark Wahlberg and Ripper.  His girlfriend is Jennifer Anniston in the film.  There is even a cameo of one of my very favorite singers, Myles Kennedy.  Anyway, I ramble.Rob Halford reunited with JP in 2003.  DH and I flew to see them in Dallas in 2010.  I am fortunate to see them then, with all original members includine K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton.  Downing left in 2011 and evidently, Tipton recently had to stop touring, because he has Parkinsons.  The sources I looked at did not have the replacement guitar name updated.  JP is known for their dualing guitars, which is somewhat unique.  DH has loved them since the start (1969).  DH says JP got him through the disco years.  along with Ozzy.  Sort of like how Metallica and Rob Zombie got me through the grunge years.Anyway, DH and I knew right away we had similar musical tastes, which we both fancied because we love rock and roll and esp metal.  We enjoy concerts and plan to continue as long as we are able and can afford a splurge.  On the way home, we talked about some of the acts we would still pay to see...we agree on our bucket list is still Robin Trower - neither one of us has seen him yet.  Much of my music taste has been shaped by DH and before him, friends I have had.  Also my late husband SCG.  SCG loved Robin Trower and Deep Purple and introduced me to them both (along with Ozzy, Queensryche and Joe Walsh).  I have seen Ozzy 6 times, Queensryche twice and Joe Walsh once.  I could do a weeks worth of posts on concerts.So I was nostalgic and honored to finally see Deep Purple.So excited I got to see the Ian's - Ian Gillan and Ian Paice.  Ian Paice is one of my favorite drummers ever.  Just listen to \"Burn\" sometime and consider the stamina.  He still has it.  He is 70 years old, BTW.  Ian Gillan cannot quite hit the high notes, like he used to, but God love him - that guy is 73!Very impressed with the great talent of new keyboard player, Don Airey.  Per Wikipedia:  Donald Smith Airey (born 21 June 1948) has been the keyboardist in the rock band Deep Purple since 2002, after the retirement of Jon Lord. He has had a long and productive career, playing with such acts as Gary Moore, Ozzy Osbourne, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Jethro Tull, Whitesnake, Saxon, Wishbone Ash, Steve Vai, Colosseum II, Ten, Sinner, Michael Schenker, Rainbow, Empire, Thin Lizzy, Brian May, Divlje jagode and Living Loud. He has also worked with Andrew Lloyd Webber. He was amazing.  DH and I agree we need keyboards to come back in rock and roll.Also a great artist is Steve Morse.  Steve Morse (born July 28, 1954) is an American guitarist and composer, best known as the founder of the Dixie Dregs; and since 1994, the guitar player of Deep Purple. Morse's career has encompassed rock, country, funk, jazz, classical, and fusion of these musical genres. In addition to his successful solo career, he was briefly a member of Kansas in the mid-1980s. Most recently, Morse became a member of the supergroup Flying Colors alongside long-time bandmate Dave LaRue.  He was great too!  It was hot!  But a wonderful show in our favorite venue in the entire city.  I was an hour late getting into work today.  Oops.  First time this year.  I am never late to work."},

{"title": "16 Days", "date": "Tuesday, September 11, 2018", "text": "This is a picture my girlfriend took of me driving us back to the city Sunday.  Yes, I am one of those people.  At least when DH is not in the car with me and can take our little female on his lap.  Fall is in the air here in the Midwest.  And we have 16 more days.  I was thinking about the changing of the seasons and realize as we are going into fall this year, we are sort of going into the \"fall\" of our lives.  I lived in Arizona for a couple years.  I missed the seasons there.  It was relentlessly hot.  Danerously hot.  Unforgivingly hot.  The scenery is mostly brown.  Lots of rocks and small shrubs dot the desert as you drive into town.  It was 1999 and I drove into town with my dog and cat.  My significant other drove me out from Little Rock and stayed.  I had transferred with my job, so the movers would deliver my stuff.  I just had to unpack.  My convertible was brought out on a car carrier.  I rented a duplex.  It was weird having rocks for a yard.  I had grass in the back with olive and eucalyptus trees.  It smelled different.  There were also these large brown birds that sang weird songs that was really different from anything I experienced in the Midwest.  I had a stressful job.  On weekends I liked to explore the area for relaxation.  Once I hiked with my boyfriend at South Mountain park.  We both took water and had sunscreen, hats, etc.  But how naïve we were.  We also had my dog with us.  My beautiful Golden Retriever.  My second Golden.   We started out in the morning.  They trail we chose was downhill and back up.  I started to dread the hike back up.  Boyfriend decided he would give me the last of the water and I would go back to car with the dog and pick him up at bottom.  Thinking back I am not sure why we split up that day.  It does not sound like my idea.  He was a little impulsive and immature - that was the reason we broke up not long after.  I don't blame him for this day, I was stupid and unprepared too.Anyway, I start back to the car.  It was just over the rise, I thought.  Water was running low, it was getting hotter.  My dog crept along and kept sticking his head in the shadows of the large boulders and small bushes that make up South Mountain landscape.  I thought to myself how awful I felt putting my dog through this.I kept walking.  I started to wonder if I was lost.  The scenery all looked the same.  I kept topping each hill and more hills stretched out before me.  My had started feeling too small and I was feeling the sun burning my shoulders.  My sunglasses were sweaty and I had to keep pushing them up.  My mind started racing.Pretty soon I started to feel panic creep in.  I wondered if I could carry my dog the rest of the way.  He was panting and seemed very focused on any shade he could put his head in.  I alternated thinking how stupid I was and how scared I was.  I could not believe what was happening.  I had never been lost before.  I grew up in the woods in the Midwest, where trees are tall and there are landmarks.About the time I was wondering what to do and was on the verge of complete hopelessness, I topped a rise and spotted the parking lot and my car!  I never felt so much relief.  There was a while cinderblock building that contained bathrooms.  I ran in but there was no water coming out of the faucets.I got in the car and blasted the ac to cool my dog down.  I retraced the drive we had taken into the park.  I saw boyfriend and picked him up.  He too had been hot and worried at the end.  He was quick to laugh and dismiss.  I will never forget that day.  It was in late May, which is late to hike in Phoenix.  I also heard many times in the years I lived there that many people from back east/Midwest who are not accustomed to the heat/landscape die making mistakes like we made.  I am so grateful that was not my fate that day.Colossians 3:1313  Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. Sure is easier to figure out someone elses issues - like deciding they need to forgive.  Hahaha.  But harder when I look at my own quandary.  But forgiving is actually better for ourselves too.  Not to is like drinking poison and expecting someone else to get sick.  I see a lot of people around who need to forgive, so I am going to work on that myself.  Couple of people have disappointed me lately but I cannot control people, places, situations.  Another person who (actually 2) who have voiced such feelings to me I wanted to say \"it is not always about you\".  So, maybe that is where I can start!  The other thing I pointed out is look at the positives.  One person is grieving a breakdown about family - this person going through a really hard time right now.  But she had 4 people who dropped everything to be there for her and she was focused on the ones that were missing.  Great workout last night and coffee with friends.  To bed early, allergies affecting me - sore throat.  Slept great - thank goodness the stompers were quiet last night as were the people directly across the hall.  DH had dental procedure yesterday, so he needed the rest also.I really do need to do a little drifting.  Just enough to put on my own oxygen mask.  Just in time for a few friends I have in my life who I still love, but I just find lacking.  I will drift quietly, not burn the bridge in huge dramatic fashion as of bygone life.  Maybe it has nothing to do with me, or everything.  I don't need to figure it out."},

{"title": "Mom's Pillow", "date": "Friday, September 7, 2018", "text": "My mom cross stitched a pillow that says \"When things look down, look up\".  I treasure it.  It reminds me of the simple homespun advice she used to give me.  Happiness is a state of mind.  Then I grew wiser and more worldly and decided her advise was oversimplified.  And I had more education and more experience that my mom.  My inner message of victimhood versus state of mind was easier than self accountability and bolstered by headlines and advertisements.  Headlines about people doing stupid things and suing people and advertisements about medicine you could take to make you happy.  You don't have to do the hard work - blame someone else...take a pill!And then I turned another corner.  I started really looking at my place in how my life is experienced and realized much of how I feel really is up to me.  I am not saying that medication is unnec or a sign of weakness.  But I would rather try medicine as a holistic approach.  Try other things too, like exercise, eating right, rest and cleaning my side of the street.  Sometimes life is not just about who is at fault.  As life hands us challenges, we learn we don't have to face it alone.  From my daily Proverbs 31 ministries devotion. How often do we turn our gaze inward and overlook the beauty our heavenly Father has prepared for us? How often do we concentrate on the things of this world instead of turning our eyes to what’s truly important?  If you’re like me, when it seems like joy has left the building, I need to remind myself often of what’s true: “This is the day the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it” (Psalm 118:24).     -KariAnn WoodBurt Reynolds died at 82 yesterday.  He seemed like a fun loving, superficial guy who had everything handed to him.  But he wanted to be a foot ball player and was injured.  He had a slow start in acting.  He overcame his own obstacles, like we all have.  He used humor as a way to interact with the world.  Which I relate to.  I admired his roles in his light, funny movies.  And sort of feel like he reminded me a little of my dad.  My dad was a handsome, mustachioed guy's guy who also went through life thinking he had the world by string and had people admire him for the twinkle in his eye.  I can see why my mom loved my dad so much and stuck with him.Patton Oswald, the comedian tweeted yesterday \"Burt Reynolds & Clint Eastwood were fired from Gunsmoke & Rawhide at the same time.  Burt was told he couldn't act and Clint was told his neck was too skinny.  In the parking lot, Burt said to Clint.  'I dunno know what you're gonna do, but I'm gonna take acting lessons' \".  God moves mountains, but you better bring a shovel.  Do the hard work, but do it with style and humor.  BR said \"All you really have in the end are your stories\".  I am going to make some fun stories this weekend.  I hope you do too!  I still want a 1977 Trans Am."},

{"title": "Another Story from the Vault", "date": "Friday, August 31, 2018", "text": "This story is similar to my story yesterday, in that it involved an interaction on the highway with a complete stranger.  The differences might be very different, or they might not be that different.  It is weird...So a few years later, things are very different for my life.  I lived in a different state and I was a bit older, maybe a year, maybe 2 years.  But I was driving from my state (I lived in a dry county) to the neighboring state to buy alcohol.  I was driving my black Camaro.  It was warm, but not hot and it was the weekend, probably Saturday and probably morning-ish.  I had driven to Missouri to buy alcohol for a quiet evening with some friends.  I was now a widow, but seeing someone else.  I was young still, 28 or so.  After my late husband, SCG, passed away I wasted no time.  I wanted to quiet the quiet, sad loneliness.  So, I started dating within a year (big mistake) with someone I knew from a prior life (bigger mistake?).  I only explain this, because it makes a little sense understanding my thought process - well, I KNEW him.Anyway, I was driving by myself.  I know this time I had the windows open because my car was black, it was sunny and even in the spring this car was hot!  Because I had no air conditioning in it and because when you drove anywhere, it would heat up and make the entire car hot!  Haha, the fun things we do when we are young.  But it was a Camaro!  Score!  Goodbye new import 4 cylinder with working AC and sunroof and automatic transmission.OK, back to my story...so I had been to the store about 15-20 min from my house and was on my way back.  Well, I notice a motorcycle.  I don't know how...like if I came up behind him, or vice versa.  The motorcycle and I each see one another because one passes the other (I don't remember as clearly as the Alabama car/car story).  A LOT had happened in that year/year and a half.  So, the motorcycle rider is a male.  I don't remember if he wore a helmet, etc.  I also had a motorcycle then, but I was just learning and I had never ridden it on the highway.  So, I noticed motorcycles...and cars.  I was raised a tom-boy - more on that some day.Anyway, the motorcycle rider is in front of me in the same lane.  We are on a 2 lane road, the main highway south from Missouri into Arkansas (540?).  He slows down, way down.  I move to the left lane and go around without fanfare.  He passed me again.  He gets over into the right lane in front of me again.  He slows down again.  This goes on.  It turned from being amusing.  To being weird.  I was not in fear, but I was confused and not sure what do to.  He goes by one last time and I will never forget this - he hits the hood of my car with his hand!  Not hard, just smacks it.  While he is smiling and looking at me.  Well, that was really too much for me.  I just wanted to get home now.So, I recalled the guy in the car in Alabama...and decided just what to do...At the next exit, which would have been an exit to Rogers.  I let the guy get in front of me and I watch the timing with the exit...I pause...I slow...and just as he gets to the point where he could not take the exit, I go right quickly!  And I get the end of the off ramp, looking to see if I can see him up ahead and do not, and I turn left.  Just for good measure, I take a circuitous route home.  I was not threatened or shook up.  Just weirded out.  And this was easily 25 years ago.  Today I would probably freak out.  I also just gave up my age.  Oh well.  I like the saying about having a past that is not so boring that you have some stories in your old age.  And I am quickly on my way to old age!"},
{"title": "Stories from the Vault", "date": "Thursday, August 30, 2018", "text": "I was driving from Huntsville, Alabama to the gulf once upon a time back in the 90's.  I lived in Alabama.  It was a warm June day, early on a Friday morning.  I had taken the day off to have a long weekend.  I was meeting a couple other gals for a weekend at the beach.  I was a recent widow.  I had not taken off my wedding ring yet.  I was not ready.  The women I were meeting were also widows, not much older than myself.  They both worked for the same company that I did.  One woman was about 15 years my senior.  Her husband had been a doctor.  He performed some procedures that were controversial, still are.  He was murdered by a protestor.  This was several years prior.  The other woman was just a few years older than myself.  Her husband had taken his own life, this was a couple years prior.  I was 26 years old.  They had suggested I come down and go to the beach with them for a long weekend.  I suspect now that my boss, BMc, at the time had encouraged this.  More about him another time.  He was a special guy, a great boss, a mentor I will never forget.  The sun was up in the sky, high enough to start getting warm.  I still had my windows and my sunroof open, delaying closing them and turning on the AC until I just could not stand the humidity.  I had packed a hat to keep the sun off my face while I was at the beach.  I had it on in the car so that my long hair was not blowing so much it would get tangled.  I had my favorite pair of Ray Bans on.  My late husband, SCG, had introduced me to them.  He loved his Wayfarers.  I would have never considered spending so much money on a pair of sunglasses, but he wanted to treat me.  I loved how sturdy and solid they felt.  The polarized lenses brightened up the sky surrounding the sun in a way I have never seen with my cheaper versions.  I shared the road with a large black car, but did not notice much other traffic.  I think it was mid morning on a Friday, so few other cars.  I first noticed the car come up behind me in my lane, also going south on I-65.  I was in the right lane.  The car came up behind me and followed me for a while.  After a few minutes, the car pulled over into the left lane and slowly made it's way up next to my car.  I noticed in my side mirror, the sun reflect off the shiny car.  Seeing the luxury model, I glanced over to admire it.  I love cars.  My eyes met the eyes of the other driver.  We looked at each other for a second.  I realized it was a fairly handsome man dressed in a suit.  We held eye contact for a second.  He went on around me and I admired the beautiful black Cadillac.  I enjoyed hearing the throaty V8 exhaust sound as it passed.  I usually drive about 5 over the speed limit.  I used to drive faster.  I used to have one, maybe two radar detectors.  My radar detectors were silent.  I noticed the man in the Cadillac also had a radar detector.  Maybe he drove a lot too.I had gotten one free and bought the other, expensive gadget a couple years earlier.  My mother was ill and dying 600+ miles away in another state and I drove home once a month to see her.  I did not speed carelessly, but I did push it just a little late on Friday's on the barren wide open interstate when I would leave work early to get back to my hometown by midnight to spend as much time as I could with my mother.  So, my late husband and I decided to get the $300 radar detector to save me delay and tickets.The black Cadillac moved over into the right lane up ahead of me.  The car's speed adjusted to just about what my speed was.  I stayed behind and followed along, enjoying the sunshine, the wind and my radio.  I was looking forward to seeing the ocean.  I kept correcting myself with a chuckle - my late husband always corrected me - the Gulf, he would say.  To me, it was as breath taking as any ocean view.  So I always called it the ocean.The first time I ever saw a beach.  Years earlier, he took me for my first trip to Florida.  I was 22.  I will never forget the feeling of awe I had toward it.  And toward him.  I loved the sound of the waves crashing on the beach, the sunrise and sunsets, the palm trees, the salt spray, the beautiful white sand beaches of the Gulf coast.This visit was my first time back to the beach since he had died.  I had some mixed feelings, but I was trying to focus on the good feelings.  The happy memories.  I was trying hard not to think about the shock of his death, or the painful journey we had as he discovered his illness, received his diagnosis, began his treatment.  There were many beautiful things for me to consider.  How he worried about me while he lay in his hospital bed.  How he sent me flowers for Valentines Day while he was still in the hospital.  He had arranged it weeks before he went to the hospital and had even furnished a hand written card to the florist shop...all in preparation of him being in the hospital for months for a transplant.  How he insisted he come home for my birthday, even though the doctors told him it was too soon.  How he fell while he was home during my birthday and had to go back to the hospital.  How I was torn between trying to work full time, and drive 90 miles one way twice a week to be with him, all while caring for our Golden Retriever, Sunny.  How S had bought Sunny as a puppy for me on the first Mother's Day after my mother had died.  This was my reverie now.  Maybe I was a little distracted, maybe I was feeling wistful at how happy I still could feel about the beach now.  About anything.  I still kept my attention on the road and on the car in front of me.  I soon realized we were almost to Birmingham.  I was stopping in Birmingham to have my car serviced.  I was concerned about one of my gauges.  So, I decided when I left Huntsville I better have it checked out before the rest of my drive to Florida.  I cannot recall who turned on their blinker first, him or me.  But we both exited the first main exit to Birmingham.  I pulled up to the stop sign to turn left, back under the interstate to the Acura dealer I could see from the highway.  The man in the Cadillac was in the lane to turn right.  He rolled his driver side window down and gestured to me.  I rolled my passenger side window down.  He smiled, a good looking man.  He was older than me.  I smiled a small smile back, I did not want to be rude, but I did not want to flirt either.  He laughed and said he noticed me a ways back on the highway and knew it was crazy, but would I want to have lunch with him.  I laughed back and said as tempting as it was, I could not do that.  I held up my hand and showed him my wedding ring and laughed saying \"I am married, but thank you\".  He smiled and waived, pulling out to go West and I pulled out and drove East."},
{"title": "Stories from the Vault - Postponed", "date": "Wednesday, August 29, 2018", "text": "I referenced a couple of stories about my experience with strangers while driving - 2 of them I can think of off the top of my head.  I will write about them tomorrow.Today, I want to write about 2 families on my mind...I posted a LONG post.  Then came back and curated considerably.  Relative with stage 4 cancer diagnosis.  She is doing amazing.  Mass in her lung is gone, as are the other tumors in liver, lymph nodes and couple other places.  It is a miracle!  She can barely breathe, so tenuous her understanding and comprehension.  She says she will celebrate at her 1 year mark...So amazing.  On the other hand...her son is in his 20's.  Did not know his father.  He is very smart, but just no \"gumption\".Relative had some issues in her life, she will be the first to admit.  But she always worked hard.  She had a great father.  At one point she was very successful in her career, making over 6 figures.  But after some relationship issues, a big geographic move and some job insecurity...ended up essentially scraping by job to job, no savings left, and barely kept her house, which is pretty run down and too big for her to properly care for.  Well, when she got ill.  Her family has tried to be supportive.  We all tried to be there for her and J her son.  We all tried to gently comfort J while simultaneously encouraging him to \"man up\", the brothers tried to mentor him.  The problem is...we are all located distantly, busy working/caring for our families and have not been around him enough to naturally foster such personal relationships.  It is hard to \"start\" now from many miles away.  Any ideas?At one point, she even encouraged us via group text to not let him feel abandonded, should she die.  I have tried a couple of times, not really knowing what to do and not getting any response in return.  What can I do now?  I admit, I feel distant partly because I just don't respect his bad choices.  But I do sincerely pray for and want the best for them both.Well, evidently now the son and his mother had a falling out.  She explained that after he left in a hurry, she inspected his room and found it covered in trash.  Items she found troubling.  She even texted me pictures - it was shocking to me.  Mom wants to sell this house that is too big and get moved into a smaller place but she worries about J.  J meanwhile is just piling trash in his room and not helping enough.  I told her (gently and with great emphasis on the disclaimer) - I HAVE NO CHILDREN - that she needs to cut the cord for his own good too.  So, clearly this guy has issues...it is really sad.  Another sort of related topic...I have a family member whose husband was in a bad car accident recently.  Likely his fault,  their only car.  He is similar in affect to J, smart and wants to tell you how smart he is, sort of anti society.  Well he was hurt badly.  I think the passenger and the other driver are OK.  Many issues about accident I wont go into...What if S and JD have no money saved up for emergencies?  Oh, these poor choices.  These 2 examples are not isolated...it is sad and scary.  Lord if someone is hurting today, please visit them and embrace and comfort them.  Amen.Did I mention that neither J or JD have any spirituality - no experience in nature, no meditation/solitude, no exercise, no artistic outlet.  No humility, I guess.  I think my gumption came from humility, which unfortunately came from humiliation - my father's way of cultivating obedience.  But does it have to come from there?  Do we have to feel small before we can see the big picture?"},
{"title": "Caution", "date": "Tuesday, August 28, 2018", "text": "I saw a social media post about a jogger who was followed by a man in a car.  I have seen quite a few of these lately, usually in rural Midwest, small county roads - women in cars followed by men in cars.  Supposedly single females being followed by single men in cars with no licence plates.  The men in cars engaging in strange behavior, such as photographing the women, passing them, then slowing down to be passed, then repeating.  This happened to me couple times when I was a young woman.  Maybe I will write about them tomorrow.I have seen posts in the past about walkers and joggers being followed, over the past few years.  I wish I could point to some national story that might have been the inspiration...There have been some national news stories about this.  A woman in California taken and then later she escaped.  Several stories about joggers back East.  Then this post I saw last night.  This post was in my old neighborhood of our city house.  This is the 2nd such incident in 2 months in this same 2 block area.  There was a local news story last night about this woman who did the social media post.  She reports that a man in an SUV was parked and when she jogged by, he drove down and cut through at a turn and came up the side she was jogging on.  By then, she joined another jogger and the SUV then left.  I walk there still while we are in extended stay hotel.  The hotel is on an outer road with no shoulder, so I felt it was too dangerous to walk near the hotel.  So, I have been driving over to my old neighborhood and walking.  Now I am not so sure.  I told DH the other day that I often see cars go by and then go by again, I thought not much about it.  Now I have doubts.  DH says he will walk with me after retirement.  I guess I better have him join me now.  But I cannot find anyone who wants to walk as much or as far as I do.  And I will walk in hot or cold.  Makes me sad.  I really need my walks.  Walking helps me get vitamin D, helps me stay trim and lets me eat what I want, helps me clear my mind, creates neurotransmitters, gives me solitude.  If I keep walking, I will stop listening to my books, which is a big part of what I enjoyed.  Guess I can't have it all.  When I walked last night, I also saw a vehicle stopped by a road that did not continue (like where you see the signs with red diamonds).  The vehicle was running and there was a man sitting in it.  DH said maybe the man was watching his wife jog - I did see several other women jogging.  If DH won't/can't keep up with me - I guess I will just have to have him go with me and at least sit in his car and watch me.  Crazy isn't it?!I guess I may try to go to yoga tonight.  It is worth the $15 per time.  If I cannot walk outside, I just don't know what I would do.  I guess in my little small town usa retirement town, I will walk laps around town instead of walking out in the middle of nowhere.  But part of the appeal of where I walked here in the suburbs was seeing nature, birds, critters...etc.  I wonder if this is some sort of worry phenomenon or if there really is more young women being followed.  This hysteria on the heels of the girl missing and then found dead in Iowa?  What do you guys think?  I do not walk without protection, I will just leave that at that.  But I am still just a middle aged woman, no match for a strong man or men.  It really makes me wonder."},

{"title": "Grain Moon", "date": "Sunday, August 26, 2018", "text": "The Old Farmers Almanac gives the Native American names for each month's full moon.  The Native Americans named them to track the seasons.  Tonight is Grain Moon.  The corn here in the midwest is tall and close to harvest, but not quite ready.   It is still green, so it is also known as The Green Corn Moon. We spent some time admiring the corn as we drove home to the city to get in another week of work.   We also have enjoyed seeing the moon this weekend.  I came home and went to the store,  grateful my food gathering is as easy as driving to a store.  I can imagine for the Native Americans, it was time to gather as much as they could to both process and preserve it, along with the wild game they hunted to get ready for the fall and winter.   I walked after I fixed dinner and fixed lunches for Monday and Tues.   I cut it close, sunset is now 8pm.  Days start to get noticeably shorter now.  DH and I both had headaches this weekend,  fatigue and aches and pains...sort of grouchy we both were.  My back is also giving me fits making me think I need to tighten up my diet and get back to yoga soon.  Native Americans and early settlers did a lot of physical labor and moving around.  Today, our culture benefits from so much convenience, they we have come too far the other way.  DH and I sit long hours at computers at our jobs.  We need to keep moving.  My 5 mile walk felt wonderful. Going to bed, so my body can rest up.  Happy Grain moon to you."},

{"title": "Update on the Extended Stay Saga", "date": "Tuesday, August 21, 2018", "text": "Rained almost 2 inches Sunday afternoon into night and was still rainy Monday morning.  I have learned to walk the dog before I do hair and make up, then come in and finish getting ready for work.  DH walks the boy dog separately.  He is getting old and slow and does not want to walk as much as the girl.  So, I walk the girl and then get ready for work.Work was uneventful.  They hired 2 more temps to work on my project, but no one mentioned to me (I work on a separate floor and its not like I see anyone on my team).  My work is still steady, but we are winding down I thought.  I just have no idea of the magnitude or implications.  I just hope I don't have to train them.  I feel like I don't know enough.  I just do few very specific parts of the project. After work, it was still rainy, so I knew I would not walk.  And I was hungry and restless.  So we went out to eat with our friends B & B.  We go to this Asian buffet place.  We used to really like it, they have suchi rolls and hibachi, typical Chinese, shrimp, prime rib, etc.  But when I was having lots of issues with my tummy, I would eat various combinations to see if it helped...just sushi, just salad bar, just hibachi, just meat and veggies...even just fruit one time.  Well, we have pretty much decided this place must just bathe the food in MSG.  After we eat there, we feel bloated and sluggish and last night I drank 3 large glasses of water and woke up every 2 hours or so.  It is crazy.Back to the hotel saga...evidently the police did arrest a man in the hotel we are staying in...it was in the 5 and 6 oclock news stories.  He had a wife and kids and checked in Sunday and when the police knocked on the door, he jumped out the 3rd floor window onto the awning below where he was shot with a police bean bag and fell on down to the ground where he was apprehended.  Crazy.  Oh, and this morning the elevator is broken and as I was leaving at 6:30 a man and a woman were yelling at each other because the elevator was broken and so we all have to use the side doors which require a key and sometimes don't work with a key...we gotta get out of this place!"},

{"title": "I Try Not to Watch the News", "date": "Wednesday, August 8, 2018", "text": "I am not in Chicago, but another similar Midwestern city.  And, like Chicago we have had a recent spate of shootings.  I absolutely WILL NOT talk politics on this blog or any of my social media.  In fact, i really don't like to discuss it at all - it seems like the current 2 party system we have in America is dividing us more than ever.  Yesterday was voting day.  Yet, after work I walked 5 miles and then went home and fixed us smoothies, showered and fell asleep without watching the results.  It is a scary time in our nation and in the world.  When I watch or listen to too much news, I get really negative and consumed with worry.  Worry is something I have plenty of naturally.  So I instead focus on the positive (the helpers, as Mr. Rogers said) and I try to pay attention just enough to know the issues and be informed.  I feel sadness for the old people, the people who fought for what freedoms we cherish and I feel bad for the young people and the disadvantaged.  The helpless animals.  And then I remind myself that God is in charge.As with things that happen in one's individual life...I do believe the things that are happening all around us are happening for a reason.  So, I try to focus on the similarities.  I feel better when I smile at a stranger who seemed rude, maybe they are having a really challenging issue in their life.  The person who cut me off, maybe they are dealing with something bad.  The person who disappointed me - maybe it had nothing to do with me at all.  I am not a big believer in astrology or stuff like that, but I did find this interesting.  Friday the 27th was a blood moon and supposedly the last week or so we were supposed to be able to see Mars clearly (we can't here in the city - the sky is too bright from lights).  DH is way more pragmatic than I in such matter (no way he would even give it a 2nd thought).  However, DH was a cop many years ago and he swore (as do first responders, ER doctors/nurses and teachers) that when there was a full moon - they know by peoples' collective behavior.  So, what does that mean?  I don't know.  The moon does control the tide, after all.  Anyway, here is a little snippet I read about Mars retrograde:...\"Pisces and Pisces Ascendant: All Mars retrograde cycles affect you in the areas of personal finances, income, possessions, comfort, and values. These areas might be ambiguous now, or cause for concern and anxiety for the time being. Reassessing these matters becomes necessary. This is a good time for taking a hard look at your budget. It’s also a time for understanding how the management of your personal resources impacts your confidence in general.\"  -credit to Astrology CaféThis is funny to me because we are 1)  living in an extended stay hotel and 2)  we have 2 meetings with 2 different financial advisors.  Do I ascribe some power to this?  No, not actively.  Maybe passive interest.  Anyway, have a Wonderful Wednesday everyone!"},
{"title": "Allergies", "date": "Tuesday, August 7, 2018", "text": "Even though we are getting a nice soaking rain after a thunderstorm last night, my allergies are really bad.  I started feeling the dry eye, sinus headaches mid week last week.  Sunday, Monday and today I can add in stomach issues.  I looked up the chart on the internet for allergens and no wonder!On top of allergy season (spring and especially fall, for me) I was anxious to hear some bad news and struggling family members, then the trip to the lake and back home so late (I barely ate anything that sets me off)...even though I slept late Sunday, it is all catching up with me.  Monday I felt horrible.  I went home after work and went to bed.  DH ordered Chinese food and I sipped some soup.  I got a good rest, no walk last night.  I am going to eat very light today, see of I can be gentle with my system.  I know we need the rain and maybe that will help.  Then allergies back to high tomorrow as we go into ragweed season, which is bad for me.  I know it is just temporary.  At least I will lose some weight, so there is that!  When allergens are high, my autoimmune goes into high gear.  I have tried allergy medicine, but not much helps my tummy with the allergen irritation.  About the only thing I can do is eat well, rest and moderate exercise.  It will last about 2 weeks.  I don't really have the weight to lose this summer, so I am praying it is not too bad this season.  Do any of you have late summer/fall allergies?  Spring?  Any of you notice a coinciding gastrointestinal dysfunction?  Any remedies you can think of.  I try to do lots of whole foods, soups, broths and smoothies.  Maybe I will crockpot a chicken over the weekend at Retirement Home and get some good old fashioned bone broth, rich in collagen and sip on it all next week.  Sitting here thinking about trying some Kombucha.Have a great Tuesday!"},
{"title": "Back from a Quick Lake Trip", "date": "Monday, August 6, 2018", "text": "If you want only one thing too much, it’s likely to turn out a disappointment.  The only healthy way to live, as I see it, is to learn to like all the little everyday things.”~Lonesome DoveWe drove down to the lake for the day Saturday.  We considered spending the night, but my friends had a houseful and our dogs were pretty stressed out.  Also, I was wide awake because I tried some of the Mio Energy - whew!  That stuff is crazy.  I don't do a lot of caffeine.  I was wide awake at 11:30.  Our dogs did better than we thought around the 2 big dogs that were there, but I just worried about them barking during the night.  But we were really glad we went and got to spend time with our friends.  I have known the 2 guys since I was in grade school and one of their wives since high school and I just really cherish such friendships.  And I am really happy to see Allen enjoy them and hang out with the guys.  DH does not have a big circle of friends.  In fact, he only has his family and 1 friend from grade school that died few years ago.  I respect that he is more reserved, but it is different for me.  I used to confuse quantity with quality.I used to think it was just a disadvantage to have few friends.  But people can really disappoint sometimes and DH does not let very many close enough to disappoint him.  He is coming around and I am becoming less extroverted.  We are finding a happy medium, I think.  I am becoming more choosy about what influence and personalities and values I want around me and he is becoming willing to meet people.  I think we become more choosy about friends with age naturally, but I also think I feel much better about solitude than I did when I was younger.  Therefore, if I am going to spend time with others and give up some of my solitude, it will be with people that I really respect and value.  For me, that is a very good thing to weigh my solitude.  We did enjoy some time with just our 3 friends before the neighbors and other company arrived Saturday.  That was nice.  I enjoy our talks.  T is a nurse.  She and I both feel we have the problem solver role in many family and friends interactions.  our spouses are more reserved.  She said she sees the positive in someone until they prove her wrong, while J her husband is the opposite.  I feel the same way.  DH does not accept or trust someone until they earn it.  I accept someone and give them a chance, until they disappoint me.  Then i walk away.  And when I walk away, I don't look back.  While I see the positive approach of T and myself, it can lead to unmet expectations and disappointment.  I also think i have walked away too easily before, or at unrealistic expectations.  However, it is my nature and it is hard to change.  While caregivers can get positive energy from helping others, we can also become very drained from people.  This weekend I was feeling very drained before I went to the lake.  The last few years I have felt very drained.At a time in my life I should feel the opposite, I am feeling heaviness of people around me who are having hard times.  I have had heavy times in my life and have had people prop me up.  So I want to return that valuable gift to others.  But not at the expense of my own sanity.  I have not yet figured out how to reconcile this - so, I will continue to explore this...But some of what I have come to learn is that the help and support I offer others has to come with no strings.  I spend time judging why they are in the situation they are in, what they did, what they could do different, or compare myself to them.  Of course, some people are in situations that are totally out of their control - but I feel this actually pretty rare.  We make a lot of choices.  I need to do less judging and comparing.  If I can give freely of myself with pure motives then I will do that.  I have had people ask me for advise or resources and then not do what they said they would do, not do what I advised or I have given resources to someone who did not use it wisely.  That leads me down a dark path.  I will give unconditionally, or not give and just pray.  Unconditional love is a theme that keeps coming back to me, especially the last couple years.  I think I am starting to look through that lens to understand my past and help me define my boundaries.  If I gave unconditional love, like my creator gave me...and that is all I know to do.  Try to reflect that.I know this is rambling...and I have much more to explore on this...and I will.  Thanks for reading.  I hope someone will chime in.  Have a wonderful Monday."},

I keep thinking that I should be adapting to life in the Extended Stay and be able to sleep, but in practice...not so much.  Was up several times last night, mostly because of the limited space trying to sleep.  I usu sleep really good after sweating so much in hot yoga.  We are used to a  queen.  When we prepaid back in March for our hotel, we asked for a queen or double bed.  They never explained no queen, only double beds - as in full size.  But some rooms have 2 beds, which we would be ok with.  We also asked for 1st floor for ease in walking the dogs and wifi.  We got none of these things!  We are on the 4th floor next to fire escape stairs where doors are always slamming.  We have a single full bed and the wifi is non existent.  After getting moved in, we asked for a week about getting a queen bed moved into our room - no one ever got back to us - it seems no one there knows much of anything, they all refer to the \"manager\".  So, when i finally spoke to the one manager, he said no queens exist.  OK, what about a 2 bed room - well, they are all taken and no way to know when one is available till the people leave.  Then, 2 days ago, they offered us a 2 bed room - but just on the 3rd floor.  DH said he wanted to wait to move all our stuff when a 2 bed room is on 1st or maybe 2nd floor.  Uggggghhhhh.  I will just continue to enjoy the air cranked wayyyyyyy down and very cool room.Supposed to be 98 and 99 through Monday.  Tues high 80s.  We are going to RH this weekend to relax and spread out, do some cleaning and laundry.  We will enjoy taking our smaller car rather than our ginormous older SUV.  We have taken the SUV every trip to RH for the past year and a half.  It costs nearly $100 to fill it up with gas versus $40 for the car.  So, that is nice.  All we have left to move to RH (4hours away) is what we are currently using in hotel.  So, that is a nice thought.Stay cool and enjoy your Wednesday!"},

{"title": "My Brother", "date": "Monday, July 9, 2018", "text": "I realize I missed my brother's  bday. So, I guess my brother must be about 21 or 22 now.  I felt sad, but not regret exactly.  I don't regret being honest with my father and step mom about things I observed which caused me to establish a boundary that essentially omitted them from my life.  So, when my dad passed away in 2014, any chance to get to know my half brother passed with him, I think.  My dad at least tried in the beginning, it bothered him that we did not spend holidays together, at first.  But then we were not included in vacations or family photos either...so I guess my dad either just gave up or got angry with me for my confrontational, blunt way of speaking of it.  I just feel like I need to talk about things...not just stuff them - that makes me sick, physically sick.  But that is the way of my dad and his family of origin - don't talk about it!    I used to be a master manipulator and control freak.  And I used words as a sword and a shield.  I realized that just made me feel bad.  My sould searching and personal experiences have lead me to conclude that manipulation and control is the very last thing I want to do today.  This has caused me to be a little more aloof, but I know that is best for my stability and serenity.  I now do not have to share every feeling or opinion I have.  I just look to my intentions and pause.  Sometimes, I succeed and sometimes, I don't!  lolFunny thing that happened about 2 months ago...I realized via FB that one of my best friends from high school, her daughter goes to same college she and I went to years ago, in same city my dad (and his shiny new family) lived in.  I flipped through couple photos of her lovely daughter, whom I could not fathom she was in college...lo and behold, friends daughter is friends with my half brother's girlfriend.  How crazy is that, out of 20,000 students!  I recognized his girlfriend from perusing his FB - on yeah, BTW, I am not friends with my brother, lol.  Anyway, my girlfriend was so shocked, she called her daughter to ask about brother's girlfriend.  Her daughter told her that my brother essentially told his girlfriend not to hang out with the single girls in friend's daughter's group.  This type of jealous possessiveness tells me that my brother is a chip off the old block.  Well, good luck with that!  I don't know why people in relationships want to control each other...it will never work out in the long run.  Girls will resent it and either leave or sabotage (speaking from my own personal experience) and women that control their man essentially emasculates them.  Neither is optimal.  But I really do wish him the best.  He is very young, after all.  My dad, with all his flaws, was clearly the better parent because he instilled work ethic and consequences.  My step mother always let her kids do whatever they wanted.  Some of the lessons my dad wanted to relay to my brother, I saw my step mother undermine him consistently.I had to do a lot of soul searching and even some therapy related to my need to please my dad which competed with the just as powerful need to be independent.  But I finally was able to gain some perspective over time and distance and that is, that my dad was a great dad when I will a little kid and needed him the most...and that is a lot more than many people can say.  So, I finally learned to see him for what he is (limited) and forgave him and tried to convey peace and healing when he got sick and died.  I have no regrets there.  I also have no regrets about having nothing to do with my step mother - I do have conflicting feelings about my brother...so I just leave it at than and continue to ponder it and pray about it."},

{"title": "Friday Finally", "date": "Friday, June 22, 2018", "text": "To stop and smell the roses this week, I went to bed early every night (except last night), went to yoga twice and visited my DGM.  Yoga last night was just my friend T and I with our instructor.  He has been teaching us since 2012.  Last night he told us how well we  are doing.  I was shocked, he is not a talker  I replied that I felt and saw changes in myself that I know are from yoga and that is all I need.  It was good doing yoga twice this week, I want to walk 4 -5 times a week and do yoga 2-3 times when we retire.  I told DH that while I was on break yesterday I went through and did a draft of our new post retirement budget.  This week we both changed our addresses most places we could think off - banks, investment, professional licenses (4), utilities, work, insurance...I also put in the mail forwarding order for post office.  So, now all we have to do is turn in his paperwork, finish our 3 months work (pay off NYC trip off my credit card) and then next week our house will be paid off from the equity in our city house we are selling.  I have been really aware of getting rest and eating right, so physically I am doing well, but dang I am weary.  P.S.  I am well today, but yesterday i had a flare of epic proportions.  I had forgotten just how sick i can get, I had been feeling so well for so long.  Then BAM - out of nowhere...I know DH is tired and weary too.  But this weekend, we essentially unload the pantry/misc stuff (clocks, step ladder, other kitchen stuff) and plants go to MIL house and we are pretty much free to relax Saturday in our new space.  We will just have to try to ignore the ruined, partially torn up hardwood floor in the kitchen.  My pantry is in the utility room, so I can work in there and not worry about the torn up floor.  Oh, and I do have to move a shelf that is currently in utility room to garage so they can install flooring in there too.  But those two things are pretty minor compared to some of our recent work weekends of the past 3 years..  Sunday we will come back and clean where some furniture has been moved while we were gone and coordinate giving away few more things (another briefcase - this time to BIL, a sturdy for-sale sign for their yard, large TV, Armoire) and some stuff to purge (radio that does not work well, exercise ball that is going flat some more clothes and some old sheets) and then we just have to move stuff to extended stay hotel Tues and Wed night (and work a full week).  The buyer of our CH came over last night to measure a few places, she said she is really excited and we are excited for her to take it over and off our plates!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, June 19, 2018", "text": "Yesterday I forgot to include my little stop and smell the roses efforts...Sat we rode our bikes to the car wash and washed them.  Then we sat outside in the shade next to them and had some cold water and impromptu relaxation.  No TV, no phones.  Then Sunday I watched Ozzy and Jack Osborne TV show with DH and it was pretty funny.  They were riding along with a police department and they stopped a  vehicle and Ozzy talked to the man through a speaker and told him to exit the car and gave him several instructions including to \"do a little dance\" and then Ozzy said \"I am Ironman\".  DH and I laughed at that!  Then later Jack put on the padded suit to work with the police dog and he ran so the dog could be given the order to take him down.  It was so funny.  But do not watch if gestures or words offend!  haha.  You gotta know the Osborne's to get what I am implying, they have quite the potty mouths!  Last night I went home from work, did some laundry, fixed dinner, and put a couple of checks from insurance we cancelled up here in city in bank.  Then I watched couple episodes of Mike and Molly with DH.  I did not walk, I just needed to rest.  Then walked dogs and went to bed!  I was up at 4am yesterday, so I was tired.  I think I will do early to bed again tonight after hot yoga.  DH bought new golf clubs and I about had a fit Sunday when I found out.  I guess that explains why he gave me some cash last week.  He is trying to get me to buy another set of irons for myself, but I don't think I need them.  I think I need new grips on mine.  I don't want to spend money on that.  i have too many other things on my radar right now.  At least he sold his former set - fast!  Listed them on Sunday and they were gone last night.  He gave me the $300 to put into our cash pile.  We like to have a bit of cash on hand for emergency.  So, that is progress I guess.  10 years ago he would have just stashed the old set in the basement storage room.  He also gave away 2 of his nice briefcases to his nephew and his brother.  He won't need them when he retires.  Then we still have 2 others to sell...can you see a pattern?"},
{"title": "Minor Flood", "date": "Monday, June 18, 2018", "text": "We got to RH Friday at about 5:30pm.  We had the suburban loaded full to the roof again!  We just took one car on the 4 hour trip this time.  We pull up, get out and first thing we always do is let the dogs out into the back yard and I get their water bowl to fill it up.  I look into the kitchen and see tons of mold on the floor.  What?!  So the filter with the clear plastic tubing that is in the back, it has sat on the counter next to the fridge since we owned it.  I guess it is too tight a fit to put it behind (but why not above it, under the upper cabinet where it is out of the way/out of sight?!).  Anyway, last time we were here I moved the filter but DH says that would not have made it leak.  He said it just sprung a leak, these things happen.  Oh the joys of home ownership.  It is sort of ironic that we have had this RH for 4 years and have literally 2 more loads to move in and this is when our leak happens.  Our hardwood floors were up from the glue and warped, standing water on them for a week.  We immed put down towels and 2 fans on them, but it was too much water, too late.  So we went to look at tile.  The old hardwood floors go up against newer engineered floor that the recent owner put it - it did not match well and we did not really like either floor.  But at least it sort of flowed.  Oh well, we cannot match either now - too old.  I would not put wood in kitchen again anyway.  So, we considered a tile that would minic wood but the mess and the dust made me pause.  The flooring guy at Lowes said he just put in waterproof stainmaster vinyl strips with a lifetime guarantee and they were really happy with it.  So, the more I thought about it, the more this appealed to me.  Someday, if I decide I want to put in expensive floors, I will do the entire house.  But that time is not now.  We need to get this move done, have some work to do on the outside of the house (some trim to replace and patch/paint).  We are just going to do this nice clean vinyl, it is grayish wood look with reddish tones to compliment the reddish oak engineered it will but up against and we think it will look pretty with the white cabinets and gray walls.  Plus, it will lighten up the interior kitchen a lot.  I am still struggling though with the decision.  So, I have a week or two to ponder it.  The kitchen and utility room are this same older hardwood, so we will replace utility floor too - even though it was ok.  We will still have the same diff look in the dining room and living room - but that was the case before this leak, so that is that.  Someday I do dream of replacing the tile in the front part of the house (hall, guest bath, 2 guest rooms).  But I am not sure I will ever undertake such a messy expensive project.  At least it is tile, it is neutral and light - but it is really ugly.  Now is not the time to tackle that.  If we put inexpensive vinyl tile in the kitchen/utility now - IF we ever change it, it is not such an expensive/messy choice to change.  Anyway, have a great Monday.  I am back in the city, back to work and as I reminded DH, we have one weekend left in our CH and then we have to say goodbye to our view and my beautiful walk route and our lovely neighbors...but also all the things that don't work for us anymore (2 houses, CH expensive taxes, hard to heat and cool, too big and has carpeted stairs, noisy, people walking around our backyard to fish in the lake and makes our dogs bark, crowded pool, cars parked all down the street for the pool, no fenced yard for the dogs, and the traffic due to the growth of the already large neighborhood, and kids that just roam the neighborhood and ring doorbells and break in cars...just to name a few)."},

{"title": "Money Matters", "date": "Friday, June 1, 2018", "text": "Money especially matters when you treat it with respect.  It is crazy how when I was a young adult and made twice the money I make now, I never had any.  Once I met my DH and we began sharing we realized we had some goals in common and some bad habits in common.  Having another person made me want to become more accountable and responsible.  So, we discussed our goals and I wrote down our plan to get us out of debt on a napkin early in our dating relationship, as a preparation to discuss marriage.  My DH was going to just turn it over to me, but I wanted us both to work on it.  Not just one dictating to the other - that would spell disaster.  If not sooner, then later.  So, we both have become much more about saving some and spending some.  Making some investments and eventually we have a path to retirement.  Looking back, I think that even just little daily poor decisions about money had a cumulative effect.  Similarly, making better decisions has a cumulative effect.  As a young career person, one presentation by our HR department at our Fortune 500 Insurance Company made me commit to a 401(k).  The concept of compounding interest is powerful  displayed in tables for comparison.  Today, I am all about the bucket system.  Some buckets are literally stashes of cash and some are virtual buckets online, but the idea of saving for something separately from a combined pool of money has been very helpful for me.  Little daily decisions turn into yearly decisions and that behavior becomes habit.  I have a friend I enjoy coffee with, he said that when he was growing up and learning the right way to behave, instant gratification made him consider everything as negotiable.  You are negotiating with yourself for what you value.  I relate to that a lot.  Today I can consider long term goals over instant gratification and having a little money put aside here and there is my new value.  It is NOT negotiable.  I told DH that when we pay off our retirement home later this month after our city house sells, I already have a years worth of home insurance and real estate property taxes saved up.  Then right away, I will begin saving month to month small amounts to pay 2019 amounts.  He was pretty happy when I told him our plan.  Happy June and happy pay day everyone!"},

{"title": "Needs", "date": "Thursday, May 24, 2018", "text": "Yesterday I talked about learning what our individual needs are.  If we don't really know what they are, we could end up using substances or behaviors to make us happy.The list of all the possibilities given to me as a participant in a nutritional/diet plan are these:  (All:)  Personal time, give/do for others, recognition, movement, sleep, approval/acceptance, order and closure, time alone, territory (physical space all their own), financial security, being with people, competition, learning something new, anticipation, music, project, physical contact with others, variety of experiences, structured time, unstructured time, one on one attention, group relationships, empathy, humor, spirituality.I am sure there are others.  I never really had the insight to figure these out for myself as a young adult.  Now that I am older I have explored these so I can better meet them.  I used to rely on substances, superficial experiences, short term pleasure (shopping, eating, spending money) to have pleasure.  Now I am not as interested in immediate gratification, but better able to see the big picture and delay for goals and more fulfilling lifestyle.Last evening I fulfilled several needs and navigated a small obstacle with my DH.  My girlfriend T and I were going to take a full mattress and springs we are purging to my dear grandmother's apartment about 25 miles away, then take her set back to T's house.  I was giving my set to T, but my DGM had needed another mattress that was not as thick so she could more easily climb in and out of bed.  So, I gave my set to DGM and DGM set to T.  Well my DH informs me that it all will not fit in our SUV, but it will fit in my small truck, diagonally.  Well, I was not keen on the idea of driving down the interstate with mattresses catywompas, so I stalled and consider renting a truck.  DH suggests 2 options 1)  that DGM at 99 years old \"use a step\" or 2)  \"that she just buy a new set\".  He knows little of the elderly and their ways.  Neither option would be optimal.  I felt it was up to me to fix this and just leave him out of it.  My girlfriend T (who is my hero) borrowed her husband's full size truck and we get it all secured in the back of it, laying flat where we would be more certain it would not catch any air.DH taught me how to use the motorcycle straps (I had been needing to know this for a few years) and viola - I helped others, we got rid of a bed, my DGM has a mattress set that is newer and at least 4 inches shorter and T got her new-to-her bed (including the frame and mattress pad) - and heck, I even threw in 2 new pillows, and we are all happy.  And T and I learned how to use the bike straps, just in case we ever want to trailer our bikes.  I could have had DH help me more from the start on this, but sometimes I just leave him out of things when I know he will get frustrated and want to take the easy way out - usu involves 1)  doing nothing, 2)  throwing money at it or 3)  getting someone else to do it.  I want to learn more of direct cheapest way and doing it myself.  T and I considered wrestling 2 full size mattresses and springs from my house, to DGM apartment and then to T's house and up her stairs our wed workout.  I was only slightly less tired than my Tues night hot yoga!  I also took DGM my 2 working lamps to replace 2 of hers that were unreliable.  The first thing she said was \"'those are a lot smaller!\".  When I relayed this to DH, I told him it reminded me of something he would say.  Funny how DGM is blind until it comes to lamps that are much smaller.  They were slightly smaller and her other two dysfunctional lamps were supposed to be the same height, but one was like 3 inches taller.  WTH?"},
{"title": "How to Purge Stress", "date": "Wednesday, May 23, 2018", "text": "NatureAskMeditationActionSleep ThinkExerciseSorry this is so long.  But i guess i needed it.  Have been pretty stressed lately.  Situational stress I think.  But, stress is stress and many around me are stressed, so it has been on my mind...I just had to google how to spell exercise.  It was because I hesitated on it.  If I just did it quick, I would have remembered, ha!  I cannot overthink or multi task anymore.  I think it is a product of age and overload.  I have this a lot, plus more and more senior moments!  Instead of letting this get me down, the past year or so since I almost lost my Granny - I include the thought that even though I am feeling my age more and more I am privileged to reach late middle age.I read a post recently on one of my FB groups I like and the person was asking how to purge stress.  So I thought about it.  I have found myself thinking out this before I read this particular post.  I have thought about my own personal needs to try and figure out why I feel stress.  I use a coping skill.  I went through above and put some of my coping skills into an acronym.  These are not in order of importance.  Nature - is what my mother used to tell me I needed.  When I was a young woman away from her in the city working on my career, she would sense on the phone if I was tired and say you need to go outside.  When is the last time you got out of the city.  Now you will even hear people put a label on this called \"grounding\".  My mother was ahead of her time.  I think the thing about nature is that it makes me aware the universe is much bigger than I - and that immediately changes my perspective.  Whatever problem or discomfort I have, I am not alone and I am not the center of the universe.  It will pass even if I do nothing.Action - can I do something about the cause of the stress?  Can I make a list.  Can I figure out the worst case scenario and figure out a way to deal with that?  Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.  Maybe nothing even close to the worst will happen, but if I have planned for it JIC, then I am more ready.  I wonder if I should give up this philosophy, but old habits die hard.  The best action I can take is to just plan sometimes.  Planning helps steer me toward thinking before I take action and planning is an action in itself.  Can I plan a reward now or later to get me through something hard?Meditation is sort of the exact opposite of Action, although the better I get at harnessing my thoughts, the closer it resembles action to me.  Focus on my breath, my heartbeat, my place in the universe, being still and present and I am automatically calmer.  Google the vagus nerve and how important it is.  It is truly amazing how much this nerve impacts our wellbeing.  And it is amazing how just some deep breathing will affect the vagus nerve.  I mentioned this to my cousin who was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and she laughed and said \"Vegas?!\".  Well, it does sound the same.  I do think humor is important and it an integral part of my demeanor - but if I am too stressed, I cannot find the humor at first.  Ask for help.  Either from a person or from the universe.  To me, asking the universe is prayer.  I give thanks for my blessings and ask for God to help me.  Even if you don't believe in God, by being a living creature we can look to the universe and to science.  Energy is undeniable.  If you need to feel better, harness energy.  Energy from art, music, laughter, beauty, nature, love.  Read an inspiring poem, book, etc.  I swear just the power of classical music can reduce my stress.  I often listen to celestial space music to help me sleep.Sleep.  I have a chronic health condition and I have been trying to learn how to deal with it for most of my adult life.  My condition affects my digestion, my skin, my joints and my eyes.  It also gives me brain fog.  I get very depressed about my condition sometimes.  I have learned that stress and lack of sleep affect me very quickly when I have stress and lack of rest.  I have learned that by resting, I feel better.  This was a very hard adaptation for me.  I have never been one to get 8 hours of sleep.  Most of my education and professional life I got 4 -  6.  Well, not anymore I regularly get 8 and sometimes I even get 10.  And it is ok, my arse did not fall off!  Isn't that something I deserve without anything more?  Certainly something I have earned after working so hard so many years.  I plan to really experiment with this, maybe even take a nap once in a while (gasp).Think.  Think of what is causing the stress.  Not the cause of the feeling of stress, but why whatever trigger created a reaction in me.  Is it something real?  Am I in danger?  Am I doing something that is inconsistent with my values?  Am i in fear?  Am I angry?  Am I tired?  Do i have a need that is not being met?  I took a nutrition course through my temp employer about 5 years ago.  It had to do with making good food and eating choices.  Many of our food choices are made out of emotion.  It taught me that we all have essential needs and if we can tune into what theseneeds are, then we will be better able to find ways to meet these needs without food or other harmful substances and behaviors.  My vital needs are:  spirituality, order/closure, financial security, give/do for others, personal time, being with people, movement.Exercise.  For me, this has been such a part of my personal hygiene that it is as normal as bathing and eating.  If i do not move, i pay for it.  I have had an active program of movement since i graduated from high school.  When i was in public school, we had PE.  PE lead to some sports and dance in high school and that caused me to think about how exercise benefits us.  I have done it regularly every since - 30+ years.  Not only does it cause neurotransmitters to be produced in our bodies - but it causes strength and tolerance, confidence and helps me clear my head.  I can't live without it.  I plan to be doing yoga and walking as long as I am literally able to move.I hope someone reads this.  I get so much inspiration and connection from the things i read, especially blogs because they are so personal and not agenda driven.  I hope someone can connect with me on this entry.  What have i left out?  What do you do to combat stress?"},

{"title": "Waste", "date": "Friday, April 27, 2018", "text": "After having paired down our belongings the last couple years, part of my feeling of maintenance is to not buy stuff unless we are going to consume it, pretty much, or use it to make our lives easier - like my new steamer.  II buy clothes or shoes, they essentially have a purpose (like my hiking shoes or my new casual flat booties - I no longer need high heels).  And even then, I get rid of other less useful, less comfortable, less flattering items.  I got rid of 2 high heel booties that I will never wear once I am not dressing for the office.Even if we consume, I get the best deal I can find on products, use any coupons or points apps and buy the most economic size.  As for food, I buy a lot of vegetables that we can consume raw or cooked.  That way, if we don't consume them raw (salad), I can freeze it in the freezer and make smoothies (spinach) or cook in a soup or stirfry.  Produce is so expensive, I avoid waste.  I saw a great idea for using all food purchased on one of those life hack articles on the internet:  if you buy a plastic bin and use it in the fridge, you can easily sequester such items here when they are nearing the end of their shelf life and be sure you won't waste them.  I like it.  We have also discussed with our brother in law possibly getting some local pork, so DH and I are thinking of buying a new upright freezer before the end of the summer.  We had one a while back for years that I loved buying meat and other stuff on sale and stockpiling, but it stopped working about 2 years ago.  It was sort of handy that it shot craps when it did, because it was in our basement and it gave us plenty of time to get ride of it before we moved this year.  I used all the stuff out of it that we wanted and then I cleaned it out.  Then DH took the door off of it and we moved it out the back door (we have walk out basement) and into our large SUV and drove it around to the front and put it on the curb for heavy trash pick up.  Now we will just buy a new one for RH and have it delivered there."},

My mom used to give me lots of advice about how to get along with people.  When you are a female in elementary or middle school...or even high school...you can really have a hard time finding your footing with other young, insecure girls.  My mom used to tell me that people want to hang around someone who is friendly and smiles a lot.  She used to tell me to smile and act like I was happy, even if I wasn't.  I remember thinking how stupid that sounded.  I think that is what she was trying to convey though - a)  if I act happy, I will be happy and b) people feel happier around other happy people.  I had lunch with my aunts Sat and we watched the movie \"I Can Only Imagine\" and I though a lot about my parents.  They both died of cancer.  My mom loved her kids unconditionally.  My dad did, as long as you did not do something he disapproved of.  And my dad was such a narcissist that it was hard to tell what he wanted, I guess someone who reflected the things he liked (independence, confidence, intelligence, hard work, happy, attractive, fun, talent)...if you were less than, he either used that weakness to target (in my case it was my weight - he would tease me about my weight constantly) or he would just sort of go off and do his own thing because he saw you as someone who had nothing to offer him.  When I was younger, if I had seen a movie like this I would have had strong flashback feelings and would have cried and had to go home.  But after all the work I have done dealing with things (memories, feelings, resentments, regrets), it just caused me to reflect and then be glad that I too have found a comfortable personal day to day relationship with God, a God as I understand Him.  A God who loves me unconditionally.  My aunts and I talked about the movie and the complicated love of family in context of my niece's upcoming wedding next month.  I agree that God has a plan and I may not recognize it yet, but I am content in the knowledge that it will be revealed.  They reminded me that my sister did this same type of move to my mom, i.e. pretty much told her unceremoniously that she was getting married and eloped.  They acted surprised I did not recall this.  I reminded them that at the time, my mom was dying and my husband was taking chemo for his cancer.  I have very limited memories of that time.  I have very limited memories of most things!  HAI have shown our house 4 times now.  It seems that 1 of the 4 is ready to buy right now (a house - not nec MY house) and 2 of the 4 have to sell a house first.  So, one of the people we have shown it to is a man who lives nearby...he and wife want to downsize.  His wife is flight attendant - out of town till today.  We see if they come see it today after I get off work.  Whether we sell it on contingency...that will be something we have to consider...But we really liked this man and I sort of hope it works out that he is the one who buys it.We have done alright living so neatly in a house we can show quickly, but it will get old read quick.  This weekend we did a bit of scraping/cleaning up of our deck, but we can't catch a break weather-wise.  It rained a little bit both Sat and Sun (and has rained 3 of the prior Sundays).  It should dry out well today and then I am going to at least paint the perimeter of if tonight and maybe we can finish tomorrow at the latest.  That is cutting it close - DH has his elbow surgery Wed and I have to drive to RH state to take a 3 day continue education seminar Wed afternoon. This last project has hung over us for 2 months.  Will be such a relief too get it done.  Then maybe we will really be \"ready\" to sell and the forces will \"let it go\".  Fingers crossed."},
{"title": "Staging", "date": "Friday, April 20, 2018", "text": "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/?m=1 I am all about selling this house.  We are not even into week one of trying to live in a model home and be ready at the drop of a dime to show it...while we both work full time.  Oh joy.  I hope this does not have to go on for too long.  I know we will look back on this and laugh someday when re reminisce about this crazy busy time.  Sell this house!  I showed it to a woman and her daughter Sunday.  I am showing it tonight after work and I am showing it again this weekend!  Our patio home is the middle unit of 3 to a building.  It is 2 levels, the stairs being the large open cutout in the center of the unit.  So, no door to shut and the large windows facing southwest and the vaulted ceilings and tray ceilings in basement all make our unit very bright.  I love our home, but honestly, it really is too big for us.  DH just stays upstairs in the main living room all the time.  I prefer the basement because it is cozier and I don't like vaulted ceilings.  If I was a single person, I would for sure prefer the smaller ones.  But, my priorities have changed along this journey of my life.  I used to want more, more, more.  After dragging this stuff around and trying to maintain it, organize it, store it, move it...esp clean it and clean around it...I have learned the less I have, the less I have to curate it.  DH has said many times maybe we should have bought a bigger house for retirement.  I think not.  I am so glad we found the one we found and loved it so much.  it is the 2nd house we have bought together and both houses we both instantly liked just as much as the other person and both decisions to buy have been easy.  This RH has forced us to look at our possessions and assess how they will fit in our lifestyle.  More than just a move would have done because we are literally changing our lifestyles.  Any move I have made (and I have moved A LOT) has forced me to make some purging decisions.  Especially our last move of 2 households into one - we both had 3 bedroom houses!  But moving into this RH with no basement storage, has really made me prioritize and DH too.  He is the one who decided our budget and I am usually the conservative saver/budgeter, but I paused...how much?!  I asked.  Well, there went his view.  He did give up his hope for a view, but seriously.  Add $100k on for a view where we were looking.  And choosing the area we chose, near his mother and father  and sister and her husband, has been a God-send toward helping us get the home and get it ready for us to move there full time.  Thank goodness we went this route.  They have helped us fix things, let people in to fix things, gotten our mail, given us firewood, watered our plants, checked on our water heater, referred a handy man/contractor/mower to us...we could NOT have done this without our family.  Here are some pictures of city house we are selling.  I wish I had more before...but it was sort of unremarkable.  I do have before of my basement library and after...the bookcases are before, the carpeted room are the after.http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/?m=1My friend at work has a funny saying \"crank daddy out a hit\".  We were just talking this morning about activity level, health and how sitting at work all day 8 - 12 hours a day is not good for us.  It takes years to build up strength and endurance.  I walked with my girlfriend last night, T.  We were reflecting how long it has been since it was nice enough outside in this long Midwest winter.  Our usual 4 miles was harder last night.  We also discussed our yoga over the past 6 years and how we see progress being made.  But it has taken 6 years!  And this morning my work friend and I were talking about how just the last year of overtime has sapped us!  Years to build up, months to lose.  But, the important take away is that it is NEVER too late to start.  If nothing else, working out benefits my state of mind.  I think it will be more easy to fit in and more important than ever to continue this in retirement.  My DH has been eating a little bit better and walking more with golf and he has lost 12 pounds in 3 months.  Funny thing is, our doctor told him his sodium was low, so to drink less water.  What?!  That is crazy, but makes sense because he and I have been obsessed with water and I think it is because of 3 things:  1)  our Y*@i tumblers.  I love them!  2)  we gave up diet soda and 3)  this sort of goes together, but I think he and I both are more sensitive to salt/medications may be making us thirsty.  Either way, good news...unless there is some underlying problem I need to worry about...too late, I worry proactively.  We are really focusing on getting our required sleep every night with these last couple years of hard work on both houses, at our jobs and with my health condition.  So, here's to not worrying...not worrying that this weekend will AGAIN be cold and rainy and so we still will not be able to paint our deck...not worrying that my dogs health is tenuous and they will get sick again...not worry that my DH has underlying health issue...not worrying that I will soon be moving away from my 99 year old dear grandmother...not worrying that we won't sell our house soon enough...or fast enough...No, I refuse to worry.  I will focus on gratitude, rest and turning it over to Him...and lunch and a movie with my 2 aunts on Sat.  Life is good!"},
{"title": "Quote", "date": "Thursday, April 19, 2018", "text": "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/?m=1I recently listened to the Stephanie Madolf Mack memoir \"The End of Normal\".  She gives a quote that made me stop what I was doing and write it down:  \"...These banalities of everyday life aren't anything you think to preserve, much less cherish...\"  But anyone who has been through any type of trauma or heartbreak will tell you they totally are.  And I think that was what she was trying to say.  Her husband was Bernie Madolf's oldest son and was devastated to the point of suicide by his father's crime. She had 2 young children with Mark Madolf before he died.I am actually looking forward to hot yoga tonight, Tues night eagle pose eluded me on my left leg (my stronger balance leg) but I totally nailed it on the right!  Yes.  I still can barely suffer through the pose where he makes us stand on one leg and grab the other foot with both hands while face down to bent knee, then we straighten the knee keeping our head down to knee (I don't know what this one is called).  But I feel progress being made...I will get there!  I just recently got into a handstand position and could hold it (with a spotter).  I cannot get into it fluidly, I do a bit of huffing and puffing and maybe even a squeal, but I can support myself with my arms.  That is the first step...actually that is not true...the first step is saying \"I can do this\".  Have shown my house twice now.  I am showing it again this weekend I think.  And hopefully finishing all projects by cleaning/sandling/touching up my deck so we can put the sign in the yard Sunday.  Hopefully that will get us some more traffic the next weekend.  That weekend it is our neighborhood garage sale and the parade of homes - both happening weekend of April 25.  Of course I will be out of town at a continuing education seminar, but I am thinking of taking the dogs with me (we have a doggy door and a fenced yard at RH - so they can come and go while I am gone all day).  And then DH can focus on showing the house if nec.  He will be recovering from arm surgery (it is minor - some nerve damage, they will clean up some impingement happening at elbow).  So it will be perfect excuse for him to sit around and relax (and show the house, fingers crossed!).The woman last night who came has a buyers agent and this buyers agent has really worked me over good about the commission.  I finally suggested that we finish the discussion if her client actually liked my house.  Geez, why are we even worrying about it now?!  This is a young divorcing mother of 2 teenage sons.  A nurse.  Her parents were with her.  Very nice, from California.  The agent let me know that the parents are capable of writing a check for cash.  Note:  she did not say they were GOING to pay with cash.  So much posturing.  Uggggh.  I HATE it.  I spare all the teeth gnashing and griping for DH and basically take it out on my friend at work who is 1)  well versed in buying and selling property and 2)  is from California.  He told me surely we had sold it when I told him the buyers agent called me after the showing discussing some of my homes weaknesses the ceiling (our huge vaulted ceiling has been repaired/spot painted from water damage from a storm back in 2012), the carpet downstairs is old and shows dirt and our deck needs to be repainted.  Well, I laughed and said we are waiting for the weather to cooperate to do the deck and the carpet is easily replaced - with someone's personal preference and the ceiling is what it is.  It is not hideous to look at, not really all that noticeable, but a discerning eye can surely see it and plus, we will have to disclose the water damage anyway.  DH and I were surprised nothing was said about our old white appliances.  Was she posturing or just thinking down the road if she does work with me.  I don't know.  I just know that this house is going to sell soon.  The sooner the better as we try to live in the house with 2 dogs and work full time downtown - 20 miles away.  But, it sure is fun living in such a clean and uncluttered home in the meanwhile with almost all projects done (except that pesky deck!).After the showing last night, we exchanged a set of bath towel bars at the home store and went out for dinner and it was nice to just relax and not work on either house for an hour.  We talked a bit out our future and it was nice.  Then we came home and watched Josh Gates on TV.  HIs new show is called Legendary Locations and we enjoyed it.  And I worked on this afgan that I am making for my friend who is fostering my kitty all these months.  Her favorite color is blue so I used a medium bright cornflower sort of blue and a baby blue (it looks white in the photo, but is not) in this fun chevron pattern.  I know she will like it.  I have to sort of hurry though, because I find I don't work as well on crochet in the warmer weather.  I am outside as much as I can be and it is too warm working on a blanket on my lap in the heat.  Happy Thursday!"},
{"title": "Perspective", "date": "Wednesday, April 18, 2018", "text": "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/?m=1I am struggling a little with some personal stuff in my life with family.  Aren't we all?  I am worried about my niece and her getting married.  I project my own mistakes and choices and have a hard time talking to my sister.  She is VERY quiet and private and deals with things much differently than I.  So, I have a cousin I am close too also dealing with mid life, worry about our family older and younger family.  The sandwich years.  Hahaha.  But she and I deal with stuff by talking about it.  We have emailed back and forth a lot lately.  It really helps.  What I come away with essentially is that all these things that feel overwhelming.  I take then to God.  I believe in something bigger than me.  If I have a friend of loved one that does not believe in God, then I can talk to the nature/universe/harmony type of thing.  I don't have a problem couching it like that.  If someone thinks that is wrong, then that is a religion I would not be comfortable with.  Wow, religion...how did I get here?  Talk about a blog bomb!  Boom.  But, I know that opinions come from people with life experience.  Complicated, multilayered, unique and sometimes messy lives.  I just know what works for me is perspective.  I am learning later in life to sit back and be quiet and listen, likely my perspective will be seasoned if I let it.Hope your Wednesday speaks to your heart today."},

I said I worked and would have to do evenings or weekends.  Then nothing.  Then today she said that since she was bringing me clients, I implied I would be willing to pay the 3%.  I said no, we will be willing to work with her, but her clients need to work that out with her.  Then she sent another long email telling me why I should use an agent.  I again refused and said if we change our mind down the road, we would let them know.  Then she emailed back asking if she could see the house Wednesday.  I suggested 5pm and haven't heard form 3 hours.  This is gonna be a long couple months..."},
{"title": "Now or Never", "date": "Monday, April 16, 2018", "text": "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/?m=1When I posted the title, I had the Elvis song playing in my head.  Ear worm.I used to have a really busy job in the insurance industry.  In college, I majored in business.  It was the 80's and I was under the influence of such movies as Working Girl (Melanie Griffith), The Secret of My Success (Michael J. Fox) and Trading Places (Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy).  I considered a job in a lab (biomedical engineering - I loved chemistry but hated math) and something more artistic (decorating - too impractical).  My parent's felt I needed something more concrete since I was the first person in the family to go to college and they persuaded me to at least take typing and computers, so business made sense.  I figured I would probably end up as a secretary, but secretly longed to go to law school.I finished with a BS in marketing.  I got a job in sales and hated it.  I had worked retail through college and like it mostly, but hated the hours and the flakiness of the employees.  Plus it did not pay well and you were on your feet all day.  But I liked helping the customers and displaying/showing the merchandise.  I consider fashion merchandising and advertising, but figured I would have to move far away and I missed my mom and sister too much in college.  I applied for a job I found in the paper that was a good salary, but was not sales.  I got it.  Be careful for what you wish for.  I should clarify and say I did not get the actual job, but a slightly different version of what I applied for.  The other applicant that my hiring manager liked had a wife and kid.  My manager told me this, something you could never say today.  So, he hired the other guy and told me that he really wished he could hire us both.  I figured he was just saying that to be polite.  Well, about 2 - 4 weeks later I heard from him again.  Would I want to take the job that was just a step below and possibly work into the same position down the road?  Sure!  It was $23,500 a year and full benefits.  I actually would have medical insurance, vacation days and a 401(k).  Whooooopiiieeee.This job was challenging but entertaining.  Everyday was something new and different.  We were quickly given very thorough training and authority.  We learned a lot.  I excelled.  It was unique enough, I got to use my left brain creative side.  But very time intensive and I worked long hours.  For many years.  I moved around, different states.  Got moved up and promoted, learned to specialize.  I liked the nature of my job overall, but 2 things remained challenging...time management and politics.  We were given much training and pep talks in time management.  No preparation at all for politics.  Haha.  I really had no help at all in either area.  My father was a blue collar worker who essentially worked for his friend and my mom was a bank teller who hated management.One of the things we were taught by Big Insurance was, only touch something once.  We had daily \"diaries\" of stuff to do on each \"file\" assigned to us.  Often the job was so overwhelming with \"fires\" that come up from tasks being forced up on us from new \"files\" or people calling and yelling at us that we would just move the diary ahead a few days, or a week.  This did not help in the long run, these tasks were still waiting for us, along with new \"fires\".  So, we were taught to 1)  do what you could to move the file forward any time you looked at it, 2)  diary ahead realistically and 3)  each piece of mail you got - put it where it needed to go when you first touched it.  Don't just stick it in a pile.  Summarize the mail in the computer database and file it with the appropriate hard file.This has served me well in life.  I hate junk mail, I hate all mail, really.  Paper or electronic.  I do what I can to minimize it.  I elect to get electronic billing on all accounts and zero junk email (I opt out of all and create spam for all the offenders who ignore) and when I open paper mail I deal with it right then...a)  keep and file or b) shred and throw away.  I hope to add more efficiencies in my life like this (systems) upon retirement, so that I won't become bogged down with the slack routine and have loose ends.  I don't deal well with loose ends.  I would almost rather do something wrong than do nothing!  Ha.  Anyway, this has been your lesson in 90's Big Insurance rah rah boom bah pep talk about how to cram more into your day.  Not really, this is a way I can do my chores and have more fun.Have a great Monday!"},

{"title": "Let Go", "date": "Friday, April 13, 2018", "text": "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/?m=1The other day on FB I saw a meme that said when we let go of all the things that are holding us back and making us sad, resentful, stuck in the past, anxious...we make room for more positive things.  This is a more abstract, psychological aspect of rightsizing, but just as important as physical right sizing.  Went to hot yoga last night and tried this.  There are a couple of posses that just elude me.  Yoga poses can be like a golf swing, or learing to ride a motorcycle...there are numerous different stages that you have to remember to do all either simultaneously or as part of a sequence.  It is hard to remember all the things sometimes and you see the results accordingly.  Last night I was trying to get my folded leg around my standing leg as eagle pose and the instructor says \"core, core, core\" - like a lightbulb!  I did it!  Then I even did the other side.  He usu has to come over and move my foot around my standing leg.  When I start to learn something new, I can feel overwhelmed.  What I need to remember, is that eventually certain practices (motorcycle skill, golf, yoga, letting go and praying)...these all can develop into habits that become easier and eventually 2nd nature.Have a wonderful Friday and I hope you can let something go that is not working for you and make room for something better."},

{"title": "D for Debt", "date": "Thursday, April 5, 2018", "text": "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/?m=1I realized I am a letter behind.  I will catch up Monday.Debt is a symptom.  Maybe people go into debt because they don't know anything else.  Maybe people go into debt to avoid dealing with something.  At the basic level, debt is spending more than you make.  Or, at least choosing to pay later instead of sooner.  Speaking of debt, now my girl Chihuahua is sick.  In the last 2 months, between getting cat all her shots so she could live safely with my friend's cats for a few months and my 2 dogs being sick, I think we have spent over $1300.  All of it charged...then the usual expenses confronted in the first part of a year...taxes, continuing education, professional licenses, HOA...then the bathroom tile...I am on a strict no spending plan now.  Which means I have to work to earn...so after being up most of the night with my sick female dog, I sure did want to stay home today.  But I managed to get up and in on time.  I am glad DH has a work from home day, he can keep an eye on her.  All she did was whimper last night.  We took her to emergency vet, they ruled out anything obvious/life threatening, so we brought her home.  She has been increasingly uncomfortable last 3 days, culminating in extreme discomfort and vomiting last night.  Also speaking of debt, the opposite of it.  Before I got home to find my little girl sick, I spent time with my dear grandmother.  She and I went through a coin collection of hers and counted it all out and catalogued it so that DH and I can liquidate it for her.  it was $70 and some change face value but included some old coins, steel pennies, some Mercury and Liberty dimes and other silver coins, like some old quarters.  She will be happy to get that done, she said she might as well do it now and enjoy a treat - I wholeheartedly agree.How will you treat yourselves today?  I am going to say some prayers and breathe deep and go to 2nd hot yoga this week, tonight and bed at 8:30pm!  I do have a man that saw my \"coming soon\" house listing.  He wants to see it when we are ready to show it.  That is a little treat, even if nothing comes of it.  I realized a certain number of people going to have to see our listing before we find \"the one\".  Have a great Thursday!Psalm 50:10-11 “For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.

{"title": "C for Choices", "date": "Wednesday, April 4, 2018", "text": "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/?m=1I got my labs the weekend I was out of state for a wedding.  My numbers all look really good.  It made me think about personal choices.  I have been improving my eating slowly and sometimes too slowly, out of a desire to be more healthy and stay trim, but also because of all my stomach woes.  In my search to find answers about my stomach problems, I fluctuate between the hope that I can find medicine that helps and being able to find a lifestyle/eating formula that helps.  If medicine helps, then I don't have to be personally accountable and I don't have to feel like I have failed.  But, the longer I travel this journey, the more I am understanding that what I put into my body affects me, just like it affects anyone - our health.  But almost immediately I can feel horrible and be sick for hours or days.  So, I keep trying to tweak it.  My cholesterol, good and bad are good, my glucose is good.  My blood pressure good.  My vitamin D still on track going on 2nd year in a row.  My weight is good.  I am going to keep trying to put one foot in front of the other.  After all, isn't it better that I do have accountability and realize how I feel is in my own control and directly related to the choices I make?Here are some of the changes I have made over the years to improve my health.  I exercise (walking and yoga).  I eat at home mostly.  I limit carbs and processed food.  Carbs i eat are potatoes, quinoa, rice and home made bread/biscuits.  I eat more vegetables, fruit and lean meat.  I have pork or beef maybe once a week.  I cut dairy 2 years ago.  I limit sugar, but when I have sugar I have a small amount of what i crave.  I eat my potatoes i love, but switch to sweet potatoes half the time.  I stopped drinking soda 2 years ago.  No artificial sweetener.  I have been doing intermittent fasting since Nov and feel it is working for me - i skip breakfast.  For the past year or so, I have been eating very small evening meal - sometimes broth (google bone broth) or smoothie only.  In my smoothies I put bunch of spinach, ground flaxseed/chia seed, vegan protein and fruit.  I blend with almond or coconut milk.  Only caffeine is 2 cups of coffee in the morning.  i put a mix of nutrients in it that include cacao, lacuna, collagen, maca and coconut sugar - along with spices like nutmeg, cinnamon and cardamom.  I enjoy it so much, it has helped me cut back to almost no more artificial powder creamer (i know, i know).  Every day i have 1 green tea and take vitamin, mineral and herbal supplements and after much research and trial and error, have found a combination that helps me feel my best (including vit C, vit D, B chewables, probiotic, digestive enzymes, fish oil, calcium, zinc, magnesium and special eye supplement).  On Friday and Saturday I pretty much eat what I want.  The rest of the week is pretty regimented.  What are you doing to be healthy?"},

Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life[a]?28 “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? 31 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.I forgot to mention that I sold a pricey pendant that I had made few years ago.  It was never my style and I would never wear it.  So, I made $526 on it, $420 after PM cut.  I am putting it toward my Roth for 2018.  I am happy to have it gone.  Sometimes just a small step toward something, builds momentum (saving for retirement).  My husband is through with his accumulation, but I am really not.  I am 13 years younger than my husband and although we could be able to live frugally on his retirement till I get my social security in 15 years, the reality is that things happen and I need to continue to plan and accumulate just in case.  If something happened to him prior to my getting SS, I would have to go back to work and I am fully capable and willing to do that.  I am giving time now for spending it with him, prepared to go back to work at an older age and likely a more difficult task (difficult to find anything at all at an older age/longer break in employment, difficult to find anything rewarding that will not be at least partially physical (standing, lifting, carrying) and difficult because I will be older and out of the routine.  But it is a chance I willingly take to spend time with DH now while we are still relatively young and in good basic health.P.S.  My  dog is better, he has a kidney stone and we are giving him special food and started him on heart meds for his heart murmur.  So, if the expensive food does not help dissolve the calcification, he will be as strong as he can with his heart, for surgery.  I also caved too and begged my Dr for steroids.  All the stress of moving, selling the house, the dog being sick, worry over my grandmother and my cousin etc just had me doubled over in pain.  I took one dose and immediately felt better.  I am truly going to focus on going totally healthy eating, but while we are back and forth moving and living out of boxes/extended stay hotel, I just want this plan in place so that I can function.  I cannot afford to be flat on my back now.  This fall, I will vow to never eat fast food again, if I can just get through this time of transition.  I was so sick last night I just sat down and had a good cry and immediately felt the release...March is almost over and we are gonna make it out alive if it kills me!"},

I drove 8.5 hours Thurs and 9 hours back Sun.  We did take a 30 min detour and pop in to my retirement home on the way back yesterday.  My Uncle got to see my RH and we checked in on the tile work in progress.  I think I am really going to love it.  Looks really nice with the cool gray and white of my bathroom.  The tile is warm yellowish beige tones.  Warms up the room.  My contractor complimented my choices.  I think all he has left to do is grout and clean up.It was great to get home to my DH.  He stayed home with the doggies.  He was not thrilled at the prospect of being in the car with my VERY hard of hearing aunt and uncle.  And repeating one self over and over, practically yelling is tiring, but I was honored to be able to drive them and take care of them.  They have done so much for my sister and I.  Letting us come stay with them in the summer, showing me how much they love me, etc.  GREAT people.  So, DH had dinner ready for me when I got home.  He even did grocery shopping and did some packing!  I was so proud of him and so glad to be embraced in a comforting hug.  Seeing my cousin's lovely young daughter and just all the reminiscing just made me tired and emotional.  So, I just chalked it up to that...then I relized that today is the day my Dear Belated Husband died in 1993 at age 32.  So, I have that making me blue, it is cold a raining here, so that adds to it...it is Monday, eta.Except those things are not the main source of my emotion today...Our older dog, he is about 11 years old...well he is just not doing well.  He is declining in movement and sleeping a lot, but he still eats and drinks and gets around pretty good.  Well, DH said he has begun intermitten yelping once in a while.  DH thougth at first he was just dreaming, but he did it 3 or 4 times after I got home last night.  I was convinced he waited for me to get home and would not make it through the night, but he did and DH took him to vet today.  I missed 2 days next week, so it is hard to miss this week, but I am leaving early because while he is at the vet having tests, I am just sick to the point of distraction.  I realize he is getting older and I accept that dogs have a much shorter life span that I would wish...but I am really upset thinking it is so near and worrying that he is in distress.  Also, I told my DH I really am going to be devastated when he dies not matter what/when...but the possibility of it being so soon and before we move to Arkansas breaks my heart into a million pieces.  I see the pain in DH eyes too.  So, we have to be strong and grateful for every second with him.  Wish us luck.  I will try to be back tomorrow.  Have a great Monday.  My lovely cousin is off to her enchanted honeymoon, where I bask in the happiness of my cousin - its her daughter and she is so happy.  I am going to hang on to that, because they are both special to me."},

{"title": "My Love Hate Relationship with March", "date": "Thursday, March 8, 2018", "text": "I was born in March, so was my mom and my DGM (dad's mom).  It always meant just a peak at spring, after the long winter.  I grew up in the Midwest.  I lived away from the Midwest for 13 years.  I came back 18 years ago.  I still hate winter.  Or maybe I hate trying to get around outside when the weather is icy or snowy.  The hate part comes from losing my mom in March 1991.  She turned 48 just 4 days prior to her death.  And my late husband SCG died in March 1993.  He was only 32.  Now I have a dear friend, S, who died at 47 in 2014...on March 7.  So yesterday and today I think of her.  I am sure i will write more on S.  I miss her so much.  There are some things i need to unpack there with that.  I will write about that later.  Tues was dedicated to my DGM.  She turned 99.  After working late, i went over and took her  some fancy cupcakes.  She loved them.  I saved 2 for DH too.  Last year I found this cupcake store when I looked for a special treat to take her for her 98th bday.  She was in the hospital last year.  Almost died.  It was quite a spring last year.My cousin N who has cancer sent me a frantic text tues to come help her, that her work was screwing around with her.  I had to text her and tell her I could not leave work.  I really need all my hours, things are a bit hectic with time and expenses right now, getting some work done on RH to move in and work on CH to get it sold.  I felt bad on one hand, but sort of annoyed on the other because when I called and texted later, she did not respond.  I have to just focus on my lane and let her follow her journey.  Anyway.  Sometimes the best thing we can do when we feel like we can barely take care of ourselves is to reach out and \"do\" for another.  Be an ear for someone else, help someone with something, give someone a ride...maybe even just a text or a call...smile at a stranger.  But get out of our own head!Last night I went to a hot yoga class...first one since our other instructor left in Nov.  It was good.  I slept very well.  Gonna try to go again tonight.  I don't do 2 in a row a lot.  So, might be a bit challenging.  I would rather walk outside tonight, but is still a bit cool and gets dark too soon.  But the clocks change Sat!I just read this quote on \"the Garden of Pensiveness\":  \"To strengthen the muscles of your heart, the best exercise is lifting someone else's spirit whenever you can.\"   -Dodinsky"},

{"title": "Couple of Befores", "date": "Monday, March 5, 2018", "text": "So we got last 2 bookcases moved and the less sturdy shelf from Ikea we will use for shoes and folded clothes in back of closet.  All three along with a bunch of coats and a few dishes and other odds and ends fit back of suburban!  Oh, and my new rug for sitting room!We literally had to remove chair rail moulding and sledge hammer the 4th bookshelf into the dining room/library.  Then I painted them white again.  Looks a bit crowded, but good!  I will not be keeping the large round table and hutch in there for ever.  It will be better with a smaller table.  I will prob wait until my niece or nephew get a house and then see if they want the set. Then I put new rug in sitting room and moved that smaller rug into library.  The thing I am most excited about though is that we are getting rid of moldy pink shower.  The shower has no fan and a door, plus the floor is not angled toward the drain.  So water just sits all around and mold has grown that I tried everything to remove.  The shower is large and plain off white tile all the way up from the pink tile, so we are leaving that.  They will take out the pink tile and built in seat, angle the floor and put a strong fan/light in the top.  Our contractor also pointed out that the grout had been covered or replaced with silicone caulk down around the bottom where all the water stands/mold grew.  We think these changes will fix the mold.  (I should probably say mildew).  My husband helped me take off the little door and it already opened the look so much!  We decided to try it with no curtain for a while, see if we can leave it off all together. Next time we go to RH, we will have all tile floor in master and updated shower.  I can hardly wait!  It was truly the last thing that we are going to change that made us sad every time we looked at it.  A few other changes will have to wait until we can save up for them, but the house just looks amazing to us and we just love being there.  Have a wonderful week.  Hope someone reading drops by and tells me what spring cleaning/organizing/purging/improving has inspired you lately."},

{"title": "Sometimes the \"Interwebs\" Help", "date": "Tuesday, February 27, 2018", "text": "I just read a column by \"Ask Amy\" and learned about a concept that was helpful.  It has been around a while, but I had not heard of it.The Ring Theory, as started by a pair of professionals/writers in Psychology Today article.  The people closest to the person having a problem receive comfort and support from outer circles.  The circles outward represent next of kin, closest family, closest friends, distant family, etc.  If someone needs to vent, they pass it outward.  Support and comfort in, bitching out.  Totally makes sense.  Stuff like this, you learn from your support system.  My mother passed away when I was 24 and I miss out on stuff like this.  Now, I will pass this on, implicity or explicitly.  My sister and I experienced this in practice when my mother was dying and we were present with my father in a little tightly wound ball.  Boundaries to this day questioned by my aunt.  My mom's sister.  It goes a little like this...my father, my sister and I were deciding whether to take my mother off of life support.  My mom's step father, whom she was not close to, offered stories of his ailments during a time that we just needed to process what to do about our mom.  My father was swift and sure in his recoil.  My sister and I more confused and in a daze, we were too young to understand.  This may have had a more slow, long term and sustained effect on us.  Sometimes I think this is just one way men and women differ...in how things affect us.  My dad did not miss a beat, he felt a certain way and just moved threw life and I was more questioning always.  I have been like this forever.  Maybe not as much now.  My mother passed at peace and having forgiven and accepting her step father.  For what?  I am not sure and will never really know...but I know my mom's mind was at ease.  My mom's step father has a child that I cherish today.  She is my mom's youngest sister.  Same mother.  She is one of my favorite people in the world.  Another such treasured person is her sister, my mother's next youngest sister, same father as my mom.  She and I have been close since I was one year old.  These two sisters see things and express themselves differently.  The sister who shares my mother's father...she sees things one way.  The sister who had same father, sees things differently.  Aunt who is more outspoken, she felt slighted about her mother being placed very deliberately - by my father, into the next outer layer of \"The Ring\".  I have heard this feedback over the years 100 times.  I have gone the gamut of horrified outcry...over to a much milder form of understanding...about this situation.  Weathered by age, experience and just plain knowledge about perspective and life-position.  I may think about this more...but I probably will not change much in my understanding about it, from this moment forward.  The internet helped me today."},

{"title": "My Eyes are Bigger than My Suburban", "date": "Friday, February 16, 2018", "text": "So, we had more confidence in the cargo abilities of the suburban than it actually has.  We could only fit 2 of the bookcases in, but we got all the last of our books loaded too!  Next time we go down, in 2 weeks, we can take the other 2 bookcases.  DH was disappointed, but I reminded him how great it was that after this load we will have all our books down at RH.  And the only thing worse than books, might be hanging clothes to move! Anyway, we have a plethora of books.  But my DH loves books and has a nice collection of encyclopedias and was not even open to consider getting rid of them.  Also we both love similar mystery/crime novels and have a nice collection of fiction and so we have allowed for half and half.  I truly do plan to get back into reading in earnest once we are retired and I am not reading at work every day.  I have an advanced degree which required a lot of boring reading and I dreamed of the day when I would be able to read fiction.  That day is close!  And not a moment too soon.  I truly am getting to a place where my age and chronic condition are making me feel like I could not continue to work much longer, even if I wanted to!  I am sure it is just a culmination of the past year stress and intensifying that I know we will literally be unable to avoid as we continue to move stuff, finish fixing up projects of RH, fix projects of CH we are selling, list/show/sell CH, live in temp location while DH finishes his last few months, get all my licenses/CE moved to retirement state, finish taxes, worry about my DGM and the effect of all this on her, continue to help her with her books, etc.  My stomach just hurts thinking about it. So, I take a deep yoga breath.  Practice my meditation.  Continue my walks (I walked after work yesterday!).  And do the little day to day steps to help all this happen.  I.E.  we are following the money we are waiting on from the sale of our expensive car - we are using it to pay off our phones and other costs, like the expense of getting our downstairs CH carpet stretched and cleaned.  In this same month we have gone from expensive service with large cellular provider to the plans at WM.  Going from $207/month to $120/month.  But, we did have outlay of significant costs of my new phone and DH year old phone he had to pay off.  My intention is to wean off my phone more, of the couple year life that these phone essentially have.  After 2 years both my last 2 models got very slow and do not hold a charge.  I do not have IPhone, which was what the media focused on few months ago - but I seriously doubt this problem/feature/design is limited just to iphones.   One of the big reasons I have been tethered to my phone was the constant activity required to sell stuff.  I am finished doing that.  Although the cash was nice, it came with it's own cost (serious time drain!).  I have pretty much officially changed over my wardrobe to what I think will be useful casual (daily stuff, walking, yoga, kayaking, hiking and golf), from my corporate wardrobe.  I hope to never look back, but if I do, I can buy new stuff!  Just last night I used my last credits from clothes we sold to buy a 2nd hand hooded raincoat and a pair of slightly used Bean boots.  I am so excited!  I just go through in my mind what I will get rid of...and I will prob get rid of a couple coats that are duplicative and sort of dressy that lack waterproof/hood.  I will also get rid of pair of cheap/non waterproof boots and a pair of slippers to make room for new.   So, that are some things that make me happy while I am dreading/anxious about my looming to-do list.  Hope you all have a great Friday.  I will have a great weekend, but I will be tired from loading and unloading, a little unsatisfied we could not get all the bookcases and starting a strick elimination diet due to my stomach issues I have had for over a week.  I just have to focus on my gratitude, my God and His plan."},

{"title": "Would Rather be at Work", "date": "Thursday, January 18, 2018", "text": "I would rather be at work than spend my time as I did yesterday.  And as a temp, that is saying something.  Sorry to repeat, but I am tired.  Was relaxing this last weekend with my husband watching some TV, looking forward to my long weekend/day off on Monday.  10pm Sunday I got a text from a relative indicating that another relative had serious symptoms and was in the hospital.  Texter was going to bed, that was all they knew (the relative texting me was in another state).  The next morning, I followed up and learned that my relative in the hospital had 2 masses, one in her lung and one in her brain.So, I went and visited patient Monday afternoon when she was visited by 2 doctors.  One a Radiology Oncologist and one a Neurosurgeon.  There she was laying in her bed after hearing that she had these 2 masses that morning.  I tried to just be with her and help her process and then after the doctors came, I wrote down notes and prepared as best I could to pass this information along to her son who had gone to talk to the patient's 90+ year old mother.  Patient and her mother are close to my DGM and I.  Neither doctor would say it was cancer, but the oncologist said it was \"cancer looking\".  The neurosurgeon tells us the mass in her brain is so large, they want to remove it surgically Wednesday.  This information is relayed and we are all in shock and family from 4 states are mobilizing.  I am close to another family member that flew in to be there for surgery yesterday, so she is staying with us and driving one of our cars.  I told her it was my way of helping.  We spent the evening Tues night seeing patient and then went back Wed morning.  I took Wed off, but plan to finish working Thurs and Friday.  I do not have benefits for days off.  No work, no pay.  After she went to surgery, we went to spend some time with her mother.  We came back in time to learn patient was through brain surgery (took about half the time they initially told son) and waiting for a bed in ICU.  Son was still home cleaning and doing daily chores/resting.  So, neurosurgeon talked to us.  It was surreal when neurosurgeon told us that the tumor did not have definite margins where it was next to the brain, so he had to essentially cut it out of the brain to be sure he got it all.  Then he indicated that she was conscious and was responding and showing signs of moving her eyes to the right ok, but not to the left as well.  He said the brain area where the tumor was involved eye movement.  He said this may or may not be permanent.  He apologized to us for that, and said he did the best he could do.  He did unofficially say that he thought it was metastatic carcinoma (i.e. tissue in brain was cancer that came from the lung). The next steps/treatment plan/prognosis would come from cancer team.  I have felt like crying, but it does not come.  What has come is literally an overwhelming sense of exhaustion and my cousin really hit the nail on the head when she explained this is really only the beginning...(of a difficult battle)."},

{"title": "Thursday Snow Day, Finally Friday\n", "date": "Friday, January 12, 2018", "text": "I stayed home yesterday.  The temp dropped from way above freezing to below while it rained iceapprox 8 to noon.  We did not get a whole lot of ice, fortunately.  And since I go in 6:20am to arrive by 7, I prob would have been fine, but after the ice the forecast was snow, so I was more concerned about the commute home.  One year it showed a couple inches during the workday and it took me 3 hours to drive home.  It was nice, DH stayed home too.  Plus, I had just washed my car and took photos to list it online for sale, so it seemed sort of like tempting fate!I did laundry and listed a bunch of more of our old work clothes we won't wear if we are retired.  I have had more luck selling men's clothes/shoes lately than mine.  The website I use (Poshmark) I think is exploding, but instead of more selling, I think people are all wanting to get rid of stuff and it has become a lot like an online garage sale.  I see genuine leather jackets go for $20-$25 and nice leather shoes for $8.  It is fine to get rid of large hoard of stuff, but if I am giving it away, I would rather just load the car and give it away, literally.  Which I also did.  My DH has started to work on his closet and we have spent couple of hours 2 diff days down in it sort of getting an overview of strategy.  I think I now have removed most of the stuff of any value he does not want to keep and have listed it (like 10 really nice canvas/twill type Tommy Hilfiger shirts he has had laundered professionally that are spotless.  Also about 10 of his really nice basic suits).  The rest he is 1) keeping - I am not sure where he is going to put 50 Harley tee shirts, lol; 2)  donating or 3) throwing away.  But at least, we sort of have it figured out.  I also listed his travel golf bag and my car online!  As far as staging my house, I have decided that the 4 bookcases we are keeping in our basement, we are going to go ahead and move them and stage the space another way.  I have a large picture and a chair I am going to move from master bedroom down there.  DH and I think the more bigger stuff we can move each trip, the better off we will be.  We may even sell the Suburban before next fall.  It is 19 years old and we got a good deal on it, but we had to put a little more into fixing some things than we had planned.  We have just about decided that rather than keeping an older vehicle that is not exactly what we want or need (we don't really need 4wd, but if we do, we would almost rather have a truck).  So, if we get our stuff basically all moved without having to rent a trailer or spend way more time, then the repairs will have paid for themselves and we will go ahead and cut our loss.  We also have a 14 year old Camry, but it is low miles and we think it will last for years and is more economical, so we think we will keep it longer and maybe get a small truck instead of old suburban and my new expensive SUV.  So excited to consolidate our assets/efforts and get rid of debt!I am ready to move and want to do more, but really we are sort of in a waiting pattern until we can get couple more loads to RH, including getting the bookcases out of basement.  First we will move all the Christmas stuff and some other stuff (cabinet from dining room) i have packet up.  Then next trip (early Feb we will move the bookcases).  Then move loveseat out of the basement, get the carpet re-stretched and cleaned.  Then move couch and chair from master downstairs and stage with the large painting.  Move dresser from master to RH and late winter, move large shelf from master to RH master closet for sweaters/sweatshirts/shoes.All while I am trying to help take care of Granny and work full time.  Ugggghhhhh.  I will be glad when this is all over.  We have tried to talk Granny in to moving with us, but she thinks she cannot leave her daughter and cannot intrude on us.  Actually I would consider it an honor to care for her and much prefer to her going to a nursing home and also, it really would be much easier for me.  But I truly doubt she will come with us."},
{"title": "Funk Be Gone", "date": "Tuesday, January 9, 2018", "text": "Fri and Sat last week, I was in a funk.  Sunday was very relaxing and replenishing.  We stayed home, cooked some white chili and some homemade bread and relaxed.  I even took a walk, as it got up into the 30's.  We have had weather closer to teens for 2-3 weeks, which is little below normal here for this time of year.  I loved getting out and feeling the sun and looking around at nature.  Esp knowing, it still could be several weeks before I get to do that again.I wonder if part of my problem is that I am moving this year.  I have noticed friends sort of back away a little.  I don't blame them.  People are busy.  I had a cousin come into town but was sick, so we did not get together out of fear I will get sick.  I am on an immunosuppressant and nervous about the flu.  She went on down 40 miles or so to see our other cousin, who has also been sick.  I told them next time.  I had coffee with some friends last night after work and it was great!  I did some more project cleaning (including my entire downstairs) and my pantry and under kitchen sink.  I belong to a FB group called \"A Bowl Full of Lemons\" and they have a challenge room/area each month.  January is the kitchen!  That feels good.I also dumped a car load of my DH clothes off at thrift store.  I listed 4 more of his suits and several other things and he threw 2 boots in for thrift and 1 pair out from wear.  He is really getting on board and I am proud of him.  I am tweaking my wardrobe a bit too, getting rid of more work clothes.  I have decided that quality stuff that is warm and useful that I might want when I am older, if I cannot sell it, I will store 2 boxes under the bed.  This is all the clothes storing I will allow myself!I have steadily had a few sales, I am making a second pass at the house and taking more to RH.  Plan to get city house down to bare bones.  We have 4 more pieces of furniture (sideboard cubby, antique chest of drawers, antique secretary and one filing cabinet) maybe couple more to move before we stage our house.  Then we will only have 5 bookcases to move after our house sells, a couple of chairs, an armoire, a bakers rack and a file cabinet.  We are going to try to stretch this out over next 3 months.  Then we will have gotten our money out of an older suburban we bought, that we had to put a bit more money into than we expected.  As I start to feel the overwhelmed list, I think about looking at the new beginning, not the old ending.  There is more power in looking for the good in the possibilities, not the past.  I am now convinced I am going to sell my more expensive SUV and go without a 4th car, or trade it for a small truck.  We may not have luck selling outright, so we will try that first and then trade if nec.We do still have a lot of hunting and camping gear, but now that we have pretty much decided I am retiring with him this fall, we might need it and figure that will be a good time to weed that out.  So much for no-buy January, I got an awesome deal on a brand new pair of leather Columbia hiking boots on PM for $55!  My DH found a good deal on a pair that he had been wanting for several years - Vasque.  So, I don't feel bad because they really are more of a necessity than the normal clothes we buy.  I just dream about those hikes we want to take in retirement state.  I think about that everytime i have to bundle up and walk my dogs here in city.  RH has a fenced backyard and doggie door!  Can't wait!  Have a wonderful week!"},

{"title": "In and Out of My Comfort Zone", "date": "Wednesday, December 27, 2017", "text": "I work 4 ten hour days the week after a Monday holiday off.  Yesterday I worked 10 hours and then went home and changed and went to a new to me yoga class.  Well, that is after DH and I cleaned several areas where our older male dog had had...er, difficulties with his daily routine...I had noticed Sunday he was having issues when I walked him couple of times, but did not notice the last time I walked him.  Poor guy.  Hope he is ok today.  Well, the yoga instructor must be a doctor or physical therapist.  He was really good at vocalizing ways to focus our poses.  It was a great class!  I am feeling it today, but that is a good sign.  When I walked in and put my matt down and was doing a bit of stretching, he asked me if I had done \"ashtanga\" before.  I just looked at him for a second and said \"I am really not sure, not sure I know what that means\".  Haha.  A woman I recognized from another class said, she was sure I had, as she had seen me in other classes with her.  Well, if I had, I had not much.  But I can see where Ashtanga should be a part of my normal practice.  Wiki defines it as:  \"Ashtanga means eight limbs or branches, of which asana or physical yoga posture is merely one branch, breath or pranayama is another.\"  Basically, he had us hold each position for several seconds, to really focus on all the aspects of each joint/muscle being used and direct our energy there.  The breathing was so natural, it just came with the poses.  He made us do some unusual poses, like to ball up or really open up the chest and continue to make tiny adjustments to be able to breathe in a long inhalation and thus a long exhalation.  He said part of yoga is finding the breath, even when it seems you are too constricted (i.e. backbent or constricted in a ball) and focus on moving your belly butten toward the backbone to get used to breathing when it is hard.  He kept us for an hour and a half!  Oh, well, it was good!I think everyone should try yoga on some level.  I wish I had started when I was a kid.  Have a great hump day, everyone!"},
{"title": "Expectations", "date": "Tuesday, December 26, 2017", "text": "A blogger whose blog I read wrote last week about putting pressure on herself and then not meeting expectations.  I related a lot to that.  We spend, spend, spend (time, efforts, resources, money) up to the crazy holidays, then I feel guilty and restless when I just sit still and then the day after expect my checkbook, my weight and my gastrointestinal system to be at normal.  Not so fast!  Then, add in some advertisements about sales, some social media posts where people's outsides don't look like my insides...YIKES.  Let me off the treadmill!  At least now that I am in middle age, I am a little more seasoned in my perspective.  But I do really feel for people who are young and naïve going through this time.  I used to absolutely mourn post Christmas.  Now I LOVE it.  I still do sort of expect a little too much from myself, but I just remember that today is just for today.  Yesterday is over and tomorrow is not guaranteed.  Just enjoy...and put one foot in front of the other.Cold, snowy and gray today.  Back to work.  Back to sitting and having too much time to think and less distractions.  But I am happy, because my perspective is getting much better with age - just like good leather and wood.  I don't say wine, because I do not drink."},

{"title": "End of year golas/budget", "date": "Wednesday, December 20, 2017", "text": "End of year goals/budgetI am funding my Roth for 2017, so that feels good. I should have saved a lot more...I wish we would have decided to retire in 2018 earlier this year...maybe i would have saved more!  For now, I am working on living in the moment and enjoying all my city and CH has to offer.  This is my last winter this far north (not that I am that far north - just the farthest north I have ever lived).  Tomorrow is the shortest day of the year, winter solstice.  Then the days start to lengthen again.  Hallelujah!I got on one  yoga class so far and I am doing another tonight.  I will either walk Fri or Sat and then I will have at least moved around 3 times this week!  I just go to work and was thinking of how this time last year I was going through a lot of tests still.  My specialist finally diagnosed me with IBD.  Inflammatory bowel disease.  I am doing ok, but I ate a piece of home made bread late and woke up twice coughing and gagging from acid in my  throat, so I will never do that again.  I had my typical protein smoothie last night around 6:30, but I will still hungry so I ate a piece of bread.  I had to get up and take about 6 tums during the night.  This week I was trying intermittent fasting to give my system a break and to avoid overeating.  Essentially I have been skipping breakfast and then eating a good lunch and maybe another snack in afternoon and then my smoothie evenings.  Well, I think I can do this better if I keep busy.  But my job is so boring and tedious, it is harder than weekends when I am busy.  I just sit here at my desk and think about what I can eat!Today, my actual employer is coming to town to bring us lunch.  There are a few of us here at this location, we are all temps.  We work AT a big business, but we actually work FOR a firm that places us here.  We are excited to see what they bring.  Last year it was pizza (2 of us cannot have dairy) and year before that it was Italian (I can usu have salad and chicken and make it work) and year before that it was bagels and cream cheese.  More about year end.  I do not have any paid time off as a temp.  So, a couple years in I started my own vacation fund.  I have been supplementing this fund with proceeds from stuff I sell.  I have made it a point and shown my husband that stuff that had meaning to him that he has sold I have put into this fund and have used it to make improvements/buy appliances for our RH.  This past summer we took out an unvented fireplace and put in a giant picture window looking out over our back patio and back yard.  I did 200 hours of overtime and bought a new range, (will buy) a range hood, and dishwasher.  I also bought my anniversary bands out of this.  I have enough left to fund my Roth and pay for the tile work we will have in our master shower (the contractor says February - my fingers are crossed, I have had the tile sitting in my garage for over 2 years).  I also started a tax fund and I fund it 75-100 every week.  I just paid all our pers prop taxes in RH (we moved couple cars/motorcycles down there 2 years ago - rate is much cheaper than city we work in).  And last week I paid city pers prop on the single car we have registered here in city.  I will keep funding this same fund until March, then I should have enough for pers prop in retirement town for vehicles and for our real estate.  Once we move (I am calling them in January), we will get our $350 homestead tax credit back.  Once DH turns 65, our real estate taxes will be locked in and never increase.  We will not miss the following about city we work in:  taxes!  They are really high here.  Our family in retirement town figured their taxes were bad until I researched it and learned that our real estate taxes are almost double and our pers prop taxes are 3 times higher in the city than in the retirement town!  So we moved 3 cars (we have 4) and our motorcycles to retirement town and saved approx. $3k.  We will not miss the commute - we live on the other side of the river from this city.  We have to cross the river twice a day.  When there are accidents, it is horrible.  When it snows, it is horrible.  When it rains, it is horrible.  We will not miss living in a patio home where we have $200/month (not quite, but is going up now to $190!) HOA fees.  We will not miss having to bundle up, put our yapping dogs on leashes and walk them outside 3 times a day.  We will not miss the stairs in our house.  We have a basement and we have 3 steps down to the garage - I told my husband the other day, you know you are getting old when 3 stairs down in the morning is considered a hassle.  HAHA.  We will not miss the main living area of our house (living room/master bed room) being on the southwest (hottest) side of the house.  We will not miss our front steps being in the shadows on the north side (when it snows our ices - these steps take forever to thaw, making it treacherous to walk on them).  We will not miss paying $90/month for parking - my husband.  I park 2 blocks away, saving myself the $100/month parking where I work.  In March, I will have been here 10 years.  If I paid 100/month for 10 years, that would equal = $12,000!  I have literally saved $12,000 by walking 2 blocks from free public parking.  But I have fallen down on snowing sidewalks/parking lots, I fell once in the rain this summer and I avoid all morning appointments if possible, because I don't know if I will be able to find parking.  We will also not miss our jobs.  DH has been in his position 20 years, works to help indigents and the disadvantaged.  So, that part is good, but there are really negative/sad aspects to what he has to see and is exposed to and I know he will not miss that.  The entire system is so broken...well, that is a whole other topic.  And, it is not my story to tell.  It is his and his co workers.  People who do what they do, not because they wanted a cushy government job to lounge, but because what they do is critical to our system of justice.  My job, well...I had burnout pretty early in my career...more on that another time.  But my current gig is very boring, the pay is not great, I have no benefits, I have not had a performance review in 10 years and we are either sitting still doing very little bored out of our minds are we are on multiple projects, everything is a crises, we are expected to jump in and \"figure it out ourselves\" while being yelled at and talked down to like we are 5 years old.  The main guy who has been here at this firm all the years I have been here is good to us, respectful and really does try to take care of us and keep us on projects as people come and go.  Over ten years I have been part of a core group of about 25 who have been here 8 - 12 years.  We have had projects come and seen 50-100 people hired and we have seen most of those people let go.  Summers can get slow, but for sure, in this industry things slow to a crawl at Christmas/year end time.  There were years I was very nervous if I would be let go at this time of year.  Some of my long time co workers have been let go for a couple of days, to a couple of years, only to be brought back as projects dictated.  The partners at this firm are wonderful, nice and gracious, giving us praise and credit for our hard work.  Also, the associates, senior project managers and paralegals are nice.  The people I work with on a day to day basis who have awful are 1)  paralegals, 2)  junior project managers and 3)  staff attorneys.  I don't know if it is just because these newer in their careers people are just so stressed and busy, they are short tempered and under pressure and take it out on us or if they resent us because we are just \"temps\" and we get paid as much or more than they do and we can leave at 11 on Fridays.  Sometimes we hear this in a \"joking\" way when we are leaving at 11 and I always reply the same way...\"I will trade you my uncertain temporary position with no benefits and Fridays off at 11 for your salaried position with vacation and sick days\".  They just smile and waive.  Today, I try to focus on the things I love about my working city:  There are lots of wonderful people here, Midwest people are very polite and welcoming and love their sports and their food and their guns and their heroes (sports, political, religious and historical).  This city is a city with a rich tradition of history and commerce.  There is a  big sense of \"community\" here.  I lived for a time out west and the people there were mostly transplants and really lacked this sense of pride and community.  My city has a lot of arts and attractions to see, lots of great shopping and restaurants.  We can go to all the concerts and live music we can find time and money for.  We have a lot of family here.  DH 2 brothers and my 2 maternal aunts and their families and my paternal aunt and her family.  My dear grandmother (DGM) lives here.  I honestly cannot yet comprehend how we are going to be separated...I just have to avoid thinking of it, really.  Last time I was at her apartment, we were going through and arranging some of her santas.  I asked her where her cute little scarecrow for her door was...she said \"I threw it away\".  I usu take her seasonal stuff home or store it up high in her closet.  I asked what about next fall?  She said \"I will be dead by then...\"  Then she laughed and said \"I hope\".  This is not the first time we have had this type of conversation, we talk about death pretty freely.  I feel like if I make it to 98, I hope I have someone I can talk about death with.  More on that later too.  Have a great mid week.  We are leading in to the Christmas weekend.  Enjoy your family and friends.  Hug people because they need it, not just you.  Do a random act of kindness.  Budget in a donation to a charity, it will make you feel every bit as good and a useless trinket you buy for yourself or someone else that will just end up in a landfill.  Enjoy the moments...I am working on that too.  Thanks for stopping by!"},
{"title": "Midday Monday", "date": "Monday, December 18, 2017", "text": "I will prob play catch up from being so lazy yesterday, so close to Christmas.  Oh well.  I am still going to try to get in 2, maybe even 3 yoga sessions since I did not walk yesterday.  It was cool and windy/drizzley most of the day but when I walked my dogs at 4:15 I realized it was dry enough I prob could have gotten in a walk - darn!  Oh well, it feels good to ease off just a bit.  Until I can't fit into my carefully cultivated wardrobe!  Ha.So, today I am ticking off a check list of all the stuff I have to do 1)  before we go to RH/state for Christmas, 2)  what I will accomplish before we come back to the city and 3)  prepare for Christmas Eve and Day in the city.  That means, I will have to buy couple more grocery items before we leave so that I will have plenty of time to unload the car, take a walk and get ready for 5pm chuch when we get home (after 4 hour drive) Sunday!  Oh well, life is good - too much family/friends/activities and food...will be like a blur when we look back in cold/quiet January.  I always have liked that part of the year as I have gotten older - quiet January.  I time of really backing off and being quiet and intentional.  I wonder if this transition feeling will change next year when we are retired/semi retired?So today I mailed off a large poncho I got a few years ago at a festival.  My friend remarked about the sizeable box I carried (we park and walk in together most mornings - 2 blocks in the cold/dark morning).  I explained that I no longer give in to the thought of buying an object that basically serves one purpose.  A poncho.  A blanket is a blanket and can be a poncho too.  But a poncho is just a poncho.  So, gone!  Out the door.  I did not sell anything else, but I am not surprised - only a week out from Christmas.  At this point, I have been selling on PM for exactly one year.  I remember last year it was quiet right before Christmas but surprisingly busy very soon after - all seemed like it was all through January.  People are spending Christmas cash I guess.  So, I have pretty much decided that I am going to continue through Jan and then wind down.  It takes a lot of activity to get stuff seen/sold/packaged/mailed on any forum - but especially lately.  Last year it seemed to happen much more easily, now I have to share/share/share and list/list/list...just getting tired of it.  I have decided that good quality clothes that are useful...I will store in plastic totes under guest room bed - that is ALL I will store!  The rest will fit in master closet/dressers and overflow/dressy/seasonal in larger guest room.  Anything more than that - we DO NOT NEED!  The smaller guest room will be used for craft/office closet.  It is a tiny walk-in that has shelves that cover 2 walls (and 3rd wall up high - that I put in).  I will store little used fabric up high and down low I will literally make an office \"desk\" and I am going to take the doors off and store them in the attic.  The room also has built in drawers that hold craft stuff and I put in a sleeper sofa and a chair.  I plan to use that room for company overflow and for a sitting room if one of us wants to sit and watch a different TV show, or read and just have a bit of privacy.  It is small!  But cozy.Other than that - not much frugal/projects/clearing out got done this past weekend, but it felt great to sit and relax all afternoon.  Have a great Monday!"},

{"title": "RIP Rusty", "date": "Monday, December 11, 2017", "text": "My DIL (dear in laws) dachshund, Rusty, has been sick all summer with allergy type symptoms.  He has deteriorated this fall, having anemia and pain/lethargy.  He even had a transfusion.  He died Sat morning.  He was only like 7.  I know how attached to him my FIL in particular was to Rusty.  Sweet dear Rusty, cross the rainbow bridge and be free of pain and run again in the field with Barney and all the other dogs.  You did your job well here on earth.  We love you and we will miss you.It has been so sweet to see how much my DH and his brothers and sister love and worry for the pain they know this has caused their parents.  So, right away the 3 brothers began telling their father he should get another dog, if not puppy.  FIL did not say no and did not really say yes.  This was while Rusty was still sick and deteriorating.  The kids did not want to be too pushy or rush things, but they were very concerned because of how close FIL was with Rusty.  So, the search began and a pup was found a couple weeks ago.  A picture was texted to SIL and she showed her phone to her parents.  They agreed the pup was cute.  The pup was obtained by DH brother and his wife.  They were not supposed to get him for another week, but once Rusty passed they agreed to let him go a week early.  We went over to meet \"Buddy\" Friday after work, before they took him to DIL home in nearby state (in same town as our RH).  The report was that Buddy was very much loved and readily accepted and was the perfect antidote for idle hands and idle heart.  He even woke them up the next morning 5am sharp needing outside to potty.  DH can tell by his parents' voices they are pleased with Buddy.  So sweet.  DH and I have 2 dogs and a cat.  We are trying to find a home for the 11 y/o cat.  Our other cat was elderly and passed this summer and the kitty is lonely.  My female Chihuahua does not like the kitty and barks at her.  The kitty instigates it because she is needy.  it is not an ideal situation.  My male Chihuahua is about 11 years old and has a hear murmur, so we worry about him.  As he was beginning to slow down about 3 years ago, my DH told me we should get another and he was instrumental in making us go look.  When I walked in, DH really was drawn to the big dogs, be we know that our small male is not crazy about bigger dogs.  He went and looked at each big dog and I really struggled.  I encouraged him to go and look in the small dog room.  We walked in and the door opened right to left.  I was on left side, DH was on my right.  When the door opened up, it partially blocked the pens to our left.  I looked left and DH looked right.  When I saw little C, she nervously approached the cage and quickly licked my hand and then ran back to the back of the pen and was withdrawn and cringing, she was so nervous.  By the time I got DH attention, she was in the corner, refusing to look at us or come over to us.  I told him what she had done and told him I had a feeling about her.  DH was not too impressed.  The staff had us take her outside and we sat around (we brought our boy CO to meet her to be sure they would be compatible).  CI was so nervous, that she just stuck to the staff and would not come to us, even for hot dog bite.  Then I showed her a toy and she was interested, but still would not come to me.  Then I sat down and she crawled into my lap.  That is all it took!  We brought her home and we have had her now for 2.5 years.  She is my delight and so runs our entire household.  Animals bring so much joy into our life.  I feel they are a gift from God for sure!"},

She had gotten in a heated argument with her male friend and found herself in some trouble.  I helped her through that.  Then my DGM got sick and went into hospital and spent her 98th and my 50th birthday there.  She went to rehab mid March and finally home late April.  Late June I did overtime until October.  July I learned another childhood friend was having some mental instability and has been in the psychiatric hospital twice.  All my classmates turned 50 this year with me, we had a lunch at my house in Aug.  I went to the lake to celebrate my cousins 50th birthday.  I have watched a relative (PA) move and two others have cancer tx (MA2 and cousin S).  Another (BIL) learn he has slow cancer that does not require tx and have seen my SIL and her husband deal with his moms death and hourding for nearly a year.  I have seen a relative have substance abuse issues, another 2 have financial problems, I have seen cousins struggle to care for elderly parents, deal with abuse issues (a revelation revealed to me at a wedding) and I have received 2 baby shower invites (bought for 1 so far).  I have bought about 6 graduation gifts this year, given several monetary donations for animals and natural disaster victims and felt sad with the rest of the country as the hurricaines and wildfires raged this year.  While I happily received 2 wedding invites for next spring, i was sad to learn a relative is divorcing after one year and another relative is struggling with their marriage.  Finally, i have stood by helplessly and watched my dear neighbors while they watch their 49 yo daughter slip away from colon cancer.  At this point, her pain is so bad, I dont know what to pray for, except for God to comfort her and her family.Current events are crazy, the entire world seems full of anger and hate.  But I have about as good a life now as I have ever had.  I have a wonderful husband, I have a great yoga class I love, a great group of friends and I have a job  and a roof over my head.  I do feel really overwhelmed at times with so much going on around me.  Now more than ever, I am making a daily effort to have daily contact with God.  I have been going back to church regularly and I know I have a God that looks over me."},
{"title": "Monday Start Over", "date": "Monday, December 4, 2017", "text": "I worked 60 hours last weekend.  I did not get enough of a break this weekend, skipped church to rest and get stuff done at home.  I did feel OK later Sat (just skipped lunch).  Went to dinner and a program with a couple of good girl friends.  DH stayed home.  I could tell he was missing me, texted me sev times when he was off and playing golf with his brother Friday and then I worked all day and did not get home till 9 Sat.  We spent Sun together.  I cooked and cleaned, the house was neglected after Thanksgiving being gone and then working so much last week.  Laundry.We did get our bikes winterized.  I filled mine with gas and left it in driveway while he cleaned out corner of garage to fit them in enough to be able to bring his car in for winter, so its not iced in the mornings when he goes to work.  I always have mine fit in, on left side.  Plus, my car is an expensive new car, so we try to take really good care of it.  I had planned to sell mine next year if I can't find work in my new state.  The more I think about it, the more I think I will just plan to sell it regardless.  We could use the extra savings.  It is sort of stressful having a nice car, lots of hazards and people seem to just slam their doors into it and it just kills me.  It is starting to own me.When we rode to get gas, just a couple of miles we saw about 10 bikes.  Everyone enjoying the mild weather before it drops to 20's tonight!  I hurried and did a nice walk yesterday while hubby put the bikes in garage, put gas additive in the tank and put them on trickle chargers.  Today I am SORE and have a head ache!  Stomach is better, but not great.  I am not optimal for a Monday, but I have decided I am going to hit \"restart\".  I will decide how this week goes!  And it is going to be great, even if I am a little tired!  I heard a saying this morning that inspired me.  \"Life is short, but it's also wide\".  After all, I have a great DH, food cooked in the kitchen, toys winterized, hot yoga and super moon tonight (I thought it was yesterday), an overtime paycheck coming, great friends, dogs I love...life is good!  Have a great Monday!What I did to simpliy this past weekend:  cleaned lower cabinets and cleared out corner of garage (DH did), we got rid of a huge Rubbermaid storage thing w/no lid, I sold a pair of shoes and a purse and I am giving away a vest (maybe).  I also cleaned out a bunch of pottery off the tops of my cabinets and cleaned out basement linen closet and stuff stored in the basement bathroom vanity.  It's not much, but it is something.  I have pretty much gathered the next load to take to RH in 2 weeks."},

{"title": "Thirsty Thursday", "date": "Friday, December 1, 2017", "text": "This is from yesterday ..I feel restless today.  Not sure why.  Maybe because I am in limbo on a few things and my ability to control stuff is compromised.  I am still making progress toward the goal post, but I need to be grateful in the moment.  Not just put it out there for a few days around Thanksgiving and then move on full speed to unbridled Christmas.  Although, now that I am really not into Christmas, so that might give reason for my malaise.  I am back on overtime, but just for a couple of weeks.  Yet, it intrudes into my housekeeping and workout and that affects my anxiety a little.  I have a couple of other projects I have to abandon too, so there is the shuffling and my DG does not get the attention she deserves.  I will just try to focus on the positives, remember it is temporary and think of the extra cash!  I will just have to do a little more after work in the evenings and try to focus my workouts on Sun/Mon night yoga.  When I was working OT this summer, it wasn't so bad because it does not get dark until 9-9:30.  Now that it gets dark at 5:30, I am ready to go home and crawl into bed.  I haven't sold anything despite listing a lot more since Sunday.  But the real progress is that I have found several more things to list.  It really is like a floodgate, once you tap into that feeling, stuff just becomes so easy to let go of.  Crazy!"},
{"title": "Wardrobe Capsule (not quite) Goals", "date": "Tuesday, November 28, 2017", "text": "I have not slept well since last Wed.  What is up with that?This year I have redone my wardrobe.  I have been doing this a little for the past 10 years as my job has become more casual and since I let my hair go gray.  2017 is the most money that I will ever spend on clothes/shoes/accessories in a single year again.  For sure shoes/accessories.  My clothes purchases were not too bad.  I am sure I have spent more when I was just shopping for fun and with no plan.  I had so much chaos.  I have always been a shopper and just bough stuff on a whim or because it was on sale.  But now I am downsizing fairly effectively.  Other than couple strategic purpose (coat/workout/golf) I don't plan to buy much for a long time.  I won't ever shop like I used to.  I now focus on classic pieces and not trends.  My accessories and shoes purchases this year were high, because I totally revamped both my purse/wallets and shoe wardrobe.  I also bought a pair of diamond anniversary bands that I have wanted for several years.  I do a lot of painting/yard/gardinging at RH, that I don't want to wear my diamond ring when i am wearing gardening or motorcycle gloves.  I sold off a bunch of my shoes (boots, really) and bought 2 more very nice pair that should just about last the rest of my life.  One last year and one this year.  The savings in space is huge!  I also got rid of about 8 various tote bags, all cheap and some falling apart for one really nice vintage leather overnight bag, 1 vintage work tote, 1 vintage leather tote for workout clothes for my trunk and 1 no name leather all purpose tote.  I realize this past year I have spent a lot of time and energy and focus on doing this wardrobe overhall, but I have been strategic and planned, bought smart and second-hand when I could and feel that now I can pretty much just maintain my wardrobe going forward.  No more time/money/desire to shop aimlessly.  I want to focus on more important things - like helping my husband pare down his closet and getting all our stuff moved and organized in our new, smaller RH.  P.S.  I have sold about $10k of stuff in the past 2 years paring down furniture, hunting accessories, boots, purses, jewelry, motorcycle gear, sporting goods, coats, kitchenware, seasonal decorations, misc furnishings/antiques and 2 sets of dishes.  Overall, I feel like this is a huge win and an absolute necessity for us to be able to fit comfortably and without a bunch of clutter in our new place.  Since I have had 2 years to do it, it was easier.  I would do it all over again.  Even though it was a lot of work, it felt good purging.  My DH thinks selling stuff is my new hobby, but I would much rather have a less cluttered space that is easier to clean and maintain and find time to get back to reading!  My sales proceeds have gone into replacement pieces, doing remodeling at RH and savings.  I have funded most of my wardrobe overhaul in cash/some sales proceeds.  I will likely not make the same income again for a couple years, so this has worked out well.Here are my breakdowns of what I bought in 2017, so far.  I still have about $500 I expect in clothes sales and I am also trying to sell a custom piece of jewelry I have listed for $1100.  So we shall see how that shakes down.  I certainly do not think I will have to do such a pare down ever again.  (Sure does give me incentive to stay same size!).  The next time I pare down, it will be pretty much to get rid of the last of my professional work clothes/shoes/bags.  I have about 6 pair of shoes left that are for work and I can prob get rid of about half of those.  I will keep one pair of black pumps and one nude.  I will get ride of 2 more purses and 1 tote bag.  It will be exciting to purge last of my suits/slacks/dresses and just keep the fun stuff.  I am really into stuff that can double duty casual or be paired with jackets/shoes/accessories and dressed up if i need.  I have bought 4 dresses in the past 2 years, but i like to have them for church/weddings/graduations.  Over the last 10 years as I have been strictly a temp, I have probably gotten rid of 15 pair of heels, about 10 suits, 4 dressy coats and 3 briefcases.  I also got rid of about 20 pair of boots and numerous business separates and several dresses that were too young/specific.  One thing i have done to try to help myself pare down, now that i have gray hair, i don't wear brown anymore, so that was about 1/3 of my wardrobe.  I also find that as much as i love navy, it is dressier than i want to be now, so i got rid of a bunch of navy stuff.  Now I am way more focused when I do shop and don't buy anything but black, gray or denim.  I buy a few colorful accessories (scarves and costume jewelry that are easy to change out).  I figure i won't keep much costume jewelry at all either, once i am not working.  Jewelry and accessories do not take up nearly as much space, but they are still clutter if they start to take over.  Looking back I am sad that I was such a hoarder, but glad I have felt this shift.total $2159 (less 1000 rings = $1159)   clothes:  409   shoes:  467   accessories:  1283PM & Thred up   clothes:  59 (misc, incl 2 pair white jeans -

{"title": "Post Thanksgiving", "date": "Monday, November 27, 2017", "text": "I just love Thanksgiving, because it is all about getting with family and thinking of our blessings.  It is not as stressful and the expectations as high as Christmas.  I seem to have more conflicted memories and sadness associated with Christmas, mostly because of the people who I miss who have passed before me and because I am sad that I don't have children.  I would have made an awesome grandma.We had a great Thanksgiving.  We went to the facility where my grandmother (DG) lives and had a lovely lunch with her and my aunt (PA).  Then we drove to our retirement house (RH) and got there about 6:30 and unloaded the car and went and said hello to DH parents.  We went to football game the next day with my sister, it was so much fun!  Then Sat we hung out with DH family.  There are not a lot of children in DH family, just 2 nieces and 2 nephews.  The 2 nieces were there, so that was fun spending time with some young people.  We had too much food and so many laughs.  We took some photos.  We had a great time.  I am so lucky to have married into such a wonderful family.  I hope you are having a wonderful Cyber Monday.  The only things I bought for black Friday and Cyber Monday were things I needed for the house (a Pampered Chef order and literally a Walmart supplies order).  I have mostly finished what limited shopping I do for the holidays.  My DH retirement gift I bought him we agreed no more Christmas gifts for a few years!  I did pick out pieces of estate jewelry (more on that later).  I brought home a few leather pieces from my Sister In Law's MIL estate to help sell on line.  I sold a couple more things and so that is good to get anything moved out.  That's about all for today!"},

{"title": "Looking for Love is Like Gambling", "date": "Wednesday, November 22, 2017", "text": "16 years ago I moved home to the Midwestern city I was born in, from the Southwest.  I had lived in a large Southwestern city for 3 years with my job.  I liked it there quite a bit, but I was struggling in a few areas of my personal life and so I needed a change.  Part of my motivation was to take the focus off my career and meet someone, get married and have kids.  I did not want to meet a person from the another state out West and then never have a chance to make the move back to the Midwest.  So, I was essentially on a quest to meet a husband and have a baby.  I moved back and stayed focused on my career long enough to get established and buy a house.  My job was going well and I got a promotion.  Then I started looking to meet someone about 9 months later.  I had a lot of family back here, so I met people through them.  That was really different from the other 3 cities I had lived in where I had no family.  I really liked the feeling that my family was there and loved get togethers and holidays.  I had a lot of fun with my cousins and my aunts.  I met people everyewhere I went, I was so excited to be home where I had roots as a child and my parents had roots and their parents.  Even though my mom was gone and my dad lived 3 hours south, I felt like I was home.  This was still sort of early internet, pre Myspace and pre Facebook, at least.  The online thing felt weird.  Like people put their best foot forward and kept other parts of themselves hidden.  It felt like it was not authentic.  So, I decided I would have to meet someone the old fashioned way.  One night while I was studying for a huge test, I took a break and went to a concert with my cousins.  This was late July.  I met a man who was my cousins' friend.  He was very nice and funny.  He sort of followed me around that night and I did not mind.  He was very sweet to me and he was funny.  I could tell my cousins and their friends liked him a lot.  I ended up being the designated driver and drove my cousins, their friends and this guy home, in his large Lincoln sedan.  I had never driven a car that big.  It was fun.  We had all the windows rolled down and we sang songs at the top of our lungs.  Eventually I agreed to go out with this guy and he took me to an amusement park.  This would have been early August.  We had a great time and I enjoyed his attention.  We dated the rest of the summer and I met his kids in late September or early August.  His kids were adorable.  I loved the way he was with his kids.  He loved them so much, it was so sweet.  He was a really great dad.  His kids were really sweet and polite and were very sweet to me too.  We got serious, mostly, things were fun.  There were warning signs, but I ignored them.  Part of me felt like this was my last chance to have a family of my own.  Part of me felt that I had given up too easily in past relationships and become a \"runner\".  I really wanted to try to make a relationship work.  I should have listened to my conscience and bailed.  Things went very, very wrong and took me down a really dark and horrible path.  I should have folded.  I tried to fold many times, knowing that I did not have a good hand.  But he convinced me to stay or my own conflicted feelings prevented me from getting out of the situation that I knew was not good for me.  I loved his kids and I loved his parents.  He had a business.  He was stable financially.  What I did not know was that there were a lot of secrets kept from me.  Some of meeting a person and building a life are timing and luck, sort of like playing poker.  But there are also ways we can increase our odds and part of increasing our odds are knowing when we should fold.  I should have folded, put my cards down and ran.  But I just continued to ante up.  How could I have known he was keeping so much from me.  Did I know deep down.  The signs were there.  Why did I stay?"},

Funny this is the prayer this morning.The weekend was pretty busy...I need a weekend of nothing but rest.  So maybe the 1st weekend of Dec I will do that.  Have a total pajama day Sat!  Part of the problems i have are cyclical...i start feeling really good, I eat too much or not enough good \"whole\" foods, i.e. too much processed junk/sugar and then I crash and burn.  I went to bed feeling pretty bad last night.  My tummy was really upset, some abdominal and upper acid reflux and my joints were sore, right knee was throbbing.  Also some things I don't mention in a blog telling me my Candida might be back.  I know I need to do elimination diet...but it is the week of Thanksgiving...really?!  Oh well, I will just focus on lean meat and veggies this week...try to give up sugar.  It is hard, but feeling like this is harder.  I did a 2 hour yoga class yesterday.  it was not solid 2 hours of flow, it was focused on using props (blocks and straps...and even the wall) to reshift your practice to sharpen up your poses.  Not just push for the ultimate twist so you can say \"I did it\", but really think about aligning the spine and opening the shoulders and gain from the stretch.  I liked it.  I would have never followed through with it, but I signed up and paid for it last week!  I ran home from church, put 2 home made pizzas (dairy free) in the oven and told my husband to take them out...then ran to the yoga class.  I was too tired to walk.  I really prefer to walk if I can, esp in the winter on weekends, because I like the sunshine.  I can't get home early enough during the week to walk in the daylight.  so far rest last evening helped my knee, so i am planning on hot yoga after work.  We shall see.  Hope you get some sun on your face today and don't get overwhelmed by stuff!"},

Whether used as a guiding light for those dressed in camouflage, or simply as a beautiful moon to reflect on, on the night that Daylight Savings Time ends, I love it.Today I got up and moved some ornamental grass to each side of the driveway from a couple of planters since it had grown so big and was drying out too much.  Then I planted a catalpa tree and a fig tree given to me by 2 of my work friends.  Now I am off to do some trimming on a way overgrown wisteria and move some rocks fir some future landscaping.  Have a productive Saturday!Moon, daylight savings, ornamental grass, catalpa tree, fig tree, wisteria, rocks11/2/17Giggles rememberedDuring our recent family weekend, my sister D3 told us a story...her husband helped her cook recently and commented on how hard she worked to feed him and the kids over the years...she replied \"yeah, I did\".  Hehe, this made all us women giggle."},
{"title": "All Souls Day", "date": "Wednesday, November 1, 2017", "text": "11/1/17I dedicate my post today to my mom, God rest her soul.I cannot even believe that it is already November.  It is cool and gray outside, but not as cold and windy as Halloween.  I did manage to bundle up and take a walk after work.  Next week ends daylight savings time, so will be too dark for me to walk after this week.  I will still walk on Sundays though.  I do not walk in the dark.  I live in a nice suburb of a large Midwestern city and probably would be safe walking even in the pitch black, but my husband and I just do not think this is a good idea, so I avoid it.  My husband walks with me sometimes, but I cannot depend on him to walk with me.  So, I guess I will increase my yoga to twice a week and walk weekends.  I have walked regularly since I graduated from high school in the 80's.  I used to do it just to keep my weight down, but over the years the benefits have become so obvious, that I do it to stay active and healthy.  Perhaps more important even still are the benefits it has on my psyche.  I feel better mentally and my mind shifts into a relaxation mode when I walk regularly.  I listen to podcasts, books or music and I just really enjoy it.  I have a beautiful walking area on a parkway at my CH (city home).  It goes in between 2 golf courses and so I find balls all the time and it is also in between to cow pastures so we see lots of wild animals, along with the cows.  There is a stream and a pond that is a constant source of animals.  We have seen (or heard) owls, an eagle, hawks, ducks, geese, kingfishers, egrets, cormorants, coots, herons, cranes, bitterns, all manner of other migratory birds, foxes, coyotes, raccoons, beavers, otters, muskrats, possums, skunks, deer, turtles, frogs and...I think that about covers it.  I hope it stays nice enough today to walk again when I get home.  Last night after my walk we pretty much lay low while the kids trick or treated, we have 2 small dogs that go crazy, so we don't turn our light on.  I hate it, but I feel like our neighbors would be disturbed by the barking because we are the middle unit in a patio home.  Then, we both wanted to watch different shows, so my husband ate his fish meal in front of the TV in the living room and I enjoyed my pumpkin smoothie in the bed room.  We hardly ever do that, but I enjoyed catching up on one of my shows.  I think tonight I will fix him either left over pancakes from Sunday morning or a taco salad.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot...yesterday was the last day of overtime for me!  I have been on overtime since June and I am tired of it.  I added it all up and I have done an extra 182 hours of overtime and I am ready to wind down a little.  Next week I have a colonoscopy on Monday and I have decided to just take the rest of the day off!  That is a rare thing for sure.  It will be sort of like a reward.  I am going to eat lunch with my aunts and then putter at home.  I dread it so much, I just want to get it over with.  I have had like 8 in the past 5 years, but I am doing a lot better between diet, medicine and supplements.  And I just have to accept that I need a lot of rest, esp while I am working full time.  My stress over the years has been reduced since I changed careers and I hope to downsize the stress even more when my husband retires.  Stress is a killer when you have a constant medical condition like I do.  Have a great Wednesday, I hope you get to enjoy what ever thing reduces your stress and gives you some joy!November, yoga, exercise, golf balls, birds, animals, nature, dogs, CH walking, health, career, stress"},

{"title": "Monday Remind Me Again", "date": "Monday, October 30, 2017", "text": "10/30/17Monday Remind Me AgainThis morning I am tired and it is cold and gray outside.  I was in a foul mood yesterday, but could not really put my finger on why except really, I allowed myself to focus on the negative.  Stupid petty negative.  Several things I worked on this weekend did not work out like I hoped, I was too busy and doing several things for other people, not what I wanted to do and Sunday I could not get my DGM books to balance and then more on this in a minute.  While my DGM was down at lunch, I got there early to work on her book keeping.  I hate book keeping, esp if it is not my own books.  I think I was hurrying, getting ready for her company and I just did not understand her savings book scribbles, so I postponed finishing the bottom line till she and I have quiet time to work on it together.  About 1:15 her nephew brought his mother over.  My DGM cannot see or hear hardly at all, so she insists on me or her daughter (PA) being there when she has company.  She is uncomfortable trying to make conversation now and appreciates our keeping the flow going.  I was really glad to see my Great Aunt and give her a couple hugs/kisses and I was even glad to see her son, R.  I find him friendly and easy to talk to.  He is quite funny and I enjoy him very much.  He is my dad's 1st cousin and they were both fond of each other.  Much of the visit included fond memories and misty eyed musings of R. It got awkward when he asked about my half brother.  My DGM at 98, stepped in and carried this part of the conversation.  I just sat awkwardly and felt all my unease and discomfort from 2012 to 2014 come rushing back.  I just stated simply and truthfully that I did not get along with half brother's mom and I don't hear from half brother.  We finished the afternoon with nice conversation and focus on DGM and her SIL, my great aunt.  It ended pleasantly enough, I visited with my DGM a few minutes, then I drove 30 miles home.I was in a horrid mood.  I still have a lot of bewilderment about what happened and why.  I stopped to visit with my aunts' briefly (my mom's sisters) it was a good interlude because when I got home to my DH, I was no longer in such a foul mood.  Maybe last night, sleeping on it let it process the way it was supposed to.  This morning, I feel ok.  I questioned whether my discomfort was felt by my DGM or her company.  I had a lot of self doubt.  I know R and his sister, N have had difficulties in life.  I relate a lot with N.  I think she carries the weight of her mom's care while her 3 brothers moved to other states.  I am good friends with R daughter,W.  W and and her sister both found themselves step daughters to a later wife of their father, and later half sisters to brothers later in life.  They have all managed to have a relationship with their dad, step mom and half brothers.  I respect that a lot.  When I visit with N and W, we talk about this some.  We also laugh a lot and talk about a lot of other things.  So, basically it is just snippets.  I want to delve into this a little bit with W next time I see her.  It just so happens that she is coming back to town in December and we will all get together.  Until then, I will think some of the uncomfortable feelings of why my dad moved on and let his wife create a life without my sister and I.  I will think of the young half brother that I don't know and continue to pray earnestly for him and remind myself that while I don't get along with his mother or sister, I am glad he seems to be close to them and have a loving family unit.  Sometimes it is not about me at all.  After all, if I let myself get melancholy about this 1)  it is water under the bridge with my dad, he is gone.  2)  it affects me and my life and that is not fair to DH.  I have so much to be grateful for, that I don't have room for that old stuff anymore.  3)  I have seen what bitterness can do to other people.  And I am thankful for the reminders I had this weekend and to keep learning, keep growing and keep changing.  I will go to hot yoga tonight and I will more effectively breathe it out and let it go.  After all, I witnessed a man in his 70's accused of being selfish and soft of uncaring (like my own father) take the time to visit his elderly mother, bring her across town just to see her 98 y/o SIL and comfront misty eyed memories, all while being lovely and polite and attentive to 2 of my favorite little old ladies in the world.  I choose to focus on this, rather than my own demons.While I wait for work this morning, I will enjoy a nice hot cup of tea and listen to the annual Halloween podcasts I enjoy.  Have a great day before Halloween.  I know I will!"},

{"title": "Ready for long weekend", "date": "Monday, October 23, 2017", "text": "10/19/17Ready for long arts & craft weekend, except I am tiredI have been getting ready for 2 weeks for my girls weekend with my sister, neice, aunts and cousins.  Now it is the day I will leave work early and drive down with one of my aunt's (M2).  I am driving my husband's car today, it is an older smaller sedan, and gets better gas mileage than my SUV.  M2 will have her husband bring her down to where i work so we can go from there in the other direction in my car.  M1, my other aunt is going 3 hours out of her way to pick up her grand daughter.  I am glad the grand daughter wants to come (she has come before when her cousins have come), but I am glad I don't have to add an extra 3 hours today and 3 hours sunday to my drive, because I am tired.  They probably won't get to RH until midnight.  Plus, I will have quite a few things to do Sunday to get ready for another 50 hour week.  I had hoped we could all ride together, but it is out of my hands.  My 2 aunts (M1 and M2) both live in the city I currently live in.  They are my mother's sisters.  I don't like to drive at night if I don't have to and I get sleepy around 10pm.  My main thing about avoiding the extra 3 hours is that my cousin and her SIL will be there at around 6 or 7pm to my RH and I felt uncomfortable hosting with people just waiting for me in my house.  I want to get there, get unloaded.  Open the blinds, turn on the AC, turn on some lights, sweep out any dead bugs, God forbid.  When you don't live full time in a house, there is the constant battle with bugs.  It is a pain.  We also have some issues with mildew from the house being shut up so tight and not enough air movement.  I feel really uncomfortable having guests get there before I do.  And not by a little while, by hours.  My cousin and I are close enough, I don't worry about that.  But I have never met her SIL and my cousin has only been to my house once.  I am sure I will be on the phone with her trying to direct her in.  I don't want to be driving through the hilly terrain in the dark with 3 women in the car, perhaps talking with each other.  I am bringing everyone a pint of my apple butter and the pie I froze.  I packed it in ice in my car while I work 8 hours today.  I am currently  waiting on a project.  I hope this day goes by fast.  The sun is coming up and I am enjoying my nice hot tea.  I am excited about the weekend, but as a host, I always worry will everything run smoothly and will people have a nice time.  I also worry about who has to sleep on the sofa bed, because I know it is not the most comfortable.  But, it is nice to enjoy the fall with some women in my family who mean the world to me.  After our mom passed away, her sisters enjoy an even more important part of my life and I know my sister D3 feels the same way.  I am also excited to be bringing 2 crockpots that I can't use to my neice and nephew, a 3 drawer plastic storage unit, and 2 Halloween tubs of decorations for them to take and use/enjoy.  More stuff out of my CH.  Win win!  I sold a pair of boots and a nice leather jacket this past week that I have been trying to sell for 6 months.  I put that money in savings.  I paid my personal property taxes last week in the RH state ($600+).  And my credit card balance was empty until my Sam's run last night (ouch).  It just occurred to me that the $200 cash I stashed at CH I totally forgot.  Oh well, I have $50 cash on me and  cash stashed at RH, so I should be fine!  I am buying nothing at the craft fair (Friday) or the shopping center (Saturday)...unless it is a big metal state mascot to put on our barn (my husband calls it barn, I call it a shed).  I have debated making one cut out of particle board - I could save prob 75%, but my husband nor I have ever used a jig saw...stay tuned on that one!Have a great 3rd weekend of October fall weekend!  Enjoy your friends, family, traditions, sunshine, leaves, banana bread, apple butter, or pumpkin anything!  See you next week."},
{"title": "Me too", "date": "Wednesday, October 18, 2017", "text": "10/17/17Me TooAfter the recent news out of Hollywood about a producer being a long time predator against women in entertainment industry, there is a sweeping wave of \"me too\" being posted on social media by other women who have either been a victim of sexual harassment or sexual assault.  I made a comment on one of my friends' post, but I am too afraid to put my own #me too out there.  That is how something like this sticks with someone.  For.  The.  Rest.  Of.  Their.  Life.  Over the weekend, while watching a report on the news about it, I casually mentioned to my DH that not only does it happen to many women, such as myself, but more than once.  I wish my younger self had the perspective and wisdom of my older self in dealing with it.  I cannot write much about it now, maybe someday I will be able to.  But, I definitely have experienced both kinds of abuse...and not just once. In the industry I started out my career in...I was harassed, more than once.  And I worked in a bar as an 18 year old.  It happened there too.  At least thet told us we could smack someone for touchung us.  But I am sorry to say, I have not only been harassed, I have been assaulted to.  I wonder how many other women have been assaulted too.  And I have rarely ever spoken of it and certainly never written anything down about it.  How powerful are the feelings it causes...guilt, shame, anxiety...it may even begin for form perception of myself and others.  It can be something that one uses as a shield or a wall.  I did.  I worry the way our society is headed this problem is not going away anytime soon.  But at least victims can begin to heal faster/sooner...or better yet...avoid it."},

My husband broke his in with a walk with me Sunday- worth the price!  One donated, one to sell.  I also washed sheets and towels and got a pie (froze) ready for this upcoming girls weekend.  Too busy for projects with all the apples!  But I have given out 13 jars already and have fun all winter giving and enjoying the apple butter!  I went to see my Dear Grandmother (DG) Sat and took her and my aunt (PA) a jar.  My DG exclaimed \"it is still warm!\" and I barely had walked in the door when she was trying to open it and give it a sample.  I ran an errand at the store for her and so that made me feel good to help her feel good.  I won't get to see her for 2 weeks.  I have celebrated a couple of meaningful meetings with a couple of special women friends in my life and my gratitude cup is full.  I am happy for the present moment.  And then I come up with a title like today's post.

I will can the applebutter Sunday.  It is a big job, but is nice to get it finished.  Makes great gifts!I went on a nice walk after work Thursday and am almost finished with my latest audiobook.  It is about a woman who lost her husband and her life as she is dealing with that and deciding whether to date again in her 70's.  I did not even know what it was about when I checked it out of the library and downloaded it.  I just happenstance chose it.  But, I am enjoying her intellect and candid honesty.  She writes simply and effectively.  The subject matter just happens to resonate with me.  There was a passage I heard last night that made me stop on my walk and make note of it.  It was about how as the months have gone by and she is dealing with her loss, there are moments that she feels are almost intolerable, but just fleeting moments and then she is back from the floating feeling.  It was moving and beautiful.  I will write more on this later.  Another story for another day.  Maybe a rainy cold Sunday, writing from my office at home instead of a quick break at work, where I must be functional.  Have a great weekend!"},

We got to share couple dinners with my dear in laws, but SIL and BIL were away dealing with BIL mom's estate.  She passed this summer with a house so full of stuff, you could barely walk through it.  Literally a path.  Plus, she had barely a spot cleared on her bed large enough for her to sleep.  Between these stories and seeing my Aunt's (PA) place, i vow to give my stuff away while I am alive so I dont leave a mess like that to my loved ones.  We have no children (thats another post).  But I wouldnt want to put that on anyone.  My DGM (grandmother) has been great about this, every step of the way deciding she can no longer drive, downsizing from house to apt, moving from apt to indep living, etc.  She is my role model in aging (and many other things!)So. I will continue as long ad i am alive to be aware and organized, and hopefully proactive.  My MIL always cuts out articles on local history.  This time it was about a local lake and how a wealthy businessman from Chicago had arrived and built a resort.  The resort eventually flooded to create a lake.  My DH and I enjoy reading about history.  We enjoy her thought that we might enjoy reading something.  I wonder if hoarding is a newer phenomenon.  I suspect it is.  Maybe because stuff is so much more readily available.  I wonder about this, that is the type of dialoge in my head.  At least when I drive 4 hours home, my mind isnt doing such random thoughts.  If you have to work tomorrow, like me, have a great Monday.  We dont get Columbus Day if thus year at my firm.  But I am mighty grateful for the income."},

September is the best time to transplant established peonies. Begin by cutting the peony stems near ground level. Then carefully dig around and under each plant.\" Even though it is Oct, it is only the 7th day of Oct that I plan to move my peonies.  We are going to retirement house this weekend.  I have several things I want to get accomplished before we have our family annual craft fair weekend, in 3 weeks.  1)  paint the cubby around the water/ice dispenser on my side by side refridgerator.  It is white but this plastic insert has yellowed.  We just recently bought a new stove (oven died) and dishwasher.  I am not spending the money on a new fridge yet.  It works fine.  2)  I removed the glass shades from the small guest room fan to use on a painted/refurbished guest bathroom light.  I don't want the overhead lights anyway.  I just have to figure out how to take off that middle ring portion of the ceiling fan that houses the light sockets.  At least I hope this can be done.  3)  I am going to clean/paint some outdoor furniture.  4)  disconnect a built in light in the kitchen desk area, below the cabinets.  For 3+ years this has hung there when I unscrewed it from the cabinet so i could paint under it.  5)  move rocks out of outside planter bed and move my peonies to the planter bed.   When we bought our RH it was Labor Day weekend 2014.  There were 2 large raised planters on the Northwest side of the house that had scads of wild onion and weeds in them.  I read that you could basically compost cut grass and leaves and cardboard and not have to till a garden area.  Well, the leaves and grass would not stay put and all around the foundation of the house there were large fist size rocks just laying loose.  Like the ones that matched the foundation rocks, but just laying there.  I did not yet have a garden tractor or wheelbarrow, so I just put a bunch of these large rocks in my planters to help control weeds.   FAIL!   Now I have weeds + rocks! in the planters.  Now that I have both a garden tractor and a place to put these rocks, so time to move them!  The peonies are just scattered near my backdoor making an unsightly trap for leaves and \"things\", no telling what kind of creepy crawly things are in there.  I prefer a much more tailored landscaping plan near my house, esp near a door.  Ick."},

{"title": "Happiness", "date": "Wednesday, September 27, 2017", "text": "100 days of happiness! Ideas, concepts, trends, a dance, a song...go around on the web.  Like 40 days of lent cleaning out your house instead of giving something else up led me to a really great FB group that are all about organizing.  Then organizing led me to decluttering and decluttering led me to minimalism and that led me to be more aware of what I am focusing on in my life.  I will never be a true minimalist, but then, I don't want to be.  But I would like to have less clutter and stuff to worry about, esp as I prepare to move into a smaller home and move toward retirement.   100 days of happiness is something I saw on another blog and I may be a few days late, but I'm in!  Why wait till November to think more of what I am thankful for?!  100 days approx till the end of the year.  Can't believe it.  I am happy today for a life that is slower, a little more conscious and more focused on what I have, rather than what I am lacking.   I had to send a difficult email today to a colleague in another state for some free lance work he had me do.  I was a little puzzled at his request in the first place, for an envelope.  Everything in this state is done online, so the envelope really does not matter, but in his state it does.  And the client is in his state.  I was really upset that I cannot find the envelope but once I fessed up to him and sent the email after checking and rechecking my entire house (my house is in various stages of packing and moving).  I felt better that the email was over.  Pressed send, then will deal with his response.  It is what it is.  He responded.  Said don't lose any sleep, but if I find to send to him.  Well, there it is.  Oh well.  He may never ask me to do any more free lance, but things happen.  I am happy today that I am not going to let it ruin my day, just like I did not let a fall in the puddle walking in to work ruin my Tuesday.   Have a great Wednesday!"},
{"title": "Death", "date": "Tuesday, September 26, 2017", "text": "What a light subject.  I lost my mom (DLM) at a fairly young age.  I was 24.  She was only 47.  She lived for about 12 to 13 months after the diagnosis.  I had just moved 600 miles away to another state.  3 weeks after I relocated to another state, we learned about my mom's cancer.  My boyfriend, who was diagnosed the previous December with cancer.  He was 29.  My beloved late husband.  We got married in 1991.  More on DLM and BLH in other posts, I am sure.  There is a LOT to unpack there. My father (F) died just 3 years ago.  F was devastated when DLM died.  I worried a lot about F while I was working in a diff state, 600+ miles away, dealing with BLH cancer.  But, F remarried soon.  To C (crazy).  C was crazy, but not mean.  Just crazy and selfish.  She took half of what 1)  my dad and my mother had worked 30 years together to build.  She and F had a bumpy marriage, surprise.  Enough about C.  If I come back here, it will be because of how F let this all happen.  Not because of C.  C was opportunistic.  Eventually my husband (BLH) passed away, I was 26.  2 years to the month after my mom passed.  That was the closest I ever was to F, when he supported me after losing BLH.  He and my dear grandmother came to my home in another state and helped me through the hospital, the dying and the memorial, funeral and burial.  They were very supportive of me.  Looking back, I know how hard this must have been for them, both of them also being widowed.  And they loved BLH, he was a GREAT guy.  Plus, I have always been very close to my DGM.  Not too long after that, F and C parted ways.  F eventually married A.  A was 3 years older than I.  But my DGM and my sister and I were hopeful that F had found someone to make him happy.  Fast forward about 20 years later and F is on his death bed from cancer.  By now, A has made it clear to DG, D3 and I that she does not like us.  Over the years, once my DGM became too old to host holidays, we stopped getting together.  My sister and I each lived in different states.  DGM lived in same city as F and A.  A said to my DGM that A hated having people in her home.  Told us she did not want to exchange gifts and once got furious when I bought my sister a gift, but not buy A's daughter.  Over the years when A would be mean to my sister and my DG, I would speak up.  A and F have a boy.  His only boy.  I tried to get to know my half brother, but it was hard since he is 30 years younger than me.  Most of this, I took in stride, understanding that A just wanted to be a family with F and not have 2 young women barely younger than herself as her \"instant family\".  But when A was mean to my DGM and sister, I spoke up.  It affect my relationship with F.  The tipping point was when my F and A starting taking money from DGM.  I had enough.  DGM was selective in what she would share with me, knowing my relationship with F was already strained.  Eventually, it started coming out because DGM got older and more frail and it began to take a toll on her.  By this time, I could not longer tolerate the casual once or twice breazy phone conversations F tried to initiate with me, knowing what he was doing to his own mother.  So, I told F I could not just go on like this, casually speaking once a year and meeting once a year at a restaurant for Christmas, usu in January.  I called F to tell A to stop putting my DGM in the middle.  If they wanted to ask questions about me, then call me.  Period.  I was not going to play that game. I did not have a big falling out with F.  I just told him that when I came to town to see DGM, I would not be continuing to make attempts to see him because it was too painful for me.  I was worried about DGM and how they were treating her.  So, in the new technological age of 2012 I unfriended F on FB!  Very anticlimactic.  It was like pulling off a bandaid for me.  Quick and clean.  My sister, D3 wisely left the door cracked open.   Anyway, the reason all this came up in my mind is a relationship in my life now with F's sister, my aunt (A1).  A1 sort of went along with F and A, using DGM's resources.  I worry a lot about 1)  whether DGM will have enough resources at the end and 2) her state of mind knowing how her kids have acted and 3)  her state of mind already thinking she has lived too long and if she was dead, then they would have received their inheritance.  I have tried to relay this end of life message to A1.  This past weekend, I was a little more direct.   I know these things to be true because when F was diagnosed with cancer in 2013, I decided I could not let him die without making amends.  For my sake and DGM sake.  So, I called him.  I went to see him about a week after he was diagnosed.  We had some casual catching up to do and I just tried to smooth things over, be positive and helpful.  It was one of the hardest things I have ever done. DH encouraged this truce.  So, even while the dependence on my DGM intensified, I was supportive of her helping her son.  As long as she felt like she could afford it, I was on board.  Then, after about 8 months, F stopped treatment.  The request for money became a request for part of her estate, now, before my dad passed.  DGM finally had to say no.  I enlisted my DH to get involved.  A had always liked DH.  DH is a nice, tall, handsome man.  DH is quiet and thoughtful.  DH used to be a police.  DH knows how to exert an air of authority.  DH knows how to calm emotional family situations.  A trusted him.  DH and I called a meeting with A, as F lay dying and my DGM was sick with worry.   DH told A that she needed to \"man\" up and assure her dying husband that she and AJ (their son) would survive without him.  That F lived a good life and left a wonderful legacy of a son and they would miss him - but they would survive.  She assured DH that she had told F as much.  DH explained to her that F had told me and his mother that he was afraid for A and AJ. She tried to deny again, but then she admitted that she was indeed scared she would lose the house and would have to move and she did not want to.  She wanted AJ to be able to stay in the same home after his father died.  She worried how AJ would pay for college.  She admitted that they all figured DGM would have died and left money for them to pay off their house and pay for AJs college.  And she cried and agreed that she would try harder to reassure F.  It was only in the subsequent moments of reflection that DH and I recounted this strange conversation and realized the gravity of the admissions A made.  To this day, we still marvel at how selfish and weak A was, as we tried to teach her how to support a dying loved one. I am now in the stages of navigating a similar message with DGM daughter.  A woman in her late 70's.  A 70 year old woman who expects others to help her.  I recently helped her.  I don't feel used, but I feel tired.  And blessed.  Because the F that I saw who let his values become negotiable, is the same F who taught me my work ethic.  I guess it was more my mom who taught me the value of a dollar."},
{"title": "Two Steps Forward", "date": "Sunday, September 24, 2017", "text": "One step back.  At least that beats one step forward, two steps back.  Some great strides in decluttering and saving, then I see something shiney.  Oh well.  I had saved up some money for a couple of things and so I feel ok as long as I try to stay away from impulse buying.  I had planned to get something nice for DH retirement and now that is out of the way.  I can work almost a year trying to add back to my savings to make up for that.   Lots of festivals this time of the year and that is so fun!  Yesterday we went to an art show and a car show.  We had a great time, even though it was in the 90's and humid!  We also went to a great meal out Friday night and they serve family style, so LOTS of leftovers!  Also 3 friends have given us fresh produce, so I am not going to the store until late in the week, we are working on our pantry and freezer.   Today we are going to a movie which is a rare treat.  We almost always do matinees due to keeping cost down.  Then we go pick up our used car that has been very challenging with all the repairs we had to shell out within months of owning it.  But I look at it like, now the vehicle has basically been rebuilt, so should last us several years.  My DH also sold his newer truck recently so we could put that money in the bank to be able to pay off RH when we sell our CH.  It should happen still.  I also recently did a small financial assist for a family member and gave to Red Cross for hurricane and bought a shirt to help animal shelter.  So, that makes me feel really good. This weekend, I thoroughly cleaned master bath everything!  Lights, doors, baseboard and floor.  I will finish up tonight with scrubbing the grout.  I also caulked a place around front door window panel and repainted that trim.  I read another blog who recommended you hire an inspector to go through and point out stuff you can address beforehand.  I may just have BIL who has built houses do that.  I also have a friend who is really good at staging and when she was here last month, she gave me lots of ideas that I wrote down on a list.  I did not get rid of much this weekend, but now that we will have our big SUV back, I can take a giant lamp to my aunt (A2) and I am taking a large houseplant and 2 giant planters to my SIL2.  I wish I had started blogging sooner so I could remember all the stuff I have sold, given away to family/friends and given to thrift stores.  It has been pretty substantial.  Here are a few examples:  clothes, shoes, jewelry, collectibles of certain name brands sold.  I have used Facebook market place, ebay and Poshmark.  Furniture: FB, garage sales and Craigslist.  Plus I have given plenty away.  Sentimental stuff goes back to where I got it, or on to younger people in my family.  Sporting goods, expensive small items mostly ebay.  I had a freezer that we called bulk item pick up and I have put several large things we don't want, that have little value that I have sat by the curb with a \"free\" sign during our neighborhood garage sale.  I will do a whole post on Poshmark sometime.  All these things I have probably make over $5000 in the past 2 years.  I also gave away some large houseplants free on Craigslist.  The older I get, the more I think about cleaning and maintaining certain things.  I am getting tired of houseplants, but I still keep a few.  DH and I really hate to kill houseplants.  I would rather give it away.  My health condition is cooperating with me great this weekend, feel great!  I walked yesterday before it got warm and I will walk later today again, AFTER the NFL game! Hope you are getting a lot of fall projects tackled!"},
{"title": "First day of fall Friday", "date": "Friday, September 22, 2017", "text": "So I got my walk in last evening after work.  It was nice, a little warm but nice therapy.  I have been walking regularly (I jogged for a few years) for over 30 years, since I graduated from high school.  I walk outside and inside.  I have gone through two treadmills.  I just sold my last one to downsize.   I walk as much for relaxation as anything.  The weather lately is not like fall, it is in the high 80's low 90's and pretty humid.  Oh well, it won't last long.  We need rain at RH or I rely on my in laws to keep things alive and I hate for them to have to worry about it.  My DH parents and sister are great to help us when we need to, or we could have never bought this house and started getting it ready for when we retire ahead of time, like we have done.   This month officially makes it 3 years that we have been dealing with 2 house payments, 2 insurance, 2 real estate taxes, 2 utilities...it has been great, but a little stressful (first world problems).  But we could not have done it without dear IL and my SIL and BIL.   Today SIL had to oversee 2nd delivery of our new dishwasher.  The first one they installed had large defect in the surface covering about 1/3 of the front panel.  Our existing appliances there are white (I hate) and the cabinets are white (I love).  We could not find a nice updated slide in electric range (and were not willing to tear up entire floor to run gas line) in white, so we got stainless.  I have heard all the stories of fingerprints, smears, etc.  But white was not working out and we did not want black.  The kitchen is sort of small and a little closed off and the black would have been way to dark for the space.   The house itself is small ish 1400+ square feet.  Our current city house is about 2700, but has a large storage area and 2 full living areas.  We felt it important to go slightly smaller and with true range/one story lay out.  This RH is also older than CH, but we fell better built.  So both houses seem to have things they need at the same time - that has been fun.  This year we have purchased a water heater and washer/dryer (CH) and a roof, range/oven and dishwasher (RH).  At least we have paid case as we have gone along.   Also last year we finished more laminate floors in CH (to get it ready to sell) and enclosed a car port at RH.  Next will be a new AC for RH, but at least we got the one for CH purchased a couple of years ago (the unit on CH was less than 10 years old and just quit).   I am told that builder grade things are like that and we see this over and over in CH.  Even how the siding and doors/windows on the SW side was done wrong, leading to water rushing in when we first moved in and requiring a sump pump in the basement - which all fell on us and HOA, instead of the builder (not my decision, this was the mindset of the HOA person/hired by builder).  This eventually has lead to ever increasing HOA fees and a deficit to our neighborhood account.  Some of my neighbors are very concerned and try to get answers and some of the neighbors seem to just \"trust\" it will all work out.  DH and I are just looking forward to getting away from it before there is a large assessment.   Oh, and while we feel lucky home prices seem to be rising which is good for sellers, taxes on both places has risen steadily in the past 3 years.  We are really basically just over the stress of two places.  Well, this weekend I have not decided what my project will be at CH to do something to help the process of selling it.  There are plenty of things to do.  Maybe I will scrub the white grout in the master bath.  Whose idea was it to use white anyway?  Duh.  There are lots of fall festival type activities in the city this weekend and a movie we want to see, so we will have some fun and make run to appreciate my gratitude for the present and not wish my time away too fast!  Hope you have a great weekend if you are reading this, thanks for stopping by."},
{"title": "Thursday walk day", "date": "Thursday, September 21, 2017", "text": "Well, I managed to get GM books up to date.  She is fastidious about doing her \"books\" since she was a bookkeeper by trade in her younger years.  She also worked at a boutique and was a later in life artist.  Her enjoyment of clothes and shoes is evident as soon as you see her and her painting talent is evident as soon as you see her artwork.   My DH and I hung as much as we could fit on the walls, all around her apartment so she can enjoy it.  I share her love of clothes and art (although I have not indulged in learning to paint nearly as much as I would like, maybe in my retired/semi-retired years?).  She really began painting in earnest once my GF was killed in a tragic accident, when she was in her 50's and became a talented and sought after artist who sold her paintings and paid for her trips in her Golden years with her fellow-widow Sister in Law.  SIL is still alive also, in her early 90's and lives about 30 miles away in her assisted living facility.   Up until about a year and a half ago, GM and I would shop regularly.  Then she started having some issues with her health and became unable to get out as much.  I still help her by ordering things for her and buying from the stores and bringing things to her to approve or disapprove of!  She enjoys the compliments others in her independent living facility give her about her cute clothes and shoes.   I DO NOT share her love of bookkeeping!  I took over her books last year mid-year, so I basically just continue the entries as she started and with her direction.  When the new year started, she got sick and it took me about 4 months to get the entries to balance out because her annuity and pensions adjust  as do her insurance costs and so it is confusing.   Then this summer there were some atypical entries and I was stressed about getting July and August done, which I finally did last night, to both our relief.  She had her baseball game on blaring so she could keep track of the happenings and I worked on the entries in the background.  Tonight I hope to go straight home after work and take a 4 mile walk listening to my library book since I missed Tues because I was tired and not feeling well.   I am going to attempt to include a photo of the gallery wall I did in my RH living room.  The deer jumping is a large cross stitch done by my dear late mother (DLM) that I found last summer, the deer head was one of DH trophies, the barn and the pheasant were painted by my dear GM and the landscape painting was done by my dear MIL.  The small pheasant pictures are thrift store finds.  Have a great Thursday!"},
{"title": "Wednesdays with GM", "date": "Wednesday, September 20, 2017", "text": "Well I made an error in my first blog post ever.  I guess everyone refers to family members by initials.  So, I should have typed DH instead of husband.  I don't even know what the D stands for, 'dear'?  Anyway, it's a learning curve.  Today I am not nearly as talkative as I felt yesterday.  Maybe that is part of the curve.  Like, where to start...what to say...Today in the Midwest it is pretty warm for this time of the year, highs in the high 80's.  So, I actually enjoyed wearing a dress and sandals to work today, but with a jacket because it is always freezing cold at my office.  After work on Wed I usu go visit my 98 year old grandmother.  GM I guess.  How lucky I feel to have a GM who is 98 years old.  I turned 50 this year.  My folks are both deceased.  Cancer.  I lost my mom early, she was in her 40's and I was in my 20's when she died.  This GM is my paternal GM.  My dad passed away 3 years ago.  So, after my dad passed, we moved GM away from my dad's city to the city where I live now.  My paternal aunt (PA), her daughter also lives here.  One of the people I will be very sad to move away from is GM.  When she moved here 3 years ago she never expected to be alive at 98.  I am glad she is, but I try to pray for God's will.  I was mindful of this this past spring and tried to come to terms with what He might have in store.  I pray my GM will not go through a long, protracted decline.  She got sick after having a surgery in March, just before her 98th birthday and for a few weeks, we really thought we were going to lose her.  It was a long spring.  She lives alone in an independent living facility.  Her meals are fixed for her and her apartment is cleaned/linens washed.  She does her own personal laundry.  She likes books on tape and baseball.  She cannot hear or see well so her quality of life has diminished a lot.  She has a lot of friends who visit and call her.  This past year I have really seen this diminish too.  She gets anxious because she can't understand when people try to talk to her and when she asks people to speak up, often they just repeat what they said in the exact same tone.  I can imagine how frustrating that would be.  So, I go visit once a week and call at least once a week.  I wish I could do more, but she is about 50 miles from where I live on other side of the city.  My work is about 1/2 in between, so it is handy to go see her on Wed or Fri after work. On these days, I try to have DH dinner pre planned, because he does not cook and would resort to snacks and unhealthy stuff...or just eat nothing.  Ugggghhh. Lately I am doing a stretch of OT at work and this has gone on since July.  I try to get an extra 5 to 10 hours a week on top of my usu 40.  It has helped me get a few things for retirement house (RH).  I bought a new window, a new stove and a new dishwasher.  More on RH later.  In my posts, I want to include something about what I am doing to prepare for that move.  Some days, it seems very little.  But, really just working and paying bills, saving and paying as we go for improvements/projects is as good as it gets, and for that I am grateful.  I also try to do at least one small project at city house (CH) a weekend while I am in town.  We go to RH about once or twice a month.  Lately, we have done less of that because of my OT.  So, this past weekend I regrouted between the sink and the counter the length of my center island where the sink is.  I know, ambitous, huh?.  I also put out 2 heavy dehumidifiers that we will no longer need/have room to store at RH.  RH does not have a basement either, while CH does.  They were marked free and both were taken.  It was our neighborhood fall garage sale this past weekend, so that felt good.  The week before that I sold my treadmill and elliptical that I stored (and used) in large basement storage room in CH.  I was a little surprised they sold so quick and both together.  This winter I will have to be a little creative in my workouts and I will also just up my yoga a bit.  Well, back to work...See you again soon."},
{"title": "Gotta start somewhere...", "date": "Tuesday, September 19, 2017", "text": "So I have been fascinated with the process of a blog for several years.  My favorite blogs to read are ones where people just talk about life.  I especially like when one is blogging for an event or change.  So, rather than regale my friends and family into listening to my stories over and over about how much joy I am getting from reducing my clutter and getting ready to move 225 miles away (this bring sadness to family and friends I will be moving away from), I thought I would talk to the blogosphere and see if I can meet some like-minded folks out there.Plus, I have a really teadious job that gives me sometimes several days with not much to do, followed by furious crunch time work.  Very hard to find a balance.  I probably should have called my blog Finding Balance, but that would suggest much more zen type of content, which I probably would fall wearily short.My husband is getting ready to retire in 10 months.  283 days, 6 hours, 15 minutes and 25 seconds...give or take.  Who's counting?  Part of what attracted me to this idea is the intention to write through this process and see if I was able to, wanted to, keep this up for the 10 months.  Another part of me wants to see what writing is like since I will have a lot of free time (God willing) once we retire and move.  My husband is a little older than I am, so I am not sure I will totally retire or work a 3rd career (I have already been through 2 careers, not counting all the work/jobs I did since I was 12 years old up until I graduated from college).  I think I am a bit too young, restless, impatient, spendthrifty...scared, OK scared is a fair word.  I am a bit scared of what this will bring.  Some of my fear is about money, but about equally scarey is what my life will look like...will I like myself?  Will I feel I am accomplishing enough?  Will I?...what if?...what about?...I have learned that journaling is a good thing.  But I want more than just journaling.  I want to get to know others out there who are going through something, needing a bit of contact.  Not only are we relocating...we are moving to a very small town from a decent sized Midwestern city.  We are going south about 225 miles to another state.  We want it a bit warmer (me, not too warm).  I have lived in this state before, in another life.  Well not really, but I lived there over 20 years ago.  I liked it there very much, but I was younger and single and restless and in career-mode.  I am not really scared about the small town part, I grew up in a REALLY small town.  My husband has never lived in another state.  But he and I are both sick of the city and sick of the pace and sick of having to get out and get around in the cold.  More tomorrow, I hope.  We'll see how this"}
